We studied the effects of AMG-458 on 2 NSCLC cell lines.;3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assays assessed the sensitivities of the cells to AMG-458. Clonogenic survival assays illustrated the radiosensitizing effects of AMG-458. Western blot for cleaved caspase 3 measured apoptosis. Immunoblotting for c-Met, phospho-Met (p-Met), Akt/p-Akt, and Erk/p-Erk was performed to observe downstream signaling.;AMG-458 enhanced radiosensitivity in H441 but not in A549. H441 showed constitutive phosphorylation of c-Met. A549 expressed low levels of c-Met, which were phosphorylated only in the presence of exogenous hepatocyte growth factor. The combination of radiation therapy and AMG-458 treatment was found to synergistically increase apoptosis in the H441 cell line but not in A549. Radiation therapy, AMG-458, and combination treatment were found to reduce p-Akt and p-Erk levels in H441 but not in A549. H441 became less sensitive to AMG-458 after small interfering RNA knockdown of c-Met; there was no change in A549. After overexpression of c-Met, A549 became more sensitive, while H441 became less sensitive to AMG-458.;AMG-458 was more effective in cells that expressed higher levels of c-Met/p-Met, suggesting that higher levels of c-Met and p-Met in NSCLC tissue may classify a subset of tumors that are more sensitive to molecular therapies against this receptor.",

It was recently reported that two receptors, Notch-1 and c-Met, correlate directly or indirectly with the initiation and development of malignant tumors, such as lung cancer; however, the prognostic value of coexpression of these receptors and their relationship in resected NSCLC was not clear. In this study, the expression levels of Notch-1 and c-Met in 117 patients with resected NSCLC were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results showed that the positive expression rate of Notch-1 in total patients was 59.8 %. The positive expression rate of c-Met in the all population was 69.2 %. In addition, a significant positive association was shown between Notch-1 and c-Met (P < 0.001). Simultaneously, patients with coexpression of both receptors had a significantly poorer prognosis than those without coexpression (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that T stage (P = 0.016) and c-Met expression (P < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors.

        "Doc_abstract":"The c-Met receptor is a potential therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Signaling interactions between c-Met and the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been studied extensively, but signaling intermediates and biological consequences of lateral signaling to c-Met in EGFR wild-type tumors are minimally understood. Our observations indicate that delayed c-Met activation in NSCLC cell lines is initiated by wild-type EGFR, the receptor most often found in NSCLC tumors. EGFR ligands induce accumulation of activated c-Met, which begins at 8 h and continues for 48 h. This effect is accompanied by an increase in c-Met expression and phosphorylation of critical c-Met tyrosine residues without activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or Akt. Gene transcription is required for delayed c-Met activation; however, phosphorylation of c-Met by EGFR occurs without production of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or another secreted factor, supporting a ligand-independent mechanism. Lateral signaling is blocked by two selective c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), PF2341066 and SU11274, or with gefitinib, an EGFR TKI, suggesting kinase activity of both receptors is required for this effect. Prolonged c-Src phosphorylation is observed, and c-Src pathway is essential for EGFR to c-Met communication. Pretreatment with pan-Src family kinase inhibitors, PP2 and dasatinib, abolishes delayed c-Met phosphorylation. A c-Src dominant-negative construct reduces EGF-induced c-Met phosphorylation compared with control, further confirming a c-Src requirement. Inhibition of c-Met with PF2341066 and siRNA decreases EGF-induced phenotypes of invasion by ~86% and motility by ~81%, suggesting that a novel form of c-Met activation is utilized by EGFR to maximize these biological effects. Combined targeting of c-Met and EGFR leads to increased xenograft antitumor activity, demonstrating that inhibition of downstream and lateral signaling from the EGFR-c-Src-c-Met axis might be effective in treatment of NSCLC.",

The aim of this study is to determine the role of HGF/c-Met pathway and its association with invasion related markers and clinicopathologic parameters in NSCLC. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 63 paraffin-embedded NSCLC tumor sections. The expressions of invasion related markers such as Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, Tissue Inhibitor Metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1 and 3 and RhoA were also examined. Co-expression of HGF/c-Met was significantly associated with lymph node invasion and TIMP-3 and RhoA overexpressions. There were positive correlation between TIMP-3 overexpression and advanced stage and negative correlation between RhoA overexpression and survival. DNA sequencing for Met mutations in both nonkinase and tyrosine kinase (TK) domain was established. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in sema domain and two SNPs in TK domain of c-Met were found. There was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of c-Met alterations and clinicopathologic parameters except shorter survival time in cases with two SNPs in TK domain. These results suggest that HGF/c-Met might exert their effects in tumor progression in association with RhoA and probably with TIMP-3.

Mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met), both of which are receptor tyrosine kinases, have been identified in a considerable percentage of NSCLC patients. EGFR and c-Met share the same downstream pathways and cooperate not only in promoting metastasis but also in conferring resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies in NSCLC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNAs, usually 21-25 nucleotides long, and are critical in regulating gene expression. Abnormal miRNA expression has been implicated in the initiation and progression in many forms of cancers, including lung cancer. In this study, we found that miR-200a is downregulated in NSCLC cells, where it directly targets the 3'-UTR of both EGFR and c-Met mRNA. Overexpression of miR-200a in NSCLC cells significantly downregulates both EGFR and c-Met levels and severely inhibits cell migration and invasion. Moreover, in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to gefitinib, a drug often used in TKI therapies to treat NSCLC, miR-200a expression is able to render the cells much more sensitive to the drug treatment.

In such pathologic situation, many alterations of this receptor were noticed that include transcriptional overexpression, gene amplification, somatic or germline mutations and/or ligand dependent autocrine/paracrine loops. More recently it has also been suggested that c-Met would be involved in resistance to targeted therapies directed towards EGFR or angiogenesis. Major efforts from a large number of pharmaceutical companies are invested dedicated to evaluate the efficacy of either small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies directed against c-Met or its unique ligand HGF. A series of promising results from the first completed clinical trials indicated that compounds targeting c-Met have an acceptable toxicity profile and that efficacy was noticed in some treated patients. Non squamous NSCLC patients that express more often high levels of c-Met seemed to represent a most sensitive subset for and anti-c-Met/erlotinib therapy. Many Phase III trials are currently recruiting and a particular effort was performed in order to discover biomarkers associated with efficacy and patient selection.

EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC patients (n = 29) and corresponding tumor specimens, and 53 samples of postoperative TKI-naïve NSCLC patients were collected. EGFR exon 19, 20, and 21 mutations were analyzed. And c-MET gene copy number was determined. The EGFR T790M mutation in exon 20 was not detected in the population of 53 TKI-naïve patients, but found in 48.3% (14/29) of the enrolled TKI-resistant patients. c-MET was amplified in 3.8% (2/53) of the TKI-naïve NSCLC patients and highly amplified in 17.2% (5/29) of the cohort. Most of T790M mutations were frequently associated with non-smoker, adenocarcinoma and EGFR activating mutations. Three male patients with T790M mutation occurred with wild-type EGFR, and were resistant to the treatments following TKI resistance. Features of c-MET amplification in TKI-naïve patients were indistinguishable from TKI-resistant patients. In the group of wild-type EGFR, patients with T790M mutation had median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as 9.6 months and 12.6 months, respectively; whereas the median PFS and OS of c-MET amplified patients was 4.1 months and 8.0 months, respectively. These results suggest that EGFR T790M mutation and c-MET amplification can occur in TKI-resistant NSCLC with wild-type EGFR, and these genetic defects might be related to different survival outcome. c-MET amplification in TKI-naïve or -resistant patients might share similarities in clinicopathologic features.",

The antagonists were also tested in a xenograft model using SCID mice.;EGCG inhibited cell proliferation in erlotinib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines, including those with c-Met overexpression, and acquired resistance to erlotinib. The combination of erlotinib and EGCG resulted in greater inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation than either agent alone. EGCG also completely inhibited ligand-induced c-Met phosphorylation and partially inhibited EGFR phosphorylation. The triple combination of EGCG/erlotinib/SU11274 resulted in a greater inhibition of proliferation than EGCG with erlotinib. Finally, the combination of EGCG and erlotinib significantly slowed the growth rate of H460 xenografts.;EGCG is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation, independent of EGFR inhibition, in several NSCLC cell lines, including those resistant to both EGFR kinase inhibitors and those overexpressing c-Met.

Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest a role for MET activation as both a primary oncogenic driver in subsets of lung cancer, and as a secondary driver of acquired resistance to targeted therapy in other genomic subsets. In this review, we explore the biology and clinical significance behind MET exon 14 (METex14) alterations and MET amplification in NSCLC, the role of MET amplification in the setting of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and the history of MET pathway inhibitor drug development in NSCLC, highlighting current strategies that enrich for biomarkers that are likely to be predictive of response. While previous trials that focused on MET pathway-directed targeted therapy in unselected or MET overexpressing NSCLC yielded largely negative results, more recent investigations focusing on METex14 alterations and MET amplification have been notable for meaningful clinical responses to MET inhibitor therapy in a substantial proportion of patients.",

However, the overall efficacies of TKIs are limited due to the development of drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of EGFR and c-Met TKI resistance in order to develop more effective therapies. Model NSCLC cell lines H1975 and H2170 were used to study the similarities and differences in mechanisms of EGFR/c-Met TKI resistance. H1975 cells are positive for the T790M EGFR mutation, which confers resistance to current EGFR TKI therapies, while H2170 cells are EGFR wild-type. Previously, H2170 cells were made resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib and the c-Met TKI SU11274 by exposure to progressively increasing concentrations of TKIs. In H2170 and H1975 TKI-resistant cells, key Wnt and mTOR proteins were found to be differentially modulated. Wnt signaling transducer, active β-catenin was upregulated in TKI-resistant H2170 cells when compared to parental cells. GATA-6, a transcriptional activator of Wnt, was also found to be upregulated in resistant H2170 cells. In H2170 erlotinib resistant cells, upregulation of inactive GSK3β (p-GSK3β) was observed, indicating activation of Wnt and mTOR pathways which are otherwise inhibited by its active form. However, in H1975 cells, Wnt modulators such as active β-catenin, GATA-6 and p-GSK3β were downregulated. Additional results from MTT cell viability assays demonstrated that H1975 cell proliferation was not significantly decreased after Wnt inhibition by XAV939, but combination treatment with everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) and erlotinib resulted in synergistic cell growth inhibition. Thus, in H2170 cells and H1975 cells, simultaneous inhibition of key Wnt or mTOR pathway proteins in addition to EGFR and c-Met may be a promising strategy for overcoming EGFR and c-Met TKI resistance in NSCLC patients.

Some actions of HGF are believed to be mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), resulting in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)). We examined four c-Met-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines for effects of HGF on COX-2. HGF increased COX-2 protein expression 3-fold over basal levels. Induction of COX-2 occurred through both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 pathways. HGF treatment caused activation of the activator protein-1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and cAMP response element-binding protein transcription factors, and COX-2 induction was blocked by actinomycin D. The half-life of COX-2 mRNA was also increased by HGF. HGF stimulation resulted in a 4-fold increase in PGE(2) secretion, and treatment of NSCLC cells with exogenous PGE(2) significantly increased cell proliferation. The addition of PGE(2) to NSCLC cells also led to rapid phosphorylation of c-Met in the absence of HGF, which was blocked by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition. EGFR ligands were released in response to PGE(2). This suggests that secretion of PGE(2) induced by HGF/c-Met pathway activation can further activate the c-Met pathway via EGFR in a reinforcing loop that is independent of HGF. HGF and PGE(2) each significantly stimulated invasion in NSCLC cells. Cells transiently transfected with c-Met antisense plasmid showed a significant decrease in HGF- or PGE(2)-induced invasion. PGE(2)-induced invasion was EGFR-dependent, confirming a link between PGE(2), EGFR, and c-Met. Targeting of both the HGF/c-Met and PGE(2) pathways with a neutralizing antibody to HGF and celecoxib resulted in enhanced anti-invasion effects in response to HGF.",

A phase I trial of PF-02341066 yielded a 53% response rate and a disease             control rate of 79%. We evaluated crizotinib as a potential radiation-sensitizing             agent in multiple established NSCLC cell lines with varying expression levels             of c-Met and EML4-ALK. The combined effect of ionizing radiation (IR) and PF-02341066             was determined by the surviving cell fraction, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis,             DNA double-strand break repair in 5 NSCLC cell lines (A549, H460, H3122, H2228             and H1993) and in in vivo xenograft studies.

Since heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) stabilizes various oncoproteins including EGFR and c-Met, the inhibition of Hsp90 activity appears as a rational strategy to develop anticancer drugs. Despite preclinical efficacy of geldanamycin-anasamycin (GA)-derivatives containing benzoquinone moiety as Hsp90 inhibitors, the hepatotoxicity of these GA-derivatives restricts their therapeutic benefit. We have prepared WK-88 series of GA-derivatives, which lack the benzoquinone moiety. In this study, we have examined the anticancer effects of WK88-1 in Met-amplified- and gefitinib-resistant (HCC827GR) NSCLC cells and its parental HCC827 cells. Treatment with WK88-1 reduced the cell viability in both HCC827 and HCC827GR cells, which was associated with marked decrease in the constitutive expression of Hsp90 client proteins, such as EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, Met and Akt. Moreover, WK88-1 attenuated phosphorylation of these Hsp90 client proteins and reduced the anchorage-independent growth of HCC827GR cells. Administration of WK88-1 did not cause hepatotoxicity in animals and significantly reduced the growth of HCC827GR cells xenograft tumors in nude mice. Our study provides evidence that ErbB3 might be a client for Hsp90 in Met-amplified NSCLCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibition of Hsp90 dampens the activation of EGFR- or c-Met-mediated survival of Met-amplified NSCLCs and that WK88-1 as a Hsp90 inhibitor alleviates gefitinib resistance in HCC827GR cells.

Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Met receptor families have been identified as important molecular targets for NSCLC. Two EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; erlotinib and gefitinib) are in current clinical use, but a majority of patients do not respond to these targeted therapies. We used receptor TK (RTK) capture arrays to identify receptors active in NSCLC cell lines. As Met and ErbBs were active, we explored the potential therapeutic advantage of combined targeting of Met with ErbB receptor family inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC. We found that Met physically interacts with both EGFR and Her2 in a NSCLC cell line with overexpression/overactivation of Met. Combined use of a dual EGFR/Her2 inhibitor with a Met inhibitor yields maximal growth inhibition compared with the use of EGFR and/or Met inhibitors. This suggests that simultaneous inhibition of multiple RTKs may be needed to effectively abrogate tumour cell growth. Phosphoproteomic analysis by RTK capture arrays may be a valuable tool for identifying the subset of tumours with functional receptor activation, regardless of mechanism.",

However, the initial tumor response is followed by recurrence. Several studies have suggested the importance of other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and downstream kinases as potential targets in the treatment of NSCLC. We used the multiple-RTK inhibitor AEE788, which inhibits EGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, with and without the downstream kinase inhibitor RAD001 (an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin). AEE788 inhibited cell growth more effectively than did erlotinib in three NSCLC cell lines examined (A549, H1650, and H1975). However, in the EGFR-TKI-resistant cell line H1975 harboring T790M resistance mutation, cell growth inhibition by AEE788 was only mild, and the phosphorylation of its leading targets such as EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 was not inhibited. In H1975, AEE788 induced significantly greater cell growth inhibition when combined with RAD001 than when used alone. This cooperative effect was not seen with the combination of erlotinib and RAD001. We found that c-Met was highly phosphorylated in this cell line, and the phosphorylated c-Met was inhibited effectively by AEE788. Using a phospho-RTK array, the phosphorylation of c-Met and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor was inhibited by AEE788. These results suggest that upstream RTK inhibitor overcomes the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI when combined with downstream kinase inhibitor. Thus, the combined inhibition of upstream and downstream RTKs is a promising strategy for the treatment of NSCLC.",

Positive expression of MET and cyclin D1 protein and increased MET gene copy number occurred in 59.0%, 59.0% and 18.0% of 61 NSCLC tissues, respectively.

There was a significant correlation between the expression of MET and MET gene copy number (P = 0.002). Additionally, the expression of cyclin D1 had a significant association with the expression of MET as well as MET gene copy number (P = 0.002 and P = 0.017, respectively).

However, promiscuous interactions between MET and ERBB family members have made it difficult to evaluate the effects of MET on EGFR signaling, both independent of drug treatment and in the context of drug resistance. We addressed this issue by establishing a 32D model cell system wherein ERBBs or MET are expressed alone and in combination. Using this model, we determined that EGFR signaling is sufficient to induce MET phosphorylation, although MET activation is enhanced by coexpression of ERBB3. EGFR-MET cross-talk was not direct, but occurred by a combined regulation of MET levels and intermediary signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). In NSCLCs harboring either wild-type or mutant EGFR, inhibiting EGFR or MAPK reduced MET activation and protein levels. Furthermore, MET signaling promoted EGFR-driven migration and invasion. Finally, EGFR-MET signaling was enhanced in a highly metastatic EGFR-mutant cell subpopulation, compared with the indolent parental line, and MET attenuation decreased the incidence of brain metastasis. Overall, our results establish that EGFR-MET signaling is critical for aggressive behavior of NSCLCs and rationalize its continued investigation as a therapeutic target for tumors harboring both wild-type and mutant EGFR at early stages of progression.",

Here we report that Met protein expression and phosphorylation were associated with primary resistance to EGFR TKI therapy in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, implicating Met as a de novo mechanism of resistance. In a separate patient cohort, Met expression and phosphorylation were also associated with development of NSCLC brain metastasis and were selectively enriched in brain metastases relative to paired primary lung tumors. A similar metastasis-specific activation of Met occurred in vitro in the isogenous cell lines H2073 and H1993, which are derived from the primary lung tumor and a metastasis, respectively, from the same patient. We conclude that Met activation is found in NSCLC before EGFR-targeted therapy and is associated with both primary resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy and with the development of metastases. If confirmed in larger cohorts, our analysis suggests that patient tumors harboring both Met activation and EGFR mutation could potentially benefit from early intervention with a combination of EGFR and Met inhibitors.",

The PAX5 protein expression was relatively strong in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC, 11/12); however, its expression was not detected in non-SCLC (NSCLC, n=13), mesothelioma (n=7), pancreatic (n=6), esophageal (n=6) and head and neck cancer cell lines (n=12). In comparison, PAX8 and PAX3 expressions were absent or non-detectable in SCLC cell lines; however, PAX8 was expressed in most of the tested NSCLC cell lines (13/13) and also frequently in all the other cell lines. We also detected frequent expressions of PAX2 and PAX9 protein in the various cell lines. Utilizing neuroendocrine tumor samples, we found that the frequency as well as the average intensity of the expression of PAX5 increased from pulmonary carcinoid (9%, moderate and strong PAX5 expression, n=44), to large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNC, 27%, n=11) to SCLC (33%, n=76). FISH analysis revealed no translocations of the PAX5 gene, but polyploidy in some SCLC tumor tissues (6/37). We determined that PAX5 could regulate the transcription of c-Met using luciferase-coupled reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. In addition, the phospho-c-Met (active form) and PAX5 were both localized to the same intra-nuclear compartment in hepatocyte growth factor treated SCLC cells and interacted with each other. Finally, we determined the therapeutic translational potential of PAX5 using PAX5 knockdown SCLC cells in conjunction with Topoisomerase 1 (SN38) and c-Met (SU11274) inhibitors. Loss of endogenous PAX5 significantly decreased the viability of SCLC cells, especially when combined with SN38 or SU11274, and maximum effect was seen when both inhibitors were used. Therefore, we propose that PAX5 could be an important regulator of c-Met transcription and a potential target for therapy in SCLC.",

EGF and HGF signaling intermediates were studied by western blotting. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assays. Cell motility was done by time lapse confocal microscopy.;c-Met and EGFR were both expressed in A549, H1838, H2170, SW900, SW1573, H358, SKLU-1, and H1993 non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Both EGF and HGF at 100 ng/ml in medium showed a synergistic effect on cell proliferation at 48-72 h as seen by a proliferation assay in A549, H1838, and SKMES cells. In A549 and H1838 cell lines, HGF (40 ng/ml) and EGF (5 ng/ml) induced synergistic phosphorylation on c-Met (Tyr 1003/1230/1234/1235). Additionally, synergistic phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473) and phospho-ERK1+ERK2 (Thr202/Tyr204) was also seen indicating that EGF and HGF could induce synergistic phosphorylation of important signaling intermediates. Treatment with EGF and HGF at 100 ng/ml for 2 h also leads to an additive effect in inducing cell motility (especially membrane ruffling) in H1993 cells.

But approximately half of NSCLC patients develop resistance to these therapies, where the MET proto-oncogene is amplified by EGFR through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. Here we report that endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (EPAS1), with 48% sequence identity to HIF-1α, specifically binds to TKI-resistant T790M EGFR, but not to wild-type EGFR, in NSCLC cell lines. Expression of EPAS1 enhances amplification of MET when simultaneously expressed with T790M EGFR but not with wild-type EGFR, and this enhancement is independent of ligand binding domain of EGFR. MET amplification requires EPAS1, since EPAS1 knock-down reduced MET levels. When NSCLC cells expressing T790M EGFR were treated with TKIs, reduced EPAS1 levels significantly enhanced the drug effect, whereas over-expression of EPAS1 increased the drug resistant effect. This EPAS1-dependent TKI-resistance was abolished by knocking-down MET, suggesting that EPAS1 does not cause TKI-resistance itself but functions to bridge EGFR and MET interactions. Our findings suggest that EPAS1 is a key factor in the EGFR-MET crosstalk in conferring TKI-resistance in NSCLC cases, and could be used as a potential therapeutic target in TKI-resistant NSCLC patients.

Deregulation of the HGF/MET signaling pathway can occur via different mechanisms, including HGF and/or MET overexpression, MET gene amplification, mutations or rearrangements. While the role of MET mutations in NSCLC is not yet fully understood, MET amplification emerged as a critical event in driving cell survival, with preclinical data suggesting that MET-amplified cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to MET inhibition. True MET amplification, which has been associated with poor prognosis in different retrospective series, is a relatively uncommon event in NSCLC, occurring in 1-7% of unselected cases. Nevertheless, in highly selected cohorts of patients, such as those harboring somatic mutations of the EGF receptor (EGFR) with acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), MET amplification can be observed in up to 20% of cases. Preclinical data suggested that a treatment approach including a combination of EGFR and MET TKIs could be an effective strategy in this setting and led to the clinical investigation of multiple MET TKIs in combination with erlotinib. Results from ongoing and future trials will clarify the role of MET TKIs for the treatment of NSCLC and will provide insights into the most appropriate timing for their use.",

In addition, MET amplification is an alternative resistance mechanism for escaping EGFR-targeted therapy. To assess the benefits of combined targeting of MET and EGFR for treating NSCLCs, we investigated the activities of these two RTK pathways in NSCLC cell lines and evaluated their responses to SGX523 and erlotinib, the small-molecule kinase inhibitors of MET and EGFR, respectively. We showed that MET interacts with and cross-activates EGFR in MET-amplified or -overexpressed cells. The inhibition of both MET and EGFR results in maximal suppression of downstream signaling and of cell proliferation when their ligands are present. Furthermore, we showed that SGX523 plus erlotinib strengthens anticancer activity in vivo in a cellular context-dependent manner. The combination led to the regression of H1993 tumors by enhancing the suppression of proliferation and inducing apoptosis, whereas H1373 tumor growth was significantly reduced by the combination via suppression of proliferation without inducing apoptosis. SGX523 alone was sufficient to achieve near-complete regression of EBC-1 tumors; its combination with erlotinib strongly inhibited the viability of a population of insensitive cells emerging from an SGX523-treated EBC-1 tumor recurrence. Our data suggest that inhibition of both MET and EGFR can enhance anticancer effects against NSCLCs in a context-dependent manner and thus provide a strong rationale for combining MET and EGFR inhibitors in treating NSCLCs.",

Among the downstream pathways of RTKs, the MAPK pathway is particularly important for cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In this study, the effects of MEK inhibitors (trametinib and PD0325901) in several NSCLC cell lines with driver gene alterations, especially RTK genes, were tested in vitro using an MTT assay, and a wide range of sensitivities was found. In particular, all the EGFR-mutated cell lines were resistant to MEK inhibitors, whereas all the MET-amplified cell lines were sensitive. A bioinformatics technique and western blot analyses showed that the PI3K/AKT pathway is more activated in EGFR-mutated NSCLC than in MET-amplified NSCLC, and a PI3K inhibitor enhanced the sensitivity to trametinib in the EGFR-mutated cell lines, suggesting that this pathway is associated with resistance to MEK inhibitors. Although the HCC827 cell line (EGFR mutation) was resistant to MEK inhibitors, the HCC827CNXR cell line, whose driver gene shifts from EGFR to MET, exhibited enhanced sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, indicating the biological importance of the MAPK pathway for MET-amplified NCSLC. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of crizotinib (a MET inhibitor) and trametinib was observed in MET-amplified NCLC cell lines. Our findings indicate that the MAPK pathway is biologically important for MET-amplified NSCLC and strongly encourage the development of combination therapy with a MET inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor against MET-amplified NSCLC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer related mortality with over 1 million cancer deaths worldwide. Numerous therapies have been developed for the treatment of lung cancer including radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Histology, stage of presentation and molecular aberrations are main determinants of prognosis and treatment strategy. Despite the advances that have been made, overall prognosis for lung cancer patients remains dismal. Chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy yield objective response rates of about 35% to 60% in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Even with good initial responses, median overall survival of is limited to about 12 months. This reflects that current therapies are not universally effective and resistance develops quickly. Multiple mechanisms of resistance have been proposed and the MET/HGF axis is a potential key contributor. The proto-oncogene MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor gene) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) interact and activate downstream signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathways that regulate gene expression that promotes carcinogenesis. Aberrant MET/HGF signaling promotes emergence of an oncogenic phenotype by promoting cellular proliferation, survival, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. The MET/HGF axis has been implicated in various tumor types including lung cancers and is associated with adverse clinicopathological profile and poor outcomes. The MET/HGF axis plays a major role in development of radioresistance and chemoresistance to platinums, taxanes, camtothecins and anthracyclines by inhibiting apoptosis via activation of PI3K-AKT pathway. DNA damage from these agents induces MET and/or HGF expression. Another resistance mechanism is inhibition of chemoradiation induced translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) thereby preventing apoptosis. Furthermore, this MET/HGF axis interacts with other oncogenic signaling pathways such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) pathway. This functional cross-talk forms the basis for the role of MET/HGF axis in resistance against anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF targeted therapies. MET and/or HGF overexpression from gene amplification and activation are mechanisms of resistance to cetuximab and EGFR-TKIs. VEGF inhibition promotes hypoxia induced transcriptional activation of MET proto-oncogene that promotes angiogenesis and confers resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. An extensive understanding of these resistance mechanisms is essential to design combinations with enhanced cytotoxic effects. Lung cancer treatment is challenging. Current therapies have limited efficacy due to primary and acquired resistance. The MET/HGF axis plays a key role in development of this resistance. Combining MET/HGF inhibitors with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy holds promise for improving outcomes. ",

Presence of mutations in the KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) driver oncogene may confer worse prognosis and resistance to treatment for reasons not fully understood. NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase), also known as DT-diaphorase, is a major regulator of oxidative stress and activator of mitomycins, compounds that have been targeted in over 600 pre-clinical trials for treatment of LC.

NQO1, ERK1/2, DNMT1, and DNMT3a but not c-MET and survivin expression was significantly more frequent in patients with KRAS mutations than those without, suggesting the following: (1) oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis, worse prognosis, and resistance to treatment reported in NSCLC patients with KRAS mutations, (2) selecting patients based on their KRAS mutational status for future clinical trials may increase success rate, and (3) since oxidation of nucleotides also specifically induces transversion mutations, the high rate of KRAS transversions in lung cancer patients may partly be due to the increased oxidative stress in addition to the known carcinogens in cigarette smoke.

SOX2 expression was inversely correlated to the expression of MET in NSCLC and mainly present in non-mutated NSCLC (r=-0.42, P<0.0001). There was a tendency for SOX2 to be expressed in SCCs and particularly in the part of SCC among ADSCs, whereas MET was mainly expressed in the part of ADC among ADSCs and ADCs. High level of MET and SOX2 expression were respectively demonstrated in ADCs and SCCs; MET activation was accompanied with exon 19 deletion in ADCs. EGFR and MET coordinate to drive tumorigenesis. Detection of the activation of MET and EGFR may be used for targeted drug therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death for solid tumors worldwide with an annual mortality of over one million. Lung carcinoma includes a series of different diseases which are roughly divided into two groups based on clinical and histo-pathological features: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for almost 80% of lung cancer diagnosis and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) responsible for the remaining 20%. The NSCLC molecular profile has been deeply investigated; alterations in several oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and transcription factors have been detected, mainly in adenocarcinomas. Dissection of such a complex scenario represents a still open challenge for both researchers and clinicians. MET, the receptor for Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), has been recently identified as a novel promising target in several human malignancies, including NSCLC. Deregulation of the HGF/MET signaling pathway can occur via different mechanisms, including HGF and/or MET overexpression, MET gene amplification, mutations or rearrangements. While the role of MET mutations in NSCLC is not yet fully understood, MET amplification emerged as a critical event in driving cell survival, with preclinical data suggesting that MET-amplified cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to MET inhibition. True MET amplification, which has been associated with poor prognosis in different retrospective series, is a relatively uncommon event in NSCLC, occurring in 1-7% of unselected cases. Nevertheless, in highly selected cohorts of patients, such as those harboring somatic mutations of EGFR with acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, MET amplification can be observed in up to 20% of cases. Preclinical data suggested that a treatment approach including a combination of EGFR and MET tyrosine kinases could be an effective strategy in this setting and led to the clinical investigation of multiple MET inhibitors in combination with anti-EGFR agents. Results from ongoing and future trials will clarify the role of anti-MET molecules for the treatment of NSCLC and will provide insights into the most appropriate timing for their use. The present review recapitulates the current knowledge on the role of MET signaling in NSCLC mainly focusing on its implications in molecular diagnostic approach and on the novel targeted inhibitors.

Here, we determined that Met-amplified gefitinib-resistant cells acquire dual resistance to inhibition of EGFR and Met tyrosine kinase activities. PC-9 lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring 15-bp deletions (Del E746_A750) in EGFR exon 19 were treated with increasing concentrations of the Met-TKI PHA665752 and 1 μmol/L gefitinib for 1 year; three resistant clones were established via Met amplification. The three dual-resistance cell lines (PC-9DR2, PC-9DR4, and PC-9DR6, designated as DR2, DR4, and DR6, respectively) exhibited different mechanisms for evading both EGFR and Met inhibition. None of the clones harbored a secondary mutation of EGFR T790M or a Met mutation. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/IGF1 receptor activation in DR2 and DR4 cells acted as a bypass signaling pathway. Met expression was attenuated to a greater extent in DR2 than in PC-9 cells, but was maintained in DR4 cells by overexpression of IGF-binding protein 3. In DR6 cells, Met was further amplified by association with HSP90, which protected Met from degradation and induced SET and MYND domain-containing 3 (SMYD3)-mediated Met transcription. This is the first report describing the acquisition of dual resistance mechanisms in NSCLC harboring an activating EGFR mutation to Met-TKI and EGFR-TKI following previous EGFR-TKI treatment.

In this study we modeled acquired resistance to experimental MET kinase inhibitor PF2341066 in MET-amplified non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines to identify drug resistance mechanisms that may arise in clinic. We found that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway emerges as a resistance mechanism in MET-amplified cells after prolonged exposure to PF2341066. Whereas combined inhibition of MET and EGFR kinases in MET-dependent NSCLC cells did not enhance their initial sensitivity to PF2341066, this combination dramatically suppressed the eventual emergence of drug-resistant clones after prolonged drug exposure. Conversely, activation of the EGFR pathway increased the yield of PF2341066-resistant clones, confirming the significance of this pathway in conferring resistance. Our findings support an intimate relationship between the EGFR and MET signaling pathways in NSCLC, and they suggest that combination treatment with MET and EGFR kinase inhibitors may be beneficial in MET-amplified NSCLC by reducing selection for drug resistant clones.",

In advanced NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line treatment has provided an unusually large progression-free-survival (PFS) benefit, a significantly high response rate (RR) and decreased toxicity when compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy in several phase III randomized trials; however, resistance invariably occurs. There are multiple mechanisms defined by which tumor cells may become independent of EGFR such as the well-characterized example of mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) amplification. Upon initial diagnosis of NSCLC, MET gene amplification is uncommon; however, acquired MET amplification has been noted in up to 20% of EGFR-mutated tumors that have been pretreated with an EGFR TKI. In tumors containing MET gene amplification, stimulation of the tumor occurs via the co-receptor HER-3 resulting in activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, thereby circumventing the effects of an EGFR TKI. Recently, the targeting of the MET pathway has been attempted with small molecules and with monoclonal antibodies.

Advances in our understanding of the underlying biology of NSCLC have revealed distinct molecular subtypes. A substantial proportion of NSCLC depends on oncogenic molecular aberrations (so-called \"driver mutations\") for their malignant phenotype. Personalized therapy encompasses the strategy of matching these subtypes with effective targeted therapies. EGFR mutations and ALK translocation are the most effectively targeted oncogenes in NSCLC. EGFR mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are successfully being targeted with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The number of molecular subgroups of NSCLC continues to grow. The scope of this review is to discuss recent data on novel molecular targets as ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, HER2, c-MET, RET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and DDR2. Thereby the review will focus on therapeutic strategies targeting these aberrations. Moreover, the emerging challenge of acquired resistance to initially effective therapies will be discussed. ",

However, the benefits of these agents are not uniform across the spectrum of nsclc, and optimizing their utility requires some degree of subgrouping of nsclc by the presence or absence of certain biomarkers.The biomarkers of current or imminent value are EGFR and KRAS mutational status, ALK rearrangements, and MET immunohistochemistry. As a predictor of benefit for anti-egfr monoclonal antibodies, EGFR immunohistochemistry is also of potential interest.Some of the foregoing biomarkers (EGFR, ALK, MET) are direct drivers of the malignant phenotype. As such, they are, quite rationally, the direct targets of inhibitory drugs. However, KRAS, while definitely a driver, has resisted attempts at direct pharmacologic manipulation, and its main value might lie in its role as part of an efficient testing algorithm, because KRAS mutations appear to exclude EGFR and ALK mutations. The indirect value of KRAS in determining sensitivity to other targeted agents or to pemetrexed remains controversial. The other biomarkers (EGFR, ALK, MET) may also have indirect value as predictors of sensitivity to chemotherapy in general, to pemetrexed specifically, and to radiotherapy and molecularly targeted agents.These biomarkers have all enabled the co-development of new drugs with companion diagnostics, and they illustrate the paradigm that will govern progress in oncology in the immediate future.

ImmunoPET at as early as 4 hours after injection produced high-contrast images, and ex vivo biodistribution analysis at 20 hours after injection showed about 2-fold difference in tracer uptake levels between the parental and resistant tumors (P < 0.01). Further immunoPET studies using a larger fragment, the H2 minibody (scFv-CH3 dimer), produced similar results at later time points. Two of the antibody clones (H2 and H5) showed in vitro growth inhibitory effects on MET-dependent gefitinib-resistant cell lines, whereas no effects were observed on resistant lines lacking MET activation.

Unfortunately, acquired resistance eventually emerges in these chronically treated cancers. Two of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to TKIs seen clinically are the acquisition of a secondary \"gatekeeper\" T790M EGFR mutation that increases the affinity of mutant EGFR for ATP and activation of MET to offset the loss of EGFR signaling. Although up to one-third of patient tumors resistant to reversible EGFR TKIs harbor concurrent T790M mutation and MET amplification, potential therapies for these tumors have not been modeled in vivo. In this study, we developed a preclinical platform to evaluate potential therapies by generating transgenic mouse lung cancer models expressing EGFR-mutant Del19-T790M or L858R-T790M, each with concurrent MET overexpression. We found that monotherapy targeting EGFR or MET alone did not produce significant tumor regression. In contrast, combination therapies targeting EGFR and MET simultaneously were highly efficacious against EGFR TKI-resistant tumors codriven by Del19-T790M or L858R-T790M and MET. Our findings therefore provide an in vivo model of intrinsic resistance to reversible TKIs and offer preclinical proof-of-principle that combination targeting of EGFR and MET may benefit patients with NSCLC.",

To overcome this resistance, identification of new small-molecule natural compounds is crucial for cancer therapeutics.

We now show that the extent of activation of the tyrosine kinase Src is markedly increased in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC (HCC827 GR) cells with MET amplification compared with that in the gefitinib-sensitive parental (HCC827) cells. In contrast, the extent of Src activation did not differ between gefitinib-resistant NSCLC (PC9/ZD) cells harboring the T790M mutation of EGFR and the corresponding gefitinib-sensitive parental (PC9) cells. This activation of Src in HCC827 GR cells was largely abolished by the MET-TKI PHA-665752 but was only partially inhibited by gefitinib, suggesting that Src activation is more dependent on MET signaling than on EGFR signaling in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells with MET amplification. Src inhibitors blocked Akt and Erk signaling pathways, resulting in both suppression of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, in HCC827 GR cells as effectively as did the combination of gefitinib and PHA-665752. Furthermore, Src inhibitor dasatinib inhibited tumor growth in HCC827 GR xenografts to a significantly greater extent than did treatment with gefitinib alone.

To understand their role in TKI-resistant NSCLCs, we examined changes in miRNA that are mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors.

We showed that these miRNAs have important roles in gefitinib-induced apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the expression of the genes encoding BCL2-like 11 (BIM), apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (APAF-1), protein kinase C ɛ (PKC-ɛ) and sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (SRC).

Currently, the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor gefitinib is used for its treatment; however, drug resistance is a major obstacle. Expression of Met has been associated with both primary and acquired resistance to gefitinib, but the mechanisms regulating its expression are not fully understood. Recently, miRNAs such as miR-130a have been shown to play a role in gefitinib resistance, but importance in NSCLC and relationships with Met have not been fully explored. Here we show that miR-130a is over-expressed in gefitinib- sensitive NSCLC cell lines, but is low in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, miR-130a expression was negatively correlated with that of Met. Further analysis revealed that over-expression of miR-130a increased cell apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of NSCLC cells treated with gefitinib, whereas lowering the expression of miR-130a decreased cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation after treatment with gefitinib in both gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines, suggesting that miR-130a overcomes gefitinib resistance. We also demonstrated that miR-130a binds to the 3'-UTR of Met and significantly suppresses its expression. Finally, our results showed that over-expressing Met could \"rescue\" the functions of miR-130a regarding cell apoptosis and proliferation after cells are treated with gefitinib.

Characterization of H820 cells and evaluation of NPS-1034 efficacy in these cells were also performed. The resistance of HCC827/GR was mediated by MET activation, whereas AXL activation led to resistance in HCC827/ER. The combination of gefitinib or erlotinib with NPS-1034 synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in both resistant cell lines. Accordingly, suppression of Akt was noted only in the presence of treatment with both drugs. NPS-1034 was also effective in xenograft mouse models of HCC827/GR. Although the H820 cell line was reported previously to have T790M and MET amplification, we discovered that AXL was also activated in this cell line. There were no antitumor effects of siRNA or inhibitors specific for EGFR or MET, whereas combined treatment with AXL siRNA or NPS-1034 and EGFR-TKIs controlled H820 cells, suggesting that AXL is the main signal responsible for resistance.

Alterations in MET have been observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors, with increased expression associated with more aggressive cancer, as well as acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). MET inhibitors act via two basic mechanisms. Small molecule inhibitors antagonize ATP in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of MET, with studies on the following agents reviewed here: tivantinib (ARQ-197), cabozantinib (XL-184), crizotinib (PF-02341066), amuvatinib (MP470), MGCD265, foretinib (EXEL-2880), MK2461, SGX523, PHA665752, JNJ-38877605, SU11274, and K252A. The monoclonal monovalent antibody fragment onartuzumab (MetMAb) is also discussed here, which binds to and prevents the extracellular activation of the receptor by ligand. MET inhibition may both overcome the negative prognostic effect of MET tumor expression as well as antagonize MET-dependent acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Here we discuss MET inhibitors in combination with other therapies in lung cancer. ",

However, whether or not bufalin has inhibitory activity against the proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells is unclear. The aim of this study is to study the effects of bufalin on the proliferation of NSCLC and its molecular mechanisms of action. The cancer cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein expressions and phosphorylation in the cancer cells were detected by Western blot analysis. In the present study, we have demonstrated that bufalin suppressed the proliferation of human NSCLC A549 cell line in time- and dose-dependent manners. Bufalin induced the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by affecting the protein expressions of Bcl-2/Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3, PARP, p53, p21WAF1, cyclinD1, and COX-2 in A549 cells. In addition, bufalin reduced the protein levels of receptor expressions and/or phosphorylation of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, EGFR and/or c-Met in A549 cells. Furthermore, bufalin inhibited the protein expressions and phosphorylation of Akt, NF-κB, p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK in A549 cells. Our results suggest that bufalin inhibits the human lung cancer cell proliferation via VEGFR1/VEGFR2/EGFR/c-Met-Akt/p44/42/p38-NF-κB signaling pathways; bufalin may have a wide therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic application in the treatment of human NSCLC.",

Ephedrae herba was previously reported to prevent HGF-induced cancer cell motility by directly suppressing HGF/MET signaling through the inhibition of MET tyrosine kinase, and treatment with its extract also considerably reduced MET protein levels. To further investigate the mechanism underlying the Ephedrae herba-induced inhibition of MET phosphorylation as well as its degradation and subsequent disappearance, we examined the effect of Ephedrae herba on HGF-stimulated MET endocytosis and downregulation via early/late endocytic pathways in an NSCLC cell line. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that pretreatment of cells with Ephedrae herba extract dramatically changed the intracellular distribution of plasma membrane-associated MET, and that the resultant MET staining was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Pretreatment of the cells with Ephedrae herba extract also led to the rapid loss of MET and phosphorylated (p)-MET in HGF-stimulated cells. In contrast, inefficient endocytic delivery of MET and p-MET from early to late endosomes was observed in the absence of Ephedrae herba extract, since considerable amounts of the internalized MET accumulated in the early endosomes and were not delivered to lysosomes up to 1 h after HGF-stimulation. Furthermore, large amounts of MET and p-MET that had accumulated in late endosomes of Ephedrae herba-pretreated cells after HGF stimulation were observed along with bafilomycin A1. Therefore, we inferred that degradation of MET occurred in the late endosome/lysosome pathway. Moreover, western blot analysis revealed the accelerated degradation of MET and p-MET proceeds in cells pretreated with Ephedrae herba extract. Collectively, our results suggest that some components of Ephedrae herba have a novel role in promoting HGF-stimulated MET and p-MET endocytosis followed by its downregulation, likely mediated by the early/late endocytic pathways.",

However, phase I clinical trial of 2-dDG demonstrated cardiac side effects at higher dosage. Metformin (Met), on the other hand, has been reported to improve pathological response to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we propose that combination therapy of 2-dDG with Met will demonstrate enhanced cytotoxicity than either compound alone. Our results indicated that inhibition concentration 25 (IC25) for combined treatment of Met and 2-dDG showed more toxicity as compared to individual agents on a NSCLC cell line, A549. This augmented toxicity is associated with increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione level as well as decreased super oxide dismutase and catalase activities. Combination of Met and 2-dDG also demonstrated enhanced DNA damage, DNA adduct formation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and mitochondrial membrane potential alteration, as well as increased apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, P-p38 and P-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) level. It was also shown that inhibition of caspase-3 and p38 kinase partially (75%-87%) reversed Met and 2-dDG induced cell death, without affecting the ROS levels. On the other hand, pre-treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reversed Met and 2-dDG induced cell death to >90%. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated that combination of Met and 2-dDG showed better toxicity than individual compounds and cell death is ROS, P-p38 and caspase-3 mediated, thereby providing a proof of concept for the combination of Met and 2-dDG as a potential treatment protocol for NSCLC.",

The identification of these oncogenic drivers has led to the design of rationally targeted therapies that have produced superior clinical outcomes in tumours harbouring these mutations. Many patients, however, have de novo or acquired resistance to these therapies. In addition, most NSCLCs are genetically complex tumours harbouring multiple potential activating events. For these patients, disease subsets are likely to be defined by combination strategies involving a number of targeted agents. These targets include FGFR1, PTEN, MET, MEK, PD-1/PD-L1, and NaPi2b. In light of the myriad new biomarkers and targeted agents, multiplex testing strategies will be invaluable in identifying the appropriate patients for each therapy and enabling targeted agents to be channelled to the patients most likely to gain benefit.

The present study was intended to investigate the in vivo anti-tumour activity of MTE combined with gefitinib.;Human NSCLC H460 (K-ras mutation) or H1975 cells (EGFR T790M mutation) were subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice. Tumour volume and body weight were measured regularly. Resected tumours were weighed after the animals were sacrificed. Immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry was used to assess the cellular proliferation and apoptosis in xenograft tumour tissue. Expression of the EGFR downstream pathways and c-Met were measured with western blot analysis to explore possible mechanisms.;MTE (5, 10, 20 g/kg) dose-dependently reduced tumour growth and induced cell apoptosis. MTE suppressed EGFR related signals, and 20 g/kg was the most effective dose. Low-dose MTE (5 g/kg) significantly enhanced gefitinib efficacy in resistant H460 and H1975 xenografts. The combination inhibited tumour proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in both resistant NSCLC xenografts. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways is related to EGFR-TKI resistance. Accordingly, phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 was suppressed after combination treatment. Simultaneously, cross-talked c-Met and EGFR were also prominently lowered in the presence of MTE combined with gefitinib.;The present results suggest that the combination of MTE and gefitinib may be a promising therapeutic approach to enhance gefitinib efficacy in resistant NSCLC.",

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation and MET aberrations occur in a subset of NSCLC. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase/MET have been shown to be inhibited by the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib. Recently, crizotinib was shown to decrease testosterone in males. Herein, we describe the effects of crizotinib on multiple hormonal axes.;Seven consecutive patients with NSCLC who were receiving crizotinib as part of their standard care were evaluated for hormonal disruptions.;Primary hypogonadism was detected in 4/5 of males, whereas mildly elevated prolactin was observed in 4/7 patients. Hypocalcemia was observed in 3/7 patients. Interestingly, 5/7 patients had elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, and the remaining 2 individuals had levels that were near the upper limits of the normal range.;Because of cellular cross-talk between MET and IGF-1 signaling, elevated IGF-1 levels induced by crizotinib treatment may have implications for long-term drug efficacy. Furthermore, this finding suggests a potential avenue of therapeutic synergy, namely coordinate inhibition of the MET and IGF-1 signaling pathways. Finally, as crizotinib has been recently approved, it is prudent to check hormone and calcium biomarkers and correct noted deficiencies for improved outcomes and quality of life.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality world-wide. Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a particularly aggressive cancer, the optimum management of which is still being determined. In the next years modest survival improvement can be expected by chemotherapy. Advances in understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer have led to the identification of several specific targets for therapeutic agents. Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has played a central role in advancing NSCLC research, treatment, and patient outcome over the last several years. In lung cancer, 10-15% of NSCLC contain activating mutations in the EGFR kinase conferring hypersensitivity to the oral TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib, have been demonstrated to be important predictive factors when selecting patients to be treated with these two agents. More recently, another molecular abnormality, the translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene that drives NSCLC in a different group of patients has been found in 4 to 5% of NSCLC. The rearrangement results in an EML4 - AKL fusion gene, which increases ALK activity. Inhibitors of ALK kinase have been developed and investigated. Crizotinib, an orally ALK and met proto-oncogene (MET) inhibitor, was very well tolerated and produced dramatic antitumor activity in early-stage trials which facilitated a faster than normal move into late-stage trials for EML4-ALK -positive NSCLC patients treatment. In a phase III randomized that showed progression free survival benefit as compared to chemotherapy in second-line setting. Several novel selective inhibitors of ALK kinase are currently in preclinical or early clinical testing. Since the discovery that Met pathway is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in human cancer, Met inhibitors, with varying kinase selectivity profiles ranging from highly selective to multi-targeted have been studied in the clinic and good progress has been achieved. A number of studies suggest that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is central to NSCLC growth and survival. Given the importance of activated PI3K signaling in cancer, several PI3K inhibitors are currently one of the most recent drug targets in oncology, with several small molecules in early stages of clinical development. This review will focus on the role of EGFR, ALK, MET, and PI3K inhibitors in the treatment of NSCLC. ",

However, the efficacy of BEV+ERL against EGFR-mutated NSCLC harboring T790M mutation or MET amplification, is unclear. Here, we examined the antitumor activity of BEV+ERL in four xenograft models of EGFR-mutated NSCLC (three harboring ERL resistance mutations). In the HCC827 models (exon 19 deletion: DEL), ERL significantly inhibited tumor growth by blocking EGFR signal transduction. Although there was no difference between ERL and BEV+ERL in maximum tumor growth inhibition, BEV+ERL significantly suppressed tumor regrowth during a drug-cessation period. In the HCC827-EPR model (DEL+T790M) and HCC827-vTR model (DEL+MET amplification), ERL reduced EGFR signal transduction and showed less pronounced but still significant tumor growth inhibition than in the HCC827 model. In these models, tumor growth inhibition was significantly stronger with BEV+ERL than with each single agent. In the NCI-H1975 model (L858R+T790M), ERL did not inhibit growth or EGFR signal transduction, and BEV+ERL did not inhibit growth more than BEV. BEV alone significantly decreased microvessel density in each tumor. In conclusion, addition of BEV to ERL did not enhance antitumor activity in primarily ERL-resistant tumors with T790M mutation; however, BEV+ERL enhanced antitumor activity in T790M mutation- or MET amplification-positive tumors as long as their growth remained significantly suppressed by ERL.",

At present, secondary resistance mechanisms associated with progression are better known: clonal selection of EGFR resistance mutation (T790M mutation in exon 20), amplification of transmembrane receptors for other growth factors (c-met, HER family, IGF1R, or AXL), downstream molecular alterations in EGFR signaling pathway (PI3K or PTEN), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition or transdifferentiation to small-cell cancer.

Studying molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis, tumour recurrence and therapy resistance of lung cancer will help us to further understand the pathogenesis and progression of the disease and offer new targets for effective therapies. In the present study, we found that miR-520a-3p expression is downregulated in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) and SCLC (small cell lung cancer). miR-520a-3p can inhibit proliferation and cancer stem cell phenotype in NSCLC and SCLC cells. Overexpressing miR-520a-3p can degrade HOXD8 mRNA in NSCLC cells, but its overexpression cannot suppress HOXD8 in SCLC cells. HOXD8 protein is upregulated in NSCLC tissues and its overexpression can promote proliferation, formation of cancer stem cells, migration and invasion in NSCLC cells. MET amplification plays a pivotal role in gefitinib resistance in lung cancer. We found that miR-520a-3p can downregulate MET protein expression and HOXD8 can upregulate MET protein expression. Thus, we concluded that microRNA-520a-3p inhibits proliferation and cancer stem cell phenotype by targeting HOXD8 in NSCLC cells and restoration of microRNA-520a-3p might be a therapeutic strategy to reverse gefitinib resistance.",

Increased MET copy number is the most frequent rociletinib resistance mechanism in this cohort and patients with multiple pre-existing mechanisms (T790M and MET) experience inferior responses. Similarly, rociletinib-resistant xenografts develop MET amplification that can be overcome with the MET inhibitor crizotinib.

TaqMan RT-PCR was used to evaluate the SNPs of the XRCC3 codon241 (Thr/Met) and XPD codon751 (Lys/Gln) DNA repair genes.;There was a lack of association between the studied SNPs and the response rate, progression-free survival or overall survival (OS) in the whole population. However, subgroup analysis revealed that XRCC3 241 Thr/Met or Met/Met allele was associated with marginally significantly longer OS than XRCC3 Thr/Thr allele (19.0 m vs. 12.5 m, p=0.081) in the patients treated with gemcitabine/ cisplatin or carboplatin (GP/GC) while it was correlated with a significantly shorter OS in the patients treated with non GP/GC (9.3 m vs. 16 m, p=0.003). XPD751 Lys/Lys had an association with statistical significantly longer OS than XPD751 Lys/Gln or Gln/Gln in the subgroup of elderly patients (14.10 m vs. 10 m, p=0.019) and patients with non-adenocarcinoma (12.6 m vs. 9 m, p=0.042).;XRCC3 Thr241Met played an opposite role in predicting prognosis of chemotherapy in NSCLC patients according to the first-line regimens.

This study aims to comprehensively and quantitatively asses the suitability of MET GCN and protein expression to predict patients' survival.;PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for articles comparing overall survival in patients with high MET GCN or protein expression with those with low level. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random and the fixed-effects models. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.;Eighteen eligible studies enrolling 5,516 patients were identified. Pooled analyses revealed that high MET GCN or protein expression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (GCN: HR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.35-2.68, p<0.001; protein expression: HR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.08-2.15, p = 0.017).

Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) metabolizes AEA and decreases its anti-tumorigenic activity. In this study, we have analyzed the role of FAAH inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have shown that FAAH and CB1 receptor which is activated by AEA are expressed in lung adenocarcinoma patient samples and NSCLC cell lines A549 and H460. Since the synthetic analogue of anandamide (Met-F-AEA) did not possess significant anti-tumorigenic effects, we used Met-F-AEA in combination with FAAH inhibitor URB597 which significantly reduced EGF (epidermal growth factor)-induced proliferative and chemotactic activities in vitro when compared to anti-tumorigenic activity of Met-F-AEA alone. Further analysis of signaling mechanisms revealed that Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 inhibits activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling ERK, AKT and NF-kB. In addition, it inhibited MMP2 secretion and stress fiber formation. We have also shown that the Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by downregulating cyclin D1 and CDK4 expressions, ultimately leading to apoptosis via activation of caspase-9 and PARP. Furthermore, the combination treatment inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft nude mouse model system. Tumors derived from Met-F-AEA and URB597 combination treated mice showed reduced EGFR, AKT and ERK activation and MMP2/MMP9 expressions when compared to Met-F-AEA or URB597 alone. Taken together, these data suggest in EGFR overexpressing NSCLC that the combination of Met-F-AEA with FAAH inhibitor resulted in superior therapeutic response compared to individual compound activity alone.

So far, development of a secondary T790M mutation represents the most common (approximately 60%) mechanism of resistance to these drugs. The relative rarity of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) amplification in NSCLC suggests that this event plays a limited role in primary resistance to EGFR-TKI. In contrast, MET gene amplification has been detected as a secondary event representing one of the most relevant mechanisms involved in the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs both in preclinical and clinical studies. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of MET amplification as a mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies and to review strategies which aim at overcoming this mechanism of resistance, including studies assessing drug combinations targeting both EGFR and MET pathways.

All patients received a two-drug platinum-based regimen (median of 2.5 cycles [2-4 cycles]) and 15 (21%) had an associated radiotherapy (20-40 Gy). Nine complete and 27 partial responses were achieved. Surgical procedure principally was a lobectomy (44%), a left (15.5%) or a right (27%) pneumonectomy. Operative mortality was 4.2% while 21 patients (29%) experienced postoperative complications. Median survival was 17 months (95% CI, 13-21 months) with 3- and 5-year survival rates of 24 and 13%, respectively.

Anti-EGFR agents, including EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors are considered to be effective when a drug-sensitive EGFR mutation is present. However, inherent and acquired resistances are major problems of EGFR-targeting therapies. In this study, we performed EGFR knockdown by using small interfering RNAs in NSCLC cell lines to examine the significance of targeting EGFR for NSCLC therapy.;We treated 13 NSCLC cell lines, including 8 EGFR mutant and 5 EGFR wild type by using gefitinib or small interfering RNAs against EGFR (siEGFR). Three cell lines (PC-9-GR1, RPC-9, and HCC827-ER) were experimentally established with acquired resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The antitumor effect was determined by using an 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) or colony formation assay. The protein expression was evaluated by using Western blotting.;All 13 cell lines expressed EGFR protein, and siEGFR downregulated EGFR protein expression in all. The cell viability was suppressed by siEGFR in 6 of 8 EGFR-mutant cell lines (suppressed 57%-92% of control cells), including PC-9-GR1 and RPC-9. The NCI-H1650 and HCC827-ER harbored EGFR mutations but were not suppressed. Of note, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) was deleted in NCI-H1650, and c-MET was amplified in HCC827-ER. It was not suppressed in any of the EGFR wild-type cells except in the NCI-H411, in which EGFR is phosphorylated, which indicates its activation.;Analysis of the results indicated that EGFR can be a therapeutic target in NSCLCs with EGFR activation. In contrast, targeting EGFR is not appropriate for tumors in which EGFR is not activated, even if EGFR is expressed.",

We aimed to establish an extensive well-characterized panel of NSCLC xenograft models in the context of a long-distance research network after careful control of the preanalytical steps. One hundred fresh surgically resected NSCLC specimens were shipped in survival medium at room temperature from a hospital-integrated biobank to animal facilities. Within 24 h post-surgery, tumor fragments were subcutaneously xenografted into immunodeficient mice. PDX characterization was performed by histopathological, immunohistochemical, aCGH and next-generation sequencing approaches. For this model system, the tumor take rate was 35%, with higher rates for squamous carcinoma (60%) than for adenocarcinoma (13%). Patients for whom PDX tumors were obtained had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients for whom no PDX tumors (P = 0.039) were obtained. We established a large panel of PDX NSCLC models with a high frequency of mutations (29%) in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MEK1, BRAF, PTEN, and PI3KCA genes and with gene amplification (20%) of c-MET and FGFR1.

The quality of the studies was assessed via the validated Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument.;Nineteen studies (including update) involving the MoAb bevacizumab and the Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib met all inclusion criteria. The majority of studies analyzed the CE of first-line maintenance and second-line treatment with erlotinib. Five studies dealt with bevacizumab in first-line regimes. Gefitinib and pharmacogenomic profiling were each covered by only two studies. Furthermore, the available evidence was of only fair quality.;First-line maintenance treatment with erlotinib compared to Best Supportive Care (BSC) can be considered cost-effective. In comparison to docetaxel, erlotinib is likely to be cost-effective in subsequent treatment regimens as well. The insights for bevacizumab are miscellaneous. There are findings that gefitinib is cost-effective in first- and second-line treatment, however, based on only two studies. The role of pharmacogenomic testing needs to be evaluated.

Long thought to be nonimmunogenic, immunotherapy in lung cancer has historically been met with disappointing results. Programmed death-1 (PD-1), and the PD-1 ligand, PD-L1, are immune checkpoint proteins that fine-tune the antigen-specific T-cell response after stimulation of the T-cell receptor and are crucial for self-tolerance. This pathway in particular is co-opted by tumors through expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface and within the tumor microenvironment, allowing for direct suppression of antitumor cytolytic T-cell activity by the tumor. Indeed, induction of the PD1/PD-L1 pathway represents an adaptive immune resistance mechanism exerted by tumor cells in response to endogenous antitumor activity. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two immuno-oncology agents, the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab, for the treatment of previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Coincident with the clinical trials that led to these regulatory approvals has been the development of several immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests of PD-L1 expression, which may serve to select patients who will derive the most benefit from PD1- or PD-L1-directed therapy.

Recent advances in the detection of genetic alterations in patient samples along with physiologically relevant animal models has yielded a new understanding of the molecular etiology of lung cancer. This has facilitated the development of potent and specific targeted therapies, based on the genetic and biochemical alterations present in the tumor, especially non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is now clear that heterogeneous cell signaling pathways are disrupted to promote NSCLC, including mutations in critical growth regulatory proteins (K-Ras, EGFR, B-RAF, MEK-1, HER2, MET, EML-4-ALK, KIF5B-RET, and NKX2.1) and inactivation of growth inhibitory pathways (TP53, PTEN, p16, and LKB-1). How these pathways differ between smokers and non-smokers is also important for clinical treatment strategies and development of targeted therapies. This paper describes these molecular targets in NSCLC, and describes the biological significance of each mutation and their potential to act as a therapeutic target.",

Recent genomic studies in lung adenocarcinoma identified other potential therapeutic targets, including ROS1 rearrangements, RET fusions, MET amplification, and activating mutations in BRAF, HER2, and KRAS in frequencies exceeding 1%. Lung cancers that harbor these genomic changes can potentially be targeted with agents approved for other indications or under clinical development. The need to generate increasing amounts of genomic information should prompt health-care providers to be mindful of the amounts of tissue needed for these assays when planning diagnostic procedures.

Gefitinib (Iressa) has demonstrated clinical efficacy in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations or refractory to chemotherapy. However, most of NSCLC patients are with wild type EGFR, and showed limited response to gefitinib. Therefore, to develop new effective therapeutic interventions for NSCLC is still required. Our previous study showed Marsdenia tenacissima extract (MTE) restored gefitinib efficacy in the resistant NSCLC cells, but whether MTE acts in the gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cells is the same as it in the resistant one is unknown.;Dose response curves for gefitinib and MTE were generated for two sensitive NSCLC cell lines with mutant or wild type EGFR status. Three different sequential combinations of MTE and gefitinib on cell growth were evaluated using IC50 and Combination Index approaches. The flow cytometric method was used to detect cell apoptosis and cell cycle profile. The impact of MTE combined with gefitinib on cell molecular network response was studied by Western blotting.;Unlike in the resistant NSCLC cells, our results revealed that low cytotoxic dose of MTE (8 mg/ml) combined gefitinib with three different schedules synergistically or additively enhanced the growth inhibition of gefitinib. Among which, MTE→MTE+gefitinib treatment was the most effective one. MTE markedly prompted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis caused by gefitinib both in EGFR mutant (HCC827) and wild type of NSCLC cells (H292). The Western blotting results showed that MTE→MTE+gefitinib treatment further enhanced the suppression of gefitinib on cell growth and apoptosis pathway such as ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR. This combination also blocked the activation of EGFR and c-Met which have cross-talk with each other. Unlike in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells, MTE alone also demonstrated certain unexpected modulation on EGFR related cell signal pathways in the sensitive cells.;Our results suggest that MTE is a promising herbal medicine to improve gefitinib efficacy in NSCLC regardless of EGFR status. However, why MTE acted differently between gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells needs a further research.",

In addition, the anti-tumor activity of gefitinib was potentiated via curcumin through blocking EGFR activation and inducing apoptosis in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines; also the combined treatment with curcumin and gefitinib exhibited significant inhibition in the CL1-5, A549 and H1975 xenografts tumor growth in SCID mice through reducing EGFR, c-MET, cyclin D1 expression, and inducing apoptosis activation through caspases-8, 9 and PARP.

The EGFR-T790M secondary mutation is responsible for half of acquired resistance cases, while MET amplification has been associated with acquired resistance in about 5-15% of NSCLCs. Clinical findings indicate the retained addiction of resistant tumors on EGFR signaling. Therefore, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms supporting the therapeutic potential of gefitinib maintenance in the HCC827 GR5 NSCLC cell line harbouring MET amplification as acquired resistance mechanism. We demonstrated that resistant cells can proliferate and survive regardless of the presence of gefitinib, whereas the absence of the drug significantly enhanced cell migration and invasion. Moreover, the continuous exposure to gefitinib prevented the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with increased E-cadherin expression and down-regulation of vimentin and N-cadherin. Importantly, the inhibition of cellular migration was correlated with the suppression of EGFR-dependent Src, STAT5 and p38 signaling as assessed by a specific kinase array, western blot analysis and silencing functional studies. On the contrary, the lack of effect of gefitinib on EGFR phosphorylation in the H1975 cells (EGFR-T790M) correlated with the absence of effects on cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that certain EGFR-mutated patients may still benefit from a second-line therapy including gefitinib based on the specific mechanism underlying tumor cell resistance.

Moreover, treatment with a USP8 inhibitor led to significant reductions in tumor size in a mouse xenograft model using gefitinib-resistant and -sensitive NSCLC cells.;Our results show for the first time that the inhibition of USP8 activity or reduction in USP8 expression can selectively kill NSCLC cells. We propose USP8 as a potential therapeutic target for gefitinib-resistant and -sensitive NSCLC cells.",

Mutational analysis for EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and intron-exon 14 deletions of MET; FISH analysis for chromosomal gain or amplification for EGFR, MET and the deletion marker D7S486 were performed. Furthermore, the expression of EGFR and MET were analysed by immunohistochemistry.

EGFR and RAS mutational rates were 33% and 10% respectively, no other mutations were identified. High EGFR expressing tumors were found in 7 of 45 cases and pEGFR positivity (IHC) was found in 56% of the cases; MET expression was found in 48% of tumors. EGFR gene amplification was found in 4 cases, two cases showed high polysomy; overall, 13% cases were FISH positive for EGFR. High polysomy of MET gene was detected in 1/43 cases tested.

In HCC827-GR cells, inhibition of SMO or downregulation of GLI1 (the most important Hh-induced transcription factor) expression in combination with MET inhibition exerted significant antitumor activity.In EGFR-WT NSCLC cell lines resistant to EGFR inhibitors, the combined inhibition of SMO and EGFR exerted a strong antiproliferative activity with a complete inhibition of PI3K/Akt and MAPK phosphorylation. In addition, the inhibition of SMO by the use of LDE225 sensitizes EGFR-WT NSCLC cells to standard chemotherapy.;This result supports the role of the Hh pathway in mediating resistance to anti-EGFR-TKIs through the induction of EMT and suggests new opportunities to design new treatment strategies in lung cancer.",

Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib). Notably, increasing feasibility, accessibility, and application of molecular profiling technologies has permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes. Emerging genomic aberrations for which TKIs have shown impressive results in clinical trials and expansion of drug labels for approved agents are awaited include ROS1 rearrangements (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib) and BRAF-V600E mutations (1-3% of tumors, drugs: vemurafenib, dafrafenib + trametinib). Evolving genomic events in which TKI responses have been reported in smaller series include MET exon 14 skipping mutations (2-4% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); high-level MET amplification (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); RET rearrangements (1% of tumors, drug: cabozantinib); and ERBB2 mutations (2-3% of tumors, drug: afatinib), among others. Unfortunately, the most common genomic event in NSCLC, KRAS mutations (25-30% of tumors), is not targetable with approved or in development small molecule inhibitors.

        "Doc_abstract":"The incorporation of individualized molecular therapeutics into routine clinical practice for both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma are amongst the most significant advances of the last decades in medical oncology. In NSCLC activating somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene have been found to be predictive of a response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib or gefitinib. More recently the EML4-ALK fusion gene which occurs in 3-5% of NSCLC has been found to predict sensitivity to crizotinib an inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase. Similarly in melanoma, 50% of cases have BRAF mutations in exon 15 mostly V600E and these cases are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib. In a Phase III study of advanced melanoma cases with this mutation vemurafenib improved survival from 64% to 84% at 6 months, when compared with dacarbazine. In both NSCLC and melanoma clinical benefit is not obtained in patients without these genomic changes, and moreover in the case of vemurafenib the therapy may theoretically induce proliferation of cases of melanoma without BRAF mutations. An emerging clinical challenge is that of acquired resistance after initial responses to targeted therapeutics. Resistance to the TKI's in NSCLC is most frequently due to acquisition of secondary mutations within the tyrosine kinase of the EGFR or alternatively activation of alternative tyrosine kinases such as C-MET. Mechanisms of drug resistance in melanoma to vemurafenib do not involve mutations in BRAF itself but are associated with a variety of molecular changes including RAF1 or COT gene over expression, activating mutations in RAS or increased activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFRβ. Importantly these data support introducing re-biopsy of tumors at progression to continue to personalize the choice of therapy throughout the patient's disease course. ",

EGFR mutations are found in about 10% of lung cancers, especially in adenocarcinoma, women and non-smokers. Three EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib) received a European marketing authorization for up to first line treatment of EGFR mutated NSCLC. Effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors is higher than conventional chemotherapy. Third generation EGFR inhibitors (rociletinib, AZD9291) are effective for patients who develop a resistance mutation such as T790M resistance mutation; they obtained temporary authorization for use in France in 2015. The EML4-ALK translocation is found in about 5% of NSCLC and more particularly in adenocarcinoma of young non-smoking patients. Crizotinib is a new therapeutic standard in ALK translocated NSCLC in second line. Ceritinib is a 2nd generation ALK inhibitor which received a European marketing authorization for up to treatment of ALK translocated NSCLC after progression with crizotinib. INCA supports ACSé program evaluating the efficacy of crizotinib in NSCLC amplified for MET or translocated for ROS1 and ACSé program evaluating the efficacy of vemurafenib in tumors non melanoma mutated V600E BRAF. The role of other biomarkers such as KRAS, BRAF, HER2 and PI3KCA mutations remains to be defined in NSCLC. ",

The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay was validated for use with FFPE NSCLC and HNSCC tissue samples in a series of studies addressing sensitivity, specificity, robustness, and precision. Samples from a subset of 181 patients from a Phase 1/2 study of durvalumab (NCT01693562) were analyzed to determine the optimal PD-L1 staining cut-off for enriching the probability of responses to treatment. The scoring algorithm was defined using statistical analysis of clinical response data from this clinical trial and PD-L1 staining parameters in HNSCC and NSCLC tissue. Inter-reader agreement was established by three pathologists who evaluated 81 NSCLC and 100 HNSCC samples across the range of PD-L1 expression levels.;The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay met all pre-defined acceptance criteria. For both cancer types, a cut-off of 25 % of tumor cells with PD-L1 membrane staining of any intensity best discriminated responders from nonresponders. Samples with staining above this value were deemed to have high PD-L1 expression, and those with staining below it were deemed to have low or no PD-L1 expression. Inter-reader agreement on PD-L1 status was 97 and 92 % for NSCLC and HNSCC, respectively.;These results highlight the robustness and reproducibility of the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay and support its suitability for use in the evaluation of NSCLC and HNSCC FFPE tumor samples using the devised ≥25 % tumor cell staining cut-off in a clinical setting.

EGFR and AKT are client proteins of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90). Therefore, it was hypothesized that the use of Hsp90 inhibitors might allow the resistance to EGFR-TKIs to be overcome. Furthermore, Hsp90 inhibitors are known to function as radiosensitizers in various types of cancer. In the present study, we evaluated the radiosensitizing effect of the novel Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922 (AUY), on NSCLC cell lines harboring EGFR activating mutations and showing acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs via any of several mechanisms. We used HCC827 and PC-9, which are NSCLC cell lines harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions, and gefitinib-resistant sublines derived from the same cell lines with T790M mutation, MET amplification or stem-cell like properties. AUY was more effective against the gefitinib-resistant sublines with T790M mutation and MET amplification than against the parental cell lines, although the subline with stem cell-like properties showed more than a 10-fold higher resistance to AUY than the parental cell line. AUY exerted a significant radiosensitizing effect on the parental cell line and the MET-amplified subline through inducing G2/M arrest and inhibition of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In contrast, the radiosensitizing effect of AUY was limited on the subline with stem cell-like properties, in which it did not induce G2/M arrest or inhibition of NHEJ. In conclusion, combined inhibition of Hsp90 plus radiation was effective, and therefore a promising treatment alternative for overcoming major EGFR-TKI resistance, such as that induced by T790M mutation or MET amplification. However, other approaches are required to overcome minor resistance to EGFR-TKIs, such as that observed in cells with stem cell-like properties.",

Although patients with EGFR-activating mutations respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), they eventually acquire resistance, which typically results from a secondary EGFR mutation or the activation of other signaling pathways. Novel approaches to overcome or prevent EGFR-TKI resistance are clinically important. In this study, we developed an EGFR-scFv-arginine nonamer peptide fusion protein, s-9R, as an siRNA carrier. Here, we show that s-9R effectively and specifically delivers EGFR-siRNAs, KRAS-siRNA and MET-siRNA into NSCLC cells and silences the expression of target genes. The sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib was restored after treatment with the s-9R/siRNA complex, and the apoptosis rates of the treated cells were significantly higher than those of the control groups. Furthermore, the co-administration of s-9R/siRNA and gefitinib successfully suppressed the progression of H1975 xenograft tumors and extended the life span of tumor-bearing nude mice. Collectively, the results of this study provide not only a new scFv derivative for delivering siRNA into EGFR-overexpressing, TKI-resistant NSCLC cells but also a novel method for overcoming TKI resistance.

Cancer cell dormancy is the main cause of cancer recurrence and failure of therapy. However, cancer dormancy is poorly characterized and the mechanisms of how cancer cells develop dormancy and relapse remain elusive. In this study, 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) was used to induce cancer cell dormancy. We found that cancer cells escape the cytotoxicity of 5-FU by becoming \"dormant\". After exposure to 5-FU, residual non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), followed by mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). These EMT-transformed NSCLC cells were in the state of cell quiescence where cells were not dividing and were arrested in the cell cycle in G0-G1. The dormant cells underwent an EMT showed characteristics of cancer stem cells. P53 is strongly accumulated in response to 5-FU-induced dormant cells through the activation of ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and TGF-β/Smad signaling. In contrast to the EMT-transformed cells, MET-transformed cells showed an increased ability to proliferate, suggesting that dormant EMT cells were reactivated in the MET process. During the EMT-MET process, DNA repair including nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) is critical to dormant cell reactivation. Our findings provide a mechanism to unravel cancer cell dormancy and reactivation of the cancer cell population. ",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are promising molecular markers in multiple cancers and show differences in expression depending on histological subtype. The miRNA family miR-200 has been associated with the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal (EMT)/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). EMT involves profound phenotypic changes that include the loss of cell-cell adhesion, the loss of cell polarity, and the acquisition of migratory and invasive properties that facilitates metastasis. A dual role for the miR-200 family in the prognosis of several tumors has been related to tumor cell origin. However, the prognostic role and function of miR-200 family in early-stage NSCLC adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have not been well established.;miRNA expression was determined using TaqMan assays in 155 tumors from resected NSCLC patients. Functional studies were conducted in three NSCLC cell lines: H23, A-549 and HCC-44.;High miR-200c expression was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in the entire cohort (p = 0.024). High miR-200c (p = 0.0004) and miR-141 (p = 0.009) expression correlated with shorter OS in adenocarcinoma - but not in SCC.

Currently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent the standard of care for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations. Subsequently other genetic abnormalities with \"driver\" characteristics - implying transforming and tumor maintenance capabilities have been extensively reported in several small distinct subsets of NSCLC. Among these rare genetic changes, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements, most often consisting in a chromosome 2 inversion leading to a fusion with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) gene, results in the abnormal expression and activation of this tyrosine kinase in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. This rearrangement occurs in 2-5% of NSCLC, predominantly in young (50 years or younger), never- or former-smokers with adenocarcinoma. This aberration most commonly occurs a independently of EGFR and KRAS gene mutations. A fluorescent in situ hybridization assay was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the standard method for the detection of ALK gene rearrangement in clinical practice and is considered the gold standard. Crizotinib, a first-in-class dual ALK and c-MET inhibitor, has been shown to be particularly effective against ALK positive NSCLC, showing dramatic and prolonged responses with low toxicity, predominantly restricted to the gastro-intestinal and visual systems, and generally self-limiting or easily managed. However, resistance to crizotinib inevitably emerges. The molecular mechanisms of resistance are currently under investigation, as are therapeutic approaches including crizotinib-based combination therapy and novel agents such as Hsp90 inhibitors. This review aims to present the current knowledge on this fusion gene, the clinic-pathological profile of ALK rearranged NSCLC, and to review the existing literature on ALK inhibitors, focusing on their role in the treatment of NSCLC.",

Data were collected from ASCO abstracts of Phase II-IV clinical trials for patients with metastatic NSCLC from 2004-2014. 770 of 2,989 identified metastatic NSCLC category abstracts met selection criteria. Despite a decline in the number of abstracts from 107 to 46 abstracts annually over this period, the proportion of trials with positive progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes has increased significantly. Trials with histology selection (6%) or molecular biomarker (15%) criteria were more likely to result in an improvement in PFS than those without selection criteria (21% vs. 8%, p = 0.0001 and 31% vs. 10%, p < 0.0001, respectively). These data demonstrate profound changes in the clinical trial landscape over the last 10 years with significantly increasing proportion of trials with positive outcomes.

Emerging protein kinase inhibitors may enhance our ability to effectively treat these and other genomic subtypes of NSCLC.;This article reviews the next-generation kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR and ALK-positive NSCLC.

Next-generation ALK inhibitors appear to have greater potency than crizotinib and several ongoing trials may shed light on their role in both ALK- and ROS1-positive NSCLC.

The primary biochemical mechanism of crizotinib is to inhibit ALK expression, leading to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Crizotinib is metabolized and excreted after O-dealkylation by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4/5; as crizotinib is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, its use entails a high potential for drug interactions, including confirmed interactions with ketoconazole and rifampin that can alter crizotinib pharmacokinetics. A Phase I trial involving patients with ALK gene mutation-positive NSCLC demonstrated significant disease control with oral crizotinib use, including an overall eight-week response rate of 87% and an estimated six-month survival of 72%. At the standard dosage of 250 mg twice daily, crizotinib is well tolerated. In clinical trials to date, the most common grade 1 or 2 adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and visual disturbances; more severe toxicities included transaminase elevations (less than 7% of patients) and pneumonitis (less than 2% of patients).

With CRT, involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) is replacing elective nodal irradiation, reducing toxicity, and allowing dose escalation. However, prior reports of IFRT describe failures only after radical CRT; with improved local control after resection, IFRT may lead to more regional recurrences. Our objective is to evaluate pattern-of-failure in patients with LA-NSCLC treated with split-course IFRT, chemotherapy, and subsequent surgery.;Patients treated between December 2004 and 2010 were included. Imaging scans demonstrating failure were fused into the radiation therapy planning computed tomography, and recurrent nodes were contoured to determine pattern-of-failure (involved versus elective nodal failure [INF vs ENF]). Locoregional progression-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The cumulative incidence of regional recurrence (CIRR) was determined with death as a competing risk.;Forty-five patients met inclusion criteria, and patients with RR had a lower rate of pN0 than those without RR (20% vs 60%, P = .02). With a median follow-up of 2.9 years, median survival was not reached, and 3-year locoregional progression-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival were 53% and 35%, respectively. Two and 3-year CIRR were 25% and 33%, respectively. There were no local failures. Thirteen (29%) patients had RR, 8 with INF only and 5 with ENF alone or both, totaling 27 recurrences. Only 2 (4%) ENF occurred without INF, both with distant metastasis, and no elective node was the first and only site of failure.;Our data suggest that IFRT does not compromise regional control in the neoadjuvant management of LA-NSCLC. Tailoring nodal volumes may improve treatment-related morbidity and allow for dose intensification of involved nodes. Further research is necessary to improve regional and distant control.",

As recently as 15 years ago, best supportive care (BSC) was considered an acceptable option for most patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, based on the concern that toxic effects of systemic chemotherapy overshadowed any potential benefits. The enhanced efficacy of platinum-based doublet chemotherapeutic regimens led to increases in overall patient survival relative to BSC. However, overall survival (OS) appeared to plateau, even with the introduction and refinement of these regimens. The addition of novel targeted agents targeting growth pathways to platinum-based regimens failed to overcome the 7.8- to 10.5-month survival barrier. After many phase III clinical trials, which involved tyrosine kinase inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, and retinoids, this survival barrier had yet to be surmounted, although in some cases certain subgroups benefited, suggesting specific molecular correlations. Recently, inhibition of components of the angiogenesis pathway with the addition of bevacizumab to a platinum-based doublet led to statistically significant increases in OS, progression-free survival, and response rate relative to chemotherapy alone. This advance pushed the median survival of selected patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who met the eligibility criteria of the trial over the 12-month mark, thus offering patients and clinicians hope for more incremental advances in the future.",

Furthermore, the complete abrogation of tumor growth was observed with the co-treatment of erlotinib and silibinin. Silibinin fully reversed the EMT-related high miR-21/low miR-200c microRNA signature and repressed the mesenchymal markers SNAIL, ZEB, and N-cadherin observed in erlotinib-refractory tumors. Silibinin was sufficient to fully activate a reciprocal mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in erlotinib-refractory cells and prevent the highly migratogenic phenotype of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Given that the various mechanisms of resistance to erlotinib result from EMT, regardless of the EGFR mutation status, a water-soluble, silibinin-rich milk thistle extract might be a suitable candidate therapy for upcoming clinical trials aimed at preventing or reversing NSCLC progression following erlotinib treatment.

Patients with multiple brain metastases or with systemic metastases to any other organ were excluded. Survival was measured from the date of the first treatment for malignancy. All hospital records were thoroughly reviewed in a retrospective manner. Thirty-three patients were identified who met the study criteria. Twelve patients had primary disease limited to the lung and hilar nodes, and 21 had more advanced primary disease with involvement of the mediastinum. Treatment of the chest was considered aggressive in 13 patients and palliative in 15. The primary tumor was observed in 5 patients. The management of the brain metastasis was as follows: 21 patients underwent surgical resection and postoperative whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), 5 underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and WBRT, 3 had resection alone, 2 had SRS alone, and 2 underwent WBRT alone. The median overall and disease-free survival for all patients was 6.9 months and 3.3 months, respectively. Overall survival was markedly improved with the addition of WBRT (P = 0.002) and with the aggressive management of the primary tumor (P = 0.005). A total of 9 patients experienced CNS failure, including both patients receiving WBRT alone. CNS failures were divided as follows: 3 local, 5 distant, and 1 local and distant. Two of the 4 patients with a local failure were salvaged, and ultimate local control of the original brain metastasis was achieved in 93.6% of cases. Survival remains poor for patients with Stage IV NSCLC even when metastatic disease is limited to a single site within the brain; however, aggressive therapy of both the lung primary and the brain metastasis may provide a survival advantage. Excellent local control of single brain metastases was achieved with a combination of WBRT with either surgical resection or SRS.",

However, overall survival (OS) has reached a plateau, even with the improvement in these regimens. Advances in the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis have prompted the development of many novel molecular-targeted agents including the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Results of the recent phase III IPASS trial showed that the EGFR-TKI gefitinib has a superior progression-free survival (PFS) to the most commonly used platinum-based doublet carboplatin-paclitaxel as the first-line chemotherapy for pulmonary lung adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers in East Asia. This trial also demonstrated that the presence of EGFR mutation is the best predictor of gefitinib treatment compared with the other biomarkers including EGFR gene copy number. Despite the therapeutic benefit of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC, most patients eventually develop resistance to these drugs. A secondary mutation of EGFR (T790M) and amplification of MET account for 70% of all cases of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. This review summarizes the significance of EGFR mutations and the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC, both of which are critical for patient selection to extend survival as well as to overcome resistance in NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs.",

To guide clinical management of these patients and suggest the priorities for clinical research in this field, an International Expert Panel met in Naples, Italy, on April 19 to 20, 2004. Results and conclusions based on a review of evidence available in the literature to date are presented in this article. A comprehensive geriatric assessment is recommended to better define prognosis and to predict tolerance to treatment. In the first randomized study dedicated to elderly NSCLC patients, single-agent vinorelbine showed superiority over supportive care alone, both in terms of survival and quality of life. In a large randomized trial, gemcitabine plus vinorelbine failed to show any advantage over either agent alone. Subset analyses suggest that the efficacy of platinum-based combination chemotherapy is similar in fit older and younger patients, with an acceptable increase in toxicity for elderly patients. These data should be interpreted cautiously because retrospective subgroup analyses are encumbered by selection bias; hence, randomized trials dedicated to platinum-based chemotherapy for nonselected elderly patients are warranted. Several promising biologic therapies are under investigation; however, with present data, target-based agents as first-line treatment for elderly NSCLC patients are not yet recommended. Clinical research, with trials specifically designed for elderly patients, is mandatory. With the current evidence, single-agent chemotherapy with a third-generation drug (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, a taxane) should be the recommended option for nonselected elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. Platinum-based chemotherapy is a viable option for fit patients with adequate organ function. Best supportive care remains important, in addition to chemotherapy or as the exclusive option for patients who are unsuitable for more aggressive treatment.",

The median follow-up time for all patients was 18 months (range, 1-81 months). Survival analysis was based on intent to treat. Local progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years was 66% with CRT and 55% with RT. The 2-year distant PFS was 60% following CRT and 63% after RT. The 2-year PFS rates were 57% and 50%, respectively. The 2-year survival rate for patients treated with CRT was 57% and 33% in patients receiving RT.;Despite the use of CRT and routine staging with FDG-PET, both local and distant recurrences remain important causes of treatment failure in patients with inoperable stage I NSCLC.",

Qualitative interviews were held with a subset of patients to explore factors influencing adherence. Safety was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Quadriceps muscle strength, thigh lean mass, and physical activity level were assessed at baseline and after three cycles of chemotherapy.;49 patients (28 male, median (IQR) age 69 (64-75) years) participated.

About 90% of EGFR mutations are clustered in exons 19 (deletion) and 21 (point mutation at codon 858) and patients with these mutations have great response to EGFR-TKIs. However, tumors that initially respond to EGFR-TKIs almost inevitably become resistant later and T790M secondary mutation in the EGFR gene and MET amplification are reported to account for the mechanism of this acquired resistance. In this review, we summarize the recent findings about EGFR mutations, amplification, alterations of other related genes and sensitivity and acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We also discuss from our studies the relationship between EGFR mutations and other molecular alterations such as aberrant methylation in tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), which indicates that they are related to the mechanism of the pathogenesis of lung cancer.

Therefore, we determined the use of chemotherapy in a contemporary, diverse NSCLC population encompassing all patient ages.;We performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC from 2000 to 2007 at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Demographic, treatment, and outcome data were obtained from hospital tumor registries. The association between these variables was assessed using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.;In all, 718 patients met criteria for analysis. Mean age was 60 years, 58% were men, and 45% were white. Three hundred fifty-three patients (49%) received chemotherapy. In univariate analysis, receipt of chemotherapy was associated with age (53% of patients younger than 65 years versus 41% of patients aged 65 years and older; p = 0.003) and insurance type (p < 0.001). In a multivariate model, age and insurance type remained associated with receipt of chemotherapy. For individuals receiving chemotherapy, median survival was 9.2 months, compared with 2.3 months for untreated patients (p < 0.001).;In a contemporary population representing the full age range of patients with advanced NSCLC, chemotherapy was administered to approximately half of all patients-more than twice the rate reported in some earlier studies.

To achieve this goal, a close interaction between basic researchers, clinical scientists, molecular pathologists, and pharmaceutical companies is essential. We believe that this approach is worth the effort, since personalized therapy in lung cancer has the potential to substantially improve survival in an increasing number of patients. At the moment, established personalized treatment approaches include treatment of patients with NSCLC and activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations with the EGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib, and treatment of NSCLC patients with genetic aberrations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) oncogene with the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET)/ALK inhibitor crizotinib.

ALK-rearranged NSCLC are typically adenocarcinoma characterized by a solid signet-ring cell pattern that is frequently associated with a metastatic phenotype. Recent reports linked the presence of ALK rearrangement to an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in NSCLC, but the extent and the mechanisms of an ALK-mediated EMT in ALK-rearranged NSCLC are largely unknown. We found that the ALK-rearranged H2228 and DFCI032, but not the H3122, cell lines displayed a mesenchymal phenotype. In these cell lines, oncogenic ALK activity dictated an EMT phenotype by directly suppressing E-cadherin and up-regulating vimentin expression, as well as expression of other genes involved in EMT. We found that the epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1), a key regulator of the splicing switch during EMT, was repressed by EML4-ALK activity. The treatment of NSCLC cells with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) led to up-regulation of ESRP1 and E-cadherin, thus reverting the phenotype from mesenchymal to epithelial (MET). Consistently, ESRP1 knock-down impaired E-cadherin up-regulation upon ALK inhibition, whereas enforced expression of ESRP1 was sufficient to increase E-cadherin expression. These findings demonstrate an ALK oncogenic activity in the regulation of an EMT phenotype in a subset of NSCLC with potential implications for the biology of ALK-rearranged NSCLC in terms of metastatic propensity and resistance to therapy.

In an era of evidence-based medicine and increasing cost pressures, it is important to understand the relative clinical and economic impact of the many drug treatment strategies available for NSCLC. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature for pharmacoeconomic evaluations in the primary treatment of NSCLC published over the past decade (1 June 1997 to 1 June 2007) was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, Harvard Review of Economic Analyses, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health databases. A total of 19 studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of these studies, 58% were cost-effectiveness studies, 37% were cost-minimization studies and 5% were cost-utility studies. Most were from the EU (63%), were from the payer perspective (89%), were in advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC (84%) and were funded by drug manufacturers (68%). Drug treatments generally were found to be cost effective compared with best supportive care. In addition, cisplatin alone or in combination appeared to provide better value than carboplatin alone or in combination. We did not identify any studies of recently approved therapeutics (e.g. erlotinib or bevacizumab). The quality of studies varied but the majority did not meet recommended guidelines for economic evaluations, with only 43% using direct comparisons, 5% of studies being cost-utility studies and 26% using either statistical analysis of patient-level data or probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, there are a multitude of studies examining drug treatment for NSCLC; however, few of these utilized methodological approaches consistent with recommended guidelines. Despite these limitations, it appears that drug therapy compared with no treatment provides reasonable value for money, but carrying out more detailed comparisons of various agents is challenging. Given the absence of studies on newer therapeutics and the lack of cost-utility studies, additional studies are warranted.",

We have now investigated the effects of combination treatment with thymidylate synthase (TS)-targeting drugs and the second-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI BIBW2992 on the growth of NSCLC cells with the T790M mutation. The effects of BIBW2992 on EGFR signaling and TS expression in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells were examined by immunoblot analysis. The effects of BIBW2992 and the TS-targeting agents S-1 (or 5-fluorouracil) or pemetrexed on the growth of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of BIBW2992 with 5-fluorouracil or pemetrexed synergistically inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells with the T790M mutation in vitro, whereas an antagonistic interaction was apparent in this regard between gefitinib and either of these TS-targeting agents. BIBW2992 induced downregulation of TS in the gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells, implicating depletion of TS in the enhanced antitumor effect of the combination therapy. The combination of BIBW2992 and either the oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 or pemetrexed also inhibited the growth of NSCLC xenografts with the T790M mutation to an extent greater than that apparent with either agent alone.

In late 2004, RTOG 0236 using SBRT for medically inoperable patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was activated for accrual. Prior to activation, representatives from the Lung, Image-Guided Therapy, Physics, and Radiobiology Committees met on regular occasions to design the multicenter study and quality assurance measures. SBRT is not a black box, and the essence of the therapy had to be distilled via guidelines. Issues related to patient selection, method of dosimetry construction, equipment requirements, motion assessments and control, site accreditation, data exchange, and follow-up policies were worked out by compromise and consensus. RTOG 0236 has nearly completed its accrual. The Lung Committee has initiated the development of several other trials, each building on the last, to investigate the therapy in central tumors, in combinations with systemic therapy, in operable patients, and in lung metastases patients. The guidelines developed for RTOG 0236 will be refined to take advantage of more modern innovations including heterogeneity corrections and intensity modulation when appropriate.

Currently there are two EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib, approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. In a phase III trial (BR.21), treatment with erlotinib resulted in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients who had experienced progression after one or two previous chemotherapy treatments in comparison with best supportive care (BSC). In contrast, in the Iressa Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer (ISEL) trial, treatment with gefitinib did not result in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival time in comparison with BSC in patients who had received one or two previous chemotherapy treatments and were refractory to or intolerant of the previous chemotherapy. After the results of the ISEL trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted the use of gefitinib, and gefitinib was effectively removed from routine clinical practice within the U.S. However, gefitinib was approved in other countries and clinical trials investigating gefitinib continued. Recently the Iressa Non-small cell lung cancer Trial Evaluating REsponse and Survival against Taxotere (INTEREST) trial met the primary endpoint of demonstrating noninferiority in terms of overall survival for gefitinib (250 mg daily) in comparison with docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks). Patients treated with gefitinib experienced a lower rate of treatment-related toxicity and higher rate of improvement in quality of life. Results of recent gefitinib trials have been provocative, and suggest a role for gefitinib in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.",

Direct medical resource utilisation and costs associated with carboplatin and cisplatin administration over 3 to 6 courses of treatment were measured and compared. The perspective of this evaluation was that of the payer.;A convenience sample of 16 sites representing a mix of cancer centres, outpatient clinics, medical centres and managed-care sites in a general practice oncology setting participated.;Patients were included in this study if they were newly diagnosed with NSCLC, SCLC or ovarian cancer, had not received prior chemotherapy, received either carboplatin or cisplatin as their treatment (additional chemotherapy agents were allowed), and received at least 3 courses of carboplatin or cisplatin therapy up to a maximum of 6 courses. Patients receiving more than 6 courses of therapy were included in this study, but data collection on those patients stopped after the sixth course. Individuals involved with data collection at all sites were trained via on-site and/or teleconference training. Site visits were made to assure reliability of at least 0.80. Data were collected and compiled via a fax transmission process that scans directly through optical mark and character recognition into a computer database. Outcome measures included costs of: medications, emergency room visits, physician/clinic/laboratory visits, home healthcare visits, transfusions, special procedures, consultations, hospitalisations and other/miscellaneous costs.;Of 220 patients, 164 met the study criteria (response rate = 74.2%) with 95 patients in the carboplatin group (NSCLC = 45, SCLC = 18, ovarian = 32) and 69 in the cisplatin group (NSCLC = 36, SCLC = 21, ovarian = 12). The average number of courses were: NSCLC = 4.3 and 4.2, SCLC = 4.3 and 4.8, and ovarian = 4.7 and 5.1, respectively, for carboplatin and cisplatin. The total costs (treatment and toxicity) associated with the use of carboplatin were higher in NSCLC, similar in SCLC but lower in ovarian cancer.;These results indicate that overall treatment costs may vary depending on cancer type, even when the same drugs are used.

Structural dysfunction of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR is associated with the clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with NSCLC. The most common EGFR gene mutations occur as either deletions in exon 19 or as substitution L858R in exon 21 and cause a clinically beneficial response to gefinitib or erlotinib treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of patients finally develop resistance to these drugs. Acquired resistance is linked to secondary mutations localised in the EGFR gene, mainly substitution T790M in exon 20. Through intense research a few different mechanisms of resistance to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been identified: amplification of MET or IGF-1R genes, abnormalities of PTEN and mTOR proteins as well as rare mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes. Extensively investigated new drugs could be of significant efficiency in NSCLC patients with secondary resistance to reversible EGFR TKI. ",

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tumor tissue samples are an excellent source for determining key molecular changes in the OncoGenome; however, existing extraction procedures yield relatively poor quality genomic DNA fragments. Although FISH is the method of choice for determining amplification of a gene, a more rapid quantitative poly-merase chain reaction (qPCR) technique to determine gene copy number can be used when reasonably good quality genomic DNA is available. We report here a relatively rapid method based on microwave/chelex-100 treatment that gives rise to genomic DNA fragments ranging from 1 to 12 Kb and beyond, thereby attesting to its superior quality. Genomic PCR for beta-globin gene gave reliable and reproducible results. The number of steps for extracting the DNA was kept to a minimum, and instead of precipitating the DNA, we preserved the genomic DNA extracts so as to prevent a loss in DNA yield. We found the extracts to be stable and amenable to qPCR and mutational analysis. Using lung adenocarcinoma FFPE samples and cell lines derived from lung adenocarcinomas, we demonstrated that the gene copy number for MET in lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples was preferentially increased over EGFR, HGF, and PXN and that it positively correlated with a better prognosis. In contrast, the genomic DNA extracted from 25 NSCLC cell lines gave a relatively higher gene copy number for all four genes evaluated. Our results indicate that the microwave/chelex-100-based method yields good-quality genomic DNA extracts that can be used for complex DNA analysis, such as determination of gene copy number. In addition, our data demonstrated that the adenocarcinoma cell lines potentially evolved under ex vivo conditions, and therefore, in genetic studies it is imperative to use primary tumors for generalized conclusions about lung tumors.",

Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) was shown to predict cisplatin-based chemotherapy response; EGFR mutations were predictive of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition response.;This prospective randomized phase II trial enrolled 150 patients with completely resected non-squamous cell stage II or IIIA (non-N2) tumors. Patients in the control arm (n = 74) were treated with four standard-dose courses of cisplatin plus pemetrexed (CP). In the customized treatment arm (n = 76), patients with activated EGFR mutations received erlotinib 150 mg for 1 year; ERCC1-negative patients received four CP courses, whereas ERCC1-positive patients underwent follow-up. The trial sought to demonstrate the feasibility of customized adjuvant chemotherapy based on timely biomarker analysis within a 2-month postsurgery delay. Secondary objectives were tolerability, compliance with adjuvant therapy, and biomarker distribution.;In arm A, all patients received CP; in arm B, seven received erlotinib, 53 were administered CP, and 16 underwent follow-up. Median erlotinib exposure was 344 days. Of the 127 patients allocated to CP, 82% received four cycles with good tolerability. The overall success rate of the trial (ie, percentage of patients with complete biomarker status able to start adjuvant treatment within 2 months of surgery) was 80%.;The primary end point of the trial was met, demonstrating the feasibility of a national biology-driven trial in the adjuvant NSCLC setting. Nevertheless, the phase III part was canceled because of the unreliability of the ERCC1 immunohistochemical readouts.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Aberrant forms of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are involved in the pathogenesis of several types of cancer, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma and others. In general, the ALK catalytic domain is rearranged and fused to a dimerization domain encoded by an unrelated gene. Less frequently, full-length ALK is activated by point mutations. The common theme is unregulated firing of ALK downstream signalling, leading to uncontrolled cell division and increased cell survival. ALK-driven tumors can be treated with Crizotinib, an orally available dual ALK/MET inhibitor, currently approved for advanced ALK-positive NSCLCs. Crizotinib-treated patients achieve high response rates, with an excellent toxicity profile. However, drug-resistant disease often develops, particularly in NSCLC patients. The processes leading to drug resistance include both ALK-dependent (point mutations or gene amplification), as well as ALK-independent mechanisms, which are here briefly discussed. Recently, Ceritinib has been approved for Crizotinib-refractory NSCLC, further extending patients' survival, but resistance again emerged. Novel ALK kinase inhibitors are currently under clinical development, showing great promise for improved efficacy in drug-resistance disease. It is opinion of the author that drug-resistance is likely to arise under any treatment, due to intrinsic heterogeneity and adaptability of cancer. To prevent or delay this phenomenon, we need to treat less advanced disease, with drugs that are rapidly effective in order not to allow enough time for tumor evolution, and we want to have more and more drugs with non-overlapping resistance profiles, for subsequent lines of targeted therapy. Finally, the use of drug combinations may exponentially decrease the chances of resistance. ",

We analyzed 27 practicable samples using a tumor genotyping panel to assess 23 hot-spot sites of genetic alterations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2), gene copy number of EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2, and ALK, ROS1, and RET fusions. Additionally, 34 samples were analyzed by commercially available EGFR mutation tests.;Sixty-one patients underwent rebiopsy. Twenty-seven samples were analyzed using our tumor genotyping panel, and 34 samples were analyzed for EGFR mutations only by commercial clinical laboratories. Twenty-one patients (34 %) had EGFR T790M mutation. Using our tumor genotyping panel, MET gene copy number gain was observed in two of 27 (7 %) samples. Twenty patients received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs even after disease progression, and 11 of these patients had T790M mutation in rebiopsy samples. In contrast, only 10 of 41 patients who finished EGFR-TKI treatment at disease progression had T790M mutation. The frequency of T790M mutation in patients who received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs after disease progression was significantly higher than that in patients who finished EGFR-TKI treatment at disease progression (55 % versus 24 %, p = 0.018).;The frequency of T790M mutation in this study was lower than that in previous reports examining western patients.

Unfortunately, all patients develop acquired resistance and despite an initial benefit, virtually all patients progress due to the development of resistance. Several molecular mechanisms are responsible for acquired resistance and the two prominent are the up-regulation of the downstream signal by mesenchymal-epidermal transition (MET) amplification and the emergence of T790M EGFR gatekeeper mutation. Preclinical and early clinical trials suggested a potential efficacy of a new class of panHER inhibitor, also called irreversible or covalent inhibitor, in overcome acquired resistance related to T790M.

Here we evaluated the efficacy of a novel anti-RON antibody-drug maytansinoid conjugate Zt/g4-DM1 for treatment of breast and NSCLC xenograft tumors in mouse models and explored a treatment strategy by combination of Zt/g4-DM1 with chemotherapeutics to achieve the maximal therapeutic activity.;Mouse monoclonal antibody Zt/g4 (IgG1a/κ) specific to human RON was conjugated to DM1 via thioether linkage to form Zt/g4-DM1 with a drug-antibody ratio of 4:1. Several breast cancer and NSCLC cell lines, expressing different levels of RON, were used as the model. Immunofluorescence was used to determine Zt/g4-induced RON internalization. Flow cytometric analysis and cell viability assay were used to determine the effect of Zt-g4-DM1 on cell cycle and death. Mouse xenograft NSCLC models were used in vivo to determine the therapeutic efficacy of Zt/g4-DM1 alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics.;In vitro, Zt/g4 treatment of breast cancer and NSCLC cells rapidly induced cell surface RON internalization, which results in intracellular delivery of DM1 sufficient to arrest cell cycle at G2/M phase, reduce cell viability, and cause massive cell death. In mouse tumor xenograft models, Zt/g4-DM1 at 20 mg/kg in a Q12 × 2 regimen effectively blocked breast cancer and NSCLC cell- mediated tumor growth. More than 95% inhibition of tumor growth among three tumor xenograft models tested was achieved according to the measured tumor volume. The minimal dose to balance the tumor growth and inhibition (tumoristatic concentration) was established at 2.02 mg/kg for H2228, 1.94 mg/kg for H358 cell, and 6.25 mg/kg for T-47D cell-mediated xenograft tumors.;Zt/g4 is highly effective in RON-directed drug delivery for targeted inhibition of NSCLC cell-derived tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. This work provides the basis for clinical development of humanized Zt/g4-DM1 for potential cancer therapy in the future.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In an effort to improve the survival of cancer patients, new therapeutic approaches focusing on the molecular mechanisms that mediate tumour cell growth or survival have gained much attention. In particular, EGF-R and VEGF/VEGF-R have been extensively investigated as targets for anti-neoplastic therapy. Agents that selectively target EGF-R, erbB-2, VEGF-R-2 or VEGF have shown promising activity in clinical trials, and several are now approved for use in selected cancer indications. However, all patients ultimately develop resistance to these drugs. Thus, there is a great need to understand how patients become resistant to effective therapies for these cancers since this approach may lead to improvements in therapies that target EGF-R and VEGF/VEGF-R. Pre-clinical studies have begun to shed light on the mechanisms of resistance to anti-angiogenetic drugs and to date four mechanisms of resistance have been identified (1) upregulation of bFGF, (2) overexpression of MMP-9, (3) increased levels of SDF-1alpha and (4) HIF-1alpha-induced recruitment of bone marrow-derived CD45+ myeloid cells. In addition, the molecular mechanisms of resistance to EGF-R modulating agents can be attributed to several general processes: (1) activation of alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitors that bypass the EGF-R pathway (e.g. c-MET and IGF-1R), (2) increased angiogenesis, (3) constitutive activation of downstream mediators (e.g. PTEN and K-ras) and (4) the existence of specific EGF-R mutations. K-ras mutations have been significantly associated with a lack of response to EGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with NSCLC and with a lack of response to cetuximab or to panitumumab in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The identification of these resistance mechanisms has led to clinical trials using newly designed targeted therapies that can overcome resistance and have shown promise in laboratory studies. Ongoing research efforts will likely continue to identify additional resistance mechanisms, and these findings will hopefully translate into effective therapies for different cancers.",

Identification of further studies from references cited in trials identified by electronic searching.;Both randomised and non-randomised controlled trials in which patients with carcinoma of the bronchus and a diagnosis of SVCO had been treated with any combination of the following treatment modalities: steroids, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or insertion of an expandable metal stent.;There were 3 randomised and 98 non-randomised studies of which 2 and 44 respectively met the inclusion criteria.;SVCO was present at diagnosis in 10.0% of patients with SCLC and 1.7% of patients with NSCLC. In one randomised trial in SCLC, the rate of SVCO relapse was not significantly reduced by giving radiotherapy on completion of chemotherapy. In the other, in NSCLC, the addition of induction chemotherapy to a course of synchronous chemo-radiotherapy did not increase the rates of relief of SVCO. In SCLC, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy relieved SVCO in 77%; 17% of those treated had a recurrence of SVCO. In NSCLC, 60% had relief of SVCO following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy; 19% of those treated had a recurrence of SVCO. Insertion of an SVC stent relieved SVCO in 95%; 11% of those treated had further SVCO but recanalisation was possible in the majority resulting in a long-term patency rate of 92%. Morbidity following stent insertion was greatest if thrombolytics were administered. No study described the effectiveness of steroids in SVCO.;Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective in relieving SVCO in a proportion of patients whilst stent insertion appears to provide relief in a higher proportion and more rapidly. The optimal timing of stent insertion (whether at diagnosis or following failure of other modalities) is currently uncertain. The effectiveness of steroids in SVCO remains uncertain.",

Patients with somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene have dramatic response initially, but would eventually develop resistance to these TKIs. Subsequent studies found that a secondary mutation in the EGFR gene (T790M mutation) and amplification of the MET proto-oncogene could be the main resistance mechanisms involved. The current review is focused on T790M, which is thought to cause steric hindrance and impair the binding of gefitinib/erlotinib. The T790M is present as a minor allele before TKI therapy and accounts for about half of the acquired resistant cases. Conflicting results were reported for gefitinib-resistant, T790M-acquired patients who had switched to erlotinib treatment, which was proposed to be efficacious. The switch therapy was presumed to work for EGFR wild type patients and previously gefitinib responding patients. MET amplification accounts for about 20% of TKI acquired-resistant patients by a different molecular pathway from T790M; some of these patients will also concurrently have T790M mutation and might still not respond to irreversible TKI. As for the detection of T790M, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), especially mutant-enriched PCR was found to be more sensitive than direct DNA sequencing. In addition, whole genome amplification might also be useful and can be incorporated with future noninvasive method for detecting T790M. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to TKI resistance is crucial in the development of effective treatment and the design of future clinical studies.",

For progression-free survival (PFS), a pooled analysis of 3 trials (n = 378) demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for erlotinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.38).In a pooled analysis with 491 participants administered gefitinib, 2 trials (IPASS and NEJSG) demonstrated a statistically significant PFS benefit of gefitinib compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48).Afatinib (n = 709) showed a statistically significant PFS benefit when compared with chemotherapy in a pooled analysis of 2 trials (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53).Commonly reported grade 3/4 adverse events for afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib monotherapy were rash and diarrhoea. Myelosuppression was consistently worse in the chemotherapy arms, fatigue and anorexia were also associated with some chemotherapies.No statistically significant PFS or OS benefit for cetuximab plus cytotoxic chemotherapy (n = 81) compared to chemotherapy alone was reported in either of the two trials.Six trials reported on quality of life and symptom improvement using different methodologies. For each of erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, 2 trials showed improvement in one or more indices for the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) compared to chemotherapy.The quality of evidence was high for the comparisons of erlotinib and gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy and for the comparison of afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy.;Erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib are all active agents in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients, and demonstrate an increased tumour response rate and prolonged progression-free survival compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We also found a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, we found no increase in overall survival for the TKI when compared with standard chemotherapy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is less effective in EGFR M+ NSCLC than erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib and is associated with greater toxicity. There were no data supporting the use of monoclonal antibody therapy."},

        "Doc_abstract":"Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) serve as valuable biomarkers. However, EpCAM positive CTCs are less frequently detected in NSCLC patients compared to other epithelial tumours. First, EpCAM protein expression was analysed in primary and metastatic lung cancer tissue. In both groups 21% of the samples were EpCAM negative. Second, the CellSearch system identified 15% of patients (n = 48) as CTC positive whereas a multiplex RT-PCR for PIK3CA, AKT2, TWIST, and ALDH1 following EGFR, HER2 and EpCAM based enrichment detected CTCs in 29% of the patients. Interestingly, 86% of CTC positive patients were found to express ALDH1. Only 11% of the patients were CTC-positive by both techniques. CTC positivity was associated with patient disease state when assessed by the multiplex RT-PCR assay (p = 0.015). Patients harbouring tumours with an altered EGFR genotype were more frequently CTC-positive compared to patients with EGFR wildtype tumours. In subsets of patients, CTCs were found to express genes involved in resistance to therapy such as HER3 and MET. In conclusion, using multiple targets for CTC capture and identification increases the sensitivity of CTC detection in NSCLC patients, which can be explained by the presence of different CTC subtypes with distinct molecular features.

This research study of these mutations, present in about 10% of non-selected NSCLC, has to be preferred in case of clinical factors predictive of mutations (sex, race, tobacco status, adenocarcinoma), but don't have to be exclusive, the correlation between these clinical factors and the presence of the mutations being imperfect. Also, the research study of the EGFR mutations should be performed for patients non eligible for chemotherapy (PS>2). Molecular testing could be performed on biopsies, and also on cytology, knowing that there is a mismatch between the tumor and the metastasis for EGFR status. Samples should be prepared according to standardized protocols, avoiding fixation with Bouin. The gold-standard for molecular testing is still sequencing, but alternative targeted tests (allele-specific PCR...) seem to be more sensitive. Some immunohistochemistry tests are in development for EGFR mutations, but have to be validated on large prospective cohorts. At last, new tumoral sampling have to be performed in case of progression under gefitinib in first line, to look for acquired resistance EGFR mutations, or for other resistance molecular markers (Met amplification).",

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of erlotinib compared with standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of European patients with advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC.;We undertook the open-label, randomised phase 3 EURTAC trial at 42 hospitals in France, Italy, and Spain. Eligible participants were adults (> 18 years) with NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy ending ≥ 6 months before study entry was allowed). We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive oral erlotinib 150 mg per day or 3 week cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy of cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1) or gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8). Carboplatin (AUC 6 with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) or AUC 5 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2)) was allowed in patients unable to have cisplatin. Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation type and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received study drug (≥ 1 dose). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446225.;Between Feb 15, 2007, and Jan 4, 2011, 174 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled. One patient received treatment before randomisation and was thus withdrawn from the study; of the remaining patients, 86 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 87 to receive standard chemotherapy. The preplanned interim analysis showed that the study met its primary endpoint; enrolment was halted, and full evaluation of the results was recommended. At data cutoff (Jan 26, 2011), median PFS was 9·7 months (95% CI 8·4-12·3) in the erlotinib group, compared with 5·2 months (4·5-5·8) in the standard chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·37, 95% CI 0·25-0·54; p < 0·0001).

The aim of this study was to assess whether SL or PN offers a low morbidity and mortality and better long-term survival. We performed a meta-analysis of studies published in English between 1996 and 2006 to comprehensively compare the postoperative mortality, morbidity, locoregional recurrences, and time-to-event outcomes of SL and PN in NSCLC, and reviewed the recent literatures on PAR in the corresponding period as well. Twelve studies met the defined criteria including a total of 2984 subjects, and five studies for PAR. The odds ratio for postoperative mortality (SL vs PN) was 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42-1.01), 1.01 (95% CI: 0.70-1.44) for postoperative complications, and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.45-1.82) for locoregional recurrences. The weighted mean operative mortality for PAR was 3.3%, and 32.4% for complications. The estimated combined hazard ratio for overall survival in 10 studies was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.62-0.79) in favor of SL group. The median overall survival was 60 months for the SL group, 26 months for the PN group, and 30 months for PAR group. Survival difference in patients with pN0 or pN1 at 1 year demonstrated a pooled risk difference (SL vs PN) of 0.03 (95% CI: -0.08-0.13), 0.13 (95% CI: 0.00-0.25) in patients with pN2 at 1 year, 0.21 (95% CI: 0.07-0.36) in patients with pN0 or pN1 at 5 years, and 0.06 (95% CI: -0.10-0.21) in patients with pN2 at 5 years. Our results suggests that SL with or without PAR can be accomplished safely in selected patients without increasing the morbidity and mortality as compared to PN, that SL even with PAR offers better long-term survival than does PN, and that a more radical operation such as PN is not a more appropriate procedure, even in higher stage tumors.",

In these patients, erlotinib prolongs survival but its benefit remains modest because many tumors express wild-type (wt) EGFR or develop a second-site EGFR mutation. To test drug combinations that could improve the efficacy of erlotinib, we combined erlotinib with quinacrine, which inhibits the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex that is required for NF-κB transcriptional activity. In A549 (wtEGFR), H1975 (EGFR-L858R/T790M), and H1993 (MET amplification) NSCLC cells, this drug combination was highly synergistic, as quantified by Chou-Talalay combination indices, and slowed xenograft tumor growth. At a sub-IC50 but more clinically attainable concentration of erlotinib, quinacrine, alone or in combination with erlotinib, significantly inhibited colony formation and induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Quinacrine decreased the level of active FACT subunit SSRP1 and suppressed NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity. Knockdown of SSRP1 decreased cell growth and sensitized cells to erlotinib. Moreover, transcriptomic profiling showed that quinacrine or combination treatment significantly affected cell-cycle-related genes that contain binding sites for transcription factors that regulate SSRP1 target genes. As potential biomarkers of drug combination efficacy, we identified genes that were more strongly suppressed by the combination than by single treatment, and whose increased expression predicted poorer survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. This preclinical study shows that quinacrine overcomes erlotinib resistance by inhibiting FACT and cell-cycle progression, and supports a clinical trial testing erlotinib alone versus this combination in advanced NSCLC.",

Recent studies have shown that Notch signal is associated with drug resistance. However, the exact mechanism of Notch during acquisition of resistance to EGFR-TKI in human lung cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we showed that the expression of Notch-1 was highly upregulated in EGFR-TKI acquired resistant lung cancer cells. More importantly, Notch-1 contributed to the acquisition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, which was critically associated with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. Silencing of Notch-1 using siRNA resulted in mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), which was associated with impaired invasion and anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer and resensitisation to gefitinib in acquired resistant NSCLC cells. Finally, gefitinib treatment of Balb/c nu/nu with acquired resistant lung cancer xenografts in combination with Notch inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-(S)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) resulted in effective tumour growth retardation, with decreased proliferative activity and increased apoptotic activity.

Tumor response to chemotherapy was scored by RECIST criteria. Treatment plans based on tumor extent prior to chemotherapy were generated based on equivalent planning constraints and techniques as the original post-chemotherapy plans. Dosimetric parameters predictive of toxicity for lung, esophagus, heart, and spinal cord were compared amongst the pre- and post-ICT plans.;The majority of patients (70%) experienced an overall reduction in GTV size between the pre-ICT imaging and the time of simulation. Comparing pre-and post-ICT diagnostic imaging, 5 patients met the RECIST criteria for response, 23 were classified as stable, and 2 experienced disease progression on diagnostic imaging. Despite a significantly reduced GTV size in the post-ICT group, no systematic improvements in normal tissue doses were seen amongst the entire cohort. This result persisted amongst the subgroup of patients with larger pre-ICT GTV tumor volumes (>100 cc(3)). Among patients with RECIST-defined response, a significant reduction in lung mean dose (1.9 Gy absolute, median 18.2 Gy to 16.4 Gy, p = 0.04) and V20, the percentage of lung receiving 20 Gy (3.1% absolute, median 29.3% to 26.3%, p = 0.04) was observed.

However, these benefits were not realized for the cohort as a whole or for patients with larger tumors upfront.

        "Doc_abstract":"Clinical resistance to gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in patients with lung cancer has been linked to acquisition of the T790M resistance mutation in activated EGFR or amplification of MET. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss has been recently reported as a gefitinib resistance mechanism in lung cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of radiotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with acquired gefitinib resistance caused by PTEN deficiency to suggest radiotherapy as an alternative to EGFR TKIs. PTEN deficient-mediated gefitinib resistance was generated in HCC827 cells, an EGFR TKI sensitive NSCLC cell line, by PTEN knockdown with a lentiviral vector expressing short hairpin RNA-targeting PTEN. The impact of PTEN knockdown on sensitivity to radiation in the presence or absence of PTEN downstream signaling inhibitors was investigated. PTEN knockdown conferred acquired resistance not only to gefitinib but also to radiation on HCC827 cells. mTOR inhibitors alone failed to reduce HCC827 cell viability, regardless of PTEN expression, but ameliorated PTEN knockdown-induced radioresistance. PTEN knockdown-mediated radioresistance was accompanied by repression of radiation-induced cytotoxic autophagy, and treatment with mTOR inhibitors released the repression of cytotoxic autophagy to overcome PTEN knockdown-induced radioresistance in HCC827 cells. These results suggest that inhibiting mTOR signaling could be an effective strategy to radiosensitize NSCLC harboring the EGFR activating mutation that acquires resistance to both TKIs and radiotherapy due to PTEN loss or inactivation mutations.",

Since the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy in 2004, no substantial progress has been made in adjuvant treatment. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the MAGE-A3 cancer immunotherapeutic in surgically resected NSCLC.;In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients aged at least 18 years with completely resected stage IB, II, and IIIA MAGE-A3-positive NSCLC who did or did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy from 443 centres in 34 countries (Europe, the Americas, and Asia Pacific). Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 13 intramuscular injections of recMAGE-A3 with AS15 immunostimulant (MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic) or placebo during 27 months. Randomisation and treatment allocation at the investigator site was done centrally via internet with stratification for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. A minimisation algorithm accounted for the number of chemotherapy cycles received, disease stage, lymph node sampling procedure, performance status score, and lifetime smoking status. The primary endpoint was broken up into three co-primary objectives: disease-free survival in the overall population, the no-chemotherapy population, and patients with a potentially predictive gene signature. The final analyses included the total treated population (all patients who had received at least one treatment dose). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00480025.;Between Oct 18, 2007, and July 17, 2012, we screened 13 849 patients for MAGE-A3 expression; 12 820 had a valid sample and of these, 4210 (33%) had a MAGE-A3-positive tumour. 2312 of these patients met all eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to treatment: 1515 received MAGE-A3 and 757 received placebo and 40 were randomly assigned but never started treatment. 784 patients in the MAGE-A3 group also received chemotherapy, as did 392 in the placebo group. Median follow-up was 38·1 months (IQR 27·9-48·4) in the MAGE-A3 group and 39·5 months (27·9-50·4) in the placebo group. In the overall population, median disease-free survival was 60·5 months (95% CI 57·2-not reached) for the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic group and 57·9 months (55·7-not reached) for the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·02, 95% CI 0·89-1·18; p=0·74). Of the patients who did not receive chemotherapy, median disease-free survival was 58·0 months (95% CI 56·6-not reached) in those in the MAGE-A3 group and 56·9 months (44·4-not reached) in the placebo group (HR 0·97, 95% CI 0·80-1·18; p=0·76). Because of the absence of treatment effect, we could not identify a gene signature predictive of clinical benefit to MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic. The frequency of grade 3 or worse adverse events was similar between treatment groups (246 [16%] of 1515 patients in the MAGE-A3 group and 122 [16%] of 757 in the placebo group). The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher adverse events were infections and infestations (37 [2%] in the MAGE-A3 group and 19 [3%] in the placebo group), vascular disorders (30 [2%] vs 17 [3%]), and neoplasm (benign, malignant, and unspecified (29 [2%] vs 16 [2%]).;Adjuvant treatment with the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic did not increase disease-free survival compared with placebo in patients with MAGE-A3-positive surgically resected NSCLC.

The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the relationship between survival and maximum SUV (SUV(max)) analyzed as a continuous variable, in patients with NSCLC, staged using PET/computed tomography (CT) and treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.;Eligible patients had a histological diagnosis of NSCLC, were treated with radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy as their primary treatment, and had pretreatment PET/CT scans. SUV(max), defined as the maximum pixel SUV value retrieved from the primary tumor, was analyzed primarily as a continuous variable for overall survival.;Eighty-eight patients met eligibility criteria: stage I, 19; stage II, 10; and stage III, 59. Median SUV(max) was 15.0 (range, 2.5-56). Higher stage was associated with higher SUV(max) values (p = 0.048). In univariate analysis, there was no evidence of a prognostic effect of SUV(max) (hazard ratio per doubling = 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.11; p = 0.22). Analyzing SUV(max) as a dichotomous variable (median cut point = 15.0), the hazard ratio (high: low) for risk of death was 0.71, with p = 0.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.44-1.15).;In this cohort of patients, increasing SUV(max) derived from F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT was associated with increasing tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage.

Here, we tested whether the targeted inhibition of EGFR may revert this effect and reactivate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;Sensitive (HCC827) and resistant (H1975 and H1993) NSCLC cells were treated with a panel of EGFR or MET inhibitors, and then tested for changes of EGFR signaling, glycolytic cascade, and mitochondrial function. Silencing of key glycolytic enzymes was then performed with targeted siRNAs. Furthermore, tumor-bearing nude mice treated with EGFR inhibitors were evaluated with (18)F-FDG PET/CT and tumors were analyzed for glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins.;Effective inhibition of EGFR signaling in NSCLC cells induced a dramatic reduction of hexokinase II (HKII) and phospho-pyruvate kinase M2 (p-PKM2, Tyr105) levels as well as an upregulation of mitochondrial complexes subunits (OXPHOS). Accordingly, a decreased lactate secretion and increased intracellular ATP levels were also observed in response to EGFR inhibitors. Downregulation of HKII and PKM2 by targeted siRNA transfection did not cause upregulation of OXPHOS but enhanced the effects of EGFR TKIs. Conversely, selective inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 caused OXPHOS upregulation and glycolysis inhibition, respectively. Similar findings were obtained in tumors from animals treated with appropriate EGFR inhibitors.;Our findings indicate that EGFR inhibitors may reactivate oxidative phosphorylation of cancer cells and provide a mechanistic clue for the rational combination of agents targeting EGFR-dependent proliferation and glucose metabolism in cancer therapy.",

CDDP was administered by drip infusion at a dose of 20 mg/m(2) on a 5-day schedule from day 8 to 12. Treatment was repeated every 4 weeks as long as the criteria for initiation of therapy were still met. Between April 1995 and March 1997, 51 patients were entered into the study. The mean age of all 50 eligible patients was 64 years(range: 40-78). There were 21 patients with clinical stage IIIB disease and 29 patients with IV disease. Thirty-two patients had adenocarcinoma, 14 had epidermoid carcinoma, and four had large cell carcinoma. Of the 47 assessable patients, 18 achieved a partial response with an overall response rate of 38.3% (95% confidence interval: 24.4-52.2%). The median response duration was 113 days. The median survival time of the eligible patients was 12.8 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 54%. Among the 51 patients enrolled, grade 3 or 4 leukopenia developed in one patient (2%), neutropenia in six patients (11. 8%), thrombocytopenia in six patients (11. 8%), and anemia in three patients (5. 9%). Non-hematological grade 3 or 4 toxicities included anorexia in 10 patients (19.6%), nausea in ten (19.6%), vomiting in two (3.9%), and diarrhea in two (3. 9%). Grade 3 abnormal laboratory data included bilirubinemia in four (7. 8%), GPT elevation in one (2.0%), and hematuria in one (2.0%). In conclusion, combination of CDDP plus oral UFT is efficacious, with low toxicity, in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

Post-treatment imaging was reviewed to identify specific locations of disease progression. Patients' maximum SUV (SUVmax_pat) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV_pat) were evaluated as predictors of clinical outcomes using logrank testing. Competing risks analysis was performed to examine the relationship between lesion (tumor or lymph node) MTV (MTV_les) and the risk of local disease progression. Patient death and progression in other sites were treated as competing risks.;28 patients with 82 hypermetabolic lesions (27 pulmonary tumors, 55 lymph nodes) met inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 39.0 months for living patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.4 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 31.8 months.

For those with limited metastases, we developed a paradigm of adding concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the primary tumor once the tumor demonstrated chemotherapy sensitivity.;Charts of patients from 1999-2006 with non-small cell lung cancer were reviewed to find those with a single extra-thoracic site of disease treated with combined modality therapy. We found nine patients of 640 who met these criteria. Initial treatment consisted of induction chemotherapy, except for brain metastases which were managed first (n=1). If patients experienced a response to chemotherapy without new metastases, the extra-thoracic site was treated for total control with curative dose chemoradiotherapy to the primary site. Survival, time to progression, and sites of progression were assessed.;Median survival was 28 months (95% CI 18-50 mo) with median time to progression of 15 months (95% CI 8-24 mo).

The expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and changes in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) status including the expression of E-cadherin and γ-catenin as epithelial markers, and those of vimentin and fibronectin as mesenchymal markers, were evaluated by immunohistochemistry.;Eight of the gefitinib refractory tumors exhibited a secondary threonine-to-methionine mutation at codon 790 in EGFR (T790M). All of the tumors had wild type KRAS gene expression. No MET amplification was detected in any of the samples. A strong expression of HGF was detected in eight of the specimens at post-treatment. A change in the EMT status between pre-and post-treatment was found in five cases. The 5-year survival rate of patients with and without T790M was 86.7% and 13.3%, respectively (p=0.020). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for patients with overexpresion and for those with weak expression of HGF was 75.0% and 22.2%, respectively (p=0.259). In addition, the 5-year OS rate for patients with unchanged and changed EMT status was 83.3% and 40.0%, respectively (p=0.123).;The current results showed that the presence of T790M is associated with favorable survival. On the other hand, the patients with weak HGF expression and EMT change tend to have a poor survival. The current patients' selection might be changed by discrimination of acquired resistance-related molecules in patients with NSCLC treated with an EGFR-TKI.",

Patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized (2:1) to 400 mg/day apricoxib plus 150 mg/day erlotinib (AP/E) or placebo plus erlotinib (P/E) in 21-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP). A decrease of 50% or more from baseline urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolite after a 5-day, open-label, run-in period was used to select eligible patients. One hundred twenty patients (median age 64 years) were randomized (78 to AP/E and 42 to P/E). Overall median TTP was 1.8 months in the AP/E group and 2.1 months in the P/E group, with a 12% objective response rate in both groups (intent-to-treat analysis). A subgroup analysis in patients aged 65 years or younger demonstrated a statistically significant TTP benefit for AP/E (hazard ratio 0.5 [95% confidence interval: not applicable-0.9]; p=0.018) and overall survival advantage at minimum 1-year follow-up (median 12.2 versus 4.0 months; hazard ratio=0.5; p=0.021). The most common adverse events were rash, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. Toxicity contributed to early discontinuations in patients aged more than 65 years treated with AP/E. This is the first randomized placebo-controlled study of a COX-2 inhibitor in NSCLC to use a prospective patient-selection strategy. Although AP/E seemed to improve TTP and overall survival in a subset of patients aged 65 years or younger, the primary endpoint of the trial was not met. ",

The goal of our study was to evaluate the frequencies of co-occurring mutations and copy-number aberrations (CNAs) within the same tumor and to evaluate their potential clinical impact. Mass-spectrometry based mutation profiling using a customized lung cancer panel evaluating 214 mutations across 26 key NSCLC genes was performed on 230 nonsquamous NSCLC and integrated with genome-wide CNAs and clinical variables. Among the 138 cases having at least one mutation, one-third (41, 29.7%) showed two or more mutations, either in the same gene (double mutation) or in different genes (co-mutations). In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant cancers, there was a double mutation in 18% and co-mutations in the following genes: TP53 (10%), PIK3CA (8%), STK11 (6%) and MET (4%). Significant relationships were detected between EGFR mutation and 1p, 7p copy gains (harboring the EGFR gene) as well as 13q copy loss. KRAS mutation was significantly related with 1q gain and 3q loss. For Stage I, tumors harboring at least one mutation or PIK3CA mutation were significantly correlated with poor prognosis (p-value = 0.02). When combining CNAs and mutational status, patients having both KRAS mutation and the highest related CNA (3q22.3 copy loss) showed a significant poorer prognosis (p-value = 0.03).

Here, we focused our attention on the anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), where the oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK, responsible for 70% to 80% of cases, represents an ideal crizotinib target. We selected and characterized 2 human NPM-ALK+ ALCL cell lines, KARPAS-299 and SUP-M2, able to survive and proliferate at different crizotinib concentrations. Sequencing of ALK kinase domain revealed that a single mutation became predominant at high crizotinib doses in each cell line, namely L1196Q and I1171N in Karpas-299 and SUP-M2 cells, respectively. These mutations also conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells expressing human NPM-ALK. The resistant cell populations, as well as mutated Ba/F3 cells, were characterized for sensitivity to two additional ALK inhibitors: the dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113 and NVP-TAE684. While L1196Q-positive cell lines were sensitive to both inhibitors, cells carrying I1171N substitution showed cross-resistance to all ALK inhibitors tested.

A gradient-based segmentation tool was used to contour each patient's primary tumor. MTV, maximum SUV, and 43 textural features were extracted for each tumor. To address overfitting and high collinearity among PET features, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to identify features that were independent predictors of overall survival (OS) after adjusting for MTV. Recursive binary partitioning in a conditional inference framework was utilized to identify optimal thresholds. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank testing were used to compare outcomes among patient groups.;Two hundred one patients met inclusion criteria.

This grouped patients into three categories: low tumor MTV (n = 155; median OS, 22.6 mo), high tumor MTV and high SumMean (n = 23; median OS, 20.0 mo), and high tumor MTV and low SumMean (n = 23; median OS, 6.2 mo; log-rank P < 0.001).;We have described an appropriate methodology to evaluate the prognostic value of textural PET features in the context of established prognostic factors.

Here, patients were randomized to either afatinib or cisplatin-pemetrexed and the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) was easily met (HR=0.58, P=0.001). This was the first large-scale trial of this type using a modern chemotherapy comparator, including Asian and non-Asian patients, central radiology review, and utilizing comprehensive patient-reported outcomes. Whilst efficacy for afatinib was markedly superior to chemotherapy, do the patient-reported outcomes reflect this superiority? The symptom control and quality of life (QoL) data from this trial has now been published. Analysis of these demonstrate clear superiority of afatinib over chemotherapy for delay in cough deterioration, and dyspnoea. Notably, given the toxicity profile of afatinib, these improvements translated into significant improvements in global health status, physical, role, and cognitive functioning. The clinical benefits for afatinib over cisplatin-pemetrexed chemotherapy for EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung patients seem overwhelming, and are clinically meaningful. These results are also consistent with QoL data from other trials of gefitinib/erlotinib, but much more robust, given the larger patient numbers. Would patients agree that afatinib is superior to chemotherapy? On the basis of data presented, the answer is probably \"Yes\". However, the key unanswered question remaining is \"Which is the best EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to use up front?\" and we will have to wait until ongoing trial data can help answer this.

The majority of patients, however, will eventually develop resistance and succumb to the disease. Recent studies have identified secondary mutations in the EGFR (EGFR T790M) and amplification of the N-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine (MNNG) HOS transforming gene (MET) oncogene as two principal mechanisms of acquired resistance. Although they can account for approximately 50% of acquired resistance cases together, in the remaining 50%, the mechanism remains unknown. In NSCLC-derived cell lines and early-stage tumors before erlotinib treatment, we have uncovered the existence of a subpopulation of cells that are intrinsically resistant to erlotinib and display features suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We showed that activation of TGF-beta-mediated signaling was sufficient to induce these phenotypes. In particular, we determined that an increased TGF-beta-dependent IL-6 secretion unleashed previously addicted lung tumor cells from their EGFR dependency. Because IL-6 and TGF-beta are prominently produced during inflammatory response, we used a mouse model system to determine whether inflammation might impair erlotinib sensitivity. Indeed, induction of inflammation not only stimulated IL-6 secretion but was sufficient to decrease the tumor response to erlotinib. Our data, thus, argue that both tumor cell-autonomous mechanisms and/or activation of the tumor microenvironment could contribute to primary and acquired erlotinib resistance, and as such, treatments based on EGFR inhibition may not be sufficient for the effective treatment of lung-cancer patients harboring mutant EGFR.",

Late toxicity, disease control, and survival were also evaluated.;Twelve patients (3 per dose level) underwent treatment. All treatment plans met predetermined dose-volume constraints. The mean age was 64 years. Most patients had stage III disease (92%) and were medically inoperable (92%). The maximum dose level was reached with no grade 3 to 5 acute toxicities.

Gefitinib, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is in clinical use for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations. However, despite high initial response rates, many patients develop resistance to gefitinib. The molecular mechanisms of TKI resistance often remain unclear. Here, we describe a chemical proteomic approach comprising kinase affinity purification (kinobeads) and quantitative mass spectrometry for the identification of kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms in cancer cells. We identified the previously described amplification of MET and found EPHA2 to be more than 10-fold overexpressed (p < 0.001) in gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells suggesting a potential role in developing resistance. siRNA-mediated EPHA2 knock-down or treating cells with the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib restored sensitivity to gefitinib. Of all dasatinib targets, EPHA2 exhibited the most drastic effect (p < 0.001). In addition, EPHA2 knockdown or ephrin-A1 treatment of resistant cells decreased FAK phosphorylation and cell migration. These findings confirm EPHA2 as an actionable drug target, provide a rational basis for drug combination approaches, and indicate that chemical proteomics is broadly applicable for the discovery of kinase inhibitor resistance.

We compared the efficacy of cabozantinib alone or in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC.;This three group, randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial was done in 37 academic and community oncology practices in the USA. Patients were eligible if they had received one or two previous treatments for advanced non-squamous, EGFR wild-type, NSCLC. Patients were stratified by performance status and line of therapy, and randomly assigned using permuted blocks within strata to receive open-label oral daily dosing of erlotinib (150 mg), cabozantinib (60 mg), or erlotinib (150 mg) and cabozantinib (40 mg). Imaging was done every 8 weeks. At the time of radiographic progression, there was optional crossover for patients in either single-drug group to receive combination treatment. The primary endpoint was to compare progression-free survival in patients given erlotinib alone versus cabozantinib alone, and in patients given erlotinib alone versus the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib.

Evidence is emerging for the role of PET in response assessment to neoadjuvant therapy, combined-modality therapy, and early detection of recurrence. Here, we review the current literature on these aspects of PET in the management of NSCLC. FDG-PET, particularly integrated (18)F-FDG-PET/CT, scans have become a standard test in the staging of local tumor extent, mediastinal lymph node involvement, and distant metastatic disease in NSCLC. (18)F-FDG-PET sensitivity is generally superior to computed tomography (CT) scans alone. Local tumor extent and T stage can be more accurately determined with FDG-PET in certain cases, especially in areas of post-obstructive atelectasis or low CT density variation. FDG-PET sensitivity is decreased in tumors <1 cm, at least in part due to respiratory motion. False-negative results can occur in areas of low tumor burden, e.g., small lymph nodes or ground-glass opacities. (18)F-FDG-PET-CT nodal staging is more accurate than CT alone, as hilar and mediastinal involvement is often detected first on (18)F-FDG-PET scan when CT criteria for malignant involvement are not met. (18)F-FDG-PET scans have widely replaced bone scintography for assessing distant metastases, except for the brain, which still warrants dedicated brain imaging. (18)F-FDG uptake has also been shown to vary between histologies, with adenocarcinomas generally being less FDG avid than squamous cell carcinomas. (18)F-FDG-PET scans are useful to detect recurrences, but are currently not recommended for routine follow-up. Typically, patients are followed with chest CT scans every 3-6 months, using (18)F-FDG-PET to evaluate equivocal CT findings. As high (18)F-FDG uptake can occur in infectious, inflammatory, and other non-neoplastic conditions, (18)F-FDG-PET-positive findings require pathological confirmation in most cases. There is increased interest in the prognostic and predictive role of FDG-PET scans. Studies show that absence of metabolic response to neoadjuvant therapy correlates with poor pathologic response, and a favorable (18)F-FDG-PET response appears to be associated with improved survival. Further work is underway to identify subsets of patients that might benefit individualized management based on FDG-PET.",

Relative risks (calculated according to a random-effects model) were determined with respect to overall survival, progression-free survival and treatment morbidity.;Fourteen randomised studies (including 2393 patients) of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone met the inclusion criteria. In a meta-analysis there was a reduction in risk of death at two years (relative risk (RR) 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; P = 0.01).

The incidence of acute oesophagitis, neutropenia and anaemia were significantly increased by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

In both cases there was some increase in acute oesophagitis. Caution is advised in adopting concurrent chemoradiotherapy as the standard of care because of uncertainties about the true magnitude of benefit in comparison with sequential chemoradiotherapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a high precision radiotherapy technique used for the treatment of small to moderate extra-cranial tumours. Early studies utilising SBRT have shown favourable outcomes. However, major disadvantages of static field SBRT include long treatment times and toxicity complications. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may potentially mitigate these disadvantages. This review aims to assess the feasibility of emerging VMAT and IMRT-based SBRT treatment techniques and qualify which offers the best outcome for patients, whilst identifying any emerging and advantageous SBRT planning trends. A review and synthesis of data from current literature up to September 2013 was conducted on EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Proquest central, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews. Only full text papers comparing VMAT and or IMRT and or Static SBRT were included. Ten papers were identified that evaluated the results of VMAT/IMRT SBRT. Five related to medically inoperable stage 1 and 2 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), three to spinal metastasis, one related to abdominal lymph node malignancies, with the final one looking at pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Overall treatment times with VMAT were reduced by 66-70% for lung, 46-58% for spine, 42% and 21% for lymph node and pancreatic metastasis respectively, planning constraints were met with several studies showing improved organs at risk sparing with IMRT/VMAT to static SBRT. Both IMRT and VMAT were able to meet all planning constraints in the studies reviewed, with VMAT offering the greatest treatment efficiency. Early clinical outcomes with VMAT and IMRT SBRT have demonstrated excellent local control and favourable survival outcomes. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The purpose of the study was to evaluate Monte Carlo-generated dose distributions with the X-ray Voxel Monte Carlo (XVMC) algorithm in the treatment of peripheral lung cancer patients using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with non-protocol dose-volume normalization and to assess plan outcomes utilizing RTOG 0915 dosimetric compliance criteria. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocols for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) currently require radiation dose to be calculated using tissue density heterogeneity corrections. Dosimetric criteria of RTOG 0915 were established based on superposition/convolution or heterogeneities corrected pencil beam (PB-hete) algorithms for dose calculations. Clinically, more accurate Monte Carlo (MC)-based algorithms are now routinely used for lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) dose calculations. Hence, it is important to determine whether MC calculations in the delivery of lung SBRT can achieve RTOG standards. In this report, we evaluate iPlan generated MC plans for peripheral lung cancer patients treated with SBRT using dose-volume histogram (DVH) normalization to determine if the RTOG 0915 compliance criteria can be met. This study evaluated 20 Stage I-II NSCLC patients with peripherally located lung tumors, who underwent MC-based SBRT with heterogeneity correction using X-ray Voxel Monte Carlo (XVMC) algorithm (Brainlab iPlan version 4.1.2). Total dose of 50 to 54 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions was delivered to the planning target vol-ume (PTV) with at least 95% of the PTV receiving 100% of the prescription dose (V100% ≥ 95%). The internal target volume (ITV) was delineated on maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of 4D CT scans. The PTV included the ITV plus 5 mm uniform margin applied to the ITV. The PTV ranged from 11.1 to 163.0 cc (mean = 46.1 ± 38.7 cc). Organs at risk (OARs) including ribs were delineated on mean intensity projection (MeanIP) images of 4D CT scans. Optimal clinical MC SBRT plans were generated using a combination of 3D noncoplanar conformal arcs and nonopposing static beams for the Novalis-TX linear accelerator consisting of high-definition multileaf collimators (HD-MLCs: 2.5 mm leaf width at isocenter) and 6 MV-SRS (1000 MU/min) beam. All treatment plans were evaluated using the RTOG 0915 high- and intermediate-dose spillage criteria: conformity index (R100%), ratio of 50% isodose volume to the PTV (R50%), maximum dose 2 cm away from PTV in any direction (D2cm), and percent of normal lung receiving 20Gy (V20) or more. Other OAR doses were documented, including the volume of normal lung receiving 5 Gy (V5) or more, dose to &lt; 0.35 cc of spinal cord, and dose to 1000 cc of total normal lung tissue. The dose to &lt; 1 cc, &lt; 5 cc, &lt; 10 cc of ribs, as well as maximum point dose as a function of PTV, prescription dose, and a 3D distance from the tumor isocenter to the proximity of the rib contour were also examined. The biological effective dose (BED) with α/β ratio of 3 Gy for ribs was analyzed. All 20 patients either fully met or were within the minor deviation dosimetric compliance criteria of RTOG 0915 while using DVH normalization. However, only 5 of the 20 patients fully met all the criteria. Ten of 20 patients had minor deviations in R100% (mean = 1.25 ± 0.09), 13 in R50% (mean = 4.5 ± 0.6), and 11 in D2cm (mean = 61.9 ± 8.5). Lung V20, dose to 1000 cc of normal lung, and dose to &lt; 0.35 cc of spinal cord were met in accordance with RTOG criteria in 95%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, with exception of one patient who exhibited the largest PTV (163 cc) and experienced a minor deviation in lung V20 (mean = 4.7±3.4%). The 3D distance from the tumor isocenter to the proximal rib contour strongly correlated with maximum rib dose. The average values of BED3Gy for maximum point dose and dose to &lt; 1 cc of ribs were higher by a factor of 1.5 using XVMC compared to RTOG 0915 guidelines. The preliminary results for our iPlan XVMC dose analyses indicate that the majority (i.e., 75% of patient population) of our patients had minor deviations when compared to the dosimetric guidelines set by RTOG 0915 protocol. When using an exclusively sophisticated XVMC algorithm and DVH normalization, the RTOG 0915 dosimetric compliance criteria such as R100%, R50%, and D2cm may need to be revised. On average, about 7% for R100%, 13% for R50%, and 14% for D2cm corrections from the mean values were necessary to pass the RTOG 0915 compliance criteria. Another option includes rescaling of the prescription dose. No further adjustment is necessary for OAR dose tolerances including normal lung V20 and total normal lung 1000 cc. Since all the clinical MC plans were generated without compromising the target coverage, rib dose was on the higher side of the protocol guidelines. As expected, larger tumor size and proximity to ribs correlated to higher absolute dose to ribs. These patients will be clinically followed to determine whether delivered MC-computed dose to PTV and the ribs dose correlate with tumor control and severe chest wall pain and/or rib fractures. In order to establish new specific MC-based dose parameters, further dosimetric studies with a large cohort of MC lung SBRT patients will need to be conducted. "},

        "Doc_abstract":"In April 2013 our group published a review on predictive molecular pathology in this journal. Although only 2 years have passed many new facts and stimulating developments have happened in diagnostic molecular pathology rendering it worthwhile to present an up-date on this topic. A major technical improvement is certainly given by the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS; amplicon, whole exome, whole genome) and its application to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in routine diagnostics. Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs. In the near future this will open new strategies to apply 'off-label' targeted therapies, e.g. for rare tumors, otherwise resistant tumors etc. The clinically relevant genetic aberrations described in this review include mutation analyses of RAS (KRAS and NRAS), BRAF and PI3K in colorectal cancer, KIT or PDGFR alpha as well as BRAF, NRAS and KIT in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we present several recent advances in the molecular characterization of malignant lymphoma. Beside the well-known mutations in NSCLC (EGFR, ALK) a number of chromosomal aberrations (KRAS, ROS1, MET) have become relevant. Only very recently has the clinical need for analysis of BRCA1/2 come up and proven as a true challenge for routine diagnostics because of the genes' special structure and hot-spot-free mutational distribution. The genetic alterations are discussed in connection with their increasingly important role in companion diagnostics to apply targeted drugs as efficient as possible. As another aspect of the increasing number of druggable mutations, we discuss the challenges personalized therapies pose for the design of clinical studies to prove optimal efficacy particularly with respect to combination therapies of multiple targeted drugs and conventional chemotherapy. Such combinations would lead to an extremely high complexity that would hardly be manageable by applying conventional study designs for approval, e.g. by the FDA or EMA. Up-coming challenges such as the application of methylation assays and proteomic analyses on FFPE tissue will also be discussed briefly to open the door towards the ultimate goal of reading a patients' tissue as 'deeply' as possible. Although it is yet to be shown, which levels of biological information are most informative for predictive pathology, an integrated molecular characterization of tumors will likely offer the most comprehensive view for individualized therapy approaches. To optimize cancer treatment we need to understand tumor biology in much more detail on morphological, genetic, proteomic as well as epigenetic grounds. Finally, the complex challenges on the level of drug design, molecular diagnostics, and clinical trials make necessary a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic type of lung cancer. To address advances in oncology, molecular biology, pathology, radiology, and surgery of lung adenocarcinoma, an international multidisciplinary classification was sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society. This new adenocarcinoma classification is needed to provide uniform terminology and diagnostic criteria, especially for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), the overall approach to small nonresection cancer specimens, and for multidisciplinary strategic management of tissue for molecular and immunohistochemical studies.;An international core panel of experts representing all three societies was formed with oncologists/pulmonologists, pathologists, radiologists, molecular biologists, and thoracic surgeons. A systematic review was performed under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society Documents Development and Implementation Committee. The search strategy identified 11,368 citations of which 312 articles met specified eligibility criteria and were retrieved for full text review. A series of meetings were held to discuss the development of the new classification, to develop the recommendations, and to write the current document. Recommendations for key questions were graded by strength and quality of the evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.;The classification addresses both resection specimens, and small biopsies and cytology. The terms BAC and mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer used. For resection specimens, new concepts are introduced such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) for small solitary adenocarcinomas with either pure lepidic growth (AIS) or predominant lepidic growth with ≤ 5 mm invasion (MIA) to define patients who, if they undergo complete resection, will have 100% or near 100% disease-specific survival, respectively. AIS and MIA are usually nonmucinous but rarely may be mucinous. Invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern after using comprehensive histologic subtyping with lepidic (formerly most mixed subtype tumors with nonmucinous BAC), acinar, papillary, and solid patterns; micropapillary is added as a new histologic subtype. Variants include invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous BAC), colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma. This classification provides guidance for small biopsies and cytology specimens, as approximately 70% of lung cancers are diagnosed in such samples. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), in patients with advanced-stage disease, are to be classified into more specific types such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, whenever possible for several reasons: (1) adenocarcinoma or NSCLC not otherwise specified should be tested for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as the presence of these mutations is predictive of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, (2) adenocarcinoma histology is a strong predictor for improved outcome with pemetrexed therapy compared with squamous cell carcinoma, and (3) potential life-threatening hemorrhage may occur in patients with squamous cell carcinoma who receive bevacizumab. If the tumor cannot be classified based on light microscopy alone, special studies such as immunohistochemistry and/or mucin stains should be applied to classify the tumor further. Use of the term NSCLC not otherwise specified should be minimized.;This new classification strategy is based on a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma that incorporates clinical, molecular, radiologic, and surgical issues, but it is primarily based on histology. This classification is intended to support clinical practice, and research investigation and clinical trials. As EGFR mutation is a validated predictive marker for response and progression-free survival with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, we recommend that patients with advanced adenocarcinomas be tested for EGFR mutation. This has implications for strategic management of tissue, particularly for small biopsies and cytology samples, to maximize high-quality tissue available for molecular studies. Potential impact for tumor, node, and metastasis staging include adjustment of the size T factor according to only the invasive component (1) pathologically in invasive tumors with lepidic areas or (2) radiologically by measuring the solid component of part-solid nodules."}]
