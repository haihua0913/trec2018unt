        "Doc_abstract":"Oncogenic BRAF mutations are found in several tumor types, including melanomas and colorectal cancers. Tumors with BRAF mutations have increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity and heightened sensitivity to BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors. To identify potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we generated clones resistant to the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from two BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that are highly sensitive to MEK or BRAF inhibition. These AZD6244-resistant (AR) clones, which exhibited cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors, acquired resistance through amplification of the BRAF gene. A small percentage of treatment-naïve parental cells showed preexisting BRAF amplification. We observed similar amplification in a subset of cells in a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. In cell lines, BRAF amplification increased the abundance of phosphorylated MEK and impaired the ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. The ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in AR cells was restored by treatment with a BRAF inhibitor at low concentrations that reduced the abundance of phosphorylated MEK to amounts observed in parental cells. Combined MEK and BRAF inhibition fully overcame resistance to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone and was also more effective in parental cells compared to treatment with either inhibitor alone. These findings implicate BRAF amplification as a mechanism of resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors and suggest combined MEK and BRAF inhibition as a clinical strategy to overcome, or possibly prevent, this mechanism of resistance.",

We also detected PI3K-PTEN-AKT-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. Distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. Beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from BRAF inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to BRAF inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.

Several aberrant events including RTK upregulation, NRAS mutation, mutant BRAF amplification or alternative splicing, and MEK mutation have been reported as acquired BRAFi resistance mechanisms. Clinially, detection of these resistance mechanisms help understand drug response patterns and help guide combinatorial therapeutic strategies. Therefore, quick and accurate diagnosis of the resistant mechanisms in tumor biopsies has become an important starting point for personalized therapy.

In cell lines, (V600E)B-RAF overexpression and knockdown conferred B-RAF inhibitor resistance and sensitivity, respectively. In (V600E)B-RAF amplification-driven (versus mutant N-RAS-driven) B-RAF inhibitor resistance, extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation is saturable, with higher doses of vemurafenib down-regulating phosho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and re-sensitizing melanoma cells to B-RAF inhibitor. These two mechanisms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation are sensitive to the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244/selumetinib or its combination with the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib. In contrast to mutant N-RAS-mediated (V600E)B-RAF bypass, which is sensitive to C-RAF knockdown, (V600E)B-RAF amplification-mediated resistance functions largely independently of C-RAF.

In cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to rebound levels of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; including PDGFRβ), phosphatidyl (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), pleckstrin homology domain recruitment, and p-AKT. PTEN expression limited this BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling, which could be rescued by the introduction of a mutant AKT1 (Q79K) known to confer acquired BRAFi resistance. Functionally, AKT1(Q79K) conferred BRAFi resistance via amplification of BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition enhanced clonogenic growth dependency on PI3K or AKT.

Its mechanism of action involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF V600E kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Its efficacy is restricted to melanomas carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, which is seen in approximately 50% of all melanomas. In a randomized phase III trial, it was superior to dacarbazine in first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 48% (95% CI 42, 45), an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.3 versus 1.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26; 95% CI 0.20, 0.33; p < 0.001) and a statistically superior 12-month overall survival (OS) rate of 55% versus 43% (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49, 0.77]). Vemurafenib is generally well tolerated, but its use can be associated with development of cutaneous neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and keratoacanthoma (KA). These lesions can be excised safely without the need for withholding the drug or reducing its dose. Mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib do not involve development of secondary mutations in the BRAF kinase domain, but may be related to BRAF V600E over-amplification, bypassing mechanisms via upregulation and overexpression of other components in the MAPK signalling cascade or activation of alternative pathways with potential to enhance cell growth, proliferation and survival. Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway. Also under investigation is the use of vemurafenib in other solid tumours with BRAF mutations, such as papillary thyroid cancer.",

Therefore the first aim of our study was to evaluate those distinct genetic alterations which can properly differentiate the three important molecular subtypes of primary melanomas with a) BRAF, b) NRAS mutation and c) WT (wild type for both loci). High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used to assess genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations. Primary melanomas with BRAF mutation more frequently exhibited losses on 10q23-10q26 and gains on chromosome 7 and 1q23-1q25 compared to melanomas with NRAS mutation. Loss on the 11q23-11q25 sequence was found mainly in conjunction with NRAS mutation. Based on these results, we proved the existence of marked differences in the genetic pattern of the BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma subgroups, which might suggest that these mutations contribute to the development of malignant melanoma in conjunction with distinct cooperating oncogenic events. In general, it is an interesting phenomenon suggesting that these mutations provide probably the \"guiding force\" for these tumors and it also suggests that there are alternative genetic pathways to melanoma. These additional oncogenic events which are associated with BRAF or NRAS mutations can provide rational additional targets for a combination therapy with kinase inhibitors. In this study we also investigated the specific dynamic activities among different signalling pathways highlighting the frequent alterations of genes involved in the signalling interactions between the MAPK-JAK pathways in BRAF mutated melanomas. Using a data mining algorithm we also found a gene alteration signature in the MAPK pathway that was commonly related to the presence of BRAF mutation in our melanoma cohorts. The second aim of this study was to develop an accurate Q-PCR method for determining the co-amplification pattern of six candidate genes that reside in the 11q13 amplicon core. We found that co-amplification of these candidate genes or the CCND1 amplification along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone. ;A malignus melanóma a legrosszabb indulatú bõrdaganat, mely fokozott metasztázisképzéssel és gyógyszer-rezisztenciával jellemezhetõ.

Further mechanism investigation revealed that 6a could sustainably inhibit the activation of the MAPK path way in the resistant SK-MEL-28 PR30 melanoma cancer cells and WiDr colorectal cancer cells with EGFR amplification.

Despite the remarkable clinical activities achieved by vemurafenib and dabrafenib in treating BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma, their clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer is far less impressive. Prior studies suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling upon BRAF inhibition might contribute to the relative unresponsiveness of colorectal cancer to the first-generation BRAF inhibitors. Here, we report characterization of a dual RAF kinase/EGFR inhibitor, BGB-283, which is currently under clinical investigation. In vitro, BGB-283 potently inhibits BRAF(V600E)-activated ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. It demonstrates selective cytotoxicity and preferentially inhibits proliferation of cancer cells harboring BRAF(V600E) and EGFR mutation/amplification. In BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. In vivo, BGB-283 treatment leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition accompanied by partial and complete tumor regressions in both cell line-derived and primary human colorectal tumor xenografts bearing BRAF(V600E) mutation.

The main objective of our work was to investigate the relationship between mutant BRAF DNA in plasma and clinical response. Thirty-eight stage IV patients with a V600 mutated BRAF melanoma were included prior to any treatment. DNA was extracted from plasma and mutant DNA was detected using the amplification-refractory mutation system method. Before the beginning of any treatment, the corresponding BRAF mutation was detected in 29 of the 38 tested plasma samples (76.3% positive per cent agreement). We observed a strong correlation between the presence of circulating mutated DNA and overall survival (OS; P=.02), and with the number of metastatic sites (P=.01). The presence of circulating mutated DNA was also strongly correlated with serum LDH activity (P<.01) and S100 protein concentration (P<.01). Finally, seven patients presented discordant BRAF status in different tumor sites. In all these patients, the test performed on ctDNA was positive, suggesting that ctDNA analysis might be less sensitive to tumor heterogeneity. Altogether, these results suggest that plasmatic mutant BRAF DNA is a prognostic factor of OS, correlated with tumor burden. In addition, it represents an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations before treatment. ",

Also, cyclin D1 overexpression is a common feature of resistance to BRAF inhibitors.
