        "Background":"['Background', ' In-frame insertions between codons 775 and 881 in exon 20 of the ERBB2 gene, of which a 12 base pair YVMA insertion is the most common, are activating mutations in 2%-4% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and have also been reported in exon 19 and 20 in breast cancer. These driver mutations are not captured with IHC or FISH staining because in the majority of cases, the ERBB2 gene is not amplified and HER2 protein is not overexpressed. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides a non-invasive means of identifying these potential driver mutations.Method', ' Guardant360TM is a targeted cfDNA NGS panel using hybrid capture and complete exon sequencing for single nucleotide variant detection in 70 genes, copy number amplifications (CNA) in 16 genes, and fusions in six genes and indels in EGFR, ERBB2 and MET exon 14 skipping. De-identified pathology and genotyping reports were reviewed for consecutive patients in which ERBB2 indels were identified in clinical practice.Results', ' Guardant360 identified ERBB2 indels in 27 of 2,093 (1.3%) of non-squamous NSCLC cases, with a single concomitant ERBB2 gene amplification. For this ERBB2 indel series, pathology reports revealed no patients with HER2 amplification via IHC or FISH, nor ERBB2 point mutation via NGS, but were only available in 25% of cases. Eight of the ERBB2 indels were confirmed by tissue NGS reports with zero false positives (100% PPV). 80% of ERBB2 indels were the common p.Tyr772_Ala775dup (YVMA insertion) in exon 20 followed by other insertions in codons 772 through 814. A single ERBB2 exon 20 p.Leu755_Glu757delinsProLys net deletion at 3.9% mutant allele fration (MAF) was noted in one patient, for whom outcome data was available. Initial tissue was IHC negative for HER2 overexpression at the referring hospital where the archival tissue biopsy was exhausted and so could not be sequenced. Based on the cfDNA finding of ERBB2 indel, the patient was switched from cytotoxic chemotherapy to trastuzumab with objective response on PET/CT and a repeat Guardant360 showed the ERBB2 indel MAF had dropped below the test limit of detection. After four months the patient progressed and it was decided to switch to ado-emtansine trastuzumab (T-DM1) in late November.Results', ' ERBB2 indels can be identified without tissue in NSCLC patients with 100% PPV in this modest cfDNA series. In a patient whose tissue was not available for sequencing, an objective response with trastuzumab was obtained.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Amplification of the ERBB2 (HER2) gene is a well-known genetic aberration in many tumor entities. Up to 20% of breast and gastric cancer show ERBB2 gene amplification and anti-HER2 targeting therapies are well established for these tumors. In other tumor entities such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer and bladder cancer the fraction of ERBB2 amplified tumors is considerably lower. In contrast to breast cancer, these tumors show heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in a substantial proportion. Oncogenic EGFR mutation with subsequent EGFR amplification is a common phenomenon in lung cancer. In analogy, primary ERBB2 mutation could explain the observed heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in some tumors. Methods', '  100 tumors showing ERBB2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization were examined for ERBB2 mutation', ' 50 breast cancer samples, including 10 cases with borderline gene amplification, 10 cases with heterogeneous gene amplification and 11 samples of metastatic lesions as well as 15 colorectal carcinomas, 12 gastric carcinomas, 12 non-small cell lung cancers and 10 urothelial carcinomas. Tumor DNA was extracted and examined for mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-23) of the ERBB2 gene by Sanger sequencing. Results', '  ERBB2 mutation was found in two metastatic lesions of breast cancer, two lung cancers and two colorectal cancers. In five of these cases short in-frame insertions in exon 20 were found. In one case of a breast cancer lung metastasis a missense mutation in exon 19 (p.L755S) was detected. The semi-quantitative chromatograms show an overrepresentation of the mutations indicating a selective amplification of the mutated allele. Conclusions', '  In certain tumor entities the heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification indicates a late genetic event. The finding of a concomitant mutation in ERBB2 amplified tumors might explain the heterogeneity in some of these tumors. The effect of a primary oncogenic ERBB2 mutation might be increased by selective amplification of the mutated allele resulting in an additional growth advantage. If ERBB2 amplified tumors with a primary ERBB2 mutation also benefit from an HER2 targeted therapy needs to be elucidated.']",

There are 3 approved and multiple targeted therapies in clinical trials that rely on the results of these tests. ERBB2 amplification and activation by mutation/fusion has also been described in a wide variety of other ST. As these alterations are not routinely tested for but may predict response to anti-ERBB2 agents we sought to determine their frequency in an unselected cohort of specimens from advanced ST patients.    Methods', '  We reviewed genomic profiles from the first 2,223 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens received and analyzed by our CLIA-certified lab (Foundation Medicine) with our NGS platform. 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 14 genes frequently rearranged were assayed for base pair substitutions, small insertions/deletions (indels), amplifications, and rearrangements.   Results', '  110/2,223 (4.9%) specimens had 116 ERBB2 alterations', ' 67 (58%) amplifications, 29 (25%) substitutions, 16 (14%) indels, 2 (2%) splice site variants and 2 (2%) translocations, including a potential fusion. Six samples (5%) had multiple alterations, and two had both ERBB2 substitution and amplification.  14 ST types had evidence of ERBB2 alterations including 29% of esophageal, 20% of uterine, 14% of breast, and 12% of stomach carcinomas. 6% of all lung cancer samples had ERBB2 alterations. Amplifications predominated, but lung specimens had predominantly indels. Durable responses exist to anti-ERBB2 agents in STs with activating ERBB2 mutations.  Conclusions', '  Use of a broad NGS panel identifies an unprecedented number of actionable genomic changes including a significant rate of ERBB2 alterations across 14 different solid tumor types. The discovery of unanticipated ERBB2 amplifications and activating mutations in a wide variety of ST highlights the need to study a broad range of genes at a high level of sensitivity and specificity when searching for novel targets of therapy.

Methods', '   Patients with stage IV HER2-mutant lung cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering were reviewed. Patient demographics, types of HER2 mutations, survival, and duration of systemic treatments were documented.   Results', '    37 patients with HER2-mutant lung cancers were identified', ' median age 62; majority were women (n = 24), never smokers (n = 21), and had adenocarcinomas (n = 36, 1 adenosquamous).

In particular, mutations or copy number variations of EGFR or ERBB2 are present in human malignancies and serve as predictive markers for targeted therapies. Recent efforts to comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape of human cancers have identified frequent somatic mutations in ERBB4 in various cancer types, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and colorectal cancer. However, the significance of mutated ERBB4 in cancer remains elusive.Here, we have functionally characterized nine ERBB4 mutations previously identified in lung adenocarcinoma. Four out of the nine mutations, Y285C, D595V, D931Y and K935I, were found to be activating, increasing both basal and ligand-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation. According to structural analysis, the four activating mutations were located at critical positions at the dimerization interfaces of the ErbB4 extracellular (Y285C, D595V) and kinase (D931Y and K935I) domains. Consistently, the mutations enhanced ErbB4 dimerization and increased the trans activation in ErbB4 homodimers and ErbB4/ErbB2 heterodimers. The expression of the activating ERBB4 mutants promoted survival of NIH 3T3 cells in the absence of serum. Interestingly, serum starvation of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the ERBB4 mutants only moderately increased the phosphorylation of canonical ErbB signaling pathway effectors Erk1/2 and Akt as compared to wild-type ERBB4. In contrast, the mutations clearly enhanced the proteolytic release of signaling-competent ErbB4 intracellular domain.These results suggest the presence of activating, oncogenic mutations of ERBB4 in non-small cell lung cancer.']",

This study was undertaken to develop an ultra-deep plasma NGS panel for patients with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).Methods / Results', ' Plasma was prospectively collected from 51 patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC and a known oncogenic driver from prior tumor genotyping. We performed ultra-deep NGS on extracted cfDNA using a customized Illumina library preparation, hybrid capture panel covering 37 lung cancer related genes (complete exons and partial introns), and ultra-deep sequencing (HiSeq4000). Mean sequencing depth was 50,000X (150 million, 150bp reads per sample). After specialized consensus-based error correction for low allele frequency (AF) genomic alterations, the median unique DNA molecules per position were 3,500. The mean sequence error rate was reduced by 20-fold to 0.002%, enabling the confident call of a driver mutation as low as 0.03%. In a subset of cases, paired plasma droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed for common EGFR and KRAS mutations using a validated assay.Blinded to tumor genotype, plasma NGS detected SNVs (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF), indels (EGFR, ERBB2), and fusions (ALK, ROS1) as well as significant copy number gains (CNG) (ERBB2, MET). Sensitivity of cfDNA for the detection of known oncogenic drivers was 88% (45/51). A single false positive driver mutation was identified in a case with a known EGFR mutation in tumor; plasma NGS found both EGFR exon 19 del (0.88% AF) and KRAS G12D (2.65% AF), and plasma ddPCR confirmed the presence of both mutations (2.2% and 2.0% AF).

Afatinib is an irreversible TKI for EGFR and HER2 and known to be effective to the EGFR T790M variant. However, a half of the patient responded afatinib acquire resistance by 12 months in clinical use. Thus, to unravel the mechanisms of the resistances and to overcome them are still important issues of EGFR-TKI treatment. In this study, we established various kinds of afatinib resistant cell lines with changing drug exposing condition as we previously reported (Shien K. et al Cancer Res. 2013). We also investigated these cell lines to understand mechanisms of afatinib resistances in NSCLC.[Materials and Methods] Afatinib resistant cell lines were established using four NSCLC cell lines with activating EGFR mutations by exposing afatinib with different procedures, escalation from 1 nM, escalation from 10 nM, intermittent 2 M and continuous 2 M procedures. These cell lines were investigated about previously reported resistant related features, T790M mutation, MET amplification, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ALDH1A1 and ABCB1 expression, which were putative stem cell markers, were also investigated. Proliferative inhibitions with various drugs were evaluated using MTS assay.[Results] There were no T790M mutations in all afatinib resistant cell lines. HCC827 sublines exposed afatinib with escalation from 1 nM and intermittent 2 M, and HCC4011 sublines showed MET amplification. HCC827 sublines exposed afatinib with escalation from 10 nM and continuous 2 M, and HCC4006 sublines showed EMT features. Furthermore, ALDH1A1 and ABCB1 expression were up-regulated in HCC827 afatinib resistant sublines with EMT features. Next, we examined the effect of afatinib or crizotinib for the afatinib resistant cell line with MET amplification. We found that combination therapy with afatinib and crizotinib was effective to the MET amplified cell. The combination exposure was continued to establish a resistant subline (HCC827-ACR) to combination therapy. The HCC827-ACR was also showed EMT features and up-regulation of stem cell markers.[Conclusions] As in the cases of reversible EGFR-TKI, MET amplification, EMT, and stem cell-like features were emerged in afatinib resistant cells.

However, the fraction of ctDNA obtained from a blood sample is often low ( < 1.0%) and can be difficult to detect with current approaches. Additionally, most methods to detect ctDNA interrogate single hot spot mutations or a few genetic alterations.   Methods', '   To overcome these issues, we developed comprehensive ctDNA approaches to detect somatic sequence mutations, translocations, and amplifications at low allele frequencies in the circulation of cancer patients.

This comprehensive panel covers many recognized resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies and provides a method to understand patterns of intrinsic and acquired resistance in oncogene defined lung cancer. To evaluate this approach, we performed dilution series using tumor-derived DNA, containing well-characterized somatic mutations, in the presence of wild-type DNA in 3-5ml of plasma from 90 patients with late-stage lung cancer.

In order to expand the treatment options for NSCLC harboring oncogenic K-Ras, new therapeutic cell surface targets need to be identified and characterized. Towards this goal we carried out comparative cell surface analysis of the NSCLC cell line H2122-KRASG12C and the BL2122 cell line (i.e., control), which has been established from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the same NSCLC patient. Here, we describe optimized hydrazide-based glycoproteomics for mapping of the cell surface proteome of the NSCLC H2122 cell line harboring oncogenic KRASG12C. Our comparative glycoproteomics revealed 632 proteins identified by LC-MS at the surface of both H2122-KRASG12C and BL2122 cell lines. Subtractive proteomics revealed 215 proteins detected solely at the H2122-KRASG12C cell surface while 214 proteins were found germane to the cell surface of BL2122 cells. A total of 203 proteins were commonly identified at the surface of both cell lines. Spectral counting based quantitation revealed 44 proteins showing  3-fold increase in their relative concentration at the cell surface of H2122-KRASG12C cells. Subsequent meta-analysis via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed significant activation of canonical pathways known to be involved in NSCLC biology (e.g., EGFR/neuregulin, and PI3K/AKT signaling). From a subset of proteins showing significant up-regulation at the surface of H2122-KRASG12C cells, we further cross-validated CD147 using immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) and Western blotting (WB). Interestingly, subsequent IFA confirmed the over-expression of CD147 at the cell surface of pancreatic KP-3, lung H2444, and colon SW620 cancer cell lines, each harboring constitutively activated KRAS. Importantly, amongst 215 proteins identified solely at the cell surface of H2122-KRASG12C cells, proteins upstream of K-Ras, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (ERBB2), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3 (ERBB3), and disintegrin metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) were unambiguously identified. Using WB analysis, we first confirmed the expression K-Ras in the membrane preparation of H2122-KRASG12C cells. Interestingly, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, (IGF1R), and mesothelin (MSLN) were also detected exclusively at the cell surface of the H2122-KRASG12C. We further cross-validated the expression of mesothelin using WB. Taken together, present approach greatly extends the known cell surface phenotype of the NSCLC H2122-KRASG12C cells and can be readily employed as a primary proteomic screen to provide the basis for discovery and characterization of novel cell surface therapeutic targets or diagnostic assays in cells/tissues harboring oncogenic K-Ras.']",

Int J Cancer. 2001;92', '474-9). We found that HER2 was more frequently overexpressed in SCLC cell lines of Japanese origin (6/10) compared to those of Caucasian origin (0/3). We also detected HER2 expression in SCLC tissues in 7 out of 25 patients tested by our highly sensitive immunohistochemistry system. Moreover, we found that HER2 was upregulated when HER2-positive SCLC cells acquired MDR. Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2, exerted differential levels of killing effect on HER2-positive parental and chemoresistant SCLC cells only when Fc receptor-positive natural killer (NK) cells coexisted. This result suggests that trastuzumab-induced SCLC cell-killing effect was caused mainly via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) but not via direct inhibition of HER2 signal. Among these cell lines, etoposide-resistant SCLC cells were most susceptible to trastuzumab in vitro and in vivo, and the antitumor effects of trastuzumab were not only dependent on the amount of HER2 expression on SCLC cells. We focused on cell-cell contact between SCLC cells and NK cells to determine the molecule affecting trastuzumab-mediated ADCC other than HER2. We found that intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 was abundantly expressed on etoposide-resistant SCLC cells, and trastuzumab-mediated ADCC was canceled in the presence of an ICAM-1 functional blocking antibody. These results indicate that ICAM-1 expression on SCLC cell surface is indispensable to augment trastuzumab-mediated ADCC. Thus, trastuzumab could overcome etoposide-resistance in SCLC. On the contrary, irinotecan-resistant SCLC cells were still refractory to trastuzumab. The reason for this was thought that they not only lacked ICAM-1 expression but also came to produce abundant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, treatment could significantly inhibit the in vivo growth of irinotecan-resistant xenografts through decreasing microvesseles in mice. These results suggest that bevacizumab-mediated antiangiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy to salvage irinotecan-resistance.Collectively, targeting stepwise HER2 and VEGF could overcome MDR in SCLC and bring about a favorable outcome for patients with relapsed-SCLC.']",

Despite this high response rate, patients almost inevitably develop resistance to these drugs on average within a year of starting drug treatment. Acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs is most commonly due to the emergence of a secondary mutation (T790M) in EGFR (in 50% of cases), amplification of the genes encoding the ERBB2 and MET receptor tyrosine kinases in 12 and 5% of cases, respectively, and phenotypic transformation of the adenocarcinomas to small cell lung cancer (5% of cases). Previously, in an effort to develop strategies to overcome T790M-mediated resistance, we generated tetracycline-inducible transgenic mice that express the EGFRL858R+T790M in the lung epithelium. Upon administration of doxycycline these mice develop lung adenocarcinomas that are resistant to TKIs. However, the combination of the irreversible TKI afatinib and the EGFR antibody cetuximab showed dramatic responses in these transgenic mice. These preclinical studies led to a clinical trial of these agents, which has showing a promising 30% response rate in patients with EGFR mutant tumors resistant to TKIs. However, tumors also acquire resistance to this drug combination and the mechanisms of resistance to afatinib+cetuximab are currently unknown. We set out to identify these mechanisms using xenograft and transgenic mouse models of EGFR mutant lung cancer. Transgenic mice with EGFRL858R+T790M-induced tumors were treated with afatinib+cetuximab using an intermittent dosing strategy that we had previously used to generate erlotinib-resistant tumors in mice with EGFRL858R and EGFRDEL-induced tumors. 75% of mice develop afatinib+cetuximab resistant tumors after three month-long rounds of treatment. The same treatment strategy applied to xenografts harboring subcutaneous tumors induced by EGFRDEL+T790M gave rise to resistant tumors in 20% of cases. Analysis of the afatinib+cetuximab resistant tumors performed to date has not revealed additional mutations in the EGFR transgene, the ERBB2 kinase domain or KRAS.

        "Background":"['Local mammary estrogen production may be vital for breast cancer development because about 70% of breast cancers occur in postmenopausal women. Aromatase is a key enzyme essential for estrogen biosynthesis, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the most effective endocrine treatment for estrogen-responsive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. However, they are also accompanied a number of severe side-effects on bone and joints. Many researchers are currently focusing on developing the novel mammary-specific AIs to prevent or treat breast cancer to minimize the side effects of treatment. Phenformin, an antidiabetic drug, lowers serum glucose levels via activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and reduces tumor burden and prolongs survival in non-small cell lung cancers. In vitro studies show that activated AMPK inhibits human mammary adipose tissue aromatase expression via suppression of binding of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) to aromatase promoters I.3/II, leading to decreased estrogen formation. We hypothesized that phenformin will be an effective adipose-specific AI for prevention and treatment of breast cancer. However, one of the major obstacles to define in vivo effects of phenformin on mammary aromatase expression is the lack of suitable mouse models because aromatase expression, present in the human breast, is absent in the mouse mammary gland. We developed a unique humanized aromatase mouse model (Aromhum) to mimic the human aromatase expression pattern and physiology in the mouse. We observed that tumorigenesis was accelerated in the mice overexpressing ERBB2 that were crossed with Aromhum mice (AE mice). Phenformin treatment (i.p., 70 mg/kg /day for 14 days) significantly decreased blood glucose levels by 37% in AE mice as compared to vehicle treatment. Phosphorylation of CREB, a downstream effector of the AMPK pathway, which mediates aromatase expression, was significantly decreased. Furthermore, after phenformin administration, mammary aromatase mRNA expression in AE mice was significantly decreased by 58% and estrogen response genes (SUSD3 and cyclin D1) were also reduced by about 65%. Real-time PCR showed that mammary AMPK1 mRNA expression is 10-fold higher compared with AMPK2 mRNA. Moreover, phenformin treatment significantly decreased AMPK1 mRNA levels by 53% but not AMPK2 mRNA expression in AE mice. Interestingly, daily oral phenformin treatment for 7 days significantly reduced mammary tumor volume of AE mice by 76%. In conclusion, phenformin decreased mammary aromatase expression and possible estrogen production, and reduced tumorigenesis via upregulation of the AMPK pathway in breast tissue of AE mice. This study provides justification for future testing of the adipose-specific preventive and therapeutic potential of the metabolic drug phenformin in postmenopausal breast cancer with minimal side-effects.']",

We recently demonstrated in head and neck cancer cells that, depending on the ErbB3 expression level and on the tumor cell phenotype (epithelial vs mesenchymal), vorinostat, one of the two clinically approved histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), differentially regulates HER receptors expression at the transcriptional level and/or by modulating protein degradation (Bruzzese F. et al. J Cell Physiol. 2011; 226(9)', '2378-90). Our group has developed a monoclonal antibody against ErbB3 called A3, that induces receptor internalization and degradation, inhibits growth and induces apoptosis only in cells overexpressing surface ErbB3 and potentiates the efficacy of EGFR TKIs (Noto A. et al. Oncotarget. 2013; 4(8)', '1253-65).In this study we first show, by using a set of malignant pleural effusion derived cell cultures from NSCLC patients (Mancini R. et al. PLOSone 2011; 6(7)', 'e21320) that the combination of the anti-ErbB3 antibody A3 with HDACi such as vorinostat or valproic acid (VPA), synergistically affect cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Interestingly synergistic interaction was observed in both fully epithelial cells expressing all HER receptors including ErbB3, as well as in NSCLC cells that had undergone EMT and expressed very low levels of ErbB3. We provide evidences suggesting that differential modulation of ErbB receptors by HDACi is responsible for the observed synergism. We show in two epithelial cells expressing EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 that either vorinostat or VPA time- and dose-dependent down-regulation the of all three receptors expression and signaling. On the contrary, in two A3-resistant mesenchymal cells expressing undetectable levels of ErbB3, we observe time- and dose-dependent increase of mRNA and protein levels as well as surface expression of ErbB3, paralleled by down-regulation of EGFR, ErbB2 and the the mesenchymal marker vimentin. Interestingly, ErbB3 induction was achieved also at low doses of both vorinostat and VPA, corresponding to a plasma level easily reached in patients treated with these agents.Our results suggest that the combination treatment of antibodies against ErbB3 and HDACi represents an attractive strategy that warrant further evaluation, even in combination with other agents, for the treatment of NSCLC patients.']",

        "Background":"['A major contributor to carcinogenesis is the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 regulates the proper folding and stabilization of several client proteins, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). ErbB2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor-proteins, and is a clinical target for the treatment of metastatic cancer, while HIF-1 is often stabilized and overexpressed in several cancers. The ability for Hsp90 to become a mature complex and to properly fold client proteins is dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding with the co-chaperone, p23. Specific Hsp90 inhibitors, like geldanamycin, target the Hsp90 ATP-binding site to prevent formation of the mature complex. Although supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22', '6 n-3) has not been shown to specifically target the Hsp90 ATP-binding site, the current study demonstrates a similar effect by DHA causing a reduction in available intracellular ATP levels. DHA is the longest, most unsaturated omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) existing in biological membranes and has been shown to possess anti-cancer activity in several cancer models. Studies from our laboratory have shown that DHA enrichment can reduce cancer cell metabolism and intracellular ATP levels in both breast and lung cancer models. In this study, a novel mechanism for the ability of DHA to inhibit the Hsp90 chaperone complex is defined. In vitro analyses of BT-474 human breast ductal carcinoma, as well as the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were used to determine the impact of DHA-induced decreases of intracellular ATP levels. We found that the reduction in ATP levels by DHA treatment resulted in significant decreases in the association of Hsp90 and p23 in both cell lines. The decreased association of the Hsp90-p23 complex led to decreased levels of ErbB2 and HIF-1 client proteins, suggesting that DHA can modify Hsp90 chaperone function and attenuate client protein levels. Additionally, similar results were found when employing 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor, which confirms that DHA and 2-DG can disrupt Hsp90 molecular chaperone function by decreasing cellular ATP levels. Consistent with these observations, when using a dose of DHA that did not significantly reduce intracellular ATP levels, no change in the Hsp90-p23 chaperone complex or protein levels of ErbB2 and HIF-1 were seen. These results demonstrate a potential use for dietary intervention to improve cancer therapy in tumors that overexpress Hsp90 client proteins.']",

The experiments were conducted using Kras mutant H460 and A549 cells, and Kras wild type H1650 cells with p53 mutation. Cell survival was measured by clonogenic survival assay (CSA). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression and activity of radiosensitivity related proteins was investigated by RPPA and western blotting. Our results demonstrated that Ganetespib reduced radiation clonogenic survival on lung cancer cells, and greatly attenuated DNA damage repair with irradiation as assessed by P53BP1 foci formation. Cell cycle analysis showed that Ganetespib dramatically increased G2/M arrest between 24-48 hours, which placed cells in the radiosensitive part of the cell cycle, thereby promoting subsequent apoptosis after 48 hours. On RPPA, while higher doses of Ganetespib (50-100 nM) completely attenuated the expression of important client growth factor and survival promoting proteins such as EGFR, Her-2, AKT, and mTOR, and enhanced expressed of apoptotic pathways proteins, radiation dose-dependently acted in concert with low dose Ganetespib to upregulate p21 and downregulate pRb levels that were not apparent with either drug or radiation alone.

Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is important for the multidrug resistance. Among them, ABCB1 and ABCG2 are known to be upregulated in chemoresistant SCLC. We found that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is also upregulated in chemoresistant SBC-3/ETP, SBC-3/SN-38 and SBC-3/CDDP cells, compared to chemosensitive SBC-3 cells. Lapatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2, could not suppress proliferation of these HER2-positive SCLC cells, but successfully restored chemosensitivity to etoposide and SN-38 in SBC-3/ETP and SBC-3/SN-38 cells, respectively. The reversal effect of lapatinib was thought to be caused by inhibition of drug efflux-pump functions of ABC transporters, and was producible with a clinically applicable concentration. Moreover, knocking down of HER2 by a small interfering RNA weakened the effect of lapatinib on ABCB1, indicating the involvement of HER2 in the inhibitory mechanisms. Notably, we demonstrated that caveolin-1 and Src play key roles in modulating ABCB1 function via HER2 inactivation. In SBC-3/ETP cells, dephosphorylation of HER2 by lapatinib activates Src and successively leads to increase caveolin-1 phosphorylation. Through this process, caveolin-1 dissociates from HER2 and strengthens association with ABCB1, and finally impairs the pump functions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment by lapatinib in combination with etoposide or irinotecan significantly suppresses the growth of subcutaneous SBC-3/ETP and SBC-3/SN-38 tumors in mice, respectively.

To date, only a small number of ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations have been reported and biologically characterized. Moreover, the therapeutic impact of ERBB2 or ERBB3 mutant alleles and their value as an actionable target in patients has not been validated. While ERBB2 itself cannot bind ligand, it is a potent receptor that integrates growth signals via homo- or heterodimerization with other ERBB family members.Genomic alterations increase ERBB2 kinase activity by constitutively activating the kinase domain, enabling ligand-independent receptor activation, by promoting enhanced dimerization or other mechanisms that have yet to be elucidated. Although ERBB3 has limited inherent kinase activity and cannot homodimerize, ligand stimulation promotes dimerization with active kinases like ERBB2 and EGFR that can phosphorylate ERBB2 which then promotes transformation.Thus genomic alterations in ERBB3 may be a key means of promoting oncogenic signaling despite the protein lacking robust enzymatic activity. We performed an analysis of 100 large-scale next generation sequencing datasets newly generated by our group (bladder), our institution (MSKCC-IMPACT), or found in recently published repositories (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Broad, Genentech, Sanger, etc) to characterize the distribution and spectrum of mutations in the ERBB2 and ERBB3 genes. Data generated suggests that ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations are highly prevalent in bladder cancer (each 10%), and recurrent, but with less frequency (<5%), in stomach, breast, colon and lung cancers. Hotspots include mutation of S310F and a cluster of residues in the kinase domain in ERBB2 and the V104M mutation in ERBB3. Preliminary analysis of 300 tumors demonstrated that ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations present in a typically in a mutually exclusive pattern suggesting that these may be driver events with overlapping biologic effects. Generation and expression of several of these ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutants induced receptor activation, cell transformation and tumor growth in isogenic cell line and xenograft models. Treatment with the dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, neratinib, in isogenic cell lines abrogated colony formation in soft agar and receptor activation and downstream signaling. We hope to correlate the in vitro potency of specific ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations with drug response in patients on ongoing or future clinical trials of targeted ERBB therapies and determine the whether lineage, subclonality and co-altered genes, if present, predict for drug resistance.']",

Picodroplet-formatted dPCR compartmentalizes the sample (and one or more assay) into a large enough number of discrete reaction volumes (e.g. 10 million) such that there is at most one target molecule per reaction. Standard qPCR reagents (target-specific primers and fluorescent hydrolysis probes) and master mixes are used for endpoint PCR amplification, resulting in plateaued fluorescent signals only in target-containing compartments. This enables digital counting of the absolute number of target molecules present in the sample volume tested.Here we report the use of the RainDrop dPCR system together with multiplexed assays measuring the most common cancer-relevant mutations in EGFR. Multiplexed primer and probe sets were designed for wild-type EGFR, T790M and L858R point mutations, and exon 19 deletions in EGFR. Using spike-in plasmid controls and genomic DNA from lung cancer cell lines (H1975,H1650), we verified simultaneous detection and discrimination of all mutations across a broad dynamic range. Finally, we demonstrated application of the multiplexed EGFR assays on matched tumor and ctDNA samples from lung cancer patients.Sensitive quantification of EGFR mutations in lung cancer patients is critical for stratifying patients into different treatment regimens, and can potentially benefit EGFR mutation-positive patients by allowing dynamic non-invasive tracking of treatment efficacy and clonal evolution. Development of a multiplexed dPCR EGFR mutation assay should facilitate personalizing lung cancer therapy and treatment management, towards the goal of monitoring disease progression for better outcomes. The RainDrop system enables sensitive simultaneous dPCR detection of multiple mutations from the same sample, which is particularly important when available sample is limited, e.g. with tumor biopsies, FFPE samples, circulating tumor cells, and ctDNA in biological fluids.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Third generation epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib (AZD9291) has proven effective in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have developed EGFR T790M-mediated resistance to other EGFR TKIs. Unfortunately, a majority of patients still undergo progressed disease after receiving osimertinib treatment. Acquired EGFR C797S mutation has been identified as one major mechanism; however, resistance mechanisms of remaining cases are still largely unknown. Methods', ' Using next generation sequencing (NGS) targeting 416 cancer-relevant genes, we analyzed the mutation profiles of 99 NSCLC patients that were clinically resistant to osimertinib. Results', ' In addition to the notable EGFR C797 variants (22%), L792 mutations were identified in 10% of patients, and a further 7% cases carry L718 mutations. Further analysis of 14 patients with paired pre-treatment samples confirmed that these EGFR mutations were acquired during treatment. Interestingly, all L792 mutations are in cis with T790M and in trans with C797 mutations (when present in the same patient). 2 out of 10 L792-positive patients and 6 out of 7 L718-positive patients did not have co-existing C797 mutations, suggesting C797-, L792- and L718-mutated cells may represent different resistant clones. In vitro experiments demonstrated that L792 and L718 mutants also increase osimertinib IC50, and therefore confer their resistance. Besides secondary EGFR mutations, alterations in other key genes such as MET, KRAS, ERBB2 and PIK3CA may also contribute to osimertinib resistance. Notably, MET and KRAS amplifications are present only in patients without above EGFR secondary mutations. Conclusions', ' In this study, we identified secondary mutations on C797, L792 or L718 residues of EGFR in 29% of osimertinib-resistant patients. Combined with in vitro study, our data strongly suggest that L792 and L718 mutations are likely to alternatively cause osimertinib resistance. Furthermore, MET and KRAS amplification may serve as bypass resistance mechanisms in patients who are EGFR C797-, L792- and L718-wild type.']",

We correlated DNA methylation status with gene expression and protein expression levels in 31 SCLC and 73 NSCLC lines to identify the relationship of epigenetic with genomic and proteomic features distinguishing SCLC from NSCLC.Results', ' SCLC and NSCLC lines exhibited different methylation profiles and we identified 484 genes that had a significant inverse correlation between methylation status and mRNA expression levels (Rho  -0.5 and FDR = 0.01), (genes regulated by methylation, GRM) that distinguished SCLC from NSCLC. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the 484 genes identified significant associations with neuregulin signaling, immune trafficking, integrin signaling, glioma invasiveness canonical pathways.

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung (HGNEC), including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).Patients and Methods', 'Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research.

        "Background":"['HER2 is modified in approximately 20% of lung cancers and is mutated in approximately 2-3% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several HER2 mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain are activating mutations, and irreversible EGFR TKIs such as afatinib are known to be effective at inhibiting HER2 phosphorylation in tumor cells expressing HER2 activating mutations. However, the clinical use of these second generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors, such as afatinib, has been limited by adverse toxicities such as skin rash and diarrhea. Our recent study in lung cancer showed that ibrutinib, a well-tolerated TKI currently FDA approved for B-cell lymphoma, is capable of inhibiting EGFR. Study by others also demonstrated that ibrutinib can inhibit HER2 phosphorylation in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. In addition, recent studies in other cancers show that the effects of ibrutinib can be amplified in combination of with other small molecule inhibitors targeting AKT and mTOR. Therefore, we hypothesized that HER2 overexpression or activating mutations render NSCLC tumor cells sensitive to ibrutinib. To investigate this, we generated a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines expressing twelve individual clinically observed HER2 mutations and evaluated the transforming capability of the mutations as indicated by sustained cell viability following IL-3 deprivation. Common HER2 mutations such as A775insYVMA, G776del/insVV, and G776C V777insC as well as others were observed to be activating mutations. Mutant HER2 expressing Ba/F3 cells and the human HER2 mutant NSCLC cell line, H1781, were then screened against first, second, and third generation EGFR/HER2 inhibitors including ibrutinib, and cell viability was determined by the Cell Titer Glo assay. Drugs effective in growth inhibition were verified by Western blot analysis. The results showed that EGFR TKI erlotinib and the EGFR/HER2 TKI lapatinib failed to inhibit cell proliferation. However, ibrutinib and third generation EGFR/HER2 TKIs, EGF816 and AZD9291, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis at sub-micromolar concentrations. Western blotting analysis showed dose dependent decreases in phosphorylation of HER2 as well as HER2 downstream signaling molecules such as p-AKT, and p-MAPK. In order to determine if targeting downstream effectors of HER2 in combination with inhibition of the receptor would increase inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, we screened ibrutinib, EGF816 and AZD9291 in combination with both mTOR and AKT inhibitors. There was a modest additive effect when ibrutinib was used in combination with everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, but there was no additive effect of EGF816 or AZD9291 was used in combination with everolimus. These results indicate that EGF816, AZD9291, or ibrutinib alone or in combination with mTOR inhibition may be effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HER2-driven NSCLC.']",

The spectrum of clinical resistance mechanisms and mechanistically appropriate therapeutic strategies to enhance EGFR inhibitor treatment responses remains incompletely defined. Methods', '  We used whole exome and transcriptome deep sequencing analysis of tumors obtained from 16 EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients both prior to EGFR inhibitor therapy and at clinical resistance to identify the spectrum and biological basis of molecular alterations that could drive therapy resistance and be targeted to enhance clinical responses.  Results', '  Tumors with acquired EGFR TKI resistance harbored individual and concurrent established resistance-conferring alterations, including EGFRT790M and upregulation of several receptor kinases, and other molecular alterations not previously associated with this resistance, including activating KRAS mutations.  Pathway analysis of the transcriptome data revealed upregulation of ERBB2 and FGFR signaling broadly in the therapy-resistant tumors and that the EGFRT790M positive resistant tumors exhibited therapy-induced upregulation of biological pathways underlying cell cycle progression and genome maintenance.  The evolution of EGFRT790M-positive resistance was also associated with increased genetic divergence and genomic instability.  Genomic amplification and increased levels of the NF-kB inhibitor NFKBIA correlated with improved EGFR TKI response.  Conclusions', '  This genome-scale characterization of the molecular landscape of EGFR inhibitor resistance uncovered biological programs and molecular events underlying the evolution of resistance, establishes the utility of whole exome and transcriptome deep sequencing in repeat biopsy specimens from NSCLC patients, and provides rationale for serial, comprehensive tumor molecular profiling in individual cancer patients to enhance therapeutic precision and response.

        "Background":"['Detection and chemoprevention of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been unsuccessful in part due to our limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been suggested that normal airway epithelia share molecular abnormalities with tumors and may serve as progenitors for lung malignancies. We sought to analyze molecular profiles of lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), two major subtypes of NSCLC, and matched normal airways to elucidate aberrant expression patterns in early phases of lung tumorigenesis. All specimens were obtained from primary early stage NSCLC consented patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy (n=20). We profiled RNA isolated from tumors and normal lung as well as from brushings of multiple matched airways that were histologically confirmed to lack neoplastic or preneoplastic cells (n=194). Expression signatures signifying genes significantly and concurrently differentially expressed between both tumors and airways compared to normal lung tissue (tumor-airway-normal/TAN signatures) were then derived independently for SCC and smoker adenocarcinoma cases and were comprised of 1,803 and 1,938 genes, respectively. The TAN signatures effectively clustered tumor and airways from normal lung samples (p<0.001). Further analysis showed that a subset of the genes separated SCC- and adenocarcinoma-adjacent airways. Moreover, pathways and gene-network analysis using Ingenuity pathways software highlighted similarities and differences in pathway modulation between airway epithelial fields of SCCs and adenocarcinomas. Embryonic stem cell and eicosanoid signaling pathways were most significantly modulated among those common to both TAN signatures (p<0.001). Retinoic acid receptor and stem cell signaling pathways mediated by NANOG and lineage oncogene SOX2 were most significantly modulated in the SCC TAN signature, whereas NF-kB and PTEN signaling pathways were most prevalent in the adenocarcinoma TAN airway signature (all p<0.001). Gene networks mediated by lineage oncogene NKX2-1/TITF-1 down-regulation and TP63 up-regulation, and networks mediated by increased expression of the MET and ERBB2 oncogenes were predominantly functionally modulated in the SCC and adenocarcinoma TAN signatures, respectively. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed up-regulation of MET in adenocarcinomas and normal airways compared to normal lung. These findings highlight expression patterns and pathways that are deregulated differentially in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinomas and SCCs and thus offer detection markers as well as therapeutic targets to guide personalized chemoprevention in early stage NSCLC patients.

Comprehensive NGS testing was performed in 15%, with additional 18% undergoing limited genotyping beyond EGFR/ALK. Rates of comprehensive NGS increased (2013', ' 10%, 2015', ' 23%; p < 0.001). Similar rates of NGS testing were observed among oncologists caring for > 10 pts or < 10 pts (15% vs 16%). 31 pts (5%) underwent second biopsy to obtain tissue for genotyping. Insufficient tissue was cited by 8%, with other documentation for non-testing lacking. Actionable EGFR/ALK findings were identified in 107 pts (22% tested); 73% of these received TT; 6% started chemo prior to test results (median 26 days vs 22 days who received TT; p = 0.36); 10% no treatment (7% early deaths). Genotyping identified actionable mut in 17 pts (2.6% overall population); (9 MET Amp/ 88 tested, 2 BRAF/98 tested, 2 ERBB2/ 52 tested, 2 RET/ 82 tested, 1 ROS1/ 85 tested, 1 MET Exon 14/ 46 tested). Among these 17 pts only 1 received TT (herceptin). Conclusions', ' Genotyping for EGFR/ALK remain below guidelines; most patients are undergenotyped for all 7 treatable mut. NGS testing rates are slowly increasing, which may reduce insufficient tissue exclusions. We plan to explore whether non-invasive comprehensive genotyping with cell-free DNA NGS may increase utilization of TT.']",

EGFR can be a partner of heterodimer of other EGFR family such as HER2 and HER3. EGFR is often overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Anti-EGFR agents including EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have considered to be effective for NSCLC when drug sensitive EGFR mutation is present. However, inherent and acquired resistances are major problems of EGFR targeting therapies. In this study, we knock-downed EGFR using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in NSCLC cell lines to examine the significance of targeting EGFR for NSCLC therapy. Materials and methods', ' We treated 14 NSCLC cell lines including nine EGFR mutant and five EGFR wild-type cell lines by geftinib or siRNAs for EGFR knock-down (siR-EGFR). Three cell line, PC-9-GR-N1, RPC-9, and HCC827-Met, were experimentally established as acquired resistant cells to gefitinib. The anti-tumor effect was determined by MTS or colony formation assay. The protein expression was evaluated using Western blotting. Results', ' All cell lines showed the expression of EGFR protein and siR-EGFR treatment down-regulated EGFR protein in all 14 cell lines. siR-EGFR suppressed cell viability in 7 of 9 EGFR mutant cells ranged from 8.0% to 73%.

Cell viability of all EGFR wild-type cells was not inhibited except NCI-H411. Conclusion', ' Our results indicated that EGFR can be the therapeutic target of NSCLC with EGFR activation.

Astsaturov and colleagues (2010) employed a synthetic lethal screening method and have reported that the combined inhibition of the EGFR and Aurora A kinase pathways had synergistic effect on cancer cell viability in head and neck and colon cancer cell lines suggesting a potential benefit of such combination therapy in patients. Our study aims to examine the effects of combination of erlotinib (E), an EGFR small-molecule inhibitor, and Alisertib (MLN8237, A), an inhibitor of Aurora A kinase, in lung cancer models. Treatment of two human NSCLC cell lines, A549 and H322M, with E+A showed synergistic activity in vitro. These cell lines were chosen for the xenografts studies in CB17 SCID mice. After tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3, mice were treated with E+A for three weeks. The xenografts were sensitive to growth inhibition by E (10 mg/kg/day) and A (20 mg/kg/twice daily) alone and the combination had an additive effect. In order to understand early cell signaling events in tumors treated with these agents we repeated the xenograft experiment by treating mice with a one time dosing of each drug alone and in combination. Three tumors per group were collected at 0 , 6 , 24 , or 48 hours after treatment and a panel of signaling molecules downstream of the EGFR and Aurora A kinase pathways were examined by Western blot. These included EGFR/pEGFR; HER2; HER3; MEK/pMEK; ERK/pERK; Src/pSrc and Akt/pAkt among others. Our results suggest that combined inhibition of both pathways in lung cancer cell lines and xenografts can lead to a reduced proliferative index as indicated by quantitative changes in these proteins and that this combination might be effective as a treatment strategy.

However despite the high response rates to these agents, acquired resistance to ALK TKI therapy remains a significant barrier to overcome in order to maximize therapeutic responses in patients with ALK+ lung cancer. In crizotinib-resistant tumors, EGFR activation has been demonstrated to mediate acquired resistance in several independent studies. The tumor suppressor gene product MIG-6 (encoded by ERFFI1) acts as a natural inhibitor of signaling through EGFR (ErbB1) and other ErbB family members. However, a role for MIG-6 in ALK+ lung cancer has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigated the regulation of human MIG-6 in ALK+ lung cancer cells.DESIGN', ' MIG-6 expression, protein interaction and phosphorylation status were evaluated in ALK+ lung cancer cell lines and human tumor samples. The impact of MIG-6 loss and gain of function on ErbB receptor activity and on cell proliferation/survival were determined in several models of TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant ALK+ lung cancer.RESULTS', ' MIG-6 protein level is regulated by EML4-ALK fusion protein at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Genetic or pharmacologic knock-down of ALK significantly reduced MIG-6 protein levels in ALK+/TKI sensitive cells. We established a novel interaction between MIG-6 and ALK fusion proteins (both EML4-ALK and other fusion partners), and this association was dependent on ALK kinase activity. MIG-6 can also be tyrosine-phosphorylated by EML4-ALK and be threonine-phosphorylated through EML4-ALK-dependent MAPK activation. The reduced MIG-6 protein level was accompanied by increased total and phosphorylated ErbB family members (EGFR, HER2, and HER3) in ALK+/TKI sensitive lung cancer cells. Consistent with this observation, MIG-6 protein level is also attenuated in ALK+/TKI resistant cells, following the decreased EML4-ALK activity, while EGFR signaling activity is remarkably up-regulated in these resistant cells. Crizotinib-resistant cells were re-sensitized upon exposure to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors in combination with crizotinib. In addition, MIG-6 reconstitution impeded the development of early adaptive resistance in crizotinib-sensitive cells and was also able to inhibit the proliferation of crizotinib-resistant cells.CONCLUSION', ' Our study presents an in-depth mechanistic understanding of how ErbB family members, such as EGFR, are up-regulated at the time of crizotinib resistance and provides insights into the early escape mechanisms tumor may have to evade ALK TKI therapy.']",

Here, we present the development of a new, freely available online tool suitable for the real-time meta-analysis of published lung cancer microarray datasets to validate expression based survival related biomarker candidates.First we have searched the caBIG, GEO and TCGA repositories to identify datasets with published gene expression data and survival information. In this, three GEO platforms (GPL96, GPL570 and GPL3921) were considered as these possess 22,277 common probes, which were used for constructing the database. All together 1,329 NSCLC samples in 9 independent datasets were identified, 85% have overall survival and 45% progression free survival info, one-third adenocarcinomas and one-third squamous cell carcinomas, 57% male and the average overall survival is 45 months. Kaplan-Meier survival plot, and the hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals and logrank P value are calculated and plotted in R using Bioconductor packages. To assess the prognostic value of a gene, each percentile (of expression) between the lower and upper quartiles are computed and the best performing threshold is used as the final cutoff in a Cox regression analysis. The complete meta-analysis tool can be accessed online at', ' www.kmplot.com/lung.We demonstrate the application of this integrative analysis pipeline by validating 22 previously published survival associated biomarkers including VEGF, ADAM28, ANXA3, CADM1, CD24, CD82, CDK1, CEA, cyclin E, ERCC1, EZH2, HER2, IFNAR2, MMP9, OPN, P16, p53R2, RAD51, S100A4, survivin, XAF1 and XIAP.

Methods', ' In a prospectively designed program, to date, we have recruited 227 advanced NSCLC patients having received prior therapy, with unknown molecular profile at time of blood collection.

Current tissue of origin (TOO) methods use protein or RNA-based expression signatures, are costly, and often provide little clinically relevant information. We previously showed that use of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) identifies a clinically relevant genomic alteration in 96% of CUPs. We hypothesized that CGP could also potentially identify a TOO for some CUP patients, further refining potential targeted therapeutic options. Methods', ' DNA alterations from 44,065 samples that underwent CGP as part of standard clinical care were classified using logistic regression based on mutational profiles and select clinical features. Results', ' We first trained a logistic regression classifier to identify non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with alterations in EGFR, ERBB2, BRAF, MET, KRAS, ALK, RET, or ROS1 (lung gene set). In cross-validation, the classifier correctly identified 79% of NSCLCs (92% of EGFR mutant samples) and 93% of non-NSCLCs. When applied to a set of 1352 CUPs with an alteration in the lung gene set, 425 (31%) were predicted to be NSCLC. We next trained a classifier to distinguish BRAF V600-mutant colorectal cancers (CRCs) from other BRAF V600-mutant cancers. The classifier correctly identified 90% of CRCs and 93% of non-CRC. Use of this classifier with a BRAF-mutant CUP data set predicted 32/87 (37%) of BRAF-mutant CUP tumors to be CRC. Conclusions', ' In a large series of CUP patients with alterations in the lung gene set, one-third were likely NSCLC, and could potentially benefit from approved targeted therapies in this disease. When applied to BRAF V600-mutant CUPs, 37% were predicted to be CRC, and therefore single agent vemurafenib therapy is unlikely to be effective and combination therapy indicated. This approach is useful for identifying targeted therapeutics likely to be effective based on molecular match and TOO. We plan to extend this DNA-based tool to 4 additional tumor types. Application of this classifier to CUPs may help identify therapeutic strategies from CGP without the need for additional material or testing.']",

Clinical data were extracted from the medical records of patients with PIK3CA mutant tumors.  Results', '  25 of 1325 (2%, 95% CI 1-3%) patients had a mutation in PIK3CA (11 E545K, 3 E542K, 3 H1047L, 8 H1047R).

Stable disease was the response in the patient with EML4-ALK given crizotinib.  Conclusions', '   We found PIK3CA mutations in all histologic types of non-small cell lung cancer. They are not mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and EML4-ALK.  Data on the impact of PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of targeted therapies (erlotinib, crizotinib) are scant.

        "Background":"['The development of targeted therapies that efficiently inhibit cancer signaling pathways is one of the main goals of modern precision cancer medicine. Consequently, genetic and biological phenotypic data of in vitro screens are increasingly utilized to develop compounds directed against distinct oncogenic alterations. However, current targeted therapies are often limited to small genetically defined patient cohorts due to the very finite number of proteins amenable to direct chemical inhibition. An alternative approach is the exploitation of synthetic lethality, i.e. inhibition of an unaltered protein required for cell viability in a certain genetic background. Systematic chemo-genomic analyses of cancer cell lines have been shown to be suitable tools for the identification of novel synthetic lethal dependencies in cancer (Chan et al. Sci Trans Med, 2011; Sos et al. PNAS, 2012; Kim et al. Cell 2013).To systematically extend this strategy to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) we characterized the efficacy of 1505 chemical compounds based on a variety of kinase inhibitor motifs in a high-throughput screen against 80 NSCLC cell lines. We extracted patterns of biological activity based on chemical and genetic information and found that potency and selectivity of compounds are strongly related to their molecular scaffold, but independent of their overall chemical complexity. We thereby discovered a sunitinib derivative that exhibited exquisite activity against ERBB2-mutant cell lines but was devoid of ERBB2 kinase activity. Instead a kinome scan and an shRNA screen suggested a mechanism of synthetic lethality by activity against NTRK family members. Moreover a CDK9 inhibitor was identified as selective and potent against a midline carcinoma cell line - a tumor entity characterized by recurrent BRD4-NUT gene fusions. Using additional cell lines we validated the upregulation of c-Fos and selective induction of apoptosis in BRD4-NUT positive midline carcinoma compared to control cell lines following CDK9 inhibition. This can augment existing therapeutic approaches, which have primarily focused on directly targeting the fusion product with bromodomain inhibitors, and offers a novel target in this entity.In conclusion, by systematically screening a large number of compounds against a panel of genetically well characterized NSCLC cell lines and incorporating chemical information we were able to derive structure activity relationships and to identify potential synthetically lethal targets in two genetic entities in clinical need of advanced selective therapies.']",

Presence of activating mutations, gene fusions or copy number amplification of many of these kinases predict responsiveness to specific inhibitors, for example, imatinib for BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, trastuzumab and lapatinib for ERBB2-amplified breast cancers, gefitinib for lung cancers with kinase domain mutations in EGFR, and crizotinib for lung cancers with ALK gene fusions. However, tumors with defined kinase aberrations represent a very small proportion of all cancers, and we hypothesize that potentially most, if not all, cancers are dependent on specific kinases, and that Outlier Expression of specific kinases in individual samples may be indicative of selection during clonal evolution, and thus may represent a therapeutic avenue. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data from a compendium of 482 cancer and benign samples belonging to 25 different tissue types to define sample-specific kinome expression profiles. Comparing the expression of kinases within a sample and across sample sets, we identified distinct outlier kinases in individual samples, defined as genes showing the highest statistically significant levels of absolute and differential expression. Frequently observed outlier kinases included known therapeutic targets like ERBB2 and FGFR4 in breast cancer, distinct from MET, AKT2, and PLK2 in pancreatic cancer. Outlier kinases imparted sample-specific dependencies in various cell lines as assessed by siRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Outlier expression of polo-like kinases (PLKs) observed in a subset of KRAS-dependent pancreatic cancer cell lines conferred increased sensitivity to the PLK inhibitor BI 6727. Together, our results suggest that outlier kinases represent effective personalized therapeutic targets that are readily identifiable through RNA-sequencing of tumors. Next, to help translate these observations into treatment options, we are attempting to establish 3D tumoroid cultures from tumor samples that can be used to optimize combinations of therapeutics including outlier kinase inhibitors.']",

Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected at various time points to assess levels of erlotinib. We found that CSF concentrations of erlotinib were generally 2% that of plasma concentrations. Among the five patients examined, CSF concentrations of erlotinib reached up to 131 nM when high doses were administered at 600 to 1200 mg every four to six days. Additionally, drug clearance was decreased with an increased dosing regimen in one of the patients. In one patient, the area under the curve (AUC) estimations showed a 24% increase in the CSF versus only a 2% increase in the plasma following an increase from 150 mg to 600 mg of erlotinib. Moreover, longitudinal CSF samples were evaluated for expression and activation of EGFR as well as various other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as ErbB2, ErbB3, cMET and IGF1R, using the highly sensitive multiplexed immunoassay CEER platform. The latter provides insight into the molecular makeup of the CNS cancer throughout the therapeutic regimen.Our clinical data on patients receiving erlotinib therapy for primary and metastatic CNS disease suggests that increased dosing of erlotinib, administered as a pulse dose every four to six days leads to increased CSF drug concentrations. In spite of the variations seen among different patients, we conclude that higher erlotinib dosing regimens can provide enhanced CNS penetration that may prove to be more effective in primary and metastatic CNS cancers especially when coupled with real-time molecular monitoring of the disease to help guide the clinician during the course of treatment.']",

This disparity remains even with advances in treatments targeting specific driver mutations that have improved outcomes for some patients. Although the relative frequency of these genetic alterations varies in subsets of individuals defined by sex, histologic subtype, smoking history and race, little is known about the occurrence of these mutations in African Americans. In this study, we characterize the spectrum of known driver mutations in 200 African American NSCLC patients and seek to identify novel somatic mutations in this population. Initially, the population was screened using the Sequenom LungCarta panel of 216 mutations in 24 genes known to contain alterations associated with lung cancer, RET and ROS1 fusion gene expression, and amplification of FGFR1. Whole-exome sequencing is being performed on tumors from those patients with no known somatic mutations. Paired normal and tumor DNA/RNA samples are being genotyped to distinguish germline from somatic mutations in both the screening and sequencing phases. Initial screening has been completed on 130 patients, with the remaining 70 underway. The mean age of the patients enrolled is 61.7 years, 58.5% are female, and 8.5% are never smokers. In profiling the first 130 African American patients, we find that only 28% of patients (N = 36) carry a known somatic mutation that is not present in the germline, far lower than the 41% reported in white patients in our previous studies. Of the identified mutations, approximately 23.8% are KRAS and 23.8% are PT53 alterations. The next most frequent somatic alterations are in EGFR (16.7%). The remaining alterations occurred in only 1 or 2 tumors and include EPHA3, ERBB2, FGFR1, MET, NOTCH1, NRAS, NTRK2, PIK3CA, PTEN, RET and STK11. Five percent of patients have tumors with two driver mutations. Half of the tumors carrying 2 driver mutations had concurrent alterations in KRAS and TP53. Patients with known genetic alterations were more likely to be female than patients with no known genetic alterations (p = 0.42), but did not differ in age, smoking status, pack-years, family history of lung cancer, history of COPD, stage at diagnosis or histology. Mutations in EGFR were responsible for the differences by sex. Exome sequencing is complete for the first 48 of the 92 patients with no known somatic mutations. Sequences are being aligned using Novoalign and GATK will be used for variant calling; results will be available soon.

Here we address the question, whether there are further interesting candidates besides the antigens MAGE-A3 and hTERT that induce intensive immune reactions in a high frequency in lung cancer and are therefore eligible for immunotherapeutic approaches.  Methods', '  Immune reactions of CD8+ T-cells were measured in ELISPOT assays for IFN-gamma and granzyme B. Moreover, tetramer assays and chromium release assays were performed. Epitopes were tested derived from the lung-cancer associated antigens MAGE-A3 and hTERT, and from the antigens RHAMM, Survivin, WT-1, PRAME, HER2 and G250 known from other tumor entities as well as novel antigens, like Aurorakinases A and B. For these novel antigens more than 10 HLA-A2-binding peptides were predicted and tested in 20 healthy volunteers and 15 lung cancer patients.  Results', '  Specific T-cell responses could be detected against at least one peptide in all patients. Most frequent responses were detected against PRAME (67%), hTERT (60%), G250 (60%) and RHAMM (40%). Lower frequency was measured for Survivin- (27%), WT-1- (27%), the two MAGE-A3- (27 and 20%) and Her2- (15%) derived peptides. Specific T-cell responses could be also detected against Aurorakinases A and B. The novel peptides AuraA01 and AuraB01 showed specific T-cell responses in 33% and 40% of patients respectively. Serological immune responses are under investigation.  Conclusions', '  Specific T-cell responses against several TAA could be detected for the antigens hTERT, PRAME, G250 and RHAMM in a high frequency of patients with lung cancer, but also in a lower frequency against several other antigen peptides. Moreover, novel immunogenic targets like Aurorakinases were identified. Therefore, further antigen structures are appropriate for immuno-targeted approaches in lung cancer.']",

        "Background":"[\"Globally, about 53% of lung cancer cases in women and 15% of lung cancer cases in men are not attributable to active tobacco use, making lung cancer in never smokers the seventh leading cause of cancer death. Experimental and epidemiological evidence suggest that lung cancer in never smokers has unique risk factors, clinical features, and histological distributions as compared to those lung cancer cases attributed to tobacco smoking. In general, lung cancer in never smokers presents predominately as adenocarcinoma and in females. The lung cancer rate among females in Xuanwei, China is among the highest in the world for nonsmoking females, and has been attributed to indoor air pollution from domestic fuel combustion, particularly from bituminous coal. To further explore the clinical and histological aspects of lung cancer in Xuanwei, we collected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from a series of 76 female lung cancer cases. The mean age of the patients was 47.7 years old (9.2 years). Expert consensus review found 54 (71%) of the female lung cancer cases were adenocarcinomas (ADCs), 11 (14.5%) were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 1 (1.3%) was an adenosquamous carcinoma (ADSC), 8 (10.5%) were large cell carcinomas, and 2 (2.7%) were other subtypes. We then used two multiplexed assays to detect in DNA from FFPE tissue more than 40 recurrent mutations in nine genes relevant to existing and emerging targeted lung cancer therapies among subjects who were confirmed never smoking female lung cancer cases (32 ADCs, 7 SCCs, 1 ADSC). These assays include amplification of DNA through Applied Biosystem's SNaPshot technology to detect 38 different recurrent somatic point mutations in 8 driver genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, AKT1, and PTEN) and a PCR-based sizing assay that assesses for EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 20 insertions, and HER2 exon 20 insertions. We detected 15 EGFR mutations [E20-6bp-ins. (n=1); EGFR_19-15bpDel (n=4); EGFR_G719A_2156G>C (n=2); EGFR_G719C_2155G>T (n=3); EGFR_G719S _2155G>T (n=1); EGFR_G719S_2155G>A (n=1); EGFR_L858R_2573T>G (n=2); EGFR L861Q_2582T>A (n=1)] in 12 ADCs and 2 SCCs. Six KRAS mutations, all of which were KRAS G12C_34G>T, were detected in 5 ADCs and 1 SCC. EGFR and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive and no mutations were observed for BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, HER2, AKT1, or PTEN. The high percentage of samples with KRAS mutations (15.0% overall; 15.6% ADCs; 14.3% SCCs) in our series is of interest, primarily because KRAS mutations are reportedly more rare in other populations from Asia (5%) and populations of never smokers from Asia (2%). Given that all subjects with KRAS mutations burned coal indoors for heating and cooking, our findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of lung cancer among never smoking females exposed to indoor air pollution from coal.\"]",

Results', ' Following signed patient consent, a series of lung cancer patient samples were examined using NEOliquid or NEOplus analysis. The spectrum of actionable genomic alterations that were detected, included oncogenic alterations (e.g. ARAF p.S214F, MET exon 14 skipping, BRAF p.N486_A489 deletion, microsatellite instability detection), resistance mutations (e.g. EGFR p.T790M), gene fusions (e.g. ALK-CARS, EML4-ALK, EGFR-KDD), and copy number alterations (e.g. ERBB2 amplifications) These cases are presented in their clinical context and treatment recommendations and outcome are discussed. Conclusions', ' Using the NEOplus and NEOliquid assays, we have identified a broad spectrum of therapeutically relevant genomic alterations with high sensitivity and specificity that resulted in concrete therapeutic recommendations.

        "Background":"['Identification of soluble biomarkers has become a critical non-invasive approach for disease diagnosis and monitoring in the treatment of solid tumors. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all lung cancers worldwide. The EGFR family of genes is known to be highly expressed in NSCLC tumors and play a critical role in the progression of the disease. Although patients initially respond well to EGFR TKI therapy, acquired resistance occurs through several mechanisms, including compensatory cMET pathway activation (Robinson et al. 2013). Previous reports have demonstrated that soluble forms of EGFR, Her2 and cMET are generated through either alternate splicing of mRNA or proteolytic cleavage of the full length receptors (Wilken et al. 2013). Serum concentrations of these receptors can be correlated with prognosis as well as treatment response (Gregorc, 2004, Kasahara, 2010 Heinmoller, 2003). Soluble receptor ligands, including Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), have also been evaluated in NSCLC and a strong correlation has also been observed between the levels of serum HGF and disease outcome in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs (Kasahara et al. 2010).In this study, we evaluated concentrations of sEGFR, sMET, sHER2,, and HGF in NSCLC versus healthy normal serum samples via meso scale discovery (MSD) platform. Inventoried and custom MSD assays were optimized to measure these proteins in a training set consisting of 19 NSCLC and 16 normal healthy serum samples. Significantly lower concentrations of sEGFR and sHER2 were observed in the NSCLC serum samples compared to normal (p value = 0.0092 for both receptors), whereas, in contrast, the levels of HGF were significantly higher in the NSCLC patient samples (p value <0.0001). No significant difference in sMET concentration was observed between NSCLC and normal serum. Based on this data, it was determined that a ratio of protein concentration of each soluble receptor (EGFR, Her2 and cMET) to HGF yielded a greater differentiation between NSCLC and normal samples (p value <0.0001, = 0.0041,and 0.0327 respectively). Cut-off values to define NSCLC versus normal patients were established for each ratio and validated in a blinded independent cohort, consisting of 50 NSCLC and 12 healthy normal serum samples. PPV and NPV were then calculated to determine sensitivity and specificity for each protein ratio. Results from the validation study show an almost complete separation between healthy and NSCLC patient samples (p value <0.0001, AUC = 1)for all three ratios tested (sEGFR/HGF, sHER2/HGF and sMET/HGF), with a PPV = 100%, 98%, 100% and NPV = 100%, 100%, 85.7%, respectively.

        "Background":"['Breast cancer remains a significant public health issue in the industrialized countries. Physicians depend on surgery, cytotoxic adjuvant chemotherapy, or radiation for treatment of breast cancer patients. Few novel therapies are approved for clinical use. Although existing therapies are effective in controling the disease in many patients, the cytotoxic side-effects make them limited. This is especially the case in the patients with early stage breast cancer whose prognosis with surgery alone is good and avoiding adjuvant chemotherapy would spare them toxic side effects. On the other hand, significant fraction of patients relapses and develops metastasis. Therefore, it is critical to identify markers for better breast cancer patient stratification based on their prognosis that would guide physicians in selection and aggressiveness of therapies. Recently, we linked transcription factor DMP1 (cyclin D binding protein 1, Dmtf1) as a critical tumor suppressor that blocks proliferative signals from ErbB2 and oncogenic Ras by activating p14Arf-p53 pathway. hDMP1 is hemizygously deleted in 50% of human breast tumors that retain wild-type ARF and p53. In this study we identified an upstream kinase, MEKK1, which cooperates with Dmp1 to activate Arf transcription. In constitutively active form (C-terminal kinase domain or CA-MEKK1), MEKK1 increased transcriptional activity of Dmp1 via direct phosphorylation, while the full length (regulatory and kinase domain) form behaved as a feedback inhibitor by increasing Dmp1 ubiquitination. Phosphorylation sites on DMP1 that increase its transcriptional activity were mapped to the C-terminal transactivation domain. Expression of CA-MEKK1 in breast cancer cell lines activated endogenous Arf-p53 pathway. hMEKK1 is located on human 5q11 chromosome, a locus frequently deleted in breast and lung cancer. Since MEKK1 appeared to be an activator of p53 tumor suppressor pathway, we wondered if MEKK1 is involved in human cancer. Using DNA from breast cancer patient tumors and matched normal tissue, we analyzed hMEKK1 gene deletion using specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) primers. MEKK1 was found hemizygously deleted in 20% of patients. Immunohistochemistry confirmed reduction of MEKK1 protein intensity to LOH(+) compared to LOH (-) patients. In the independent cohort of breast cancer patients, we show that low MEKK1 mRNA expression is associated with adverse outcome. Here we show that constitutively active MEKK1 is a novel activator of Dmp1-Arf-p53 pathway via Dmp1 phosphorylation. The MEKK1 gene was frequently deleted in breast tumor tissue and its expression was correlated with disease outcome. Overall, MEKK1 is a potential prognostic/predictive indicator for breast cancer and could be used by physicians to better stratify patients.']",

Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gene fusions exist across a multitude of tumor types and that known fusions are not always confined to the disease in which they appear most often.

To date, comprehensive molecular profiling to identify actionable modifiers of EGFR TKI response has not been conducted in NSCLC p on therapy.    Methods', '  We performed next generation sequencing (NGS) using a 263-gene Nimblegen custom cancer panel on DNA isolated from primary patient lung adenocarcinoma FFPE specimens prior to initiating standard erlotinib treatment and upon the development of acquired erlotinib resistance after only 3 months of therapy.   Results', '  In the pretreatment sample, we confirmed the presence of the EGFRL858R mutation in 95% of the sequencing reads and discovered a concurrent BRAF V600E mutation with a frequency of ~ 6%. NGS performed on the acquired erlotinib resistance sample revealed acquisition of the EGFR T790M mutation with a frequency of ~ 14%. Notably, the frequency of the BRAF V600E mutation increased 10-fold upon acquired erlotinib resistance from ~ 6% in the pretreatment tumor to ~ 60% in the recurrent tumor.  We found that overexpression of BRAF V600E in H3255 human NSCLC, which harbor EGFR L858R (but not BRAF V600E) and are erlotinib sensitive, caused resistance to erlotinib treatment (10-fold increase in erlotinib IC50).  BRAF V600E-mediated erlotinib resistance was reversed by treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Additional functional studies are ongoing and the complete dataset will be presented.  Conclusions', '  These results indicate that EGFR-mutant NSCLC can harbor additional oncogenic driver mutations in BRAF at low frequencies prior to therapy.  EGFR TKI treatment can lead to expansion of BRAF V600E expressing tumor cells, resulting in acquired EGFR TKI resistance that can be reversed by BRAF inhibitor treatment.

ErbB dimerization results in the phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues, activating diverse signaling pathways. These downstream pathways culminate in a variety of cellular responses, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and migration. In addition, interactions between ErbB receptors provide a mechanism for signal differentiation and amplification. Dysregulation of ErbB mediated signaling confers a growth advantage, and can result in cellular transformation and/or increased tumor metastatic potential. ErbB family members have been well validated cancer targets. Both antibodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting individual ErbB receptors or both ErbB1/ErbB2 together have been approved for the treatment of human cancers. In addition, some ErbB targeting agents are in late stages of clinical testing.A large fraction of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, the most common and malignant primary brain tumor) harbors EGFRvIII activating mutation, and may represent an especially appropriate subgroup of this cancer for treatment with ErbB inhibitors.Results', ' NT113 is a potent and selective pan-ErbB family kinase inhibitor.

If these PK results are maintained in human patients, it may lead to significant clinical activity. Longer half life would allow the drug to better permeate into tumor, while the brain penetrance is favorable for insuring the clinical activity of NT113 for CNS cancer, as well as for brain metastasis of NSCLC and breast cancers.In vivo, NT113 displayed excellent activities in NT87 gastric cancer xenograft models, and in NCI-H1975 (T790M gate keeper mutation) NSCLC xenograft models.

Mutations in EGFR, HER2 and BRAF, specific translocations of ALK, ROS1, RET and amplification of MET all have standard diagnostic importance and lead to specific treatment options for the individual LAC patients. Recently, in 2-4% of LAC MET gene mutations leading to skipping of exon 14 were found. These mutations were described to occur more frequently in tumors with sarcomatoid histology. LAC with MET exon 14 skipping mutations showed impressive, although temporary, responses to MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) crizotinib, cabozantinib and capmatinib. We will present our experience with routine molecular diagnostic detection of the most common MET exon 14 skipping mutations. Methods', ' In January 2016 we included in our standard, DNA based, molecular diagnostics custom-made NGS analyses 4 amplicons for detection of MET skipping mutations. The analyses were performed on microdissected FFPE tissue sections or routine histology or cytology stained preparations.

Median turn around time for SS results was 20 days. 48% of samples were positive for a mutation or translocation, including 25% KRAS, 13% EGFR, 5% ALK, 5% TP53, 4% PIK3CA, 2% beta-catenin, 1% BRAF, 1% NRAS, and 1 pt each with HER2 and IDH1. Beta-catenin tended to co-exist with other mutations, including EGFR and PIK3CA. EGFR, ALK and BRAF mutations were associated with low smoking; KRAS and NRAS with heavy smoking. EGFR and KRAS were more common in adenocarcinoma; PIK3CA was associated with squamous cell histology. ALK was associated with younger age and KRAS with earlier stage. Overall, 15% of pts with advanced or recurrent NSCLC during the trial period enrolled on a clinical study of a targeted agent as a result of their genotype and an additional 4% went on an EGFR TKI off-protocol due to SS results. Tumor staging dilemmas were clarified via SS analysis of multiple biopsies in 6 cases.   Conclusions', '   Broad cancer genotyping is increasingly important in NSCLC. In our cohort, about half of pts had an identifiable mutation or translocation. We demonstrated that SS testing is feasible in a clinical setting, and can influence treatment options.']",

However, despite significant improvements in treatment outcomes, both inherent and acquired resistance are frequently encountered problems. Emerging evidence from early phase neo-adjuvant clinical trials, such as Neo-sphere and Neo-ALTTO, suggests that targeting multiple members of the Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family is more efficacious than single target inhibition. AZD 8931 is a novel equipotent reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR, HER-2 and HER-3 signalling with proven pre-clinical efficacy in breast, head and neck and non-small cell lung cancers {1}.To investigate potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to AZD-8931, HER-2 amplified SKBR-3 breast cancer cells were rendered resistant by culture with escalating doses of drug. Resistant and parental cell lines were phenotypically distinct with resistance being associated with greater cell spreading and increased cell density. Cross resistance to lapatinib, a reversible dual EGFR/HER 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was demonstrated with an over 50 fold increase in IC50. Signalling changes associated with a resistant phenotype were explored with a combination of Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) and western blotting. Following drug treatment, resistant cells still displayed a dose-dependent reduction in phospho HER-2 (Tyr 1248)/EGFR (Tyr 1173). However, constitutive activation of the HER 3 pathway resulted in persistent downstream signalling via the PI3K/AKT pathway and increased cell survival.Tumorigenesis in the MMTV-Nic model is driven by mammary-specific expression of a constitutively active HER 2 transgene {2}. This model has been crossed with a strain with a floxed PTEN allele {2} and studies are currently under way to explore the role of PTEN in AZD-8931 resistance.']",

Erlotinib (E) inhibits HER1 tyrosine kinase signalling and is widely registered for treatment of relapsed NSCLC. By inhibiting extracellular receptor dimerisation, as well as internal signal transduction through HER1, the combination of E and P would be expected to result in extensive blockade of HER signalling. Preclinical and initial response data seem to confirm this (Felip et al. ESMO 2008, abs 269P). Methods', ' 15 pts in 2 cohorts were treated in this Phase I, dose-escalating study.

However, resistance to EGFRi occurs in the majority of patients with the main clinical drivers being secondary gatekeeper mutations (T790M) or amplification of genes such as c-MET and Her2.The small animal radiation research platform (SARRP), which allows the treatment of rodent models of cancer more accurately with planned protocols similar to those utilised in the clinic, was used in combination with EGFRi, to assess the efficacy of combination treatment strategies of irradiation (IR) in EGFRi resistant NSCLC xenografts.METHODS', ' Resistance to EGFRi in the NSCLC cell line HCC827, which harbours an activating EGFR mutation, was generated through repeated exposure to Gefitinib or Erlotinib. Resistant models were characterised for further mutations in the EGFR gene by direct sequencing and for c-MET, Axl and Her2 over-expression/genomic amplification by quantitative PCR.EGFRi resistant or parental HCC827 cells were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice, xenograft growth was monitored by calliper measurements and treatment initiated when the mean tumour volume reached 200mm3. An image guided IR dose of 3Gy/mouse/day (30Gy total) was targeted directly to the xenografts whilst sparing the surrounding normal tissue. Mice were treated with IR either alone or in combination with Erlotinib or Crizotinib; response to treatment was evaluated by tumour volume measurement.RESULTS', ' EGFR-TKI resistant HCC827 cell lines were generated following successive cycles of treatment. Amplification of c-MET was identified in a number of clones, but no Her2 amplification or gatekeeper mutations; therefore Crizotinib, a c-MET inhibitor, was selected for evaluation in these models.When assessed in vivo, treatment of parental HCC827 xenografts with targeted IR or Erlotinib treatment resulted in tumour regression. However, in the c-MET driven resistant model, both the IR and Erlotinib response was significantly attenuated, resulting in tumour re-growth. Combination testing with Crizotinib restored the efficacy of both IR and Erlotinib to nave treatment levels confirming the role of c-MET in resistance.CONCLUSIONS', ' Resistance to EGFRi and IR in a HCC827 model is driven by c-MET amplification.

An innovative trial that facilitates drug access, whilst systematically analyzing treatment outcomes and biomarkers, could help overcome these challenges. Methods', ' We designed a prospective, non randomized clinical trial in which patients with advanced cancer are treated with targeted or immunotherapy matched to their tumor profile, defined by genetic aberration, microsatellite instability (MSI) or high mutational load (HML). Upon a mandatory pre-treatment tumor biopsy for biomarker research, patients are enrolled in multiple parallel cohorts, each defined by study drug, histologic tumor type and molecular tumor profile. Efficacy is analyzed per cohort, enrolling 8 patients in stage I and 16 more in stage II if 1 response is observed in stage I.

Recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck & skin (SCCHN/SCCS) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors can be hypoxic leading to EGFR-TKI resistance. Tarloxotinib bromide (TRLX) is a hypoxia-activated prodrug that releases an irreversible pan-ErbB TKI targeting WT EGFR, mutant EGFR and HER2. Hypoxic tumor targeting with TRLX may lead to greater TKI tumor exposure with less toxicity than current EGFR TKIs. 18F-flortanidazole (18F-HX4) is a new hypoxia PET imaging agent that has the potential to identify and quantify tumor hypoxia with better tumor hypoxia targeting than earlier PET hypoxia agents. However, cross-institutional comparison of PET results without a standardization program can be challenging leading to insufficient or inappropriate conclusions based on PET results.

PET scanners are prequalified using a phantom harmonization program to ensure consistent image quality and robust 18F-HX4 quantitation for cross-institutional comparison. 18F-HX4 uptake will be quantitated to help correlate tumor 18F-HX4 uptake with measurement-based tumor treatment responses. Results', ' Up to 4 sites have been qualified with anthropomorphic phantoms to standardize PET scans and avoid poor quantitation of 18F-HX4.

        "Background":"['Robust prediction of in vivo chemotherapeutic response, using baseline gene expression and drug sensitivity data gathered on cancer cell lines, has been a profoundly important, long standing and controversial problem in pharmacogenomics. Here, we present for the first time, a solution to this problem.Currently, personalizing cancer chemotherapy relies on pathology and more recently molecular biomarker-based approaches (e.g. ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer). However, as the driving biology are normally not fully understood, the majority of existing biomarkers do not capture a substantial proportion of variability in drug response. This partly explains the commonly observed lack of reproducibility of findings (e.g. from many conventional gene expression signatures) when these markers are applied to new datasets.In this study, we developed an approach to predict in vivo drug sensitivity that leverages whole-genome gene expression microarray data and allows the expression of every gene to influence the prediction by a small amount. The method works by fitting a ridge regression model of baseline genome-wide gene expression levels against in vitro drug sensitivity in a very large panel of approximately 700 cancer cell lines. Then, after a (crucial) data homogenization step, these models are applied to baseline expression levels from primary tumor biopsies. Our method successfully predicted patient response to different chemotherapeutic agents in three (of four total suitable) independent, publicly available clinical trials, each investigating different drugs and different types of cancer. In each of these cases, we predicted drug response at least as accurately as previously published models that had been derived from the clinical data itself. Interestingly, our approach could also predict clinical response in the absence of any known drug sensitivity biomarker. We effectively enriched for drug responders in breast, myeloma and lung cancers, treated with docetaxel, bortezomib and erlotinib respectively, thus identifying responders to both cytotoxic and targeted agents.Many previous clinical trials and in vitro assays have attempted to discover biomarkers of drug sensitivity, but found that the genes/aberrations which they had identified, performed poorly as predictors, once applied to out-of-batch sets of samples. Our models, on the other hand, are trained on an independent set of cancer cell lines and performed well on three completely separate and independent clinical trial datasets (all assessed using different microarray platforms). These results have far-reaching implications for personalized medicine and drug development (e.g. for the development of companion diagnostics).

We now report on the entire cohort of 412 fresh-frozen, chemotherapy-nave tumors. Included in the analysis were paired blood and/or tumor-adjacent tissue samples. This is the largest sequencing project on bladder cancer to date. After strict clinical and pathologic quality control, tumors were analyzed for DNA copy number variants, somatic mutations, DNA methylation, mRNA, microRNA and (phospho-) protein expression, transcript splicing, gene fusions, viral integration, APOBEC mutagenesis, pathway perturbation, clinical correlates, and histopathology.Results', ' There was a high overall somatic mutation rate (8.0/Mb), with a median of 245 and mean of 348 coding-region mutations per sample. That is the third highest mutation rate among the cancer types profiled by TCGA (after cutaneous melanoma and non-small cell lung cancers). We identified 54 genes as significantly mutated, compared with 32 in the original report on 131 tumors. TP53 mutations were the most common (49%), and also quite common were mutations in a number of chromatin-modifying genes, including MLL2 (29%), KDM6A (26%), ARID1A (25%), MLL3 (19%), EP300 (15%), CREBBP (12%), and MLL (11%). Other cancer-related genes showing frequent mutations included PIK3CA (22%), RB1 (17%), FGFR3 (14%), STAG2 (14%), ATM (14%), ELF3 (12%), FAT1 (12%), SPTAN1 (12%), ERBB2 (12%), ERBB3 (11%), ASXL2 (10%), ERCC2 (9%), CDKN1A (9%), TSC1 (8%), CDKN2A (7%), RHOB (6%), NFE2L2 (6%), PARD3 (6%), FAM47C (5%), RBM10 (5%),HRAS (5%), KRAS (4%), and PTEN (3%). High mutation burden was associated with improved outcome (p = 0.0004). APOBEC mutagenesis explained 70% of the mutation burden and was associated with survival. Gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation was identified in 167 genes with at least 5% frequency in the cohort. The previously identified four mRNA expression subtypes were again found in the complete set of 412 tumors, and the proportions of samples in each subtype were similar to the previous proportions. Reverse-phase proteomic array analysis of 344 of the samples revealed clusters associated with diagnostic subtype, pathological stage, and grade but not with smoking history or non-muscle invasive status.Conclusions', ' This integrated molecular analysis of 412 TCGA tumor samples largely validates and considerably extends observations from the initial cohort of 131 patients. The larger cohort significantly increased our power to detect lower-frequency aberrations that were not identified in the original cohort.

NCCN guideline lists multiple drugs which are particularly effective in the subgroup of patients with specific gene mutation variants, including the fusion transcripts of ALK, ROS1 and RET, and the mutations of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Multiple techniques have been developed to detect fusion transcripts in tumor samples, such as FISH, IHC and PCR assays. FISH is the most accurate method for fusion detection currently. The split probe FISH assay, which does not require the pre-knowledge of what is the fusion partner with ALK for example, can detect unknown ALK fusion products as well. However, it fails to identify which gene is fused with ALK (or other oncogene) in the chimera products, therefore is not informative for the mechanism or drug resistance study. In addition, due to the limitation on the fluoresce dye, it is quite difficult to multiplex fusion FISH probes for different genes into one assay.We describe here a next generation sequencing assay to detect a panel of fusion transcripts and mutations in one single assay. Our single assay can detect the fusion products of ALK, ROS1 and RET with any known or unknown fusion partners, together with the hotspot mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Our assay can identify not only the exact sequence of the unknown fusion partners, but also any mutations within the full coding regions of ALK, ROS1 and RET. This information is critical for the resistance mechanism study and the next generation inhibitor drug development, since about half of the ALK inhibitor resistance was caused by the mutations in ALK gene itself. We have identified a novel ALK fusion gene with a never-reported fusion partner in a lung cancer patient. The xenograft model derived from this patient responds to crizotinib well in the in vivo study (published on Journal of Thoracic Oncology).

Additionally, cfDNA and FFPE samples are typically limited in the amount of material that can be obtained, and often the FFPE samples are highly degraded, compounding the ability to sequence them and to perform accurate variant calling. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a single tube, multiplexed amplicon sequencing technology that employ hundreds of primer pairs for amplification of targeted loci, producing ready-to-run libraries for Illumina sequencing platforms. The resulting amplicons are less than 150 bp in length, enabling amplification and sensitive detection of mutations from cfDNA-sized DNA fragments or highly damaged DNA. A 200+ amplicon panel across 55 genes was developed to target known clinically relevant oncological mutations. The panel design encompasses single exons (e.g. BRAF) as well as comprehensive exon coverage of entire genes (e.g. TP53).DNA was extracted from FFPE, and cfDNA was extracted from fresh plasma. DNA was quantified by qPCR using 2 primer pairs targeting ALU repeat regions. 10ng of DNA input was used to perform the multiplexed PCR. Libraries were quantified by qPCR and sequenced with MiSEQ V2 reagents, paired end reads. Alignment was performed using Burrows-wheeler Aligner (BWA) and variant calling was performed with at least two validated publicly available tools and confirmed manually by IGV. A variety of tools were used to validate allele technology was used to validate the sequencing data.We interrogated 80 FFPE samples using our amplicon technology.The percent of on-target bases was over 95% and the coverage uniformity was over 98%, where uniformity is the percent based covered over 20% of the mean coverage. Out of the 40 colorectal cancer samples tested, 17 showed mutations in KRAS. Out of the 20 melanoma samples (Cure line) also analyzed, 9 were positive for BRAF V600E. The presence of those mutations was confirmed using myTprimerTM KRAS and BRAF qPCR assay. The limit of detection of the assay was set at 3% due to the inherent noise caused by the damage from the FFPE samples. For cell lines with known mutations, the sensitivity was 0.5%. No false positive or false negative were reported. 20 FFPE samples from different cancer types were also assessed. Mutations were identified in ERBB2 (cervical cancer), ALK (lung cancer) and TP53 (colon cancer) genes, as well as MET amplification (lung cancer).Cell free DNA provides a non-invasive tool to monitor cancer progression and treatment efficacy.

        "Background":"['The 5-year survival rate for early to advanced NSCLC patients is 10-5%. Once the tumor metastasizes, the survival rate often drops below 1%. One of the major challenges is to select the patient for appropriate therapy, and the selection process involves invasive biopsy that is difficult to recurrently perform during treatment. Recent studies have shown that liquid biopsy is an attractive alternative. Liquid biopsy involves analysis of either CTCs or ctDNA to understand the tumor therapy. Isolating entire tumor cells provide an opportunity to perform whole genome sequencing for in depth understanding of the tumor. However, frequent changes in cancer signaling and acquired mutations during treatment lead to drug resistance that cannot be diagnosed using current CTC techniques. These oncogenic biochemical modifications that are often associated with metastasis involve upregulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway that change the elasticity of tumor cells for easy shedding into the blood stream. Consequently, EMT transition leads to depletion in epithelial markers such as EpCAM and cytokeratin that are to be targeted. This effect largely limits the use of present technologies utilizing EpCAM as a marker to isolate the CTCs. We hypothesized that these cells can be captured by targeting surface markers that are overexpressed in EM transitioned CTCs. For example, markers such as EGFR and HER2 have been shown to be overexpressed pre and post EMT tumors and therefore can present as a new strategy for non-invasive diagnosis before and during treatment. In this study we have shown that EGFR and HER2 receptors are overexpressed in EGFR and KRAS mutated NSCLC cells. We artificially activated EMT in NSCLC cells and compared the surface biomarker concentrations. Furthermore, we used protein analysis data using western blotting to identify our targets after EMT. Based on the biomarker concentrations, we designed and developed magnetic nanocubes (MNC) surface attached with antibodies to target the selected biomarkers to capture EMT CTCs. The capture efficiency of these magnetic nanocubes was compared in multiple cell lines (HCC827 and A549). Overall we could achieve capture as low as 10 spiked cells in our study. In conclusion, cancer markers such as EGFR and HER-2 that are highly expressed in tumors, once shed as CTCs can be targeted for diagnosis. Therefore, we have developed a novel method to capture EMT CTCs with high selectivity and this method presents a minimally-invasive method for real-time monitoring of patients during drug treatment.']",

The first three mechanisms lead to inhibition of HER3 phosphorylation and downstream signaling thereby resulting in tumor cell growth inhibition, while ADCC is a mechanism of direct target cell killing triggered by cross-linking of Fc receptors on immune effector cells (e.g. NK cells, macrophages).RG7116 is a novel humanized and glycoengineered IgG1 antibody currently in clinical development, that binds to HER3 with high affinity. This antibody prevents ligand binding and receptor heterodimerization, thereby blocking receptor phosphorylation. In various tumor xenograft models monotherapy treatment with this antibody leads to substantial tumor growth inhibition. Only in a few cases monotherapy treatment resulted in complete tumor remission. Most of the models initially show convincing efficacy, but tumors regrow after a while. Combination therapy with other HER targeted therapies such as pertuzumab, cetuximab or erlotinib, lead to complete remission in preclinical models. The combination of RG7116 with downstream signaling inhibitors like', ' everolimus (mTOR) andand other anti-cancer agents leads to increased efficacy.']",

It has been identified as an oncogenic driver in various malignancies and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population. Future studies should incorporate MET CISH in clinical trials utilizing MET-targeted agents to determine its potential as a predictive test for evaluating who may derive the most benefit.']",

For common mutations in EGFR, treatment with 1st generation TKIs results in approximately 70% overall response rate, increased progression free survival, and increased quality of life compared to chemotherapy alone. However, resistance to 1st generation TKIs typically develops within ~12 months, and approximately 55% of patients acquire a secondary mutation in EGFR Exon 20, T790M. To overcome resistance, 2nd and 3rd generation covalently binding TKIs targeting T790M mutations have been developed. Recent studies show that approximately 40% of acquired resistance to 2nd and 3rd generation TKIs can also occur via a third acquired EGFR mutation at the site of covalent binding, C797S. To date, there are no standard approved targeted therapies for treating EGFR C797S mutant NSCLC. Moreover, with proposed increased use of covalent inhibitors in the first line setting, C797S mutations are expected to become more prevalent and new strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance will be required. To this end, we have generated stable Ba/F3 and HCC827 NSCLC cell lines expressing C797S mutant EGF receptors with common mutations in EGFR including, L858R/T790M/C797S, and Ex19del/T790M/C797S. EGFR mutant cell lines expressing C797S were screened against 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation EGFR TKIs and cell viability was determined using Cell Titer Glo.

However Ba/F3 and HCC827 cell lines transfected with EGFR triple mutants were inhibited by non-covalent inhibitors', ' CUDC-101, an EGFR, HER2 and HDAC inhibitor, and PKC412, a FLT3 inhibitor. In triple mutant Ba/F3 cells, CUDC-101 and PKC412 had IC50 values of 470nM and 250nM in Ex19del/T790M/C797S EGFR mutants, respectively, and IC50 values of 690nM and 270nM in L858R/T790M/C797S EGFR mutants.

In addition, western blot analysis of triple mutant Ba/F3 cells showed decreased phosphorylation of EGFR in presence of 50nM PKC412 and 500nM of CUDC-101. Moreover, PKC412 partially decreased p-EGFR expression at 50nM in HCC827 triple mutant cell lines. In conclusion, unlike other EGFR TKIs, the non-covalent EGFR inhibitors CUDC-101 and PKC412 inhibit both T790M and C797S EGFR mutants at low concentrations.

        "Background":"['Combination therapy of c-Met/EGFR TKIs against c-Met/EGFR, while initially effective, has been shown to be susceptible to acquired resistance. To establish a mechanism of TKI resistance, the NSCLC model cell lines H2170 and H358 were made resistant to the c-Met/EGFR TKIs SU11274, erlotinib, or a combination by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of inhibitors. Phospho-Met (Tyr1003) was found to be downregulated 4- and 1.5- fold in H2170 and H358 cells, respectively. Phospho-EGFR was found to be upregulated in H2170 cells and downregulated in H358 cells. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in c-Met/EGFR downstream signaling proteins, indicating that alternative signaling pathways such as the canonical Wnt pathway may confer TKI resistance. To determine differences in Wnt signaling between parental and resistant cell lines, immunoblotting was performed. In the H2170 erlotinib resistant (H2170-ER) cell line, a 5- and 6-fold increase in phospho-LRP5/6 as well as a 2- and 3-fold increase in total-LRP5/6 was observed in the presence or absence of erlotinib, respectively. Furthermore, H2170-ER cells exhibited a 3- and 16-fold increase in NKD2 as well as a 2.5- and 6-fold increase in Wnt3A in the presence or absence of EGF, respectively. A 2- to 2.5-fold increase was also observed in DVL2/3 in the absence of EGF. However, the Wnt pathway did not seem to have a significant role in H358 cells. Since EGFR and Wnt signaling are known to exhibit crosstalk, activation of the Wnt pathway may stimulate activation of EGFR causing resistance. This is suggested as upregulation of proteins involved in the Wnt pathway was seen only in the H2170 cell line. These results were confirmed by treating H2170 cells with the Wnt inhibitor XAV939. MTT analysis indicated that parental cells showed no significant response to XAV939, however, resistant cell lines showed a 2-fold decrease in viability when compared to a c-Met/EGFR TKI combination treatment. We propose a new treatment modality with Wnt inhibitors which have not yet entered clinical testing.To identify new targets for NSCLC, stable isotope labeling by heavy/light amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled with mass spectroscopy was used. Analysis revealed more than 200 proteins modulated greater than 1.5-fold, six of which have significant potential to influence cell growth and survival based on their biological roles in NSCLC. These proteins include total--catenin, TPR, syntenin, HMGB2, TOM34 and AIF. We are currently using tandem mass tagging (TMT) to further investigate additional modulated proteins. Proteins of interest identified by this method include TPD52, erbB2, MESDC2, PIN1, PEA15 and NRAS. Proteins confirmed to be upregulated/activated in resistant cell lines will be further investigated as targets which induce drug resistance in NSCLC.Citation Format', ' Ryan Jacobs, Jason Fong, David Moravec, Greg Botting, Ryan Bomgarden, John Rogers, Rosa Viner, Michael Blank, Neelu Puri.

Most NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations will respond to EGFR-TKIs; however, in about 50% of these cases a secondary mutation in EGFR (T790M) subsequently occurs which results in resistance to treatment. Other mechanisms of clinical resistance can also occur such as amplification of MET kinase and EMT conversion; however, additional routes of resistance are poorly defined. Using a novel patient-derived NSCLC xenograft model, driven by the L858R EGFR mutation, we set out to recapitulate the reported clinical routes of resistance to EGFR inhibitors and to evaluate if additional mechanism could also be identified.METHODS', ' LION102 is a NSCLC adenocarcinoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model with an activating EGFR mutation (L858R) which is maintained subcutaneously in vivo admixed with a human stromal cell component. Resistant models were generated in vivo through repeated cycling of treatment for up to 10 weeks with EGFR-TKI alone or in combination with a MET inhibitor. Resistant tumour material was characterised for further mutations in the EGFR gene by direct sequencing as well as for MET, AXL and HER2 over-expression and genomic amplification by quantitative PCR; Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC).RESULTS', ' Nave LION102 PDX tumours exhibited exquisite sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs (100% reduction in pre-treatment tumour volume, p<0.0001). Following successive cycles of EGFR-TKI treatment in vivo several resistant subtypes were generated and characterized.CONCLUSIONS', ' EGFR-TKI resistant subtypes were generated in vivo from a proprietary patient-derived xenograft model (LION102) bearing an activating EGFR mutation (L858R) and characterised for their resistance mechanism. PDX models of resistance will be invaluable in assessing novel agents targeting the EGFR pathway and the development of new combination strategies which seek to prevent or overcome resistance to EGFR-TKIs.']",

However, in most cases, tumors recur and become resistant to the treatment after a period of time. There are urgent needs to understand the underlying drug resistance mechanisms, to discover drug resistance targets and drug resistance biomarkers and to develop new therapies or combination therapies to tackle this widely occurring clinical problem. Currently the main approaches to study cancer drug resistance include analyzing clinical samples and developing drug resistance models in vitro. Numerous potential resistance mechanisms have been revealed. However, validation of these findings in a clinical-like setting and to test therapies in preclinical studies requires in vivo tumor models of drug resistance.At GenenDesign, we have developed cancer drug resistance PDX tumor models through short term drug testing or long term treatment of xenograft tumor mice. Cancer drugs investigated in our studies include major classes of targeted therapeutic modalities such as Her2 inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, FGFR inhibitors and cMet/ALK inhibitors, as well as several standard of care (SoC) chemotherapies. From these studies, we have identified de novo resistance models, acquired resistance models and reversible resistance models in multiple cancer types including lung cancer and gastric cancer.In analyzing more than a dozen of Her2 positive but Herceptin resistance PDX models, we have uncovered molecular abnormalities such as Pten deletion, PI3K mutation, amplification of EGFR, cMet and cyclin E, which have been reported previously to be associated with Herceptin resistance in early studies. Studies are on-going to test whether combination therapies will be effective in overcoming Herceptin resistance.In drug response profiling of our PDX models, we also found wide spread phenotypical and functional heterogeneity in individual tumors. The heterogeneity within each tumor, in some cases, contributed to evolving of drug resistance from initially responsive tumors.']",

However their initial efficacy is limited by the development of drug resistance mutations, including the gatekeeper T790M mutation. Second-generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors that were designed to overcome the drug resistance by T790M mutation have thus far had limited success. Our goal was then to develop a dual kinase EGFR inhibitor effective against gefitinib sensitive and resistant (T790M) mutations. Herein, we describe the biological and pharmacokinetic properties of a representative molecule, KL-ON113 from a series of novel and small molecule EGFR inhibitors as a clinical development for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Experimental Procedures', ' Based on structure activity relationship (SAR) studies, we identified a novel dual kinase EGFR inhibitor, KL-ON113 effective against gefitinib sensitive and resistant (T790M) mutations. EGFR tyrosine kinase activity of KL-ON113 was determined using HTRF KinEASE assay kit (CisBio, Bedford, MA) with modifications. EGF induced cell proliferation assay (XTT) was conducted to determine the growth inhibitory effect of KL-ON113 in EGFR expressing WT and mutant cell lines. Inhibition of EGF induced EGFR phosphorylation (Y1173) in A431 cells was measured by PathScan Phospho-EGF Receptor (Tyr1173) Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Metabolic stability of the KL-ON113 was evaluated in microsomes obtained from mouse, rat, monkey, and human. Pharmacokinetic behavior of KL-ON113 in plasma after single dose oral administration or IV injection was determined in female Balb/c mice.Results', ' KL-ON113 demonstrated remarkable potency against the purified EGFR/HER2 including EGFR (wt), EGFR (L858R), EGFR (delE746_A750), EGFR (T790M), EGFR (L858R/T790M) and HER2 with IC50 of 12nM, 1.3nM, 0.9nM, 49nM, 325nM and 14nM, respectively with 100-fold more active against gefitinib/erlotinib resistant L858R/T790M EGFR mutant.

        "Background":"['HER3 is a member of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER) family. HER3 is a kinase dead receptor, but by forming heterodimers with other HER family receptors, HER3 works as amplifier for PI3 kinase driven tumorigenesis. It has been reported that tumors treated with EGFR-, HER2- or cMET-targeted therapies can escape via HER3 activation or upregulation. HER3 is expressed in a large variety of tumors for example in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. Anti-HER3 antibodies can work via various mechanisms including', \" (1) blocking ligand (HRGs) binding to the receptor, (2) blocking heterodimerization with other HER family members (HER1, 2 and 4), (3) downregulation of the receptor from the cell surface, and (4) engaging immune effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The first three mechanisms lead to inhibition of HER3 phosphorylation and downstream signaling thereby resulting in tumor cell growth inhibition, while ADCC is a mechanism of direct target cell killing triggered by cross-linking of Fc receptors on immune effector cells (e.g. NK cells, macrophages). GE-huMab-HER3 is a novel humanized and glycoengineered IgG1 antibody that binds to HER3 with high affinity. This antibody prevents ligand binding and receptor heterodimerization thereby blocking receptor phosphorylation. In various tumor xenograft models treatment with this antibody leads to substantial tumor growth inhibition. E.g. GE-huMab-HER3 treatment achieved >50% tumor growth inhibition in 10 out of 17 NSCLC models and in some cases even resulted in complete tumor remission. However, these xenograft experiments only reveal part of this antibody's therapeutic potential. A unique feature of GE-huMab-HER3 that differentiates it from other anti-HER3 antibodies, including AMG 888 and MM-121, is its ability to bind to human FcgRIIIa on immune effector cells with a 50-fold higher affinity than standard IgG1 antibodies, a property conferred by the engineered glycosylation of the antibody Fc region. Consequently, GE-huMab-HER3 exhibits superior potency and efficacy in ADCC, as shown in vitro using recombinant A549 cells and in vivo by its Fc mediated greater anti-tumor effect in A549 orthotopic mouse models compared to a non-glyco-engineered variant of the antibody, WT-huMab-HER3. The combination of strong signaling inhibition and enhanced ADCC capability renders GE-huMabHER3 a highly potent HER3-targeting agent. Phase I clinical testing of this promising novel compound is ongoing.\"]",

Methods', ' IHC of EGFR and HER2 using paraffin-embedded samples of tumor tissue from 51 patients with CRPC was analyzed according to the percentage of positively stained tumor cells and the intensity of staining. Genomic DNA was extracted from 18 tissue samples containing 60% tumor tissue. Nested PCR using specific primers for exons 18, 19 and 21 of EGFR and exons 18-24 of the HER2 followed by direct DNA sequencing was performed. Internet based BLAST-search was used to identify mutations of the amplified exons and neighbouring introns. Results', ' According to the different cut-off values of 10%, 30%, 50% or 70% for the percentage of positively stained cells, expression rates ranged from 30.6%-61.2% for EGFR and 9.6%-28.8% for HER2. Defining positive expression as 30% positively stained tumor cells, with an intensity of staining of 2+, resulted in positive expression of EGFR in 38.8% and HER2 in 13.5% of the patients. None of the 180 examined exons and neighbouring introns of EGFR and HER2 contained activating mutations that are known to influence response to targeted therapies. Conclusions', ' Our results demonstrate different rates of expression according to the definition of positive expression for EGFR and HER2 which may have a major impact on the results of clinical targeted trials. In our series no activating mutations of EGFR and HER2 were found. Since activating mutations for EGFR have only been found in about 10% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the number of analyzed samples seems to be too small to detect a relevant number of mutations in CRPC.

Aberrant activation of HER3 as a result of HER2 amplification or neuregulin 1 (NRG1) over-expression has been demonstrated to mediate constitutive activation of downstream oncogenic signals. LJM716 is a fully human IgG1 anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody. It locks HER3 in an inactive conformation and prevents HER3 dimerization with other ErbB family members. This unique mode of action enables LJM716 to block both ligand dependent and ligand independent HER3 activation. In search of new indications that may benefit from anti-HER3 therapies, we noted that squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) tend to have relatively higher NRG1 expression as compared to their adenocarcinoma counterparts. Highest NRG1 expression was observed in the lung SCC cell lines in cell line encyclopedia (CLE). A subset of the lung SCC cell lines with high NRG1 expression are moderately sensitive to LJM716, with HER3 activation detected in all of the sensitive lines. Additionally, EGFR activation is consistently observed in our panel of squamous lung carcinoma models. In some cases, activation of HER2 and/or HER3 is also noted. We hypothesize that squamous lung carcinomas may be dependent on signaling through EGFR, HER2 and HER3. To completely block EGFR, HER2-HER3 signaling, we set to test the treatment of LJM716 and Cetixumab in a number of NGR 1 positive squamous lung carcinomas tumor models. Enhanced anti tumor activity of LJM716 and Cetixumab is observed in four out nine tumor models. Analysis of broad activation status of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) reveals that a subset of responsive models have activated pEGFR, pHER2 and pHER3. These data suggest that activated HER3 signaling may be important in a subset of lung squamous cell carcinoma.

Many patients initially benefit from erlotinib treatment, but nearly all acquires resistance and die of the disease. Several mechanisms related to erlotinib-resistance have been described including epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Signalling by TGF, Wnt or through receptor tyrosine kinases can initiate EMT, but not much is known about the trigger in relation to erlotinib-resistance. In this study, we investigate how EMT is initiated in two erlotinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines developing erlotinib-resistance.Methods', ' HCC827 (EGFR mutated) and Calu-3 (HER2 amplified) were treated with erlotinib in escalating concentrations (0.01 M - 5 M) over approximately 3 months, and erlotinib resistant (ER) sublines were established and investigated.Results', ' Both HCC827ER and Calu-3ER gained EMT features including upregulation of SLUG, SNAIL and ZEB1. These changes were accompanied by increased IGF1R signalling in Calu-3ER and HCC827ER gained a MET amplification. To detect the relevance of MET and IGF1R signalling in accordance to EMT, we treated the cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors crizotinib (MET) and linsitinib (IGF1R). In both cases, we saw a decrease in EMT-marker transcription after the treatment. In addition, HCC827ER showed growth inhibition when treated with the MET-inhibitor crizotinib, but linsitinib did not inhibit the growth of Calu-3ER. Conclusion', ' Our study demonstrates how different receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways can induce EMT during the development of erlotinib-resistance.

While EGFR overexpression and/or amplification has been shown to occur frequently in human breast cancer, EGFR-activating mutations are suggested to be rare if not absent. Thus, the aim of our study was to examine the presence of somatic EGFR gene mutations in a group of norwegian patients diagnosed with early breast cancer. Patients. We investigated tumor biopsies obtained from 132 patients with early breast cancer treated at the Akershus University Hospital (University of Oslo) in 2007/2008. The majority of patients (n = 82) belonged to the luminal- A/B subtypes of BC. In addition, 33 patients were classified as HER-2 positive patients (IHC 3+ or amplification verified by FISH) and 17 as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Methods. Briefly, DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue using QIAsymphony DSP DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.). The extraction of DNA was performed by fully automated purification using the QIAsymphony SP/AS system. EGFR-mutations were detected using a Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR kit according to the manufacturers protocol. We tested for point mutations in exon 18 (G719A/C/S), in-frame deletions in exon 19 (E746-A750), in-frame insertions as well as point mutations in exon 20 (S768I, T790M) and a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R). Results. In the present study we detected three individuals with an EGFR-T790M mutation. Two of the patients were diagnosed with TNBC, while the disease of the third patient was classified as a luminal-A type breast cancer. Interestingly, the T790M-mutation was present in the biopsies obtained during surgery before adjuvant therapy was initiated. No anti-cancer therapy has been given prior to surgery. According to our best knowledge, the T790M-TKI-resistance-mutation has not been detected in early breast cancer previously. This finding contrasts the observations made in lung cancer patients where the T790M mutation in general is a classical second mutation causing drug resistance during ongoing TKI-therapy. No other EGFR-mutations were detected in our patients. Conclusion', ' To our best knowledge we provide first evidence for the presence of the EGFR-T790M-mutation in human early breast cancer. Thus, treatment with novel EGFR-targeting cancer drugs (like pan-HER-inhibitors) affecting also T790M-mutated-EGFR may be worthwhile to be tested in highly selected breast cancer patients.']",

However, treatment-related toxicities, particularly gastrointestinal adverse events, have limited clinical development of this class of agents. The development of efficacy biomarkers to gamma-secretase inhibitors and antibodies to Notch ligands and receptors could speed clinical testing. Mutations in Notch1, a dominant Notch receptor, are rare in human solid tumors, and clinical activity has not been observed in patients with tumors bearing Notch1 activating mutations, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia from available clinical data. Identification of tumors with abundant target expression and/or active Notch signaling status characteristic of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) expression by immunohistochemistry may have clinical utility. All levels of tumor Notch1 expression comprised of low, moderate and high detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitated by digital imaging technology were observed in 52% (34/66) of lung cancers, 51% (35/68) of ovarian cancers, and 11% (7/63) of breast cancers (lung or ovary vs. breast, P<0.0001 by 2-sided Fisher Exact Test). Notch1 was expressed at high levels in 20% of lung cancers including sarcoma, neuroendocrine, small cell and undifferentiated carcinomas, as well as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomas. High expression of Notch1 was observed in 9% of ovarian tumors including undifferentiated carcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, and endometrioid adenocarcinoma. In breast cancer, it was noted in one case of infiltrating ductal carcinoma with triple-negative phenotype. Expression of high-level Notch1 varies in lung cancer vs. ovarian cancer vs. breast cancer (P=0.002 by Chi-square statistic), and was frequently associated with NICD expression. Notch1 was not significantly associated with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or HER2 status in breast cancer. These data suggest that the frequency of all levels of Notch1 expression is significantly higher in lung cancer and ovarian cancer than breast cancer; and high-level Notch1 is more frequent in lung cancer than in ovarian cancer, and, likewise, more frequent in ovarian cancer than in breast cancer.

Hypothesizing this discrepancy may be related to the overall impact the drugs had on standard of care within their respective indications, we evaluated the relationship between mutation screening frequency and hazard ratios (HRs) from pivotal clinical trials (Shaw Lancet Oncol 2011; Gerber Cancer Cell 2010; Slamon NEJM2001). As a historical control, we also assessed HER2 screening trends.  Methods', '  BRAF, ALK, and HER2 screening data were collected via Ipsos Tandem Oncology Monitor, a commercial system in which oncologists in US (500) and EU (783) enter de-identified data on actual prescriptions and mutation screening orders by indication for cancer patients from their practice.

This implies a relationship between outcomes and the propensity for mutation testing. Conclusions', '  While it is likely that the potential for benefit drives mutation testing, clinicians may also be less likely to screen for an uncommon mutation (~5% of NSCLC patients), or may choose to test only those patients with known predisposing factors. Additionally, oncologists may go through a testing algorithm for NSCLC patients where mutations that are more common are screened first (i.e., EGFR  KRAS  ALK).  BRAF testing reached nearly 90% in one year compared to nearly 10 years for HER2 and emphasizes the impact vemurafenib has had on standard of care.

Therapy targeting HER2 is now routinely used in treatment of HER2-amplificed breast cancer and has changed the natural history of this disease. The region of chromosome 17q12 containing Her2 contains many genes, and little is known about the actual genomic alterations that underlie the amplification event. While it is known that parts of the amplicon exist in multiple copies in a tumor, the exact structure of the duplicated region is not known and their relative orientation and positions in the genome is not clear. There is the potential for rearrangements between the genes and for different segments of the amplicon to exist and varied copy numbers. There is no clear way to assemble the complete structure of this region using short reads, as they cannot resolve repetitive regions and identify junction reads. Long read sequencing has the potential to overcome these limitations, however the sequencing depth is limited and difficult to apply to large genomes. To apply long read sequencing to a limited part of the cancer genome, we have used Nimblegen target enrichment coupled with Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Bioscience sequencing in an attempt to sequence and assemble the Her2 amplicon. The error rate of the sequencers are not of concern since we are not looking at base-pair level variation. Instead, our need is for long reads that can span the gene boundaries and repetitive elements to give complete structure of the amplicon. Nimblegen custom capture probes were designed for the 2mb chromosomal region containing Her2. DNA was extracted from 3 breast cancer cell lines and enriched using the Nimblegen kit. This DNA was then sequenced with long reads on the MinIon and the PacBio to allow for complete assembly of the region.

Serum concentrations of EGFR have been evaluated as screening, diagnostic, prognostic, and theragnostic markers for diverse human malignancies, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, and lung cancer.

Here we demonstrate that an alternately spliced EGFR isoform, termed sEGFR, gives rise to the circulating sEGFR protein through proteolytic cleavage of a cell surface precursor. This cleavage event is inhibited by fibronectin and stimulated by both an anti-5/1 integrin antibody and the metalloprotease activator 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Preliminary results identify ADAM17/TACE as at least one mediator of sEGFR shedding. Shed sEGFR binds to EGF with high affinity. Two FDA-approved therapeutic anti-EGFR antibodies, cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix), inhibit shedding of sEGFR, implicating sEGFR as a potential alternative target for these antibodies, consistent with previous studies indicating that baseline serum sEGFR concentrations may predict responsiveness to anti-EGFR-targeted therapy.

Results', '  Thirty five (n=35) never-smokers with advanced pan-negative lung adenocarcinomas were identified. A RET or ROS1 fusion was found in 31% [n=10/32, 95% CI, 15-47%] of patients.

In the intracranial implantation mice model implanted the HER2-positive cell line (MDA-MB-361-luc-2), S-222611 showed more potent anti-tumor activity than lapatinib. On the basis of higher penetration in brain of S-222611 than lapatinib indicated by the preclinical pharmacokinetic studies, we demonstrated the application of S-222611 to brain metastases with breast cancer. In order to enhance the clinical predictability of S-222611 to the treatment of brain metastases, we have developed the experimental brain metastases models in mice of HER2-positive breast cancer (MDA-MB-361-luc-2-BR2/BR3) or T790M-EGFR expressing lung cancer (NCI-H1975-luc). After a single oral administration of S-222611 or lapatinib, the concentrations of S-222611 and lapatinib in the brain metastatic regions of these mice models were analyzed by quantitative imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). In the NCI-H1975 lung cancer model (intraventricular injection model), the concentrations of S-222611 in brain metastases quantified by IMS were comparable to those of lapatinib. In contrast, in the MDA-MB-361 breast cancer model (intraventricular injection model), the concentrations of S-222611 in brain metastases were over 10 times higher than those of lapatinib, and the tumor-to-normal brain ratio of S-222611 was approximately 4 times higher than that of lapatinib. IMS revealed that the concentrations in brain metastases and tumor-to-normal brain ratio of S-222611 were significantly higher than those of lapatinib in the breast cancer mice model.

In the lung cancer model, fluorescently labeled dextran was highly detected in the brain metastatic regions than brain parenchyma. However, in the breast cancer models, fluorescence intensities for dextran in the brain metastatic regions and brain parenchyma were comparable, indicating that the BTB was remained to be largely intact in brain metastases of the breast cancer model but disrupted in the lung cancer model.

Translocation of ERBB family members EGFR, HER2 and HER4 into nucleus for regulating gene transcription have been reported, but only a few studies about nuclear HER3 have been reported and the biological role of nuclear HER3 is still unknown. HER3 was detected in the nucleus of 57% in Japanese lung cancers, and has also been detected in the nuclei of prostate cancers and other cancer cell lines. A study suggested that nuclear HER3 by IHC is associated with favorable overall survival in 128 uveal melanoma patients. The potential mechanism of HER3 translocation and its role on drug resistance was intensively studied in the work. According to our observation, nuclear HER3 was found to be significantly increased in HER2-positive breast cancer cells SKBr3 during an EGFR-targeted therapy Iressa, and increased sub-band of HER3 was detected by Western blot in the Iressa-resistant SKBr3 cells. The Iressa-induced HER3 nuclear localization in SKBr3 and BT474 cells can be inhibited by the application of ADAM17 and gamma-secretase inhibitors or siRNA, the additional inhibitors can sensitize the cells to Iressa treatment which may be a new target for preventing HER3-mediated drug resistance.

        "Background":"['Targeted therapies have changed the treatment paradigm of cancer. Specifically, the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved therapeutic responses in a number of tumor types. However, initial response to TKIs is often followed by rapid relapse due to the acquisition of molecular features that lead to resistance. ERBB3, a receptor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1) family, has been linked to the development of resistance to multiple ERBB targeting TKIs. A proposed potential mechanism is the recruitment and activation of ERBB3 as a bypass mechanism to activate PI3K dependent pro-survival pathways. We investigated whether the inhibition of ERBB3 could reverse TKI resistance linked to ERBB3 activation. AV-203 is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed against ERBB3. AV-203 potently inhibits both ligand dependent and ligand independent activation of ERBB3. AV-203 was shown to inhibit the binding of NRG1 to ERBB3 and promote ERBB3 degradation. The tumor growth inhibitory activity of AV-203 was demonstrated in numerous xenograft models representing major human carcinomas (breast, lung, ovarian, kidney and pancreas). Here, we investigated the ability of AV-203 to restore TKI sensitivity in models with activated ERBB3. First, we demonstrated that ligand mediated (NRG1) activation of ERBB3 leads to acquired resistance to the EGFR TKI erlotinib in a lung cancer model bearing EGFR TKI sensitizing mutation, to the ERBB2/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib in a HER2 amplified breast cancer model, and to the EGFR inhibitory antibody cetuximab in head and neck cancer models. AV-203 was able to restore sensitivity to these RTK inhibitors. This data suggest that the combination of AV-203, with EGFR/HER2 targeted therapies could potentially extend the efficacy of these agents by preventing the emergence of ERBB3 mediated resistance. This hypothesis will be tested in future clinical trials. AV-203 is currently in Phase I development for the treatment of solid tumors.']",

        "Background":"['Many available oncology therapies are targeted to specific proteins, the most notable examples being therapies targeted to EGFR and Her2. For targeted therapies to have maximal efficacy, it is necessary to identify patients whose tumors express the target protein. As more pathways and proteins are identified as tumor drivers and therapies are developed that target those proteins, and more patient screening tools are needed to efficiently direct patients to correct therapeutic regimens.While chemotherapy regimens are not often considered targeted therapies, protein biomarkers for chemotherapy efficacy have been identified; for example amplification of TOPO2A is known to improve response to anthracycline-based therapy combinations. Though many chemotherapy biomarkers have been identified, screening is not routine, and chemotherapy regimens are not being adjusted for individual tumor biology.To address the growing need for efficient patient screening using minimal tissue, OncoPlex Diagnostics has built a comprehensive protein quantification panel that allows for the simultaneous quantitation of multiple actionable proteins from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded patient biopsies using multiplex mass spectrometry. This panel currently quantifies nine proteins that are markers of targeted therapy (including ALK, AR, EGFR, HER2, HER3, MET, MSLN, and PD-L1) and includes the ChemoPlex panel, which quantifies chemotherapy biomarkers (ERCC1, FRalpha, hENT1, RRM1, SPARC, TOPO1, TOPO2A). Since 2013, over 270 biopsies from multiple indications have been analyzed for protein expression in the OncoPlex Diagnostics CAP-qualified, CLIA-certified laboratory, revealing large ranges of expression for many drug targets that are not routinely assayed.Because of the importance of TOPO2A in anthracycline-based therapies, which are commonly prescribed in breast cancer patients, sixty-two breast cancer biopsies were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 62 samples, 41 were positive for TOPO2A expression; ranging from 233-1750amol/ug. Of the primary biopsies, 80% of them expressed TOPO2A; however only two of seven liver metastases were positive for TOPO2A. These data suggest that anthracycline-based therapy might not be as efficacious in metastatic sites due to the lack of TOPO2A.Also of interest, quantification of FRalpha, a biomarker for folate-targeted therapies, showed a 50-fold range of expression in NSCLC cases, and TOPO1, the target of irinotecan and topotecan, showed a 10-fold range of expression in various indications, with 4% of biopsies having no detectable TOPO1.These wide expression ranges of known biomarkers suggest that certain therapies might have vastly different response rates based on biomarker expression. To derive the best therapeutic response to both targeted and chemotherapy regimens, it is necessary to understand each patient tumor biology individually.']",

Studies have shown that RT induces MMP-9 production in tumor cells by activating NF-B through PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. However, clinical applications of inhibitors targeting these pathways are lacking due to toxicity and low efficacy. EGFR and HER2 are canonical upstream signaling molecules that activate these pathways. Additionally, EGFR and HER2, when stimulated with ligands, have been found to induce MMP-9 expression. In this study, we aim to determine the roles of EGFR and HER2 in RT-induced MMP-9 expression, tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis using EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib and EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, afatinib.Methods and Materials', ' We used western blot analysis to determine EGFR, HER2, and Akt phosphorylations in irradiated Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells (7.5 Gy) pretreated with erlotinib or afatinib. We then used RT-PCR, western blot assay, ELISA, and gelatin zymography to evaluate MMP-9 expression in irradiated LLC cells pretreated with erlotinib or afatinib. Clonogenic assays estimated irradiated LLC cell survival treated with erlotinib or afatinib. Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber assay was used to evaluate invasion capability of irradiated LLC cells. Lastly, tissue western blot analyses of EGFR/HER2/Akt phosphorylations and MMP-9 were performed in LLC tumor grown on the thigh of C57BL/6 mice treated with combined RT and either drug.Results', ' RT induced EGFR, HER2, and Akt phosphorylations as well as increased MMP-9 expression in LLC cells. Pretreatment with afatinib suppressed RT-induced MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression more significantly than erlotinib. Afatinib inhibited RT-induced invasiveness of LLC cells more than erlotinib did. Tissue western blot analysis of irradiated LLC ectopic xenografts showed more inhibition of RT-induced in vivo MMP-9 expression by afatinib than erlotinib. Afatinib was a stronger inhibitor than erlotinib for RT-induced MMP-9 up-regulation and cell invasiveness in LLC cells and ectopic xenografts. However, clonogenic assay of LLC cells showed that neither erlotinib nor afatanib sensitized LLC cells to RT in survival.Conclusion', ' Our results suggest that sublethal irradiation induces MMP-9 expression through EGFR and HER2 activation. Dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 kinase better suppress RT-induced MMP-9 expression and abolish tumor cell invasiveness. Afatinib may serve as an orally bioavailable agent that ameliorates distant metastasis from inadequately irradiated primary lung tumor.']",

        "Background":"['The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is encoded by the proto-oncogene c-erbB-2 and initiates downstream signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. HER2 is overexpressed in several cancer (Ca) types and is one of the most strongly validated targets for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer serving as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker. Several HER2-targeting antibodies as well as antibody-drug conjugates are either approved or are in clinical development. Prolonged treatment with monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates have resulted in development of resistance and so there is still an unmet medical need for drugs of new mechanism of action targeting this important receptor system. We describe herein the generation of a high energy, alpha-particle emitting HER2 targeted thorium-227 antibody-chelator conjugate. HER2-TTC consists of the humanized HER2 targeting IgG1 antibody (trastuzumab) covalently linked via an amide bond to a 3,2-hydroxypyridino-based chelator moiety, enabling efficient radiolabeling with the alpha particle emitting radionuclide thorium-227 (Th-227). HER2-TTC was prepared at high radiochemical yield and purity. When tested for binding to recombinant HER2, HER2-TTC was shown to retain comparable binding affinity to trastuzumab. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments were performed on 8 cell lines with different HER2 expression levels (from 7 000 - 500 000 mAbs bound/ cell as determined by FACS) of breast, ovarian, gastric and lung cancer origin. HER2-TTC demonstrated target mediated in vitro cytotoxicity in the pM-range. In vivo biodistribution and anti-tumor efficacy of HER2-TTC was evaluated in the dose range 100-500 kBq/kg at a protein dose of 0.14 mg/kg and i.v. injection in the s.c. KPL-4 breast and Calu-3 lung model previously described to be resistant to trastuzumab. The biodistribution study demonstrated specific tumor accumulation of HER2-TTC in both models with a maximum of 77 and 50 %ID/g 227Th at t = 168 h post dose (decay corrected to T0), respectively. Significant antitumor efficacy was shown for HER2-TTC in the JIMT-1 s.c. breast Ca xenograft model resistant to trastuzumab and T-DM1. The promising preclinical anti-tumor activity supports the development of the targeted alpha therapeutic HER2-TTC for the treatment of trastuzumab and T-DM1 resistant patients.']",

        "Background":"['ERBB3 is widely expressed in human carcinomas, and its over expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with various carcinomas, (i.e., breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and head and neck cancers). The presence of ERBB3 correlates with local to distal metastasis in lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers as well as bone invasion in prostate cancer. Activation of ERBB3 is also implicated in the development of resistance to current cancer treatments. Due to its lack of kinase activity, the activation of the ERBB3 receptor is dependent on heterodimerization with active receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The recruitment of ERBB3 into active, heterodimer complexes is mediated by its ligand Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) or by amplified, over expressed RTKs in a ligand independent manner. Therefore, ERBB3 can crosstalk with most major receptors involved in cancer development and maintenance such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and c-MET. AV-203 is a potent, humanized anti-ERBB3 antibody that inhibits both ligand-dependent and independent activation of ERBB3 both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AV-203 were characterized in mice using the A549 non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model. AV-203 administered IV in mice exhibits acceptable pharmacokinetics supporting preclinical efficacy studies. AV-203 administered IV in A549 NSCLC xenograft tumor bearing mice had lower serum AUC than nave mice, demonstrating that the presence of human ErbB3 may alter the PK parameters of AV-203. In evaluating pharmacodynamics in vivo, AV-203 was able to down regulate total ERBB3 and ERBB3 signaling in A549 tumors in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of ERBB3 signaling correlated with significant dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in the A549 xenograft model. Dose scheduling studies with the constant AV-203 dose of 2.5 mg/kg revealed that the most efficacious schedule is the more frequent dosing at Q3D. In comparing the total dose of 10 mg/kg per 14 day cycle, at varying dose per injection and frequency, AV-203 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition at all dose schedules. These data conclude that the efficacy of AV-203 is driven by total drug exposure and that AV-203 is not dependent on Cmax for its antitumor activity.']",

The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is thought to play a key role in anergy induction. IDO metabolizes tryptophan (trp) into immunosuppressive metabolites such as kynurenine (kyn). The oral IDO inhibitor, 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1MT), was studied in preclinical models. The preclinical data support the activity of 1-MT in preventing T-cell anergy in TDLN, slowing growth of LLC mouse xenografts, and synergizing with chemotherapy in regression of autochthonous breast tumors in MMTV-Neu mice.

Patient stratification in clinical trials based on molecular features has contributed to recent success of several targeted cancer drugs on molecular aberrations such as BCR-ABL translocation in CML, Her2 amplification in breast and gastric cancers, EGFR mutations and ALK fusions in lung cancer and BRAF mutation in melanoma. However, in most cancers, the molecular features which can be used for patient stratification are not as simple as a single genetic aberration. Multiple drug resistance mechanisms caused by various mutations in cancer signaling pathways can also increase the uncertainty of clinical outcomes.To increase the chance of success in human clinical studies, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) clinical trials (PCTs) have increasingly been used for predictive biomarker validation, resistance mechanism investigation and combination therapy selection. PDX tumor models have been demonstrated to have high correlations with human patients in tumor pathology, molecular characteristics and drug responses. Large scale PCTs have also shown consistency in results when compared to related human clinical trials.At GenenDesign, we have established over 1000 PDX tumor models and more than 100 resistance models against various cancer drugs.

        "Background":"['Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as an important class of cancer therapeutics. The FDA approval of Kadcyla (T-DM1), a single agent for treatment of HER2-positive advanced metastatic breast cancer, was a significant milestone in the field of targeted therapy, as the first and only ADC for treatment of solid tumors. Despite the 3-month improvement over standard of care in the median survival, almost all the patients eventually became refractory to T-DM1. We have identified several possible areas for improvement', ' 1) The potency of T-DM1 as confirmed by the Phase III clinical data is restricted to high HER2 tumors which leaves moderate or low HER2 expressing patients without access to T-DM1 treatment; 2) The 48% overall response rate is indicative of intrinsic resistance to T-DM1 and all T-DM1 treated patients eventually relapse. 3) The randomized lysine conjugation in T-DM1 generates heterogeneity of the product. We have developed a novel, site-specific anti-HER2 ADC (NG-HER2 ADC) and evaluated it in comparative preclinical studies with T-DM1. The results show that the NG-HER2 ADC is  10 fold more potent than T-DM1 in HER2 3+ xenograft models of breast and gastric cancers. Our proprietary cleavable and permeable linker-payload can mediate bystander effect and this enables potent anti-tumor activity in non-HER2 amplified breast cancer and heterogeneous low HER2 NSCLC PDX models, where T-DM1 is ineffective. Our ADC can overcome T-DM1 resistance in in vitro and in vivo models.. Our site-specific ADC at HNSTD of 9 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys showed high AUC, long half-life and had normal clinical observations with no marked neutropenia. On the contrary, conventional conjugates with cleavable linker payloads typically have severe bone marrow toxicity as DLT above 5 mg/kg. The therapeutic index for NG-HER2 ADC is significantly greater than T-DM1 in all models tested. NG-HER2 ADC has a projected clinical efficacious dose of 1 mg/kg, compared to 3-5 mg/kg for T-DM1, based on PK/PD modeling. In addition, the activity of the NG-HER2 ADC shows increased infiltration of CD8 positive effector cells, an essential component for immuno-oncology (IO) efficacy, in a syngeneic HER2 overexpressing model. This property potentially allows the combination of the ADC with IO drugs to improve the long-term, overall survival. Our data provides preclinical proof of concept for NG-HER2 ADC with best-in-class potential and is currently being tested in preparation for clinical trials for treatment of HER2 solid tumors.']",

        "Background":"['ERBB3 is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, that includes EGFR and HER2, well-established drivers of tumorigenesis. Recent preclinical studies indicate that both EGFR and HER2 cooperate with ERBB3 to activate the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt survival pathway and to promote tumor cell survival. Furthermore, ERBB3 activation has been demonstrated to mediate resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and to HER2 inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines. Consistent with these findings, anti-ERBB3 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to inhibit the growth of human tumor xenografts, demonstrating the importance of ERBB3 for tumor growth in vivo. REGN1400 is a fully-human anti-ERBB3 monoclonal antibody that binds human ERBB3 with high affinity (KD 50pM) and potently inhibits binding of the ERBB3 ligand neuregulin 1 (IC50 30pM). REGN1400 inhibited phosphorylation of ERBB3 and Akt in multiple human tumor cell lines in vitro, including A431 (epidermoid carcinoma), MDA-MB-175-VII (breast cancer) and FaDu (head and neck cancer). In addition, REGN1400 strongly inhibited the growth of these cell lines in vitro. Consistent with its potent effects on tumor cell growth in vitro, REGN1400 strongly inhibited the growth of A431 and FaDu tumor xenografts in a dose-dependent manner, providing 70% and 97% tumor growth inhibition, respectively. Inhibition of FaDu tumor growth by REGN1400 was accompanied by a significant decrease in tumor ERBB3 phosphorylation, as assessed by both western blot and immunohistochemistry, confirming target inhibition in vivo. While treatment of FaDu tumors with single agent REGN1400 provided almost complete tumor growth inhibition, but not regression, the combination of REGN1400 plus anti-EGFR antibody caused significant tumor regression. Furthermore, combination treatment with REGN1400 plus the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab inhibited the growth of BT474 breast tumor xenografts more potently than either single agent. These findings indicate that ERBB3-directed therapies might be more effective when combined with agents that inhibit other ERBB family members. Finally, gene profiling studies in REGN1400-treated tumor cells revealed upregulation of several genes that could promote resistance to REGN1400, e.g., ERBB3 itself and ERBB4. Further analysis of tumor gene expression changes induced by REGN1400 could provide insight into potentially useful combination regimens. In summary, REGN1400, a novel anti-ERBB3 antibody, exhibits significant antitumor activity in preclinical models, suggesting the possibility that it could provide benefit to patients with multiple types of cancer, either as a single agent or when combined with therapies targeting other ERBB family members.']",

Based on this data, a phase IB trial was designed to study the safety of the combination of docetaxel (Doc) and indoximod. The primary goal of this trial was to determine the MTD for the combination of Doc and oral indoximod. Secondary endpoints were PK data and efficacy for indoximod/Doc.  Methods', '  This phase IB study consisted of 5 dose levels (DL). Doc was dosed IV q 3 wks at 60 mg/m2 in DL 1-4 and 75 mg/m2 at DL 5. Indoximod was dosed at 300, 600, 1,000, 2,000, and 1,200 mg PO BID continuously in DL 1-5 respectively. MTD was determined using a 3+3 design. The DLT rule was 1st cycle G3 non-heme AEs or G4 heme AEs despite supportive care or that delay therapy >14d. The PK of indoximod and Doc was analyzed using a HPLC assay.

        "Meeting_name":" Multiplex assay in FFPE tissues to simultaneously quantify the human EGF receptor (HER1-4) family proteins",
        "Background":"[\"The human EGF receptor family (HER's) consists of two clinically validated drug targets (EGFR (HER1) and HER2), and two receptors (HER3 and HER4) which are the subject of intensive preclinical and early clinical investigation. Although drugs inhibiting both EGFR and HER2 show significant antitumor activity in the clinic, the acquisition of resistance is a hallmark of these and other targeted therapies. In the case of both targets, one of the emerging resistance mechanisms is the co-expression of other members of the EGFR superfamily. It was recently shown that HER2 co-expression mediates resistance in EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab) treated head and neck cancer (Sci Transl Med 7(3)99). Similarly, much attention has been paid to HER3 both as a bona fide drug target as well as a resistance mechanism (Oncogene 27, 3944). Finally, HER4, though less well studied may play a role in drug response (Breast Cancer Research 11\", 'R50). We have previously build HER1 and HER2 specific SRM assays. HER3 is usually expressed at much lower levels than EGFR and HER2 (often <10%). Yet, receptor crosstalk and heterodimerization can allow even very low levels of HER3 to exert a large impact on drug response. According to one report (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 19(4)', '982), IHC analysis of HER3 may be inadequate to properly quantitate HER3 expression in FFPE tumor tissues. This antibody inadequacy may be a result of high sequence homology/identity between HER3 and other HER family members. Due to the critical need to accurately quantitate this receptor, we have used a mass spectrometric approach to develop a specific and quantitative SRM assay for HER3 from FFPE tumor tissue. These preclinical studies are being extended by assessing the expression levels of the complete HER family in two cohorts of clinical tumor tissue which had been treated with HER family antagonists. First, we measured HER3 expression in a set of neoadjuvant gefitinib treated NSCLC tumors. In this cohort, 12/15 tumor showed low but measurable levels of HER3 expression, ranging from 50-100 amol/ug tumor tissue. In a second tissue set, we measured HER3 expression in a cohort of advanced (Stage III-IV) breast cancer tissues which had undergone post resection adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab. These breast cancer samples demonstrated a higher level of expression of HER3, ranging from 50 - 250amol/ug tumor tissue, and 15/18 tumors were HER3 positive. In both studies, the relationship between HER family expression and response to either gefitinib or trastuzumab is currently under study. Analysis of HER4 in these cohorts is ongoing. It is critically important to understand mechanisms of resistance in patients undergoing targeted therapies, and Liquid Tissue-SRM promises to be a platform which can deliver extremely high sensitivity, absolute specificity as well as multiplexing capabilities to assess the four HER family targets in unison.']",

        "Background":"['In lung adenocarcinomas, targeted therapy with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib is associated with longer progression free survival (PFS) and higher radiographic response (RR) rates when compared to standard first-line chemotherapy. In ALK rearranged lung cancers, targeted therapy with crizotinib is associated with PFS of approximately 9,7 months and RR of 60.8%. However, despite the initial success of these agents, all patients progress with a median PFS of 7 to 16 months. Acquired resistance in EGFR mutant tumors is driven by the occurrence of a secondary EGFR mutation (T790M) in about 50% of the cases and by MET amplification in 5 to 10 % of the cases. Other mechanisms include HER2 amplification, PTEN loss, phenotypic change to small cell histology, rare mutations in BRAF and AXL activation. Resistance to crizotinib, on the other hand, is caused by secondary mutations in the ALK kinase domain, by ALK or cKIT amplification or by alterations in EGFR and KRAS. Here, we made use of next generation sequencing techniques to better understand the mechanisms that drive resistance in lung adenocarcinomas treated with erlotinib or crizotinib. For this purpose, we used transbronchial or CT-guided rebiopsies from patients that had either prolonged stable disease or partial response to therapy, and developed radiographic progression under TKI therapy. Samples were analyzed by FISH and sequenced on a benchtop Illumina platform (MiSeq) in order to evaluate the presence of known mechanisms of resistance. Samples that were negative for any of the reported mechanisms were analyzed by genome, exome or trascriptome sequencing. From the sequencing output of the pan-negative samples, filtering of mutation candidates included', ' absence of the mutation in the pre-treatment sample (when available), expression of the candidate gene in lung adenocarcinomas, absence of the mutation in primary lung adenocarcinomas, high impact of the mutation at protein level (Polyphen), mutant allelic fraction in the tumor higher than 10%, among other factors. After filtering, validation of mutation calls was performed by Sanger sequencing. Sequencing of the erlotinib resistant samples revealed mutations in members of a functionally wide spectrum of protein families including the proteoglycan family, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters family, an Fms-related tyrosine kinase receptor and a member of the transforming growth factor beta family of cytokines. On the other hand, crizotinib resistant samples showed mutations in a cell surface receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein with tyrosine kinase activity, in a C2H2 type zinc finger gene, a semaphorin, a mitogen-activated protein kinase and a member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins. Our results evidence the possible contribution of a wide range of cellular pathways in the process of acquired resistance to EGFR and ALK inhibitors in lung adenocarcinomas.']",

We analyzed the status of methylation, mutation, copy number gains (CNGs), and protein expression in representative genes and the sensitivity to several drugs in these 4 cell lines. We detected the complete methylation of P16 in 3 cell lines, in which the protein expression of p16 was lost. Methylation of RASSF1A was observed in 3 of 4 cell lines. Copy number gains (CNGs) in EGFR, HER2 and MET were not detected in all the cell lines. Mutations in various genes including EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, and PIK3CA, which are frequently detected in non-small cell lung cancer, were not detected in all 4 cell lines. As for microRNA, miR-34b/c was completely methylated in 2 of 4 MPM established cell lines. About cell adhesion molecules, E-cadherin expression was detected in two epithelioid type MPM cell lines, whereas N-cadherin expression was detected in all four established cell lines by Western blot analysis. Vimentin was strongly expressed in two sarcomatoid type MPM cell lines. All established MPM cell lines showed no dramatic responses to the drugs tested including NVP-AUY922, 17-DMAG, Trichostatin A and Vorinostat. Although new molecular findings were not observed in the process of the current characterization of these new MPM cell lines, they seem to be useful for the future extensive analyses of biological behavior of MPM, so as to the development of new therapeutic strategies.']",

In our HER2 program, we have used these linker-duocarmycin payloads to generate HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCS) and prepare these for FIM studies. HER2 is a validated target in breast (BC) and gastric cancer (GC) that is currently used to target trastuzumab towards HER2-positive BC and GC tumors. We have generated a set of cysteine-coupled ADCs using newly developed duocarmycins conjugated to a therapeutic HER2/neu antibody. In vitro studies with the anti-Her2 ADCs showed that compared to the naked Ab, the ADCs tested have gained a more than 100-fold potency and more than two-fold efficacy in cell killing capacity. Studies in HER2 positive and negative cell lines indicated that cytotoxicity was HER2- mediated. HER2 binding and ADCC activity was not affected by conjugation. Single dose and multiple dose xenograft studies in mice using a human HER2-positive breast cancer cell line showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activity of the ADCs in vivo. Patient-derived xenografts (PDx) using primary tumors from HER2-positive breast cancer and NSCLC patients demonstrated the ability of the ADC to induce complete remission of tumors that remained unresponsive to the naked Ab trastuzumab. Also taken into account toxicology studies in rodents and cynomolgous monkeys, we conclude that we have generated a new class of HER2-based ADCs that have great potential to become effective treatment for HER2-positive tumors, including breast cancer and NSCLC.

Afatinib is an irreversible inhibitor of the Erb family approved for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. Afatinib downregulates thymidine synthase (TS) the intracellular target of fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy such as capecitabine. Treatment of colorectal cancer cell lines with cytotoxic drugs can up-regulate EGFR expression, and increase sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Based on this preclinical rationale, and given that capecitabine is commonly used in refractory gastrointestinal cancers, we have developed a phase I/Ib trial to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of afatinib with capecitabine in advanced solid tumors, and assess preliminary antitumor activity in pts with refractory pancreatico-biliary cancers at MTD.

        "Meeting_name":" Met-dependent positive and negative signaling cascades in gastric cancer cells",
        "Background":"['Signaling by the Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activates multiple downstream signaling pathways that promote cell migration and invasive growth. Cells that overexpress and are addicted to Met also require Met signaling to sustain cell survival. Thus, a number of specific small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target Met in the clinic. Although several successes of RTK-targeted therapies are acknowledged, several have limited long-term success clinically, due to development of drug resistance. Initiation of RTK signaling cascades leads to the activation of a number of downstream signaling molecules, but prolonged activation also triggers negative feedback loops that function in part to abrogate this signaling. Hence, targeted inhibition of Met, in addition to suppressing Met-dependent signaling, may also release cells from negative feedback mechanisms and allow the reactivation of signaling pathways, that may promote resistance to Met inhibition. As MET amplification occurs in 10-20% of gastric cancers, to identify core Met dependent signaling pathways activated in Met dependent cancers we have used four different gastric cancer cell lines that exhibit amplification, overexpression, and constitutive activation of Met. Upon inhibition of Met with a small-molecule inhibitor, we observe abrogation of several downstream signaling pathways at both the protein phosphorylation and transcript level. Interestingly, as Met has been demonstrated to cross-talk with the EGF receptor family, we also observe a decrease in the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER3 upon treatment with Met inhibitor, and a decrease in expression of EGFR ligands. Conversely, Met inhibition results in an elevation in expression of HER3 transcript and protein in all 4 cell lines, implicating Met signaling in HER3 repression, and inhibition of Met may release HER3 from this negative regulation. As increases in HER3 phosphorylation and expression occur in other models (such as breast or lung cancer cell lines) upon treatment with EGFR, HER2, or AKT inhibitors, and high HER3 expression is strongly associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in gastric cancer; hence, the loss of negative regulation of HER3, downstream from Met, may ultimately contribute to clinical efficacy, or lack thereof, of Met inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Sym013 represents a novel HER family targeting approach consisting of a mixture of six monoclonal antibodies against EGFR, HER2, and HER3. Sym013 effectively induces rapid, simultaneous down-regulation of all HER members. Compared with single receptor or dual receptor targeting of the HER family, Sym013 provides broader inhibition and greater down-regulation efficacy. In this current study, we examined the capacity of Sym013 in combination with ionizing radiation to augment tumor response in lung (NSCLC) and head and neck (HNSCC) cancer model systems.The anti-proliferative effects of Sym013 were confirmed showing 30-60% growth inhibition across a variety of NSCLC and H&N cancer cell lines that express EGFR, HER2, and/or HER3. Furthermore, Sym013 inhibited the growth of tumor cells that exhibit resistance to cetuximab. Western blot analysis showed a dose-dependent down-regulation of HER family members and downstream MAPK and AKT signaling pathways following 24-hour treatment with Sym013. Clonogenic survival analysis revealed that Sym013 enhanced radiosensitivity in tumor cells following radiation exposure. We characterized the DNA damage profile following radiation via flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylated histone 2AX (H2AX) foci. This revealed a significant increase of H2AX following treatment with Sym013 and 2 Gy radiation when compared with Sym013 or radiation alone. Furthermore, combined treatment of Sym013 and radiation induced a significant G1 and G2 arrest. Using Annexin V/PI staining, we also found a significant increase in the apoptotic cell population following treatment of Sym013 and 6 Gy radiation. These results suggest that Sym013 augments radiation response via the induction of cell cycle arrest followed by the induction of apoptosis and cell death, likely reflecting inhibitory effects on DNA damage repair. Additional studies to examine the impact of Sym013 to augment radiation response as well as overcome acquired resistance to cetuximab in xenograft models are in progress. Overall, these data suggest the significant capacity of Sym013 to augment radiation response in lung and head and neck cancers. This unique antibody mixture warrants additional investigation as a promising novel HER family targeting strategy in cancer therapy.']",

        "Meeting_name":" A cellular model of acquired resistance to rilotumumab (AMG 102) in glioblastoma.",
        "Background":"['Acquired drug resistance is a long-standing problem of cancer therapeutics. The issue has become even more vexing with the development of highly selective agents; resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib is acquired frequently in lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, anticipating acquired resistance and understanding its basis may help us develop strategies to prevent or circumvent occurrence. Through its receptor tyrosine kinase Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis during development and adulthood. HGF/Met signaling also contributes to cancer progression in many malignancies, including glioblastoma. Rilotumumab is a fully human neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HGF tested in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, including mono therapy in renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, as well as combination trials in gastric, colorectal, small cell lung cancers and castrate resistant prostate cancer.To generate a cellular model of acquired resistance to rilotumumab, an HGF/Met dependent human glioblastoma-derived cell line (U87-MG) was grown in rilotumumab (600 nM) for 120 days. Growth rate, HGF secretion, Met content and Met activation state were 10-fold, 10,000-fold, 10-fold and 80-fold higher than the parental cell values, respectively. The HGF and MET coding sequences were normal in both parental and resistant cells. Quantitative PCR studies to determine mRNA levels of all HGF isoforms revealed a dramatic increase in full-length HGF transcript. CGH array studies indicated amplification within both HGF and MET genes. Xenograft studies confirmed that tumor growth was resistant to rilotumumab, however the resistant cell line and tumors remained sensitive to a highly selective Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that resistance was achieved via increased HGF/Met signaling rather than mutation or activation of alternate pathways. Microarray expression analysis demonstrated transcript profiles that were consistent with HGF/Met pathway activation. Thus the molecular basis of acquired resistance in this model differs from those prevalent in', ' [1] lung cancers treated with EGFR inhibitors and medulloblastomas treated with hedgehog inhibitors, where most cases acquire secondary mutations in the targeted kinase; [2] breast cancers treated with HER2 inhibitors, where PTEN loss, p27 downregulation, and activation of other receptors are primary causes; or [3] malignant melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors, where increased signaling via multiple pathways lead to PI3K- and/or MEK-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway. In addition to the importance of HGF/Met pathway activity in selecting glioblastoma patients for HGF-targeted therapeutics, our results suggest that monitoring Met pathway activity could provide early indications of acquired resistance to these agents, and that Met kinase inhibitors may still be efficacious when resistance occurs.']",

Hypoxia-induced activation of WT EGFR signaling may be a mechanism of EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. TRLX is a hypoxia-activated prodrug that releases an irreversible pan-ErbB TKI targeting WT EGFR, MT EGFR and HER2. Hypoxic tumor targeting using TRLX may allow a greater therapeutic index with greater intratumoral TKI exposure and less dose-limiting systemic toxicity compared to currently available EGFR TKIs.

Conclusions', ' In pts who were driver unknown or who had clinical concern for tumor heterogeneity, plasma ctDNA NGS identified a variety of oncogenic drivers with a short turnaround time and matched them to targeted therapy. Plasma ctDNA detection was more frequent at diagnosis of metastatic disease or at progression. A positive finding of an oncogenic driver in plasma is highly specific, but a negative finding may still require tissue biopsy.']",

Extensive crosstalk seen among these receptors implies that blocking signaling of more than one receptor may be more effective in inhibiting tumor growth and circumventing resistance mechanisms than targeting individual receptors. In particular, HER3 is considered a key mediator of resistance to many targeted agents. We generated a two-in-one antibody, MEHD7945A, that binds to EGFR and HER3 with high affinity, inhibits receptor function and is more broadly efficacious in various tumor types when compared to monospecific anti-EGFR or anti-HER3 antibodies.

The androgen receptor (AR), a key driver of prostate cancer growth and treatment resistance, is an HSP90 client and its function is dependent on HSP90 chaperone activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-tumour activity of AT13387, a novel second generation non-ansamycin HSP90 inhibitor, in prostate cancer models. AT13387 is currently being investigated in the clinic in GIST and NSCLC. It is a potent inhibitor of HSP90 (Kd 0.71 nM) and has previously been shown to inhibit proliferation and bring about the depletion of client proteins in a wide range of cell lines as well as inhibiting tumor growth in a number of xenograft models. In prostate cancer cell lines (VCaP, LNCaP, 22Rv1), AT13387 treatment depleted HSP90 clients such as AKT, HER-2 and CRAF, along with the induction of HSP72, confirming target inhibition. AT13387 treatment also resulted in depletion of mutant and wild-type AR, as well as the constitutively active truncated AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7). HSP90 inhibition disrupted AR nuclear localisation and AR transcriptional activity and resulted in down-regulation of AR-regulated genes in vitro. Inhibition of HSP90 translated into proliferative inhibition, with GI50 values in the range of 15-70 nM, and induction of apoptosis. AT13387 showed substantially greater potency than the first generation, natural product-based HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG in modulating HSP90 client proteins, inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell death. The anti-tumor activity of AT13387 was demonstrated in vivo in a human xenograft model of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our data suggest that HSP90 inhibition, through the use of more potent and better tolerated HSP90 inhibitors, will be active in multi drug resistant prostate cancer.

We previously identified 20 candidate driver genes in Chromosome 3q26-29, a critical amplified region in many human cancers including breast and lung cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic power of this 20-gene signature in TNBC patients. 855 breast tumors combined from four breast cancer cohorts (GSE12276, GSE2603, GSE2034 and NKI295) were used to evaluate the signature for prediction of organ-specific distant metastasis free survival (DMFS). The predictive ability of the 20-gene signature was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards model and was compared against other published breast cancer gene signatures including MammaPrint (70-gene), Veridex (76-gene), PAM50, 54 lung metastasis signature genes, HIF1 hypoxia pathway (8-gene), TGF  pathway (153-gene), BACH1 pathway metastasis gene signature (25-gene) and Gene Expression Prognostic Index Using Subtypes (GENIUS).

This trend has led to a proliferation of focused biomarker tests delivered using a variety of technologies, which are generally restricted in their breadth of mutational status assessment and constrained by scarce tissue material. We deployed massively parallel sequencing (or NGS) technology to develop a pan-cancer, comprehensive genomic profiling assay interrogating 189 relevant cancer genes, using minimal DNA from fixed surgical or biopsy specimens. With this assay we identify all classes of DNA alterations (base substitutions, insertions and deletions, copy number alterations and rearrangements at specific loci) in a single test with high sensitivity and specificity. To assess the potential for comprehensive genomic profiling to inform clinical decisions, we sequenced 58 archival FFPE tumor specimens, including 16 breast, 16 colon, 14 lung, and 12 renal cell cancers to an average of depth of 850x and considered the resultant mutation profiles in the context of current treatment guidelines and clinical trial information. In total, 121 mutations and 30 copy number alterations were identified, of which less than one third could be identified by traditional hotspot analysis. The observed mutation frequencies were consistent with published studies for these tissue types', ' 56% of breast cancers carried TP53 mutations, 38% had PIK3CA mutations, and 13% harbored HER2 amplifications. In colon cancers, 75% and 63% carried APC and TP53 mutations, while 38%, 31%, and 25% harbored KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations respectively. Finally, 57% and 42% of NSCLCs carried mutations in TP53 and KRAS, while 17% of RCCs had mutations in VHL. Nearly 70% of the 58 cases carried one or more mutations that could plausibly confer sensitivity or resistance to approved or experimental targeted therapies. Of these potentially clinically actionable mutations, 57% occurred at known sites of oncogene activation, 27% involved gene amplification or deletion, 14% resulted in tumor suppressor loss, and one resulted in the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Our results demonstrate technical feasibility of comprehensive cancer gene characterization through massively parallel sequencing in clinical FFPE specimens. The prevalence and diversity of potentially actionable mutations we observed highlights the benefits of adopting this approach. As massively-parallel sequencing is the only practical means to detect all classes of somatic mutation in a small, clinically relevant sample, we suggest that this type of testing will be an essential ingredient in bringing targeted therapies to cancer patient care.']",

Apoptosis can be considered as a threshold, and we have designed a tool, BH3 profiling, that can measure mitochondrial priming for death, essentially the proximity of a cell to the this threshold of apoptosis. When effective death signaling is initiated by a targeted therapy, dynamic BH3 profiling can be used to measure the increase in mitochondrial priming caused by the agent within hours, without the requirement for prolonged ex vivo culture.

Rociletinib was designed to spare wild-type EGFR signaling. Heavily-pretreated T790M+ patients treated with rociletinib at 500 or 625mg BID demonstrated a 67% objective response rate (n = 56, Soria et al., ENA 2014). Adverse events (AEs) typical of wild-type EGFR inhibition, such as cutaneous toxicities, have not been observed.

Rociletinib does not directly play a role in hyperglycemia based on kinase and cellular profiling, toxicology studies performed in Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in Sprague-Dawley rats. We examined the hypothesis that hyperglycemia may result from a metabolite of rociletinib. Metabolite profiling from in vitro hepatocyte incubations, as well as the analysis of plasma samples from healthy subjects and NSCLC patients, revealed three metabolites of interest referenced according to their protonated molecular ion', ' M460, M502, and M544.

Expanded cellular profiling revealed that M460 and M502 have 2-3 fold and 3-7 fold greater potency against INSR and IGF1R, respectively, as compared to rociletinib, whereas metabolite M544 demonstrated similar or reduced potency. Metabolite profiling in rats suggests that M502 is rapidly converted to M544 by acetylation, thus a rat OGTT was performed with a single dose of M502 at 1000 mg/kg to reach exposure levels comparable to those observed in rociletinib treated NSCLC patient samples. Metabolite M502 caused significant elevations in post-prandial glucose and insulin excursion.

Most NSCLCs with target undergo at least some regression although the degree varies between patients due to largely unexplored factors. Many mechanisms of acquired resistance have been defined, including outgrowth of subclones with secondary mutations or alternative pathways, and pharmacological effects & sanctuaries. Available data suggest that resistant cells are present in small numbers in the initial tumor but that their growth is suppressed by the more rapidly growing parent tumor cells until this parent population is itself suppressed by TKI initiation. If TKI is stopped due to progression, there can be tumor flare as the initial parent cell population regrows rapidly. Exponential decay nonlinear regression analysis of patient survival curves suggests that TKI discontinuation at time of progression may partially synchronize patient deaths. Initial tumor progression may occur in a single site. Available data indicate that focal treatment (eg, radiation) to that site combined with continuation of initial TKI may give optimal control and reduce tumor flare. Of interest, progression may occur in many sites concurrently. Since there are many potential resistance mechanisms one might expect substantial discordance of resistance mechanisms between these sites, but preliminary data with 2nd line agents (eg, anti-T790M agents in EGFR-mutant patients and 2nd generation anti-ALK agents for acquired resistance to crizotinib) indicate response in most sites if any are sensitive, suggesting that all or most sites have a common resistance mechanism. This raises the possibility that an initial resistant site is seeding other distant tumor sites with resistant cells, in keeping with animal data. The probability of a resistant cell being present in an individual tumor deposit is proportional to the total number of tumor cells in that deposit. If 1 area of resistant tumor can seed other tumor areas with resistant cells, then (particularly in oligometastatic disease) we should consider clinical trials exploring', ' 1) at initiation of TKI therapy treating as many tumor sites as possible (particularly large tumors) with a modality (eg radiation) that is indifferent to the factors giving TKI resistance; 2) treating any progressing lesions as early as possible with intensive focal therapy, if feasible, rather than waiting until symptomatic or rather than treating only with low palliative doses.Conclusion', ' Extrapolation from available data suggests we should explore trials using multifocal radiation at initiation of TKIs for advanced NSCLC and early, intense treatment of areas of isolated progression.']",

        "Background":"['Backgroud', ' The molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90(Hsp90) governs the stabilization and activity of an array of over 100 client proteins, many of which are key signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation, survival, and transformation. A significant number of these client proteins are oncogenic in nature, including the protein kinases Her2, C-Raf, B-Raf, and AKT. We report here that IDH1057 is structurally distinct from a geldanamycin derivative, tanespimycin(17-AAG) as a novel and potent small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor that binds to the NH2-terminal ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90. Results', ' IDH1057 exhibited superior binding affinity for the ATPase domain of Hsp90(IDH1057, human Hsp90 FP IC50<150 nM) compared to 17-AAG(IC50 =456.3 nM) in vitro. IDH1057 also markedly inhibited proliferation in a broad panel of human tumor cell lines(IC50100 nM) and depleted Her2 in SKBR3 breast cancer cells(IC50<50 nM). 10 NSCLC cell lines were relatively sensitive to IDH1057, irrespective of EGFR, Her2 or KRAS mutational status. IDH1057 was also highly effective against cell lines that displayed resistance to erlotinib. IDH1057 efficiently inhibited cell proliferation in 8 breast cancer cell lines including triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) cell lines such as BT-20, Hs578T and MDA-MB-231. Exposure to IDH1057 led to a rapid and dramatic degradation of key signaling molecules in BT474 cells. Based on these results, we examined in vivo anti-tumor activity of IDH1057 in BT474 breast cancer xenografts. Following once daily oral dosing of IDH1057 at 200mg/kg on a weekly 5-day-on and 2-day-off schedule for 4 weeks, this compound showed statistically significant tumor growth inhibition(TGI=84.5%) and was well-tolerated with no observable body weight loss. A2780 ovarian cancer xenografts in mice treated orally with IDH1057 also resulted in potent tumor growth inhibition. More importantly, IDH1057 displayed favorable oral PK profiles in mice. Additionally, we performed in vitro ADME assays to characterize a new series of small molecule inhibitors. IDH1057 exhibited high metabolic stability in liver microsomes from human, mouse and beagle(60%). Five human CYP isoforms were not significantly inhibited by IDH1057 at 10uM. IDH1057 had moderate permeability in MDCK permeability assay(Papp=4.7x106 cm/sec). Conclusion', ' Our results indicate that IDH1057 is a novel and fully synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor with strong anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo.

        "Background":"['Background', '  hTERT, the human catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, is highly expressed in breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Peptides derived from hTERT can be recognized on MHC by cytotoxic T cells and mediate tumor death. In preclinical studies, TERT DNA delivered with electroporation (EP) triggered an immune response in vivo that slowed tumor growth in HPV16-associated tumor-bearing mice. The advantages of DNA-based immunotherapy include (1) strong immunogenicity exceeding those achieved by viral vectors; (2) non infectiousness of the immunogen; (3) ability for repeated dosing; and (4) relatively low cost. EP can be used to optimally and safely deliver DNA in vivo by creating a transient electric field to enhance the cellular uptake of large molecules such as DNA. Addition of IL-12 to hTERT significantly enhanced immune responses in preclinical models.

        "Background":"[\"AEG1 is highly expressed in solid tumors; hyperexpression confers multidrug resistance, increased tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastatic potential and poor outcome in most solid tumors. AEG1 activates multiple protumorogenic signal transduction pathways like PIK3/ALT, NFKB, MAMPK, WNT and is a rational target for therapeutic intervention in solid tumors.Also AEG1 functionality is instrumental in the natural history of brain tumors. Our data in NSCLCs confirm AEG1 overexpression as the main parameter (uni and multivariate analysis) indicative of outcome to targeted and cytotoxic therapy. We designed an in silico model based on inhibition of AEG1-p65 crosstalk, identifying a possible interacting interface between the 2 proteins that could be modeled as a three-dimensional structure. This interface was further reduced and transformed into a 3-point pharmacophore for virtual screening comparing both molecular interaction fields and the pharmacophore. A total of 217.000 chemical entities (CEs) were tested in this model giving a Hercules affinity ranking. Sixty CEs with the highest Hercules ranking were identified for a second (16 CEs) and third (5 CEs) selection to implement the first round of in vitro studies in our human solid tumor panel. Twenty analogs were generated to seek for a lead according to prospective selection criteria. PB0412-3 (PB3), a small molecule polyheterocyclic compound, was selected for further development. PB3 displays antitumor activity in the human solid tumor panel (median IC50 1.3 uM) and PB3-induced growth inhibition appears independent of EGFR, KRAS & p53 mutational status, Her2 amplification, PIK3 mutations and BRCA1 expression;tumor cell lines bearing highest AEG1-mRNA expression levels were sensititive to PB3. Median IC50 in our glioblastoma (GBM) panel was 60 nM with no impact of MGMT methylation status on PB3's molar potency (MP). IC50s delta solid vs brain tumors were significant (p<.0001) representing a 25-fold increase in MP. Data from nitrosureas in the same GBM panel indicate PB3 is 250 times more potent than BCNU and temozolamide. Median IC50s in human non cancer lines is 2 uM. PB3 was re-screened in the in silico model; PB3 fully matches the AEG1 binder pharmacophore model and was screened in the Chemical Space web tool; results confirm PB3 as first-in-class CE. Functional studies are ongoing; preliminary data in PC9 NSCLC cell line demonstrate significant PB3-induced downregulation of AEG1 mRNA expression. Expansion of the CNS tumor panel, cell kinetics, drug-induced cell death & in vivo/PK-PD studies in SC orthotopic models is ongoing.

        "Background":"['We recently reported that a family of nucleoside analogues (sangivamycin-like molecules) can sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL through dual blockade of CDK1 and GSK3-beta (Mayes et al., Cancer Research, 2011). We further reported that CDK inhibitors can destabilize HIF1-alpha regardless of VHL or p53 status or the presence of hypoxia (Warfel et al., Cell Cycle, 2013). In order to translate this knowledge into a cancer therapeutic strategy, we investigated the effects of CDK inhibition in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with or without chemotherapy. PD-0332991 (Palbociclib) is a specific inhibitor of CDK4/6 that has been tested in numerous clinical trials for breast cancer, NSCLC, GBM, lymphoma, leukemia, in combination with 5-FU and oxaliplatin in solid malignancies (NCT01522989) or with cetuximab in head and neck cancer (NCT02101034). Palbociclib was approved by the FDA in 2015 in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine therapy for post-menopausal women with ER(+)/Her2(-) breast cancer. Little is known about the effects of CDK4/6 inhibition in CRC. We investigated the therapeutic effect and anti-proliferative mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibition in CRC. We used CellTiter-Glo assays to detect CRC cell viability and determined IC50 values (50% inhibitory concentration) of single drug through nonlinear regression analysis by GraphPad Prism software. The combination index (CI) of multiple drug combinations was identified with Compusyn analysis. We found that Palbociclib promotes cell death of CRC cells under hypoxia but not under normoxia where Palbociclib inhibited cell proliferation via the pRb pathway. These results suggest that the CDK4/6 inhibitor could regulate cell fate of CRC via different molecular mechanisms under hypoxia versus normoxia. We further found that Palbociclib can upregulate ERK/MAPK signaling under hypoxia, as compared with normoxia. The IC50 values of Palbociclib were generally higher under hypoxia (Mean  SD', ' 10.54  3.35 M, N = 5) versus normoxia (Mean  SD', ' 6.61  0.85 M, N = 5) in CRC cell lines. Thus, hypoxia promotes resistance of CRC cells toward the cytotoxic activity of the CDK4/6 inhibitor. We found that Palbociclib synergizes with CPT-11 much better than with either 5-FU or oxaliplatin against CRC cell lines with different molecular subtypes. Based on our findings that Palbociclib can promote cell death of CRC cells under hypoxia and synergizes with CPT11, further investigation is needed to assess the novel combination therapy against CRC.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Triple-negative (ER, PR, HER2 negative) breast cancer represents an unmet need for which novel agents and approaches are essential. Entinostat is an orally available, class 1 isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor currently in multiple phase 2 clinical studies including advanced NSCLC and breast cancer. Studies in vitro and in vivo in the triple negative cell line model MDA-MB-231 have established single agent activity of entinostat in inhibiting tumor growth as well preventing bone metastases. In addition, entinostat induces expression of ER in MDA-MB-231 in vivo and is synergistic with endocrine therapy agents to inhibit tumor growth of ER negative cancer cells. The aim of these studies was to confirm the activity of entinostat in triple negative breast cancers using human breast tumor explants. Methods', ' Cytotoxicity of entinostat was determined by the Oncotech Extreme Drug Resistance (EDR) proliferation assay using ten cryopreserved breast tumor explants known to lack estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2/neu expression (i.e. Triple negative) by immunohistochemistry. Results', ' Dose response curves of entinostat were analyzed and compared to paclitaxel at 2.45 M in ten triple negative breast tumor explants in the EDR assay. Entinostat was broadly effective in all of the tumors tested, with most samples showing dose-dependent response for the range of concentrations analyzed (0.003 - 10 M). Two of the breast tumors that were most sensitive to entinostat (IC50 30- 100nM) were also sensitive to paclitaxel. In contrast, entinostat effectively inhibited (IC50 10-270nM) the growth of eight of the tumors that were resistant to paclitaxel (i.e. < 50% growth inhibition). Overall, all breast tumors tested were sensitive to entinostat at clinically achievable concentrations regardless of paclitaxel resistance indicating entinostat may improve the treatment outcome of triple negative breast cancer patients. Conclusions', \" Entinostat is an effective agent at inhibiting the growth of triple negative breast tumors with clinically relevant IC50's ranging from 10nM to 270nM. A pre-surgical clinical study to assess the activity of entinostat in triple negative breast cancer patients is planned.\"]",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' We recently reported the synthesis and characterization of NOSH-aspirin a highly potent hybrid; that releases both nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) two important signalling molecules of physiological relevance. The present study was undertaken to unravel some of the underlying mechanisms of its action. Methods', ' Cell lines', ' MCF-7 (ER+), MDA-MB-231 (ER-, PR-, does not over express Her2), HMEpC, normal human mammary epithelial; Cell growth', ' MTT; Cell cycle phase distribution', ' Apoptosis and cell cycle', ' Flow cytometry; Proliferation', ' PCNA; ROS', ' measured hydrogen peroxide and super oxide by flow cytometry using DCFDA and DHE dyes. Xenografts', ' NuNu mice (N=5/group) implanted with MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231, after 10 days randomly divided animals and gavaged daily with NOSH-ASA (100 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle. Tumor volume and animal weight were recorded every 3 days. After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed, tumors excised, weighed, and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Results', \" NOSH-aspirin's IC50 in nM at 24h for cell growth inhibition were MCF-7 (28520), MDA-MB-231 (989), HMEpC (20,0003,000); aspirin's IC50 in all cell lines was greater than 5,000,000 nM at 24h. Cell proliferation at 2xIC50 was decreased 314 % in ER+ cells and 27.8 2% in ER- cells. This was accompanied by a G0-G1 phase cell cycle arrest (59.5% at IC50 for ER+ cells and 66.3% at IC50 for ER- cells). NOSH-aspirin at the doses studied, did not cause appreciable apoptosis at 24hr, at 2xIC50 the values being 32.73% in ER(+) and 242% in ER(-) cells. These results are in line with our data showing that in PC9 lung cancer cells stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP (used for mitochondrial cytochrome c release) NOSH-aspirin caused partial release of cytochrome c up to 3 hours when followed in real -time by fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. NOSH-ASA increased intracellular H2O2 and superoxide anions. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetylcysteine, blocked these. Xenografts\", ' NOSH-aspirin had no effect on the weight of the mice and there were no overt signs of toxicity. Tumor volume was reduced as a function of treatment time. The growth rate of ER(-) xenografts was significantly greater than that of ER(+) ones and NOSH-aspirin had a greater effect on the ER(-) vs ER(+) xenografts. Tumor mass for each group were, ER(+)', ' 0.460.056g untreated and 0.210.035g treated, (55% reduction, P=0.022), ER(-)', ' 1.20.33g untreated and 0.110.058g treated (91% reduction, P=0.006). NOSH-aspirin inhibited growth of these cancer cell xenografts as a result of reduced proliferation (decreased PCNA expression), and induction apoptosis (increased number of TUNEL positive cells), and induction of ROS. Conclusions', ' NOSH-aspirin preferentially affects cancer cells and has potent anti-cancer properties. It targets parameters important in determining cellular mass and merits further evaluation.Citation Format', ' Diandra E. Nesbitt, Mitali Chattopadhyay, Federica Vannini, Thuy-Tien C.

        "Background":"['Background', '  Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is an oral, irreversible ErbB family blocker. This trial prospectively evaluated the possible proarrhythmic potential of afatinib by assessing QTc interval, as well as its PK and clinical efficacy.   Methods', '  Patients (pts) with tumors known to overexpress EGFR or HER2, including those with brain metastases and GBM were eligible for treatment with daily afatinib 50mg. Pts with a QTcF-interval >470 ms, a PR-interval >230 ms, a QRS-interval >120 ms and ST-segment and T/U-wave abnormalities at screening, as assessed by central cardiology review, were excluded. 60 pts were treated. Time-matched 24-h ECGs were performed prior to drug exposure, after single dose and at steady state. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were drawn on days coincident with ECGs.  Results', '    49 of 60 pts were analyzed for the QTcF. The largest mean time matched QTcF change from baseline to Day 14 was 1.6 ms (90% CI 2.1, 5.2) at 1 h post dosing. The analysis of the relationship between the afatinib concentrations and time-matched QTcF changes from baseline revealed a statistically significant negative slope and a predicted negative QTcF change from baseline (90% CI -2.83, 2.55 ms).  No relevant effect of afatinib on other cardiac intervals was detected. The overall AE profile was consistent with the known safety profile of afatinib. The median tmax value for afatinib was approximately 3 h after a single dose (Day 1) and at steady state (Day 14). The gMean accumulation ratio was 2.05 based on Cmax values and 2.67 based on AUC values. Efficacy was assessed in 60 pts including NSCLC (35%), breast cancer (10%), GBM (7%) & GI tumors (32%). Two pts had brain metastases. 42% of the pts received > 4 treatment cycles, 18% > 6 cycles, and one pt 19 cycles.  Conclusions', '  Afatinib at doses of 50 mg daily did not suggest any drug-induced QT/QTcF prolonging effects compared with baseline. Afatinib showed clinical efficacy in this patient population.']",

This trial assessed safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KTN3379 alone or with each of four targeted agents in advanced cancers and evaluated potential biomarkers of KTN3379 activity.  Methods', '  Part I evaluated KTN3379 in a single agent dose escalation design. Part II evaluated KTN3379 with each of cetuximab, erlotinib, vemurafenib and trastuzumab in patients with refractory SCCHN, CRC, NSCLC, melanoma and HER2+ breast cancer (n = 6 each). Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were evaluated in the first treatment cycle, RECIST tumor measurements every 3rd treatment cycle and PK and blood pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments each treatment cycle. Archival tumor tissue was evaluated for biomarkers and correlated with KTN3379 activity.  Results', '  In Part I, no DLTs were observed in the 16 patients treated with KTN3379 at doses of 5 up to its maximally administered dose of 20 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks. PK parameters were linear, supported every 3-week dosing, and trough blood levels following dosing of KTN3379 at 10-20 mg/kg were consistent with maximum antitumor activity in preclinical models. Grade 3 or higher treatment related AE was reported in 1 patient (diarrhea). Other treatment related AEs were low grade diarrhea (n = 5), mucositis (n = 3), rash (n = 3), anemia (n = 2), and fatigue (n = 2). Patients in Part II to date had a similar profile, with low grade diarrhea, mucositis and rash being the most common AEs. In both Parts, elevations of soluble ErbB3 were noted after treatment. Other blood biomarkers and NRG expression are being evaluated. The best tumor response to date has been stable disease.  Conclusions', '  Doses of 10-20 mg/kg exceed target blood concentrations. KTN3379 doses of 20 mg/kg with other targeted agents are safe and PK supports 3-week dosing. KTN3379 has the potential to benefit patients in combination with other targeted agents against ErbB family members, and NRG may be a predictive biomarker of response to KTN3379 in future studies.
