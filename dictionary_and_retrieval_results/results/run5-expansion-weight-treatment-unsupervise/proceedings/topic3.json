        "Background":"['Background', '  Determination of the BRAF mutation status is a requirement for treatment selection of metastatic melanoma patients. However, the inter and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity for BRAF status has been described supporting the need for testing multiple sites for the same patient. Circulating DNA is considered a promising non-invasive tool for cancer monitoring. The objective of our work was to determine the potential of plasma DNA to detect BRAF mutations, particularly in patients presenting discordant BRAF status from different tumor sites.  Methods', '  Plasma DNA was extracted using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification system (Invitrogen). BRAF mutations were detected using the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen).  Results', '  Ninety-nine patients were included, and plasma was collected at baseline. Nine stage III melanoma patients presenting a mutant BRAF (6 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600D) were tested and for 4 of them we detected the corresponding mutation (including the V600D and both V600K) in circulating DNA (sensitivity 44.4 %). Similarly, 20 stage IV patients were tested (17 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600R). The corresponding mutation (including the V600R and both V600K) was detected in 15 of these patients (sensitivity 75.0%). Interestingly, 4 stage IV patients included in our series presented discordant BRAF mutation status on different sites (1 patient with a WT primary tumor (PT) and a V600E lymph node (LN) metastasis; 1 patient with a V600E PT and WT LN metastasis; 2 patients with a V600E PT, V600E LN and WT liver metastasis). We were able to detect the expected BRAF mutation in circulating DNA for all these patients.  Conclusions', '  The sensitivity of our procedure, based on approved kits, suggests a high interest for use in clinical practice, even for non-V600E mutations. Plasma DNA might be less sensitive to heterogeneity between tumor samples, and therefore might represent an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations in clinical setting.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in 40-60% of melanomas with the majority of mutations resulting in V600E/K. Previous cohort studies have identified rates of non-V600E/K BRAF mutations to occur in 5-12% of patients. Despite this, there remains limited evidence characterizing the disease characteristics and outcomes of patients who harbor the non-classical BRAF mutation. Methods', ' Retrospective review of all melanoma patients treated at a tertiary cancer center that had BRAF mutation testing through targeted sequencing. Three groups of patients were identified and compared with respect to patient and disease characteristics', ' a) BRAF negative; b) BRAF V600E/K positive; c) BRAF non-V600E/K positive. Results', ' BRAF testing was performed in 168 melanoma patients of which 101 (60%) were BRAF negative; 55 (33%) were BRAF V600E/K positive; 12 (7%) were BRAF non-V600E/K positive (2 G466E, 1 of each G469E, K601N, K601E, L597Q, L597S, V741I, N594G, D594N, V600R and 1 with both K601N & V600E). Of these, 147 patients had baseline demographic and treatment data available for analysis. BRAF mutations were more common among males (45.6% of men vs. 22.7% of women, p = 0.03). No significant differences between other baseline patient demographics noted. Pathological characteristics revealed a non-significant trend toward poorer prognostic factors with BRAF non-V600E/K patients having increased Breslow depth (7.0 mm vs. 5.0 mm BRAF negative, 4.3 mm BRAF V600E/K) and higher rates of ulceration (71% vs. 44% BRAF negative, 30% BRAF V600E/K). BRAF non-V600E/K patients displayed a non-significant trend toward poorer overall survival (71 months vs. 215 months BRAF negative, 125 months BRAF V600E/K). Conclusions', ' Non-V600E/K BRAF positive patients appear to display less favorable disease characteristics and outcomes as compared to BRAF negative and BRAF V600E/K positive patients. Non-V600E/K melanoma show limited response to BRAF targeted therapy; however, evidence suggests the presence of non-classical mutations may confer susceptibility to MEK inhibition. Further characterization of non-V600E/K BRAF melanoma may allow for more refined prognostication and treatment decisions.']",

        "Background":"['IntroductionActivating mutations in the BRAF gene are common in skin and colorectal tumors. In more than 90% of the cases, these mutations are located in the BRAF V600 codon (V600E and V600K). Targeted therapies like vemurafenib and dabrafenib have shown objective response rates in up to half of metastatic melanomas harboring these BRAF V600 mutations. Tumor mutation status is usually assessed starting from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue shavings. Typically, the test involves shipment of the paraffin block from the local pathology lab to a specialized molecular lab, where several steps need to be performed.MethodsThe Biocartis molecular diagnostics (MDx) prototype platform is a novel, random access, sample-in result-out automated qPCR system. It uses a disposable cartridge which can simultaneously detect and quantify up to 30 molecular markers from a wide range of solid and liquid sample types, including blood, feces, and sputum. For FFPE-based assays, a single curl or shaving is directly placed into the cartridge. The complete process time for sample preparation, PCR and reporting is less than 90 min, with <2 minutes hands-on time. We hereby present a concordance study of the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay (which detects BRAF V600E, V600K, V600R, V600E2, V600D and V600M) with the Roche cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test (Cobas). Sixty-four FFPE samples from melanoma and other tumors, with varying amounts of melanin, % tumor, and % BRAF V600 mutated tumor cells were randomly selected and tested. Both the Biocartis MDx prototype platform and the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay were used for research use only purposes. Deep sequencing was performed using MiSeq (Illumina) with over 5,000-fold coverage and sensitivity of 1% of minority species for each sample.ResultsOne sample was not eligible for Cobas testing because of low tumor content. Three other samples failed on both platforms. For the remaining 60 samples, results on the Biocartis MDx platform and Cobas were concordant in 58 (96.7%) samples (44 BRAF V600 WT and 14 BRAF V600 mutant samples, of which 36 samples were randomly selected and confirmed by deep sequencing). In 2 (3.3%) samples, no BRAF V600 mutation was detected by Cobas, while a BRAF V600 mutation was detected by both the Biocartis MDx platform and by deep sequencing. Both were melanoma samples (one of which was highly pigmented), excised in 1993 and 2005, and contained 4.6% V600E and 5.6% V600K (as determined by deep sequencing), respectively.ConclusionsThe new MDx platform is a fast and reliable method for BRAF V600 mutation testing directly on FFPE tumor shavings with superior analytical sensitivity, ease of use, and turnaround time compared to existing diagnostic tests. The BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay provided excellent concordance with both Cobas (96.7%) and deep sequencing (100%).']",
