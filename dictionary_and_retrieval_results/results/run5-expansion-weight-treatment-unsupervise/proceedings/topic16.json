        "Background":"[\"Gene rearrangements involving NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and ALK result in oncogenic fusion proteins that have been identified in many types of cancer, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, papillary thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma and other histologies. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available, highly potent and selective ATP-competitive pan-Trk, ROS1 and ALK inhibitor. In preclinical studies, entrectinib effectively inhibits target kinase activity and cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth across various fusion partners and cancer types. More importantly, entrectinib's activity has been validated clinically in patients across multiple fusion partners and tissue histologies.Trk inhibitors, including entrectinib, have shown promising clinical activity in molecularly selected patients. Predictably, potential resistance mechanisms have also begun to emerge. For example, mutations in the Trk kinase domain were identified as one of the in vitro induced resistance mechanisms to the Trk inhibitor, Loxo-101. The three reported resistance mutations in the Ba/F3-MPRIP-NTRK1 cell line model treated with Loxo-101 were F589, G667 and V573. The F589 location on TrkA is equivalent to the gatekeeper mutations, L1196 location on ALK and L2026 location on ROS1. These gatekeeper mutations often arise as resistance mechanisms in patients treated with ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. To test the activity of entrectinib against these three reported NTRK1 mutations, we introduced mutated Trk proteins into Ba/F3 and cancer cell lines and performed dose-dependent proliferation studies. Entrectinib was able to inhibit proliferation of cells harboring each of these three mutations that confer resistance to other Trk inhibitors. Particularly, the IC50 values of entrectinib against kinase domain wildtype and gatekeeper mutated (F589) are essentially unchanged (low single-digit nM), which is consistent with the observation that entrectinib is also able to inhibit the gatekeeper mutation in ALK (L1196) in both cell based assays and in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that entrectinib is an effective treatment for patients with NTRK-rearranged tumors, including cancers that harbor certain resistance mutations to other Trk inhibitors.\"]",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases. A number of recurrent leukemogenic gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and clinically validated in AML. However, nearly 50% of AML patient samples lack any known AML driver mutations. Advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of novel and actionable gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements in these AML samples. The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene is one such rearrangement identified in samples from patients with AML. Fusion of ETV6 sequences to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 results in constitutive activation of the TRKC kinase and ETV6-NTRK3 expression has emerged as one of the key oncodrivers for leukemogenesis. Constitutive activation of TRK family tyrosine kinases has also been detected in a wide range solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, highly potent and selective kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency against TRKA/B/C, ROS1 and ALK kinase activities (encoded by NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively). In these studies, we have demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib in AML cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and survival in vitro with sub-nanomolar EC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein as well as phosphorylation of known TRKC downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Sensitivity to entrectinib was dependent on expression of the TRKC fusion protein. In xenograft models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression, which was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. The clinical relevance of activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements has been validated by the efficacy of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with NTRK rearranged acute myeloid leukemias and provide rationale for the clinical development of entrectinib in molecularly defined hematologic malignancies. Entrectinib is currently the subject of an ongoing global Phase 2 basket study enrolling patients across multiple tumor histologies containing TRK, ROS1 or ALK fusions.']",

        "Meeting_name":" c-Met inhibition blocks MEK-induced tumor cell invasion in uveal melanoma",
        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults. About half of patients with uveal melanoma will develop metastatic disease to the liver and the lung. These tumors are characterized by mutations in G-proteins (GNAQ and GNA11), activation of MAPK, and over-expression of c-Met. We have previously reported that c-Met inhibition inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis formation in uveal melanoma. Altiratinib is a selective inhibitor for c-Met as well as TIE2, VEGFR2 and TRK kinases. We found that this agent had no effect on inhibiting cell growth, consistent with our previous findings with crizotinib. However, it did inhibit invasion of uveal melanoma cells through matrigel in a concentration dependent fashion (25 nM to 250 nM) with inhibition of phospho-Met noted at concentrations as low as 25 nM. Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is currently in clinical trial in patients with this disease. We found that treatment with 250 nM selumetinib inhibited cell proliferation but unexpectedly induced a marked increase in cell invasion of GNAQ and GNA11 mutant cell lines. This was associated with an increase in c-Met RNA and protein expression, as well as receptor phosphorylation, after 24 hours of selumetinib treatment. Combining selumetinib with altiratinib inhibited cell invasion to the level of altiratinib alone and continued to inhibit cell proliferation to the level of selumetinib alone. This effect was recapitulated by the knockdown of c-Met by siRNA prior to treatment with selumetinib. In a uveal melanoma xenograft model, the combination treatment of 15 mg/kg altiratinib and 25 mg/kg selumetinib significantly delayed tumor growth compared to vehicle control, altiratinib and selumetinib alone. Western blot analysis of tumor tissue confirmed target inhibition of p-Met and p-ERK in animals treated with altiratinib and selumetinib, respectively. Furthermore, tumor metastasis was inhibited by altiratinib, selumetinib and combination treatments in a uveal melanoma mouse model. These results indicate that the combined inhibition of MEK and c-Met by selumetinib and altiratinib, respectively, may be sufficient to suppress uveal melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. This strategy can potentially be used as therapy for patients with primary uveal melanoma who are at high risk for the development of metastatic disease.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are known for high MYC expression. MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine analogue and a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor. 131I-MIBG has been used for scintigraphic detection of neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma and melanoma) that specifically uptake MIBG by norepinephrine transporters (NET). 131I-MIBG is also used for targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Non-radiolabeled MIBG had been reported to be cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of its growth suppressive effect was not elucidated. Our previous studies showed that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. In this study we confirmed that MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma cell lines (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5, Nb69, and SKNAS), and its growth suppressive effect in each cell line correlated with NET expression in these cells. In addition, MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma stem cells derived from SKNBE(2)C. MIBG treatment of SKNBE(2)C and SKNAS resulted in an increase expression of growth suppressive gene (GADD45B) and genes encoding for biomarkers of favorable neuroblastoma (CD44, EPHB6, EFNB2, EFNB3, NTRK1). Treatment of MYCN amplified (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5) and non-MYCN amplified (Nb69, SKNAS) neuroblastoma cells with MIBG resulted in marked reduction of MYCN and MYC expression, respectively in dose and time dependent fashions. Collectively, our studies suggest that MIBG not only targets neural crest derived tumors, but also is a MYCN/MYC destabilizing agent.']",

It is highly expressed in high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell NEC (LCNEC), but is not expressed in normal tissue. DLL3 is expressed in melanoma, glioblastoma (GBM), neuroendocrine prostate, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), and other solid cancers. Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting DLL3, composed of a DLL3-specific IgG1 monoclonal antibody joined to a toxic DNA cross-linking agent by a cleavable linker. Rova-T binds to DLL3 on target-expressing cells, is internalized and cleaved, releasing the toxin to induce cell death. A Phase 1 study of Rova-T in SCLC showed encouraging antitumor activity in DLL3-high patients (pts), and was well-tolerated (Rudin et al., Lancet Oncol, 2016). As novel therapies are needed for multiple cancers that express DLL3, Rova-T may be effective in these tumors.
