        "Meeting_name":" The long non-coding RNA CAI2 is a tumor suppressor gene",
        "Background":"['We have recently reported on the discovery of a long non-coding RNA imbedded in intron 2 of the p16/ARF (CDKN2A) locus at 9p21. CAI2 is a non-conserved, RNA pol II regulated gene with whose expression is highly correlated with parent genes p16 and ARF. However, CAI2 is expressed in cell lines deleted for p16, ARF and even p15, and is expressed cell lines epigenetically silenced for p16 and/or ARF. Furthermore, treatment of p16 and/or ARF epigenetically silenced cell lines with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidin allows p16 and/or ARF re-expression while having no influence on CAI2, confirming independent regulation. Speculating, therefore, that the regulatory region of CAI2 lies imbedded in the non-transcribed portion of intron 2, we created expression constructs of the immediate 5 region of CAI2. However, consistent with a bioinformatical analysis, no regulatory activity was detected. This suggests that this non-coding RNA is non-traditionally controlled by remote but yet to be identified regulatory element(s) and/or mechanisms. By colony formation assay, CAI2 overexpression can inhibit cell growth in the p16 intact HEK293T and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines. RNA Immunoprecipitation has revealed that CAI2 interacts with H3K27me3, a recruiter of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that modulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and BMI1, a PRC1 complex protein that is a negative regulator of p16. Consistent with this effect, CAI2 can induce p16 expression in HEK293T cells, and this was hypothesized to be the mechanism by which CAI2 inhibits cell growth. However, we now show that CAI2 can also inhibit colony formation in the p16/ARF deleted MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly however, CAI2 overexpression had little to no effect on 2D cultures of HEK293T or MCF7 cells including DNA synthesis, XTT metabolic activity or cell count.As CAI2 is imbedded in the p16/ARF gene, standard siRNAs may inadvertently influence p16 and/or ARF expression due to actions on their pre-mRNAs. Therefore, we created a series of partial CAI2 knockouts using CRISPR technology and compared their growth by colony formation assay. Notably, clones containing a partial knockout of the 5 region of CAI2 proliferated faster than mock transfected clones, consistent with the growth suppressive properties observed with CAI2 overexpression. In 2D cultures, a small increase in DNA synthesis was also observed in the partial deletions. The HEK293T clones containing partial deletions of CAI2 also exhibited small increases in expression of the remaining intact portions of the gene with a concomitant decrease in p16 expression, all consistent with an influence of CAI2 on p16 expression and cell growth; no influence on ARF expression was observed.Taken together, the data demonstrate that CAI2 is capable of influencing p16 expression, but this influence is insufficient to fully account for the ability of CAI2 to regulate growth, and we conclude that CAI2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene in its own right.']",

        "Background":"['Obesity, a disease linked to increased number of adipocytes in various tissues, is now recognized as a risk factor for the development of breast cancer. Importantly, obesity has been reported to be associated with the occurrence of larger, more advanced tumors and aggressive cancer pathological features, including lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage, and high grade. Cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs), the most abundant cellular component of breast cancer-associated stroma, promote carcinogenesis through paracrine effects. However, the molecular basis of adipocytes implication in breast carcinogenesis remains elusive. To shed light on this important phenomenon, we established and characterized normal adipocytes from post-plastic surgery of breast tissues. We have shown that these cells express various adipocyte biomarkers, including Leptin, TNF- and FABP4. Furthermore, we investigated the role of the tumor suppressor p16 INK4A protein in adipocytes activation. We have found that specific down-regulation of p16INK4A by shRNA increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines including leptin, activated breast adipocyte and enhanced their migration/invasion abilities. Consequently, media conditioned with these cells stimulated the proliferation and the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells and enhanced endothelial cell differentiation into capillary-like structures. In addition, we have also shown that media conditioned with breast cancer cells decrease the expression of p16INK4A and increase the expression of leptin in adipocytes.These results provide the first indication that p16INK4A down-regulation in breast stromal adipocytes is an important step toward their activation.']",

        "Background":"['In addition to serving crucial roles in bone development, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling contributes to the development and progression of many cancers, making it an attractive candidate for treatment of bone-resident cancers. Recent data suggest that Hh-targeted agents exert pluripotent effects on host bone microenvironment cells through both cell-intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms, interrupting the vicious cycle of tumor cell, osteoblast (OB), osteoclast (OC), and bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) interactions in bone metastatic breast cancers. Here, reciprocal stimulation between tumor cells and bone cells enhance both tumor growth and bone pathology. Similarly, development of osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone cancer, is strongly influenced by conditions within surrounding microenvironment providing additional points for therapeutic intervention.The 5-year survival rate for metastatic OS is under 30%, highlighting the need for novel and targeted treatments. We have demonstrated that mice deficient in the tumor suppressor ARF (p19ARF; p14ARF in humans) have enhanced rates of bone turnover, mimicking the adolescent growth period in which OS is prevalent. By crossing Arf-/- mice with those expressing Tax, an HTLV-1 oncogene that results in osteolytic tumors, we developed a model of high penetrant spontaneous OS that recapitulates many aspects of human disease. Here, suppression of bone turnover with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid prevented the development of OS, suggesting that enhanced OC activity may stimulate OS growth. In agreement, we found that Tax+Arf-/- OS had increased RANKL-to-OPG ratios resulting in increased osteoclastogenic ability. Compared to normal osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cell precursors, Tax+Arf-/- OS cells have increased expression of Hh pathway genes and exhibit increased susceptibility to Hh inhibitors (SMO antagonists). In particular, Tax+Arf-/- OS cells express high levels of the Hh ligands Sonic (SHH) and Indian (IHH), suggesting they may stimulate surrounding cells in a paracrine fashion. Notably, BMSC derived from non-tumor bearing Tax+Arf-/- mice also exhibit increased expression of pro-tumorigenic factors (including IL-6 and IGF), generating a fertile soil. SHH or conditioned media from Tax+Arf-/- OS cells enhanced OC activity and BMSC cell production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors. Furthermore, the increased OB and OC differentiation and activity present in Tax+Arf-/- cells could be abrogated with SMO inhibitors. We have established an OS cell line from Tax+Arf-/- mice (TAN) with the ability to form mineralized tumors upon intratibial injection. Using this model, we hypothesize that treatment with SMO antagonists will decrease OS growth due to both tumor cytotoxic effects and direct effects on host bone microenvironment cells that abrogate the pro-tumor microenvironment.']",

We investigated several key genetic alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins in advanced breast cancer patient samples to identify potential targets for cell cycle related treatment options.  Methods', '    A comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on 37 breast cancer samples with the majority being metastatic. Testing included targeted exome sequencing of 562 genes in tumor and paired normal DNA.  Results', '    Patients ages ranged from 27-66 years. Analysis of cell cycle regulatory genes revealed focal amplification of cyclin D1/D2 or CDKN2A loss in 9/37 (24%) of  cases, of which, 45% were hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 negative,  33%  were HR positive, HER2 positive and 22% were triple negative (TNBC) subtype. Loss of RB1 was analyzed since it negatively regulates response to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Loss of RB1 was noted in 4/37 (10.8%) of cases, all of which were TNBCs. Only a single TNBC with RB1 loss had concurrent CDK4 amplification and loss of CDKN2A. No evidence of CCNE1 amplification was found in any samples. Incidence of CDK4 and CDK6 amplification was found in samples with cyclin D1 amplification or CDKN2A loss. Our cohort included a single male TNBC patient who harbored cyclin D1 amplification as well as CDKN2A loss. Overall, amplification of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, CDK4 and CDK6 was found in 16%, 5.4%, 2.7% and 2.7% respectively. Loss of CDKN2A was noted in 5.4% of tumors profiled.  Conclusions', '    Exome sequencing identified subsets of patients with mutated cell cycle associated genes that may benefit from CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Our data suggests loss of RB1 is more frequent in TNBC subtype which may confer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our analysis suggests that in addition to HR positive, HER2 negative patients, a subset of HR positive, HER2 positive patients could be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors due to activation of the cell cycle pathway as evidenced by mutations in key genes.']",

In healthy humans, p16INK4a expression increases markedly in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with chronologic age and exposure to mutagens such as tobacco. The expression of p16INK4a increases exponentially with age, with an average 10-fold increase between ages 20 and 80 years old (Liu et al, Aging Cell, 2010).  To determine the effects of BC therapy on a molecular marker of aging, we measured T-cell expression of p16INK4a in older women undergoing therapy for early stage BC.  Methods', ' Pts 65 yrs with Stage I-III BC had p16INK4a expression measured in peripheral blood T-cells isolated by magnetic bead sorting on the same day as phlebotomy. Expression of p16INK4a was determined at least 3 months after the completion of BC therapy by TaqMan qRT-PCR.  Expression of p16INK4a was measured in replicate and normalized to a housekeeping control gene (18S ribosomal RNA).  Expression analysis was determined by investigators blinded to clinical data.  Results', ' 73 of 200 planned patients have had T-cell expression of p16INK4a assessed. Mean/median age range (years) for all pts was 73/71 and (65-93).

        "Background":"['Breast cancer remains a significant public health issue in the industrialized countries. Physicians depend on surgery, cytotoxic adjuvant chemotherapy, or radiation for treatment of breast cancer patients. Few novel therapies are approved for clinical use. Although existing therapies are effective in controling the disease in many patients, the cytotoxic side-effects make them limited. This is especially the case in the patients with early stage breast cancer whose prognosis with surgery alone is good and avoiding adjuvant chemotherapy would spare them toxic side effects. On the other hand, significant fraction of patients relapses and develops metastasis. Therefore, it is critical to identify markers for better breast cancer patient stratification based on their prognosis that would guide physicians in selection and aggressiveness of therapies. Recently, we linked transcription factor DMP1 (cyclin D binding protein 1, Dmtf1) as a critical tumor suppressor that blocks proliferative signals from ErbB2 and oncogenic Ras by activating p14Arf-p53 pathway. hDMP1 is hemizygously deleted in 50% of human breast tumors that retain wild-type ARF and p53. In this study we identified an upstream kinase, MEKK1, which cooperates with Dmp1 to activate Arf transcription. In constitutively active form (C-terminal kinase domain or CA-MEKK1), MEKK1 increased transcriptional activity of Dmp1 via direct phosphorylation, while the full length (regulatory and kinase domain) form behaved as a feedback inhibitor by increasing Dmp1 ubiquitination. Phosphorylation sites on DMP1 that increase its transcriptional activity were mapped to the C-terminal transactivation domain. Expression of CA-MEKK1 in breast cancer cell lines activated endogenous Arf-p53 pathway. hMEKK1 is located on human 5q11 chromosome, a locus frequently deleted in breast and lung cancer. Since MEKK1 appeared to be an activator of p53 tumor suppressor pathway, we wondered if MEKK1 is involved in human cancer. Using DNA from breast cancer patient tumors and matched normal tissue, we analyzed hMEKK1 gene deletion using specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) primers. MEKK1 was found hemizygously deleted in 20% of patients. Immunohistochemistry confirmed reduction of MEKK1 protein intensity to LOH(+) compared to LOH (-) patients. In the independent cohort of breast cancer patients, we show that low MEKK1 mRNA expression is associated with adverse outcome. Here we show that constitutively active MEKK1 is a novel activator of Dmp1-Arf-p53 pathway via Dmp1 phosphorylation. The MEKK1 gene was frequently deleted in breast tumor tissue and its expression was correlated with disease outcome. Overall, MEKK1 is a potential prognostic/predictive indicator for breast cancer and could be used by physicians to better stratify patients.']",

We have shown that adipocytes from obese women express low level of the tumor suppressor p16 protein, have higher secretion of various adipokines and higher invasion and migration capabilities as compared to adipocytes from lean women.

When targeting SHRs for BC therapy, the major challenge is how to increase the selectivity of drugs against SHRs in specific cell/tissue. While estrogen- and progesterone- receptors are well studied in BC, glucocorticoid (GC) as a ubiquitous stress activated steroid hormone is less investigated. However, the elevated GC circadian dynamics is associated with poor prognosis, and GC receptor (GR) is highly expressed in metastatic BC. GCs are used successfully as an adjuvant therapy to induce apoptosis of leukemia and lymphoma. However, when applied to BC, the results are controversial with most GCs showing either pro-survival or no effects. To analyze the underlying mechanisms, gene expression profiling was performed in this study using qRT-PCR array that covers the genes as the drivers of BC. Our results showed that compared to MCF7 (luminal subtype) cells, MDA-MB-231(basal B subtype) cells are more responsive to Dexamethasone (Dex; a synthetic GC) treatment with the higher number of genes that were either up- or down-regulated. Shared by both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the Dex-regulated genes are highly related to cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), followed by the genes involved in signal transduction, cell division and apoptosis, including SERPIN-E1, CDKN2A, c-Myc, THBS1, Snai2 and E-cadherin. However, the up- and down-regulation patterns are different between MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells. Using a real-time label-free cell assay, we identified that Dex promotes MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion and migration but only the spreading for MCF7 cells, suggesting that there are cell-specific effects of GC/GR in different subtypes of breast cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Recent health surveys have revealed that green tea is one of the most commonly consumed natural products among breast cancer survivors. Although breast cancer survival has increased during the past two decades due to adjuvant endocrine therapy with antiestrogens (AE) such as Tamoxifen (TAM) and Faslodex (FAS) the risk of acquired endocrine-resistance still persists for many women. This can be mimicked by a prolonged culture of breast cancer cells with sequentially increasing concentrations of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4OHT; 1 nM -1 M), applying a selection pressure for cells to acquire resistance to 4OHT. Such cells maintain their resistant phenotype even after removal of the pressure (Brunner et al., 1993). The aim of this study was to determine whether a green tea polyphenol (EGCG) can affect the development of TAM-resistance in breast cancer. We tested the efficacy of EGCG, in this long-term [LT] cell culture model. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells (n=2/group) were cultured in media containing', \" i) Vehicle (0.01% EtOH;, LT-V); ii) LT-4OHT (1 nM to 1 M; increasing every 3rd passage; LT-4OHT); or iii) 4OHT (1 nM to 1 M) + EGCG (100 nM;single dose;LT-EGCG). Growth rate was recorded for each passage (P), measured as the time required reach confluence (70%), after which the cells were subcultured. We will present results of this LT study including mechanisms by which EGCG may alter resistance-development, focusing on signaling pathways such as ER, NFkB and unfolded protein response (UPR) known to be involved in endocrine resistance. During the initial passages (P1-P6; [4OHT]  5 nM) the cells grew at the same rate regardless of the treatment. Starting at P8, time to confluence was delayed for LT-4OHT ([10 nM]; 7d) compared to the LT-V. This delay was even more pronounced at P15 ([100 nM];  21d), suggesting that cells were under a growth inhibition/selection pressure. The growth rate of LT-EGCG did not differ from LT-4OHT prior to P15, but in subsequent passages a delay was evident (14 to 18 d). To test whether the cells maintained their (delayed growth) phenotype, they were first cultured in regular media for 24h and tested for growth inhibition by 4OHT (1 nM-1M) and FAS (100 nM). LT-V cells (P27) were more susceptible to the inhibitory effects of 1 M 4OHT (73  11% versus 0 M 4OHT) than LT-4OHT cells (P19; 105  40%), confirming the development of resistance in LT-4OHT cells. In contrast, LT-EGCG cells had retained their sensitivity to 4OHT, similar to LT-V (P19; 75  8%). All treatment groups were equally responsive to FAS (30%). These results suggest that EGCG may delay the development of a 4OHT-resistance in breast cancer cells. It will be confirmed whether the effect prevails after removal of selection pressure (4OHT). This data will provide a better understanding of green tea's potential to prevent TAM-resistance in breast cancer patients.\"]",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumorigenesis induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) shows a greater clinical response to radiation therapy when compared to HPV negative patients. The underlying mechanism for this more favorable outcome is unknown, but the presumption is that DNA repair response must play a large role. P16INK4a is a known surrogate marker for HPV positivity; however the relationship between radiation sensitivity and P16INK4a has not been completely elucidated in this context. Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitylating enzyme that cleaves ubiquitin from substrates to stabilize target proteins. USP7 overexpression is a predictor of poor prognosis in lung carcinomas and correlates with disease progression and lower survival in gliomas. More recent studies have shown USP7 has a role in the stability of DNA damage response proteins such as RNF168, BRCA1 and Chk1; and USP7 knockdown has been shown to radio-sensitize breast cancer cells to radiation. We have investigated the possible role of USP7 in the radio-response of HNSCC cells in the context of HPV status.Methods', ' Four HPV(+) and four HPV(-) HNSCC were chosen for this study. The radio-response was determined by clonogenic survival assay. P16INK4a overexpression was generated using lentivirus. Western blot analysis was used for visualizing protein expression. The Cancer Genome Atlas was interrogated to examine the relationship between USP7 and clinical outcome.Results', ' Our data suggest P16INK4a negatively regulates USP7 and leads to the more radiosensitive phenotype associated with HPV(+)HNSCC. Radio-resistant HPV(-) HNSCC cell lines show higher levels of USP7 than HPV(+) lines and over-expression of P16INK4a in HPV(-) HN5 cells leads to down-regulation of USP7 and radio-sensitization. Conversely, P16INK4a siRNA knockdown in HPV(+) UMSCC-47 shows an increase of USP7 protein expression and radio-resistance. P22077, an inhibitor of USP7 activity, was also shown to radiosensitize a HPV(-) cell line. This shows proof of principle that inhibiting USP7 can be a viable approach to sensitizing HPV(-) HNSCC to radiation.

        "Background":"['Cell migration and invasion play essential roles in the metastatic cascade of tumor cells. Accumulated evidences suggest that intratumoral hypoxia, a characteristic of fast-growing solid tumors, promotes cancer cell motile and invasive abilities. In this study, we investigated the effects and interaction of hypoxia, surrounding fibroblasts, and p16 expression on the migration and invasion of breast cancer (BCa) cells MDA-MB-231, JygMC(A) and LM2. We found that hypoxia promoted BCa cell migration and invasion, and cocultured MEF fibroblasts stimulated invasiveness of BCa cells. Moreover, by using a Tet-on inducible system, we found that p16 is capable of inhibiting hypoxia-induced BCa cell migration and invasion (e.g., 36.0% and 85.8% inhibition on migration and invasion, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 cells), and suppressing cocultured fibroblast-stimulated invasiveness of BCa cells. These results suggest that p16, in addition to its well-known anti-tumor proliferation function, has novel anti-cancer properties capable of suppressing hypoxia-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion.

        "Background":"['Approximately 60-70% of invasive breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor and are termed hormone receptor positive (ER+). Endocrine therapy remains the therapeutic backbone for the treatment of ER+ cancers and although anti-estrogen therapies are initially frequently effective, 50% of ER+ patients develop resistance to hormonal manipulation within their lifetime, ultimately leading to therapeutic failure. Two emerging mechanisms of endocrine resistance include activation of growth signaling pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and more recently, the decoupling of cell cycle control from ER-signaling, via deregulation of the cyclinD-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK-4/6', 'INK4', 'Rb) pathway. In this study we hypothesized that combining an anti-estrogen (letrozole or fulvestrant) with a CDK-4/6 inhibitor (LEE011) and PI3K inhibitors (buparlisib [BKM120; pan-PI3K inhibitor] or BYL719 [-specific PI3K inhibitor] would elicit an improved tumor response over agents inhibiting either pathway alone.Four ER+ BC mouse models including, an ER+ patient primary human letrozole sensitive model (HBX34, PTEN/PIK3CA wild-type) and three ER+ cell lines; ZR75-1 (PTEN null), MCF7 (PIK3CA mutant) and KPL1 (PTEN/PIK3CA wild-type) were used for this study. Treatment was carried out daily at doses relevant to clinical exposures for a period of 4 weeks with fulvestrant combinations and 8 weeks with letrozole combinations followed by observation for tumor progression. Treatment doses were as follows', ' LEE011 (75 mg/kg), BKM120 (30mg/kg), BYL719 (35mg/kg), Letrozole (2.5mg), Fulvestrant (5mg/wk) either as single agents or in combinations (Hormone therapy (HT)+LEE011, HT+PI3Ki, HT+LEE011+PI3Ki).Significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was observed for single agent treatment with the CDK-4/6 inhibitor in each of the four ER+ xenograft models. The addition of letrozole (HBX34) or fulvestrant (MCF7, ZR751 and KPL1) with LEE011 increased the TGI observed with single agent. The triplet combination with each PI3K inhibitor increased the (TGI) even further, inducing tumor regressions in each of the four models. Response was independent of PI3K/PTEN mutation status. Complete tumor regressions were observed for a subset of mice within each of the triple combination arms. Tumor regressions were maintained for up to four weeks post-interruption of treatment. No significant toxicities were observed with any of the triplet combinations.These preclinical data highlight the potential efficacy and safety of targeting the ER, CDK-4/6 and PI3K signaling pathways in ER+ breast cancer. LEE011 in combination with an anti-estrogen is sufficient to inhibit tumor growth in vivo, while the addition of a PI3K inhibitor results in robust tumor regressions. The combination of LEE011 with an anti-estrogen and a PI3K inhibitor is a rational therapeutic approach that should be investigated in the clinic.']",

Cophenetic, dispersion, and silhouette metrics revealed 4 clusters, with significant enrichment of differentially expressed (DE) genes in each subgroup among both sets (all comparisons Fisher Exact p < 2.2E-16). A parsimonious gene centroid signature of 480 total genes was selected based on Goeman's Global Test BH-adjusted p-values and fold change of only the Discovery Set. Subgroups were assigned by Pearson Correlation in the Discovery (Rand Index = 0.97) and Validation Sets (RI = 0.84), as well as an External Set made up of 214 IHC-confirmed cases of TNBCs, and another 5 publicly available studies with clinical outcome data for TNBCs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was carried out separately on DE genes from each dataset (BH adjusted p < 0.01). There was overwhelming statistical agreement for all subgroups between the Discovery, Validation, and External Sets. Subgroup 1 was defined by Intermediate Grade LumB tumors and overexpression of ESR1, HER-2, and AR, with activated downstream signaling of ESR1 despite being ER- by IHC. In subgroup 2, CDKN2A and TP53 appeared activated while MYC was inhibited. Dozens of immune cell signaling pathways were downregulated in the third subgroup, a basal-like set of TNBCs, which was driven by inhibition of cytokine gamma-IFN. Disease-free and Overall Survival was the worst for subgroup 3 (log rank p = 0.041 and 0.039). The final subgroup (4) was found to be p53 inactivated, a known feature of TNBC but specific to this second basal-like subgroup.

The activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) by intratumoral hypoxia stimulates a group of downstream genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that are responsible for tumor malignant progression. Loss of p16 expression occurs in many cancers including breast cancer. Our studies showed that, by ectopic expression via adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, p16 downregulates VEGF gene expression by neutralizing the transactivation of HIF-1, and suppresses breast cancer angiogenesis and metastasis. To investigate whether p16 directly affects one or more aspects of the metastatic cascade, MDA-MB-231 cells infected with lentivirus expressing Tet-on inducible p16 were used to study the p16 effects on growth, adhesion and migration of the breast cancer cells. We found that p16 inhibits MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation (45.6% inhibition) and hypoxia-induced cell migration (36% inhibition), but has no apparent effect on cell adhesion. The p16-mediated inhibition of hypoxia-induced cell migration parallels with p16s inhibition of HIF-1 transactivation activity. These results indicate that p16s ability to suppress breast tumor metastasis may result from a combined p16-mediated actions including inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. This study suggests that p16 gene therapy may have clinical potentials to treat breast cancer due to p16s multiple-level anti-cancer capabilities', ' inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, blocking tumor angiogenesis, inhibiting cell migration and suppressing metastasis.']",

Various targeted therapies are being clinically and preclinically tested for BC management. MIBC have been associated with loss of cell cycle control. Defects in the RB pathway are a major mechanisms of cell cycle deregulation in MIBC. RB1 mutations were reported in 13% of TCGA samples, although significant mutations also were noted in CDKN1A, CDKN2A, and CCND3. The CDK 4/6 complex combines with cyclin D1 to inhibit RB activity. Therapeutic targeting of this complex improves outcome in ER positive advanced breast cancer. Methods', ' Palbociclib (PD-0332991) is a cdk4/6 inhibitor currently tested for the treatment of other malignancies characterized by the presence of a functional RB1 gene. A series of BC cell lines of known genomic characteristics and differing in their RB1 status, were tested for their sensitivity to Palbociclib. Results', ' unexpectedly, we observed a similar response to Palbociclib in pRb wt and pRb mutant cell lines in vitro and in xenografts in vivo, although with different biochemical and cell cycle effects. Genomic characterization of these treated cells shows strong gene expression divergence as a consequence of Palbociclib treatment in pRb wt and mutant cells. Nonetheless, bioinformatic analyses revealed FoxM1 as a possible common regulator of some downregulated genes in both cases. Importantly, FoxM1 has been demonstrated a bona fide cdk4 substrate and may confer cis-platinum resistance. We observed reduced FoxM1 phosphorylation upon Palbociclib treatment in all cell lines tested, and also increased sensitivity to cis-platinum. Remarkably, we found that phosphorylated FoxM1 is a potential poor prognosis factor in human BC clinical samples. Conclusions', ' in our study we observed that the activity of Palbociclib in BC cell lines is independent on the RB1 status and showed synergistic activity with cisplatin.

Multiplex panel testing may be an efficient way of evaluating MP patients for the presence of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes. However the spectrum of mutations in many cancer susceptibility genes in the MP patient population is largely unknown. We performed massively parallel sequencing using targeted capture of 15 genes with well-established risks of breast and/or other cancers, specifically TP53, CDH1, PTEN, STK11, ATM, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, RAD50, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MUTYH. Our patient cohort consisted of 221 BRCA1/2 negative patients diagnosed with breast cancer and at least one other primary cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients diagnosed with contralateral breast cancer were included. Thirty patients (14%) were found to have at least one deleterious variant in these 15 genes. Deleterious variants were found in CHEK2 (16 patients, 7.2%), TP53 (4, 1.8%), MSH6 (3, 1.4%), ATM (2, 0.9%) and one patient each had deleterious variants in CDKN2A, PTEN, PMS2, PALB2, BRIP1 and NBN. In addition, six patients (2.7%) were found to be heterozygous carriers of a MUTYH mutation. In comparison, deleterious variants were identified in 9% of 341 patients with breast cancer only, indicating a small but nonsignificant increase in the rate of deleterious variants in MP patients. The rate of MUTYH heterozygous mutations was also non-significantly different in patients with breast cancer only (1.2%). There was a significant increase in the rate of CHEK2 and MSH6 mutations in the MP versus breast-only patients (7.2% vs 3.5%, p = 0.04 for CHEK2 and 1.4% vs 0%, p = 0.05 for MSH6). As a corollary study, a subset of MP patients (n = 165) were assayed on a panel including TET2. Deleterious TET2 mutations were identified in 2 of 165 patients (1.2%) at allele frequencies of 0.17 and 0.36. These patients blood samples were ascertained at ages 77 and 72, respectively. These preliminary data show that in our cohort of patients with multiple primary cancers, over 16% of patients were found to have deleterious variants in 15 cancer susceptibility genes. In addition, approximately 1% of MP patients have deleterious variants in TET2 that may be due to age-related clonal hematopoiesis, although it is unknown if these mutations are related to the development of the tumors in these individuals.

Clusters I and II express high HER2 (ERBB2) and estrogen receptor beta signaling signature, sharing features with Luminal A breast cancer. Cluster III shows similarities to Basal-like breast and squamous cell head and neck carcinomas..

        "Background":"['Targeting cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) with inhibitors such as abemaciclib has shown promise in early and late phase clinical trials in both breast cancer and NSCLC. While there is evidence that patients benefit from single-agent abemaciclib, combination strategies leveraging this compound together with immunotherapy are of interest for the treatment of these and other cancers. Consequently, it is important to understand if and how a cell cycle inhibitor can be combined with immunotherapy. However, because most preclinical studies have been performed using xenograft tumors in immune-compromised mice, the potential immunomodulatory effects of abemaciclib have not been adequately ascertained. To investigate the immune combinatorial potential of abemaciclib, we studied the effects of treatment alone and in combination with checkpoint immunotherapy in a murine syngeneic tumor model sensitive to abemaciclib using immuno-competent mice. Abemaciclib monotherapy of established murine CT26 tumors, which harbor KRAS G12C mutation and CDKN2A deletion, caused a dose-dependent delay in tumor growth. Surprisingly, gene expression analysis showed that treatment was associated with an increase in intra-tumor immune inflammation without major alteration in immune subset frequencies. Testing of various dosing regimens in this preclinical model found that monotherapy abemaciclib pretreatment followed by combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy, induced an enhanced anti-tumor response compared to abemaciclib and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies. Optimal combination therapy exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy, resulting in complete tumor regression (CR) in 50-60% of mice in a setting where anti-PD-L1 monotherapy showed little or no efficacy (0% CRs). Mice which maintained CRs after cessation of combination therapy were able to resist later CT26 rechallenge, demonstrating that abemaciclib in combination with anti-PD-L1 enabled the generation of an immunologic memory. Examination of intra-tumor gene expression during treatment found that combination therapy further amplified the immune/T cell activation signature compared to both monotherapies. Intra-tumoral suppression of cell cycle genes, which are indicative of inhibition of CDK4/6, was also greater during the combination therapy, suggesting that the effects anti-PD-L1 therapy may augment the cell cycle arrest induced by abemaciclib. Although it was uncertain if agents that inhibit cell proliferation could be combined with immunotherapy, these preclinical results demonstrate that it is possible to combine CDK4/6 inhibition by abemaciclib with checkpoint immunotherapy to improve tumor efficacy. The synergistic responses observed in terms of tumor efficacy, immune activation, and cell cycle control provides support for the clinical investigation of this combination.']",

GG and CG rats continued also consuming GEN, and all rats in GC and 20 rats in CC groups stated consuming GEN one week after the TAM treatment started. 15 CC rats were never fed GEN.Mammary tumor latency was longer in GG (p<0.003) and GC rats (p<0.095), compared to CC rats. The response of tumors to TAM treatment was classified as complete or partial response, or de novo resistant. Prepubertal and life-time GEN intake increased, and intake starting during TAM treatment reduced response to TAM (p<0.001). Mammary cancer recurrence rate was highest in the rats which started consuming GEN during TAM treatment, and significantly lower in life-time, prepubertal and adulthood only GEN intake groups (p<0.001). Brca1 mRNA level was highest in the mammary gland of life-time GEN consuming rats (p<0.05). Tumor suppressor genes p21WAF1/CIP1 and p16INK4a mRNA levels were significantly higher in both prepubertal GEN groups (GC and GG) than in CC rats (p<0.05), as was the expression of pro-apoptotic gene Bax (p<0.05). No changes in estrogen receptor (ER) protein expression in the mammary gland were seen among the groups, but progesterone receptor (p<0.05) and phosphorylated HER2/ErbB2 (p<0.05) were both expressed at a lower level in rats consuming GEN through the life-time, compared with rats which consumed GEN during adult life (CG rats).Our findings show that rats exposed prepubertally or through the life-time to GEN were at lower risk of developing TAM resistance than rats which started GEN intake in adulthood or post-diagnosis. The effect of prepubertal GEN exposure in increasing TAM responsiveness may be related to up-regulation of tumor suppressor genes Brca1, p16INK4a and p21WAF1/CIP1 in their mammary gland. Recurrence rate was highest in those rats that were consuming GEN for the first time during TAM treatment. If true for humans, women with ER+ breast cancer should not start consuming GEN during TAM treatment.']",

        "Background":"['BackgroundOver the past years, tumor derived alterations in plasma has emerged as a promising cancer biomarker. The clinical applications envisioned with liquid biopsies range from monitoring of treatment response to disease progression and acquired resistance. However, the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is challenging owing to the small fraction of tumor specific DNA relative to background levels of non-tumor derived DNA and therefore requires highly specific and sensitive techniques.Experimental proceduresThe Ion AmpliSeqTM Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, covering 2,800 COSMIC mutations from 50 cancer genes was used to analyze 31 primary tumor and metastatic lesions along with 19 matched plasma samples from 13 breast cancer (BC) patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment and 6 advanced stage metastatic BC patients. Digital PCR (dPCR) experiments were set up using mutation-specific assays (Biorad) for the detection of 13 hotspot mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, AKT1, CDKN2A and STK11 genes previously identified in the solid tumor samples using next generation sequencing (NGS).ResultsThe specificity and sensitivity of the mutation-specific dPCR assays were tested in dilution curves using synthetic oligonucleotides and tumor samples bearing the mutation of interest. Mutations could be robustly detected in plasma samples using dPCR with a sensitivity as low as 0.1% and a sensitivity of 0.5% using NGS. All mutations previously identified using NGS were validated using dPCR in tumor (n = 27) as well as in plasma samples (n = 5). Moreover, dPCR identified 4 additional mutations in 4 plasma samples in the neoadjuvant setting and 4 in the metastatic setting, 2 in tumor and 2 in plasma samples. The mutant allelic frequencies (MAF) of these newly identified mutations were very low (range 0.2%-1.8%) close to the detection limit of the technology. Through the use of dPCR, the detection rate of plasma ctDNA increased from 8% using NGS to 38% in the neoadjuvant setting and from 67% using NGS to 100% in the metastatic setting thereby highlighting the greater sensitivity of the dPCR technology. The MAF assessed by NGS and dPCR were highly correlated both in the neoadjuvant and metastatic (Spearman  = 0.84 and  = 0.97) settings, a higher concordance between NGS and dPCR being observed when the MAF are high.ConclusionsThe use of dPCR allows the detection of low-frequency tumor-specific mutations in plasma with a greater sensitivity compared to NGS providing the high accuracy and sensitivity essential for liquid biopsies.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Caffeine normalizes breast stromal fibroblasts and suppresses their pro-carcinogenic effects.",
        "Background":"['Breast cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and second-leading cause of death in women worldwide. Breast stromal fibroblasts, the most abundant and the most reactive cells of the tumor stroma, actively promote tumor growth, invasion, migration, angiogenesis and metastasis through elevated secretion of several factors including SDF1, MMP-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). These secretions are under the control of several tumor suppressor genes such as p16, p53 and CAV-1, which were fond to be down-regulated in most active fibroblasts. Therefore, our major aim in this study was to study the potential use of caffeine to up-regulate these tumor suppressor genes and hence reduces the secretion of these cancer-promoting factors. We have shown that low doses of caffeine up-regulate the tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, p53 and CAV-1 in breast stromal fibroblasts. Consequently, the expression and secretion of MMP-2 and VEGF-A was reduced following caffeine treatment. Moreover, caffeine reduced the expression of SDF-1, TGF- and -SMA, three important markers of active fibroblast, suggesting that caffeine has the ability of normalizing stromal fibroblasts. To further confirm this, we have shown that caffeine suppresses stromal fibroblast-related enhancement of invasion/migration of breast cancer cells. Importantly, this effect was mediated through caffeine-dependent inactivation of the two major invasion/migration protein kinases Akt and Erk, through up-regulating PTEN in breast stromal fibroblasts. Furthermore, caffeine suppressed the expression/secretion of VEGF-A in breast stromal fibroblasts and their paracrine enhancement of angiogenesis in vitro. This effect was mediated through inhibition of the VEGF-A activator HIF-1. Therefore, we have clearly shown here that caffeine, a natural and pharmacologically safe product, has the potential to normalize breast stromal fibroblasts and consequently suppresses their paracrine procarcinogenic effects.']",

        "Background":"['Epidemiological studies have highlighted the ability of micronutrients in plants to reduce the risk of breast cancer. Phytochemicals can interfere with cell-signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. -Tocotrienol is a natural form of vitamin E that displays a potent and selective anticancer activity against various mammary cell lines with no discernible toxicity toward normal cells. Sesamin is an abundant phytochemical in sesame seed oil which showed antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity against human breast cancer cells. In addition, sesamin inhibits the metabolism of vitamin E isomers and increases their bioavailability and efficacy. Preliminary growth inhibition studies showed that combined treatment with subeffective doses of -tocotrienol and sesamin synergistically inhibited the growth of neoplastic murine +SA (ErbB2-positive) and human MCF-7 (luminal A, ER-positive) mammary epithelial cells, as determined by MTT assay and isobologram analysis. Additional studies were conducted to determine the intracellular mechanisms mediating the synergistic anticancer activity in +SA mammary epithelial cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that combined treatment of -tocotrienol and sesamin increased the percentage of cells in G1 phase as compared to the vehicle-treated control group. Western blot studies revealed that blockade in cell cycle progression is associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, phospho-Rb, and E2F1 transcription factor, and corresponding increase in levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins, p27 and p16. Additional Western blot experiments showed that the combined -tocotrienol and sesamin treatment caused a marked decrease of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors phosphorylation. Furthermore, the combined low dose -tocotrienol and sesamin treatment was associated with a relatively large decrease in the intracellular levels of total or phosphorylated c-Raf, Mek1/2, Erk1/2, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, p-NF-B, Jak1, Jak2, and Stat1 as compared to all other treatment groups. Additional studies were conducted to investigate whether the growth inhibitory effects of the combined treatment is associated with a concomitant activation of apoptotic pathways. Results showed that the combined -tocotrienol and sesamin treatment did not activate early or late apoptosis events in the cell indicating that the inhibitory effects of the combined treatment are cytostatic, but not cytotoxic. In summary, these findings indicate that sesamin synergistically increases the anticancer effects of -tocotrienol, and combined treatment with these agents may provide some benefits in the treatment of breast cancer in women.

Curcumin, obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has potent anticancer activity. So far none of the study demonstrates the inhibition of PhIP induced cytotoxicity by the co-treatment of Curcumin in normal breast epithelial cells in vitro. Therefore, we developed a model system using the MCF 10A normal breast epithelial cells to study the PhIP cytotoxicity and if cells are co-cultured with Curcumin and PhIP how it affects. Consequently, the core signaling pathways have been explored to evaluate the efficacy of Curcumin. In this study, the effectiveness of Curcumin was investigated in MCF 10A cells along with PhIP. The cytotoxic ability was detected with MTT assay, ROS activation by DCF, the influence of the cell cycle was checked with flow cytometry, DNA damage by comet assay, DNA adduct formation by anti-PhIP DNA primary, and apoptosis by Annexin-V-FITC staining. The influence of the core signaling pathways was evaluated by RT PCR and/or Western blotting which included Nrf2 (GSR, GPX, NQO1), FOXO (Catalase, GADD45, PRDX3) targets; DNA repair genes/proteins BRCA1, H2AFX and PARP-1; and tumor suppressor P16 gene expression. PhIP cytotoxicity induced the expression of various antioxidant and DNA repair genes on MCF-10A cells but co-treatment of Curcumin retained its expression level similar to untreated groups. Additionally, Curcumin co- treatment increased the expression level of tumor suppressor expression gene P-53. Expression of antioxidants genes was induced by PhIP whereas Curcumin significantly suppress the PhIP induced ROS activation, DNA strand breaks and DNA adduct formation and consequently inhibited the cell death.
