        "Background":"['Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers, and the 5-year survival rate is less than 10% due to lack of effective therapeutic agents. This study was to evaluate antitumor activity of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE, a recently developed bispecific enediyne-energized fusion protein, on esophageal carcinoma, targeting both EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), because both EGFR and HER2 have been shown overexpression in over 30% of esophageal cancers. The fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was encoded by a gene that was genetically constructed by fusing the oligopeptides ligand Ec (22 amino acids of EGF COOH-terminal) and Hr (VH CDR3 region of anti-HER2 C6.5 antibody) with lidamycin (LDM, an enediyne antibiotic with potent cytotoxicity) via two (G4S)3-linker. The encoded 18.4 kDa fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized its binding affinity with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells by flow-cytometry-based immunofluorescence assay. The results showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE protein bound to ESCC cells EC9706 and KYSE150 with high affinity (the Kd values were 5.283mol/L and 3.562mol/L, respectively). The potency of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was determined on four human ESCC cell lines with differential expression of EGFR and HER2 using MTT assay. The bispecific Ec-LDP-Hr-AE showed potent cytotoxicity to EC1, EC109, EC9706 and KYSE150 cells with IC50 values in the picomolar level. Moreover, the bispecific Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was more potent than the monospecific counterparts (Ec-LDP-AE and LDP-Hr-AE) and LDM. Cell cycle distribution assay revealed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE caused G2-M arrest in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells, in which the G2-M phase cells reached the peak with 0.1nmol/L of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE treatment. Ec-LDP-Hr-AE also induced cancer cell apoptosis in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells and the induction of apoptosis was in a dosage-dependent manner. The apoptotic index in the EC9706 cells exposed to 0.1, 0.5, or 1 nmol/L of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE were 15.0  0.3%, 38.1  0.6%, and 50.0  0.4%, respectively. Western blotting showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE promoted caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities as well as PARP cleavage, indicating that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondria-caspase cascade. Moreover, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited KYSE150 cancer cell proliferation via decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and further exerted inhibition of the activation of their downstream signaling molecules (e.g. AKT and ERK). In summary, the bispecific energized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE exhibited potent cytotoxicity to ESCC cells in vitro, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via targeting EGFR and HER2. These results suggest that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE could be a promising candidate for esophageal cancer targeting therapy.']",

Using a sensitive sequencing assay, we compared the genomic profiles of ESCC and EAC focused on the ability to identify potential targets for therapy in the 2 diseases.   Methods', '    DNA was extracted from 40u of FFPE sections from 71 clinically advanced ESCC and 231 EAC. Next generation sequencing based comprehensive genomic profiling (NGS) was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a median coverage depth of > 650x for 236 cancer-related genes. The results were evaluated for all classes of genomic alterations (GA). Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGA) were defined as GA linked to drugs on the market or under evaluation in mechanism driven clinical trials.  Results', '  There were no significant differences in the age range for ESCC and EAC (median', ' 63 vs. 60 years). All ESCC and EAC were at an advanced stage (Stage III/IV) at the time of sequencing. GA per sample on average in 71 ESCC and 231 EAC were 7.4 and 5.6 respectively. The frequency of CRGA in ESCC (2.6/sample; 94.4% of cases) and EAC (2.7/sample; 93.1% of cases) were similar. CRGA more frequently identified in ESCC than EAC included PIK3CA (24% vs 10%), PTEN (11% vs 4%), CCND1 (42% vs 13%) and NOTCH1 (17% vs 3%). CRGA more frequently altered in EAC than ESCC included KRAS (23% vs 6%) and ERBB2 (23% vs 3%). Other GA that were significantly different in the 2 tumor types included SMAD4 (1% ESCC vs 14% EAC), SOX2 (18% ESCC vs 1% EAC) and NFE2L2 (24% ESCC vs 1% EAC). EGFR was altered in 8% of ESCC and 15% of EAC. Clinical case examples of patient responses to targeted therapy will be presented.   Conclusions', '    ESCC and EAC share common high frequencies of overall and clinically relevant GA. However, PI3K/mTOR (PIK3CA and PTEN) and Notch pathway genes were significantly enriched in ESCC, and RAS/MEK pathway genes (ERBB2 and KRAS) were significantly enriched in EAC. Comprehensive genomic profiling shows significant promise to identify CRGA in both ESCC and EAC and lead to potential use of clinical outcome altering targeted therapies in both major types of esophageal cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its family members HER2, HER3 and HER4 are found in a variety of human malignancies and their roles in cancer development and progression has been widely recognized for long time. Molecular drugs targeting EGFR family, such as small-molecule inhibitors and specific monoclonal antibodies, are now under intensive investigation in clinical setting. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), EGFR and HER2 are frequently overexpressed and their poor prognostic impacts have been reported to date. However, there is no study evaluating gene amplification of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 simultaneously in ESCC in a large cohort. We examined gene amplification of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 using realtime PCR-based copy number assay on 196 surgical specimens of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Gene amplification of EGFR and HER2 (copy number > 4) was observed in 7 % and 11%, respectively. Although the copy numbers were relatively low, we found gene amplification of HER3 and HER4 to be observed in 8% and 7%, respectively. Gene amplification at least one or more genes was observed in 23 % (45/196) of ESCC samples. Overlapping gene amplification was identified in 8 % (15/196) of samples. In relation with clinical characteristics, gene amplification of HER2 and HER4 was significantly involved in shorter relapse-free survivals in stage III ESCC. In conclusion, gene amplification of EGFR family was frequently observed in ESCC and PCR-based copy number assay could be a powerful tool for detecting gene amplification using FFPE samples. Our results strongly encourage the development of EGFR family-targeted therapy for ESCC with gene amplification.']",

Sym004 is a novel anti-EGFR antibody mixture that consists of two recombinant IgG1 antibodies against domain III of the EGFR. The primary mechanism of action of Sym004 is thought to be EGFR cross-linking, internalization and degradation of the EGFR from the cell surface. EGFR is highly expressed in the overwhelming majority of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We, therefore, investigated the effect of Sym004 in human ESCC cell lines in the present study.Method', ' In this preclinical study, approximately 50 ESCC cell lines and 3 kinds of anti-EGFR antibodies (Sym004, cetuximab, and panitumumab) were used. According to protein expression status and gene mutation status analyzed by Western blotting and next generation sequencing, these ESCC cell lines were classified into several groups. High EGFR-expressing cell lines were used for further investigations. Internalization of anti-EGFR antibodies into ESCC cells and inhibition of the EGFR signaling cascade by anti-EGFR antibodies were studied in in vitro experiments. Growth inhibitions by anti-EGFR antibody treatment were investigated in in vitro and in vivo experiments. The present preclinical studies were conducted at the National Cancer Center East Japan as collaborative studies with Merck Serono.Result', ' Even though protein expression of EGFR was detected in all ESCC cell lines, a variety of the expression levels were seen among the cell lines consistent with the previous data of clinical specimens.

In a growth inhibition assay, more potent anti-proliferative activity of Sym004 was observed than those of other anti-EGFR antibodies in some cell lines. No obvious correlation between EGFR expression and the anti-proliferative activity was observed, although cell lines with higher EGFR expression showed a trend toward higher sensitivity to Sym004. In vivo xenograft studies of Sym004 using human ESCC cell lines are currently underway and will be presented in the annual meeting.Conclusions', ' These studies showed that Sym004 exhibited antitumor activity in some ESCC cell lines in preclinical settings, and are expected to provide a scientific rationale along with a possible clinical indication of ESCC in clinical setting.']",

        "Meeting_name":" The BK5.erbB2 mouse as a novel model of esophageal adenocarcinoma",
        "Background":"[\"The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rising rapidly throughout the Western world, and is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE). BE is intestinal metaplasia of squamous esophageal epithelium, important clinically due to the fact that it increases an individual's chance of progression to EAC 30 to 125-fold higher than people without BE. Despite its clinical importance, the molecular pathogenesis of BE is poorly understood. One limitation in the study of BE pathogenesis has been the lack of suitable experimental models. There is a critical need to develop good preclinical models of BE. ErbB2 was reported to be amplified and overexpressed in BE, EAC, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the role of erbB2 in the development and progression of esophageal cancer is still unknown. In this study, we utilized BK5.erbB2 mice, in which erbB2 is overexpressed in epithelial cells under the control of the bovine keratin 5 promoter to determine whether the interaction between erbB2 and bile acids is important in the etiology of esophageal cancers. BK5.erbB2 mice (2 months of age, n=8) and age matched wild type mice (n=10) were treated with porcine bile extract (10mg/mouse in 200L water), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) (0.1mol/mouse in 200L water), or water control, 3 times weekly for 14 weeks by gavage. In the BK5.erbB2 mice, exophytic tumors in the forestomach, which has the same histological structure of esophagus, were observed in 20%, 33%, and 0% of mice treated with bile extract, TCDC, and water control, respectively. No tumors were observed in wild type mice. All tumors observed in BK5.erbB2 mice were diagnosed as SCC. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the bile acid treatment increased the levels of p-EGFR, p-MAPK, and p-Akt in the forestomachs of the BK5.erbB2 mice. Furthermore, CDX2 (a marker of BE) was significantly expressed in BK5.erbB2 mice treated with bile extract or TCDC. No development of intestinal metaplasia in forestomach was found. We further investigated using a surgically manipulated reflux model. Eleven 7 week-old BK5.erbB2 and 5 wild type mice were given an esophagogastroduodenostomy. Mice were sacrificed at post-operative week 8, and examined histologically. Hyperkeratosis and intestinal metaplasia were observed at the anastomosis sites in both BK5.erbB2 and wild type mice. These histological changes were more prominent in BK5.erbB2 mice. Interestingly, dysplastic lesions were observed only in BK5.erbB2 mice. These results indicate that more persistent exposure of bile via surgery induce the development of not only SCC, but also precancerous lesions of adenocarcinoma in the esophagus/forestomach of BK5.erbB2 mice. The interaction between erbB2 and bile acids is important in esophageal tumor formation and intestinal metaplasia. A surgical model using BK5.erbB2 mice could possibly be a promising model for the study of the development of EAC.\"]",

        "Background":"['Human esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. More than 90% of esophageal cancer is esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). While the etiological causes remain unclear, esophageal mucosal fungal infection is very common in esophageal cancer patients, including patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) who have more than 20-fold risk of ESCC when compared to the healthy population. Here, we report that kinase-dead Ikka knock-in mice (hereafter referred to as mutant mice) develop APECED-like autoimmune disease due to developmental defects in thymus and lack of central tolerance. Similar to human APECED patients who develop esophageal mucosal fungal infection on average at the age of five, mutant mice develop fungal infection in oral cavity and esophagus as early as seven weeks old. About 20% of mutant mice develop ESCC during aging, which exhibits specific molecular signatures observed in human ESCC, such as p16 gene silencing, elevated EGFR phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression, etc. Autoreactive T cell depletion, or central tolerance reconstitution and/or normal T cell transfer prevents fungal infection and ESCC development in mutant mice. Importantly, antifungal drug treatment inhibits inflammation and ESCC development in mutant mice. However, oral inoculation of Clasdosporium, one of the major fungal species isolated from mutant mice, increases the tumor incidence from 20% to 63% in mutant mice.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histologic subtype of esophageal cancer, particularly in Asia. Currently, no targeted therapy has been approved for treating this type of disease. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy remains to be the standard care for first line treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer with limited efficacy. Activation of EGFR/HER3/PI3K pathway is frequently observed in esophageal cancer, however, their therapeutic value remains to be further tested.Methods', ' In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of LJM716, a fully human anti-HER3 antibody, either alone or in combination with anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab or PI3K alpha subunit inhibitor BYL719 in esophageal squamous cancer. LJM716, cetuximab and BYL719 single agent as well as their pair-wised combination activity were assessed in 24 esophageal squamous cancer cell (ESCC) lines using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Single agent and combination anti-tumor activities of these reagents were also tested in selected cell line xenograft and patient derived xenograft mouse models.Results', ' NRG1 expression (60%), PIK3CA mutation (8%), moderate PIK3CA (30%) and EGFR (30%) amplification were detected in a panel of 24 ESCC lines. Anti-HER3 antibody LJM716 potently inhibited HER3 phosphorylation and decreased pAKT level in these cell lines. In vitro, LJM716 inhibited proliferation of a sub-set of ESCC lines. LJM716 further enhanced and broadened the anti-tumor activities of both BYL719 and cetuximab in ESCC lines. In mouse xenograft models, LJM716 single agent treatment induced tumor stasis while combination with either BYL719 or cetuximab induced model dependent tumor regression.Conclusion', ' NRG1-HER3-PI3K pathway activation is commonly observed in esophageal squamous cell cancer. Activation of HER3 is a potential mechanism leading to resistance to EGFR or PI3K targeted therapies, and combining anti-HER3 therapies with therapies targeting PI3K/EGFR may provide new therapeutic strategy for patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer.']",

        "Background":"['The 5-year survival rate of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains dismal despite improvements in treatments such as surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation, and current clinical staging approaches are limited in their ability to effectively stratify patients for treatment options. To improve the clinical risk assessment for ESCC patients, we developed an immunohistochemistry-based predictor model by evaluating the prognostic value of a three-gene signature, i.e. epidermal growth factor receptor, phosphorylated Specificity protein 1, and Fascin, which constitute a regulatory axis in ESCC cells as revealed by our previously study. The presence of this three-gene signature and the association with clinical outcomes were analyzed in 185 esophageal curative resection specimens (generation dataset), and the findings were validated using an independent cohort of 130 specimens (validation dataset). We revealed that the protein expression of this three-gene signature was highly predictive of ESCC survival in both generation and validation datasets (P=0.001). Regression analysis showed that this three-gene signature was an independently predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio=1.990 [95% CI, 1.256-3.154], P=0.003 in generation dataset; hazard ratio=2.358 [95% CI, 1.391-3.996], P=0.001 in validation dataset). Importantly, the predictive ability of the 3-gene signature was more robust than that of each individual factor.

According to Chinese cancer registry annual report in 2012, esophagus cancer accounts for nearly 1 in 10 of all cancer deaths. Despite the fact that much progress has been made in diagnosis and systemic chemotherapy regimens, the overall prognosis of esophagus cancer is disappointing. The 5-year survival rate, all stages included, is around 1525%. There remains a significant unmet medical need for esophagus cancer treatment.EGFR expression was reported in 3090% esophagus cancers and overexpression of EGFR was found to be associated with poorer survival. Unlike colon cancer, K-ras mutation was less frequently found in esophagus cancer (510%), suggesting EGFR pathway blockade might bring therapeutic benefit to those patients with EGFR activation or overexpression. In this study, as of November 2013, 35 surgical esophagus tumor samples were collected from a local hospital in Shanghai. 31 of the 35 samples were identified as squamous cell carcinoma. EGFR gene amplification, protein expression and K-ras mutation were studied. In addition, 9 patient derived esophagus cancer xenograft models (PDX) were developed and anti-tumor effect of a novel and highly potent EGFR inhibitor was evaluated in 6 PDX models.Positive EGFR protein expression was found in 66% (23/35) of esophageal cancer samples. EGFR gene amplifications were observed in 9% patients (3/35). In 9 established PDX models, 7 of them showed EGFR expression and 2 with EGFR gene amplification. No K-ras mutation was observed in the 9 models. A novel and highly potent EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi), developed by Hutchison and currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials in China, demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in several PDX models with tumor growth inhibition in a range of 70% to >100%. One PDX model with EGFR gene amplification and overexpression exhibited the highest sensitivity to EGFRi with remarkable tumor regression. EGFR signaling transduction was evaluated and the EGFRi inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK.In conclusion, EGFR expression and/or gene amplification was frequently found in Chinese esophagus cancer. EGFR inhibition resulted in potent anti-tumor effect in multiple patient derived esophagus cancer models carrying EGFR amplifications or high expression, suggesting the potential benefit that anti-EGFR agents might bring to esophagus cancer patients with abnormal EGFR activation.']",

EGFR, HER2, MET, and PI3K amplifications were tested using fluorescent in situ hybridization in patients who underwent esophagectomy for distal esophagus and EGJ adenocarcinoma from 2009 to 2013. Disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with TP53, KRAS, PI3K, BRAF, APC mutant and wild-type tumors using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models. The impact of HER2 expression and outcomes were also analyzed.RESULTS', 'Of 54 distal esophagus and EGJ adenocarcinoma patients, 5 different driver mutations were observed in 39 patients, including TP53 (11/39, 28.2%), KRAS (6/39,15.4%), PI3K (2/11,5.1%), BRAF(1/39, 2.6%) and APC (2/39,5.1%).

        "Background":"['BackgroundEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) represents the most common form of esophageal cancer worldwide, especially in East Asia, where alcohol drinking and smoking have been implicated in the field carcinogenesis of ESCC. However, the oncogenic process therein has been poorly understood in terms of gene mutations.Patients & MethodsA total of 100 samples, including cancer, dysplastic, and non-dysplastic esophageal tissues, were obtained from 24 individual with (N = 14) or without (N = 10) ESCC (a median of 2.5 samples per case', ' 129) either by endoscopy or surgery and were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). An additional paired cancer/non-caner samples from 32 patients was analyzed by targeted sequencing (TS). All samples were analyzed for copy number alterations (CNAs) using SNP array- and/or digital sequencing-based karyotyping.ResultsIn WES, clonal evolution in esophageal epithelia, as determined by the presence of somatic mutations, was detected in 21 of 21 cancer, 12 of 12 dysplastic, and 63 of 67 non-dysplastic samples, where the mean number of mutation per sample showed a significant trend to increase in cancer (65) and dysplastic samples (50) compared to non-dysplastic samples (13) (P = 2.110-11). CNAs, especially those involving CDKN2A, CCND1, YAP1, and EGFR, were frequently affected in cancer samples, but rarely so in non-dysplastic samples. Non-dysplastic samples tended to have smaller allelic burden and therefore, clone size, compared to dysplastic and cancer samples (P = 2.210-16). Mutations had a predominant age-related signature in non-dysplastic samples but increasing APOBEC3A/3B patterns was observed in cancer and dysplastic samples. Shared mutations were found only within cancer tissues but never among dysplastic or non-dysplastic samples, suggesting the latter lesions are clonally independent from each other. In accordance with previous reports, TP53 mutations were found in 21/21 cancer samples and also found in dysplastic (11/12) and non-dysplastic samples at a lower frequency (26/67). Strikingly, non-dysplastic samples harbored a very high frequency of NOTCH1 mutations (51/67), which were also found in cancer (3/21) and non-dysplastic (8/12) samples but at much lower frequencies (P = 6.610-7). TS of validation samples confirmed the trend of higher NOTCH1 (84% vs. 25%) and lower TP53 mutation rates (38% vs. 100%) in non-dysplastic samples compared to cancer samples. The number of mutations in non-dysplastic samples was higher in drinkers than non-drinkers. Multiple NOTCH1 mutations were more common in cancer patients and drinkers than non-drinkers.ConclusionClonal proliferation in non-cancer esophageal epithelia is common even in non-ESCC cases and extensive in ESCC cases. NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations play major roles in clonal evolution in common but may have differential impacts on esophageal carcinogenesis, which is likely to be shaped by APOBEC-induced mutations and CNAs.']",

The major collection of GenenDesign PDX tumor model platform represents cancer types that are prevalent in Asian patients, including gastric cancer (> 200 models), esophageal cancer (>100 models), liver cancer (50 models), pancreatic cancer (>60 models) and lung cancer (> 80 models). Establishment of variant PDX models from the same patient tumor is on-going to support translational studies of tumor heterogeneity.Initial characterization indicates that the mouse PDX models have captured the major histopathological characteristics of the original human tumors. Reproducible growth curves for PDX models (>P3) support their usage in efficacy analysis of anti-cancer therapeutic agents. Response curves to SoC (standard of care) chemotherapies such as Paclitaxel for lung cancer, FOLFOX for gastric cancer and Sorafenib for liver cancer have been established in the PDX tumor models, providing a baseline for further investigation of novel therapies in a combination setting.On-going molecular characterization including oncogene mutational analysis and target specific IHC and FISH analysis has identified panels of PDX tumor models with aberrations in key oncogenic signaling pathways, including lung panels with EGFR overexpression or KRAS mutations, gastric panels with FGFR2 amplification or being HER2 positive, lung and gastric panels with cMET overexpression. Testing of Herceptin in the gastric HER2 positive tumor panel resulted in observations similar to that from the ToGA trial.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Overexpression of Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) in cancer was associated with poor outcome and high chances of recurrence before the development of anti-HER2 agents. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2 based on its antibody component trastuzumab. After internalization of T-DM1/HER2, Lys-MCC-DM1, a tubulin binding agent is released in the cytoplasm. In spite of therapeutic advances, acquired resistance to treatment remains a major obstacle. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to T-DM1 is necessary to improve treatment regimens for HER2-overexpressing cancer patients. We have developed and characterized resistance models to T-DM1 in order to describe underlying resistance mechanisms and develop alternative strategies.Methods', ' To develop in vitro T-DM1 resistance models, HER2-overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE-19 was exposed to increasing doses of T-DM1 several months in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A (CsA, an inhibitor of MDR1 transporter). Resistance models were called OE-19 TR (exposed to T-DM1) and OE-19 TCR (exposed to T-DM1 and CsA). To characterize the resistance models, sensitivity to T-DM1 was assessed by MTT assay, Annexin V-PI staining and xCELLigence. Cell cycle distribution was assessed by propidium iodide using flow cytometry. Cross-resistance was studied by MTT assay. Expression of HER2, ABC transporters and tubulin was studied by rt-qPCR, flow cytometry and/or Western Blot. An expression profile of sensitive and resistant cells to T-DM1 was performed using a pan-genomic Illumina cDNA array.Results', ' After prolonged exposure of OE-19 cells to T-DM1, IC50 value is 18-fold higher in TR cells and 21-fold higher in TCR cells and both models become less sensitive to T-DM1-induced apoptosis. T-DM1 induced G2/M arrest in OE-19 sensitive cells but not in resistant cells. We found that resistant cells become less sensitive to trastuzumab but remain sensitive to other HER2-targeted therapies such as lapatinib, as well as to a variety of chemotherapy agents. Among the resistant cells, a subpopulation with increased expression MDR1 was identified in OE-19 TR and TCR. Concerning the expression of the main targets of T-DM1 (HER2 and tubulin); we found that HER2 expression and total  and  tubulin expression and content remained unchanged. However the isoforms 2 and 3 were overexpressed in both resistant models. A transcriptomic approach of T-DM1 resistant cells showed modification in adhesion junctions and focal adhesions.Conclusion', ' Prolonged exposure of the OE-19 cell line to T-DM1 resulted in resistance to this immunoconjugate. We are working on describing the resistance mechanisms to T-DM1, which are important to understand cancer progression in patients receiving this therapy. In the long term, we hope this study will allow proposing agents that benefit T-DM1-refractory cancer patients.']",

        "Background":"['The detection of tumor specific genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has largely centered on point mutations. The identification of tumor-derived structural changes including rearrangements and amplifications has been more challenging. Approaches that analyze allelic imbalance are often not sufficiently specific to accurately define such events for solid tumor malignancies that shed low levels of DNA. Since some of the most robust clinical responses to targeted therapies have been those directed at gene products from amplified loci, we developed a method to detect such changes in a highly specific manner.One of the most attractive therapeutic targets in oncology is currently the MET/HGF pathway, which is activated as a result of gene amplification of the MET tyrosine kinase receptor. This pathway can be activated de novo or as a mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibition in a variety of cancers. We have developed an assay, termed METDetect, to capture and sequence the genomic regions corresponding to the MET gene, including coding and non-coding loci as well as control regions. Sequencing of these regions resulted an average of 33Gb of sequence data at a coverage of 3,125-fold per analyzed base. Validation analyses showed that amplification associated rearrangements resulting from focal amplification of the MET gene were readily detected to a level of 0.25% mutant DNA molecules while these were not present in tumors or ctDNA without such alterations.We applied METDetect to 205 plasma samples from patients with gastric, lung and esophageal cancer. MET amplification was also evaluated through either FISH or next-generation sequence approaches, and ranged from 2.2-fold to 30-fold in the tissue of patients with MET amplification. A concordance of >90% was achieved when MET amplification in plasma DNA was compared to MET amplification status in matched tumor tissue. We detected between 1 and 86 rearrangements associated with MET amplification in the plasma and calculated the global MET copy number to be 1.0-10.0 fold (average 2.2-fold) for each amplified case. Finally, no MET amplification associated rearrangements or amplified copy number results were noted in plasma samples from 19 patients whose tumors did not harbor MET amplification. METDetect is a noninvasive, ctDNA-based assay with high precision and accuracy for the detection of MET amplification in patients with cancer.']",
