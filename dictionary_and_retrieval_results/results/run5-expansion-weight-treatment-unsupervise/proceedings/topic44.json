We aim to use RNA-sequencing to interrogate a large cohort of gliomas for targetable genetic fusions. Methods', ' Gliomas were profiled using the ArcherDx FusionPlex Assay at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences) and 52 gene targets were analyzed. Fusions with preserved kinase domains were investigated. Results', ' Among 404 gliomas tested, 39 (9.7%) presented potentially targetable fusions, of which 24/226 (11%) of glioblastoma (GBM), 5/42 (12%) of anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), 2/25 (8%) of grade II astrocytoma and 3 of 7 (43%) of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) harbored targetable fusions. In GBMs, 1 of 15 (6.7%) IDH-mutated tumors had a fusion while 22 of 175 (12.6%) IDH-wild type tumors had fusions. 46 oligodendroglial tumors were profiled and no fusions were seen, which was lower than frequency of fusions in astrocytic tumors (34/300, p = 0.0236). The most frequent fusions seen involved FGFR3 (N = 12), including 10 FGFR3-TACC3 (1 AA, 6 GBM and 3 glioma NOS); 1 FGFR3-NBR1 (AA) and 1 FGFR3-BRAP (GBM). 11 fusions involving MET were seen, 10 in GBM and 1 in AA. The most common MET fusion was PTPRZ1-MET (1 in AA and 4 in GBM), followed by ST7-MET (N = 3, GBM), CAPZA2-Met (N = 2, GBM) and TPR-MET (N = 1, GBM). 8 NTRK fusions were seen; 1 involving NTRK1 (BCAN-NTRK1, PA), 6 NTRK2 (1 NOS1AP-NTRK2 in AA; GKAP1-NTRK2, KCTD8-NTRK2, TBC1D2-NTRK2 and SOSTM1-NTRK2, 1 each in GBM and 1 VCAN-NTRK2 in grade II astrocytoma) and 1 NTRK3 (EML4-NTRK3 in GBM). EGFR fusions (2 EGFR-SEPT14 and 1 EGFR-VWC2) were seen in 3 GBMs, BRAF in 3 (1 KIAA1549-BRAF, 1 LOC100093631-BRAF in PA and 1 ZSCAN23-BRAF in glioma NOS) and PDGFRA (RAB3IP-PDGFRA, in GBM) in 1. C11orf95-RELA fusions were seen in 2 of 3 grade III ependymomas but not in the 2 grade II ependymomas. Conclusions', ' We report targetable fusion genes involving NTRK, MET, EGFR, FGFR3, BRAF and PDGFRA including novel fusions that havent been previously described in gliomas (e.g., EGFR-VWC2; FGFR3-NBR1).

        "Background":"['Glioblastomas are a highly aggressive and detrimental brain tumor, comprising 50% of all human gliomas. Glioblastomas have a median survival of less than two years after diagnosis because it has a high capacity for proliferation and is extremely chemoresistant. A common molecular event that characterizes glioblastoma is constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway. Activating mutation of BRAF (BRAF-V600E) has been reported in a subset of these tumors. We recently developed UI-152 as the new oncogenic BRAF targeting drug. In biochemical assays, UI-152 inhibited BRAF-V600E at very low nanomolar concentrations and showed a 10-fold higher potency against BRAF-V600E than another well-known oncogenic BRAF inhibitor, PLX4032/4720. In the present study, we evaluated the individual IC50 values of UI-152 from the cell growth inhibitory effects of the six malignant glioma cell lines with different BRAF mutational status. KG-1-C, NMC-G1, and DBTRG-05MG cell lines are heterozygous for BRAF-V600E; A-172, T98G, and U-87MG cell lines are homozygous for wild-type (WT) BRAF. The IC50 values of UI-152 were determined using crystal violet assays. UI-152 displayed the greatest level of selectivity for BRAF-mutant cells, inhibiting their proliferation more potently than that of cells expressing BRAF-WT. The IC50 of UI-152 in B-Raf mutant cells was less than 0.2 M, whereas the IC50 of cells expressing BRAF-WT were not reached even at 20 M UI-152. Corresponding immunoblot results showed that UI-152 completely abolished MEK-ERK phosphorylation in DBTRG-05MG cells harboring BRAF-V600E. However, in U-87MG cells expressing BRAF-WT, UI-152 caused the paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway. UI-152 induced the phosphorylation of MEK/ERK at 5 M but caused a return to control levels at 10 M in U-87MG cells. These results indicate that the genetic profile test of glioma is necessary prior to BRAF-targeted therapy to patients. Taken together, our data suggest that UI-152 may be an effective BRAF inhibitor and contribute to a potential therapeutic strategy for brain tumor patients with BRAF mutations.']",

        "Background":"['Low grade gliomas (LGG) are the most common tumors of the central nervous system in children, accounting for about 50% of all brain tumors. They represent a heterogeneous group of grade I and II tumors according to the WHO classification. Pediatric LGG, is associated with activation of BRAF through a tandem duplication that results in the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or through an activating point mutation of BRAF (predominantly V600E). More recent findings suggest that the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion is restricted to Grade 1 tumors (70-90%) whereas BRAF(V600E) occurs more frequently in Grade 2-4 tumors (~23%). Findings for BRAF mutation, similar to other tumors with activated BRAF (e.g. melanoma), and the phase I activity of MEK inhibitor in the PBTC-029 protocol, suggest that activated BRAF may provide a validated drug target. Previous studies from our lab indicate that, in the context of mutant BRAF, inhibition of MEK inhibits TORC1 signaling and may induce a ‘BRCA-like’ phenotype, through depletion of FANCD2. Potentially suppression of TORC1 could have effects on other DNA damage response pathways that could compensate for loss of FANCD2. To understand the consequences of MEK inhibition in the context of BRAF abreation in LGG we surveyed DNA repair genes that may be regulated via the MEK/TORC1 pathway in BRAF mutant cells. The objective of this particular study was to examine the mechanism and significance of MEK inhibition to the repair of DNA damage by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. For this study, we have used glioma cell lines having BRAF(V600E) mutation; the BT40 cell line was developed from patient-derived astrocytoma xenograft (PDX) model in mice in our lab and AM38c1 and DBTRG-05MG cells were generously provided by T. Nicolades. Annexin binding assay demonstrated that MEKi treatment significantly increased the percentage of apoptosis and necrosis of glioma cells. Human DNA repair PCR Array analysis identified MEKi induced down regulation of genes involved in Base Excision Repair (BER), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Mismatch Repair (MMR) and Double-Strand Break (DSB) repair pathways. DSB repair genes were further validated by real time qPCR analysis. Immunoblot analysis of glioma cell lines indicate that MEKi treatment enhanced the gamma-H2AX levels. To elucidate the mechanism of DSB repair pathway in presence of MEKi, clonogenic assay, nuclear foci formation assay, and GFP reporter assay for homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) are ongoing. Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time a previously unknown role for MEKi in treatment of glioma cells that involves inhibition of DNA double-strand break repair pathways. Further, we will examine the mechanism and significance of MEK/ERK and TORC1 signaling axis in regulation of DNA repair genes and its effect on LGG. Understanding how MEK plays a role in DNA repair pathways will be useful in maximizing treatment opportunities for childhood glioma.']",

In tumors with BRAF rearrangement, homozygous p16 deletion correlated with shorter PFS (P = 0.04). High MIB1 proliferation index strongly trended toward correlating with worse response to adjuvant therapy (P = 0.06). On multivariate analyses, the two most consistently powerful independent adverse prognostic markers were midline location (P = 0.0001) and p16 deletion (P = 0.03).

These data suggest that p16 deletion adversely impacts the outcomes of BRAF-driven gliomas; that high proliferation index may be a better marker of progression risk than BRAF; that BRAF rearrangement and BRAF V600E might not necessarily produce comparable outcomes; and that none of these markers is stronger than tumor location in determining prognosis in pediatric low-grade gliomas.']",

        "Background":"['INTRODUCTION', ' Recent studies have identified QKI-RAF1 and SRGAP3-RAF1 as CRAF (or RAF1) fusions in pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs). CRAF fusions, like BRAF fusions are activating mutations driving the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our previous findings suggest effective inhibition of BRAF fusion driven tumors using second-generation RAF inhibitor, PLX8394 and downstream MEK inhibitors (MEKi). We sought to investigate the mechanistic basis of response of CRAF fusions to clinically relevant RAF inhibitors and downstream pathway inhibitors, studying effect on CRAF dimerization profiles.METHODS', ' Heterologous cell model systems with stable expression of CRAF fusions were generated and used for testing downstream signaling pathways via immunoblotting. Soft agar assays and flank xenografts in immuno-compromised mice were used to characterize the oncogenic properties of CRAF fusions. Pathway activation and oncogenicity were further assessed in the presence of first - and second-generation RAF inhibitors, PLX4720 and PLX8394 respectively, MEKi, and mTOR inhibitors as single agents or in combination. Myc- and Flag-tagged constructs of CRAF fusions were used in co-immunoprecipitation assays to assess dimerization profiles of CRAF fusions with or without inhibitors.RESULTS', ' CRAF fusions activated the MAPK and PI3K pathways. CRAF fusions can homo-dimerize as well as hetero-dimerize with full-length BRAF, CRAF and the N-terminal fusion partner protein. Compared to BRAF fusions, CRAF fusions were not found to be responsive to any RAF inhibitors tested, including the paradox breaker PLX8394. We found that while PLX8394 decreased BRAF fusion-mediated dimerization, dimerization of CRAF fusion is unaffected. Clinically relevant MEKi AZD6244 and GSK1120212 both suppressed CRAF fusion driven pathways and growth in vitro but in mice flank xenografts, GSK1120212 partially inhibited CRAF fusion driven tumors. Since the CRAF fusions also activate the PI3K pathway, combinatorial targeting using MEKi and mTOR inhibitor, GSK1120212 and RAD001 respectively, was found to show robust tumor inhibition in vivo.CONCLUSIONS', ' This study demonstrates that CRAF fusions do not respond to RAF inhibitors, show partial response to single-agent MEKi, and respond robustly to combinatorial targeting of both MAPK and PI3K pathways via GSK1120212 and RAD001. Since PLX8394 does not affect CRAF fusion mediated dimerization, this provides a mechanistic basis for unresponsiveness to RAF inhibitors. Additionally, the N-terminal fusion partner also contributes to dimerization of CRAF fusions. Therefore, CRAF fusions are distinct from BRAF fusions in terms of responsiveness to targeted therapies due to dimerization profiles. These findings suggest molecular classification of PLGGs prior to treatment and provide preclinical rationale for combination therapy of CRAF fusion expressing PLGGs.']",

Surgically inoperable astrocytoma has a poor prognosis with greater than half of these patients dying from disease. We have developed two models of low-grade astrocytoma (BT-35, BT-40) by direct heterografting patient tumor into immune-deficient mice. Both tumor lines have multiple copies of BRAF, but only BT-40 has an activating mutation (V600E), and is exquisitely sensitive to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, whereas BT-35 is intrinsically resistant (Kolb et al. Ped Blood Cancer, 2010). Biochemical characterization showed that MEK1/2 were equally inhibited by AZD6244 treatment in both BT-35 and BT-40 xenografts, as demonstrated by the level and duration of inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2. However, inhibition of MEK1/2 had no effect on TORC1 signaling in BT-35 (insensitive) tumors whereas in BT-40 xenografts TORC1 signaling was completely inhibited by AZD6244. The pathway through which mutant BRAF controls TORC1 signaling is currently under evaluation. However, control of TORC1 by mutant BRAF potentially exposes these cells to therapeutic exploitation. We have shown previously that the TOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 potently suppresses FANCD2, a protein involved in interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair of DNA damage. Similar to the effect of AZD8055, within 4 days treatment of mice with AZD6244, FANCD2 levels are dramatically reduced and were no longer detected in BT-40 xenografts. Preliminary results show that inhibition of TOR signaling by AZD8055 is synergistic with daily radiation in rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts. We hypothesize that because MEK inhibition leads to suppression of TORC1 signaling and FANCD2 in BT-40 astrocytoma xenografts, that combination of AZD6244 with ionizing radiation or drugs that induce ICL will be selectively synergistic in the context of BRAF mutation. Experiments to test the hypothesis are ongoing. Supported by a Peletonia grant from the Ohio State University.']",

While BRAF mutations and MYBL1 rearrangements have recently been identified as diagnostic and treatment related oncogenic drivers in pediatric gangliogliomas and diffuse astrocytomas, respectively, for the majority of diffuse PLGGs the oncogenic driver(s) remain unknown. Recent efforts to identify new oncogenic drivers lack sufficient power to determine the true frequency of alterations in genes or to associate specific alterations with rare histological subtypes, such as Angiocentric gliomas (AGs). To address this issue, we performed genomic analysis of new and published data from 249 PLGGs including 19 AGs. We identified MYB-QKI fusions as a specific, recurrent, single candidate driver event in AGs. Although MYB is expressed during early brain development in a subset of progenitor cells, it is not known to play a role in normal cortical brain where AGs frequently occur. In vitro functional studies show MYB-QKI rearrangements promote tumorigenesis in mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs) through three mechanisms', ' MYB activation by truncation, enhancer translocation driving aberrant MYB-QKI expression, and hemizygous loss of the tumor suppressor QKI. Expression of the MYB-QKI fusion increases mNSC proliferation and activates known MYB target genes including KIT and CDK6. H3K27ac enhancer profiling of AG tumors demonstrate active enhancer elements are translocated proximally to the MYB promoter while in vitro promoter assays confirmed that QKI enhancer sequences activate the MYB promoter. Together with functional studies demonstrating that MYB-QKI can also bind and activate the MYB promoter, these data support a positive auto-regulatory feed-back loop model in which active MYB-QKI is able to drive its own expression through enhanced MYB-promoter-activation. Furthermore, when injected orthotopically into immunodeficient mice, expression of truncated MYB or MYB-QKI is sufficient to induce tumor formation that recapitulate histologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of AGs. Analysis of AG specific MYB-QKI fusion represents the first example of how a single driver rearrangement simultaneously transforms cells via three genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in a cancer.']",

Inhibition of MEK signaling in BT-40 cells or in xenografts lead to a complete suppression of TORC1 signaling and decreased levels of FANCD2 protein, whereas inhibition of TORC1 signaling was less in DBTRG-05MG cells and even less in AM380c1 cells. The level of TORC1 inhibition by selumetinib was associated with loss of clonogenic survival, and suppression of FANCD2 in vitro. In vivo we examined the sensitivity of BT-40 xenografts to selumetinib (75 mg/kg BID x 42 days, PO), XRT (10 Gy delivered as 2 Gy daily fractions), or selumetinib combined with XRT. For control tumors, median time to event was 17 days, whereas for XRT alone it was 80 days (P<0.0001). Selumetinib treatment induced complete regression of most tumors with progression starting around week 5 of the 6-week treatment period, consistent with previous data, with median time to event being 51 days (P<0.0001 vs control). In contrast to XRT or selumetinib as single agents, the combination caused complete regression of all tumors, with only 4 of 10 (40%) recurrent tumors within the 24 weeks observation period, and significantly better than radiation or selumetinib alone (P<0.0001 for both comparisons). These data add to studies that indicate synergy between XRT and MEK inhibitors, and suggest the possibility of potentiating the effect of XRT selectively in tumor cells by MEK inhibition in the context of mutant BRAF. Combining MEK inhibition with XRT may allow maintenance of tumor control at lower doses of XRT that would decrease long-term sequellae for children with BRAF-mutant brain tumors.']",

Detailed treatment and very long term outcome data was collected on all patients. Known pLGG-related alterations were detected using NanoString and QX200Droplet DigitalPCR. Molecular data was correlated with outcome and response to chemotherapy. Results', ' In our cohort of 614 patients, BRAF was found to be altered in 57% and wild-type (WT) in 43% of patients without neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). Among BRAF-WT we identified H3.3K27M, FGFR1-TACC1, MYBL1 and other alterations. Molecular alterations stratified pLGG into several risk groups. Ten-year progression free survival (PFS) was 72.3% for NF1, 69.5% for KIAA1549-BRAF, 53.5% for BRAF-WT, 30.3% for BRAF-V600E and 0% for H3.3K27M mutations (p < 0.0001). Similarly, overall survival (OS) at 10 years delineated difference between excellent survival of KIAA1549-BRAF and NF1 compared to BRAF-V600E and BRAF-WT (p = 0.0005). Interestingly, all patients with FGFR1-TACC1 and MYBL1 were alive despite observed progressions. Strikingly, response to chemotherapy determined by changes in tumor size at 6 months of therapy correlated with pLGG alteration. Objective response to first line chemotherapy was observed in 46% of patients with KIAA1549-BRAF and 35% of NF1. In contrast, only 15% BRAF-V600E and 18% BRAF-WT responded and 41% tumors grew after six months of chemotherapy. Moreover, 5-year PFS after chemotherapy was strikingly low for BRAF-V600E and BRAF-WT (25% and 31.9% respectively) compared to KIAA1549-BRAF (50%) and NF1 (76.7%) (p = 0.001). This translated to decreased OS for BRAFV600E and BRAF-WT patients (p = 0.042). Conclusions', ' Our study provides evidence that molecular alterations dictate the outcome of pLGG. KIAA1549-BRAF harbors excellent prognosis and choice of therapy should be made in favor of less toxic agents to minimize deleterious late effects.

Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of stilbenes in extracranial tumor models. Stilbenes, including resveratrol, were bioavailable in the brain even after low dose oral administration and there was no toxicity to normal tissue.

Mechanistically, stilbenes modulate NF-B, STAT3, wnt/-catenin signaling and also inhibits antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xl. While these molecules are critical in imparting chemoresistance, they are also pivotal in inducing immune-resistance and pro-tumor immune infiltration in gliomas. We hypothesized that stilbenes enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy while also inhibiting immune-suppression and -resistance in malignant gliomas via overlapping molecular mechanisms. We observed significant positive interaction between Temozolomide and Resveratrol for inhibition of glioma proliferation. Resveratrol induced apoptosis in gliomas via inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, while STAT3 activity was also inhibited. Importantly, Resveratrol significantly enhanced the expression of TRAIL-R2 and MIC A/B in gliomas, making them vulnerable to lysis by CTLs and NK cells.

        "Background":"[\"Gliomas are among the most prognostically discouraging neoplasia in human and there is basically no curative option for glioma patients. Nuclear factor B (NF-B) is a key effector associated with temozolomide (TMZ) resistance in glioma tumours. This is at least in part due to down-regulation of TNFAIP3, which is a critical negative regulator of NF-B activity. Downregulation of this gene is strongly associated with resistance to TMZ, but the molecular mechanism of dysregulation is largely unknown. We hypothesize that microRNAs that are implicated in the NF-B pathway may be important regulators of resistance to alkylating agents in glioma tumours.TNFAIP3 is a predicted target of brain-enriched microRNAs miR-125a and miR-125b. Consistent with these findings, luciferase activity assays of reporter plasmids containing miR-125a/b target sites revealed that TNFAIP3 is directly regulated by physiological concentrations of miR-125a/b. In addition, overexpression of miR-125a/b resulted in reduced mRNA and protein levels of TNFAIP3 and, as a consequence, also in a significant induction of NF-B activity. Consistent with these findings, glioblastoma cells overexpressing these miRNAs showed a strong upregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and BIRC3. Interestingly, this was significantly associated with resistance of glioma cells to TNFalpha- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis and also resistance to TMZ. A siRNA directed against TNFAIP3 and miR-125a/b gave rise to similar phenotypes suggesting that TNFAIP3 is a major target of miR-125a/b. In glioblastoma tissues, high level expression of either miRNA was highly correlated with nuclear localisation of NF-B confirming that miR-125a/b are implicated in NF-B signalling. Most remarkably, miR-125a/b expression was clearly associated with shorter overall survival of patients treated with TMZ, suggesting that these miRNAs are important predictors of response to therapy. However, we found no correlation between miR-125a/b levels and the MGMT methylation status.In conclusion, miR-125a/b expression is a predictor of the patient's response to chemotherapy. Since miR-125a/b confers resistance to TMZ, antisense miR-125a/b might potentially be used in adjuvant therapy for the treatment of glioma tumours.\"]",

Of these, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most aggressive tumors. The extraordinary invasiveness of GBM contributes to treatment failure and the grim prognosis of patients diagnosed with this tumor. Consequently, it is imperative to define further the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control GBM invasion and identify novel therapeutic targets. Melanoma differentiation associated gene-9 (MDA-9/syntenin) is a highly conserved PDZ domain-containing scaffolding protein that promotes invasion and metastasis in in vitro and in vivo in human melanoma models. The ability of single high-grade glioma cells to invade the surrounding normal brain tissue is an important characteristic that makes treating these tumors so difficult. Additionally, the highly angiogenic nature of GBM tumors contributes to their malignancy. Therefore, if MDA-9/syntenin plays a role in GBM invasion and angiogenesis, this gene or its downstream-regulated molecules could represent new targets that will aid in furthering the efficacy of current and future therapeutics. The objectives of our studies were to', ' (1) Determine the expression of MDA-9/syntenin in astrocytic tumors, (2) Assess the role of MDA-9/syntenin on the invasive ability of astrocytomas in vitro and in vivo, (3) Elucidate important molecular signaling events associated with mda-9/syntenin, and (4) Assess the role of MDA-9/syntenin on angiogenic potential in malignant astrocytomas. We now demonstrate that in primary human patient samples, MDA-9/syntenin is overexpressed in a large proportion of high-grade astrocytomas and this expression pattern correlates with tumor grade. Forced overexpression of MDA-9/syntenin enhanced Matrigel invasion, while knockdown of MDA-9/syntenin inhibited invasion, suppressed migration as measured by rate of gap closure, and reduced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Moreover, overexpression of MDA-9/syntenin in cells with low endogenous levels (Sw1783 and GBM5) increased activation of c-Src, p-P38MAPK, and NF-B, leading to elevated MMP2 expression. Conversely, the knockdown of MDA-9/syntenin in GBM cell lines T98G and U87MG resulted in reduced levels of p-Src, p-IB, and MMP2. GBM6 cells that stably express shmda-9 had decreased invasive ability and formed smaller tumors in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, knockdown of MDA-9/syntenin was found to decrease the production and secretion of IL-8, a known angiogenic cytokine. Using intracranial orthotopic xenografts, MDA-9/syntenin knockdown resulted in a less invasive tumor phenotype with decreased CD31 expression. Our findings indicate that MDA-9/syntenin is a novel and important mediator of invasion and angiogenesis, a key regulator of pathogenesis in GBM, and this gene represents a potential target for anti-invasive treatment in human astrocytomas.']",

Moreover, the intracellular signaling and transcription networks may differ in glioma stem cells, particularly among cells with different subtypes. We have recently demonstrated that cancer stem cells isolated from glioma patients can be segregated into either a proneural or mesenchymal subtype based on their gene expression pattern. The oncogenic activity of genes like c-MYC in glioma stem cells and differences between glioma stem cell subtypes, such as NF-B activation, raises questions as to whether GSK3 inhibition will be effective against both subtypes and if their effects utilize distinct mechanisms of inhibition. In this study, we examine the effects of two established and two novel GSK3 inhibitors on glioma stem cells with respect to tumor subtype and investigate their mechanisms of action. Our in vitro data shows that GSK3 inhibition significantly reduces growth and causes cell death in both proneural and mesenchymal glioma stem cells. Using a glioma stem cell xenograft model, we test the effectiveness of GSK3 inhibition as a single agent and in conjunction with clinically-approved chemotherapeutic agents. The characterization of cancer stem cell inhibitors and their effectiveness in different tumor subtypes has significant clinical implications. Our work supports the therapeutic potential of novel GSK3 inhibitors for the treatment of malignant gliomas.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND Approximately 200.000 people are diagnosed with a primary brain tumor each year worldwide. The most common type of primary brain tumor (40%) are gliomas. Currently available prognostic markers require evaluation of tumor tissue, such as 1p and 19q choromosome co-deletion in oligodendroglial tumors, MGMT promoter methylation for glioblastomas (GBMs), and IDH mutations in several glioma subtypes. Serum biomarkers that correlate with tumor status have prognostic and predictive value and could significantly improve the care for glioma patients. In addition biomarkers could provide unique information related to longitudinal response to therapy. The only clinically validated serum marker of prognosis and disease status in high grade gliomas is serum YKL-40, a chitinase homolog also called human cartilage glycoprotein 39 or chitinase 3-like 1. DESIGN/METHODS For the discovery phase we used a set of 31 cerebrospinal fluid samples. This sample set included 5 CSF samples of patients with a GBM and 26 controls. These samples were digested by trypsin and subsequently measured by LCMS-Orbitrap. The acquired data were analyzed using a database search and a subsequent analyses of the spectral counts by Scaffold. The spectral counts for each individual identified protein are used as a semi quantitative measure for protein abundance. RESULTS / CONCLUSIONS From the total list of 771 identified proteins, candidate biomarker proteins were selected that showed a significant difference between the control and GBM (p<0.01) and were at least 3 fold higher in spectral count than in the control group. Abundant serum proteins were removed to avoid inclusion of proteins that relate to the disruption of the blood-CSF barrier. Eventually, a list of eleven proteins was obtained that included 14-3-3 protein gamma, 72 kDa type IV collagenase, Alpha-enolase, Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), Fetuin-B, Glial fibrillary acidic protein, Insulin-like growth factor II, Metalloproteinase inhibitor 1, Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1, SPARC, IGF binding protein 2 and Metalloproteinase inhibitor 2. Many of the identified candidate markers have been previously reported in literature in relation to glioma including the clinically validated serum marker for glioma YKL-40. We are now planning a validation of these markers in a set of serum samples of glioma patients.']",

Previously we and others have reported that hotair promotes glioblastoma progression by regulating cell cycle. However, further mechanism still needs to be explored. The wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is a crucial factor in the development of many cancers. B-catenin is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates multiple genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and EMT that contribute to glioma development.Methods', 'Positive correlation genes of hotair were picked up from CGGA (Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas) database by bioinformatics analysis. Real Time PCR is used to test the mRNA expression levels in U87 cells and astrocytes. Western blot is emplored to determine PKM2 expression after knocking down hotair.

Bioinformatics analysis indicated that various genes play important roles on cell cycle are positively correlated with hotair. Theses genes might be the executors of hotair on cell cycle regulating. We constructed a top 18 hotair-related genes network by connectivity. To test the hypothesis, we knock down hotair expression in U87 cells, and found out that FOXM1, CCNA2, CEP55, CENEP, CCNB2, HMMR, NCAPG, NUSAP were down-regulated significantly. In addition, overexpression of hotair in astrocytes could upregulate the mRNA of those genes. To further explore the regulatory mechanism, we analyed the promoter of these hotair-regulated genes and found out b-catenin/TCF4 binding site on all of them. This indicated that hotair might upregulate cell cycle associated genes through b-catenin/TCF4 pathway. FH535 is an inhibitor of wnt/b-catenin. The mRNA expression of these genes could be suppressed by FH535 treatment, which confirms the promoter analysis. It is reported that PKM2 could promote b-catenin nuclear translocation. Interestingly, we found out that binding site of miR-330 exists on both of hotair and PKM2 mRNA. Knocking-down of hotair inhibited PKM2 mRNA and protein expression in U87, U87vIII, U251 and LN229 cells.

        "Background":"['Natural killer (NK) cells safeguard against early tumor formation by seeking out and destroying transformed target cells in a process referred to as NK immunosurveillance. While it is clear that malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) evade NK-mediated tumor suppression, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs remain unknown. We now show that shRNA-mediated knockdown of the -galactoside-binding lectin, galectin-1 (gal-1), in malignant glioma cells leads to the failure to form lethal intracranial tumors in RAG1-/- mice, a mouse strain devoid of adaptive immunity. However, gal-1 deficient glioma growth is fully restored on implantation into the brain of severely immunocompromised NOD-scid IL2Rg null mice, which lack both adaptive and innate immune function, thus implicating the innate immune response in the early rejection of gal-1 deficient glioma. Immunodepletion of NK cells in RAG1-/- or C57BL/6J mice using anti-asialo GM1 or anti-NK1.1 antibodies permit the growth of large gal-1 deficient gliomas, while macrophage depletion with clodronate liposomes only permits limited tumor growth. This combined result suggests that NK cells and macrophages may work together to achieve gal-1 deficient glioma rejection. Antigen-specific IFN- ELISpot assays using splenocytes from immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice indicate that gal-1 deficient glioma is cleared prior to the onset of an adaptive anti-tumor immune response. Flow cytometric analysis of brain tumor-infiltrating immune cells reveal that gal-1 deficient gliomas contain significantly more macrophages and granzyme B+ NK cells compared to gal-1 expressing gliomas. In-vitro experiments further show that gal-1 deficient glioma cells are inherently over 3-times more sensitive to NK-mediated tumor lysis, fail to suppress pro-inflammatory (M1) microglial activation, and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-12p70, and CXCL2. We conclude that glioma-derived gal-1 is a powerful inhibitor of NK-mediated cytotoxicity in-vivo, and predict that its suppression will be of therapeutic value in the treatment of human malignant brain tumors by dramatically heightening anti-tumor NK immunosurveillance.']",

        "Background":"['There are more than 14,000 new cases of malignant high grade glioma diagnosed each year in the US, and although surgical resection, radiation, and cytotoxic therapies are available, these current treatment methods are not curative. Inhibitor of DNA Binding 2 (Id2), a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein, functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and is highly expressed in glioma. Recent data from our laboratory defines a critical role for Id2 in the pathogenesis of a subset of glioma known as proneural glioma. Id2 protein function has been characterized in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) where it acts to suppress differentiation and enhance cell cycle progression. These are two key characteristics that are shared with glioma-derived stem cells. We have identified three phosphorylation sites on Id2 in proliferating NPCs using mass spectrometry, and prepared altered Id2 molecules that cannot be phosphorylated at each of these sites. Id2-/- NPCs expressing WT and phosphorylation-site-ablated Id2 have been prepared to examine the role of Id2 phosphorylation in mediating its interactions with binding partners and in modulating the rate of proteasome-dependent degradation. We found an increased level of Id2 in NPCs expressing a mutant form of Id2 that cannot by phosphorylated when compared with NPCs expressing WT Id2. Moreover, the level of WT Id2 protein decreases when NPCs exit the cell cycle; however, unphosphorylated Id2 resists this degradation and exhibits a longer half-life. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) experiments revealed that unphosphorylated Id2 molecules bind significantly less than WT Id2 to several anaphase promoting complex (APC) subunits. These findings suggested a possible mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation of Id2 in NPCs. Understanding the effect of Id2 phosphorylation in modulating steady state levels of this important protein will inform future studies designed to identify pathways of interest in the transformation of NPCs and the malignant progression of NPC-initiated glioma.

Separate studies have identified populations of neural stem and progenitor -like GBM cells, however the contribution of these cells types to tumor progression and the response to targeted therapy are poorly understood. Small molecules (such as vemurafenib) targeting the most common MAPK-activating mutation, BRAFV600E, are currently entering clinical trials for treatment of high-grade glioma. Understanding the contribution of different cell types to treatment responses will be necessary for the design of effective adjuvant therapeutic strategies.We show that activating MAPK pathway gene mutations in GBM correlate with elevated expression levels of oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) and neural stem cell (NSC)-associated genes. Cells expressing CD133 and NG2 coexist in human GBM and BRafV600E expressing mouse neurosphere cultures, and maintain some of their respective neural stem and progenitor-like properties.In isogenic mouse cells expressing BRafV600E, NG2+ cells expand rapidly and symmetrically, while rates of asymmetric division are unaffected in slow-proliferating CD133+ cells. Tracing of proliferation rate with the membrane-associated dye PKH-26 reveals heterogeneity in the proliferation rate of CD133+ cells, but not proliferative NG2+ cells. BRAF-targeted inhibition of human GBM cells with PLX4720, the tool compound of vemurafenib, reduces S-phase entry of NG2+ cells, yet CD133+ cells are less affected. Interestingly targeted inhibition of components of the asymmetric division machinery selectively disrupts G2-M progression in CD133+ cells. The functionally divergent populations of CD133-expressing NSC-like cells will likely be therapeutically problematic with mono-therapeutic approaches. These data point to a differential regulation of key cell cycle processes between CD133+ stem-like cells and NG2+ OPC-like cells, that will inform the intelligent design of compound treatment strategies.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Radiation and chemoresistance have been attributed to a small population of cells known as glioma stem cells (GSCs) or glioma initiating cells (GICs). In the present study, we studied the effect of ionizing radiation on the progression of cell cycle of glioma initiating cells, non glioma initiating cells (non-GICs), and the respective parental cell lines (U251 and U87). Initial experiments showed that GICs were resistant to lower doses of radiation (3 and 5 Gy) as compared to parental and non-GICs. Radiation dosage of 10 Gy induced significant G2/M arrest as early as 12 and 24 hours in non-GICs (U251 and U87) and parental cell lines (U251 and U87), respectively and a low percentage of GICs were observed in the G2/M phase 48 hours after radiation. Apart from cathepsin B and uPAR, expression levels of cyclin B1, pcdc2, pchk2 and pERK were also elevated when cells were exposed to radiation. shRNA-mediated simultaneous knockdown of cathepsin B and uPAR (pCU) decreased radiation-induced expression of cyclin B1, pcdc2, pchk2 and pERK and induced apoptosis. Further, immunoblot analysis indicated that cathepsin B and uPAR downregulation reduced the expression of neural stem cell markers, such as CD133, Sox-2 and Bmi-1. Activation of pERK played an important role in inducing the G2/M arrest of GICs of both cell lines as its inhibition induced cell differentiation and sensitized the cells to radiation. Irradiation induced aggressive tumors in vivo and the knockdown of uPAR and cathepsin B significantly decreased radiation-induced tumor growth. Thus, these results indicate that uPAR and cathepsin B downregulation sensitized GICs to ionizing radiation and targeting these proteins could be an efficient approach to eradicate tumors, particularly GICs in the tumor bulk.']",

The mechanism driving the development and recurrence of GBM is still largely unknown which greatly limits the successful treatment of this disease. The tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member TNFRSF19 (TROY) is a type I cell surface receptor protein containing the highly conserved TNFR cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular domain and a tumor necrosis factor-receptor-associated factor (TRAF) - binding sequence in the cytoplasmic domain. We recently demonstrated that increased expression of TROY stimulated glioma cell migration in vitro and increased cell invasion in an organotypic brain slice model. Conversely, siRNA mediated knockdown of TROY expression inhibited glioma cell migration. In addition, profiling of TROY in brain tumor samples indicated that TROY mRNA expression was significantly increased in GBM samples, directly correlated with increasing glial tumor grade, and inversely correlated with patient outcome suggesting that TROY expression may play a role in GBM invasion and is a good indicator of survival outcome. In the current study, we investigated the role of TROY in therapeutic resistance and survival signaling. We report that TROY protein expression was significantly increased in patient GBM tumor samples with TROY mRNA exhibiting increased expression in the invasive cell population. Aberrant expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in situ using glial-specific gene transfer in transgenic mice induced astrocyte migration within the brain supporting an important role for TROY in glioma cell migration. Notably, increased TROY expression did not increase cell proliferation but increased resistance of glioma cells to both radiation and temozolomide induced apoptosis while knockdown of TROY increased temozolomide sensitivity. TROY induced resistance to TMZ was dependent upon Akt and NF-B activation. We also report that TROY induced NF-B phosphorylation and stimulation of migration required the membrane proximal region of the TROY cytoplasmic domain and that knockdown of TROY expression increased survival in a xenograft model. The current results further support a role for TROY in GBM and suggest that targeting TROY and its signaling pathway represents a potential approach to increase tumor vulnerability and improve the therapeutic response of glioblastoma.']",

Further, pUC treatment also inhibited the PKC/integrin signal through FAK by disintegrating the association of FAK and the cytoskeletal molecules vinculin and -actinin. It was also observed that inhibition of radiation-induced ERK phosphorylation by pUC directed a negative feedback mechanism over the FAK signaling molecules that led to an extensive reduction in the cytoskeletal organization, and thereby generating a migratory arrest. Further confirmation was obtained by treating the cells with U0126 (10 M), a MEK inhibitor, and rottlerin (200 M), a PKC inhibitor. pUC treatment efficiently inhibited the co-localization of pPKC//integrin1, PKC/integrin1, FAK/vinculin and FAK/-actinin in the brain tumor sections of mice implanted with glioma cells and GICs.

        "Background":"['Discoidin domain receptor (DDR) belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase family l and is activated by binding to its ligand (collagen). Once activated, DDR undergoes autophosphorylation and triggers cellular signaling for proliferation and invasion. While studies have shown that high grade glioma expressed high levels of DDR1 and signifies poor clinical outcome, the underlying mechanism(s) is not known. We attempted to exploit this pathway for future treatment. DDR comprises of 2 members (DDR1 and DDR2). DDR1 is composed of five isoforms, i.e. a,b,c,d, and e. (d and e are inactive). We have studied the expression of both DDR1 (a,b,c) and DDR2 in 6 glioma cell lines (U118, Glioma1, SW1783, U87, A172, and U373). All 6 cell lines express all three subtypes of DDR1 as well as DDR2 by RT-PCR . DDR1 protein was also detected in all 6 cell lines. Knockdown DDR1 inhibited glioma cell migration by scratch assay and deactivated MMP9 by zymography analysis, which was best seen in Glioma1, U-118, and much less in A-172 and U-373. Knock down DDR1 also decreased AKT, ERK, and Bcl-xl which suggests positive regulation of these prosurvival proteins by DDR1. Since there is no inhibitor of DDR1, we have used Brefeldin A (BFA), which can block procollagen (ligand for DDR1 and DDR2) secretion. Treatment with BFA results in decreased DDR 1a,b and c mRNA in U-118, Glioma SW1783 and U-87 and no change in A-172 and U373. A decrease in DDR2 also was seen in U-118 and SW1783 and no change was seen in the other 4 cell lines. The ID50 of BFA ranged from 6 to 13 ng/ml in U-118, Glioma1 SW1783 and U-87 and 23 ng/ml in A-172. Treatment with BFA also inhibited cell migration (scratch assay) in Glioma 1, U-118 and SW1783 but not in U-373 and A-172. A-172 and U-373 did not possess procollagen alpha 1 type 1 which may explain the insensitivity to BFA. Silencing DDR1 does not significantly alter the growth inhibitory effect of Glioma1 U-118 or A-172. This may be due to the compensatory increase of DDR2. Thus, our data showed that glioma cells possess all DDR 1 subtypes as well as DDR2. Silencing DDR1 results in decreased AKT, ERK and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xl and migration, suggesting its role in cellular proliferation and invasion. However, decreasing the available ligand (procollagen) from exiting the cells only affected DDR1 and DDR2 expression in certain cell lines (U-118 , SW1783). Interestingly, these 2 cell lines are also very sensitive to BFA (ID50 of 6 ng/mL) and possess high levels of procollagen type1 (both alpha1 and alpha 2 ) which are the ligands for both DDR1 and DDR2, while the cell line which had the least effect (A-172) did not express procollagen alpha 1 type 1. Overall, the presence of DDR family in malignant gliomas may not indicate that this is a major pathway for proliferation /survival and invasion . However, the presence of both ligand(s) and receptor(s) are important for future application to treat malignant gliomas targeting this pathway.']",

Current imaging techniques cannot distinguish if these changes are due to recurrent disease or treatment-related brain injury (TRBI).  Serum biomarkers could help noninvasively make this distinction.  Brain-specific proteins have been used as markers of the severity of other brain injuries including stroke, hypoxia, and traumatic brain injury.  We hypothesized that similar changes could be observed following brain CRT and could provide preliminary data supporting biomarker development for TRBI.  Methods', '  Patients receiving concurrent radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) for malignant glioma were eligible. The study was approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Serum is sampled before CRT, in the last week of CRT, and at 1 month, 6 mos, and 1 year after CRT.  Neurologic exams, cognitive testing, and imaging are performed at the same intervals. Serum samples were tested for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurogranin, ICAM-5, B-syn-nuclein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).  Samples were measured in duplicate using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay.   Results', '  Data are available for the first 7 patients enrolled in this study. All of the tested markers except GFAP were measurable at baseline and all other time points.  None of the markers were consistently elevated during the last week of CRT or at any other time point during follow-up.  Three patients had resection of suspected recurrent disease.  Two had recurrent tumor and 1 had no evidence of disease.  No correlation was apparent with the findings at surgery and serum levels of GFAP, neurogranin, ICAM-5, B-synuclein, or BDNF.  Conclusions', '  This study describes a mechanism for identifying a serum protein marker of TRBI.  Preliminary results did not identify elevations in any of the selected markers immediately after CRT when signs of TRBI should be apparent or at other points in the clinical course.  Testing of additional serum markers is needed to identify a biomarker of TRBI which would provide valuable information for managing high-grade glioma patients.']",

Currently, optimal management includes resection, postoperative radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide. However, even when this most aggressive treatment is delivered, the median survival is just over a year. We hypothesized that insensitivity to chemotherapy can be attributed to 3 possible mechanisms', ' (a) alterations in DNA repair pathways; (b) alterations in cell cycle checkpoints; and (c) selection of cells with \"stem-like\" phenotypes. Methods', ' In a retrospective study, we analyzed tumor tissue from 58 patients that had surgical resection of their GBM or AA between Dec 02 and Dec 08. We also analyzed tumor tissue from 13 patients with resected recurrent disease. DNA repair proteins (MGMT, MSH2), death avoidance proteins (p53, pAKT, XIAP), and stem cell markers (Nestin, CD133, ABCG2) were detected by immunohistochemistry. Correlative analyses between each marker and Overall Survival (OS) were performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results', ' The median OS of our population was 20 months. As expected, performance status and histology were associated with outcome. In addition, we found that 2 of the 8 markers analyzed, pAKT and ABCG2, had a statistically significant association with OS. pAKT is a key member of an activated EGFR pathway, which promotes cell survival. ABCG2 is a toxin pump used as a marker for stem cells. Our results indicate that higher expression of pAKT and ABCG2 reduces the effectiveness of therapy and leads to decreased survival. Comparative analyses between primary and recurrent tumors indicate that the expression of the 8 proteins remains relatively unchanged with the notable exception of MGMT. MGMT confers resistance to temozolomide by reversing alkylation damage. The prevalence of this protein was higher in recurrences than in primaries. Conclusions', ' This study supports the relevance of the EGFR pathway in gliomas and suggests a role for anti-EGFR therapy in patients with increased pAKT expression. The apparent selection of higher MGMT expressing cells in recurrent disease discourages the use of alkylating agents in second line therapy and highlights the potential of agents that reduce MGMT levels.']",

        "Background":"['Within the adult mammalian brain the asymmetric distribution of cell-fate determinants during mitosis maintains a balance between differentiated and self-renewing cells. We have previously shown that disruption of asymmetric divisions in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) causes cells to aberrantly self-renew and fail to differentiate, giving rise to oligodendroglioma (Sugiarto et al. Cancer Cell; 2011; 20; 320-40).Here we proposed to address whether asymmetric divisions are also disrupted in precursors of malignant astrocytoma, a highly aggressive and therapy resistant type of glioma.The constitutively active BRaf mutant BRafV600E is mutated in a subset of malignant astrocytoma alongside deletion of Cdkn2a, and can transform NSCs into astrocytoma precursors (Huillard et al. PNAS; 2012; 109; 8710-5). We used BRafCA mice (Dankort et al. Genes Dev. 2007; 21; 379-84) with Cre recombinase-activated expression of BRafV600E and deletion of Ink4a/Arf to generate an in situ model of NSC-derived malignant astrocytoma. In vivo studies to assess asymmetric division and related defects were complemented by studies of BRafV600E expressing, Ink4a/Arf-deleted neurosphere cells in cell-based assays of asymmetric division, self-renewal and differentiation.Our results provide unprecedented evidence that BRafV600E, although uniformly expressed in NSC and their progeny, disrupts asymmetric divisions in a cell-type specific manner. NSCs continue to divide asymmetrically but their progeny, including OPC, divide more symmetrically and exhibit defects in differentiation and proliferation. These defects are reversible with BRafV600E-specific inhibitor PLX4720, and are associated with increased expression of the mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1, increased pERK and decreased pAKT.These data describe a mechanism by which NSC-targeted expression of BRafV600E may generate numerous subpopulations of tumor cells with distinct characteristics. This heterogeneity may mirror that seen in malignant astrocytoma, which has often been associated with high incidence of therapy resistance (Burger et al. Cancer. 1985; 56; 1106-11).']",

        "Background":"['Patients with malignant brain tumors have a median survival of approximately one year following diagnosis, regardless of currently available treatments which include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Although there have been advances in the development of novel treatments, targeted therapies face the challenge of overcoming phenotypic variability resulting from tumor heterogeneity. One phenotypic trait shared by virtually all cancer cells is dysregulation of metabolism. It has therefore been postulated that one approach to treating brain tumors may be through metabolic alteration such as that which occurs through the use of the ketogenic diet (KD). The KD is high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has been utilized for the non-pharmacologic treatment of refractory epilepsy. We and others have shown that this diet enhances survival in mouse models of malignant gliomas. Further, radiation in combination with KD was synergistic, and survival was significantly increased over radiation treatment alone. To gain an understanding of the mechanism(s) by which the KD exerts anti-tumor effects and enhances the efficacy of radiation therapy we performed gene expression profiling analyses on tumor tissue and non-tumor containing brain using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. To identify changes in gene expression representing chronic effects of KD and radiation plus KD we harvested tissue when the animals became symptomatic. We previously reported that tissue from animals maintained on the KD in the absence of radiation treatment showed a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression compared to those maintained on a standard diet (Stafford et al, Nutr and Metab (7)', '74, 2010). We now report that peritumoral edema is significantly reduced early in tumor progression in animals fed the KD when compared to those fed a standard rodent diet. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of animals treated with radiation and KD demonstrated alterations in the chronic expression of crucial genes involved in radiation-induced inflammation including COX-2 and the nuclear transcription factor NF-B, both of which are implicated in radioresistance. We are repeating these studies using tissues harvested shortly after radiation therapy to identify genes acutely affected by radiation therapy in animals fed a KD. Taken together, our data to date suggests that the KD may be interfering with the radiation-induced inflammatory signaling network implicated in tumor progression. A greater understanding of the effects of the ketogenic diet as an adjuvant therapy will allow for a more rational approach to its clinical use.']",

We used a candidate approach to screen for secreted factors that were preferentially used by GSCs but not NSTCs. Expression was assessed by Western blot, and confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in vitro and in human and mouse GBM tissues. Ligand-receptor interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Rac activity was assessed by Rac-GTP pulldown. Co-culture epistasis experiments were performed using knockdown and recombinant protein approaches. Glioma stem cell marker analysis (CD133, Sox2, Olig2), cell viability (ATP-dependent assays), apoptosis (TUNEL, PI/AnnexinV, cleaved caspase 3/7), self-renewal (tumorsphere formation and limiting dilution assay) and invasion (transwell migration assay) were performed.

GSCs were used to establish orthotopic xenograft models of glioblastoma and tumor growth and animal survival were assessed.Results', ' We have found that GSCs preferentially secrete Sema3C and coordinately express PlexinA2/D1 receptors to activate Rac1/NF-B signaling in an autocrine and paracrine loop to promote their own survival. Importantly, Sema3C is not expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) or NSTCs. Disruption of Sema3C induced apoptosis of GSCs, but not NPCs or NSTCs, and suppressed tumor growth in orthotopic models of glioblastoma. Introduction of activated Rac1 rescued the Sema3C knockdown phenotype in vivo. Furthermore, GSCs that expressed high levels of Plexin receptors were more resistant to radiation, and Sema3C and Plexin receptors were upregulated after irradiation. Together, these data support that Sema3C signaling contributes to radiation resistance.Conclusions', ' Our study supports targeting Sema3C to break this GSC-specific autocrine/paracrine loop to improve glioblastoma treatment, potentially with a high therapeutic index.']",

It arises in the spinal cord, supratentorial brain, and most commonly in children, the posterior fossa (PF). We recently reported the identification of two molecularly and clinically distinct subgroups of PF ependymoma, which we named Group A and B. While patients with Group B tumors harbor a large number of gross chromosomal gains and losses (approx. 17 arm events per tumor) and have favorable prognoses (5 year PFS = 92%), patients with Group A tumors have balanced genomic profiles (approx. 1 arm event per tumor) with poor clinical outcomes (5 year PFS = 24%). We hypothesized that aberrant DNA methylation could be a mechanism driving the tumorigenesis of Group A PF ependymoma. To this end, we isolated methylated DNA in 92 ependymomas by Methyl Binding Domain 2 protein assisted recovery, and hybridized enriched DNA to promoter tiling arrays (Nimblegen). Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering we determined that the DNA methylation profiles of ependymoma were regionally specified, dividing tumors into subgroups according to their anatomical origin. Using both gene expression and DNA methylation platforms, we identified a subset of PF ependymoma, which clustered with spinal tumors, supporting the vast molecular differences between Group A and B PF ependymoma. We next compared the number of methylated genes identified in Group A versus B, and observed that Group A tumors exhibited a greater number of methylated genes at specific CpG islands, a feature described as a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in glioma, colon cancer, and breast cancer. We validated these findings in a non-overlapping cohort of 48 PF ependymomas, analyzed using a different array technology (Illumina Infinium 450K). Using various unsupervised clustering methods (HCL, K-MEANS, NMF, and SOM), we verified that Group A and B exhibited highly distinct DNA methylation profiles. Further, we confirmed that Group A tumours were defined by a greater overall number of methylated genes (A', ' 855, B', ' 233; Wilcoxon-Rank Sum Test), and a greater number of methylated genes per tumour (A', ' 511, B', ' 425; Wilcoxon-Rank Sum Test). We performed Gene Set Enrichment analysis and observed that many genes methylated in Group A exhibited a significant overlap with genes marked by the polycomb repressor (PRC2) complex in embryonic stem cells (p<0.0001, FDR<0.1%), a phenomenon seen in other cancer CIMPs. We propose two diverse mechanisms leading to tumourigenesis in Group A and B ependymoma. The greater number of chromosomal alterations in Group B suggests a Chromosomal Instability (CIN) phenotype, while the greater number of methylated CpG islands in Group A suggests a CpG island Methylator (CIMP) phenotype. Understanding these underlying mechanisms driving Group A and B pathogenesis may yield new leads for subgroup-specific treatments of PF ependymoma.']",

These results were supported by immunohistochemical staining for CD31 which also revealed abnormal vessel structure in the tumors from animals fed SD but not in those fed KC, suggesting a normalizing effect by the KC. Furthermore gene expression profiling demonstrated that KC decreases expression of a group of genes involved in angiogenesis and vessel structuring including the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) and angiopoetin 1 receptor (TEK), integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (TIMP1).

        "Background":"['Treatment for glioblastoma (GBM) remains essentially palliative due to the aggressive infiltration of GBM cancer cells into normal brain tissue. In addition, the existence of a small subpopulation of highly resistant cells known as glioma-initiating cells (GICs), which escape radiation and chemotherapy-induced cell death, makes GBM currently incurable. Proteases, such as uPAR and cathepsin B that are responsible for cancer invasion and metastasis, are often detected in higher amounts in malignant tumors. In the present study, shRNA-mediated knockdown of uPAR and cathepsin B (pUC), alone or in combination with radiation, simultaneously inhibited migration and induced apoptosis of 5310 and 4910 non-GICs and GICs by regulating the JNK-MAPK pathway. Immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses showed pUC treatment resulted in an increase in the levels of the phospho-JNK (p-JNK), which was mostly localized to the nucleus. We also observed an increase in the levels of p-JNK with radiation and with full-length uPAR and cathepsin B; however, it was confined to the cytoplasm of the cells. Depletion of cytosolic p-JNK with pUC treatment and/or with the JNK inhibitor decreased migration by downregulating the expression of the migratory molecules. Immunoprecipitation analysis and co-localization studies further confirmed the involvement of the cytosolic p-JNK in promoting migration of the glioma cells. The increase in the expression of nuclear p-JNK with pUC treatment increased the expression of apoptotic molecules, as observed by the western blot analysis. MTT assay revealed that non-GICs and GICs were rescued from pUC-induced cell death when treated in combination with a JNK inhibitor, which further confirms the importance of nuclear JNK in eliciting an apoptotic signal. In summary, cytosolic p-JNK aids cell migration while nuclear p-JNK drives cells toward cell death. As such, pUC treatment induced the translocation of p-JNK from cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby simultaneously inhibiting migration and inducing apoptosis of non-GICs and GICs.']",

In human glioma xenograft cells 4910 and 5310, irradiation (IR; 8 Gy) elevated Stat3 and p65 phosphorylation and persistent nuclear translocation in correlation with massive increases in cellular and soluble ICAM-1 levels. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed enhanced nuclear phospho-p65/phospho-Stat3 and acetyl-p65/phospho-Stat3 interactions along with enhanced invasiveness and migration in IR-treated cells. Promoter analysis indicated presence of adjacent NF-B- and Stat3-consensus binding elements in the proximal promoter and the proximal intron-1 of the ICAM-1 promoter, whereas overlapping NF-B/Stat3 binding motifs were identified in the distal intron-1 region. ChIP binding and promoter/luciferase reporter assays showed that IR induced prominent binding of both Stat3 and NF-B to the proximal intron-1 region followed by the distal intron-1 and the proximal promoter regions on the ICAM-1 gene. Individual treatments with Stat3.si or JSH-23 blocked the occupancy of both Stat3 and p65 onto the ICAM-1 promoter and prevented subsequent ICAM-1-mediated migration and invasion. In addition, constitutive activation of Stat3 and NF-B by Stat3C or TNF- significantly elevated IR-induced migration and invasion. In vivo orthotropic experiments in nude mice showed that the Stat3.si treatment reduced tumor growth and IR-induced phopsho-Stat3/phospho-p65 and ICAM-1 expression when compared to pSV-treated controls. These results suggest that both p65 and Stat3 bind to the intronic region of ICAM-1 promoter to induce its optimal transcription in IR-treated cells and abrogation of IR-induced p65/Stat3 binding inhibits ICAM-1-mediated enhancement of malignancy in post-irradiated tumor cells.

        "Meeting_name":" The role of human endogenous retroviral proteins in the development of Merlin-deficient tumors and as potential drug targets",
        "Background":"[\"Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder caused by loss of the tumour suppressor Merlin leading to the development of multiple tumours of the nervous system such as schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Merlin-deficient tumours may also occur sporadically including all schwannomas, 50-60% meningiomas and 29-38% ependymomas. Loss of functional Merlin have been also observed in other tumours e.g. mesothelioma, melanoma, and a portion of glioma, prostate and breast cancers. Current therapies for Merlin-deficient tumours, comprising surgery and radiosurgery are invasive and not fully effective therefore the emphasis has to be made on the development of new effective drug-based treatments.Schwannoma is the most common Merlin-deficient tumour, a hallmark for NF2 and a model for all other Merlin-deficient tumours. We have developed the human in vitro model for schwannoma to study tumour pathobiology and for drug testing. Using this model we have shown strong overexpression and activation of ErbB2/ErbB32, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), Insulin like growth factor receptor-I (IGF-IR) and activation of Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and Wnt/-catenin signalling pathways. Following, we have successfully tested new drugs such as AZD6244, Sorafenib, BEZ235, Lapatinib, Imatinib and Nilotinib. These studies revealed that schwannomas pathological proliferation, survival and adhesion is regulated by highly complex networks interacting and compensating each other resulting in increased tumour pathology. We suggest that the inhibition of a single target will not be sufficient to stop tumour growth and that multi-targeted therapy would be needed.Endogenous retroviruses are viruses that have integrated themselves into germ-line chromosomes and thereby become part of the human genome sequence (8%). One group, HERVK, has been found to be overexpressed in several cancers and is currently being investigated as potential immunotherapy targets. Our preliminary data demonstrate that HERVK envelope, capsid, Rec and Np9 proteins are overexpressed in human primary schwannoma cells and tissues. Additionally, HERVK envelope and capsid proteins are released from schwannoma cells. HERVK overexpression is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational level and is partially Merlin dependent. Anti-HERVK antibodies reduced schwannoma proliferation, pERK/pAKT/ pFAK and cyclin D1 levels and increased expression of p53. Also, pre-incubation of schwannoma cells with anti-HERVK antibodies prior to treatment with AZD6244 potentiated drug's efficiency. An HIV/HERVK protease inhibitor, Ritonavir, also decreased proliferation of schwannoma cells and increased the efficiency of AZD6244, Sorafenib and BEZ235 when combined. We suggest that HERVK plays a relevant role in schwannoma and possibly other Merlin-deficient tumours development and is a promising therapeutic target.\"]",

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 22 patients were analyzed by flow cytometry to identify immune cell activation before and after DC vaccines. The ratio of vaccine/baseline frequencies (V/B ratio) was correlated with the survival of each patient.

We treated mice 9 days after intracranial implantation of GL261 cells with intraperitoneal injections of TMZ (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (control mice) for 5 days. Mice were sacrificed at different time points and tumor and peripheral blood harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Using eFluxx-ID multidrug resistance (MDR) assay based on specific inhibitors, we also demonstrated that Abcc3 was functionally active during TMZ treatment. NK cell resistance to chemotherapy was accompanied by an increase in migration and homing ability into the brain at early time point and in cytotoxicity at later phases (beyond the end of TMZ treatment).Our data show that murine NK cells are resistant to and activated by TMZ chemotherapy.

        "Background":"['The genomic landscape of glial tumors is complex, and the identification of effective targeted treatments has proven challenging. To find potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, we analyzed the spectrum of genomic alterations in over 700 confirmed glial tumors. Extracted DNA was subjected to hybrid capture for 236 cancer-related genes plus 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer, and sequenced to a median depth of >500x. Resultant sequences were assessed for base substitutions, insertions and deletions, copy number changes, and select rearrangements. Glioblastomas showed frequent alterations in CDKN2A/B (55%), TP53 (40%), PTEN (40%), and EGFR (40%), including EGFRviii (18.6%). Anaplastic astrocytomas harbored frequent alterations in TP53 (65%), IDH1 (55%), and ATRX (51%). Astrocytomas, including both low grade and mixed grade tumors, had a similar genomic landscape to that of anaplastic astrocytomas with frequent alterations in TP53 (53%), IDH1 (45%), and ATRX (36%). In addition to known fusions involving EGFR, FGFR3, and BRAF, we also identified rare, but therapeutically relevant, fusions involving ROS1 and PDGFRA that have been reported exclusively in lung cancer and hypereosinophilic syndrome, respectively. Unsupervised clustering of all glial tumors based on genomic alterations identified six distinct classes each driven by unique combinations of genomic events. Tumors driven by concurrent alterations in IDH1, ATRX, and TP53 were associated with younger age and anaplastic astrocytoma histology (p = 2.21016). The addition of NF1 alterations to IDH1, ATRX, and TP53 mutations was modestly enriched in glioblastoma samples (p = 0.04). Other classes showed distinct drivers (MAPK or PI3K pathway alterations) coupled with unique mechanisms of cell cycle deregulation (CDKN2A/B loss, CDK4/MDM2 amplification, or RB1 alterations). The potential clinical importance of these genomic findings was demonstrated in three patients with surgically confirmed recurrent glioblastoma who received molecularly-matched targeted inhibitors as part of second-line therapy. Patients with activation of EGFR via amplification or mutation (R108K), activation of the mTOR pathway via inactivation of NF1, and constitutive activity of BRAF (V600E) were treated with erlotinib, everolimus, and vemurafenib, respectively, administered in combination with chemotherapy. In all three cases, imaging responses and overall survival were deemed far greater than expected by the treating physician. In conclusion, complex genomic data from glial tumors can be grouped into distinct sub-classes driven by unique combinations of alterations. Anecdotal clinical data suggest that subsets of patients may benefit from molecularly matched targeted therapies; larger studies investigating the efficacy of these agents in selected patients are warranted.']",

        "Background":"[\"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary tumor of the CNS and carries a dismal prognosis. The aggressive invasion of GBM cells into the surrounding normal brain makes complete resection impossible, significantly increases resistance to the standard therapy regimen, and virtually assures tumor recurrence. Median survival for newly diagnosed GBM is 14.6 months and declines to 8 months for patients with recurrent GBM. New therapeutic strategies that target the molecular drivers of invasion are required for improved clinical outcome. We have demonstrated that TROY (TNFRSF19), a member of the TNFR super-family, plays an important role in GBM invasion and resistance. TROY expression increases with glial tumor grade and inversely correlates with patient survival. TROY stimulates GBM cell invasion and increases resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation treatment. Conversely, knockdown of TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in an intracranial xenograft model. Propentofylline (PPF), an atypical synthetic methylxanthine compound, has been extensively studied in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia where it has demonstrated blood-brain permeability and minimal adverse side effects. In this study, we demonstrated that PPF decreases TROY protein expression in glioma cells, and subsequently suppress activation downstream signaling effectors including AKT, NF-B, and Rac1. PPF treatment of glioma cells also suppressed glioma cell migration and invasion, demonstrated by transwell migration assay and reduced membrane ruffling. Finally, PPF treatment increased vulnerability of glioma cells to Temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation. In summary, this study demonstrates that PPF provides a pharmacologic approach to target TROY to inhibit glioma cell invasion and reduce therapeutic resistance to TMZ and radiation.\"]",

For brain and brain tumor PK of letrozole, rats with and without orthotopic implantation of C6 glioma received letrozole (4 - 12 mg/kg; i.v. andor oral). Dual probe intracerebral microdialysis was performed to determine the unbound extracellular fluid (ECF) letrozole concentrations. Serial ECF and blood samples were simultaneously collected over 8 hrs. PET/CT imaging was performed using 18F FDG to evaluate changes in active tumor volumes pre- and post-treatment of letrozole. Brain tissues were collected at the end of the experiment for histological evaluations.All glioma cell lines included in this study expressed CYP19 and letrozole exerted marked cytotoxicity against these cells ( IC50s 0.1 - 3.5 M). The relative brain distribution coefficients, measured as the ratio of the observed AUC in ECF and AUC of unbound letrozole in plasma (AUCecf/AUCp,ub) ranged from 0.31 - 0.98. Furthermore, the tumoral ECF levels of letrozole was 1.5 - 2 fold higher relative to tumor-free region of the brain, resulting in tumoral ECF Cmax values that were 10 and 35-fold higher than the observed IC50 value of 0.1 M against C6 gliomas cells in culture. PET/CT imaging showed a marked reduction of active tumor volume (75-90%) after 8-10 days of letrozole treatment (N=7).

Identification and characterization of the GBM-promoting factors is imperative for the development of novel and effective clinical interventions. We recently discovered that the expression of B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), a gene involved in the development of B cell lymphoma, is up-regulated in GBM. This study aims to explore the functional implications of BCL6 in this disease.MethodsWe analysed the transcriptional level of BCL6 in primary glioma samples, and screened the protein expression in a panel of human GBM cell lines as well as primary GBM explants. cDNA microarray analysis was conducted to identify the potential downstream targets of BCL6 in GBM. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA), small hairpin RNA (shRNA), and CRISPR-mediated gene silencing strategies were applied to examine the biological function of BCL6. Finally, inhibitors targeting BCL6 were tested in glioma cells.ResultsIn silico analysis revealed elevated BCL6 mRNA levels in both primary GBM samples and cell lines when compared with neural stem cell or non-tumor brain tissues. Western blot confirmed the prevalent expression of BCL6 in GBM cell lines as well as primary GBM explants. Functional studies showed that BCL6 played an important role in promoting cell growth. Depletion of endogenous BCL6 through siRNA, shRNA or CRISPR in GBM cells led to marked inhibition of cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.Transcriptome analysis showed that BCL6 is an important regulator of TP53 signaling pathway. Knockdown of BCL6 increased the expression of p53, p21CIP and p27KIP. CHIP-qPCR further confirmed that BCL6 interacted directly to the TP53 promoter and suppressed its expression.Moreover, BCL6 negatively regulated MEK-ERK activation in GBM cells. BCL6 depletion reduced the phosphorylation levels of both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, but had little effect on AKT phosphorylation. Our further investigations uncovered that BCL6 modulated the expression of several key regulators of MEK-ERK pathway, such as SPRY1, SPRY2 and AXL. Finally, BCL6 inhibitor showed marked anti-proliferation activity in GBM cells, suggesting that targeting BCL6 may serve as a new strategy to treat GBM.ConclusionOur data suggest that BCL6 is involved in glioma tumorigenesis through regulating both the TP53 and MEK-ERK pathways, and that BCL6 is a potential therapeutic target for glioma treatment.']",

For those dying within 5 years, MMSE scores were stable initially, while B-QOL scores decreased; both declined rapidly in the last year of life and similarly between arms. In the aggregate, scores decreased over time (P=0.0413 for MMSE; P=0.0016 for B-QOL) and were superior with age < 50 years (P<0.001 for MMSE; P=0.0554 for B-QOL) and KPS 80-100 (P<0.001). Younger age and higher KPS were associated with longer survival. After adjusting for patient factors and drop-out, survival was longer after PCV+RT (HR=0.66, 95% CI=0.49-0.9, P=0.0084; HR=0.74, 95% CI=0.54-1.01, P=0.0592) in models with MMSE and B-QOL. There were no differences in MMSE and B-QOL scores between arms (P=0.4752 and P=0.2767, respectively); higher scores predicted longer survival. Conclusions', ' MMSE and B-QOL scores held steady in both arms for survivors. For those who died, B-QOL scores declined slowly until the last year of life, then rapidly. Younger, fitter patients had better MMSE and B-QOL scores and longer survival.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma represents the deadliest of all skin cancers being responsible for more than 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Although the results with BRAF inhibitors have been very promising, practically all of the patients treated thus far have developed resistance to these drugs. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of malignancies, including melanoma. However, there are no reports on the activation of this pathway in the setting of vemurafenib-resistance. Herein, we first identified that melanoma cell lines, with acquired in vitro-induced vemurafenib resistance, showed increased levels of Hh pathway component genes glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 and 2 (GLI1/GLI2) compared to nave cells. We also observed these findings in melanoma samples from patients. Moreover, the increased expression of the transcription factors GLI1/GLI2 was independent of canonical Hh signaling and was instead correlated with non-canonical Hh signaling, involving TGF/SMAD signaling. Knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 restored the vemurafenib-resistant cells to sensitivity, an effect associated with both growth arrest and senescence. Treatment of vemurafenib-resistant cells with the GLI1/GLI2 inhibitor Gant61 led to decreased invasion of the melanoma cells in a 3D skin reconstruct model and was associated with a decrease in metalloproteinase (MMP2/MMP9) expression and microphtalmia transcription factor (MITF) upregulation. Our findings also demonstrated that GLI1/GLI2 modulation could be a useful strategy to prevent drug resistance. Alternating pre-treatment with vemurafenib and Gant61 significantly reduced IC50 of subsequent vemurafenib treatment in nave melanoma cells, demonstrating a promising approach for the control of vemurafenib-resistance in patients with unresectable melanoma. The modulation of vemurafenib chemosensitivity was triggered by GLI1/GLI2 repression during the acquisition of resistance, which did not occur in the treatment protocols with only vemurafenib continuously or in alternate days. The alternating treatment regimen with vemurafenib and Gant61 was able to suppress GLI expression, delaying or decreasing vemurafenib resistance. Taken together, our data demonstrated an unprecedented mechanism of vemurafenib resistance by GLI1/GLI2 upregulation, shedding light on the development of Hh pathway inhibitors as a promising strategy for melanoma treatment.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma (GB) is the highest grade and most common form of primary adult brain tumors. Despite surgical removal followed by concomitant radiation and chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), GB tumors develop treatment resistance and recur, invading brain tissue. Impaired response to treatment occurs rapidly conferring a median survival of just fifteen months. Thus, it is necessary to identify the genetic and signaling mechanisms that promote tumor resistance and spread in order to develop targeted therapies to combat this refractory setting. Our lab has previously published a role for the TWEAK-Fn14 ligand-receptor system in GB cell invasiveness and survival. Here we report that SGEF, a RhoG specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is overexpressed in GB tumors and we hypothesize that SGEF plays an important role in promoting TWEAK-Fn14 mediated glioma invasion and survival. We show that upon TWEAK binding to Fn14, SGEF is recruited to the Fn14 cytoplasmic tail. The Fn14-SGEF interaction requires TRAF2 recruitment and leads to activation of Rac1. Importantly, SGEF mRNA expression is elevated in TMZ-resistant primary GB tumor grafts compared to those with known TMZ sensitivity. SGEF mRNA and protein expression are regulated by the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling axis in an NF-B dependent manner and inhibition of SGEF expression via shRNA shutdown sensitizes glioma cells to TMZ-induced apoptosis and impairs colony formation following TMZ insult. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of SGEF depleted GB cells revealed impaired expression of a network of DNA repair and survival genes including ATM, ATR, BRCA2, and XIAP among others, as well as increased expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BAD. Understanding the role of SGEF in promoting chemotherapeutic resistance may direct the development of novel targeted therapeutics for TMZ refractory, invasive GB cells.']",

        "Background":"['There is an urgent need for the design and discovery of new and potent inhibitors for the DNA repair protein MGMT (O6-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase) in glioma therapy. MGMT is highly expressed in brain tumors, and plays a primary role in conferring resistance to alkylating agents. The psuedosubstrates for MGMT such as the O6-benzylguanine have not been successful in the clinic due to prolonged inhibition of DNA repair in the bone marrow stem cells. Recently, we showed that the anti-alcoholism drug, disulfiram (DSF) inhibits MGMT activity in the same way as ALDH by conjugating with the active-site cysteine 145 (Carcinogenesis 35, 692, 2014). DSF, a symmetrical molecule, is metabolized and split in half to yield dithiocarbamate residues. Since the dithiocarbamates resulting from DSF decomposition are the ultimate reactive species that inactivate the aldehyde dehydrogenase and other signaling targets, we surmised that dithiocarbamate derivatives by themselves will be active as MGMT inhibitors and exert anticancer activities. Therefore, we tested various dithiocarbamates (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC); diethyldithiocarbamate (EDTC); dimethyldithiocarbamate (MDTC) and dibenzyldithiocarbamate (BDTC) on MGMT activity, protein levels, and other redox-sensitive proteins such as the NF-B and GSTP1. The cytotoxicity of these dithiocarbamates against the MGMT-proficient SF-188 glioblastoma cells was comparable with that of DSF, with the MDTC being most effective and the benzyl derivative BDTC least potent. Western blot analysis in HT29 and SF-188 cells revealed a concentration-dependent degradation of MGMT by the dithiocarbamates, similar to DSF. All dithiocarbamates except the BDTC were superior to DSF in degrading MGMT protein. MDTC was the most potent followed by PDTC and EDTC in depleting the MGMT protein from tumor cells. Further, MDTC was also effective in reducing the cellular levels of NF-B protein. We also established that MDTC binds to the active site cysteine145 in MGMT leading to its inactivation. Currently, we have developed the pegylated PLGA nanoparticles loaded with MDTC or zinc-chelated MDTC to target the glioblastoma and other cancers. The efficacy of these formulations in intracranial glioma models developed in nude mice is being evaluated. The lack of cytotoxicity and inability to bind with MGMT by BDTC suggests that the bulky group attached to the dithiocarbamate may hinder interaction with target proteins or interfere with their metabolism. Since MDTC has a good potential to cross the blood brain-barrier, possess reactive thiol groups that can interact with not only MGMT but also numerous signaling proteins, our strategy using this repurposed compound holds promise in glioma treatment (supported by grants from CPRIT [RP130266] and Carson-Leslie Foundation to KSS).']",

        "Background":"['Ependymoma account for 6-12% of pediatric brain tumors and have a mean age of diagnosis of 4 years, a 5-year survival rate ranging from 39%-64%, and a progression free survival rate of 23-45%. General use of chemotherapeutics remains highly ineffective for this disease therefore standard of care consists of surgery followed by radiation with total gross resection (TGR) having the best outcome (60-89% 5-year overall survival for TGR vs. 21-46% 5-year overall survival for subtotal resection (STR)) [6]. Patients having had STR have an extremely high incidence of disease reoccurrence (43% to 72%) requiring additional surgeries and radiation with a median 2-year overall survival after relapse ranging from 20% to 49% [7]. These statistics highlight the need for better adjuvant therapies. In an effort to identify new targets for treating ependymoma we have developed a mouse model that relies on the intracranial implantation of mouse supratentorial (forebrain) embryonic neuronal stem cells (STeNSC) overexpressing the tyrosine kinase receptor ephrin B2 (EphB2). Tumors develop within 4-8 months post-implantation, require receptor activation and are consistently found to be histologically, ultrastructurally and molecularly similar to the human disease.Given the requirement for EphB2 activation in tumor development, it became necessary to identify the EphB2 initiated signaling pathways involved in this process. Among the many pathways initiated by EphB2 activation are those of the small GTPases of the Ras family (H-Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras) that regulate cellular processes including cell proliferation and transformation. Receptor activation is a multistep process involving receptor autophosphorylation of two critical tyrosines positions 604 and 610 within the juxtamembrane (Y604, Y610), receptor/ligand complex dimerization, release of juxtamembrane mediated kinase domain inhibition and finally kinase domain phosphorylation and activation. While EphB2-mediated activation of Ras involves the kinase domain of the receptor, Ras inhibition (RasGTP conversion to RasGDP) is achieved by activating the Ras GTPase activating protein p120RasGAP via its juxtamembrane. We took advantage of a previously identified EphB2 juxtamembrane mutation that inhibits p120RasGAP activation by converting the tyrosines at positions 604 and 610 to glutamic acids (Y604/610E) thus rendering Ras constitutively active. Ligand-mediated activation of this mutant resulted in an absence of p120RasGAP activation and an increase in Ras signaling (elevated levels of phosphorylated C-Raf, MEK1/2 and Erk1/2) in vitro as predicted. More importantly, overexpression of the EphB2(Y604/610E) protein in our model system showed no change in tumor penetrance (100% penetrance); however, there was a dramatic shortening of tumor latency from 207 days with EphB2 to 40 days with the Y604/610E mutation, supporting the role for Ras signaling in EphB2 mediated transformation.']",

For this assay a single cell suspension of tumor cells is seeded using a cell sedimentation manifold (CSM), precisely into the center of Teflon-masked, ECM-coated slide wells. The adherent tumor cells establish a focal, circular monolayer from which horizontal motility can be microscopically-viewed and photographed over time. We adapted use of the CSM to evaluate the in vitro mobility of non-adherent effector T cells on confluent tumor cell monolayers or on ECM extracts from them. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) sensitized to the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) on 13-06-MG glioma cells or on brain-tropic breast MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells were generated by one-way mixed lymphocyte tumor cell reactions. These alloresponsive CTL were then transduced with retroviral replicating vectors (RRV) coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP). Using the CSM, the RRV-GFP transduced CTL were seeded into the center of wells with a confluent monolayer of glioma cells that were partially HLA matched to 13-06-MG. By light and fluorescence microscopy, we visualized not only the a) mobility of individual GFP+ T cells, but b) the cytotoxicity engendered to the underlying adherent glioma cell monolayer by the overlaid nonadherent CTL, in addition to c) transfer of RRV from the CTL to tumor cells. The in vitro cytotoxic functionality of the RRV-transduced CTL was confirmed by real-time xCELLigence impedance cytotoxicity assays. In other experiments, the RRV-GFP transduced CTL were also stained with a vital fluorescent red dye, CMPTX, to distinguish transduced from nontransduced CTL. The CTL were placed into the center of wells coated with ECM harvested from MDA-MB-231BR cells and radial movement of the transduced and nontransduced CTL was also observed over 72 hr time. We conclude that effector T cells transduced with RRV maintain mobility and cytotoxic functionality, and further, are capable of transmitting RRV to tumor cells. Thus, transduced alloresponsive CTL can facilitate immunogene therapy by their capability of gene delivery to infiltrating tumor cells in the brain.']",

        "Background":"['Malignant gliomas are one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of cancer and can affect any age group. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), infiltration of primary tumor cells into the normal tissue and dispersal throughout the brain is a central challenge to successful treatment that remains unmet. Patients with malignant gliomas respond poorly to the standard therapeutic regimen of radiotherapy and chemotherapy that follow tumor resection and have only a 16-month median survival. It is therefore imperative to identify new approaches to specifically attack GBM cell survival, proliferation and invasion. The cellular mechanisms driving GBM-mediated migration and invasion are not fully understood. RSK2 (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2) is a kinase that regulates proliferation and adhesion and can promote metastasis. We find that RSK2 is significantly upregulated in vivo in human GBM patient tumors, and that high RSK2 expression significantly correlates with advanced tumor stage and poor patient survival. We demonstrate that active RSK2 regulates GBM adhesion and is essential for cell motility and invasion of patient-derived GBM neurospheres. Importantly, inhibition of RSK2 by either RSK inhibitors or shRNA silencing impairs invasion and combining RSK2 inhibitors with temozolomide improves efficacy in vitro. We further show that the effects of RSK2 on GBM invasion are mediated in part through activation of Rho GTPases. Rho family of GTPases are key regulators of cell polarity, migration and invasion. Here, we identify Rho A, B and C as downstream effectors of (RSK2) in GBM cell migration and invasion. Here, we identified a unique signaling pathway in which RSK2 confers invasiveness through leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG)-dependent Rho GTPase activation. RSK2 directly interacts with LARG and nucleotide-bound Rho isoforms, but not Rac1 and Cdc42. Our data support a fundamental importance of residue of Thr577 to the invasive signaling of RSK2. The invasive signaling of RSK2 appears to depend on RhoA and B, but not RhoC. RSK2 activates RhoA through activation of LARG by phosphorylation at Ser1288. Intriguingly, LARG activity is only required for RSK2-T577E, but not RSK2-Y707A-mediated RhoA activation and cell invasion. This further supports a pivotal role of Thr577 in invasive RSK2 signaling. These results establish a unique RSK2-dependent LARG-Rho signaling cascade as an uncompensated factor key to GBM cell migration and invasion. Together, our data provide strong evidence that RSK inhibitors could enhance the effectiveness of existing GBM treatment, and support RSK2 targeting as a promising approach for novel GBM therapy.']",

TLRs signaling pathway activates inflammatory transcription factors, mainly Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRF3/7). Due to their importance in inflammatory process, TLRs are research hot targets for therapy in several diseases, including cancer. This study aims to analyze TLRs (1, 2, 4 and 6) expressions in human diffusely infiltrative astrocytomas, WHO grades II to IV of malignancy (AGII-AGIV), and correlate their expressions among them and with the clinical outcome of AGIV (glioblastoma, GBM) patients. TLRs mRNA levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR in 143 astrocytoma samples and 22 non-neoplastic (NN) brain specimens from epilepsy surgery. Upregulated mRNA levels of all studied TLRs were observed in astrocytomas compared to NN cases (p<0.05), except for TLR2 in AGII. TLR1 and TLR2 median expression values increased according to astrocytoma malignancy. TLRs mRNA expressions presented positive correlation with significance (p<0.05) in all grades of astrocytoma, except for TLR2 and TLR4 in AGIII. Strong associations (r<0.7) were detected with TLR1-TLR2 mRNA expressions among AGII, AGIII and AGIV, TLR1-TLR4 in AGIII, and TLR6-TLR1 in AGII. In GBM patients, TLR2 upregulation was associated to better outcome with longer overall survival (p<0.007). The same was verified for concomitant upregulation of TLR1, 2 and 4 (p<0.05). Aiming to analyze the distribution of these receptors in different cells present in the tumor, we performed immunofluorescence staining of GBM cell lines (A172 and U87MG). All TLRs were detected in both cell lines, indicating that their expression were not limited to immune cells. The current literature has described controversial roles for the TLRs in cancer, either activating an anti-inflammatory condition leading to tumor progression or a pro-inflammatory state leading to tumor abrogation. TLRs distribution among different cells in the tumor environment might be relevant for the inflammatory process. Our findings of TLRs on tumor cells may suggest a tendency towards an anti-inflammatory state. The comprehension of TLRs role in each cell type, that compose the tumor, may help to determine the signaling pathways involved in diffusely infiltrative astrocytoma progression, and potential new therapeutic strategies.']",

        "Background":"['A large body of clinical evidence indicates that abnormal coagulation occurs in a variety of cancers, especially invasive cancers. If cancer clusters erode adjacent normal or tumor vessels, hemorrhage may occur, and fibrin clots immediately form in situ to stop the bleeding. The fibrin clots are subsequently replaced by collagen, similar to the case in the normal wound healing process. Although there are many points in common between cancer-induced stroma and normal wound healing, the critical difference between the two is that the pathophysiological condition in cancer lasts for as long as cancer cells survive in the body (Adv Drug Deliv Rev 2012).First, we successfully developed a mAb that reacts only with human insoluble fibrin, not human fibrinogen (Cancer Sci 2011). In contrast to previously reported anti-fibrin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), our anti-fibrin clot mAb (clone 102-10) recognizes an unexplored hole that is uncovered only when a fibrin clot forms. The epitope of the 102-10 mAb was mapped to a hydrophobic region on the B-chain that interacted closely with a counterpart region on the -chain in the soluble state. New anti-B and anti- mAbs specific for peptides lining the discovered hole appeared to bind exclusively to fibrin clots. Analysis of the kinetics of fibrin clot deposition using 102-10 in several disease models indicated that fibrin clot formation occurs only in the acute phase of the disease process, thrombosis, inflammation or trauma, and that these clots virtually disappear within a few weeks to be substituted by collagen. Then, we developed a new PET probe using 102-10. The radiolabelled mAb was injected into mice bearing chemically induced spontaneous tumors, and the probe showed clear and specific accumulation in the tumors. We named this detection strategy cancer stromal targeting (CAST) diagnois. Immunohistochemistry using this mAb revealed higher fibrin deposition in WHO grade 4 gliomas than in lower-grade gliomas. Because erosive tumors are highly likely to show micro-hemorrhages, even early asymptomatic tumors detected with radiolabeled 102-10 mAb may be aggressively malignant (Sci. Rep. 2013).In conclusion, CAST diagnosis and therapy based on anti-insoluble fibrin mAb may be a useful new strategy in the field of oncology.']",

Defining tumor boundary during surgery remains challenging. Fluorescent dyes such as 5- Aminolevulinic acid, have been studied as aids for tumor delineation but have failed to gain widespread acceptance in clinical practice. It has long been known that a substantial number of cancers, including Glioblastoma, exhibit a hyperpolarization of the plasma and mitochondrial membrane potential.

IB expression is an independent predictor of patient prognosis in multiple glioblastoma populations. Glioblastomas with initially high IB expression significantly repress IB upon tumor recurrence, suggesting an acquired mechanism to evade its tumor-suppressive and/or chemo-sensitizing effects during tumor progression. Conclusions', ' IB is a molecular determinant of biological tumor behavior and patient survival in glioblastoma multiforme. Deletion of NFKBIA could present an alternate mechanism to activate EGFR signaling in EGFR non-amplified glioblastomas.']",

Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gene fusions exist across a multitude of tumor types and that known fusions are not always confined to the disease in which they appear most often.

Activation of Fn14 signaling by TWEAK binding triggers glioma cell invasion and survival and therefore represents an attractive pathway for therapeutic intervention. Based on structural studies of the TWEAK-binding cysteine rich domain of Fn14, several homology models of TWEAK were built to investigate plausible modes of TWEAK-Fn14 interaction. Two promising models, centered on different anchoring residues of TWEAK [Tyrosine 176 (Y176) and Tryptophan 231 (W231)], were prioritized using a data-driven strategy. Site-directed mutagenesis of TWEAK at Y176, but not W231, resulted in the loss of TWEAK binding to Fn14 substantiating Y176 as the anchoring residue. Importantly, mutation of TWEAK at Y176 did not disrupt TWEAK trimerization, but failed to induce Fn14 mediated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) signaling. The validated structural models were utilized in a virtual screen to design a targeted library of small molecules predicted to disrupt the TWEAK-Fn14 interaction. 129 small molecules were screened iteratively, with identification of molecules producing up to 37% inhibition of TWEAK-Fn14 binding. One specific compound, L524-0366 binds specifically to the Fn14 receptor and disrupt TWEAK-Fn14 interaction. Treatment of L524-0366 suppresses TWEAK-induced cell migration and survival in glioblastoma cells. In summary, we present a data-driven in silico study revealing key structural elements of the TWEAK-Fn14 interaction, followed by experimental validation, serving as a guide for the design of small molecule inhibitors of the TWEAK-Fn14 ligand-receptor interaction.

        "Background":"['IntroductionTumor cells growing in the brain are resistant to chemotherapy. We have recently demonstrated that the activation of the endothelin receptors A and B axis is involved in the induction of resistance to chemotherapy by primary brain tumor cells and by brain metastases. Treatment with a dual endothelin receptor antagonist in combination with chemotherapy produced significant therapy of orthotopically growing glioblastoma cells as well as breast cancer and lung cancer brain metastases. Since the milieu of tumors in the brain is hypoxic (0.5% - 1% O2), we investigated whether the chemo-resistance of the tumor cells is linked to hypoxia mediated activation of the endothelin receptor axis.Materials and Methods Human glioma (LN229), breast cancer (MDA231), and lung adenocarcinoma (PC14) cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. The endothelin receptor A (ETAR) and/or B (ETBR) of cancer cells were knocked down by shRNA. ETAR and ETBR were activated by incubating the tumor cells with exogenous endothelin-1 for 15 minutes or blocked by treating the parental or engineered cells with ETAR-specific antagonist, BQ123 (100nM), and/or ETBR-specific antagonist, BQ788 (100nM), for 2 hours prior to the addition of paclitaxel (5ng/ml), temozolomide (100g/ml) or cisplatinum (5g/ml). The cultures were placed into incubators with an atmosphere of 20%, 6% or 1% oxygen for 48 hours(MDA231 cells) or 72 hours (LN229 and PC14 cells). Tumor cells were then plated into 96-well plates to determine chemosensitivity by the MTT assay or into 6-well plates for western blots, or into chamber slides for immunohistochemical analyses. Expression of survival-related proteins such as pETAR, pETBR, pAkt, pMAPK, pNFB, GSTA5, TWIST1 or Bcl2L1, were then determined.Results Stimulation of parental MDA-231, PC-14, or LN229 cells with exogenous ET-1 induced significant resistance against all tested chemotherapeutic agents. The resistance was abolished only when both the ETAR and ETBR were antagonized by a combination of BQ123 and BQ788. Parental cells cultured under hypoxia were also significantly resistant to chemotherapy and treatment of these cells with BQ123 and BQ788 reversed this resistance. The effects of exogenous ET-1 on the induction of chemo-resistance or BQ123 and BQ788 on restoration of chemo-sensitivity were not found in any cancer cells devoid of ETAR and ETBR. In all cases, the chemo-resistance of tumor cells was associated with increased level of expression of proteins related to cell survival.Conclusion These data suggest that the endothelin receptor axis plays a role in hypoxia induced resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Additional studies are warranted to determine the functional changes of the endothelin receptor axis in hypoxia.']",

Although recurrences are generally believed to be from the same clone as the initial tumor, very little is understood about the mechanism of PCNSL recurrences. Recognizing patterns of recurrence is key for early detection and may provide valuable insight into potential recurrence mechanisms and guide therapies to extend CR duration. Methods', ' IRB approval was obtained to retrospectively review patients with CD20+ PCNSL treated with high dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) based chemotherapy after blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD). Patients with measurable disease at presentation who progressed after CR were included. Pattern and location of first recurrence were identified. Results', ' 128 patients were treated with HD-MTX/BBBD, 75 attained CR, 40 subsequently progressed and met inclusion criteria. At recurrence, new enhancement was noted in a spatially distinct site in 34 of 40 (85%). Only 6/40 (15%) of recurrences were contiguous to the initial lesion. Conclusions', ' Our results suggest that unlike gliomas, the majority of PCNSL recur at spatially distinct anatomical locations within, and in few cases outside, the CNS. Recurrence distal from the site of initial disease after CR suggests that seeding from potentially dormant CNS, ocular or systemic lesions may play a significant role. Muldoon et al (2011) previously described occult CNS disease outside the enhancing lesions in animal models, while Jahnke et al (2006) demonstrated persistent systemic monoclonal B-cells in blood and bone marrow of patients in CR.

TMZ is known to induce senescence3,4 and III-tubulin knockdown significantly increased TMZ-induced senescence in U87 (III-tub siRNA', ' 84.12.6%, p<0.05, compared to ctrl siRNA', ' 58.17.1%) and U87vIII (III-tub siRNA', ' 83.94.5%, p<0.01, compared to ctrl siRNA', ' 56.34.3%) cells. Further validation using a 3D-growth model of primary human GBM neurospheres, showed that neurosphere formation was significantly reduced (30.7%, p<0.01) upon III-tubulin knockdown compared to ctrl siRNA.Conclusions', ' Our data strongly suggests that aberrant expression of III-tubulin in glioblastoma may play an important role in intrinsic drug sensitivity to broad classes of chemotherapy drugs. Targeting III-tubulin increases temozolomide sensitivity by enhancing drug-induced apoptosis and senescence.

        "Background":"['Innovative biotherapeutic approaches for experimental malignant gliomas (MGs) and brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) include using oncolytic viruses such as Myxoma Virus (Myxv) or immune cells such as Natural Killer (NK) cells. In this study, we combined the individual strengths of using NK cells and Myxv to treat MGs with a view of overcoming the potential limitations posed when each is used as monotherapy. All MGs (U87, U251) and BTSCs (25EF and 48EF) investigated expressed varying levels of NK ligands including inhibitory MHC-I, activating ULBP1-3, MICA/B, and co-activating nectin-2, poliovirus receptor. Infection of MGs and BTSCs with Myxv resulted in the downregulation of MHC-I expression both on the cell surface and intracellularly. No effect was observed on the expression of NK activating ligands except for the downregulation of nectin-2. The downregulation of MHC-I and nectin-2 by Myxv was specifically mediated by M153 gene of Myxv as loss of M153 restored MHC-I and nectin-2 expression. Subsequently, NK cell degranulation and killing of MGs was enhanced in Myxv-infected cells. Loss of M153 inhibited NK degranulation and lysis of MGs. In vivo, using luciferase-expressing U87 cells in a mouse intracranial model, Myxv accelerated tumor size reduction/clearance by NK cell lysis. Combined intratumoral treatment with Myxv and NK of established U87 tumor accelerated tumor clearance when compared with single treatment with Myxv or NK. Tumor in 66% of mice (4 out of 6 mice) were cleared or significantly reduced within 14 days following combination treatment with Myxv and NK. No significant effect was observed in Myxv or NK singly-treated mice within the same time frame. Clearance of tumors was only first observed in 50% (2 out of 4) of Myxv-treated mice after 25 days Myxv treatment. In NK treated mice, the tumor size rather increased. The enhanced tumor clearance in the combined Myxv and NK treated mice was possibly due to the down-regulation of MHC-I by Myxv since combined treatment with NK cells and mutant Myxv (gene M153 which is responsible for MHC-I down-regulation was deleted) did not result in clearance of tumors.']",

        "Background":"['TCRP-1 (Tongue Cancer Resistance-related Protein-1) gene was recently cloned from the multidrug resistance tongue cancer cell (Tca8113/PYM) which developed by ourselves team (GeneBank accession number', ' EF36480). Subsequently we found that the gene can mediate tongue cancer cells to specific cisplatin chemotherapy tolerance and radiotherapy tolerance, and its mechanism may be caused at least in part by TCRP1 induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-B signaling pathway and promotes cell survival. Recently, using real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical method to detect various types of tumors and control normal tissue, we found that expression of TCRP1 in lung cancer, ovarian cancer and glioma were significantly higher than that of normal tissue. These results suggest that TCRP1 gene may be closely related to the carcinogenesis. In the present study we constructed a lentiviral vector expressing TCRP1 to transfect NIH/3T3 cells, and found proliferation rate of NIH/3T3/TCRP1 cells was significantly improved compared with NIH/3T3 cells and NIH/3T3/vector cells by detection with the CellTiter-Glo Assay. Clonogenic capacity of NIH/3T3/TCRP1 cells was 5.39 times and 20.18 times higher than the control group in plate cloning and soft agar cloning assay. Subcutaneous tumorigenicity experiment with self-controlled in 10 nude mice found only the injected site of NIH/3T3/TCRP1 cell emergence nodular masses about 1cm diameter after 3 weeks, and the tumorigenic rate was 90%. Pathological diagnosis of mass was fibrosarcoma. These results suggest that TCRP1 gene own an oncogene-like effect. In order to study the TCRP1 tumorigenic mechanisms, gene chips were used and showed that expression of total of 1894 genes were up-regulated and 3626 genes were down-regulated. Among these genes, the verification results of PDPK1, Akt, GSK3 and cyclinD1 were consistent with microarray results. Co-immunoprecipitation assay indicate that TCRP1 interact with PDPK1; FRET(Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer)experiments shows that TCRP1 can directly bind to PDPK1. On the other hand, the growth rate and in vitro colony forming ability of NIH/3T3/TCRP1 cells was significantly inhibited after using PDPK1 inhibitor AR-12 and TCRP1 interference. These data suggest that TCRP1 mediated PI3K/Akt pathway to the excessive activation by recruiting recruitment and activating of PDPK1, resulting in a series of growth and proliferation and cell transformation related factor expression or activation of its downstream. This may be the possible mechanism of cell malignant transformation induced by TCRP1.{This study was supported by grant from National Natural Science Foundation (81472184) of China.}']",

        "Background":"['The receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 is predominantly expressed in the endothelium but has also been identified on primitive hematopoietic stem cells, monocyte and macrophage subclasses, as well as on glioma or hematological tumor cells. Based on its expression in many patient-derived leukemic blasts inhibition of the Tie2 pathway may provide an attractive opportunity for therapeutic intervention in leukemias.In this study we report the pharmacological profile of a novel, highly potent and orally available Tie2 inhibitor (BAY-Tie2). The discovery and design process leading to BAY-Tie2 was performed with the goal of sparing other angiogenic RTKs, such as VEGFRs, FGFRs or PDGFRs. BAY-Tie2 is based on a novel imidazopyrazole core, combined with a SF5-substituted phenyl ring that fills the deep DFG-out pocket. BAY-Tie2 binds to Tie2 with a Kd value of 1.6 nM and is selective against VEGFR2 (Kd of 1600 nM), FGFR1 (<30% inhibition at 1 M), FGFR2/3/4 (<10% inhibition at 1 M) and PDGFR/ (<30% inhibition at 100 nM). BAY-Tie2 potently inhibits Tie2 autophosphorylation in recombinant CHO-Tie2 and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with IC50 values of 0.7 and 1.3 nM. Consistently, BAY-Tie2 was shown to inhibit Tie2 phosphorylation in vivo by analyzing angiopoietin-1 induced Tie2 phosphorylation status in extracts of murine lungs from BAY-Tie2-treated mice.In subcutaneous xenograft models of highly angiogenic tumors, BAY-Tie2 reduced tumor growth and showed evidence for potential combination benefit with anti-VEGF therapy. In order to explore the potential of a Tie2 inhibitor beyond affecting angiogenesis, we established disseminated leukemia models, using Tie2-expressing cell lines, such as the CML cell lines MEG-01 and EM-2. Both cell lines engrafted predominantly in bone marrow and spleen. Treatment started 3 days after i.v. cell implantation with either BAY-Tie2 or cytarabine and was well tolerated. Efficacy was monitored by a) inhibition of disease progression, b) weekly fluorescence-based in vivo imaging (IVI) using an Alexa750-labeled anti-human CD33 antibody, and c) q-RT-PCR specific for BCR-ABL and hCD45 in murine peripheral blood. BAY-Tie2 inhibited disease progression comparable to cytarabine. Tumor load measured by IVI was reduced in BAY-Tie2 treated groups by 45% in the MEG-01 and by 65% in the EM-2 model compared with the untreated control, very similar to the cytotoxic treatment with cytarabine. Quantitative RT-PCR on peripheral blood revealed that BAY-Tie2 and cytarabine delayed the appearance of circulating tumor cells in both CML models.These data demonstrate that BAY-Tie2 is an orally active Tie2 inhibitor that may have therapeutic benefit not only in angiogenic tumors but also in hematological, Tie2-expressing malignancies.']",

        "Background":"['With the advent of immune therapies including inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis there is an urgent need to identify cancer patients that benefit from these therapies and to overcome mechanisms of resistance. Here, we analyzed the impact of tumor genetics on the composition of tumor microenvironment across 21 solid cancer types from the TCGA project. Using specific mRNA markers of 10 cell populations (MCPcounter), we estimated the content of T cells, CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, B lineage cells, NK cells, monocytic lineage cells, myeloid dendritic cells, neutrophils, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in tumor tissues. Immune cell compositions were correlated with mutational load, the activity of 27 mutational signatures (MutSigs) and PD-L1 mRNA expression. Correlation strength was assessed using Spearman’s rho statistics. Multiple testing was addressed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and FDR control at 5%. MutSig 1 (clock-like, age-related) showed significant positive correlations with immune cell infiltrations in low-grade gliomas, negative correlations in breast cancer, melanoma, stomach cancer, lung and prostate adenocarcinoma, but no significant correlations in the remaining 15 cancer types. Of the two APOBEC-related signatures, MutSig 2 showed positive significant correlations with immune cell infiltrates in cervical cancer, bladder cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, head and neck cancer and thyroid cancer, MutSig 13 in breast and cervical cancer. In particular, correlation of MutSig 2 with cytotoxic lymphocytes was significant in cervical cancer, bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (R = 0.29, R= 0.17 and R = 0.17), the corresponding correlation of MutSig 13 in breast cancer (R = 0.17). MutSig 4 (tobacco smoke-related) showed a positive significant correlation with CD8+ T cells and NK cells in lung adenocarcinoma (R = 0.15 and R = 0.14). In contrast, correlation of MutSig 4 with immune cell infiltrates was non-significant or negative in head and neck cancer. In colorectal cancer, MutSig 6 (defective mismatch repair) showed significant positive correlations with NK cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, monocytic lineage cells and neutrophils infiltration (R = 0.45, R = 0.37, R = 0.23 and R = 0.19). PD-L1 mRNA expression and immune cell infiltrates correlated positively in all 21 cancer types. In particular, correlation with monocytic lineage cells was positive and significant in all cancer types and strong (R > 0.50) in 12 cancer types. Correlation with T cells was positive and significant in 18 cancer types and strong in 10 cancer types. In summary, pan-cancer analysis of DNA and RNAseq data showed that specific mutational signatures contribute to cancer cell immunogenicity, while the ubiquitous clock-like mutational process did not positively correlate with immune cell infiltrates in 20 of 21 cancer types. Moreover, PD-L1 mRNA expression strongly correlated with infiltrates of immune cells in the majority of cancer types.']",

        "Background":"['The role of the nervous system in adult tumor progression has been hypothesized. In contrast, the involvement of nervous system in childhood cancer is still unknown but it results of particular interest. The main objective of this study is to identify whether mutations in neuron signaling proteins are present in pediatric cancer. Additionally this study foresees to determine the effect of mutation on the protein structure and function and to elucidate if differences between solid and hematopoietic pediatric tumors exist in terms of neural signaling. The genomic data of pediatric cancers available in the Pediatric Cancer Data Portal (PeCan) were mined looking for point mutations in the genes of interest. The analysis comprised a set of well recognized neuron signaling factors including 50 neurotrophic growth factors, 23 axon guidance molecules and 47 neurotransmitter receptors. Missense mutations were retrieved per gene and tumor type. The effect of each mutation on the protein function was predicted through BioMuta, a well curated and annotated database. Our results showed the existence of genetic mutations in neuron signals across 16 childhood tumor types. Neuroblastoma (NBL) was the most mutated solid tumor with a total of 26 mutated genes out of 120 study genes. B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (BALL) was the most frequently mutated hematopoietic malignancy resulting with 17 mutated genes out of 120 study genes. EGFR was the most mutated gene within the group of neurotrophic molecules, with 14 missense mutations across 6 different tumor types. A total of 8 out of 14 mutations reported in EGFR were classified as damaging mutated phenotype and these were present in NBL, glioma, BALL and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). EPHA3, ROBO3, RBP1, and PLXNB1 were the most frequently mutated genes within the group of axon guidance molecules, with 3 missense mutations each one across 7 tumor types, most of them categorized as damaging mutations. GRIN2B was the most frequently mutated gene within the group of neurotransmitter receptors with 3 missense mutations including one damaging mutation found in NBL. A number of damaging mutations here identified corresponded to “Gain of function” mutations such as the T790M EGFR driver mutant present in pediatric AML. The genetic mutations here compiled on neurosignaling molecules may increase the response of tumor cells to neurotransmitters, axon guidance molecules and neurotrophic factors that ultimately may boost their growth and metastatic capacity. Our data show that neurotrophic factors as well as axon guidance molecules and neurotransmitter receptors are structurally and functionally altered in childhood cancer patients, both in hematopoietic and solid tumors. The influence of nervous system in the tumorigenesis and cancer progression may have a relevant role thus raising important implications for future therapies for childhood cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Ewing Sarcoma (ES) is a rare malignant round-cell tumor growing in bone or soft tissue that occurs in childhood or early adulthood. Patients with ES have a high rate of tumor recurrence and poor prognosis, highlighting the urgent need for new therapies. About 95% of ES harbor a t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation, resulting in an in-frame gene fusion between the EWSR1 gene (chr.22) and one of the ETS family genes, mainly FLI1 (chr.11). Recent studies show that EWS-FLI1 is an oncoprotein that plays a central role in ES tumor initiation and development. Given the specificity and critical role of EWS-FLI1 in ES tumorigenesis, identification of new compounds that bind EWS-FLI1 is of great significance for the development of new therapeutic approaches for ES. Unfortunately, the rational design and screening of EWS-FLI1- targeting small molecules has been hampered due to the poor solubility of the protein in vitro and limited structural information.Here we report the results of a small molecule screening aimed at identifying molecules cytotoxic to ES cells, but not to glioma or non-tumoral control cells. In this screening, we identified a class of sulfonamides that consistently yielded ES cell inhibitors. KCN1, the lead compound, significantly decreased viability of ES cells but not control cells in vitro, as demonstrated by sulforhodamine B and clonogenicity assays. KCN1 blocked progression through the cell cycle and triggered apoptosis in ES cells. Expression profiling revealed that KCN1 prominently upregulated expression of genes coding for enzymes of the mevalonate (cholesterol synthesis) pathway, suggesting metabolic reprogramming. Further, intraperitoneal administration of KCN1 (60 mg/kg) in ethanol/cremophor formulation 5 times/week inhibited the growth of ES cells in vivo in a nu/nu mouse model, while being very well tolerated without any overt toxicity. To identify the molecular target of KCN1, we used an affinity purification approach with a KCN1-biotin probe on cell extracts. Following mass spectrometry, we identified that KCN1 interacts directly with EWS and EWS-FLI1, suggesting binding to EWS N-terminus. ES cell treatment with KCN1 is accompanied by downregulation of EWS-FLI1 transcriptional targets (NR0B1, cyclin D1, GLI1) and further characterization of its mechanisms is ongoing.In summary, we identified arylsulfonamides as a novel class of agents with anti-ES activity. We are the first to report identification of a small chemical molecule inhibitor directly interacting with the N-terminus of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein (first-in-class). KCN1 inhibits the growth of ES cells in vitro and in vivo. Considering the lack of targeted therapies and the apparent non-toxic nature of KCN1, our data warrant further preclinical and clinical testing of KCN1 and other molecules in the arylsulfonamide class for treating ES as well as further study of their precise mechanism of action.Citation Format', ' Stefan Kaluz, Shaoman Yin, Sarojini N.
