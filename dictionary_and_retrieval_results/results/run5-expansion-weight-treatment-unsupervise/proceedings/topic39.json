        "Background":"['Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) represents a category of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas characterized by marked cellular pleomorphism, and expression of CD30. Two systemic forms of ALCL are defined by the presence or absence of chromosomal translocations involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23 locus. Among several pathways triggered by ALK signaling, it has been widely shown that the constitutive activation of STAT3 is strictly required for ALK-mediated transformation and survival.To discover essential mediators of STAT3 oncogenic activity that may represent feasible targets for ALCL therapies, we performed gene and miRNA expression profiling experiments in association with functional validation approaches. The transcriptome of STAT3 was analysed in ALK positive ALCL cell lines using a tightly controlled time course experimental condition, in which the STAT3 signalling was abrogated by an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA).Gene expression profiling analysis identified a selected number of genes (1730) specifically modulated by STAT3 silencing. A significant overrepresentation of putative STAT3 binding sites was found in regulatory regions of early down-regulated genes. Functional studies using a shRNA lentiviral library established that Interferon Regulatory Factor-4 (IRF4) targeting specifically affect cell viability of ALK+ ALCL cells. In contrast, forced expression of IRF4 partially rescued STAT3 knock-down sustaining the survival of ALK+ cells.In a parallel experiment, genome-wide miRNA expression profiling identified 48 miRNAs concordantly modulated by the inducible knock down of ALK and STAT3. Among these, we demonstrated that expression of miR-1792 cluster significantly reverted STAT3 deprivation, sustaining both proliferation and survival of ALCL cells.In conclusion, genes and miRNA expression profiling associated to functional screenings allowed the identification of new biologically relevant targets for ALK+ALCL. We speculate that IRF4 and miR-1792 cluster are involved in the lymphomagenesis of STAT3+ ALCL, and that their inhibition might represent an alternative avenue to interfere with ALK signaling in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas.']",

        "Background":"['ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)-positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) occurs predominantly in children and young adults. Their chemotherapeutic treatment leads to a 5-year overall survival amounted to 70-80%. The tumor relapses are often very aggressive and lethal and their underlying mechanisms are unknown. Therefore, there is still a need to improve current therapy. Crizotinib is the most advanced ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor already used in clinics for ALK-associated lung cancers. However, mechanisms of escape to crizotinib have been reported in cell lines and patients submitted to continuous crizotinib treatment. Thus, its use in frontline treatment for ALCL is hampered by the emergence of resistance. As autophagy has been proposed as a cell survival mechanism potentially involved in the acquisition of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor, we investigated here whether autophagy was activated during ALCL treatment. We demonstrated in ALCL that autophagy is induced upon ALK inactivation, as a pro-survival response. We found that different ALK inhibition approaches (crizotinib or ALK-targeting siRNA) combined with autophagy inhibition (chloroquine, 3-methyladenine or ATG7-targeting siRNA) compromised cell survival and cell growth. Altogether, our results suggest that crizotinib and chloroquine (two drugs already used in clinics) co-treatment could be beneficial for ALK-positive ALCL patients.']",

It may be sub-divided into cases with or without translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK), leading to overexpression of ALK. While the outcome for patients with ALK positive ALCL - particularly in pediatric patients - has been very favorable following doxorubicin-based therapy, ALK negative cases have fared more poorly. Approaches such as autologous transplantation have been studied in this group in an attempt to improve outcome (dAmore et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012).   Methods', '    23 patients with newly diagnosed ALK positive (15) and ALK negative (8) ALCL underwent treatment with 6 to 8 cycles of dose-adjusted infusional etoposide, vincristine and doxorubicin with prednisone and cyclophosphamide (DA-EPOCH). Both groups had similar IPI characteristics (shown below).   Results', '    19/23 (83%) patients achieved CR or CRu; 3/23 (13%) a PR and 1 patients had PD. At the median potential follow-up time of 13 years, event free survival (EFS) in ALK positive and ALK negative ALCL was 72% and 62.5% (p = 0.50) and overall survival was 76% and 87.5% (p = 0.82), respectively. Toxicity was assessed on all 135 cycles. Neutropenic fever and thrombocytopenia < 25,000/mm3 occurred on 10% of cycles, respectively.

The characteristics of ALCL, such as ALK expression and EBV coinfection, in individuals with HIV infection have not been adequately evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate these features in HIV-associated ALCL cases. Methods', ' A MEDLINE search for all cases of HIV-associated non-cutaneous ALCL was undertaken. Data regarding patient age, gender, HIV status (CD4 count, viral load, opportunistic infections), HAART, lymphoma features (B symptoms, stage, sites of involvement, immunophenotype, ALK expression, molecular studies), EBV coinfection, therapy and outcome (survival, cause of death) were extracted and analyzed.

Many (78%) patients had stage IV disease and B symptoms were reported in 9 cases (50%). T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was present in all cases, CD30 was positive in 22 (96%), and the vast majority (90%) were ALK-negative. EBV was identified in 8 (35%) cases.

Conclusions', ' HIV-associated non-cutaneous ALCL appears to affect younger individuals and is associated with EBV infection in a subset of cases. Apart from marked immunosuppression, the poor prognosis of HIV-associated ALCL appears to be related to the absence of ALK expression, advanced stage at presentation with prominent extranodal disease, inadequate therapy including HAART, and poor response to CHOP.

        "Background":"['Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive CD30+ T-Cell lymphoma that accounts for 2-8% and 10-15% non-Hodgkin lymphomas in adults and children, respectively. The currently used standard therapy for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK, a member of insulin receptor superfamily) positive ALCL has limited effectiveness, resulting in a substantial percentage of cases with poor outcome, either failing to enter remission or relapsing within a few months after starting the treatment. Thus, there is a clear unmet clinical need for developing novel, effective and safer therapeutic strategies for ALCL. Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is a nucleolar phosphoprotein, which functions as a molecular chaperone for proteins and nucleic acids. Approximately 50% of ALCL cases are positive for the NPM-ALK fusion chimera generated by the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation. The oligomerization domain of NPM1 in the fusion protein NPM-ALK, mediates the ligand-independent dimerization of chimeric protein, which results in constitutive activation of the chimeric tyrosine kinase activity leading to downstream signaling pathways responsible for the oncogenicity. Ceritinib is a second generation FDA approved ALK inhibitor for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Here we report the first preclinical evaluation of ceritinib growth inhibitory effects on ALK-positive ALCL cells. The NPM-ALK expressing ALCL model cell line SUDHL-1 used in our studies. Treatment with ceritinib significantly induced apoptosis dose dependently (10-50nM) in ALCL cells associated with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Mechanistically, ceritinib blocked phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream signaling effectors STAT3, AKT and ERK1/2. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that ceritinib induced G0/G1 arrest with concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases which was associated with decreased cyclin D1 and increased p21 expression. ALCL is also characterized by strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 (a member of the TNF receptor family). CD30 stimulation leads to NF-kB activation and the induction of anti-apoptotic mechanisms. In response to ceritinib treatment, flow cytometry data showed that reduced CD30 expression in a dose dependent manner. Altogether, these pre-clinical results demonstrate that ceritinib induces apoptosis in ALCL cells by inhibiting ALK downstream signaling cascade and support the rational for in vivo testing of ceritinib for the treatment of ALK positive lymphomas.']",

The combined effect of everolimus and crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor, has not yet been investigated in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). We treated ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, K-299 and SU-DHL-1, with various concentrations of everolimus and crizotinib at a fixed ratio of 1', '40 (0.5 nM, 1.0 nM, and 2.0 nM for everolimus, and 20 nM, 40 nM, and 80 nM for crizotinib, respectively). After 72 hours, the combination index (CI) values were less than 1 (0.596, 0.583, and 0.763 in K-299 cells, and 0.326, 0.616, and 0.271 in SU-DHL-1 cells, respectively) in all tested combinations, suggesting synergistic cytotoxicity of everolimus and crizotinib. Western blot analysis demonstrated that everolimus up-regulated phosphorylation of ERK Thr202/Tyr204 and AKT Thr308 and Ser473. However, this aberrant activation of ERK and AKT was attenuated by the addition of crizotinib. In addition, while everolimus selectively inhibited mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation, a marker for mTORC1 activity, the combination treatment more potently inhibited mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation and decreased mTOR Ser2481 phosphorylation, a marker for mTORC2, as well. Cell-cycle analysis showed that the combination treatment induced G1 arrest. PARP cleavage was also increased after the combination treatment. To test the hypothesis that our findings could be applyed to other ALK-positive malignancies, we treated NCI-H2228, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that harbors an EML4-ALK fusion gene, with everolimus and crizotinib for 72 hours. The CI values were less than 1 in all tested combinations', ' 0.228 in 1 nM everolimus plus 80 nM crizotinib, 0.216 in 2 nM everolimus plus 160 nM crizotinib, and 0.349 in 4 nM everolimus and 320 nM crizotinib. In summary, everolimus in combination with crizotinib synergistically inhibited the growth of ALK-positive ALCL cells. Crizotinib abrogated aberrant ERK and AKT activation induced by everolimus and more potently inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity when combined with everolimus, resulting in increased G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our findings may provide an evidence for future research using everolimus and crizotinib combination in ALK-positive ALCL and could be used to improve the therapeutic outcome in patients with ALK-positive ALCL.']",

It has been shown that about 70-80% of ALK+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) cases, an aggressive Non Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma, are characterized by the traslocation t(2;5), originating the functional, aberrant oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK. Crizotinib was the first clinically relevant ALK inhibitor, now approved for the treatment of late stage and metastatic cases of lung cancer. Several patients soon developed Crizotinib resistance, mainly due to the appearance of new point mutations located in ALK kinase domain. Currently, other ALK inhibitors are available and already in clinical trial, hopefully representing the second line therapy able to overcome Crizotinib resistance. In this work we focused our attention on the more potent phase I/II dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113 (Ariad Pharm.), able to overcome the Crizotinib-resistant gatekeeper mutation L1196M. Two NPM-ALK+ human cell lines, KARPAS-299 and SUP-M2, were grown in four independent flasks in the presence of increasing doses of AP26113, so that eight cell lines able to grow in the presence of high AP26113 doses were selected. All cell lines show an AP26113 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value substantially higher than the one observed in parental cells, with a 130 to 1000-fold increase. All KARPAS-299 populations resistant to AP26113 show NPM-ALK overexpression, due to oncogene amplification, as the main cause of resistance, while SUP-M2 cells proliferating in the presence of the drug harbour several point mutations spanning the entire ALK kinase domain. In particular, we identified the following aminoacid substitutions', ' L1122V, , L1196M, S1206C and a double F1174V+L1198F mutation.

Lack of representative cell lines and/or models has compromised the development of successful therapy.Toward this end, we report the generation and characterization of a group of novel ALCL tumor grafts. We implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) tumor tissue fragments, fresh or viable cryopreserved, from 11 cases of primary systemic ALCL (3 ALK+ and 8 ALK-) in six- to eight-week old severe immunocombined immunodeficiency NOD Cg-Prkdcscid/Il2rgtm1wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. A single leukaemic ALCL sample was injected i.v. or s.c.Six cases led to successful lymphoma growth within 6-12 weeks as subcutaneous solid spheroid masses constituted by a uniform population of large pleomorphic cells CD30-positive. All tumor grafts were re-implanted in recipient animals, in same cases up to 21 consecutive implants with an analogous time growth rate. Two cases, in the same way of the original human neoplasia, were early associated with concomitant enlargement of multiple organs. All tumor graft lines eventually showed disseminate disease with involvement of distant lymph nodes and of spleen (with homig in peri-arteriolar spaces), liver (initially observed within the sinusoidal spaces) and kidney. The morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation (expression of CD30, cytotoxic proteins and ALK) of the serially propagated ALCL tumor grafts demonstrated a high concordance between primary and derived animal tumors which showed highly stable profile along different passages from the early generation (T1) until the final ones (up to T16). The clonal relationship with primary and corresponding tumor grafts was confirmed by gene TCR rearrangement analyses and by ALK FISH studies.In addition we interrogated the model using gene expression profiling and single nucleotide polymorphism which established a close relationship among primary and derived tumors. Massive parallel sequencing on mRNA transcripts defines the presence of two novel chimeras involving NF1-MAZ and TRAF1-ALK1, which confirmes the evidence of ALK signaling and pinpoint a role of RAS in ALK- ALCL.The tumor grafts displayed, also, therapeutic responses with conventional therapy (CHOP) which reflected that seen in the donor patients', ' initial partial responses followed invariably by clinical relapses. To overcome this refractory we assayed the sensitivity of two tumorgraft lines, generated from ALK+ ALCL, to a new selective ALK inhibitor (CEP28122) that led a rapid and stable response.

The ongoing therapies in ALK+ ALCL, based on aggressive chemotherapy, are not optimal. One compound so far, the crizotinib, is used in clinics for the treatment of ALK-dependent lung cancers. However, the first mutations conferring resistance to crizotinib, have been reported and hampered its use for the treatment of ALK+ ALCL. Thus, despite the therapeutic success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer treatments, acquired drug resistances universally develop. In this context, cytoprotective autophagy has been proposed as the next target for elimination of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We recently demonstrated that cytoprotective autophagy is indeed activated shortly upon ALK inactivation in ALCL and that its inhibition enhances the anti-tumoral action of Crizotinib. A transcriptome analysis showed an increased expression of many genes from the autophagy machinery such as ULK1, MAP1LC3B, or ATG16L2 after crizotinib treatment in ALCL. Moreover, new preliminary results enabled us to identify a set of miRNAs differentially expressed in ALCL upon Crizotinib treatment. As miRNAs are known as fine regulators of gene expression, we anticipate that some of them could be efficient regulators of core autophagy genes expression. The aim of our study is to select a few miRNAs of interest and to confirm their regulatory role on the autophagic machinery.

Recently, high-level expression of CSF1R on malignant cells in ALCL has been linked to shorter progression free survival, providing a rationale to test adoptive C28-mediated T-cell therapy. This approach encompasses the genetic modification of T-cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) named C28, a fusion receptor coupling the recognition of CSF1R on the tumour cell surface to the delivery of tailored T-cell activation signal provided by a fused CD28+CD3 endodomain. To optimize this approach for human translation, the C28 CAR was co-expressed with the chimeric cytokine receptor 4 (combination termed C4), which allows for selective expansion and enrichment of CAR-transduced T-cells using IL-4. PBMCs of healthy donors were isolated and activated using anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Following retroviral T-cell transduction and 14 days expansion of C4+ T-cells in the presence of IL-4, co-cultures with a panel of ALCL cell lines (2 ALK positive and 2 ALK negative ALCL cell lines) were set up to test C4 efficacy in vitro. Successful re-targeting of C4+ T-cells was confirmed by monitoring target cell destruction. Conditioned media was collected and analysed for IFN- and IL-2 production. Cytotoxicity, cytokine release and T-cell proliferation data demonstrated Ag-specific activation of the C4+ cells, which contrasted with T-cells expressing a control CAR with truncated endodomain.

Depending on the presence or absence of chromosomal translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK gene and hence the expression of ALK, ALCL is further subdivided into ALK positive (ALK+) or ALK negative (ALK-) types. NPM-ALK chimeric fusion oncogenic protein is found in around 80% of ALK+ ALCL, as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35). The current standard of treatment for ALK+ ALCL is combination chemotherapy. Crizotinib, an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the only agent available to target NPM-ALK in ALCL. The identification of other targeting agents would potentially improve the treatment outcome of ALK+ ALCL especially for relapsed and/or refractory cases. In this study, we investigated the effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on NPM-ALK in ALCL.MethodsWe treated ALK+ ALCL cell lines with various clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3 (0, 0.5, 1 and 2M) for 24 hours and examined its effects on NPM-ALK mRNA expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by Western immunoblotting. The downstream signaling pathway of NPM-ALK, phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705, was also examined. Next, we analyzed apoptotic cell death and growth arrest induced by As2O3 in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL cell lines using Annexin V-7AAD staining and cell cycle analysis. The effect of As2O3 on cell viability was also measured with WST-1 assay.RESULTSOur data showed that As2O3 downregulated NPM-ALK at the protein level without affecting the transcription. It also inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 in all ALK+ ALCL cell lines. We also found that blocking protein degradation through proteasome with MG132 abrogated the effect of As2O3 on NPM-ALK. Furthermore, As2O3 induced apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and growth inhibition in ALK+ but not in ALK- ALCL cell lines, with a GI50 of less than 1M, which was a level achievable with clinical use of As2O3.CONCLUSIONS.Our data demonstrated that As2O3 downregulated NPM-ALK by facilitating protein degradation through the proteasomal pathway, thereby inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in ALK+ ALCL.

Furthermore, the activity profile of ASP3026, crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, AP26113 and PF-06463922 against a panel of 20 NPM/ALK drug-resistant mutants will be presented. We report for each ALKi the IC50 value against the mutants, the IC50 fold increase over wild-type NPM/ALK (relative resistance, RR) and the IC50 ratio between parental Ba/F3 cells and mutants (therapeutic index, TI). From our screen, the G1202R and C1156F/D1203N mutations appear to be highly resistant to all tested inhibitors, therefore they are predicted to be the most challenging mutants for ALKi therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Activated Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is seen in several cancers, including 2-7% of non-small cell lung cancer and  70% of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). The most common ALK fusion in ALCL is a translocation, t(2;5)(p23;35), placing the kinase domain of ALK before the constitutively active promoter of nucleophosmin (NPM). Activated ALK drives oncogenesis by turning on multiple proliferative pathways. The success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in ALK+ lung cancer has prompted evaluation of their use in ALK+ ALCL as a therapeutic strategy for patients who fail combination chemotherapy. Clinical studies in lung cancer show resistance to these drugs limits progression-free survival. We aim to identify resistance mechanisms against approved TKIs, crizotinib and ceritinib, in ALK+ ALCL.We selected for resistance in 3 patient-derived cell lines through propagation in gradually increasing drug concentrations. We assessed resistant subclones with long-insert whole-genome sequencing, viability and proliferation assays, qPCR and western blots. Similar profiling was carried out upon drug withdrawal. We validated our findings in cytokine-dependent murine pro-B cells transformed with NPM-ALK during ceritinib incubation. We xenografted resistant clones to SCID mice and assessed tumour burden over time.Resistant clones showed viability stimulation by TKIs and when washed out of drug, these clones underwent apoptosis due to hyper-stimulation of ALK signalling. Genomic amplification of NPM-ALK was seen leading to an increased expression at the mRNA and protein levels. TKI-dependence therefore was co-selected with resistance, showing for the first time toxicity to cancer cells due to an overdose of ALK signalling. We validated our findings in IL3-dependent FL/5.12 cells, which also showed co-selection for drug resistance and dependence due to ALK over-expression. Resistant ALCL lines selected for ability to grow without TKI behaved similarly to parent lines, showing no stimulation of viability in presence of drug. ALK mRNA and protein also return to baseline in these cells. SCID mice injected with resistant cells required TKI treatment for tumour engraftment and tumour burden decreased when drug dosing was stopped. When tumours re-grew, drug treatment was reinitiated, generating a second response demonstrating in vivo that NPM-ALK up-regulation results in both resistance and dependence on the TKI and resistant cells die from an overdose of ALK signalling in the absence of drug.Our results reveal that up-regulation of the fusion-ALK drug target is a resistance mechanism, previously un-reported in any ALK+ cancers. Up-regulation of NPM-ALK provides cells means to acquire resistance but also results in ALK overdose when drug is withdrawn, revealing intermittent dosing as a potential therapeutic strategy to prolong tumour control in ALK + patients.']",

        "Background":"['Recently, over 80 cases of anaplastic large-cell kinase (ALK)-negative, T-cell, anaplastic, non-Hodgkin lymphomas (T-ALCL) have been identified worldwide in patients with textured saline and silicone breast implants. These breast implant-associated T-ALCL cases are striking for their homogeneous clinical presentation and pathology that is distinct from established classes of ALCL. In order to understand the nature of this newly emerged clinical entity, we have established three new cell lines, designated T cell Breast Lymphoma (TLBR) -1, -2, and -3, from patient primary tumor biopsy specimens. Characterization of these pre-clinical models confirmed fidelity to the original tumor biopsy specimens and highlighted unique features that may aid the development of effective treatments for these cancers. Gene expression analysis demonstrated significant up-regulation of survivin and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes (BID, BAK, BBC3) by all TLBR cell lines relative to healthy donor T cells. This preliminary finding prompted examination of upstream regulators of cell survival in T cells, namely the interleukin signaling associated with the JAK/STAT pathway. TLBR cell lines were found to secrete high levels of IL-6 and IL-10, and were strongly positive for the cognate receptors. The TLBR cell lines also showed elevated levels of STAT3 and pSTAT3 by immunoblotting techniques, along with a simultaneous reduction in expression of the pSTAT3 phosphatase, SHP-1. These results implicate an unregulated autocrine STAT3 pathway present in the TLBR cell lines that strongly contributes to their tumorigenesis. Assays of various inhibitors of this pathway support this hypothesis since targeting of STAT3 with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sunitinib, led to dramatic in vitro cell death in all TLBR cell lines. More specific inhibition of STAT3 with S3I-201 had comparable results with Sunitinib. Furthermore, IL-6 neutralization by a monoclonal antibody or SHP-1 restoration by 5-azacytidine treatment also demonstrated moderate efficacy in inhibiting TLBR cell line growth in vitro. These discoveries strongly suggest the use of these reagents in the clinical treatment of Breast Implant Associated T-ALCL. The TLBR cell lines closely resemble the primary breast implant-associated lymphomas from which they were derived, and as such provide valuable preclinical models to study the unique biology and provide clinicians with improved knowledge for treatment and diagnosis.']",

        "Background":"[\"Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, a member of the insulin receptor family, with a tightly controlled expression pattern. Deregulated ALK expression has been linked to the development of several types of cancers. Typically, chromosomal translocations involving ALK generate constitutively expressed chimeric oncoproteins, such as NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and EML4-ALK in non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, activating mutations in ALK, and increased copy number that result in aberrant gene expression, have also been observed in neuroblastoma and colorectal cancers. Based on the above observations, several small molecule ALK inhibitors have been developed and are in clinical trials for a variety of tumors expressing this kinase. This has resulted in the use of crizotinib for the treatment of EML4-ALK + lung cancers.Recently several large scale immunohistochemistry and genome sequencing studies of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) revealed aberrant ALK expression. It was found that ALK mRNA expression was significantly different in alveolar (ARMS) and embryonic RMS (ERMS), the two major histological subtypes in children. Thus, ALK expression might play a role in tumorigenesis for this disease, and this kinase may represent a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of RMS. To answer this question we analyzed ALK expression in a large panel of RMS cell lines, and pediatric tumor samples by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. We also compared the sensitivity of these cells to a series of ALK inhibitors. Our results indicate that the majority of ARMS cell lines demonstrated significantly higher ALK mRNA expression as compared to ERMS, and to normal human myoblast control cells. This was confirmed by western analysis. Growth inhibition assays confirmed that all RMS lines were more sensitive to crizotinib and LDK-378 than control lines, consistent with the hypothesis that ALK is a driver of cell growth in these tumors.Based on our in vitro analysis, we suggest that ALK inhibition may represent an effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of ALK+ RMS. Preclinical studies to confirm or disprove this hypothesis are currently underway.Supported by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities\"]",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases. A number of recurrent leukemogenic gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and clinically validated in AML. However, nearly 50% of AML patient samples lack any known AML driver mutations. Advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of novel and actionable gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements in these AML samples. The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene is one such rearrangement identified in samples from patients with AML. Fusion of ETV6 sequences to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 results in constitutive activation of the TRKC kinase and ETV6-NTRK3 expression has emerged as one of the key oncodrivers for leukemogenesis. Constitutive activation of TRK family tyrosine kinases has also been detected in a wide range solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, highly potent and selective kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency against TRKA/B/C, ROS1 and ALK kinase activities (encoded by NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively). In these studies, we have demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib in AML cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and survival in vitro with sub-nanomolar EC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein as well as phosphorylation of known TRKC downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Sensitivity to entrectinib was dependent on expression of the TRKC fusion protein. In xenograft models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression, which was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. The clinical relevance of activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements has been validated by the efficacy of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with NTRK rearranged acute myeloid leukemias and provide rationale for the clinical development of entrectinib in molecularly defined hematologic malignancies. Entrectinib is currently the subject of an ongoing global Phase 2 basket study enrolling patients across multiple tumor histologies containing TRK, ROS1 or ALK fusions.']",

Gene expression profiling in mantle cell lymphoma [MCL] have shown the Auroras are over-expressed and is a poor prognostic marker within the proliferative signature. PTCL (NOS) are a heterogeneous group of rare non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) derived from activated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. PTCL and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) both of T-cell phenotype and ALK negative have an aggressive clinical course with an inferior event free and overall survival relative to B-cell NHL counterparts. The biological explanation for the difference is unknown. Patients with PTCL have a poor prognosis due to a very aggressive disease course coupled to a lack of effective therapies. Therefore, the development of novel and effective treatments based on biologically validated targets is urgently needed for this disease. We hypothesized and investigated that (1). Auroras are over-expressed in human PTCL-NOS, (2). Aurora ATP-site small molecule inhibitor (SMI) is effective in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in cell culture and (3). Aurora SMI will be safe and effective in treating patients with relapsed aggressive T-cell NHL in early phase clinical trials.

All pts received CHOP  etoposide (E) every 2 or 3 weeks; in pts <=60 yrs C, H, and E were escalated to further improve outcomes. Results', ' The majority of pts with ALK-positive ALCL presented with IPI 0, 1 (62%) or IPI 2 (26%) and had an excellent overall survival (OS) of 89 % and event-free survival (EFS) of 75% at 3 yrs.

Only ALK translocations, which define ALK-positive anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL), have emerged as a genetic biomarker predicting favorable outcome following conventional chemotherapy (e.g. CHOP). Using next-generation sequencing, we discovered additional recurrent chromosomal translocations in PTCLs involving either the DUSP22 locus on 6p25.3 or TP63 on 3q28. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic utility of combined testing for both these events in PTCL patients.Methods', ' We examined the clinicopathologic features of 134 systemic PTCLs using WHO criteria, including 49 ALCLs, 23 angioimmunoblastic PTCLs, 50 PTCLs of not otherwise specified type, and 12 PTCLs of other subtypes. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine ALK expression, an established surrogate for ALK translocations in ALCL. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to detect translocations of DUSP22 or TP63 in all cases. OS was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons were made using the log-rank test.Results', ' There were 83 males and 51 females, with a mean age of 58 years (range, 6 to 90 years). Median OS for all patients was 22 months (5-year OS, 36%) with a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 0.1 to 354 months). Translocations of DUSP22, TP63, and ALK were mutually exclusive. Patients with ALK-positive ALCL (n=17) had a median OS of 176 months (median follow-up, 68 months; 5-year OS, 69%). Despite being ALK-negative, cases with translocations of DUSP22 or TP63 shared pathologic features with ALCL. Median OS was not reached in patients with DUSP22 translocations (n=7; median follow-up, 88 months; 5-year OS, 100%). Patients with tumors harboring TP63 translocations (n=9) had a median OS of 13 months (all dead at 76 months; 5-year OS, 11%). Patients with none of these abnormalities (n=101) had a median OS of 17 months (median follow-up, 13 months; 5-year OS, 29%). Differences in OS among these groups were highly significant (p=0.0002).Conclusions', ' PTCLs with DUSP22 translocations had a favorable prognosis similar to ALK-positive ALCLs. In contrast, TP63 were associated with very poor prognosis. FISH for these biomarkers is a promising tool for risk stratification, particularly since both translocations occurred in cases with overlapping pathologic features. PTCLs with DUSP22 translocations may represent a genetically defined subset of ALK-negative ALCLs. Like patients with ALK-positive ALCLs, these patients may not derive additional benefit from intensified up-front strategies such as early transplantation. Patients with none of these abnormalities comprised 75% of patients studied and had an intermediate prognosis, indicating the need for additional biomarkers in this group to improve risk stratification.']",

Among peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs), little is known about fusion genes except for those involving ALK. Discovery of fusion genes may provide therapeutic targets for PTCLs, which have poor outcomes with conventional therapy. We have developed methods for detecting candidate fusions using (1) mate-pair DNA sequencing (MPseq), an approach that spans the entire genome at a fraction of the cost of traditional whole-genome sequencing, and (2) RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Each technique has strengths, limitations, and false discovery rates. Here, we integrated results of both methods to discover and orthogonally validate expressed fusion genes in PTCLs.Methods', ' DNA and RNA were extracted from 49 frozen, OCT-embedded clinical PTCL specimens, including 25 anaplastic large cell lymphomas; 16 PTCLs, not otherwise specified; and 8 other PTCLs. MPseq and RNAseq were performed using Illumina library protocols and a HiSeq 2000. Detection of fusion genes and transcripts followed our published methods (Blood 2012;120', '2280 and Nucleic Acids Res 2011;39', 'e100, respectively). Functional annotation of genes involved in fusions was performed using DAVID.Results', ' Of 2818 candidate chromosomal rearrangements identified by MPseq and 90 candidate fusion transcripts identified by RNAseq, 45 events were present in both datasets (mean/case, 0.9; range, 0-7). Fusions were inter-chromosomal in 16 and intra-chromosomal in 29. Annotation clusters with the highest enrichment scores related to SH2 domain-containing proteins and tyrosine kinases (including FER and MAP2K3). Seven genes were recurrently involved in fusions, including known fusion partners such as ALK and previously unreported fusion partners such as PPP1R8, a phosphatase inhibitor important for the activity of Polycomb group proteins such as EZH2. Detection of candidate events only by MPseq could be explained in part by breakpoints mapping to non-genic regions (79% of events). Detection only by RNAseq could be explained in part by unannotated transcripts spanning neighboring named genes (median intra-chromosomal distance, 0.09 MB vs. 12.7 MB for intra-chromosomal candidates identified by MPseq; p<0.0001, Wilcoxon test).Conclusions', ' Integrated DNA/RNA sequencing is an effective, clinically feasible tool for simultaneous discovery and orthogonal validation of expressed fusion genes. This approach yielded fusions in PTCLs involving genes with key functions in lymphocytes, including novel and recurrent fusions, some of which might be targetable with compounds currently in clinical trial. Candidate intra-chromosomal fusion transcripts not identified by MPseq may represent unrecognized isoforms or the results of novel read-through mechanisms, and merit further study.']",

Results', '  PTCL subtypes included PTCL-NOS (31%), ALCL (26%), AITL (23%), NKTCL (7%), ATLL (6%) and other (7%). Median age was 62 yrs (18-95), 74% stage III-IV, 29% bone marrow involved, 49% other EN sites, and 55% elevated LDH. IPI and PIT scores were high risk in 41% and 24% of pts, respectively. 23 (7%) pts received only palliative care whereas 318 received chemotherapy', ' CHOP-like regimens (76%, 13% with etoposide), hyperCVAD/MA (7%), or other (16%). 36 pts (11%) underwent SCT in 1st remission (85% autologous). Overall response rate to initial therapy was 73% (61% complete); 24% had primary refractory disease. With 39 months median follow-up, 3-year PFS and OS were 32% and 52%, respectively. On univariate analysis for PFS, improved outcomes were noted for ALK+ ALCL, NKTCL, stage I-II, and normal LDH. Univariate analysis of treatment factors found no benefit for etoposide, but identified improved PFS with XRT or SCT in 1st remission. Univariate analysis showed improved OS for ALCL (ALK+ and ALK-), AITL, stage I-II, XRT, consolidative SCT, and normal LDH. On multivariable analysis, however, only stage I-II retained prognostic significance (PFS', ' HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.34-0.85), P=0.007; OS', ' HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.22-0.78), P=0.006). Notably, the impact of XRT and SCT in 1st remission was no longer seen after adjusting for stage and initial treatment response. Finally, the most dominant factor predicting outcome was response to initial therapy (CR vs PR/SD/PD), including after adjustment for stage and SCT (PFS HR 0.19 (95% CI 0.14-0.28), P<0.0001; OS HR 0.26 (95% CI 0.17-0.40), P<0.0001).   Conclusions', '  This analysis identified early stage disease and initial response as the dominant prognostic factors. The optimal induction regimen for PTCL pts remains uncertain and our analysis found no clear benefit for consolidative SCT.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Prognosis of T/NKCL is poor after standard CHOP therapy. To prospectively evaluate the role of dose intensified chemotherapy, we conducted a phase II trial of HCVIDD/MA in patients with newly diagnosed T/NKCL.   Methods', '  Eligible patients were adults with newly diagnosed untreated T/NKCL excluding ALK positive ALCL. Patients received HCVIDD/MA every 21 days for up to eight cycles. In this trial, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at 25mg/m2was used instead of conventional doxorubicin.  Results', '  Fifty-three patients were enrolled (PTCL-NOS', ' 24, AITL', ' 7, Systemic ALK negative ALCL', ' 7, HSTL', ' 7, extranodal NKCL', ' 5, Others', \" 3). The median age of patients was 54 (range 20-72). Eighty-five percent of the patients were in advanced stage, 32% had bone marrow involvement and 43% had IPI score > 2. The median cycle number of treatment given was five. Only 5 of 53 patients (9%) received seven or more cycles primarily due to prolonged cytopenias. Of 47 patients who were eligible for response evaluation, the overall response rate was 66% with complete response rate of 57%. Six patients (11%) underwent consolidative autologous stem cell transplant at treating physician's discretion. Median progression free survival (PFS) of all patients was 8.1 months. With the median follow-up time of 83 months, five-year PFS and overall survival (OS) rates were 22% and 49%, respectively. The patients with extranodal NKCL had shorter PFS (all 5 progressed < 13 months) than other types. Patients with HSTL had slightly longer PFS (median 49 months) than other types. There was no significant difference in PFS or OS by treatment cycles beyond five and by consolidative ASCT. Grade3/4 anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 66%, 74% and 79%, respectively. Of note, 11 patients (21%) were taken off study due to thrombocytopenia with median of 5 cycles.   Conclusions\", '  HCVIDD/MA for the first line treatment of T/NKCL showed response rate and survival outcome similar to previously reported those with conventional CHOP, and was associated with higher hematologic toxicities.

We characterized the incidence of CNS involvement, risk factors and outcome in a large single institution dataset of PTCL.  Methods', '   Retrospective review of the T-cell lymphoma database at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  We identified 232 patients with any subtype of PTCL between 1994-2011 with a minimum 6 months of follow-up or an event defined as relapse or death.

        "Background":"['Inhibitors of the BET family members BRD2/3/4 are a promising new class of anti-cancer drugs. Here, we assessed the antitumor activity and the mechanism of action of OTX015, a selective orally bioavailable BRD2/3/4 inhibitor, in cells derived from human mature lymphoid neoplasms.OTX015 was evaluated in 31 B-cell malignancies cell lines', ' 13 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), 8 anaplastic large T-cell lymphomas (ALCL), 4 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 3 splenic marginal zone lymphomas (SMZL), and 3 multiple myelomas (MM). Anti-proliferative effect was seen in the majority of the cell lines. The median IC50s, calculated at 72h, were', ' DLBCL, 0.19M (range 0.07-12.68); ALCL, 0.48M (0.04-9.1); SMZL, 0.16M (0.1-0.24); MM, 0.45M (0.06-0.7); MCL, 2M (1.22- >15). There were apparently no IC50 differences based on the cell of origin (DLBCL) or ALK-positivity status (ALCL). Apoptosis did not appear as the main effect of the drug, being not observed in 11 cell lines treated with the IC50 defined by MTT test after 72-hour exposure. However, OTX105 determined a dose-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest in 12/12 cell lines (DLBCL, MM and ALCL), and an increased percentage of senescent cells in 3/3 sensitive cell lines (DLBCL and ALCL).MYC mRNA was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in 4/5 DLBCL, 4/4 ALCL and 2/2 MM cell lines. Down-regulation was usually seen within 1h. Real-time PCR showed that MYC and also NFKB target genes were affected. Gene expression profiling (GEP), using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip array, was done in 3 sensitive DLBCL cell lines, exposed to DMSO or OTX015 (0.5M) for 4h and 8h. MYC was the most down-regulated gene. Functional annotation of the down-regulated genes identified an over-representation of genes involved in RNA and DNA metabolism and cell cycle, putative MYC target genes and transcripts reported as down-regulated after treatment with aminopeptidase inhibitors and HDAC-inhibitors. Up-regulated transcripts were enriched of genes coding for proteins involved in chromatin structure, as well as putative MYC target genes and transcripts reported as up-regulated after treatment with HDAC-inhibitors, demethylating agents or aplidine. Also, GEP signature was similar to what reported for the BRD-inhibitor JQ1.In conclusion, OTX015 showed in vitro anti-tumoral activity in a large series of mature lymphoid neoplasms. The activity was largely cytostatic, with cell cycle G1 arrest and induction of senescence. Down-regulation of MYC and its putative targets appeared as the main effect, but it might not be the only mechanism of action, since a few cell lines did not appear to down-regulate MYC after exposure to OTX015, which also induced down-regulation of NFKB target genes and modulation of transcripts similar to what observed with HDAC-inhibitors. The compound appears worth of further investigation as a new promising therapeutic agent in lymphomas.']",
