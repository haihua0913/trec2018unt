In translocation-associated sarcomas, the presence of the fusion transcript can be detected in peripheral blood by RT-PCR.

Methods', ' We developed a novel method to examine large numbers of peripheral blood cells for the presence of sarcoma-associated genetic changes. Using an IRB-approved biospecimen collection protocol, peripheral blood was collected from 20 patients with translocation-associated sarcomas or well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WD/DD LS), which are characterized by MDM2 amplification. In this exploratory phase, the analysis was limited to patients with high burden of disease, evidence of disease progression or recurrence. Immuno-FISH was performed using CD45 immunostaining to identify hematopoietic cells and the corresponding FISH probe, either a break-apart probe (SYT, DDIT3) or MDM2 probe to detect amplification. Results', ' MDM2-amplified cells were detected in a subset of WD/DD LS peripheral blood samples, while translocation-positive cells were detected in samples of synovial sarcoma (using the SYT breakapart probe) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (using the DDIT3 breakapart probe). Conclusions', ' To our knowledge this is the first report of direct visualization of sarcoma cells in peripheral blood using whole-blood FISH analysis. We are currently characterizing these cells morphologically and immunocytochemically. In addition, we are developing tools necessary to perform quantitative analysis of circulating tumor cell frequencies in peripheral blood samples, to begin to establish whether the levels of circulating tumor cells correlate with tumor burden and response to therapy.

        "Background":"['Curative therapy for childhood sarcoma presents challenges when complete resection is not possible. Ionizing radiation (XRT) is used as a standard modality at diagnosis or recurrence for childhood sarcoma, however local recurrence is still problematic. Most childhood sarcomas are TP53 wild type at diagnosis, and approximately 5-10 per cent have MDM2 amplification or overexpression. Thus, reconstitution of a functional TP53 pathway, through inhibition of MDM2-mediated TP53 degradation, is an attractive anticancer strategy to enhance the activity of cytotoxic therapies that induce apoptosis through TP53-dependent pathways. RG7388, is a second generation MDM2 inhibitor. However, combining MDM2 inhibitors with myelosuppressive therapies may be problematic as the p53-MDM2 auto-regulatory loop in normal megakaryocytopoiesis suggests that thrombocytopenia may be an on-target toxicity. Here we have evaluated the antitumor activity of RG7388 alone or in combination with XRT in two rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts (Rh18 [embryonal], and Rh30 [alveolar]).RG7388 was administered at 80 mg/kg daily x 5 (schedule 1) or 100 mg/kg BID q7 days x 2 (schedule 2). XRT (2 Gy daily fractions) was given to a cumulative dose of 20 Gy (Rh18) or 30 Gy (Rh30). XRT (20 Gy) induced complete regressions of Rh18 xenografts followed by regrowth of all tumors with the median event time of 89.6 days compared 9.5 days for control or RG7388 treated tumors (P = 0.0287). The combination of XRT with RG7388 on either schedule induced complete regressions with no tumor regrowth (19 weeks observation). Thus, RG7388 given on either schedule significantly potentiated XRT (P<0.0003) for both schedules). RG7388 slightly potentiated XRT against Rh30 xenografts where the cumulative tumor volumes at the end of the period of observation (day 134) was significantly smaller for the combination group in Schedule 1 (P = 0.0005) and Schedule 2 (P = 0.0029) when compared with tumors receiving 30 Gy alone. Local XRT-induced skin toxicity was not enhanced by RG7388.Tumor samples were derived from untreated tumors, or tumors following 2, 4 or 6 Gy XRT and 24 and 48 Hr after the last XRT fraction with or without RG7388, or at the same time points from mice treated for 3 days with RG7388 alone (80 mg/kg). RG7388/XRT increased p21 levels over the 3 days of treatment, to a greater extent than XRT alone whereas p21 induction in tumors treated with RG7388 alone was lowest. Both XRT and combination treatments induced PARP cleavage over the first 48 hr.Although additional models should be examined to see whether the synergistic activity of XRT combined with RG7388 occurs frequently, these initial results suggest that the combination may provide more effective local control for pediatric soft tissue sarcoma.']",

Methods', ' We reviewed charts of patients with advanced sarcoma referred to investigational cancer therapeutics department and had CLIA certified comprehensive genomic profiling of 200- 315 cancer genes in at least 50ng of DNA.

Interesting cases included a patient with 3 EWS rearrangements (EWSR1-FLI1, CENPP-EWSR1, ETS1-EWSR1) and re-classification of an unclassified sarcoma to Ewings. Conclusions', ' Incorporating NGS into sarcoma management may allow for more precise diagnosis and sub-classification of this diverse and rare disease.

Nutlin-3, a small-molecule antagonist of MDM2, inhibits proliferation in cancer cells with wild-type p53 by blocking the interaction of MDM2 and p53. However, different cancer cells differ greatly sensitivity of Nutlin-3 because of MDM2 amplification and/or p53 mutation status. Herein, we evaluate the sensitivity of Nutlin-3 in different cancer cell lines including four mesothelioma cell lines, one breast cancer line, and one leiomyosarcoma cell line with nonmutant p53 expression, two liposarcoma cell lines harboring MDM2 amplification and wild-type p53, and one control mesothelioma cell line JMN1B harboring p53 point mutation. Unexpectedly, Nutlin-3 treatment induced cyclin D1 expression accompanied with inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction in nonmutant cancer cell lines. Additive effects were obtained through a coordinated attack on MDM2-p53 interaction and cyclin D1, as demonstrated by immunoblots, cell viability and cell cycle analyses, showing that lentiviral mediated cyclin D1 knockdown or drug inhibition, and block of MDM2-p53 interaction, in cancer cell lines containing wild-type p53, induced greater anti-proliferative effects, compared to either intervention alone. Further results demonstrated that upregulation of cyclin D1 after Nutlin-3 treatment to some extent was dependent on expression and ubiquitin E3-ligase activity of MDM2.

There are no systemic therapeutic regimens known to improve survival when complete surgical resection is not feasible, underscoring the need for an improved molecular understanding of LPS to stimulate the development of effective targeted therapies. The MDM2-p53 pathway plays a prominent role in WDLPS pathogenesis, with the vast majority of human tumors harboring either MDM2 amplifications or p53 mutations. Nutlin-3, a small-molecular antagonist of MDM2, inhibits cell proliferation via blocking the interaction of MDM2-p53 in LPS with wild-type p53. We wonder whether MDM2 overexpression due to amplification or/and mutant p53 still plays a crucial oncogenic role in LPS containing p53 mutation. Herein, we developed isogenic liposarcoma lines in which the parental forms were MDM2 amplification and p53 wild-type, whereas sublines had mutation p53 expression, showed Nutlin-3 resistance. mRNA sequencing and immunoblotting showed that MDM2 and CDK4 were overexpression in the parental lines and sublines, whereas MDM2 and CDK4 expression was low in mesothelioma and GIST cell lines. HDAC inhibitor (HDACi, SAHA and LBH589) treatment resulted in the dephosphorylation and degradation of MDM2 and p53, but little affected CDK4 and JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in LPS with MDM2 amplification, and in a mesothelioma cell line JMN1B with p53 mutation, but not two mesothelioma lines containing normal MDM2 level and wild-type p53. Our findings indicate that regulation of wild-type 53 degradation by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent. HDAC inhibition by SAHA and LBH589 had a substantially effect on LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival associated with upregulation of the PTEN and p21, inhibition of cell proliferation marker cyclin A and PCNA expression, induction of G1 or G2 phase arrest; induction of apoptosis showing an increase of caspase 3/7 activity and expression, PARP cleavage, and the sub-G1 apoptotic population. Moreover, we characterize biological functions of MDM2-p53 axis in nutlin-3-sensitive and nutlin-3-resistant LPS, showing MDM2 knockdown in the four LPS lines and p53 knockdown in the three mutant-p53 LPS lines resulted in anti-proliferative effects. Additive effects were obtained through a coordinated attack on MDM2 and p53, as demonstrated by immunoblots, cell viability and cell cycle analyses, showing that MDM2 and p53 knockdown, in LPS cell lines containing the p53 mutation, induced greater cell apoptosis and anti-proliferative effects, compared to either intervention alone, which is comparable to the effects seen after HDAC inhibition by SAHA and LBH589.

Methods', ' A 68-year-old female patient with a history of breast cancer diagnosed 4 years ago, currently on antiestrogen therapy (Fulvestrant) and Herceptin, presented to our university hospital with symptomatic left pelvic mass.

Results', ' A debulking surgery including radical hysterectomy was planned. Intraoperatively, a normal sized uterus was found, the myometrium of which contained multiple variable-sized intramural leiomyomata.

To improve chemotherapy efficacy and patient survival, novel drugs will require a greater mechanistic understanding of tumor initiating cell (TIC) regulatory pathways. Intratumoral heterogeneity is a major obstacle for conventional targeted treatment modalities, which select for aggressive phenotypes with acquired drug resistance and TIC enrichment. Here we focus on elucidating the role of Mdm2 in mediating TIC levels in osteosarcoma (MG-63, Saos2) and breast cancer (MDA 231, MDA 468, and BT474) cell lines. We demonstrate Mdm2 silencing by ShRNA results in increased levels of Nanog, Oct4a, and Sox2, and diminished expression of ER and ER by western blot. We observed an increase in the immunophenotypic expression of CD133 in ShMdm2 osteosarcoma and breast cancer cell lines by flow cytometry. Our data provides the first evidence that loss of Mdm2 results in increased TIC population. Further analysis will examine the affects of TIC using small molecular inhibitors to Mdm2.

One mechanism is by genomic amplification and consequent overexpression of the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2, which targets p53 for proteosome-mediated degradation. The MDM2 gene is amplified in >95% of human liposarcomas, a disease for which the efficacy of systemic therapies is limited. Here, we compared the effects of two novel highly potent and selective inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction, with the classic MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 on the expression and activity of p53 and the resulting changes in human liposarcoma cell proliferation and survival. We determined MDM2 copy number, p53 mutational status, and relative expression levels of MDM2 and p53 proteins in 8 human liposarcoma cell lines and normal human preadipocytes/adipocytes. TP53 status was wild type in 7 of 8 liposarcoma cell lines, which also had genomic amplification of MDM2. MDM2 protein expression correlated with the degree of amplification and was highly expressed in comparison to normal preadipocytes/adipocytes. The two spiro-oxindole derivatives - Compounds A and B- (1) and Nutlin-3 were applied to liposarcoma cell lines with or without p53 siRNA and the biological consequences were determined by immunoblot, cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis assays. Treatment with MDM2 inhibitors led to increased p53 protein levels and induction of its transcriptional targets MDM2 and p21. Cell viability was markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in liposarcoma cells with wild-type p53, with IC50 values of 0.40-4.23 M, 0.37-1.88 M and 2.72-9.83 M for Compound A, Compound B, and Nutlin-3, respectively. These effects were markedly abrogated by siRNA-mediated p53 knockdown and in a cell line harboring a de novo p53 mutation. Compound A and Compound B also induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at approximately 5 fold lower concentrations than Nutlin-3. At low concentrations, G0/G1 cell arrest occurred, whereas higher concentrations resulted in G2/M arrest and induction of apoptosis. Cell line and tumor xenograft experiments are ongoing. These data demonstrate that Compounds A and B are highly potent and specific inhibitors of MDM2 with activity in genetically characterized liposarcoma cells.

        "Background":"['Cell fusion is a physiological process utilized by a variety of biological systems during fertilization, embryogenesis, and cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. During the malignant transformation of breast and bone tissues, normal and malignant cells become fused to form hybrid structures. These enhanced phenotypes acquire genetic characteristics which support initiation, progression, and oncogenesis. In breast cancer and osteosarcoma cell lines, cell fusion generates chromosomal instability, aneuploidy, and DNA damage while maintaining the characteristics of enhanced migration, invasion, and chemoresistance. We have found that mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) significantly induces cell fusion and the generation of large multinucleated cells in MDA468, MDA231, MDA157, T47D breast cancer and MG63 osteosarcoma cell lines under normoxia when compared to silenced Mdm2 controls (P<0.0005). Interestingly, silencing mutant p53 in the MDA468 cell line resulted in significantly higher fusion events (P<0.0004) suggesting mutant p53 may play a regulatory role in reducing Mdm2-associated cell fusion. Silenced Mdm2 MDA231 cells showed a three-fold increase under hypoxia whereas MG63 cells showed similar levels of cell fusion events as in normoxic conditions suggesting cell specific dependency to environmental stimulus. The variation in proportions of cell fusion among each cell type suggests this phenomenon is dependent on Mdm2 expression and cell type. CD133+ MDA468 cells have increased fractions of polyploidal cell events suggesting stemness may influence the polyploidal giant cancer cell (PGCC) dynamics. The mechanism by which cell fusion occurs in breast and osteosarcoma is poorly understood. Collectively these data suggest the interplay of Mdm2, p53, and stemness in supporting the formation of fused polypoidal cells and may serve as relevant targets for cancer therapy.']",

Optimized members of this family of molecules are currently under clinical investigation as novel therapeutic modality for cancers expressing wild-type p53. We have shown previously that MDM2 antagonists are most effective in cancer cells that overproduce MDM2 as a result of mdm2 gene amplification (Tovar et al., PNAS, 2006, 103, 1888). Here, we show that reduction of MDM2 protein by RNA interference decreases the effectiveness of nutlin-3a in osteosarcoma cells with mdm2 gene amplification, suggesting that MDM2 protein contributes to antitumor activity of MDM2 antagonists. In search of the mechanism behind this phenomenon, we found that nutlin-induced p53 activates the transcription of a specific subset of microRNAs in cancer cells with mdm2 amplification but not in cells expressing normal levels of MDM2 protein. Five specific members of the class (miR1, miR133, miR141, miR184, miR375) were studied and showed that their p53-dependent transcription is also dependent on the presence of high levels of MDM2 protein, generated by continuous p53 activation of MDM2 in the presence of nutlin. Weak p53 response elements were found in the promoter regions of all five miRs and p53 binding was conformed by ChIP analysis of cell lysates and p53 reporters in experiments with miR375. Transcriptional cofactor p300 was found elevated in cancer cells with mdm2 gene amplification and dependent on the presence of high MDM2 protein levels. Our experimental data suggests that in the presence of high p300, and high MDM2, generated by nutlin treatment, p53 acquires the ability to activate weak p53-responsive miR promoters in MDM2-amplified cells. Interestingly, miR mimics of two of the five p53-induced miRs showed growth suppressive effects in cancer cells and enhanced the activity of low dose nutlin-3a. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for modulation of p53 transcriptional activity and indicate that the high levels of MDM2, generated in mdm2-amplified cancer cells in the presence of nutlin, contribute to its antitumor.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Increased MMPs activity in MDM2 overexpressing cancer cell lines.",
        "Background":"['The matrix metalloprotenases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidase and have proteolysis activity which found to impact several physiological and pathophysiological conditions including cancer. In cancer, over 20 types of MMPs promote invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and proliferation. For instance, MMP-9 is involved in many processes such as wound healing, tissue remodeling and regulation of inflammation. So far, several studies have also shown that MMP-9 is associated with poor clinical outcome. MMP-9 can facilitate angiogenesis and metastasis by releasing cytokines, pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic factors. Conversely, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) is a well-known negative regulator of MMPs which can also modulate other biological functions independent of MMPs regulation. TIMP-1 dysregulation has been shown to impact ECM integrity and potentiate metastatic ability also. Similarly, MDM2 (Murine Double Minute) has been recognized as an important multi-domain protooncogene which is overexpressed in many types of cancer and is associated with poor prognosis in different tumor types including sarcomas and carcinomas. Previously, our group reported that MDM2 overexpression is regulating MMP-9/TIMP-1 axis in LNCaP and LNCaP-MST (MDM2 transfected) prostate cancer cells. In order to further analyze the status of MMP in MDM2 overexpressing cancers the fluorescence activity assay and the zymography assay were used for measuring the activity of MMPs including MMP-9. Immunoblotting analysis were also used to correlate the expression levels of MDM2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in MDM2 overexpressing cell lines with and without Nutlin-3 (20 uM) treatment. Our results indicated that MMP activity is elevated by 97.3 % in LNCaP-MST cells compared to LNCaP. This may be possibly due to the near knockdown levels of TIMP-1 that was observed in LNCaP-MST cells. However, the Nutlin 3 treatment was able to decrease the MMP-9 levels and activity only marginally, without elevating TIMP-1 levels. This suggests that, in addition to MDM2, the PTEN loss in LNCaP-MST cells may also play a role in regulating the levels of TIMP-1 and consequently the activity of MMP-9. Furthermore, in order to verify our original speculation, we analyzed the levels of TIMP-1 in SJSA1 and GI-101A cell lines, which are known to overexpress MDM2 and impart aggressive metastatic abilities. Interestingly, the levels of TIMP-1 were found to be elevated in both SJSA1 and GI-101A cell lines compared to LNCaP-MST cells. This finding indicates that TIMP-1 may paly dual role depending on cancer types and the gene expression status in the tumor microenvironment. Further studies are required to fully delineate the interplay between MDM2 and pro-metastatic mechanisms, including the expression of TIMP-1 and MMP-9.

        "Background":"['Mdm2 is a key regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 and over expression of Mdm2 is a negative prognostic marker for many cancers. Mdm2 expression is increased in estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cells that have the mdm2 G/G single nucleotide polymorphism at position 309 (mdm2 SNP309). In such cells, estrogen activates cell proliferation in an Mdm2 dependent manner. Alternatively spliced mdm2 transcripts have been observed in cancers, however, endogenous protein isoforms have not been detected. The exogenous expression of mdm2 splice variants encodes proteins, transforms cell lines in culture, and in the absence of p53 causes tumors in mice. Therefore we hypothesized that endogenous human Mdm2 protein isoforms participate in p53-independent tumorigenesis. We created a specific human Mdm2-C antibody to the splice junction of exons four and ten (Mdm2 C410) and validated the C410 antibody using in vitro translated Mdm2 compared to Mdm2-C. We detected, for the first time in human cancer cell lines, expression of endogenous Mdm2-C. This was particularly high in G/G mdm2 SNP309 breast cancer cells. In addition, using immunohistochemistry analysis three out of three Liposarcoma tissue samples tested positive for Mdm2-C expression. Using the C410 antibody we detected endogenous Mdm2-C protein in estrogen receptor positive T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. T47D cells (with mutant p53), and MCF-7 cells (with wild-type p53), both showed increased Mdm2-C protein expression after estrogen treatment. We also determined that Mdm2-C did not interact with p53. Interestingly, Mdm2-C protein localized in nucleolar and cytoplasmic speckles. The exogenous expression of Mdm2-C increased colony formation ability indicating that it had transforming capability. However contrary to results with exogenously expressed Mdm2-FL, exogenously expressed Mdm2-C did not influence p53 stability, or p53 transactivation activity. Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mdm2-C in T47D cells induced cell death. We engineered miR30-based inducible mdm2 knockdown cell lines of MCF-7 and T47D to evaluate the impact of multiple Mdm2 isoforms. The down-regulation of Mdm2 in MCF-7.shmdm2 and T47D.shmdm2 inhibited cell proliferation in 2D culture and in 3D laminin-rich matrigel. The knockdown of Mdm2 in T47D cells reduced colony size, reverted to cells to more normal mammary architecture, and decreased E2F protein expression. We suggest that survival of estrogen-influenced breast cancer is through a p53-independent, and thus non-canonical, Mdm2 isoform mediated mechanism.Special thanks to Gerard Evan for help with immunogen peptide design.

        "Background":"['MDM2 amplification, which is often seen in different cancer types, indicates that its plays an important role in tumorigenesis and also in cancer metastasis. Amplification of the MDM2 gene correlates with poor prognosis, aggressive growth, and reoccurrence. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) that is expressed by THBS1 gene is a matricellular protein, and is known to have differential expression in cancers. When TSP-1 activates Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) through latent cytokine complexation, the activated TGF-β1 contributes to the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) which is known to impart stem-cell like characteristics and drug resistance to the cancer cells. However, no studies regarding MDM2’s role in THBS1 regulation have been carried out so far. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the correlation between MDM2 and THBS1 expression in MDM2 overexpressing cancers. For this purpose the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cells were cultured at 37 oC under humidified air/CO2 (19', '1) in RPMI-1640 complete medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10,000 U/mL penicillin, 10,000 µg/mL streptomycin, 1% (+)-L-glutamine, and 1% amphotericin B. The cells were incubated in the presence of 20 µM of Nutlin-3 for 24 hrs, following which, RNA and protein were extracted and subsequently purity and concentration were determined. Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were performed using specific primers, primary and the secondary antibodies respectively. Interestingly elevated levels of TSP-1 and TGFβ1 were observed in these SJSA-1 cells. However, after treatment with Nutlin-3, an MDM2-p53 interaction inhibitor, a significant increase in p53 was noted. However, contrary to the existing literature, where studies have shown p53 to positively regulate TSP-1 levels, we observed an opposite outcome. Despite the Nutlin-3 induced elevation in p53 levels, a significant decrease in TSP-1 level was observed indicating that MDM2 may be regulating THBS1 gene expression in a p53 independent manner, in MDM2 overexpressing SJSA-1 cells. The findings of this study suggest a novel, p53 independent role for MDM2 in THBS1 regulation. Since MDM2 amplification can positively induce TSP-1 levels, which is one of the natural activators of TGF-β1, it is anticipated that stimulatory signal flowing through MDM2 - TSP-1 - TGF-β1 axis may induce the cancer cells to undergo EMT, thereby increasing their metastatic ability and promote cancer stem cell characteristics. This novel MDM2-regulated pathway can very well serve as a drug target and might play a biologically relevant role in the treatment of cancer metastasis. Our future studies will include validation of this correlation in multiple cancer cell lines, to further elucidate the mechanism through which MDM2 is regulating THBS1 gene expression.

Tumor shrinkage was seen but did not meet RECIST criteria. Two pts with previously progressing LPS and carcinoid remain on study for 26+ mos and tumor sequencing showed MDM2 gene amplification. Exposures of DS-3032b were significantly higher in pts with lower body weight. Induction of MIC- 1 (PD biomarker of WT p53 reactivation) correlated with drug exposure. Conclusions', ' DS-3032b has an acceptable safety profile at the MTD of 120 mg (QD 21/28). Clinical benefit with durable SD was seen in tumors with aberrant MDM2 signaling and WT p53. MDM2 is universally amplified in LPS and TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer; warranting further investigation of DS-3032b. Pts with melanoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are being enrolled in 2 dose-expansion cohorts (part 2) at the tentative recommended phase 2 dose 120 mg QD 21/28.

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer of the sympathetic nervous system with wide heterogeneity regarding clinobiological subtypes, ranging from patients with tumors of spontaneous regression to patients with aggressive tumors with fatal outcome despite multimodal treatment. MYCN-amplification and 11q-deletion are important, although incomplete, markers of high-risk neuroblastoma. Thus, characterization of additional genomic alterations that can be used as prognostic and/or predictive markers is of clinical importance in order to provide best possible treatment.From genomic profiles generated through high-density SNP microarrays we identified a group of neuroblastomas (14 primary tumors and two cell lines) with regional high grade amplification of one or multiple loci on the long arm of chromosome 12, commonly involving either chromosomal region 12q13-14, 12q15 or both. Amplification of these regions has also been reported in other malignancies such as liposarcoma, glioma and lung cancer. The two different 12q regions contains the potential oncogenic target genes; CKD4 (12q13-14) and MDM2 (12q15), involved in cell cycle progression and p53 regulation respectively. The CDK4 and MDM2 regions were co-amplified in 13/16 neuroblastoma samples while two tumors had CDK4 amplification in absence of MDM2 amplification and one tumor had MDM2 amplification without CDK4 amplification. Exome sequencing was performed for seven of the primary tumors with 12q-amplification. No novel protein altering single nucleotide variant (SNV) were detected within the amplicons with exception of a rare INHBE K222Q mutation in one patient. The exome sequencing also indicated that two tumors had a substantial number of additional rearrangements at subclonal level within the amplified regions, including a break of MDM2 in intron 8 for one of these patients. Interestingly, the majority of the 12q-amplified neuroblastoma was of abdominal origin, some with renal location with initial suspicion of Wilms tumor. Atypical metastatic pattern were also seen in this patient group showing low degree of bone marrow involvement favoring other metastatic sites such as lung, otherwise an uncommon localization in neuroblastoma.The consistent co-amplification of two separate chromosome 12 regions in this subset of neuroblastoma suggests that these regions contain one or more genes with importance in tumor development. Our study indicates that CDK4 appears as main target in this 12q-amplified neuroblastoma subgroup although other genes such as MDM2 and FRS2 also could provide proliferative advantages. The 12q-amplified neuroblastoma exhibit distinct clinical features and can benefit from targeted therapy using a small molecule CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor such as LEE011 (Novartis).']",

        "Background":"['Although functional inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 is a frequent genetic event, half of all human tumors express wild-type p53. Stabilization of p53 by antagonizing its negative regulator mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) leads to selective induction of the p53 pathway, thus offering a promising therapeutic opportunity.NVP-CGM097 binds in the p53 pocket on the surface of Mdm2 and effectively disrupts the interaction between p53 and Mdm2. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and efficacy profile of this novel p53-Mdm2 inhibitor in mouse models of human cancer. During the medicinal chemistry discovery efforts, the compound series was optimized for oral administration. The selected compound, NVP-CGM097, was well absorbed in mice where the maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was observed about 3 hours post dose followed by a prolonged absorption phase. PD effects were determined by measuring the expression levels of p53 target genes including p21, PUMA and Mdm2 in tumors. The expression levels of p53 target genes correlated with the concentrations of NVP-CGM097 demonstrating a good PK/PD relationship.Optimal treatment schedules were investigated in the Mdm2-amplified, p53 wild-type osteosarcoma xenograft model SJSA-1. Interestingly, various schedules were highly efficacious at well-tolerated dose levels. Tumor regression was observed when NVP-CGM097 was administered in schedules ranging from daily to twice per week with no adverse effects. Following dose optimization studies, potent anti-tumor efficacy was observed in a range of p53 wild-type expressing xenograft models including Mdm2 non-amplified orthotopic AML as well as well-differentiated (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated (DDLPS) liposarcomas.Overall, we demonstrate that the novel p53-Mdm2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097 has a good PK profile and affects PD markers in human tumors leading to tumor regression at well-tolerated dose levels.

Aberrant HDM2 overexpression and gene amplification contributed to accelerated cancer development and growth. Several small molecule inhibitors of HDM2-p53 protein-protein interaction have been reported in recent years with anti-tumor activities in tumor xenograft models. Here we describe a novel and potent small molecule inhibitor of HDM-p53 inhibitor that binds selectively to HDM2 with high affinity compared to HDM4. Treatment of cancer cells with this HDM2 inhibitor results in activation of p53 pathway as demonstrated by study of pharmacodynamic biomarkers both in cell culture and in tumor xenograft in vivo. More importantly, cancer cells response to this HDM2 inhibitor is mechanism based and dependent on the presence of functional p53 status as shown in a profiling of a broad-panel of cancer cell lines. This inhibitor is very potent against cancer cell growth with IC50 below 200 nM for most cell lines tested in vitro. It is orally bioavailable and has single agent activity that results tumor regression in SJSA-1 osteosarcoma model or growth inhibition in A549 NSCLC and A2780 ovarian cancer xenograft models.

Despite long-lasting remissions with the KIT inhibitor imatinib (IM) most patients eventually progress. While inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) may confer resistance in other cancers little is known about the role of IAPs in GIST. Material and Methods IAP expression (cIAPs, XIAP, survivin) in patient samples (TMA, n=163), IM-sensitive (GIST-T1, GIST882, GIST430) and IM-resistant (GIST48B, GIST48) GIST cell lines (RT-PCR, western blot) was analyzed. The impact of KIT and growth inhibitory drugs on IAP expression (24h of treatment) was determined by western blot. Biological consequences of IAP modulation (YM155', ' transcriptional repressor of survivin; Embelin', ' biochemical XIAP inhibitor; lentiviral shRNA knockdown [KD] of survivin, XIAP) were investigated alone and in combination with KIT-related pathway inhibitors (IM, LY294002, 17-AAG). Results cIAPs, XIAP and survivin were expressed at various levels in all KIT-positive and negative GIST cell lines. Resistant cell lines did not exhibit higher levels of IAPs. Survivin expression was found to vary over time in GIST-T1 and 48B (2- and 4-fold within 5 days. Survivin expression (immunoreactivity score 3) was found in 40% of GIST patients. PI3K inhibition led to survivin downregulation of 20 to 65% (24h) in all tested cell lines whereas KIT inhibition (IM, 24h) reduced survivin and XIAP expression only in GIST-T1 (52%). The protein levels of both XIAP and survivin were decreased following HDAC (SAHA', ' 44-71%, except GIST430) and MDM2 inhibition (survivin', ' 40 - 90%). YM155 downregulated survivin and exhibited proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects in all cell lines at low nM levels (IC50', ' GIST-T1', ' 4nM, GIST48P', ' 40nM, GIST48B, GIST 882', ' 80nM) except GIST430 (IC50>1M). No antagonistic effects were seen with combinational treatment. Embelin treatment resulted in IC50 levels of 40M - 300M while lacking a specific XIAP inhibition. A stable XIAP KD was established in GIST-T1 resulting in slower growth (25% in 3d). Conclusion IAPs are commonly expressed in GIST cell lines regardless of resistance to IM. Expression levels are mostly independent from KIT inhibition but proapoptotic effects from HDAC and MDM2 inhibitors may in part be conferred by IAPs. The survivin repressor YM155 showed antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects at levels that are therapeutically achievable suggesting a potential therapeutic role in GIST.']",

Although the emergence of multidrug therapies has improved available treatments for osteosarcoma, approximately 30% of patients will still develop metastasis. Thus, there is a clear need to identify new anticancer therapies. Currently, much anticancer therapy uses drugs that affect molecular targets, such as up-regulation of p53 and down-regulation of Sp1. Building on this knowledge, our aims in this work were to evaluate the ability of trans-Chalcone to reduce viability, induce apoptosis, and to alter the levels of p53 and Sp1 in human osteosarcoma cell lines. Chalcones are secondary metabolites of plants and have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in human cancer cells. Methods', ' Osteosarcoma cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of p53 and sp1 was assessed by Western blotting. Transcriptional and post-translational regulation were measured by luciferase assay and proteasomal inhibitor experiments. Results', ' We identified that cell growth was inhibited by trans-Chalcone in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with a significant inhibition at 10 M after 48 hours. After 24 hours of treatment with trans-Chalcone, apoptosis was induced in a dose-dependent manner-fold induction at 1.9 and 3.6 at 10 M and 50 M, respectively, compared to control. Western blot analysis indicated that trans-chalcone reduced Sp1 and induced p53 expression, compared to control cells. Further experiments suggest that trans-Chalcone affected Sp1 down-regulation at the transcriptional level, whereas trans-chalcone up-regulated p53 expression at the post-translational level. These results were confirmed by a luciferase assay of the MDM2 promoter and a proteasomal degradation assay using several inhibitors. Conclusions', ' Trans-Chalcone inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells and targets p53 tumor suppressor and Sp1 oncogenic proteins in osteosarcoma. Thus, trans-chalcone could be the focus of future clinical trials to develop an anti-cancer drug for osteosarcoma patients.Support', ' The University of Tennessee Center of Excellence in Livestock Diseases and Human Health and a grant (No. process', ' BEX 3159/14-0) from the CAPES Foundation, an agency under the Ministry of Education of Brazil.']",

For the current study, we expressed various EP53 proteins in human cancer cells with different p53 status, including osteosarcoma (U2-OS, Saos-2), glioblastoma (T98G), and breast cancer (MCF7). Western blot analysis confirmed EP53 expression. We compared apoptosis in the human cancer cells transfected/transduced with negative control vectors vs. epitope or protein-tagged EP53 exposed to doxorubicin (to induce DNA damage). Apoptosis was measured by cell viability, caspase activity, Propidium Iodide/Annexin V staining, and fluorescence microscopy. We observed a significant increase in caspase activity (normalized to cell viability) of U2-OS and T98G cells expressing EP53 compared to negative control treated cells as shown in Table 1, and apoptosis with p21 restoration in Saos-2. In U2-OS, which overexpress MDM2, EP53 was more effective at inducing apoptosis compared to human TP53. Taken together, we found that EP53-anc restored p53-mediated apoptosis and EP53-anc / EP53-retro9 enhanced p53-mediated apoptosis. These data suggest for the first time that EP53 functions in human cancer cells to promote cell death. Ongoing efforts are exploring the EP53 mechanism of action that leads to increased apoptosis, including expression of EP53 in additional cancer types (lung, melanoma, colon, prostate, and others) with a variety of genetic backgrounds to characterize its functional context.

In 55 pts evaluable for efficacy, disease control rate (DCR) was 45%, including 2 CR (Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma [PTCL], Merkel Cell Carcinoma), 2 PRs (Colorectal Cancer, Liposarcoma) and 21 pts with SD. In WT TP53 pts who initiated ALRN-6924 at 0.8 mg/kg, DCR was 57%. 9 pts remain on treatment post data cutoff including 3 pts exceeding 1 year of treatment. Conclusions', ' ALRN-6924 was well tolerated and demonstrated intriguing anti-tumor activity in this first-in-human phase I trial. An expansion phase IIa cohort in PTCL opened in August 2016 using 3.1 mg/kg (arm A) and is currently enrolling. Clinical trial information', ' NCT02264613']",
