Results', '  We identified several mutations in genes previously related with ATC, including TP53 (30%), RAS (29%), PIK3CA (23%), STAT (23%), BRAF (15%), and mutations in genes involved in SWI/SNF (15%), CDK (15%), and hedgehog (15%) pathways. The analysis of the two cases of concomitant PTC and ATC present in the same thyroid gland showed a significantly different genomic background with few common root mutations between both tumor entities (3 and 9 mutations respectively were present with a similar allelic frequency in both tumors). Clonal oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations were enriched in PTC but decreased in ATC, while other well-known driver mutations were only detectable in the ATC samples, including TP53, PI3KCA, STAT and PDGFR. Globally, our results suggest an early clonal divergence of PTC and ATC during tumor evolution.

Targeted BRAF kinase inhibitors such as vemurafenib have shown promising results in clinical trials and off-label use for patients with BRAFV600E-positive tumors. While targeting BRAFV600E offers particular effectiveness and selectivity in inhibiting cancer cells in the short term, resistance does develop. Prior results in our laboratory confirmed that vemurafenib halts DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis in our mutated thyroid cancer cells. In addition, resistant BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer) cells were developed in our laboratory by exposing cells to increasing concentrations of vemurafenib. Resistant cells were characterized by hyperactive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and resistance to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. These additional targets mediating resistance provide an opportunity to devise novel synergistic combination therapies. Since antitumor effects of the widely used antidiabetic agent metformin were observed in thyroid cancer cells and the drug is thought to suppress mTOR, we investigated metformin adjuvant therapy in combination with vemurafenib. Various cell lines including Nthy-ori 3-1 (normal immortalized thyroid cells), BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer), vemurafenib-resistant BCPAP, and 8505c (anaplastic thyroid cancer) were analyzed in terms of cellular viability, apoptosis and expression of cell signaling molecules after exposure to both drugs. We found that the combination of vemurafenib and metformin caused significantly decreased viability in vemurafenib-resistant BCPAP cells. Furthermore, synergistic apoptosis was observed in BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells and 8505c anaplastic thyroid cancer cells in response to the combination treatment.

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer, which is three to four times more prevalent in women than men, is the most common endocrine-related cancer in the United States and its incidence has increased in the past three decades. Among various genetic lesions identified in thyroid cancer, the BRAF V600E mutation is found in 50% of papillary thyroid cancers and affords an opportunity for targeted drug therapy. Our laboratory identified estrogen as a promotional factor in thyroid cancer, as estrogen enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells in vitro. Since the mitotic activity of estrogen is partially mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, we hypothesized that a targeted BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4032, would inhibit estrogen-mediated tumor-promoting activity. Results demonstrate that PLX4032 abrogates estrogen-induced increases in proliferation and invasion of BRAF V600E-mutated BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, this phenomenon was not observed in Nthy-ori 3-1 thyroid cells, which are wild-type immortalized thyroid cells without the BRAF V600E mutation. Expression of estrogen receptor is not modulated by PLX4032 treatment, indicating that PLX4032 targets signal transduction pathways in estrogen-responsive thyroid cells. PLX4032 down-regulates the expression of key signaling molecules of the BRAF pathway, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (p-MEK), extracellular-signal regulated kinases (p-ERK), and mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) in BRAF-mutated BCPAP cells and does not alter the expression of these signaling molecules in wild-type Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. These results demonstrate a direct interlinking of a genetic lesion amenable to drug therapy with the promotional activity of estrogen. These findings will lead to an evaluation of combinational therapy including anti-estrogens and PLX4032 in preclinical animal models and a subset of patients harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. Targeting growth-promoting signal transduction pathways constitutively activated by genetic lesions will ultimately aid in overcoming resistance to traditional radioactive iodine therapy in patients with specific mutations such as BRAF V600E.']",

        "Background":"['Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, aggressive and fatal cancer with a median survival of 3-5 months after diagnosis. Our long-term goal is to develop better therapies based on the biology of ATC that contributes to improved tumor response and a reduced risk of potential side-effects. We recently showed that the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member MCL1 is overexpressed in a subset of ATC and that targeting of MCL1 with quinacrine leads to increased sensitization to the BRAF inhibitor sorafenib. To further investigate the importance of BCL2 family proteins in ATC, we analyzed gene expression data from several published independent gene expression studies. We discovered that both papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and ATC surprisingly overexpress the mRNA of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member NOXA. However, despite the observed overexpression of NOXA mRNA in several ATC cell lines, we find that NOXA protein expression, by contrast, is low. NOXA protein has previously been shown to be subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Indeed, through bioinformatics, we find overexpression of several ubiquitin enzymes in ATC suggesting that the half-life of NOXA protein may be selectively reduced in this tumor type. We are further assessing differences in the turnover of NOXA protein in ATC cells and are investigating if restoring NOXA protein expression may synergize with the pharmacologic targeting of MCL1 and other anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members. Interestingly, through TCGA analysis, we discovered that BCL2 overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in thyroid cancer (THCA) patients. Indeed, treatment with the BCL2/BCLXL inhibitor navitoclax showed encouraging efficacy and synergized with the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 in the ATC cell line 8505C. This was based on the expectation that MLN4924 would rescue NOXA protein expression. We are pursuing mechanistic studies in a larger panel of thyroid cancer cell lines and in vivo efficacy and toxicity studies. We conclude that restoring NOXA protein expression can together with the rational targeting of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members may allow for the expansion of the limited ATC-selective treatment strategies currently available.']",

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is increasingly common in the United States. Although prognosis is generally very good, thyroid cancer has a high recurrence rate and there are limited treatment options available for advanced metastatic disease. Since genetic mutations causing over-activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway are found in over 70% of papillary thyroid cancers, molecular inhibitors targeting these kinases are promising therapeutics. A multikinase inhibitor, Sorafenib, was recently FDA-approved for treatment of advanced thyroid cancer as it significantly increased progression-free survival time. To build upon this success, improvement in efficacy and reduction in common side effects may be possible through more targeted approaches. The most common specific mutation to target is BRAFV600E which occurs in 50% of papillary thyroid cancers and 25% of anaplastic thyroid cancers. BRAFV600E is correlated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, resistance to traditional therapy, and cancer-related mortality in papillary thyroid cancer. PLX4032 (Vemurafenib) is a specific kinase inhibitor developed to halt BRAFV600E-mediated excessive activation of the MAPK pathway. BRAFV600E-positive malignant melanoma patients treated with PLX4032 often experience astounding tumor regression followed by development of drug resistance, which is thought to be acquired through signaling via alternative molecules, bypassing the need for BRAFV600E kinase activity. We hypothesized that treatment with PLX4032 would inhibit MAPK signaling and promote an anti-proliferative phenotype in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAFV600E, without having these effects on BRAF-wildtype cells. In BRAF-mutated cells, we also predicted that certain signaling molecules could become activated to circumvent the PLX4032-mediated inhibition, as seen in melanoma. Results demonstrate that PLX4032 inhibits proliferation, causes apoptosis, and arrests cell cycle selectively in BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cells. These phenotypic responses corresponded to diminished phosphorylation of central signaling proteins downstream of BRAF, including MEK, ERK, and mTOR. The mutated papillary thyroid cancer cells express both MAP3K8 (COT) and CRAF, kinases capable of growth-promoting signaling independent of BRAFV600E, in the face of PLX4032 treatment over time. These results indicate that targeted inhibition of BRAFV600E creates powerful anti-tumor effects in thyroid cancer cells, although mechanisms of resistance similar to those seen in melanoma patients may also occur. Detailed investigation into cell signaling pathways that contribute to thyroid cancer progression will allow for more effective combinational targeted molecular therapy and limit development of drug resistance to specific inhibitors such as PLX4032.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAFV600E mutation represents the most common oncogenic event in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Although at a much lower frequency, different missense point mutations (K601E, G474R, G469R) and complex genetic alterations, such as rearrangements (AKAP9-BRAF) or frameshift mutations (V600EK601del, V599ins, V600D-FLAGT601-605ins, T599I-VKSRdel), have also been reported in PTC. In contrast with PTC, no other alteration different from the V600E substitution has been shown in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). In this study, we sought to determine the functional relevance of particular aminoacid residues, within the BRAF kinase domain, that we found mutated in some ATC. Fifty-four ATC were investigated for the existence of mutations at the activation loop, the glicine-rich phosphate-binding loop and the AKT binding sites of BRAF by means of PCR-SSCP and direct sequence. The structural-conformational changes behind punctual, unreported BRAF mutations and their effect on BRAF catalytic activity, substrate binding and downstream MAPK signalling were evaluated. Besides the V600E mutation, two additional point mutations (G615E and G474R) were detected within the BRAF kinase domain. The prevalence of both mutations, G615E (11% = 6 ATC) and G474R (7.4% = 4 ATC), was much lower than that of V600E (20% = 11 ATC). Interestingly, structural biology studies showed that G615E and G474R induced profound conformational changes within the BRAF kinase domain that resulted in reduced catalytic activity, decreased substrate binding and impaired downstream signalling. The G474R mutant, by preventing the N lobe from folding into a well ordered beta sheet structure, caused a broken or distorted phosphorylation-loop (P-loop). Because the P-loop is pivotal for ATP coordination and phosphotransfer reactions, the kinase activity of the BRAF G474R mutant was severely compromised and BRAF was unable to phosphorylate the downstream substrate. The G615E mutant by disrupting the structural integrity of the activation segment in the C lobe could in addition inhibit substrate binding. Significantly, none of the ATC bearing the G615E or the G474R mutation expressed the phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), which specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated and active forms of ERK1 and ERK2. This observation not only supported the existence of impaired BRAF kinase activity in vivo but also suggested the abrogation of intracellular MEK/ERK signalling in those tumours. In summary, this study demonstrates that G615E and G474R behave similarly to D594V and the kinase-dead BRAFK483M mutant, knocking-down BRAF catalytic activity and downstream MEK/ERK signalling. Clinical trials involving the inhibitor of threonine/serine kinases Sorafenib or kinase specific inhibitors targeting constitutively active BRAF will prove inefficient therapeutic strategies in patients with G615E or G474R mutations.']",

However, the toxicities of these inhibitors are uniquely highlighted in an indolent disease like PTC, which would require patients to endure toxicities long-term. Our goal was to determine if tetrathimoybdate (TM), a well-tolerated copper chelator we have previously shown to inhibit BRAF-mutated melanoma via MEK inhibition, can inhibit BRAF-driven PTC growth. Methods', ' We assessed TM in comparison to current standard of care (SOC), Lenvatinib and Sorafenib, and mutant BRAF inhibitor, Vemurafenib. Anchorage independent growth assays were used to test the inhibitory effect of these drugs on human BRAF-mutated PTC cell lines. We then confirmed these findings by treating a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of aggressive BRAF-driven PTC. Results', ' TM inhibited 57.5% of colony growth in vitro, which was not significantly different from the 42.4% and 32.2% inhibition by Sorafenib and Lenvatinib, respectively. TM inhibition was less effective than the 70.3% inhibition by Vemurafenib (p =0.04). We confirmed these results in vivo, where mice on the TM arm, on average, were observed to have 14.8% of their thyroid glands occupied by tumor, a statistically significant reduction from the mice in the control arm, whose tumor load averaged 23.6% (p= 0.008). This 37.4% reduction in tumor burden was not statistically different from the 35.2% reduction measured in the Vemurafenib arm, where mice on average had 15.3% of their thyroid glands replaced by tumor. Conclusions', ' The copper chelator, TM, was as effective as the SOCs, Lenvatinib and Sorafenib, at inhibiting the growth of human PTC in vitro.

The underlying mechanism to the acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition involves c-Met-mediated reactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore combinatorial dual targeted therapy of BRAF and c-Met inhibition has shown to reverse EMT and show maximal antitumor effect. Previously, the authors have developed a novel in vivo imaging strategy using CD44-targetable near-infrared (NIR)-sensitive supramolecular hydrogels (NIRSHs) for the recognition of CD44-expressing cancer cells. In the present study, we applied this NIR-sensitive molecular imaging probe in detecting the upregulated EMT changes in PLX4032-treated 8505C cells. The CD44-targetable NIRSHs were fabricated by polyplexing Cy5.5-conjugated polyethyleimine and hyaluronic acid in an aqueous medium. Ectopic xenograft mouse models were prepared by injecting 8505C cells at the flank of male athymic nude BALB/c mice, aged 6 weeks. After confirming tumor formation at 3 weeks post-injection, the mice were randomly divided into four groups and were each treated under different conditions; DMSO, PLX4032, PHA665752, PLX4032 and PHA665752. After 3 weeks, the pre-established NIRSH probes were injected and confirmed by IVIS imaging. The injected NIRSH probes showed highest uptake in the PLX4032 single treatment group and lowest uptake in the PLX4032 and PHA665752 combination group. Sizes of tumor were verified by MRI which showed correlations with the NIRSH fluorescence imagings. The results suggest that CD44-targetable NIRSHs imaging shows potential as a non-invasive in vivo imaging tool in detecting the increased invasion potential of cancer cells and monitoring appropriate therapeutic effects.']",

        "Background":"['Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, highly aggressive form of thyroid cancer that frequently is resistant to conventional therapy and therefore requires the development of efficacious novel therapy. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits the RAF, MEK and ERK kinases, was recently approved by the FDA for late stage metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer but appears to have limited activity in ATC by itself. Sorafenib-based drug combinations with complimentary drug targets are being pursued and evaluated preclinically. However, sorafenib generates a significant number of adverse events in thyroid cancer patients and drug combinations including sorafenib needs to be carefully tailored with respect to toxicity and efficacy. We have previously shown that quinacrine, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NFKB signaling, combine favorably with several cytotoxic drugs to target hepatocellular and colorectal cancer cells. Quinacrine is an inexpensive drug, has a well established safety profile in human subjects and is being evaluated in cancer clinical trials. Subsequently, we decided to evaluate the efficacy of the drug combination of quinacrine and sorafenib in ATC. Our combinatorial dose-response modulation of quinacrine with sorafenib suggests a synergistic drug-drug interaction with respect to growth stasis in a panel of ATC cells in vitro, as defined by Chou-Talalay. Furthermore, in vivo the drug combination of sorafenib and quinacrine significantly improved survival compared to vehicle control and the current first line chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in a mouse thyroid orthotopic xenograft model of ATC. Dose-escalation toxicity studies in mice suggest that the drug combination was well tolerated and did not trigger synergistic toxicities compared to either drug alone. Significantly less gastrointestinal injury, the most commonly observed toxicity in our study, was present following treatment with the drug combination of sorafenib and quinacrine compared to treatment with doxorubicin alone. Western blot analysis suggests that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 is a target for the drug combination. Indeed, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of resected ATC and non-neoplastic thyroid tissues from patients confirmed overexpression of Mcl-1 in ATC indicating target availability. Interestingly, multi-regression analysis of our patient IHC data suggest that high Mcl-1 expression together with tumor size prognosticated poor survival in ATC patients suggesting that Mcl-1 overexpression was linked to a more aggressive tumor behavior. In conclusion, our findings suggest that quinacrine in combination with sorafenib may be a novel and potentially cost effective therapeutic strategy to target Mcl-1, whose expression potentially may be linked to the disease progression of ATC.']",

The BRAFV600E point mutation represents the most common oncogenic event in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Although at a much lower frequency the BRAFV600E mutation is also present among less differentiated, more aggressive, I131 resistant forms of thyroid cancer as poorly differentiated carcinomas (PDCs) and undifferentiated carcinomas (UCs). Small molecule inhibitors targeting either the BRAF V600E protein or upstream or downstream kinases involved in MAPK signalling are currently under pre-clinical or clinical investigation in advanced, metastatic, I131 resistant thyroid cancers. Recently, immunohistochemical (IHC) studies on PTCs, using the VE1 mouse anti-human BRAF V600E antibody have shown to be a reliable means for detecting the BRAFV600E mutation in a clinical setting without molecular genotyping units. In this study we sought to determine the usefulness of the VE1 antibody for detecting the BRAF V600E mutant protein in a series of 103 aggressive thyroid cancers (59 PDCs and 44 UCs) previously characterized by PCR-SSCP for the presence of BRAF mutations in exons 11 and 15.

The staining intensity in BRAF V600E mutated samples ranged from weak to strong. Non valuable results were found in 3 PDCs and 4 UCs. Overall the results indicate that immunohistochemistry with VE1 antibody may be an alternative to molecular biology approaches for the routine detection of BRAFV600E point mutations in clinical settings without molecular genotyping facilities.

Sorafenib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits RAF, MEK and ERK kinases among other targets and is therefore being evaluated in several phase II/III clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Quinacrine, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NFKB signaling, is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials. We have previously shown the effectiveness of quinacrine in combination with cytotoxic drugs in hepatocellular and colon carcinoma cells acts by inhibiting NFKB, Mcl-1, and angiogenesis in tumor cell lines that are deficient in p53. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of quinacrine in combination with sorafenib on a panel of human ATC cells. Quinacrine as a single agent effectively inhibits growth and promote apoptosis of ATC cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by CellTiter-Glo and sub-G1 analysis respectively. Combinatorial dose-response modulation of quinacrine with sorafenib suggests a synergistic drug-drug interaction with respect to growth stasis of ATC cells in vitro, as defined by Chou-Talalay. Western blot analysis suggest that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1, over-expressed in a number of solid tumors, is efficiently down-regulated in the ATC cell line 8505C by the combination of quinacrine and sorafenib. We also observe that the active form of transcription factor Stat3 is down-regulated by both quinacrine and sorafenib. In contrast to chloroquine that inhibits autophagy, our previous results have not shown that quinacrine's anti-tumor efficacy involves alterations in autophagy. Furthermore, sorafenib and quinacrine significantly improve survival in a mouse thyroid orthotopic in vivo xenograft model of ATC. We are currently exploring the detailed molecular mechanism of the quinacrine and sorafenib drug synergy and associated anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo.

There are no effective treatment options in metastatic disease. Targeted therapies to ALK and BRAF are occasionally associated with dramatic responses. Retinoblastoma (Rb) inhibits cell cycle progression and is inactivated by CDK 4/6, which is the target for ribociclib. Nearly all differentiated thyroid cancers are Rb negative, conversely nearly 100% of ATC expresses intact Rb which may be crucial for rapid cell cycle progression. Ribociclib is a CDK 4/6 inhibitors that slows cell cycle progression and DNA replication in tumors with functional Rb. The p16 protein similarly inhibits CDK4/6; if p16 levels are high Rb is phosphorylated and thus inactive. p16 is low in ATC, and from our comprehensive genomic analysis 30% of ATC lacks the p16 gene CDKN2a. Most ATC demonstrates PI3K/Akt/mTOR abnormalities, this pathway represents an attractive target in ATC. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown promising efficacy in ATC cell lines, especially in those with TSC2 mutation whose wild type negatively regulates mTOR.

        "Background":"['Aberrant activation of the MAPK-mediated pathway components, RAF-MEK-ERK, is frequently found in human cancers and clearly contributes to oncogenesis. In particular, one of the three isoforms of RAF, BRAF, presents activating somatic mutations in 60% of melanomas, 50% of thyroid cancers, 10% of colon and 20% ovarian carcinomas. The most common BRAF mutation, substitution of glutamic acid for valine at position 600 within the activation segment of the kinase domain, accounts for 90% of mutated BRAF cases, and results in elevated kinase activity with consequent enhanced promotion of cell survival and proliferation. BRAF selective inhibitors as vemurafenib and dabrafenib have recently shown excellent results in patients with advanced melanoma expressing BRAF V600E mutant form. Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo properties of a novel potent and selective BRAF inhibitor belonging to the arylthiazole class of compounds. This, NMS-P285, is a potent inhibitor of both wild-type and mutated BRAF, with no cross-reactivity in a panel of 61 kinases. This compound occupies the ATP-binding pocket of the activated form of the enzyme (DFG motif in), partly filling the kinase back pocket, (i.e. type I  inhibitors). NMS-P285 has an antiproliferative activity in the low nanomolar range only against cell lines bearing BRAF V600E or V600D mutations. Its mechanism of action is confirmed', ' a strong inhibition of MAPK pathway was observed in BRAF mutated cells whereas in non-BRAF mutated cells MEK activation was not observed. NMS-P285 possesses a favourable in vitro ADME profile and a very good preliminary PK in mouse. When orally administered to mice with BRAF mutated human xenograft tumors, NMS-P285 resulted more potent than both vemurafenib and dabrafenib demonstrating high antitumor activity with strong and persistent tumor regression observed in all mice. Mechanism of action was demonstrated also ex vivo in A375 bearing mice', ' MAPK pathway resulted to be completely inhibited up to 6 hours after a single treatment at 30 mg/kg.

Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in colon, pancreatic, and lung cancers; BRAF mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant melanomas and from 40-60% of papillary thyroid cancers. MEK, a dual specific kinase, is a key player in this pathway; it is downstream of both Ras and Raf and activates ERK1/2 through phosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues. MEK162 (ARRY 438162) is a novel small molecule ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of the kinases MEK1 and MEK2. MEK162 showed promising data in an ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in patients with BRAF and NRAS mutated advanced melanoma. This is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS mutated melanoma. Methods and Results. The melanoma cell line panel was the most sensitive after investigating the growth inhibitory effect of MEK162 on 328 cancer cell lines from diverse histologies including melanoma, head and neck, colon, pancreas, lung, ovarian, liver, kidney, breast and endometrial. When a cutoff of IC50 <500nM or >70% Inhibition at 1uM after 6 days of culture was used 83% out of 47 melanoma cell lines were sensitive to the treatment with the MEK inhibitor. Sensitivity to MEK162 was independent of BRAFV600E andNRASQ61mutation status in this cell line panel. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed upon exposure to MEK162 using flow cytometry. MEK162 led to a G1 arrest and marked increase in apoptotic cells in the majority of the sensitive melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin and oncogenic driver mutations. Western blots were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to MEK162 in the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a decrease in pERK in all the cell lines tested regardless of their mutational status and the in vitro sensitivity. We observed an increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and wild type for NRAS and BRAF mutations cell lines than in BRAFV600Emutant cell lines. We found pAKT and pS6 decreased in the NRAS and BRAF mutant cell lines after treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of the mTOR pathway by MEK162 may be crucial for the sensitivity to the drug.

Due to the lack of distinguishing morphology, 10-25% of FNAs are termed indeterminate and required surgery. However, only 35% of them are found to have cancer. There is a need for a more accurate and minimally invasive cancer diagnostic technology. Our objective is to develop an inexpensive, point-of-care molecular diagnostic platform to isolate and detect thyroid specific proteins to enable real-world use of biomarkers to inform patient care. b) In this study, we engineer a miniature ion exchange column within a plastic (cyclic olefin polymer), disposable lab-on-a-chip platform for sample preparation and protein purification using microfluidic channels with a specialized porous polymer monolith (PPM)-based resin bed. We capitalized on the finding that cancer cells exhibit differential protein expressional patterns compared to normal thyroid cells by targeting thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1), a thyroid specific enhancer binding protein, as a biomarker for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. The ability to capture and release TTF-1 from the papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cell line was evaluated via western blot. We also tested various types of thyroid samples obtained from malignant and benign human thyroid nodules. c) We compared the efficiency of a small-scale protein prep using a commercial gravity column versus our lab-on-a-chip column. Our method showed TTF-1 protein was detectable from the lysate of 5x104 cultured BCPAP cancer cell line. In contrast, it was not detectable when purified by gravity ion-exchange column. We next showed that one can maximize the concentration of protein eluted from as fewer cells as possible. We found that by titrating the elution volume per fraction down to 10 l, the final concentration of eluted protein can be increased, and hence increase the downstream LOD to 104 cells. Next, we evaluated our extraction and purification system by using 10 mg patient thyroid tissue samples. We tested 11 human thyroid specimens for TTF-1 protein capture. They were all found to be positive which correlated with the official histopathological findings. All tissue extracts had measurable levels of TTF-1 protein and the levels of the TTF-1 were variable in the tissue specimens. We also tested one negative thyroid specimen. No TTF-1 protein was found. d) Our microfluidic protein extraction and purification system is a platform technology that may allow for optimal use of low-volume sample preparation such as we see in thyroid biopsies. This manner, when combined with an on-chip ELISA assay, would be a simple, cost effective test that gives the doctor all the needed information quickly in a single test.

M1 polarized macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines which induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells; a process where epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal traits, thus facilitating tissue infiltration and consequent metastasis. EMT as a marker of cancer progression is understudied in thyroid cancer. In our present study, we evaluated the crosstalk between the macrophages and the epithelial cells in the thyroid tumor microenvironment with the use of an in vitro model system consisting of an immortalized thyroid cell line (Nthy-ori 3-1), three papillary cancer cell lines (BCPAP, 8505C and TPC-1) and one follicular cancer cell line (CGTHW-1). We observed the halt in proliferation of the thyroid cancer cells as the epithelial cells differentiate into mesenchymal cells under the influence of activated macrophage conditioned media. We also observed a statistically significant (p<0.05) upregulation of migration and invasion of thyroid tumor cells in presence of macrophage conditioned media. Using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from the thyroid cancer cell lines, we observed that EMT markers including E-cadherin, -catenin, vimentin, NFk-B, snail, slug and twist are modulated in response to activated macrophage conditioned media. Downregulation of E-cadherin, required for maintenance of stable junction and -catenin essential for cell-cell adhesion was noticed in response to macrophage conditioned media. Transcription factors like NFk-B, snail and slug were translocated to the nucleus, which is indicative of the initiation of EMT. Our data provides evidence that macrophage secreted proteins play a crucial role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in thyroid tumor advancement and metastasis. We have successfully identified some significant markers including transcription factors such as NFk-B, slug, twist and snail that play a critical role in the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in thyroid cancer. These findings will allow for the possible development of targeted therapy designed at inhibiting EMT and subsequent suppression of thyroid cancer metastasis and dissemination.']",

Methods', ' We enrolled 26 patients in a prospective single institution phase II study. The first 7 did not receive chemotherapy; the next 19 received weekly doxorubicin (10 mg/m2) concurrently with IMRT (70Gy). Inclusion criteria included non-anaplastic, non-medullary DTC that is either grossly recurrent after surgery or unresectable with a Karnofsky Performance status > 60%. The primary objective was 2-year LRC rate of 90% in the group receiving concurrent chemotherapy compared to a historical LRC rate of 40%.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Chromosomal translocations resulting in formation of activating RET fusion genes have been identified in papillary thyroid cancer and 1-2% of NSCLC. We have previously shown that ponatinib, a pan-BCR-ABL and multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), potently inhibits the most common NSCLC fusion variant, KIF5B-RET, at clinically-achievable concentrations. Here we used patient-derived (PDX) tumor models to explore the potential involvement of RET fusions, and the efficacy of ponatinib, in other cancers.Results', ' To identify potential RET fusion-positive PDX tumor models, we examined RET mRNA levels in 273 PDX tumors (Crown Bioscience) from various cancer types, looking for models with outlier RET expression. To search for RET fusions, we performed RNAseq on 4 tumors that had the highest RET levels. Interestingly, RET fusions were detected in tumors from 2 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (pts) and not in tumors from 2 NSCLC pts that expressed similar levels of RET. The fusions detected in CRC pts, NCOA4-RET and CCDC6-RET, had previously been observed in NSCLC pts. Both CRC tumors were negative for other major hotspot mutations, including KRAS, BRAF and PI3K, suggesting that these RET-fusions might be primary oncogenic drivers in these tumors. To evaluate the cellular activity of ponatinib, we generated cell lines that were dependent on the activity of these fusions. Ponatinib potently inhibited the viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing NCOA4-RET and CCD6-RET with IC50s of 6 and 22 nM, respectively. Consistent with these effects being due to inhibition of RET, ponatinib inhibited RET phosphorylation with similar potency. Other TKIs with RET activity, vandetanib (IC50s', ' 564-1000 nM), cabozantinib (60-386 nM), sunitinib (277-584 nM), sorafenib (105-494 nM), and lenvatinib (68-257 nM), also inhibited viability of the Ba/F3 lines, but with potencies substantially reduced compared to ponatinib. Finally, we examined the efficacy of ponatinib in the RET fusion positive PDX colorectal models, compared to 2 RET fusion negative colorectal models. In the RET-negative models, daily oral dosing of ponatinib (20 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth by 24-41%. In contrast, ponatinib exhibited much greater efficacy in the RET-fusion positive models, inhibiting tumor growth by 79% in the NCOA4-RET model and inducing near complete regression in the CCDC6-RET model.Conclusion', ' We identified, for the first time, oncogenic RET fusions in CRC patient samples, suggesting RET may be a driver in a subset of CRC patients. Ponatinib effectively inhibited these fusions with potency substantially exceeding that of other RET inhibitors and demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in PDX models. These results provide strong support for the clinical evaluation of ponatinib in patients with RET-fusion positive cancers, including colorectal cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  The advent of targeted therapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer. The mutant BRAFV600E protein is found in over 50% of melanomas and thyroid carcinomas, resulting in elevated kinase activity, increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling, and cell proliferation. Vemurafenib and PLX4720 were designed to selectively inhibit the BRAF kinase, and clinical trials of vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma have demonstrated a response rate of over 50% and an overall survival advantage over standard dacarbazine therapy. Approximately 20-30% of individuals treated with vemurafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) highlighting the importance of understanding toxicities associated with this drug. Paradoxical ERK activation in BRAF wild-type, RAS-mutant cells is thought to be the major mechanism by which this occurs, as evidenced by the presence of RAS mutations in 60% of such lesions. Methods', '  Using a combination of BRAF-wild-type cSCC cell lines, primary human keratinocytes, as well as a UV mouse model of cSCC and human cSCC samples, we identified novel effects of BRAFi on apoptosis. Results', '  Here we show an unexpected and novel effect of vemurafenib and PLX4720 in suppressing apoptosis through the inhibition of multiple off-target kinases. JNK signaling and apoptosis are suppressed in cSCC lesions arising in vemurafenib-treated patients as well as in irradiated mouse skin. This occurs independently of paradoxical ERK signaling and in the presence of MEK inhibitor. Treatment with PLX4720 greatly accelerates the development of UV-induced cSCC in mice without Ras mutations. Kinome screening identified ZAK and MKK4 (MEK4 / MAP2K4) kinases as inhibited by vemurafenib, leading to suppression of MKK4 and MKK7 (MAP2K7) phosphorylation. Knockdown of inhibited off-target kinases recapitulates these anti-apoptotic effects of vemurafenib. Conclusions', '  Our results implicate suppression of JNK signaling, independent of ERK activation, as an additional, complementary mechanism of adverse effects of vemurafenib. This has broad implications for combination therapies with other modalities that induce apoptosis and for the long-term use of vemurafenib in the adjuvant setting.']",

Methods', ' We have initiated an open-label, multi-center, international Phase 1/2 study with larotrectinib in pediatric patients with solid tumors and primary CNS tumors (NCT02637687). Patients with advanced cancer between the ages of 1 year and 21 years are eligible, as well as patients as young as 1-month of age with a documented NTRK fusion. Patients with IFS who have not had definitive surgery are also eligible. Larotrectinib is administered orally twice daily on a continuous 28-day schedule. Dosing is based on body surface area. Larotrectinib is available in an oral liquid formulation and capsules. Following identification of the maximum tolerated dose of larotrectinib in the phase 1 portion, the phase 2 portion will commence. The phase 2 portion will enroll patients with NTRK-translocated tumors and measurable disease into three cohorts', ' 1) infantile fibrosarcoma; 2) extracranial solid tumors; and 3) primary CNS tumors. The primary endpoint for the phase 2 portion is objective response rate, with duration of response and progression free survival as secondary efficacy endpoints. Each phase 2 cohort will enroll in a single stage of up to 10 patients per cohort. Molecular abnormalities will be characterized through the analysis of archival tissue. Enrollment began in December 2015 and is ongoing. Clinical trial information', ' NCT02637687']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Sorafenib is an angiogenesis inhibitor recently approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and hepatocarcinoma. This oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor blocks the VEGF, PDGF receptors, BRAF and c-kit. In clinical trials, severe toxicities included rash, hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea. We investigated the relationship between severe toxicity and sorafenib plasmatic exposure. Patients and methods', ' From February 2008 to December 2008, 32 patients (pts) were treated with sorafenib (800 mg given daily). Clinical and blood exams were performed at baseline and every 2 weeks. Toxicity events were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 3.0. The sorafenib area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 12 hours (AUC0-12) was determined every 2 weeks by gradient elution liquid chromatography, data analysis with one-compartment disposition and a population approach using NONMEM software. Grade 3 toxicity free survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Results', ' Pts (23 males), ECOG 0-1 (27 pts), median age 62.8 years (range 37-78), with metastatic hepato-carcinoma (11), melanoma (6), thyroid cancer (8), renal cell carcinoma (7), received a median treatment duration of 94 days (range ', ' 7-330). 20 pts experienced grade 3 toxicities with 33 events', ' hand-foot hyperkeratosis (14), diarrhea (5), cutanous rash (4), asthenia (2), anorexia (2), dyspnea (1), scrotal toxicity (1), post surgical complication (1), hypertension (1), increase creatinine level (1), digestive hemorrhage (1). The median AUC0-12 was 62.4 mg/L.h, ranging from 28.7 to 202.2 mg/L.h. Amongst pts experiencing grade 3 toxicity, two groups of 16 pts were defined with the median AUC0- 12 as cut off', ' low exposure (Lw) and high exposure (Hi). Six Lw pts experienced grade 3 toxicity versus 14 Hi pts (exact Fisher Test p=0.009). The probability of free grade 3 toxicity survival was higher for Lw (Logrank test p=0.004). Conclusions', ' These results show that grade 3 toxicity occurrence may be related to high plasma sorafenib exposure. This supports the need for therapeutic drug monitoring to prevent toxicity grade 3 occurrence and therefore optimize the clinical management of patients under sorafenib.']",

        "Meeting_name":" A phase II study of pembrolizumab and docetaxel for aggressive RAI refractory thyroid carcinomas or salivary gland cancers",
        "Background":"['Background', ' Both aggressive, radioactive iodine refractory thyroid cancers as well as high-grade salivary gland cancers respond poorly to chemotherapy, and there is no widely used standard of care. Targeted thearpies as well as cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g. doxorubicin, or taxanes) are commonly used, but are only modestly effective. Both salivary gland and thyroid cancers have been shown to have tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor inflammation, and PD-L1 expression (Ayers, AACR 2015). Early data with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy using pembrolizumab (Keynote 28) show activity in 10a% of patients in a biomarker selected population (Keynote 28 thyroid and salivary gland cohorts). However, most patients are not PD-L1 positive and were not eligible. Recently synergy of anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade with cytotoxic chemotherapy was reported in several studies (e.g. Langer et al, Keynote 21G). Mechanistically chemotherapy may increase tumor inflammation, and eradicate immusupressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Data suggest a significant increase in the response rate e. g. in KN21G from 29% to 55%. Furthermore the depths of responses and durability improve, including patients with PD-L1 negative tumors. Methods', ' We hypothesize that the combination of PD-1 checkpoint blockade and cytotoxic chemotherapy will show synergistic activity in aggressive thyroid cancers and salivary gland cancers. Eligible patients will have radioactive iodine refractory, aggressive thyroid cancer (cohort A, N = 25 pts), or progressive salivary gland cancers (cohort B, N = 25 pts). There will be no PD-L1 or other biomarker selection. Patients must have progressed on prior therapy. Patients will receive docetaxel at a dose of 75mg/m2 Q21 days as well as pembrolizumab 200mg flat-dose Q21 days intravenously. The primary outcome of this study is response rate. The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy will increase the response rate from 20% (H0) to 40% (H1). A simon two-stage design will be used for each cohort (cohorts A and B) with an estimate 81% power in each arm. Patient screening and enrollment are expected to begin mid 2017.

        "Meeting_name":" An unbiased survey of cancer-related rearrangements in 5,917 solid tumors identifies therapeutically actionable fusions across multiple disease subtypes",
        "Background":"[\"The growing trend to make cancer treatment more precise depends on the accurate identification of clinically actionable genomic alterations within a patient's tumor. Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gene fusions exist across a multitude of tumor types and that known fusions are not always confined to the disease in which they appear most often. These rearrangements include clinically actionable fusions which may identify tumors that are sensitive to selective FDA-approved targeted agents.\"]",

However, the role of Bev in  the  3rd line Tx of MTCs is still unclear.This retrospective study summarizes our long-term experiences with Bev in patients (pts) with heavily pretreated MTC who did not qualify for recruitment into a controlled clinical trial. Methods', '  A total of 74 intensively pretreated MTC pts (OC, n = 65; FTC, n = 2; EC-II, n = 4; PPSC, n = 3) were included in this study with 43 (58.1%) being platinum-resistant. Pts had failed a median of 4 (range 1-10) prior chemotherapies (CTx ). Tx included Bev monotherapy (group A, n = 17), Bev + metronomic CTx (group B, n = 37), and Bev + conventionally dosed CTx (Group C, n=20). Bev was administered at either 10 mg/kg BW q2w or 15 mg/kg BW q3w. Adverse effects were classified according to CTCAE Vs 4.03. TTP was calculated from the start of Bev until progression, OS was calculated from the start of Bev until death or loss to follow up. Results', '  Most common Tx related toxicities were hypertension, proteinuria, headache, inflammation/infection, epistaxis, and subileus. Hypertension which often required adequate treatment was limiting in only one case as also were renal toxicity and infection. Median TTP was 27.8 wks and median OS was 53.6 wks with no significant difference between platinum-resistant and sensitive pts. In regard to both TTP and OS, there was a non-significant trend favoring groups A (33.4/63.0 wks) and B (29.9/61.6 wks) vs group C (19.2/35.4 wks). Conclusions', '  Bev based Tx was active and generally well tolerated in this hard-to-treat population of pts with recurrent MTC. Both TTP and OS were equal or even superior to any conventional CTx used in this setting. Moreover, clinical platinum-resistance did not predict a worse clinical outcome. Although this is not a randomized trial, our results argue in favor that Bev should be preferably given either as single agent or combined with metronomic CTx in pts with heavily pretreated MTCs. Further clinical trials of Bev in recurrent MTCs may prove useful.']",

Methods', '    HAGE protein expression was assessed in', ' a) 40 normal breast tissue (NBT), b) 60 invasive BCs and their matching NBT, c) BC cell lines, d) A series of 1650 consecutive cases of primary BC who treated with adjuvant CMF and/or endocrine therapies.

Moreover, HAGE+ expression showed an adverse outcome with a 2-4 fold increase in the risk of death, recurrence and metastases (ps<0.00001) compared to HAGE-; ps<0.0001.  Using a multivariate Cox regression model including ER status, grade, size and tumour stage, HAGE expression was confirmed as a powerful independent prognostic factor (p<0.0001). The poor clinical outcome of HAGE+ was further confirmed in high risk (NPI>3.4) ER- patients who did not received any CT (p<0.0001).
