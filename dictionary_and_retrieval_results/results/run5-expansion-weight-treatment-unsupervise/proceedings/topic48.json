        "Background":"['Background', 'ADCC is a form of cancer usually originating from saliva gland. The standard treatment is surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation if indicated. Cases of metastatic disease can behave indolently but ultimately can be fatal and there is no effective therapy. We present the results of NexGen sequencing of a 41yo caucasian female diagnosed with ADCC in 2003 who subsequently developed recurrence in 2005 and pulmonary metastases in 2006. She was treated with multiple agents including radiation. She had further progression with increase dyspnea in 2012. Commercial profiling by Caris Biosciences found expression of VEGFR, PDGFRA and PDGFRB. She was treated with Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor of the VEGFR, PDGFR, and BRAF without improvement, and she developed further dyspnea requiring oxygen. We performed NexGen sequencing of a biopsied metastatic lesion to identify somatic mutations and to determine if any targeted agent would be of further benefit. Results', ' NextGen sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed tumor biopsy sample. Blood DNA served as control. Using Illumina TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit, 100 bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the tumor and normal exomes. Resulting sequences were mapped to the Human Reference Genome (hg19) using two bioinformatics workflows', \" CLC Genomics Workbench and BWA/GATK. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (INDELs) were separately characterized for normal and tumor exomes. Finally, germline variants (SNVs and INDELs) were subtracted to identify putative somatic mutations in tumor exome. Concensus somatic mutations were obtained from CLC and BWA/GATK workflows. A total of 569 non-synonymous mutations and 35 stopgain mutations were observed in the tumor exome. Mutations in BRCA2, IGF1R, KDR, MTOR, TP63, XPC, RAD17, MLH1, and PTEN were observed in the tumor exome. Mutations in the components of kinase-mediated signaling (IGF1R, KDR, MTOR, PTEN) are potential targets of kinase and mTOR inhibitors whereas mutations in the DNA repair pathways (TP63, XPC, RAD17, MLH1) may be targeted with DNA alkylating agents. The result indicates that patient's tumor harbor several mutations that can be targeted by available cancer drugs. Conclusions\", ' We found several mutated molecular pathways that can be targeted with available agents using exome sequencing. Improvement in outcome could validate the role of exome sequencing in treatment selection of advanced cancers without standard therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' The curative rate of radiotherapy for unresectable malignancies of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses was only 10-15%. Proton beams are characterized by their rapid fall-off at the distal end of the Bragg peak and sharp lateral penumbra, depending on energy, depth, and delivery. These physical characteristics give proton beam therapy (PBT) better dose distribution than X-ray irradiation. Therefore PBT may improve treatment outcome of diseases which are located in proximity to risk organs. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical profile of PBT for unresectable malignancies of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Methods', ' We reviewed 40 patients in our database fulfilling the following criteria', ' unresectable malignant tumors of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and/or the skull base; and recieved definitive PBT (>60GyE) from January 1999 to December 2006.

The NSABP B-31 adjuvant trial suggested a possible clinical benefit for the addition of T to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors were Her-2 negative (low Her-2 expressing, non-amplified by FISH). ADCC mediated by CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells is known to play a role in response to T in Her-2 positive tumors. To investigate the possibility that T may induce ADCC against Her-2 negative tumors, we examined NK cell-mediated ADCC in T-treated, non-amp, low Her-2 expressing BC cell lines. Methods', ' A membrane/cytosol separation kit and immunoblotting were used to assess surface Her-2 levels in the non-amp BC cell lines CAMA-1, T47D, EFM19, MCF-7 and CAL-51. The positive control for Her-2 expression and amplification was HCC1954 and MDA-MB-468 was the negative control. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of 8 healthy volunteers using a Ficoll-Plaque method. CD56+ NK cells were isolated from the PBMC fraction using magnetic bead based positive selection. Direct NK activity against the K562 cell line and the ability of the NK cells to induce T-related ADCC were measured using flow cytometry. Results', ' Membrane expression of Her-2 was detected in all cell lines examined except the MDA-MB-468 cell line. The direct cytotoxicity of NK cells ranged from 42% to 73% (ratio 10', '1, NK', ' K562). T induced a significant ADCC response in the positive control HCC1954 (p value 0.002) and in each of the five non-amp, low Her-2 expressing cell lines, but not in the negative control MDA-MB-468 (Table). Conclusions', ' These results suggest that Her-2 non-amp BC cells, with low but detectable levels of Her-2 protein, can bind T and initiate ADCC.

        "Background":"['3,3’-diindolylmethane (DIM) and its halogenated derivatives (ring-DIMs) are recently shown to induce protective autophagy in human prostate cancer cells. The mechanism of induction of autophagy by DIM has not been elucidated. As DIM is a mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor, we hypothesized that DIM and ring-DIMs induce autophagy via alteration of AMP/ATP ratio and activation of AMPK signaling in prostate cancer cells. Autophagic activity was monitored by LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion in LNCaP and C42B prostate cancer cells. Autophagic vacuoles were examined using Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Protein levels for AMPK, pAMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), pACC, AEG-1, pULK-1 and β-actin were measured by western blot. AMPK and AEG-1 gene expression was downregulated using siRNA. DIM and ring-DIMs induced autophagy by increasing autophagic vacuoles and LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion in LNCaP and C42B cells. These compounds also induced AMPK, ULK-1 and ACC phosphorylation in a time dependent manner. Interestingly, DIM, 4,4’ dibromoDIM and 7,7’ dichloroDIM induced the oncogenic protein AEG-1 time dependently in LNCaP and C42B cells. Downregulation of AEG-1 or AMPK inhibited DIM- and ring-DIM-induced autophagy. Pretreatment with ULK1 inhibitor MRT 67307 or siRNAs targeting AEG-1 or AMPK potentiated the cytotoxicity of DIM and ring-DIMs. Interestingly, downregulation of AEG-1 induced senescence in cells treated with toxic concentrations of DIM or ring-DIMs, and inhibited the onset of apoptosis in response to DIM or ring-DIMs. In summary, we identified a novel mechanism for DIM- and ring-DIM-induced protective autophagy, via induction of AEG-1 and activation of AMPK. Our findings could help towards the development of novel drug therapies for prostate cancer that include selective autophagy inhibitors as adjuvants.']",

        "Background":"['PurposeNeuropilin-1 (Nrp1) was initially characterized as a guide for migrating cells and axons in developing nervous systems and is essential for the precise formation of neurons and vasculature. However, it was recently reported to also play an important role in the immune system. This study aimed to investigate the role of Nrp1 on monocytes in trastuzumab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) targeting the HER2-positive human breast cancer cell line SKBR3. In addition, we evaluated the gene expression profile of monocytes expressing high and low levels of Nrp1.MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were prepared using BD Vacutainer CPT Cell Preparation Tubes. The cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD14 and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-Nrp1 antibodies, and Nrp1high and Nrp1low monocyte subsets were sorted using FACSAria. These cells were used as effector cells in a conventional ADCC assay with SKBR3 as target cells and trastuzumab as the antibody. Target cell cytotoxicity was measured using the LDH cytotoxic test kit. The effector cell to target cell ratios of 20', '1 and 10', '1 were used. Gene expression analysis was performed by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. All study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan (authorization number G424).ResultsThe LDH cytotoxic test revealed significantly higher target cancer cell cytotoxicity in sorted Nrp1high monocytes than in Nrp1low monocytes (75% vs. 45%, p<0.01). Trastuzumab-mediated ADCC was significantly suppressed by Nrp1 neutralization antibodies in a dose-dependent manner (Control arm 14.3%, Treatment arm 6%; p<0.01). Gene expression analysis revealed that 308 genes were up-regulated in the Nrp1high population, including monocyte-specific chemokine receptor and hematopoietic transcriptional factor.ConclusionThese results suggest that determination of Nrp1 expression can be used to classify monocytes as populations with and without cellular cytotoxic activity. Analysis of Nrp1 expression levels in monocytes can therefore be used to identify HER2-positive breast cancer patients for whom trastuzumab therapy will be less effective.']",

However, RTX resistance has evolved as one of the limiting factors of such therapy and the exact cause of this resistance is not well understood. C-terminal deletion mutations of CD20 may be one possible reason such resistance or for relapse (Mishima Y. et al, Blood Cancer Journal 2011). Obinutuzumab (GA101), a novel type II glycoengineered CD20 antibody of the IgG1 isotype, demonstrates superior cell death induction and its glyco-engineered Fc region has shown to cause significant enhanced ADCC (Mssner et al, Blood 2010; Niederfellner G. et al, Blood 2011). The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of GA101 as compared to RTX against RTX resistant cell lines (Raji-2R and Raji-4RH, generously supplied by M. Barth, MD, Roswell Park Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY) in-vitro. Methods', ' We evaluated the efficacy of GA101 against Raji (Burkitt Lymphoma), a RTX sensitive cell line (RSCL) and RTX resistant cell lines (RRCL), Raji-2R and Raji-4R (Barth M. et al, ASH 2010). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and incubated with dose escalation of GA101 (1-100 g/ml) for 24 hrs. Cell death was evaluated by staining with AnnexinV/7AAD using a standard kit (BD Biosciences) and flow-cytometry. B-Cell Leukemia-Lymphoma (BLL) U-698-M cells (CD20+) (DSMZ, Germany) were used as the positive control; whereas, Loucy cells (CD20) (T-ALL) (ATCC, Manhass, VA) were used as the negative control. Results', ' At 100 g/ml of GA101 when incubated for 24 hrs, Raji and U-698-M demonstrated 26.50.42% and 32.41.9% cell death, respectively. Cell death of the RRCL, Raji-2R and Raji-4RH, was 16.33.4% and 17.50.07% respectively, at 100 g/ml of GA101 at 24 hrs.

There was no significant change in cell death with any concentration of GA101 with the Loucy cell line. Conclusion', ' Based on these findings, GA101 is a promising novel CD20 antibody for the treatment of RTX resistant B-Cell Lymphomas and related B-Cell malignancies. Further studies are aimed to identify novel candidates that may increase the efficacy of GA101 against RTX resistant cell lines in-vitro and in-vivo.
