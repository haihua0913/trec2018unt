Defining the landscape of genetic alterations that participate in cancer transformation provides insight into the diversity of clinical responses observed to targeted treatments. Here, we identified concurrent mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressors TP53 and PTEN as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanomas harboring mutant V600EBRAF.Defects in TP53 function and PTEN loss occur in 17% and 12% of malignant melanomas respectively, rendering cells dependent on CHK1 to maintain normal cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that CHK1 inhibition increases sensitivity to a variety of alkylating agents and targeted therapies in V600EBRAF mutant, TP53/PTEN deficient cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Inhibition of CHK1 concurrently with the induction of either DNA damage or replication stress leads to mitotic catastrophe and cell death in our in vitro and in vivo models of TP53/PTEN deficient tumors. In the case of externally applied cellular stress from chemotherapeutics, our results suggest CHK1 inhibition may sensitise this genetically defined subset of melanomas to such treatments.Our results provide some insight into the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes observed when treating BRAF mutant melanomas with BRAF inhibitor and suggest a need for comprehensive screening of TP53 and PTEN inactivation in these patients.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' The BRAF gene is the most frequently mutated gene in malignant melanoma (MM). When mutated, it is associated with a more aggressive disease phenotype. Recently, intronic microRNA miR-3151 was identified in intron 1 of BAALC via deep-sequencing of MM samples. BAALC is reported to be the most upregulated gene in BRAF mutated melanoma. In acute myeloid leukemia, both high miR-3151 and BAALC are associated with poor survival. In addition, miR-3151 has direct leukemogenic activity via direct deregulation of TP53.Aims', \" To decipher miR-3151's role in MM carcinogenesis and to elucidate its relation with BRAF mutations.Methods/Results\", ' miR-3151 and TP53 expression levels were determined in MM patients (n=20). Indeed, patients with high miR-3151 had lower TP53 expression. To prove direct downregulation of TP53 by miR-3151, we stably expressed miR-3151 and antagomiR-3151 in MM cell lines (Mel-39, A375, MeWo). RT-PCR and Western blots confirmed downregulation of TP53 by forced miR-3151 expression and upregulation of TP53 by antagomiR-3151. Increased levels of miR-3151 led to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis by miR-3151, whereas antagomiR-3151 reduced cell growth and increased apoptosis. Concurrent Annexin/PI-staining revealed a reduction of cells in S and G2 phase in response to antagomiR-3151. Next, we determined the BRAF mutation status in the set of 20 MM patients and tested for a possible association with miR-3151 expression. BRAF mutated (BRAFmut) patients had a 5-fold higher miR-3151 expression compared to BRAF wild-type (BRAFwt) patients. To test whether BRAF mutations directly influence miR-3151, we performed si-mediated knock-down in BRAFmut cell lines (A375, Mel-39) and introduced the BRAF mutation into the BRAFwt cell line (MeWo) and then determined miR-3151 and TP53 expression. Silencing BRAF decreased miR-3151 expression and consequently increased TP53 expression, while introducing the BRAF mutation increased miR-3151 expression and decreased TP53 when compared to scramble control. Finally, as pharmacologic inhibition of aberrantly activated BRAF is a promising treatment approach for BRAFmut MM and as we had just identified miR-3151 as a downstream target of BRAF, we tested whether simultaneous knock-down of miR-3151 would add to the known effects of the BRAF inhibitor Zelboraf. The presence of antagomiR-3151 reduced the dose of Zelboraf required to achieve cell death by 60%.Summary / Conclusions', ' miR-3151 deregulates TP53 in MM patients, thereby increasing the proliferation of MM cell lines. AntagomiR-3151 reduced MM cell growth and increased apoptosis in vitro. High miR-3151 expression is associated with the presence of BRAF mutations in MM patients, which directly increases miR-3151 expression. Simultaneous treatment of BRAFmut cell lines with the BRAF inhibitor Zelboraf and antagomiR-3151 significantly reduced the IC50 of Zelboraf.']",

        "Background":"['Activation of CDK4 by amplification, increased expression of Cyclin D1 (CCND1) or reduced expression of the CDK inhibitor p16 (CDKN2A) can contribute to melanocyte transformation, indicating that CDK4 can act as an oncogene in melanoma. We have analyzed the frequency of gene copy number variations (CNV) in the CDK4 pathway and looked for associations of these alterations with patient survival to assess if CDK4 is a viable target for the treatment of human melanoma. In addition, we screened a panel of melanoma cells with a highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991) and performed gene expression and mutation analysis on these cells to explore possible genomic predictors of sensitivity.Genomic analysis revealed that 75% of primary melanomas had at least one CNV in the CDK4 pathway, with 55% showing a loss of CDKN2A. 28% of melanomas had two or more CNVs and melanomas with two or more CNVs involving CCND1 had worse overall survival (HR 5.56, P=0.02). From the cell line studies low CDKN2A mRNA expression, mutation or loss predicted sensitivity to PD-991 with 23 out of 27 mutant/loss cell lines being sensitive compared to only 3/7 wild type lines (p<0.03). Expression of CDK4, CCND1 or other cyclins or CDK-inhibitors did not predict sensitivity to PD-991. PD-991 induced an increase in both cell size and SA--galactosidase activity that is indicative of a senescent phenotype, and this was associated with cells having wild type p53. In summary, genomic alterations in the CDK4 pathway are frequent in melanoma and are associated with worse survival, particularly when melanomas harbor two or more CNVs involving CCND1. CDK4 inhibition induces a senescent phenotype in melanoma cells that is associated with loss of CDKN2A and wild type TP53. Taken together these data support evaluation of CDK4 inhibitors in melanoma and suggest that CDKN2A and TP53 maybe genomic predictors of sensitivity.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is one of the few cancer types where p53 is not often mutated. Cancers which have not mutated TP53, often attenuate p53 activity by affecting upstream regulators or downstream effectors of p53. As melanoma progresses, it by passes senescence, proliferates, and switches from a proliferative phenotype to a more invasive phenotype. We have found that invasive melanomas, characterized by high levels of the pro-invasive Wnt molecule, Wnt5A, express active p53. Conversely, melanomas with a more proliferative phenotype, characterized by increased MITF signaling and low Wnt5A expression, do not express active p53. We show that the expression of p53 appears to be controlled by Wnt5A, and this may occur via CAMKII. By Western blot, we have observed that more proliferative melanoma cells express a high molecular weight p53 (250 kDa). This high molecular weight p53 does not break down on an SDS-PAGE gel. Knocking down p53 in proliferative and invasive melanoma cells, using siRNA, decreases the high molecular weight band in the proliferative cells, and the 53 kDa band in the more invasive cells. When we over express HA-tagged p53 in proliferative cells, we see multiple bands for p53 by Western blot, including the high molecular weight bands, suggesting that p53 is being post-translationally modified in these cells. We confirmed that ubiquitination is involved in the formation of the high molecular weight p53, by treating proliferative cells with SMER3, an E3 ligase inhibitor. Following two hours of treatment, the high molecular weight p53 band decreased and this decrease persists for 16 h. Next, we transfected an E6 ligase into invasive melanoma cells, which express active p53. Expression of the E6 ligase increased the expression of the high molecular weight p53 band (250 kDa), but these cells also continued to express active p53 (53 kDa). To determine if ubiquitination is targeting p53 for degradation in proliferative cells, we treated invasive and proliferative cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Following treatment with MG132, p53 (53 kDa) increased in invasive cells, suggesting that p53 is degraded via the proteasome in these cells. However, when we treated proliferative cells with MG132 we did not see an increase in the high molecular weight band, suggesting that p53 is not being degraded via the proteasome in these cells. By immunofluorescence, we found that p53 is in the cytoplasm of proliferative cells, suggesting that ubiquitination may be playing a role in sequestration of p53 in proliferative cells. In invasive cells, p53 remains largely nuclear, and we demonstrate that this plays critical roles in response to therapy, counter-intuitively driving resistance, by allowing cells to undergo an adaptive stress response that we term pseudosenescence']",

More importantly, the toxicity and financial burden of receiving such therapy warrants a personalized, or precision medicine, approach to appropriate selection of treatment, thus molecular predictors of response may become as important as biomarkers such as PDL1 expression. Recently the high mutational burden of malignant melanoma was shown to be related to the degree of response to the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab, but mutational burden alone was not sufficient to predict benefit1. Another study has shown NRAS-mutant had a trend to superior outcomes compared with other cohorts in terms of response to therapy with anti-PD1 antibodies and progression-free survival2. Moreover, insight into the molecular evolution of melanoma was recently established3, wherein somatic mutations in oncogenes such as BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, or GNA11 occur early during progression and additional mutations of TERT, CDKN2A, TP53, and PTEN are seen in late-stage disease. To better evaluate the relationship of these mutations to immunotherapy response, our institution has profiled 95 patients with melanoma with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Of the 95 patients profiled, the most common mutations identified were BRAF (38%), NRAS (21%), TP53 (18%), PTEN (14%), TERT (9%), and CDKN2A (8%). We are presently conducting a retrospective analysis of these selected oncogenes as they relate to clinical responses, and intend to report disease outcomes (duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival) as they relate to checkpoint inhibition.']",

Methods', '  AJCC stage IV melanoma patients (n=18; different metastasis sites) plasma and  paired metastatic tumor tissues resected after blood draw were assessed.  The assay was performed on 2 ml filtered plasma.

To note known BRAFmt at multiple exons were detectable. Subsequently, matched tumor and plasma from 10 patients were analyzed. We found ctDNA mt in 8/10 cases (mt allele frequency of 0.1-19.1%).

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the leading cause of death from skin disease worldwide. It is an aggressive cancer that is often resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation-based therapy. The combination of a low survival rate in metastatic disease and lack of successful treatment options underscores the need to elucidate novel methods to target melanoma. More than 95% of human melanomas retain wild type p53, the protein responsible for maintaining genomic integrity; and HDMX, a negative regulator of p53 that neutralizes p53, has recently been found to be overexpressed in 65% of human cutaneous melanoma. These features suggest that targeting the p53-HDMX interaction in melanoma could not only restore the tumor suppressor function of p53, but also sensitize melanoma cells to treatment with conventional chemotherapeutic agents which rely on an intact p53 response. We have previously demonstrated that a hydrocarbon-stapled -helix based on the transactivation domain of p53 (SAH-p53-8) efficiently disrupts p53-HDM2 and p53-HDMX complexes allowing for p53 to induce apoptotic cell death. Here, we show that SAH-p53-8 treatment is cytotoxic to metastatic melanoma cells by a p53-dependent mechanism. Additionally, SAH-p53-8 sensitizes melanoma to treatment with either cisplatin or the HDM2-specific inhibitor Nutlin-3. Importantly, the inhibition of the p53-HDMX complex arrests the growth of human metastatic melanoma in vivo.

Methods', ' Retrospective analysis of 1054 pts with melanoma treated with anti-PD-1/L1, resulting in 57 pts with unresectable or metastatic DM. Available baseline biopsies were analysed by digital quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD8 and PD-L1 and by whole exome sequencing (WES), compared to available tissue from non-DM pts treated with anti-PD1/L1 at UCLA. Results', ' At a median follow up of 20 mo, 40 pts (70%, 95% CI 57-82) had an objective response by RECIST 1.1 criteria, including 18 (45%) CRs with no relapse observed to date. Responses were similar in DM subsets (23 pure, 29 mixed and 5 indeterminate). Kaplan-Meier estimated 1-year and 2-year overall survival were 85% (95% CI 78-98) and 74% (95% CI 64-89). WES revealed a median of 1282 (interquartile range 517-1692) non-synonymous somatic mutations per tumor in DM tumors (n = 17), significantly higher (p = 0.02) than the median of 462 (interquartile range 230-1150) in non-DM (n = 23).

No genetic mechanisms known to cause constitutive PD-L1 expression were detected in these samples. Conclusions', ' Patients with advanced DM derive significant clinical benefit from PD-1/L1 inhibitors, likely related to the high mutational burden and a highly active adaptive immune response as the main mechanism of immune escape prior to therapy.

Limited therapies are available for advanced stages; therefore, there is a need for development of new treatments for melanoma.Honokiol is a plant lignan extracted from the magnolia bark tree. Studies from our laboratory showed its chemopreventive effects in a UVB-induced skin cancer model, as well as in vitro pro-apoptotic effects in A431 squamous cancer cells, UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 human melanoma cell lines. In this study, the antineoplastic effects of honokiol were evaluated in vivo against the malignant melanoma cell lines UACC-62 that harbors mutated BRAF, CDK4i, PTEN and SKMEL-2 cells that presents NRAF, and TP53 mutated genes.The present study investigated the mechanism of honokiol-induced antitumoral effects in human melanoma UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 cells in two xenograft melanoma models in mice.UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 melanoma cells were subcutaneously grafted in nude mice, treatment groups received honokiol 50 mg/kg thrice a week and tumor growth was followed. After five to seven weeks, animals were euthanized and tumor tissue collected for gene profiling and western blots. The genetic expression of apoptotic biomarkers was assessed by qRT-PCR by using PCR arrays for the apoptotic pathway (SABiosciences, CA).After subcutaneous grafting of UACC-62 or SKMEL-2 human melanoma cells in the nude mice, the intraperitoneal administration of honokiol at 50 mg/kg body weight for five to seven weeks caused a significant reduction of tumor growth. Honokiol activated the apoptotic pathway in UACC-62 cells xenograft tumors in mice, as attested by the significant up-regulation of BAK1, BAX, CARD8, CASP10, CASP2, CASP6, CASP7, FADD, TNFRSF10B, TNFRSF25, TP53 and TP53BP2 transcripts. In the western blots from the UACC-62 cells tumors, there was an increase in the expression of CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, CASP6, cleaved CASP6 and CASP10 proteins in the honokiol treated group. In the tumors originated from the SKMEL-2 melanoma cells, a significant up-regulation of BAD, BAK1, BAX, NOD1, CARD6, CASP7, FADD, TNFRSF21 and TRAF3 transcripts was observed.

The heterogeneity and the invasiveness of melanomas present notable challenges for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, several mutations in RAF, RAS, and PTEN were identified that allow for prognosis of cancer development and progression. Therefore, inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway form attractive candidates for molecular-based targeted treatment of melanoma cancer. Here, we present the molecular characterization and chemosensitivity profiling of 18 human melanoma cell lines. Eight of these were established by Oncotest from human tumor xenografts originally derived from primary patient material. The molecular profiling included mutational analysis for BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and PTEN by sequencing. The chemosensitivity profiles were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and included commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of melanoma, targeted agents (sorafenib and bortezomib) and various BRAF (PLX-4032, PLX-4720, GDC-0879) and MEK (CI-1040, PD0325901) inhibitors. The clinically relevant BRAF V600E substitution was the most prevalent mutation and was found in more than 50% of the melanoma cell lines. The chemosensitivity profiling revealed diverse patterns of selectivity and potency with mean IC50 values between 0.4 nM (vinblastine) and 8.3 M (carboplatin). Each of the BRAF inhibitors tested was clearly more active in melanoma cell lines carrying a BRAF mutation. On average, IC50 values of BRAF inhibitors were more than 20-fold lower for the BRAF V600E mutated cell lines compared to the wild type cell lines. However, the BRAF mutated cell line MEXF 462NL was resistant towards BRAF inhibitors and it is warranted to compare its gene expression profile and mutational status with BRAF mutated cell lines responding to BRAF inhibitors. By using an ex vivo clonogenic assay, similar activity patterns for BRAF inhibitors were found, with mutated BRAF tumor xenografts showing markedly higher sensitivity. Potential synergistic activity of BRAF inhibitors with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or with standard chemotherapeutic agents will be presented. The mutational status of selected cancer related genes, as well as responsiveness towards many cytotoxic and targeted agents was analyzed for 18 melanoma cell lines. This extensive genotypic and phenotypic characterization makes this melanoma cell line panel a valuable tool for in vitro profiling of novel compounds, in particular inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway.']",

Expression of miR-18b was significantly suppressed in melanoma specimens and cell lines by virtue of hypermethylation, and was re-induced in melanoma cell lines following 5-AZA-deoxycytidine treatment. Lower levels of miR-18b expression in primary melanoma were associated with significantly reduced overall survival. MDM2 was identified as a target of miR-18b action, as miR-18b significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of a reporter plasmid containing the 3UTR sequence of MDM2 complementary to the miR-18b seed sequence. Induction of miR-18b expression in melanoma cells resulted in reduced MDM2 expression, upregulation of p53 as well as PUMA and p21, and suppression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 and BCL-XL genes, resulting in significant suppression of melanoma cell proliferation. The effects of miR-18b overexpression on the p53 pathway and on melanoma cell growth were reversed by MDM2 overexpression. Stable overexpression of miR-18b produced potent tumor suppressor activity, as evidenced by suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and reduced tumor cell growth in vivo. In addition, miR-18b overexpression suppressed melanoma cell migration and invasiveness, and reversed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in melanoma cell lines. Our results demonstrate a novel role for miR-18b as a tumor suppressor in melanoma, identify the MDM2-p53 pathway as a target of miR-18b action, and suggest miR-18b overexpression as a novel strategy to reactivate the p53 pathway in human tumors.']",

This pathway is deregulated in 90% of melanomas, through amplification or increased expression of CDK4 or Cyclin D1 (CCND1), or reduced expression of the CDK inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2A).To explore if CDK4 may be a viable target for the treatment of human melanoma we screened a panel of melanoma cell lines with the highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991). A majority of cell lines were found to be sensitive to PD-991, although there was a distinct population of resistant cell lines. In sensitive melanoma cell lines, treatment with PD-991 resulted in loss of hyperphosphorylated RB and a concomitant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Treated cells displayed an enlarged flattened morphology and an increase in SA--galactosidase staining compared to vehicle controls, indicative of cellular senescence. RB-null cell lines were resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition, and did not display cell cycle arrest or senescence. Expression and mutational analysis was performed to identify additional genomic predictors of sensitivity and resistance. Loss of CDKN2A/p16 correlated with sensitivity to PD-991 (p<0.02), and this was confirmed at the level of protein expression. Mutation of p53 and the corresponding low expression of p53 targets p21 and MDM2 correlated with resistance (p<0.0001). There was no increase in p53 transcriptional targets or evidence of apoptosis in response to PD-991 treatment of sensitive cells, and senescence occurs in both p53 WT and mutant cells, indicating that this response does not require functional p53. However, in p53 WT cells, combination treatment with PD-991 and the p53 pathway activator Nutlin3a results in increased sensitivity to PD-991 compared to treatment with PD-991 alone. This additive effect is not observed in p53 mutant cells, suggesting there is a functional role for WT p53 in the response to PD-991.Conclusions', ' These preliminary data identify RB, p16 and p53 as predictors of response to PD-991, and support further evaluation of CDK4/6 inhibitors in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer implicated in tumor evolution and resistance to therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie genomic instability are still poorly understood. One common feature of cancer cells is an elevated genomic content (polyploidy) which is also associated with the acquisition of therapy resistance. Here we demonstrate a link between genomic instability and polyploidization in melanoma cells. We show that polyploidy induced by treatment with small molecule inhibitors of various mitotic kinases, such as AURKA, AURKB and PLK1, leads to DNA damage in cells with elevated (>4n) DNA content. This DNA damage results from replication stress exacerbated by limited activation of p53 in malignant melanocytes. Pharmacological induction of p53 in polyploid cells using an MDM2 antagonist reduced DNA damage by blocking re-replication of the polyploid genome as a result of p53-mediated p21 activation and transactivation of DNA repair genes. Notably we found that p21 blockade using siRNA knockdown or genetic knockout shifted polypoid cell response to p53 activation from cytostatic to cytotoxic. As a result, p21-deficient cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to mitotic blockade combined with p53 induction. Furthermore, TCGA dataset analysis showed poor progression free survival in melanoma patients with high p21 protein expression. These data argue for administering mitotic inhibitors and MDM2 antagonists, which are currently in clinical development, in conjunction with agents that target p21. In summary, our data here reveal that polyploidization can be a mechanism for induction of DNA damage and genomic instability associated with drug resistance in cancer and suggest a novel strategy for targeting these pathways to improve melanoma therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Malignant melanomas are notorious for their resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments. Thus the development of new therapeutic strategies that will allow overcoming drug resistance is essential. We have previously shown that Aurora A kinase (AurkA) inhibitor Alisertib (MLN8237) inhibited melanoma cell grouth by blocking mitosis and inducing senescence. In this study we used melanoma patients tissue specimens implanted under the skin of athymic mice and mouse melanoma tumors grown in immune-competent mice. Treatment with Alisertib inhibited melanoma tumor growth in both model systems. However, most of tumors re-grew after the treatment was paused and some of them acquired resistance to a second round of chemotherapy. Interestingly mouse melanoma cells collected from chemo-resistant tumors retained their resistance to Alisertib treatment when re-implanted into new hosts. In order to gain understanding of the molecular events facilitating Alisertib resistance we performed whole transcriptome sequencing in mouse melanoma tumors. Each Alisertib-treated tumor showed a large number of genomic alterations with the number of single nucleotide variations in protein-coding transcripts ranging from 807 to 2036. In total 613 genes were affected across 6 analyzed samples and among those, 253 genes carried nucleotide variations exclusively in drug resistant tumors. In silico pathway analysis revealed a statistically significant enrichment of this resistance-associated gene set with genes involved in cell cycle regulation (p<0.0001). Among those were important regulators of cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair and DNA damage response such as p53, Sesn3, TSC2, Camk2d, Lig1, Usp19, Slbp, Dgkz and Rpl24. This data together with our previous findings that that Alisertib induces polyploidy and subsequent activation of DNA damage response suggests that endoreduplication (DNA re-replication after failed mitosis) may promote the development of chemo-resistance in melanomas. We also found that Alisertib-induced endoreduplication can be blocked through activation of endogenous p53. Treatment with inhibitor of p53 degradation, Nutlin-3, significantly reduced Alisertib-associated polyploidy by inhibiting Rb phosphorylation and expression of genes involved in DNA replication licensing. This coincided with a decrease in phosphorylation levels of DNA-damage sensor histone H2AX and effector kinase Chk2. Notably, co-treatment with Nutlin-3 neither rescued melanoma cells from cytostatic effect of Alisertib treatment nor reversed Alisertib-induced senescence. Our findings suggest that pharmacological activation of endogenous p53 in combination with AurkA inhibitors could block endoreduplication-related genomic instability and potentially delay the development of drug resistance in melanoma tumors.

        "Background":"['IntroductionInactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor, a negative regulator of oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling, occurs in a subset of melanomas and is correlated with disease progression, treatment resistance and reduced patient survival. PTEN loss of function in melanoma is thought to result largely from gene deletion, mutation and/or methylation. However, the low frequency of these genomic alterations cannot explain the higher rate of loss of PTEN protein expression that is observed in melanoma. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that loss of PTEN expression in melanoma might be the consequence of predominantly non-genomic mechanisms, including post-transcriptional and post-translational dysregulation. Specifically, we postulated that PTEN loss in some melanomas might result from aberrant expression of PTENP1, a PTEN pseudogene-derived long non-coding RNA, and from increased PTEN ubiquitination and hence protein degradation.Experimental ProceduresWe performed an integrated analysis of data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 276) and metastatic melanoma human specimens from patients enrolled at NYU (n = 48). We examined the frequency of PTEN copy number loss using genomic qPCR, PTEN mutations using targeted sequencing and qPCR mutation arrays, and PTEN methylation status was determined in tumors lacking PTEN deletion or mutation with bisulfite treatment and pyrosequencing. Furthermore, we assessed PTEN and PTENP1 expression in tumor samples by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.ResultsComplete PTEN deletions were found in 8% of TCGA cases and in 10% of NYU cases, while partial PTEN deletions were detected in 27% of NYU cases. Somatic PTEN mutations were found in 8% of TCGA cases and 3% of NYU cases. The frequency of PTEN methylation at five CpG islands ranged between 0% and 28% and did not predict PTEN protein expression, thus identifying a subset of tumors that exhibit PTEN protein loss despite a lack of detectable PTEN deletions, mutations or methylation. Integration of PTEN and PTENP1 expression data from TCGA and the NYU cohort revealed a strong positive correlation between PTEN and PTENP1 levels in melanoma. Analysis of a role for aberrant PTEN ubiquitination in promoting PTEN loss in melanoma is ongoing.ConclusionsOur data challenge the existing model in which PTEN loss in melanoma is thought to occur primarily as a result of gene deletion, mutation or methylation. Rather, we find that these are uncommon events in melanoma and that PTEN loss may instead be attributed to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms, such as dysregulation by loss of the PTENP1 long non-coding RNA. A comprehensive understanding of these non-genomic processes could identify novel approaches (PTEN-restoring therapy) to block tumor progression and improve treatment responses and patient survival, suggesting that suppression of PTEN levels in melanoma might be reversible and thus could be exploited clinically.']",

Evidence is accumulating that miRNAs are involved in almost all aspects of tumor biology including tumor cell survival, proliferation and migration. Here, we report that miRNA-211, which maps to the sixth intron of TRPM1 gene (a suppressor of melanoma metastasis), is highly expressed in primary melanocytes and its expression is reduced in primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines. Expression of miRNA-211 correlates with expression of TRPM1, a transient receptor potential family member calcium channel protein that we showed to be involved in regulation of melanocyte calcium homeostasis and melanin pigmentation. Inhibition of miRNA-211 expression by anti-miR211 inhibited intercellular Ca+2 update and the growth of rapidly growing melanocytes. Ectopic expression of miRNA-211in melanoma cells inhibit growth and reduced their migration. Regulation of miRNA-211 and its function in melanocytes and melanoma have not been well understood. We show that ectopic expression of p53 (a tumor suppressor) in melanocytes increase miRNA-211 expression and decrease TRPM1 expression. Inhibition of miRNA-211 did not change TPRM1 expression in melanocytes. Additionally, we show that 1.4 kb intron 6 genomic region of TRPM1 which contain miRNA-211 region is sufficient to activate miRNA-211 expression. And 1.4 kb of 6th intron luciferase reporter plasmid transfection followed by luciferase assay showed increase in promoter driven luciferase activity.

However, despite impressive initial responses, therapeutic effects are often temporary due to acquired resistance. This resistance highlights the need to identify therapeutic approaches to improve the durability of responses to RAF inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel inhibitor of p53-Mdm2 interaction, NVP-CGM097, causes marked reduction of melanoma cell viability. The activation of p53 signaling and consequent reduction in cell viability required wild-type p53, but was independent of BRAF status. Moreover, combined inhibition of Mdm2, using NVP-CGM097, and BRAF using NVP-LGX818, synergistically inhibited the viability of BRAF mutant melanoma cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. NVP-CGM097 caused induction of p21 and Bax, while NVP-LGX818 did not. Instead, NVP-LGX818 caused induction of p27 and Bim. Therefore, together they induced a complementary set of anti-proliferative and apoptosis stimulating molecules, which resulted in strong synergistic antitumor effects. In vivo, the combination treatment resulted in sustained tumor regressions and markedly prolonged survival relative to either single agent. Collectively, these data show that activation of p53, through inhibition of Mdm2, leads to antitumor effects in melanoma. Furthermore, the data show that concomitant activation of tumor suppressor p53 and inhibition of BRAF synergistically suppresses melanoma growth. Therefore, combined inhibition of Mdm2 and BRAF in melanoma may provide an effective therapeutic modality capable of overcoming the resistance observed with the BRAF inhibitor monotherapy and thus lead to more durable responses in the clinic.']",

Melanoma is unusually lethal as it metastasizes early and is highly resistance to all available chemotherapeutics. The newest treatment utilizes a small inhibitor targeting the BRAF pathway, considering the BRAF V600E mutation occurs in 65% of clinical melanoma cases. Unfortunately, it is clear that there is both primary and acquired resistance to the drug. Recent studies demonstrate that engaging defective cell surface adhesion receptors known as integrins increases the sensitivity of melanoma to traditional DNA damaging agents. Our laboratory has identified a novel peptide denoted vinculin activating peptide (VAP) that increases integrin engagement from within the cell by targeting the integrin cytoplasmic binding partner, vinculin. Furthermore, VAP sensitizes melanoma to DNA damaging agents in vitro and in vivo. The goal of this project is to identify the cell surface target of VAP. Both 1and 3 integrins are highly over-expressed in melanoma, suggesting that VAP targets one or both of these defective integrins. To test this possibility, melanoma cells lacking 1 or 3 integrins were generated. In the absence of 1 integrins, VAP did not induce elevations in p53 levels or increase apoptosis in melanoma cell lines treated with cytotoxic agents. In addition, its ability to sensitize melanoma cells to therapeutics in biological assays was ablated. Furthermore, the 1 integrin-dependency of VAP's effect was confirmed by examining melanoma cells lacking 3 integrins. Ongoing experiments are testing the requirement for 1 integrin in mouse models of melanoma. Taken together, these findings suggest that 1 integrins are required for VAP to sensitize melanomas to chemotherapy agents. The successful completion of these studies will provide the mechanistic underpinning for a new class of therapeutics that sensitize melanomas to chemotherapy.\"]",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is a lethal form of cutaneous cancer which accounts for 80% of skin cancer deaths owing to its highly metastatic behavior and few clinically effective therapies. More than 60% of melanoma patients present with mutations in B-Raf, a serine/threonine kinase that increases proliferation and survival through the constitutive activation of ERK signaling. Inhibition of mutated B-Raf with specific inhibitors like vemurafenib reduces tumor growth and extends patient survival. However, clinical responsiveness to vemurafenib is limited in most melanoma patients, prompting analysis of additional pathways that could be targeted to extend vemurafenib responsiveness or overcome resistance. Towards this goal, we examined the impact of vemurafenib on substrates or cascades activated in B-Raf mutant and wild-type melanoma cells. We were particularly interested in assessing the impact of mutant B-Raf inhibition on deubiquitinases (DUBs), which are overexpressed or activated in many tumor types. DUBs control the stability, activity and localization of multiple proteins and are emerging as therapeutic targets. We found that vemurafenib treatment or lentiviral-mediated B-Raf knockdown reduced the activity of several DUBs in B-Raf mutant melanoma cells, including Usp9x, Usp14 and Usp5. These DUBs were not affected by vemurafenib in w/t B-Raf-expressing cells. Interestingly lentiviral-mediated knockdown of Usp5, but not Usp9x, reduced melanoma growth and increased vemurafenib sensitivity whereas Usp5 overexpression suppressed vemurafenib activity. Inhibition of Usp5 activity by vemurafenib or by Usp5 shRNA KD alone had little effect on melanoma cell apoptosis. However B-Raf inhibition in Usp5 KD cells resulted in >5-fold increased melanoma cell apoptosis. Further, Usp5 KD increased accumulation of p53 and p53-related proteins as well as their transcriptional targets. Our data clearly shows that mutant B-Raf activates Usp5 to suppress apoptotic responsiveness to vemurafenib and kinase inhibition alone was not sufficient to completely suppress Usp5 activity. Silencing studies demonstrate that Usp5 inhibition will enhance cell killing in response to B-Raf inhibition in melanoma. To address that potential, we compared anti-tumor activity in mice treated with vemurafenib and a small molecule DUB inhibitor, WP1130, with activity against Usp5. Treatment with either agent alone reduced tumor growth while mice receiving both vemurafenib and WP1130 had enhanced anti-tumor responses. Together, these results suggest that mutant B-Raf activates Usp5 activity to suppress p53 induction and apoptotic responsiveness to vemurafenib.

        "Background":"['Melanoma, a potentially lethal form of skin cancer, is the fifth most common type of new cancer diagnosis in American men and the sixth most common type in American women. Alarmingly, the annual incidence of melanoma among whites has increased steadily (>60% over the past 30 years). Despite new developments in therapy, the overall survival of patients with advance-stage melanoma has not significantly improved. Therefore, concerted mechanism-based efforts are needed for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of this deadly neoplasm. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to melanoma development and progression can be useful in crafting new strategies for melanoma management. We are studying the role of sirtuin family of proteins in melanoma development and progression. Mammalian sirtuins (SIRT 1-7) are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylases, which have been shown to regulate metabolism, stress responses, and longevity, in model organisms. The role of sirtuins in cancer is fairly complex with dichotomous functions (tumor promoter versus tumor suppressor) depending on cell contexts. SIRT3 is a mitochondrial deacetylase that has been shown to be important in maintaining cellular metabolism by regulating mitochondrial functions. We have previously shown that SIRT3 was overexpressed in human melanoma cells and tissues and its inhibition resulted in an antiproliferative response in human melanoma cells (In', ' AACR Annual Meeting', ' Proceedings; 2013 April 6-April 10, Washington, DC; Abstract # 13-LB-9391). In this study, we found that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of SIRT3 in SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells resulted in 1) G1-phase arrest of cell cycle, 2) induction of senescence as assessed by increase in senescence-associated -galactosidase (SA--gal) activity, 3) senescence associated hetrochromatin formation (SAHF), 4) decrease in cell migration, and 5) increase in protein levels of p53, phospho-p53 (Ser15), p21Waf1, pRb and p16INK4a. Further, a stable exogenous overexpression of SIRT3 resulted in an increase in cell growth and clonogenic survival in Hs 294T melanoma cells. Based on our data we suggest that SIRT3 could be a contributing factor in melanoma survival. However, further extensive in-vitro and in- vivo studies are needed to ascertain the functional significance of SIRT3 in melanoma development and progression.']",

        "Background":"['Cutaneous melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer, with ~76,380 newly diagnosed melanoma and ~10,130 melanoma-associated deaths per year in the US. Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and more effective targeted therapies for this devastating disease. The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type. This landmark study highlighted the important role of the previously understudied NF1 tumor suppressor in melanoma pathogenesis, especially for the 9% of melanoma patients who have acquired inactivating NF1-mutations, but lack hotspot mutations that activate BRAF or RAS. To date, animal models have not been developed for the NF1-mutant subtype of melanoma, which has significantly impaired the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this subtype. Here we report the first zebrafish model for NF1-mutant melanoma, which we generated by combining the loss of nf1 with loss of both pten and p53. The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas. Thus our model appears ideal for the testing of drugs that will prove uniquely active for the significant subset of NF1-mutant, BRAF/NRAS-wildtype human melanomas.']",

        "Background":"['Tumors cells are able to resist cell death and evade the immune system. This resistance can be caused by alterations in Trp53 itself or p19Arf loss and the reduced anti-tumor immune response may be caused by loss of interferon- (IFN), an important immune-stimulatory cytokine. Here, we investigate the impact of p19Arf and IFN gene transfer in melanoma cells with regards to the expression profile of genes responsible for the induction of cell death. Recombinant adenoviral vectors with a p53-responsive promoter (PG) driving expression of p19Arf or IFN were applied alone or in combination in B16F10 cells in vitro (mouse melanoma, p53 wt). Cell death was evaluated by annexin/PI staining and MTT assays. LC3B expression was verified by western blot analysis of cells extracts. Caspase-3 activity was evaluated using a lentiviral vector which constitutively expressing luciferase protein linked to an ubiquitin site that can be cleaved by caspase-3. RNA expression profile was evaluated by microarray analysis of treated samples and validation of gene expression was performed by real-time PCR. We verified that combined gene transfer of p19Arf and IFN resulted in 74% hypodiploid cells whereas single gene transfer yielded only half of this number, as shown by cell cycle and MTT analysis. Although there was a high rate of cell death, only 25% of cells were stained for annexin/PI and activation of caspase-3 was reduced in cells treated with p19Arf and IFN combination compared to treatment of p19Arf alone. Also, there was no increase in LC3B expression when cells were treated with the p19Arf and IFN combination. These observations suggest that B16F10 cells are dying by other mechanisms rather than apoptosis or autophagy. Transduced cells were analyzed for gene expression profile and critical genes were selected for validation. Combination of p19Arf and IFN transduction in B16F10 cells revealed a synergistic effect modifying exclusively the expression of 1054 genes involved in cell death, immune system activation and cell cycle arrest. There was an increase of 4-20 fold in expression of MDM2, p53, p21Waf1, PUMA, MDM4, FOXO1, NR3C1, PHLDA3, RANBP9 and WDR46, and also an increase of 400-fold in p73 expression in cells treated with p19Arf and IFN combination. Conclusions', ' The use of p53-responsive vectors to express p19Arf and IFN promotes complementation of the p53/Arf and IFN pathways, resulting in a synergistic gene regulation of many essential functions in cancer cells, destabilizing cell cycle and cell organization in general, while promoting expression of genes related to cell death. As p73 is a transcription factor of caspase-1 expression, we hypothesize that this could be the major participant involved in death of these cells.Financial support', ' 2011/10656-5, 2011/50911-4 and 2013/25167-5 (FAPESP).']",

        "Background":"['Vascularization of tumors promotes not only their survival and growth, but also facilitates metastases from primary to distant sites. For that reason, understanding the molecular determinants controlling tumor angiogenesis is mandatory to develop clinically efficacious angiogenesis inhibitors for cancer therapy. Melanoma differentiation associated gene or mda-9, also known as syntenin, is a multifunctional scaffold protein that cross talks with a plethora of proteins and regulates diverse physiological and pathological processes, including tumor progression and metastasis. Since, tumor angiogenesis promotes metastasis, we hypothesized that in addition to augmenting invasion and migration, MDA-9/Syntenin might also promote angiogenesis thereby facilitating tumor progression and metastasis.Genetic (gain-of-function and loss-of-function) and pharmacological approaches were employed to modify mda-9/syntenin expression in normal immortal melanocytes, early radial growth phase melanoma and metastatic melanoma cells. The consequence of modifying mda-9/syntenin expression on angiogenesis was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo assays, including tube formation assays using human vascular endothelial cells, chicken choriallantoic membrane assays (CAM assays) and xenograft tumor animal models.Employing both genetic and chemical approaches we now demonstrate that MDA-9/Syntenin expression correlates with in vitro and in vivo (tumorigenic/metastatic) transformed/invasive phenotypes of human melanoma. Additionally, our immunohistochemical and in vivo CAM assays confirm that angiogenesis is an essential component of MDA-9/Syntenin-induced tumor progression. To define how MDA-9/Syntenin regulates angiogenesis we identified and analyzed several potential downstream gene targets of MDA-9/Syntenin. One gene implicated in induction of vasculogenesis is insulin growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which is transcriptionally regulated by hypoxia inducible factor-1 as a consequence of MDA-9/Syntenin and Src interaction. IGFBP-2 transcriptionally regulates VEGF-A in an AKT-dependent manner through interaction with V3 integrin resulting in angiogenesis.Our studies delineate an unanticipated cell non-autonomous function of MDA-9/Syntenin in the context of angiogenesis by augmenting expression of several pro-angiogenic factors including IGFBP-2, which may provide a complementary way to promote metastasis. As a result, targeting MDA-9/syntenin or its downstream-regulated molecules may provide a means of simultaneously impeding metastasis by both directly inhibiting tumor cell transformed properties (autonomous) and indirectly by blocking angiogenesis (non-autonomous).']",

Nestin was detected in various neoplasms, and its expression level has relevance to the poor prognosis in some tumors, including malignant melanomas. Recently, nestin was reported as one of the cancer stem cell markers in melanomas. Furthermore, nestin is expressed in circulating tumor cells of melanoma patients, and its expression was found to be correlated with the prognosis. These reports indicate that nestin plays important roles in melanomas, and has the possibility of becoming a therapeutic target in melanomas. In the present study, we used a silencing strategy of nestin to clarify the effectiveness of nestin-targeting therapy in malignant melanomas. METHODS', ' We constructed a plasmid vector of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) tageting nestin and scramble vector as a negative control. Human malignant melanoma cells, A375 cells, were stably transfected with these vectors. Using nestin-shRNA-transfected cells, scramble vector-transfected cells, and wild-type cells, we analyzed cell growth, sphere formation, and invasion in vitro. Activation of the AKT/MAPK pathway was analyzed using a phosphorylated protein array. To determine the effect of nestin-knockdown in vivo, we performed tail vein injection of transfected and wild-type A375 cells into nude mice, and analyzed the metastatic tumor formation in 5 weeks. RESULTS', ' Nestin shRNA transfection suppressed cell growth, invasion, and sphere formation of A375 cells in vitro. In the protein array, the suppression of nestin decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and p53. The incidence of liver metastasis in nude mice was 100% in wild-type cell-injected mice, 75% in scramble vector-transfected cell-injected mice, and 16.7% in nestin-shRNA-transfected cell-injected mice. CONCLUSION', ' These findings suggest that nestin regulates cell growth, stemness, invasion, and metastasis of melanomas, in part, by alterling the phosphorylation of the MAPK/AKT pathway.

We characterized the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles and efficacy of DS-3032b in a phase 1 trial. Methods', ' Using accelerated and Bayesian design in the dose-escalation phase of this 2-part study (part 1), we escalated DS-3032b from 15 to 240 mg orally once daily (QD) on a continuous or interrupted (QD 21/28 days) schedule. Results', ' Thirty-one of 34 pts enrolled in part 1 were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Median age was 59.5 years, 44% male, and 62% had  3 prior therapies.

Of 26 pts evaluable for efficacy, none had an objective response but 77% had stable disease (SD); consistent with cell cycle arrest/senescence seen in preclinical studies. Tumor shrinkage was seen but did not meet RECIST criteria. Two pts with previously progressing LPS and carcinoid remain on study for 26+ mos and tumor sequencing showed MDM2 gene amplification.

        "Background":"['Melanoma, one of the most lethal forms of skin cancer, remains resistant to available treatments. Unfortunately, current treatment options are insufficient for preventing the rapid metastasis and death associated with this disease. Thus, additional target-based approaches are needed for the management of this neoplasm. SIRT1, a member of mammalian sirtuin-family and a class III histone deacetylase has been implicated in several cancers. SIRT1 plays an important role in cell survival, as it is involved in DNA repair and inhibits apoptosis and cellular senescene in response to oxidative stress and DNA damage. It also favors cell survival through its regulation of the FOXO transcription factors and the tumor suppressor gene p53. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that i) histone deacetylase SIRT1 is expressed at much higher levels in melanoma cells than in normal human epidermal melanocytes, and ii) inhibition of SIRT1 through shRNA-mediated RNA interference or sirtinol-mediated activity inhibition resulted in decreased growth, viability, and clonogenic survival of melanoma cells (Nihal et al; In', ' AACR Annual Meeting', ' Proceedings; 2011 Apr 2-6, Orlando, FL Abstract # 1647). Here, in order to determine if SIRT1 is a viable target for melanoma management, we extended our studies to determine the effects of Tenovin-1, which is a more specific and efficient small molecule inhibitor of SIRT1, in multiple melanoma cell lines, representing different stages of disease progression. For this purpose, we employed i) A375 (primary and vertical-growth tumorigenic) and HS294T (metastatic and tumorigenic), both of which are amelanotic cell lines, and ii) G361 (metastatic and tumorigenic) melanin-producing cell line. We determined the effects of Tenovin-1 on the expression levels of SIRT1 protein in melanoma cells. Our data demonstrated that Tenovin-1 treatment resulted in a dose dependent decrease in the level of SIRT1 protein in all the melanoma cell lines tested. Further, we found that Tenovin-1 treatment resulted in a concentration dependent decrease in the growth and viability of melanoma cells, as shown by Trypan blue exclusion and MTT analyses. Furthermore, we found that Tenovin-1 caused an increase in protein level of the tumor suppressor p53 in a concentration-dependent fashion. Taken together, our results suggested that Tenovin-1 reduces melanoma cell growth via inhibition of SIRT1 and subsequent increase in p53 activity. However, additional studies are needed to confirm our results and to further establish the mechanism of how Tenovin-1 mediated SIRT1 inhibition leads to melanoma cell death. This includes the evaluation of other known SIRT1 targets such as the FOXO transcription factors. Finally, in vivo studies are also required to further determine the clinical relevance of our findings.']",

        "Background":"['Malignant melanoma is the most increasing form of cancer worldwide, in addition to being the second most common cancer in young adults. Whereas the prognosis is good when detected early, there are no curative treatments once the cancer has spread (stage IV). Thus, there is a precarious need for new and more effective treatment options. Since the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle is dysfunctional in the majority of human cancers, the G2/M transition has been a focus of attention for targeted therapy the recent years. The Wee1 kinase is a major regulator of the G2/M checkpoint, and may halt the cell cycle by adding a negative phosphorylation on CDK1 (Tyr15). Additionally, Wee1 has a function in safeguarding the genome integrity during DNA synthesis. To assess the role of Wee1 in the progression of malignant melanoma we examined its expression in a panel of paraffin-imbedded patient derived tissues of benign nevi, primary- and metastatic melanoma. We found that Wee1 expression increased in the direction of malignancy, and had a strong, positive correlation with known markers of proliferation', ' Cyclin A (p<0.0001), Ki67 (p<0.0001), Cyclin D3 (p<0.001), p21Cip1/WAF1 (p=00.3), p53 (p<0.025), thicker primary tumours (p=0.001), ulceration (p=0.005) and poor disease-free survival (p=0.008). Transfections using siWee1 in three metastatic melanoma cell lines; WM239WTp53, WM45.1MUTp53 and LOXWTp53, further support our hypothesis of a tumour promoting role of Wee1 in melanomas. Whereas no effect was observed in LOX cells, transfection with siWee1 led to accumulation of cells in G1/S and S phase of the cell cycle in WM239 and WM45.1 cells, respectively. Both latter cell lines displayed reduced viability (MTS analysis), DNA damage (-H2AX) and induction of apoptosis (DNA fragmentation, caspase 3- and PARP-cleavages), in the absence of Wee1. Thus, the effect of silencing Wee1 may not be solely dependent of the p53 status of the cells. Moreover, our preliminary results have demonstrated that combined inhibition of Wee1 using (Wee1 inhibitor II/681641) and MAPK/ERK signalling (PD98059) further enhanced the therapeutic effect, as compared to Wee1 silencing alone. Together these results reveal the importance of Wee1 as a prognostic biomarker in melanomas and indicate that targeting Wee1 alone or in combination with other targeted therapies or conventional radio- or chemotherapy may be a promising approach in the treatment of melanoma patients.']",

These findings are very encouraging, however the specific mechanisms of response and reasons why only a subset of patients respond to therapy are not known. The extraordinary potential of immune therapies in cancer suggests that human-relevant mouse models of cancer are required to understand mechanisms of response and to optimize therapy so that a larger proportion of patients respond.We have generated and evaluated a series of genetically engineered mouse models driven by alterations in Braf, Pten, Cdkn2a, beta catenin, p53, and Nras that reflect the genetic diversity of the vast majority of human melanoma. We have backcrossed 6 of these models to C57Bl/6, generated tumors, and isolated a series of over 20 congenic mouse melanoma cell lines. Several independent lines have been isolated for each melanoma genotype generated. Injection of these lines into C57Bl/6J mice results in reproducible tumor formation in the absence of co-injection of Matrigel. We are in the process of characterizing the tumor microenvironment in each of the models using flow cytometry and a novel quantitative imaging approach of histological sections, which produces flow cytometry-like data, but retains spatial and morphologic information that can be utilized to characterize much smaller tumors.

Ribosome biogenesis is inherently tied to protein synthesis, a process relied upon in cancer to sustain its increased proliferative properties. The ability to activate a tumor suppressor and simultaneously target a process heavily dependent upon for cancer growth is a promising therapeutic angle that deserves exploration. In the present study, we knocked down expression of all large subunit ribosomal proteins to examine their effect on melanoma growth. We found that targeting many ribosomal proteins lead to decreased cancer cell viability. siRNA mediated knocking down of RPL13, a representative ribosomal protein of this group, resulted in increased p53 expression and cell cycle arrest dependent on the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of protein synthesis in culture and decreased tumor growth by 50-90% in animals was observed upon knockdown of RPL13. We conclude that the cell cycle arrest is due in large part to the increased p53 expression caused by the binding of RPL5 and RPL11 to MDM2, however the inhibition of melanoma growth cannot be explained solely by an increase in the tumor suppressor. The accompaniment of decreased protein synthesis provides an additional mechanism contributing to decreased growth.

BRAF, MEK1 kinase inhibitors and CTLA4 antagonist have improved patient survival, but only a subset of patients respond or derived long-lasting clinical benefit, illustrating the need for discovery of additional targets and pathways that may be inhibited with small molecules. Given the clinical impact of inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in other cancers, we explored the potential for aberrant deubiquitinase (DUB) activity to play a role in the tumorigenic properties of melanoma. We also assessed whether specific DUBs play a role in apoptotic responsiveness and resistance to kinase inhibitors. Initially, we noted that the activity of several DUBs, including Usp9x and Usp5, was elevated in melanoma compared to normal melanocytes. Further, Usp9x and Usp5 expression and activity were up-regulated by expression of BRAFV600E in 293T cells and kinase inhibition partially suppressed both Usp9x and Usp5 activity in vemurafenib sensitive, but not resistant cells. Usp9x knockdown (KD) in BRAF mutant or wild-type melanoma did not affect 2-dimensional cell growth or survival but significantly amplified the apoptotic activity of BRAF or MEK1 inhibitors, respectively. Usp5 KD in melanoma suppressed cell growth by reinforced the S/G2-M checkpoint, enhanced extrinsic caspase activation through modulation of p53 and FAS levels and amplified the apoptotic activity of kinase inhibitors (and other chemotherapeutic agents) and overcame vemurafenib resistance in A375R cells. To further assess the clinical relevance of activated DUBs in melanoma, primary human melanoma explants characterized for their metastatic efficiency in patients and NSG mice demonstrated that Usp9x and Usp5 expression and activity were elevated in efficient metastasizers, but only a subset of inefficient metastasizers, suggesting a potential role for DUBs in the regulation of metastatic potential. To investigate that possibly, control and Usp9x KD cells were grown in Matrigel or suspension culture and colony growth and survival, as well as Usp9x activity were examined. Usp9x KD significantly suppressed melanoma colony growth and fully reduced survival of highly metastatic SK-Mel147 cells in 3D culture. Growth in 3D conditions resulted in activation of Usp9x, but also increased their sensitivity (IC50 <400 nM) to our partially selective Usp9x inhibitor, EOAI3402143 (G9). G9 inhibits both Usp9x and Usp5 activity and phenocopied the activities of both Usp9x and Usp5 KD cells. G9 was safely administered to NSG mice, with complete block of melanoma growth.

The current study aimed to investigate the WIP1 inhibitor GSK2830371 and MDM2-p53 antagonists (nutlin-3, RG7388 and HDM201) alone and in combination treatment in cutaneous melanoma cell lines and explored the mechanistic basis of these responses in relation to the genotype and induced gene expression profile of the cells. A panel of three p53WT (A375, WM35, C8161) and three p53MUT (WM164, WM35-R5R1, CHL-1) melanoma cell lines were used. GSK2830371 (≤10 μM) alone had no growth-inhibitory or cytotoxic effects on the cells, measured by sulforhodamine B (SRB) and clonogenic assays. In combination treatment GSK2830371 significantly potentiated the growth-inhibitory and clonogenic cell killing effects of MDM2 inhibitors in p53WT but not p53MUT melanoma cells, indicating the potentiation worked in a p53-dependent manner (Table). Western blotting demonstrated GSK2830371 increased p53 stabilization through Ser15 phosphorylation and consequent Lys382 acetylation when it was combined with MDM2 inhibitors. These changes were ATM-mediated, shown by reversal with the ATM inhibitor (KU55933). Furthermore, GSK2830371 was demonstrated to slow down p53 degradation when de-novo protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. In qRT-PCR, nutlin-3 or RG7388 induced p53 transcriptional target genes (CDKN1A, MDM2, BAX, FAS, PUMA, TNFBSF10B, TP53INP1) and GSK2830371 enhanced the induction in p53WT but not p53MUT cells. In conclusion, GSK2830371, a WIP1 inhibitor, at doses with no growth-inhibitory activity alone, potentiated the growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic activity of MDM2 inhibitors, by increasing phosphorylation, acetylation, and stabilization of p53 in cutaneous melanoma cells in a functional p53-dependent manner.

        "Background":"['Malignant melanoma is one of the most increasing forms of cancer worldwide, in addition to being notoriously resistant to therapy. Despite recent advances, there are no curative treatments once the cancer has spread (stage IV); there is thus a precarious need to find new and better treatment alternatives. Unlike normal cells, the majority of cancer cells have a defective G1/S DNA-damage checkpoint and are therefore more dependent on the G2/M checkpoint when DNA damages arise. Central in regulating the latter checkpoint is Wee1, a kinase which may stop the cell cycle by adding a negative phosphorylation on CDK1. Wee1 is regulated by Chk1 which upon DNA damage can also inhibit the complimentary counterpart of Wee1; CDC25. In recent studies, Wee1 and Chk1 have additionally been indicated as key players in regulating DNA replication in S-phase. We have previously reported that increased Wee1 protein expression was associated with malignancy in melanoma tumour samples, and that siWee1 transfection led to reduced viability in melanoma cell lines. In the present study we have combined inhibitors of Wee1 (MK1775) and Chk1 (AZD7762) in a panel consisting of both metastatic melanoma- and normal cells, including a Plexxikon resistant melanoma cell line (MelJR post3.3). We found that the combination synergistically reduced the amount of viable cells in the melanoma cell lines (50-80% reduction), whilst only having very moderate effect (10% reduction) in the normal cells. Interestingly, the reduction in number of viable cells was found in both p53WT and p53Mut cell lines, indicating that the p53 status do not predict the response to such treatment. Furthermore, combinational treatment with the inhibitors caused increased cleavage of PARP and caspases, indicative of apoptosis, as compared to MK1775 or AZD7762 treatment alone. The combination also caused a marked increase in DNA double-strand breaks, as demonstrated by augmented levels of -H2AX (predominantly found in S-phase cells). In line with this, preliminary results from melanoma cells grown as spheroids, revealed the same tendency, with approximately 50% reduction in spheroid volume when combining the inhibitors. In vivo experiments using melanoma cells grown in SCID mice are currently ongoing. In conclusion, our results indicate a potential new role for inhibitors of Wee1 and Chk1 in treatment of malignant melanoma.']",

The Wilms tumor protein 1 (WT1) is a transcription factor that has been associated with melanoma oncogenesis and proliferation, hence could be a target of tumor control procedures. A lysine-arginine rich peptide (WT1 pTj) based on WT1 C-terminal zinc finger domain was synthesized and tested for anti-proliferative effects on human and murine melanoma cell lines (A2058 and B16F10-Nex2, respectively), including inhibition of cell growth and colony formation, cell cycle arrest and induction of cell senescence. Internalization of WT1 pTj into A2058 cells was established by confocal microscopy, using biotinylated peptide and staining by streptoavidin-FITC. An effect on p53 activity was measured by a luciferase reporter assay. Competitive ELISA assay was performed to verify whether the peptide interferes with p53-WT1 interaction. In vivo, athymic nude mice and C57Bl/6 were inoculated with A2058 and B16F10-Nex2 cells, respectively, and treated for 5 consecutive days with C-amidated WT1 pTj. Here, we show that WT1 pTj decreased, in a dose and time dependent manner, the number of melanoma viable cells. The anti-proliferative activity of WT1 pTj was linked to an irreversible G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of senescence as suggested by positive staining for beta-galactosidase. Treatment with WT1 pTj reduced the total number of soft-agar colonies by A2058 melanoma cells. The peptide entered the cell within 15 minutes and was diffusely distributed throughout the cell, including the nucleus. Moreover, WT1 pTj enhanced p53 activity and competed with WT1 protein for binding to p53. In vivo, WT1 pTj reduced the number of lung nodules in the B16F10-Nex2 syngeneic model of metastatic melanoma and prolonged survival of mice in the A2058 subcutaneous xenograft model. In conclusion, WT1 pTj peptide entered cancer cells and promoted antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. The data support the hypothesis that WT1 pTj may prevent important interactions between WT1 protein and its partners via a zinc finger motif, inhibiting melanoma development. Therefore, WT1 pTj is a promising agent against WT1-expressing malignancies (e.g. MCF-7 but not SK-BR-3 breast cancer or normal human fibroblasts; and also HL60 acute myeloid leukemia). WT1 pTj may act also as a trojan carrier peptide for potential drug delivery. Supported by FAPESP grant 2010/51423-0 and the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq)']",

We previously reported that elephants have a lower than expected rate of cancer, 20 copies of TP53 (1 ancestral gene with introns [EP53-anc] and 19 retrogenes [EP53-retro1-19]), and increased p53-mediated apoptosis induced by DNA damage in elephant cells compared to human cells (Abegglen JAMA 2015). For the current study, we expressed various EP53 proteins in human cancer cells with different p53 status, including osteosarcoma (U2-OS, Saos-2), glioblastoma (T98G), and breast cancer (MCF7). Western blot analysis confirmed EP53 expression. We compared apoptosis in the human cancer cells transfected/transduced with negative control vectors vs. epitope or protein-tagged EP53 exposed to doxorubicin (to induce DNA damage). Apoptosis was measured by cell viability, caspase activity, Propidium Iodide/Annexin V staining, and fluorescence microscopy. We observed a significant increase in caspase activity (normalized to cell viability) of U2-OS and T98G cells expressing EP53 compared to negative control treated cells as shown in Table 1, and apoptosis with p21 restoration in Saos-2. In U2-OS, which overexpress MDM2, EP53 was more effective at inducing apoptosis compared to human TP53. Taken together, we found that EP53-anc restored p53-mediated apoptosis and EP53-anc / EP53-retro9 enhanced p53-mediated apoptosis. These data suggest for the first time that EP53 functions in human cancer cells to promote cell death. Ongoing efforts are exploring the EP53 mechanism of action that leads to increased apoptosis, including expression of EP53 in additional cancer types (lung, melanoma, colon, prostate, and others) with a variety of genetic backgrounds to characterize its functional context.

JAK-STAT signal is one of the main pathways involved in the tumor growth in melanoma, because JAK inhibitor has been reported to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family proteins are important negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine signals by suppressing JAK-STAT signal pathway via inhibiting JAK activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of SOCS-1 in the proliferation of melanoma through regulating cytokine signaling pathway and to clarify the mechanisms of its antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS ', ' Adenovirus vectors encoding SOCS1 gene was used to overexpress SOCS1 in three melanoma cell lines (G361, SK-MEL5, and SK-MEL28). The status of activated kinases and downstream proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. Anti-proliferative effects in melanoma cells were assessed by MTT assay. Apoptosis in melanoma cells was assessed by Caspase 3 activity and TUNEL staining. ICR nu/nu mice were used for subcutaneous xenograft experiment. RESULTS ', \" High levels of phosphorylated STAT3 in G361 and SK-MEL5, but not in SK-MEL28. Overexpression of SOCS1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in G361 and SK-MEL5. Furthermore, in G361 and SK-MEL5 xenograft model, intratumoral injection of AdSOCS1 vector significantly reduced tumor volumes compared to AdLacZ-injected mice. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that SOCS1 was overexpressed and induced apoptosis in the tissues from AdSOCS1-injected mice. The anti-proliferative effect of SOCS1 correlated with decreased levels of the activation of STAT3 and increased levels of p53. Furthermore the G0/G1 cell population was increased by overexpression of SOCS1 in G361. On the other hand, in SK-MEL28, SOCS1 delivery didn't reduce cell proliferation so markedly. CONCLUSIONS \", \" We showed that overexpression of SOCS-1 suppresses a proliferation of G361 and SK-MEL5 malignant melanoma cells via the suppression of JAK/STAT and the activation of p53 signaling pathways. Overexpression of SOCS-1 resulted in the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase. Furthermore, we firstly demonstrated that overexpression of SOCS-1 induced apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, low levels of phosphorylated STAT3 as well as a mutation of p53 in SK-MEL28 may be the reason why SOCS1 didn't reduce cell proliferation so markedly in SK-MEL28. We hope that these findings may lead to the successful clinical application of SOCS1 for melanoma treatment.\"]",

The current therapeutic options have shown little success in melanoma management. Therefore, novel mechanism and target-based strategies are needed for the management of this disease. The mammalian SIRT1 or sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) 1 is a NAD(+)-dependent class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) that has been shown to play important roles in a variety of biological processes and diseases including cancer. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that 1) SIRT1 is overexpressed in human melanoma cells and tissues; 2) SIRT1 inhibition by Tenovin-1 resulted in decreased growth, viability, and clonogenic survival of melanoma cells; 3) Tenovin-1 treatment resulted in decreased level of SIRT1 protein and increased level of the tumor suppressor p53 (In', ' AACR Annual Meeting', ' Proceedings; 2012 March 31-April 4, Chicago, IL; Abstract # 4722). In this study we employed a proteomics approach using gel free Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify the downstream molecular targets of SIRT1 in melanoma. The human melanoma G361 cells were treated with Tenovin-1 (25 M; 48 h) followed by protein extraction. Extracted proteins were precipitated (using 10% TCA and 0.05% DTT), pelleted and washed with acetone and air dried. Samples were re-suspended, labelled, trypsin digested and subjected to LC-MS/MS on a linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) Orbitrap XL. The resultant peptide sequence data were matched against the uniprot_human_FR_CP_090710 database using Mascot (Matrix Sciences, London, UK).

We found 14 proteins (from a total of 1092) which showed +2 fold differential expressions with statistical significance (T-test, p value <0.05). Among these proteins, three proteins were found to be newly expressed whereas one was found to completely disappear following SIRT1 inhibition, under the experimental conditions employed. The differentially expressed proteins identified in our study are associated with RNA processing-, mitochondrial checkpoint- and apoptosis- pathways.

Previously, we studied the chemopreventive effects of SD on non-melanoma tumor development using both animal and cellular models. In this current study, we used the mouse melanoma B16F10 cell line to investigate the possible effects of SD on melanoma cell development. We found that SD at a 250 M concentrations inhibits cell duplication. Melanoma cells treated with SD do not form the contractile ring, a multi-protein complex involved in cell division. As a result of cytoskeleton modification, cells treated with SD do not show the ability to carry out de novo synthesis of DNA, and their DNA show a high degree of fragmentation compared to untreated controls. To explore the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the disassembly of the contractile machinery, our studies show that SD treatment inhibits cell membrane permeability for small molecular mass compounds (e.g. ethidium bromide which is used as an indicator for cell permeability to Ca2+ ions). These findings are consistent with the observation that SD increases cleavage of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), resulting in low PLA2 enzymatic activity. These findings are also consistent with the observation that SD, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, inhibits the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). As a result of the decline in membrane permeability in SD treated cells and the negative effect of SD on the protein level of phospholipase C (PLC), which both affect the activity of contractile machinery, the non-dividing cells undergo apoptosis. The latter notion is supported by findings that SD inhibits the expression of STAT-3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription protein), and cyclin D1 (an activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 4, Cdk4). SD treatment also enhances the cellular level of the tumor suppressing protein 53 (p53) and stimulates cleavage of the nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cleaved-PARP). SD also enhances the cellular level of cleaved-Caspase-3, -8, -9 and stimulates enzymatic activities of Caspase-3, -8 and -9. All these findings, in addition to inhibition of cell viability, suggest that SD most likely inhibits melanoma cell growth by arresting the cell-division cycle in a Go quiescent phase and simultaneously activates apoptosis via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.']",

Honokiol treatment significantly reduced (p<0.05) tumor volumes in both xenograft experiments. No evident signs of toxicity were observed in the honokiol treated animals. In both cell lines, honokiol significantly decreased (p<0.05) cell viability and proliferation, honokiol caused cell cycle arrest in Go/G1 phase in UACC-62 cell line, while it caused accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase in SKMEL-2 cell line; honokiol significantly increased the DNA fragmentation in both cell lines. Honokiol strongly decreased the expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin D2 and cyclin B1 while increasing the cleavage of caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 and PARP in both cell lines. In UACC-62 honokiol decreased the expressions of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin E, cdc2p34 and p21. In SKMEL-2, honokiol decreased the expression of CDK4, PCNA and increased the expression of p21. These findings suggest that honokiol is a good candidate for further studies as a treatment for malignant melanoma.

        "Background":"['INTRODUCTION', ' BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations occur in over half of all human melanomas. BRAF-mutant tumors are highly sensitive to small molecule inhibitors directed against the oncogenic BRAF protein. However, in tumors that lack the specific mutation, patients have few effective therapeutic options. To address the need for new therapies for patients with BRAF-wild-type (wt) melanoma, we hypothesized that the inhibition of the major nuclear export receptor CRM1 would result in nuclear accumulation of nuclear proteins, increase apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest independent of BRAF mutational status. To test our hypothesis, we examined the effects of a novel CRM1 inhibitor on melanoma cell lines with various BRAF and NRAS mutational backgrounds. METHODS', ' We used human malignant melanoma cell lines with BRAF mutation (Sk-Mel-28, A375, Mel-624, UACC903, MalMe-3M), BRAF-wt (MeWo) and BRAF-wt and NRAS mutation (Hs940T) to assess the effects of CRM1 inhibition, BRAF inhibition (PLX4032) or MEK inhibition (U0126) using both mono- or combination therapy. MTT assays were used to evaluate the effects of treatment on cell proliferation. FACS analysis with annexin/PI staining was performed to assess effects on cell cycle and cell death. The Chou-Talalay method was used to assess synergistic drug combination effects. Treatment effects on cleaved caspase-3, PARP cleavage, P53, and FOXO3 were analyzed by western blot analysis. RESULTS', ' As mono therapy, CRM1 inhibition led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and an increase in apoptosis in both BRAF wt and mutant cell lines. The degree of inhibition and cell death achieved by CRM1 inhibition across all melanoma cell lines is comparable to the results achieved by BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 in BRAF mutant cell lines. Furthermore, the combination of CRM1 inhibition and BRAF inhibition results in a strongly synergistic combination against BRAF mutant cell lines with a statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSION', ' We found that relative to other cancer cell types, both BRAF-mutant and BRAF-wt melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to CRM1 inhibition. In addition, CRM1 inhibition significantly enhanced the effect of PLX4032 in BRAF-mutant cell lines, suggesting that the combination of these two drugs may address the emergence of acquired resistance to BRAF monotherapy. Based on these results, CRM1 inhibition warrants further investigation to determine its potential benefit in treating melanoma patients independent of BRAF mutation status.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma remains a leading cause of death from skin diseases due to its propensity to metastasis, and is increasing rapidly in children. Although, melanoma is less common than other types of skin cancers, however, it causes the majority (75%) of skin cancer-related deaths. The average survival of patients with advanced stage of melanoma is less than a year because no effective strategies are available for metastatic melanoma. Since melanoma is a highly malignant cancer, an approach that can inhibit its growth and progression may facilitate the development of an effective strategy for its treatment or prevention. As green tea polyphenols (GTPs) have been shown to have anti-skin carcinogenic effects, we have examined the chemotherapeutic effect of GTPs on the growth of different melanoma cell lines and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects using an in vitro model. Treatment of melanoma cells (A375 and Hs294t) with GTPs (0, 20, 40 and 60 g/ml) for 24 and 48 h significantly inhibited histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, reduced the levels of class 1 HDAC proteins (HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 8) and enhanced histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity in a dose-dependent manner. These effects of GTPs on melanoma cells were associated with DNA damage, which was evident by Comet assay, and significant reduction in the viability of melanoma cells and induction of cell death. Concomitant treatment of melanoma cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, prevented GTPs-induced degradation of class I HDACs, suggesting that GTPs reduced the levels of HDAC proteins in melanoma cells through proteasomal degradation. Valproic acid, an inhibitor of HDACs, exhibited a similar pattern of reduced viability and induction of death of melanoma cells (A375 and Hs294t). Treatment of A375 and Hs294t cells with GTPs resulted in an alteration of cell cycle regulatory proteins of G0/G1 phase, and that is a decrease in the levels of cyclin D1, D2 and E, and cyclin dependent kinases, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, it was also observed that the levels of p21 and p53 proteins were also increased in the cells after the treatment with GTPs, which may have a role in G0/G1 phase arrest and DNA damage. Together, our study provides new insights into the role of class I HDACs in the chemotherapeutic effects of green tea polyphenols on melanoma cells.']",

Results', ' Responsive tumor sites revealed complete pathologic response at time of surgery. Progressive tumor demonstrated viable ULMS. IHC showed tumor cells negative for PD-L1 and positive for PD-L2 both preRx and postRx. Degree of PD-1+ lymphocyte infiltration decreased significantly postRx compared to preRx. PreRx harbored exomic focal MYC amplification, TP53 nonsense mutation, and heterozygous PTEN deletion. PostRx maintained these genomic alterations and acquired a loss-of-function mutation in PTEN that resulted in biallelic PTEN inactivation. PreRx tumor expressed tumor-specific neoantigens (TSNs) that were immunogenic to patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells; expression of TSNs decreased postRx.

        "Background":"[\"Gene expression data can be used to identify the activation status of genes and pathways in tumor samples and to infer the structure of regulatory networks. Most tumor datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas focus on unperturbed samples, and subsequently, the statistical frameworks that analyze them.We hypothesized that perturbation of cells can uncover network structures that are undetectable in basal state, and reveal the complexity of cancer cells. To demonstrate this, we generated gene expression data from a panel of melanoma cell lines before and after inhibition of MEK or AKT.Here we present a new computational framework to analyze gene expression data before and after perturbations. The algorithm aims to define differential networks1 - rewiring of network components in different tumors. The algorithm sheds light on the complex and context-specific nature of network structure, including pathways that are activated, or under the control of MAPK or AKT, only in a subset of samples.The perturbation data allowed us to assess pathway activation levels that are undetectable in unperturbed state. For example, AKT is activated in melanoma by PTEN loss, but the effect of NRAS mutation on AKT is unknown, and AKT activation is undetectable in unperturbed cells. Our algorithm identified an AKT activation signature in perturbed state, and helped define the effects of PTEN and NRAS mutations on the pathway. Additionally, the algorithm inferred the genetic status of p53 in each cell line by identifying pathway activation, changes that are, once again, detectable only after perturbations.By linking protein data with the algorithm's results, we identified cell lines with constitutive activation of the STAT3 pathway, and demonstrated the crosstalk between MAPK and STAT3 pathways.Moreover, combining the results from the algorithm with known signatures of drug-sensitivity accurately predicted which drug combinations provided a synergistic effect in each cell line. Associations between pathway activity level and drug sensitivity are known for some drugs. By using our algorithm's ability to infer pathway status in different tumors and to detect changes in those pathways after drug treatment, it correctly predicted when drug treatment sensitized cells to the effects of chemotherapy and other drugs.To conclude, we show that gene expression of perturbed cells greatly enhances the power of network structure analysis. Our results reveal context-specific changes in network structure, and predict which cell lines are sensitized to specific drugs by pathway perturbations. These results have direct applicability to the development of drug combinations in melanoma.1 Pe'er and Hacohen, Cell 2011Citation Format\", \" Oren Litvin, Sarit Schwartz, Mark Rocco, Tanya Schild, Neal Rosen, Dana Pe'er.

        "Background":"['The contribution ultraviolet radiation (UVR) makes to genetically distinct melanoma subtypes is unclear. Melanoma driven by oncogenic BRAF or oncogenic NRAS differ in their epidemiological, clinicopathological and genetic features. NRAS melanoma in humans occurs in older individuals and presents at sites most exposed to UVR damage such as the head and neck.In this study we show excessive sun exposure and NRAS-driven melanoma can co-occur by juxtaposing the epidemiological, clinical and genetic characteristics of a G12DNRAS-driven human melanoma case subject to extreme UVR exposure. To model the interaction of UVR with specific oncogenes and mimic human disease, we used mouse melanoma models driven by V600EBRAF or G12DNRAS. We previously reported that UVR cooperates with V600EBRAF by targeting the tumour suppressor TP53. In this study we confirm that UVR cooperates with G12DNRAS to drive melanoma and, as observed in humans, murine UVR-G12DNRAS melanoma occurs in older animals that accumulate higher lifetime exposure to UVR. Furthermore, we find murine UVR-G12DNRAS melanomas are histologically and genetically heterogeneous, and distinct to UVR-V600EBRAF murine and human melanomas. UVR-G12DNRAS melanomas present more UVR-induced mutations, a longer latency to tumour development and secondary driver mutations distinct from UVR-V600EBRAF melanoma. We investigated whether UVR cooperates equally with other RAS isoforms, and exposed G12DKRAS animals to UVR. These animals presented a different latency to melanoma development and specific cooperating secondary targets distinct from UVR-V600EBRAF and UVR- G12DNRAS. This implies that different RAS isoforms activate oncogenic pathways differently. Critically, UVR-V600EBRAF, UVR-G12DNRAS, UVR-G12DKRAS tumors present similar mutation rates when UVR exposure is held constant, which suggests that the differences in tumour latency might be explained if melanomas driven by different oncogenes require varying numbers of subsequent co-operators.Finally, we present preclinical evidence showing how targeting the UVR-induced mutations found in the long tail of UVR-related mutations in NRAS melanoma can provide therapeutic options for NRAS mutant melanoma patients.The insight gained begins to provide a molecular explanation for distinct associations between UVR and individual oncogenes in melanomagenesis, and we show how UVR-induced damage can be exploited to stratify patients for personalised therapy approaches.']",

        "Background":"['Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is often a rate-limiting event in the treatment of metastatic cancers. Mutations of TP53 or dysfunctions in the p53 pathway are known to play primary roles in the resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents. A stapled alpha-helical p53 peptide (SAH-p53) capable of disrupting the p53-HDM2 and p53-HDMX complexes and restoring p53 function has been found to induce a death response in breast, melanoma and choriocarcinoma cancer cells independent of p53 mutational status. We have recently discovered that the mechanism of death induced by SAH-p53 does not exhibit all of the characteristics of classical apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy independently. The binding of SAH-p53 to HDM2, HDMX, or a yet unidentified target results in a mechanism that leads to the intracellular aggregation of proteins and lipids that are extruded from the cell, resulting in catastrophic damage to the integrity of the cell membrane and culminating in cell death. This type of cell death involves the loss of cytoplasm, generation of phase-clear vacuole-like structures, apparent degradation of cellular membrane components, and the significant release of uniform non-vesicular cellular components. The cellular debris, while yet undefined, displays orange staining with acridine orange as well as accumulation of MitoTracker, suggesting that the debris contains hydrophobic regions. Thus far it has been established that there is a lack of any membrane blebbing, no chromatin condensation, no apoptosis signaling events or typical necrotic bubble formation after treatment with SAH-p53 in cells harboring wild-type p53, mutant p53, or null p53, suggesting an alternative mechanism of cell death. Data suggest the manifestation of early autophagy within 6 hours of SAH-p53 treatment as evidenced by LC3 accumulation, yet this phenotype is lost within 24 hours post-treatment. In addition, the pretreatment of the cells with chloroquine does not inhibit the release of debris and changes in morphology characteristic of SAH-p53 treatment, suggesting that the mechanism of death is independent of classical autophagy. We have begun to uncover the precise mechanism of cell death through the identification and validation of the transcriptional program regulated by SAH-p53 in both wild-type and mutant p53-containing cells via microarray analysis. The complete understanding and characterization of this novel mechanism may be exploited to overcome resistance to apoptosis and thus lead to a more effective way of treating chemotherapy-resistant metastatic cancers.']",

Mature miRNA is created from long primary genomic transcripts (pri-miRNA), which are processed in the nucleus. The resulting 60-80-nucleotide precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are transferred to the cytoplasm and are treated to produce a short RNA duplex. One strand of the duplex is degraded, the remaining single-stranded miRNA molecule associates with members of the Argonaute protein family, to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC plus the guide miRNA bind to the 3untranslated region (3-UTR) of the targeted mRNA and induce gene down-regulation by mRNA cleavage or translational repression. Serum stimulation of cancer cells has been shown to prompt positive regulatory transcription factors, such as c-Jun, c-Fos and Egr-1, as well as increasing transcriptional repressors such as YY1, NAB2 and GCF2. These transcription factors play critical parts in the early stimulation of cancer disease phenotypes and are prime targets for clarifying disease pathways and as therapeutic candidates. The identification of microRNAs regulating the mRNAs of transcription factors will improve our understanding of the mechanism of disease gene stimulation and subsequent pathway initiation leading to cancer disease phenotypes. MicroRNAs that ablate disease phenotypes are possible pharmaceutical therapies. Our aim was to identify and profile microRNAs that interact with the mRNA of transcription factors such as c-Jun and c-Fos.Results', 'We measured the expresion of c-Jun and c-Fos at the mRNA and protein levels (time course 0 to 6 hrs) in MM200 (human melanoma). We measured the expression of two microRNAs, miR155 and miR125b, which have been reported as playing a role in regulating c-Jun and c-Fos in Dermal Fibroblasts and melanoma cells (Song, Liu et al. Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry 2012 and Kappelmann, Kuphal et al. Oncogene 2013). We show that miR-155 and miR-125b expression is repressed following serum activation in these two cell lines (HEK293 and MM200). Loss of function and gain-of-function studies in these cancer cell lines, by supressing and overexpressing miR155/125b were performed. Subsquently, a target 3UTR vs microRNA study was conducted that demonstrated that the miR-155 and miR-125b have the ability to recognize and repress c-Jun and c-Fos. Moreover, phenotypic studies such as migration, proliferation, cell cycle were performed.Conclusions', 'miR-155 and miR-125b are able to regulate c-Jun and c-Fos mRNAs and to inhibit their expression at the protein level.']",

        "Background":"['IGF-1R is frequently up-regulated in cancers including melanoma, and is implicated in mediating resistance to chemotherapy and targeted agents via regulation of apoptosis. Here, we investigated responses to temozolomide (TMZ), a methylating agent that generates toxic O6-methylguanine (O6meG) adducts, which are removed by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Persistent O6meG adducts trigger futile cycles of mismatch repair, ultimately leading to formation of replication-associated DSBs. In a first approach to test links between IGF-1R and response to TMZ, we used a panel of 10 human melanoma cell lines in which we characterized MGMT expression, activation and expression of IGF axis components, and growth inhibitory effects of TMZ. We found that TMZ GI50 values correlated with MGMT levels (r=0.79, p=0.009), and in 7 MGMT-proficient cell lines, with phospho-IGF-1R (r=0.81, p=0.038) suggesting a link between TMZ resistance and IGF-1R activation. In a second approach we used IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) AZ12253801 and linsitinib (OSI-906), which is currently undergoing clinical evaluation, to assess effects of blocking IGF signaling. These IGF-1R TKIs were capable of sensitizing wild-type and mutant BRAF melanoma cells to TMZ; lack of correlation with apoptosis induction suggested that other factors contributed to this effect. IGF-1R inhibition did not influence MGMT expression or activity, was not epistatic with MGMT inhibition, and TMZ-sensitized MGMT-null cells, suggesting that chemo-sensitization was MGMT-independent. We found that IGF-1R TKI sensitized melanoma cells to inhibition of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), and influenced processing of TMZ-induced DSBs, with increased RPA focus formation within 24hr of TMZ application, and persistence of RAD51 foci at 72hr. These data suggest functional impairment of homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSB repair. Compared with simultaneous or prior IGF-1R TKI, TMZ sensitization was greater when IGF-1R TKI followed TMZ, consistent with a model in which IGF-1R inhibitor pre-treatment reduces DSB yield. In mice bearing melanoma xenografts with a clinically relevant (V600E BRAF, wild-type p53) genotype, this sequential (TMZlinsitinib) combination treatment was tolerable, and linsitinib achieved peak plasma levels comparable to clinical Cmax values. TMZ and linsitinib caused minor inhibition of tumor growth (gradient reduction of 13% and 25% respectively), while the combination caused supra-additive growth delay (72%) that was significantly different from control (p<0.01), TMZ (p<0.01) and linsitinib (p<0.05) groups. In summary, IGF-1R inhibition influences HR repair of TMZ-induced DSBs and sensitizes melanomas to TMZ using treatment schedules relevant to clinical practice.']",

Methods', ' Antiproliferative effect of YM155 was evaluated by sulforhodamine B assay. Intracellular mRNA and protein levels of apoptosis related biomarkers, cell viability and caspase 3/7 activity were evaluated after the treatment with survivin siRNA or YM155TXT.

        "Background":"['Melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, whose rates of morbidity and mortality are increasing. The development of immunotherapies like anti-PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies has resulted in fundamental advances in the treatment of some cancers. However, long lasting responses are only observed in a subset of immunotherapy-treated patients. This shortfall highlights the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern tumor response to immunotherapy.To address this need, autologous patient-derived tumor cell lines and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were utilized in an in vitro high throughput screen, to identify compounds that increase the sensitivity of melanoma cells to T cell mediated cytotoxicity. The screen consisted of an 850 compound library. One group of compounds that was most able to enhance T cell killing of melanoma cells was topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors such as topotecan and irinotecan.Our results indicate that treatment of melanoma cells with a Top1 inhibitor prior to exposure to autologous T cells produced a synergistic increase in tumor cell death, as measured by intracellular staining of activated caspase 3. We have also recapitulated this finding in an in vivo model, where a better anti-tumor effect was observed in tumor bearing mice treated with an antibody against the co-inhibitory molecule PDL1 in combination with MM398 (nanoliposomal irinotecan), than in cohorts treated with either -PDL1 or Top1 inhibitor alone. These findings suggest synergism between Top1 inhibitors and immune-based therapies in the treatment of melanoma.Molecular changes elicited by inhibition of Top1 are now being investigated to identify the factors that mediate the effect of Top1 inhibitors on T cell-mediated killing of melanoma. We have identified a p53-driven gene signature in Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cell lines and are investigating the functional relevance of Tumor Protein p53 Inducible Nuclear Protein 1 (TP53INP1) in mediating increased T cell killing of Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cells. Our results indicate that TP53INP1 is a critical component of this apoptotic response, as overexpression of TP53INP1 in melanoma cells increased their susceptibility to T cell mediated cytotoxicity. Complementary to this observation, we have also found that knockdown of TP53INP1 by shRNA, impedes the sensitivity of Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cells to T cell mediated killing.Understanding how Top1 inhibitors enhance melanoma killing by immunotherapy will allow for the development of predictive biomarkers, and also augment immune-based therapeutic strategies to ensure durable responses in a larger population of melanoma patients. By using melanoma as a model disease system, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics of cancer immune response that may be applied to other cancers where effective treatment strategies are also lacking.']",

Multiplex panel testing may be an efficient way of evaluating MP patients for the presence of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes. However the spectrum of mutations in many cancer susceptibility genes in the MP patient population is largely unknown. We performed massively parallel sequencing using targeted capture of 15 genes with well-established risks of breast and/or other cancers, specifically TP53, CDH1, PTEN, STK11, ATM, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, RAD50, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MUTYH. Our patient cohort consisted of 221 BRCA1/2 negative patients diagnosed with breast cancer and at least one other primary cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients diagnosed with contralateral breast cancer were included. Thirty patients (14%) were found to have at least one deleterious variant in these 15 genes. Deleterious variants were found in CHEK2 (16 patients, 7.2%), TP53 (4, 1.8%), MSH6 (3, 1.4%), ATM (2, 0.9%) and one patient each had deleterious variants in CDKN2A, PTEN, PMS2, PALB2, BRIP1 and NBN. In addition, six patients (2.7%) were found to be heterozygous carriers of a MUTYH mutation. In comparison, deleterious variants were identified in 9% of 341 patients with breast cancer only, indicating a small but nonsignificant increase in the rate of deleterious variants in MP patients. The rate of MUTYH heterozygous mutations was also non-significantly different in patients with breast cancer only (1.2%). There was a significant increase in the rate of CHEK2 and MSH6 mutations in the MP versus breast-only patients (7.2% vs 3.5%, p = 0.04 for CHEK2 and 1.4% vs 0%, p = 0.05 for MSH6). As a corollary study, a subset of MP patients (n = 165) were assayed on a panel including TET2. Deleterious TET2 mutations were identified in 2 of 165 patients (1.2%) at allele frequencies of 0.17 and 0.36. These patients blood samples were ascertained at ages 77 and 72, respectively. These preliminary data show that in our cohort of patients with multiple primary cancers, over 16% of patients were found to have deleterious variants in 15 cancer susceptibility genes. In addition, approximately 1% of MP patients have deleterious variants in TET2 that may be due to age-related clonal hematopoiesis, although it is unknown if these mutations are related to the development of the tumors in these individuals.

        "Background":"['The tumor suppressor protein p53 functions at the center of a complex biological network that translates diverse stress signals into cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. MDM2 inhibits p53 activity by binding to the transactivation domain of p53 and by acting as a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. The disruption of the interaction between p53 and MDM2 with small molecular mass molecules has demonstrated encouraging single agent anti-tumor activity in preclinical in vitro and in vivo settings. While p53 wild-type status is necessary for response to antagonists of the p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction (PPI), there is diversity in response to such therapeutic agents across p53 wild-type tumor models. As such, the ability to predict p53 wild-type tumor responsiveness to antagonists of the p53-MDM2 PPI is an unmet need that could significantly impact clinical development of modulators of the p53-MDM2 PPI. Here, we explored the effect of SAR405838, a selective p53-MDM2 antagonist, on a panel of 65 p53 wild-type cell lines derived from different tumors of origin. Over 80% of these cell lines showed some degree of sensitivity to SAR405838 when used as a single agent. Three broad response classes were observed', ' non-responders, responders involving apoptosis, and responders not involving apoptosis. A small number of tissue types were consistently enriched among responders (melanoma and leukemia) and non-responders (cervical and uterine tumors). By comparing pre-treatment gene expression profiling data with the single agent sensitivity to SAR405838, we identified a signature of 39 genes that clearly predicts non-response vs response. Within these 39 genes, CDKN2A was upregulated in non-responders, and MDM2 was upregulated in responders. Gene set enrichment analysis and GO category enrichments were consistent with predicted sensitivity in melanoma and leukemia, and indicate that a gene expression signature of loss of p53 pathway function predicts lack of single agent activity of SAR405838. 3-fold cross-validation of this classifier showed an accuracy of 94%, and principle component analyses was used to down-select the signature to the smallest number of genes carrying the maximum information and derive the optimal cut-off for making prospective response predictions.

Methods', ' We tested the effects on cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA damage of the pan-HDACi LBH589 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a healthy donor (HD), four patients with metastatic melanoma (MM), two previously established human melanoma cell lines (M229 and M370), and two bone marrow samples of patients with multiple myeloma previously treated with GM-CSF. In addition, phospho-flow cytometry was used to study the effects of the HDACi on intracellular signalling in lymphocytes with or without pulsing with IL2 (400IU) or IFN (10,000). For some experiments, HD PBMC were genetically modified to express the T cell receptor (TCR) for the melanoma antigen MART-1 using retroviral transduction for testing in in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Results. In replicate experiments the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of LBH589 for PBMC was low (< 20 nM) in comparison to the melanoma cells (> 600 nM). LBH589 induced > 20% (10 nM) and > 40% (1-10 mM) apoptotic cell death demonstrated by double presence of a sub-G0/G1 peak and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in PBMC samples, while it was < 10% in melanoma cell lines at these same concentrations. In a DNA damage assay, there was around 2-fold increase in the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2A.X in HD PBMC at 1 nM, while it required 10 nM for the similar effect in the melanoma cell line M229. However, the phosphorylation of H2A.X in PBMCs of three patients with MM (1 nM LBH589) was slightly inhibited. The pH2A.X of the other cell line and one of the MM patients was a 1.5- fold increase. The maximal effects on signaling pathways were seen after 30 minutes of treatment. LBH589 slightly inhibited phosphorylation of STATs 1, 3, 5 and 6 and MAPK proteins (p38, ERK), p53, cyclin D3 and histone H3 in flow gated B and T cells from the HD. On the contrary, the same phosphoproteins were activated up to six times higher in the MM patient samples and in a bone marrow sample. Conclusions. The HDACi LBH589 induced cytotoxic effects at nanomolar concentrations on human lymphocytes and altered key signaling pathways involved in lymphocyte activation. These effects are at lower concentrations than the antitumor activity in melanoma in vitro, resulting in an adverse therapeutic window.

        "Meeting_name":" T-oligo mechanism of action and delivery with an alpha-helical peptide",
        "Background":"[\"When telomeres are critically short, the telomere overhang is exposed which induces cell senescence or apoptosis. T-oligo, an oligonucleotide homologous to the telomere overhang, induces DNA damage responses similar to those induced after exposure of the telomere overhang, and is an effective, cancer-specific therapy both in vitro and in vivo. However, T-oligo's mechanism of action is unclear, and as an oligonucleotide, its inherent instability severely limits its clinical use. Hence, our studies focus on its mechanism of action, stabilization and improved delivery. To understand T-oligo's mechanism of action, we studied the role of the telomere specific poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, tankyrase-1, in T-oligo induced DNA damage responses. In normal cells, tankyrase-1 PARsylates TRF1 which causes disruption of the shelterin complex and exposure of the T-loop. This exposure activates telomerase resulting in elongation of telomeres leading to possible cell immortality. This mechanism has made tankyrase-1 inhibition a potential therapy for telomerase inhibitor resistant cancers where tankyrase-1 is found to be upregulated. Since several studies suggest that tankyrase-1 and T-oligo may have important roles in p53 mediated DNA damage responses to critically shortened telomeres, we measured total and phospho-p53 in MU melanoma cells after treatment with tankyrase-1 inhibitors by immunoblot analysis. We found that cells treated with T-oligo and tankyrase-1 inhibitors, 3AB and XAV939, exhibited a 4 and 2 fold down regulation of phospho-p53, and 2.5 and 2 fold down regulation of total p53, respectively, compared to T-oligo alone which increased phospho-p53 and total p53 by 4 and 2 fold, respectively. Furthermore, XAV939, when given with T-oligo, completely abrogated T-oligo induced inhibition of cell proliferation, indicating that tankyrase-1 may play a role in T-oligo induced DNA damage responses. To improve T-oligo's delivery, we combined T-oligo with a nano-sized cationic -helical polypeptide (PVBLG150-8) which stabilizes the negatively charged T-oligo. We complexed and delivered T-oligo with PVBLG150-8 into H358 lung cancer and AN melanoma cells. We found that in vitro delivery of the T-oligo and peptide (0.025-.25 mg/ml) complex inhibited AN melanoma cell growth in a dose responsive manner from 4.5-8.3 fold compared to untreated controls, while T-oligo alone inhibited growth by only 3 fold. Similarly, when H358 cells were given T-oligo complexed with PVBLG150-8 (0.0125-.25 mg/ml), their growth was inhibited in a dose dependent manner from 3.3-6.6 fold, compared to T-oligo alone (2 fold). Our studies indicate that T-oligo has great potential as an anti-cancer therapy, and due to its unique mechanism of action, it could be used in patients with upregulated tankyrase-1 activity. Additionally, T-oligo delivery and efficacy can be greatly improved when complexed with a cationic -helical polypeptide.\"]",

Methods', '  The Stratified Medicine Programme (SMP) aims to develop a model for high quality, large-scale molecular characterization of cancer specimens through an initiative developed in partnership with AstraZeneca, Pfizer, the UK Department of Health and academic researchers. Phase One of the SMP is a two year feasibility study. It aims to demonstrate the submission of consented blood samples and sections of surplus diagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue from 9,000 patients at centres across the UK to one of three technology hubs for mutation testing of genes of potential clinical interest (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, TMPRSS2-ERG, EGFR, EML4-ALK and KIT) in six selected tumour types. The tests are technically validated and will be completed in clinically relevant timescales.  Data including pathological and treatment information and clinical outcome is also collected for the recruited patients, linked to the genetic data and stored in a central data repository hosted within the National Cancer Registration Service.  The study opened in September 2011 at 7 sites across the UK and by the end of 2011, 760 patientswith breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, ovarian cancer or metastatic malignant melanoma had consented to participate.  142 sets of molecular results had been returned to clinical teams. Updated figures will be presented at the meeting, by which time the programme is projected to have accrued 4000 subjects.  By 2013, we hope to have developed a scalable model for routine, high quality, prospective molecular characterisation of tumours for NHS cancer patients, with consent for the collection, storage and research use of population-scale genetic and clinical outcome data.

Functional genomic screens in cancer cells to discover new therapeutic targets are usually carried out in vitro where interaction with the immune system is absent. Here we report a pooled, loss-of-function genetic screening approach using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing that is conducted in vivo in mouse transplantable tumors treated with vaccination and PD-1 checkpoint blockade. We tested 2,400 genes expressed by melanoma cells for those that synergize with or cause resistance to checkpoint blockade, and recovered the known immune evasion molecules, PD-L1 and CD47. Loss of function of multiple genes required to sense interferon-y caused resistance to immunotherapy. Deletion of Ptpn2, a pleotropic protein tyrosine phosphatase improved response to immunotherapy. In vivo, Ptpn2 deficient tumors showed increased infiltration of activated CD8+T cells. In vitro, Ptpn2 loss by tumor cells increased antigen presentation to T cells. Biochemical, transcriptional and genetic epistasis experiments demonstrated that loss of function of Ptpn2 sensitizes tumors to immunotherapy by enhancing interferon-y-mediated effects on the tumor cell. Thus, augmenting interferon-y signaling in tumor cells could increase the efficacy of immunotherapy. More generally, in vivo genetic screens in tumor models can identify new immunotherapy targets and rationally prioritize combination therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Detection of low abundant alterations in oncogenes from circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) samples or formaldehyde fixed-paraffin embedded samples (FFPE) has been a challenge for the community. Additionally, cfDNA and FFPE samples are typically limited in the amount of material that can be obtained, and often the FFPE samples are highly degraded, compounding the ability to sequence them and to perform accurate variant calling. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a single tube, multiplexed amplicon sequencing technology that employ hundreds of primer pairs for amplification of targeted loci, producing ready-to-run libraries for Illumina sequencing platforms. The resulting amplicons are less than 150 bp in length, enabling amplification and sensitive detection of mutations from cfDNA-sized DNA fragments or highly damaged DNA. A 200+ amplicon panel across 55 genes was developed to target known clinically relevant oncological mutations. The panel design encompasses single exons (e.g. BRAF) as well as comprehensive exon coverage of entire genes (e.g. TP53).DNA was extracted from FFPE, and cfDNA was extracted from fresh plasma. DNA was quantified by qPCR using 2 primer pairs targeting ALU repeat regions. 10ng of DNA input was used to perform the multiplexed PCR. Libraries were quantified by qPCR and sequenced with MiSEQ V2 reagents, paired end reads. Alignment was performed using Burrows-wheeler Aligner (BWA) and variant calling was performed with at least two validated publicly available tools and confirmed manually by IGV. A variety of tools were used to validate allele technology was used to validate the sequencing data.We interrogated 80 FFPE samples using our amplicon technology.The percent of on-target bases was over 95% and the coverage uniformity was over 98%, where uniformity is the percent based covered over 20% of the mean coverage. Out of the 40 colorectal cancer samples tested, 17 showed mutations in KRAS. Out of the 20 melanoma samples (Cure line) also analyzed, 9 were positive for BRAF V600E. The presence of those mutations was confirmed using myTprimerTM KRAS and BRAF qPCR assay. The limit of detection of the assay was set at 3% due to the inherent noise caused by the damage from the FFPE samples. For cell lines with known mutations, the sensitivity was 0.5%. No false positive or false negative were reported. 20 FFPE samples from different cancer types were also assessed. Mutations were identified in ERBB2 (cervical cancer), ALK (lung cancer) and TP53 (colon cancer) genes, as well as MET amplification (lung cancer).Cell free DNA provides a non-invasive tool to monitor cancer progression and treatment efficacy. Tumor DNA, matching blood DNA and cfDNA from 10 cancer patients will be subjected to our multiplex PCR oncology panel. Data of this study will be presented.Our results show that this unique multiplex PCR panel is an excellent tool to assess multiple oncogenes in limiting clinical samples, enabling high throughput, cost effective NGS analysis.']",

        "Background":"['The S100 family of proteins displays no enzymatic activity but has been shown to play roles in an array of biological functions such as calcium homeostasis, cellular growth, inflammation, and metabolism. The influence of these homodimeric proteins is mediated through protein-protein interactions in a typically calcium dependent manner and aberrant expression of S100 proteins has been linked to a variety of cancers, cardiomyopathies, and neurological disorders. Of particular interest, S100B is highly over-expressed in many cancers, including malignant melanoma (MM). In MM, S100B is used as prognostic indicator in evaluating treatment success and in predicting relapse. Studies now show that S100B is more than a clinical marker, and that it binds wild-type p53 in a calcium-dependent manner, sequestering it, and promoting its degradation. This results in the loss of p53-dependent tumor suppression activities. As inhibition of S100B expression by RNA interference restores both wild-type p53 protein levels and normal transcriptional activation/apoptosis activities, we have made it our long-term goal is to specifically inhibit the S100B-p53 interaction in order to restore the p53 tumor suppression function as a potential therapy for malignant melanoma. Although we have succeeded in identifying many S100B inhibitors (also known as SBiXs), optimization studies are a necessary part of the development of drugs with useful therapeutic activities. Included amongst these optimization studies are characterizations of structure-activity relationships (SAR). Our initial SAR studies have resulted in the development of a second series of SBiXs. Amongst this series is the novel S100B inhibitor, SBi4225. As part of the cyclical process of SAR studies, the binding of SBi4225 to S100B has been investigated using X-ray crystallography. As described within, SBi4225 binds to S100B in a position and orientation analogous to its predecessors, SBi4211 and SBi1. NMR data including chemical shift perturbations of 15N isotopically labeled protein backbone were consistent with the X-ray crystal structures and demonstrated the relevance of the SBi4225-S100B complex in solution. This new understanding of the SBi4225 structure/function relationship will undoubtedly impact the development and optimization of future SBiXs.']",

        "Meeting_name":" The role of human endogenous retroviral proteins in the development of Merlin-deficient tumors and as potential drug targets",
        "Background":"[\"Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder caused by loss of the tumour suppressor Merlin leading to the development of multiple tumours of the nervous system such as schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Merlin-deficient tumours may also occur sporadically including all schwannomas, 50-60% meningiomas and 29-38% ependymomas. Loss of functional Merlin have been also observed in other tumours e.g. mesothelioma, melanoma, and a portion of glioma, prostate and breast cancers. Current therapies for Merlin-deficient tumours, comprising surgery and radiosurgery are invasive and not fully effective therefore the emphasis has to be made on the development of new effective drug-based treatments.Schwannoma is the most common Merlin-deficient tumour, a hallmark for NF2 and a model for all other Merlin-deficient tumours. We have developed the human in vitro model for schwannoma to study tumour pathobiology and for drug testing. Using this model we have shown strong overexpression and activation of ErbB2/ErbB32, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), Insulin like growth factor receptor-I (IGF-IR) and activation of Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and Wnt/-catenin signalling pathways. Following, we have successfully tested new drugs such as AZD6244, Sorafenib, BEZ235, Lapatinib, Imatinib and Nilotinib. These studies revealed that schwannomas pathological proliferation, survival and adhesion is regulated by highly complex networks interacting and compensating each other resulting in increased tumour pathology. We suggest that the inhibition of a single target will not be sufficient to stop tumour growth and that multi-targeted therapy would be needed.Endogenous retroviruses are viruses that have integrated themselves into germ-line chromosomes and thereby become part of the human genome sequence (8%). One group, HERVK, has been found to be overexpressed in several cancers and is currently being investigated as potential immunotherapy targets. Our preliminary data demonstrate that HERVK envelope, capsid, Rec and Np9 proteins are overexpressed in human primary schwannoma cells and tissues. Additionally, HERVK envelope and capsid proteins are released from schwannoma cells. HERVK overexpression is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational level and is partially Merlin dependent. Anti-HERVK antibodies reduced schwannoma proliferation, pERK/pAKT/ pFAK and cyclin D1 levels and increased expression of p53. Also, pre-incubation of schwannoma cells with anti-HERVK antibodies prior to treatment with AZD6244 potentiated drug's efficiency. An HIV/HERVK protease inhibitor, Ritonavir, also decreased proliferation of schwannoma cells and increased the efficiency of AZD6244, Sorafenib and BEZ235 when combined. We suggest that HERVK plays a relevant role in schwannoma and possibly other Merlin-deficient tumours development and is a promising therapeutic target.\"]",

The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibody drugs are effective in a subset of colorectal cancers, but the molecular mechanisms of resistance are understood poorly. Genes involved in epigenetic regulation are frequently deregulated in cancer, raising the possibility that such genes also contribute to drug resistance. To address this question, we compiled an shRNA library for chromatin modifying enzymes, chromatin remodelers, and many other factors associated with chromatin regulation. Using this library, we performed a loss of function genetic screen in colon cancer cell lines sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. We identified SIRT2, a NAD+ dependent deacetylase, as a modulator of the response to EGFR inhibitors in colon and lung cancer. Mechanistically, loss of SIRT2 expression enhanced MEK acetylation, resulting in increased ERK activity. Conversely, overexpression of SIRT2 led to reduced phospho ERK and inhibition of growth. SIRT2 loss also conferred resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma and KRAS mutant colon cancers, respectively.

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND. Poorly vascularized solid tumors are exposed to regions of low oxygen and glucose deprivation. These restrictions may promote either defensive autophagy or cell death through excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), mediated by activated NADPH oxidases (NOX) which transport electrons from NADPH on the cytoplasmic side of plasma membranes to reduce molecular oxygen at the extracellular space, increasing superoxide anion radical (O2-). .OBJECTIVES. To investigate in genetically-matched human melanoma cells with wt or mutant p53, responses to', ' a) autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and to glucose-lowering metformin or to hypoxia in glucose-supplemented medium; b) pyruvate in glucose-free medium under normoxia or hypoxia; c) sub-physiological glucose. EXPERIMENTAL. Responses to normoxia or hypoxia were assesed by live-dead fluorometric assays, or by crystal violet staining of surviving cells. Mechanisms influencing response to glucose limitation were studied by specific immune blotting. RESULTS. Lower susceptibility to chloroquine  metformin involving greater basal AMPK activation was seen in physiological 5 mM glucose in mutant p53 cells. These cells were also preferentially protected from prolonged hypoxia by glucose supplementation or by pyruvate supplementation of glucose-free medium under normoxia, but not under hypoxia. Sub-physiological glucose without pyruvate induced apoptosis-associated PARP cleavage irrespective of p53 status. However, treatment with impermeable exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) to remove extracellular superoxide signalling across cell membranes, preferentially counteracted PARP cleavage only in wt p53 cells with lower LDHA expression after 48 hr in 2.5 mM glucose. CONCLUSIONS. Glucose availability increases resistance to hypoxia or to chloroquine  metformin in mutant p53 cells.

Our models consisted of', ' 39 colorectal cancer samples, 30 pancreatic cancers, 25 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 11 melanomas, 7 ovarian cancers, 4 breast cancers, and 4 small cell lung cancers. Among our 120 samples, 22% (26) did not show any of the analyzed mutations or deletions, 78% (94) showed at least one mutation, and of those', ' 56 had 2 or more mutations (44%). In colorectal tumors, the most frequently observed mutation was Kras, followed by p53, and PIK3CA. Among NSCLC', ' p53, PIK3CA, deletion of p16 and mutation of Kras. In melanoma', ' Braf and deletion of p16. All 30 cases of pancreatic cancer showed mutations, being Kras the most frequent, followed by p16 deletion and p53 mutation. On the other tumor types, not more than three samples displayed the same mutation. A subgroup of the samples (95) was validated for mutations with other two techniques', \" conventional Sanger sequencing and/or IonAmpliseq Cancer panel (a panel of key cancer related genes, Life Technologies). 56/69 (81%) cases had the same mutation(s) detected by two or three techniques simultaneously. Three samples were concordantly wild type for the evaluated genes by three or two techniques. Comparison of the genetic alterations with the demographic and clinicopathological data available for these samples (including tumor stage, therapy response, patient's gender and age) is underway to evaluate possible correlations among these parameters and the molecular changes.With the recent massive data produced by next generation sequencing, and with our growing knowledge on the applicability of genetic alterations in the clinic, it is important to have cost-effective, easy straight- forward to perform and to analyze techniques in order to profile the tumors for relevant mutations on the era of personalized medicine.In the present work, we assess a quick and simple, real time PCR based method with selected targets for mutation detection and compare with two other widely used methods. Moreover we aim to profile tumors and uncover their possible genetic targets to best utilize our powerful investigational method of TumorGrafts.Further studies with larger cohorts and alternative mutation detection techniques are needed to validate and expand the present results.\"]",

A high nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors is associated with improved response to checkpoint blockade. In this study we determined the relationship of several altered genes/pathways in solid tumor samples that appeared to be significantly mutated (SM). Methods', ' Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on 374 advanced solid tumor samples. Targeted sequencing was performed on 562 cancer associated genes, and analysis of matched tumor-normal DNA was performed to filter out germline variants and identify true somatic mutations. Samples with greater than 17 mutations were considered SM based on extrapolation from other reports and considering the number of genes interrogated by our panel. Results', ' Our analysis revealed that 13% (48/374) of tumors were significantly mutated, exhibiting 17 or greater nonsynonymous mutations occurring in a wide variety of solid tumors including but not limited to lung, CRC and melanoma. Over 90% of mutations were either frameshift, missense or splice site alterations, which may result in tumor-specific neoantigens and increased amounts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Loss of function mutations in MMR genes indicative of MMR deficiency which has been associated with increased response to immune checkpoint blockade were present in 21% (10/48) of SM cases. Mutations in polymerase e (POLE), indicative of high neoantigen load, were identified in 17% (8/48) of SM cases. Genes in SWI/SNF pathway were mutated in 65% (31/48) of SM cases, which included loss of function mutations in ARID1A. Mutations in DNA repair genes, including homologous recombination, base excision and nucleotide excision repair pathway, were noted in over half of the cases with the hypermutant phenotype. Conclusions', ' Our findings suggest that 13% of solid tumors have high nonsynonymous mutation burden which may be associated with benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

        "Background":"['MDM2 protein is often found over-expressed in cancers with wild-type p53. A single nucleotide polymorphism (T to G) near the mdm2 P2 promoter, mdm2 SNP309, leads to MDM2 overexpression. This polymorphism is associated with accelerated tumor formation, decreased sensitivity to DNA damage treatment and compromised p53 transcriptional activity. Two G/G SNP309 cell lines MANCA (Burkitt lymphoma) and A875 (melanoma) express wild-type p53 protein not readily degraded by MDM2. This wild-type p53 does not activate target genes even after DNA damage. During the blocked transcription, MDM2 and p53 co-localize at p53 response elements on chromatin. Therefore, we hypothesized that MDM2 localized with p53 on the chromatin was the contributing factor for the compromised p53 transcriptional activity. We explored the mechanism for compromised p53 transcriptional activity in these G/G SNP309 cancer cell lines. When compared to fully activated wild-type p53 in ML-1 cells treated with etoposide, MANCA and A875 cell lines had comparable recruitment of total and initiated RNA pol II at transcription start sites (TSS) for p21 and puma genes. This indicated that G/G SNP309 cells had functional transcription initiation at p53 target genes after DNA damage treatment. We next assessed epigenetic modifications associated with active transcriptional elongation. Using H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) as a hallmark for active elongation, we observed that ML-1 cells had a substantial increase in H3K36me3 after etoposide treatment at p21 and puma TSS that was not seen in MANCA or A875 cell lines. This lack of H3K36me3 suggested an inhibition in early transcriptional elongation. To address the participation of MDM2 in the elongation block we created a stable MDM2 knockdown MANCA cell line. Interestingly, MDM2 knockdown drastically increased MDMX protein levels and moderately increased activation of p53 target genes implying MDMX played a redundant role for MDM2. We are currently investigating the roles of MDM2 and MDMX in blocking transcriptional elongation. Interestingly, we have found that treatment of MANCA cells with low dose Actinomycin D reactivates the p53 pathway and studies are in progress to determine if this is through activation of transcriptional elongation.This work was supported by The Breast Cancer Research Foundation and The National Science Foundation (grant MCB-0744316) to J.B.

        "Background":"['Activation of p53 is an attractive therapeutic target in radiation oncology because of its tumor-suppressor activity. AMG 232 is an effective p53 activator via inhibition of p53 interaction with its primary negative regulator, MDM2. In the current study, we examine the capacity of AMG 232 to augment radiation response in a variety of human tumors derived from lung, breast, colorectal, melanoma and sarcoma.We first examined the anti-proliferative effect of AMG 232 and confirmed a dose-dependent growth inhibition following AMG 232 treatment across a panel of 7 cell lines harboring wild type p53. In addition, the lack of growth inhibition in a p53 null cell line H1299 confirmed the p53-dependent anti-proliferative effect of AMG 232. Using clonogenic survival analysis, we identified that treatment with AMG 232 significantly enhanced radiosensitivity in all cell lines tested. Immunoblot analysis revealed the capacity of AMG 232 to inhibit radiation-induced DNA damage repair via inhibition of ATM, DNAPK-DNA ligase IV and BRCA1-Rad51/52 pathways. Flow cytometric analysis also showed a significant accumulation of cell populations in G2/M phase and a strong increase in H2AX expression at 48 hrs following 2 Gy of radiation and AMG 232 treatment. Consistently, AMG 232 was shown to activate 1433 that blocked G2/M progression via inhibiting CDC2. Further imaging studies to detect senescence-associated -galactosidase activity identified that combined treatment of AMG 232 and radiation significantly induced a senescence phenotype. These results suggest that AMG 232 augments radiation response via the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or senescence followed by cell death, likely reflecting inhibitory effects on DNA damage repair. In addition to increased apoptotic cell death following the combination treatment, we found that autophagy-related cell death may also be contributing to AMG 232-induced radiosensitivity. Finally, in a variety of human tumor xenograft models, we confirmed that the combination of AMG 232 and radiation resulted in a significant delay in tumor regrowth and superior anti-tumor efficacy than treatment with drug or radiation alone. Taken together, these data reveal the strong capacity of AMG 232 to augment radiation response across a variety of tumor types. These promising results provide a basis for the further investigation of MDM2 antagonists combined with radiation as a novel treatment approach in cancer therapy.']",

We now report on the entire cohort of 412 fresh-frozen, chemotherapy-nave tumors. Included in the analysis were paired blood and/or tumor-adjacent tissue samples. This is the largest sequencing project on bladder cancer to date. After strict clinical and pathologic quality control, tumors were analyzed for DNA copy number variants, somatic mutations, DNA methylation, mRNA, microRNA and (phospho-) protein expression, transcript splicing, gene fusions, viral integration, APOBEC mutagenesis, pathway perturbation, clinical correlates, and histopathology.Results', ' There was a high overall somatic mutation rate (8.0/Mb), with a median of 245 and mean of 348 coding-region mutations per sample. That is the third highest mutation rate among the cancer types profiled by TCGA (after cutaneous melanoma and non-small cell lung cancers). We identified 54 genes as significantly mutated, compared with 32 in the original report on 131 tumors. TP53 mutations were the most common (49%), and also quite common were mutations in a number of chromatin-modifying genes, including MLL2 (29%), KDM6A (26%), ARID1A (25%), MLL3 (19%), EP300 (15%), CREBBP (12%), and MLL (11%). Other cancer-related genes showing frequent mutations included PIK3CA (22%), RB1 (17%), FGFR3 (14%), STAG2 (14%), ATM (14%), ELF3 (12%), FAT1 (12%), SPTAN1 (12%), ERBB2 (12%), ERBB3 (11%), ASXL2 (10%), ERCC2 (9%), CDKN1A (9%), TSC1 (8%), CDKN2A (7%), RHOB (6%), NFE2L2 (6%), PARD3 (6%), FAM47C (5%), RBM10 (5%),HRAS (5%), KRAS (4%), and PTEN (3%). High mutation burden was associated with improved outcome (p = 0.0004). APOBEC mutagenesis explained 70% of the mutation burden and was associated with survival. Gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation was identified in 167 genes with at least 5% frequency in the cohort. The previously identified four mRNA expression subtypes were again found in the complete set of 412 tumors, and the proportions of samples in each subtype were similar to the previous proportions. Reverse-phase proteomic array analysis of 344 of the samples revealed clusters associated with diagnostic subtype, pathological stage, and grade but not with smoking history or non-muscle invasive status.Conclusions', ' This integrated molecular analysis of 412 TCGA tumor samples largely validates and considerably extends observations from the initial cohort of 131 patients. The larger cohort significantly increased our power to detect lower-frequency aberrations that were not identified in the original cohort. The results provide a robust basis for further functional studies of bladder cancer biology and also provide additional incisive information for the identification of molecular targets for therapy.']",

In recent years, we have developed a collection of >40 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from PDAC. In order to determine their relevance for anticancer agent testing, we extensively characterized our models for histology features, whole exome mutations (Hiseq 2000), chromosome rearrangements, gene copy number variations (Affymetrix SNP6) and gene expression (Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0).PDAC from 65 patients were implanted into immuno-compromised mice, resulting in the development of 42 PDX models (success rate 65%). The PDAC from which models were established included moderate and poorly differentiated tumors and were heterogeneous for stroma content. In patient tumors, we showed fibroblast activation but not stroma content predicted poor patient outcome (p<0.0001) and success of PDX establishment (p<0.01). Correlating with those of the parental tumors, the resulting PDAC_PDX also showed heterogeneity for stroma content and for murine fibroblast activation. As seen in patient tumors, the PDAC_PDX were characterized by frequent chromosomal instability, with 38% of the models presenting a moderate hypoploidy while the 62% remaining ones showed a hyperploidy. Two models showed hypermutation due to mismatch repair deficiency while the others had on average a lower mutation load when compared to other histotypes such as colon, lung or melanoma tumors. In total, we identified more than 9000 genes altered by homozygous deletions, high gene amplifications and/or mutations, most of the models showed alterations in KRAS (81%), TP53 (67%), CDKN2A (64%) and TGFBR2/SMAD4 (64%) genes. Next, PDAC_PDX profiles were merged with those of patient tumors to determine PDAC_PDX subtypes and were found to be of the classical (61%), quasi mesenchymal (QM) (34%) and exocrine like subtype (5%) according to the 62 gene expression signature established by Collisson et al. 2011. Preliminary biomarker analysis revealed certain associations between genomic alterations and transcriptome subtypes, such as more frequent alterations in the TGFB pathway in classical PDX (80%) compared to QM (47%). Further detailed biomarkers analyses also addressing questions of molecular determinants of stroma content, of fibroblast activation and of sensitivity toward anticancer agents will be presented.Extensive characterization of our PDAC_PDX collection revealed similarities with patient tumors with regards of histology features including stroma content and fibroblast activation. At molecular level, the models showed similar genomic and transcriptomic patterns as those reported for patient PDAC, altogether, proving the value of this collection for drug development investigations.']",

        "Background":"[\"This presentation aims at summarizing today's knowledge on tumor reversion (ref.1) with recent applications and new findings for potential cancer treatment. In order to study the molecular program of tumor reversion we have provided with a series of biological models. In this approach, we derived revertant cells from tumor cell lines ranging from leukemia to solid tumors such as breast, colon, lung cancer and melanoma. Using differential gene profiling, between the parental tumor cells and the revertants, over 300 genes were identified, as implicated in reversion such as Siah-1, TSAP6, PS1 and most importantly Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TPT1/TCTP) (ref. 2). Notably TPT1/TCTP is highly expressed in the tumor cells and almost undetectable in the revertants. Knocking down TPT1/TCTP reorganized breast cancer cells into ductal structures reminiscent of normal breast morphology. More recently, we identified a strong reciprocal repressive feedback loop between TPT1/TCTP and p53 (ref.3). P53 represses the transcription of TPT1/TCTP by binding to the promoter of TPT1/TCTP. Conversely, TPT1/TCTP interacts directly with p53, Numb and MDM2. TPT1/TCTP competes with Numb. Importantly, TPT1/TCTP stabilizes MDM2, promoting hereby MDM2-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p53. Screening of a large cohort of breast cancer patients (508) shows high expression of TPT1/TCTP in the most aggressive G3 tumors, predicting poor prognosis. TPT1/TCTP is also highly expressed in normal and cancer breast stem cells. Decreasing TPT1/TCTP by siRNA in a mammosphere assay significantly reduces the colony forming efficiency. Thus, TPT1/TCTP also regulates the stem cell compartment. We found two drugs, Sertraline and Thioridazine, which bind and inactivate TPT1/TCTP, restoring elevated levels of wild type p53. Pilot studies on ex vivo cells derived from AML-patients indicate that Sertraline and Ara-C act synergistically in reducing the viability of AML cells. The implication of tumor reversion in reprogramming cancer cells and in disclosing new therapeutic targets as well as its potential role in tumor heterogeneity will be discussed.\"]",

Deletion and uniparental disomy of the NDN gene is causally associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome, a congenital neuro-developmental disorder. Studies of brain development suggest that NDN functions as a suppressor of neuronal growth. Recent studies have shown that NDN gene expression is downregulated in melanoma and urothelial cancers, indicating that it may also act as a tumor suppressor gene. We have now found that NDN gene expression is also downregulated in 50% of 14 ovarian tumors and 9 out of 10 ovarian cancer cell lines. Hypermethylation of 2 CpG sites in NDN promoter was detected in 5 out of 10 cell lines by pyrosequencing, and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment revived NDN expression at different levels, suggesting that DNA hypermethylation is one of the mechanisms of NDN downregulation. Re-expression of the NDN gene product Necdin in SKOv3 ovarian cancer cells significantly inhibited growth by clonogenic assays associated with upregulation of caspase-3 activity. Expression of Necdin did not induce autophagy. As SKOv3 cells are p53 null, the mechanism(s) by which Necdin induces cell death is independent of p53 activity. Our observations that Necdin expression is downregulated in majority of ovarian cancers and cancer cell lines and that re-expression of Necdin inhibited cancer cell growth support the notion that NDN is a tumor suppressor gene.']",

Due to the shortcomings of gemcitabine and the presence of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer, the development of targeted agents into an anti-neoplastic agent remains a viable option.We have investigated the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-), which is known to play a central role in pancreas cell function. We have already observed that the suppression of TGF-2 induced an unexpected down-regulation of both TGF-1 and TGF-3 with concomitant decreases of survival-related signals, such as N-caderin, -catenin, pp65 in melanoma cell line. Here, two different pancreatic cancer cell lines (HPAC, BxPC3), which have opposite genetic backgrounds (K-ras, p53, Smad4, EGFR), have shown differing sensitivities to the down-regulation of TGF-2. Through transcriptome analysis, HPAC showed a high expression of TGF-2, MUC4, HSP27, BMP4 which are deeply related to tumor progression and metastasis and are composed to core signaling complex initiating from TGF-2. This was confirmed by TGF-2 down-regulation with gemcitabine to show a greater decrease in survival potential compared to BxPC3. On the contrary, BxPC3, which has more of the mutant type p53, exhibited greater down-regulation of MUC4 by downregulation of p53 compared to that of TGF-2. Such observations suggest that BxPC3 is composed of a different core signaling pathway, p53-MUC4 rather than TGF-2-related signalings.In conclusion, it is necessary that the core signaling pathways which are implicated in individual pancreatic carcinogenesis are more specifically considered so that the various gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells on the basis of customized treatment can be controlled.']",

It was determined by flow cytometry that S2AMN works by arresting cell-cycle progression in the G1 phase. Using RT-PCR, the p53 gene was shown to be up regulated in the cells during G1 phase, suggesting that S2AMN is p53 dependent. Using DNA extraction and agarose gel electrophoresis the DNA of cells treated with S2AMN was found partially degraded after 24 hours and completely degraded after 48 hours. Viability analysis showed a dose-dependent growth curve; 24 hours after treatment there was a marked decrease in viability and within 48 hours there was complete cell death (control viability > 94%). Results from viability analyses supported the same conclusion as the DNA electrophoresis data, namely that within 48 hours there was complete DNA degradation and apoptosis. We also examined the proliferation rate at 24 and 48 hours, and found that proliferation decreased at 24 hours and completely stopped at 48 hours. One of the more striking characteristics of S2AMN is its cancer-specific cytotoxicity. After treating human lymphocytes induced with PHA (normal cells) with the same concentrations of S2AMN as shown above, cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle flow cytometry, and RT-PCR experiments were performed. Results showed that there was no significant change between treatment and control cells. In conclusion, S2AMN seems to be selectively cytotoxic by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells.

Unfortunately, response to first generation checkpoint blockade therapy is limited to a subset of patients. A more comprehensive understanding of the genes and molecules involved in T cell checkpoint control and other aspects of anti-tumor T cell activity may allow a wider patient population to benefit from this exciting and new approach to cancer therapy.To this end, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify gene pathways that influence intratumoral T cell infiltration using Sleeping Beauty (SB) mutagenesis. More specifically, this genetic T cell screen was designed to identify additional genes and molecules responsible for selection and expansion of intratumoral T cells via a variety of T cell processes including T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation, clonal expansion of tumor-specific T cells, T cell trafficking into the tumor, and maintenance of prolonged viability once there. Advantages of using SB in a genetic screen include the ability to cause both gain- and loss-of-function mutations, as well as mutagenesis of the entire genome followed by easy identification of insertion sites. In addition, SB screens are performed in vivo, and thus preserve the complexity of the tumor microenvironment.We generated a pilot cohort of mice (n = 12) with SB-mutagenized endogenous T cells. These mice were challenged with syngeneic B16F0 melanoma cells subcutaneously. After tumor development (21 days after tumor challenge), tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were harvested. Splenic T cells representing unselected CD4+ and CD8+ populations were also isolated from the same animals at time of tumor harvest. Harvested T cells were evaluated by high throughput sequencing to identify SB insertion sites. T cells harvested from tumors demonstrated a decrease in clonal insertion sites compared to splenic T cells suggesting intratumoral clonal selection. Moreover, clonal insertions in intratumoral T cells were significantly enriched in or near genes, signifying likely selection for insertions impacting gene function (p<0.000003, Fisher's exact test). Clonal insertion sites in T cells from tumors that were absent from spleens, representing potential immunotherapy targets and including insertion sites in genes known to be associated with the T cell response, were identified. We are currently in the process of expanding this experimental cohort using a larger number of mice.We conclude T cell specific SB mutagenesis has the potential to identify novel molecules that influence intratumoral T cell infiltration and can be used to identify additional genes that may contribute to the anti-tumor T cell response.\"]",

        "Background":"['Histiocytic Sarcomas (HS) are rare neoplasms derived from hematopoietic or mesenchymal stem cells and are known to have a poor prognosis. Primary lesions of HS appear in the spleen, lymph nodes, lung, bone marrow, skin and hypodermis. The definitive cell of origin, genetic etiology, and critical drug targets for HS therapy are unknown. To address all three questions we have utilized a forward genetic screening method in mice that can identify mutations capable of causing cancer initiation and progression. The forward genetic screen uses the Sleeping Beauty (SB) DNA transposon as a random somatic mutagen, capable of both activating proto-oncogenes and inactivating tumor suppressor genes. The system relies on the use of a Cre/LoxP-regulated SB transposase transgene and mutagenic transposon vector transgenes that are mobilized by the transposase. Using Cre recombinase under the control of a tissue specific promoter allows for selective, tissue specific mutagenesis in particular cells of interest. Tumors generated in these mice are analyzed for recurrent transposon insertion sites (called common insertion sites or CIS) using ligation-mediated PCR in combination with high-throughput sequencing. As in human cancer, our results often reveal a small number of frequently mutated genes that cooperate with a greater number of rare mutant genes that drive formation of tumors. We hypothesized that SB-mediated transposition of an oncogenic transposon in myeloid lineage cells in mice could cause mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to the initiation and progression of HS. We generated and aged 190 experimental and control transgenic mice. The triple transgenic, experimental mice express SB transposase in myeloid lineage cells containing an oncogenic transposon by virtue of a Cre recombinase transgene under the control of the Lysozyme M promoter, which is expressed in committed myeloid lineage cells. Remarkably, triple transgenic mice became moribund much faster than controls. Histopathology suggests 30% of the experimental mice developed HS. We have performed immunohistochemistry to confirm the tumor type using antibodies to Mac-2, F4/80 and PAX5. Tumors were analyzed by mapping transposon insertions to the mouse genome from many independently generated tumors. We mapped 1,177 non-redundant insertions and generated a list of 23 candidate HS genes comprised of known cancer genes as well as novel candidate genes. Our top 3 hits are Raf1 and Fli1, known oncogenes associated with hematological neoplasms, and Mitf, a transcription factor associated with melanoma. Our list also includes known tumor suppressors Trp53 and Nf1. Our results show that 1', ' A mature myeloid lineage cell can serve as a target cell for HS. 2', ' ETS and basic helix-loop-helix (hHLH)-leucine zipper transcription factor networks can induce HS with Raf-activated pathways And 3', ' RAF-MEK-ERK signaling is likely a useful target for HS treatment.']",

Here we report the analytical validation of the Ion AmpliSeq v2 Cancer Panel (ACP) in plasma ctDNA samples.Methods', 'Mutations were assessed using the ACP, designed to survey 2800 mutations in 50 cancer-related genes. TruQ reference standards were used to determine LOD. Healthy donor and cancer patient plasma samples were used for other studies. Eight libraries were barcoded and sequenced with PGM sequencing 200 kit v2 on a 318 v2 chip. The sequencing data were analyzed with a combination of Torrent Suite 3.4.2, VarScan, our proprietary analysis pipeline and IGV. The background noise level of hotspot nt positions was calculated from multiple runs of known wild type DNA. In order to increase the sensitivity of the assay to detect low-level mutation, a custom program was developed to detect variants clearly different from background noise (95% confidence) and not reported by the two variant callers. PCR methods were used for concordance testing.Results', 'The performance characteristics of the AmpliSeq v2 Cancer Panel were demonstrated in 1) Minimum DNA input and LOD', ' With 10 ng DNA input, 43/43 and 42/43 expected mutations were detected at 2.5% or 1%, respectively. With 1 ng DNA input, 42/43 and 40/43 expected mutations were detected at 2.5% and 1%, respectively. 2) Coverage', ' The mean library coverage for 40 plasma libraries was 2912x with only 5 non-critical regions below 250x coverage. 3) Baseline error rate', ' 95% of 2290 hot-spots for SBS showed <0.5% background error frequency assessed in 10 healthy control ctDNA samples. The mean background error frequency plus two folds of SD falls below 0.5% for 91% of SBS hot-spots. 4)Precision', ' All mutations expected for TruQ6 were detected in 4 independent runs at observed allele frequencies with 0.6% mean SD and 0.1% mean deviation from the true value. A 2% TP53 mutation R174W was reproducibly detected in a lung cancer plasma sample in 2 independent runs. 5) Concordance study', ' Consistent results were observed for 3 positive (Allele Freq 40%, 3% and 0.2%, respectively) and 3 negative melanoma plasma samples previously genotyped by AS-PCR for Braf V600E/K mutations. Additional cancer patient ctDNA samples are being assessed for concordance in the detection of other mutations.Conclusions', 'The ACP offers a useful tool for comprehensive somatic mutation profiling in ctDNA. The limit of detection is 1-2% mutation frequency for most mutations with slight variation across different nucleotide positions. The low concentration of ctDNA obtained from plasma samples can present a challenge. Less than 10 ng DNA input may result in allele drop out for low level mutations due to the inefficient amplification of multiplex PCR compared with PCR methods using a short length single amplicon. Higher DNA input to rescue allele drop-out is under evaluation.']",

        "Background":"['Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer and consists of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SCC metastases account for up to 20% of all deaths from skin cancer. The major risk factor for the development of NMSC is solar ultraviolet radiation (UV). UVA and UVB both function as initiators and promoters in carcinogenesis and possess immunosuppressive activity. Given the prevalence of this disease, there remains a pressing need for the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies for NMSC.In a recent study (Srivastava et al. 2015. Mol. Carcinog. doi', '10.1002/mc.22335), we evaluated the effect of Twist1, a transcription factor that is known to play a role in tumor progression, during epithelial carcinogenesis. Using the two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model, we identified that BK5.Cre x Twist1flox/flox mice, which have a keratinocyte-specific Twist1 knockout (Twist1 KO), developed significantly reduced numbers of papillomas (70% reduction) and SCCs (75% reduction) as well as delayed tumor latency compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Twist1 KO mice also exhibited significantly reduced epidermal proliferation in response to chemical promotion that correlated with reduced levels of cell cycle regulators and increased levels of p53 and p21.In further studies, we have begun analyzing the effects of UVB irradiation in Twist1 KO mice. Specifically, Twist1 KO mice exhibited heightened sensitivity to UVB-induced apoptosis and decreased epidermal proliferation as compared to similarly exposed WT mice. In addition, the accumulation of mast cells in the skin was significantly decreased in Twist1 KO mice as compared to WT mice. Further preliminary experiments showed that the protein expression levels of c-Myc, phospho-p65 (S536) and phospho-p50 (S337) decreased following UVB irradiation whereas levels of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 exhibited an increased expression in Twist1 KO mice as compared to WT mice. Further experiments have suggested that Twist1 may play a pivotal role in the proliferation/migration of bulge region keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) following exposure to UVB. These and other results from ongoing experiments will be presented. Collectively, these findings suggest that Twist1 may have a novel role in UVB-induced epithelial carcinogenesis by regulating proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and KSCs.

        "Background":"['Topoisomerases are highly specialized nuclear enzymes that remove superhelical tension on chromosomal DNA that allows replication and transcription of DNA. Many cancer chemotherapeutic drugs used in the clinics inhibit tumor growth by targeting topoisomerase functions resulting in DNA damage and cancer cell death. Cryptolepine, a major alkaloid isolated from Cryptolepis sanguinolenta plant’s roots, has shown anti-malarial, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we examined the therapeutic effect of cryptolepine on non-melanoma skin cancer cells (NMSCC), SCC-13 and A431 as an in vitro model, and underlying mechanism of action with special emphasis on topoisomerases and DNA damage check points. Western blot analysis and enzyme activity evaluation assays demonstrated that SCC-13 and A431 cells express comparatively higher levels of topoisomerases and higher enzymatic activities compared with normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). Topoisomerase expression and activity was greatly reduced after 24 h treatment with 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 µM cryptolepine. Inhibition of topoisomerases expression and function by cryptolepine resulted in significant DNA damage and enhanced expression of DNA-PK expressions. Cryptolepine induced DNA damage activated DNA damage response proteins as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of ATM/ATR, BRCA1, Chk1/Chk2 and γH2AX. Consequences of cryptolepine induced DNA damage were also associated with activation of p53 signaling cascade. Cryptolepine induced post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation of p53, and inhibition of mdm2 protein expression resulted in activation and accumulation of p53 in SCC-13 and A431 cells. In turn, activated p53 enhanced protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 and p21. Activation of p16 and p21 proteins downregulated expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E and thus induced S-phase cell cycle arrest in NMSC cells with reduced expression of cell division proteins Cdc25a and Cdc25b. Cryptolepine treatment also enhanced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria due to increased disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of topoisomerase activity and activation of DNA damage response signaling culminated in significantly reduced cell viability and enhanced cell death of SCC-13 and A431 cells. However, NHEK cells were least sensitive to cryptolepine induced cell death. Results of our study strongly suggest for detailed preclinical investigations in animal models to further assess its anti-skin cancer potential and its possible use in human patients.']",

        "Background":"['When telomeres are disrupted, exposure of the single stranded 3 overhang triggers DNA damage pathways resulting in cell senescence and apoptosis. T-oligo, an oligonucleotide homologous to the 3 overhang, mimics telomere exposure inducing p53 /p73 associated damage responses in malignant cells with negligible effects on normal tissues. To test the ability of T-oligo as a therapeutic agent, subcutaneous NSCLC tumors were established in nude mice which were given daily intratumoral injections (60 nmoles) of T-oligo or a complementary oligonucleotide for 6 weeks. SW1573 and H358 tumors treated with T-oligo exhibited a 5.6 and 4.3 fold reduction in tumor size respectively. Examination of tumor sections for senescence using -galactosidase revealed that both H358 and SW1573 exhibited strong staining for senescence compared to controls. Staining for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in H358 and SW1573 displayed 2.2 fold and 3 fold reduction, respectively. These results indicate that T-oligo not only reduced tumor size and vessel density, but also induced senescence suggesting that T-oligo, may be a molecularly targeted cancer therapy. To test the efficacy of T-oligo after IV delivery subcutaneous melanoma tumors were treated with IV T-oligo (78 nmoles) for 4 weeks which resulted in a 3.7 fold reduction in T-oligo treated tumor volume. These tumors are further being evaluated for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The role of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, tankyrase-1, in T-oligo mediated DNA damage responses was assessed using XAV939, a tankyrase inhibitor. Tankyrase-1 parsylates TRF1, releasing it from the telomere, allowing telomerase to access telomeric DNA thereby increasing telomere length. TRF1, a protein associated with the protective telomere T-loop structure, negatively controls telomere length. Since TRF1 plays a role in the stability of the shelterin complex (a specialized set of proteins responsible for maintaining the DNA T-loop structure), immunoblots were made for AN (melanoma) and H358 (lung cancer) cell lines and probed for TRF1. Preliminary results indicate 1.7 fold downregulation of TRF1 upon treatment with T-oligo and a negligible difference in the presence of a combination of T-oligo and XAV939. T-oligo treatment also induced a 2.6 fold upregulation of TRF-2 and treatment with T-oligo and XAV939 reduced this upregulation to 1 fold suggesting that T-oligo may only stabilizes part of the free shelterin complex and the rest is degraded by the cell. These results suggest that tankyrase-1 maybe involved in T-oligo mediated signaling and maybe associated with the shelterin complex upon parsylation of TRF1.']",

        "Background":"['The INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus on human chromosome 9p21 is a hot spot genomic region that undergoes frequent inactivation or deletion in a wide spectrum of human cancers. The locus encodes three cell cycle inhibitory proteins', ' p15INK4b encoded by CDKN2b, p16INK4a encoded by CDKN2a and p14ARF (p19Arf in mice) encoded by an alternative reading frame (ARF) of CDKN2a. We have recently identified a homologous INK4 genomic locus in zebrafish that is surprisingly devoid of ARF sequences, and encodes a single zebrafish ink4ab gene that functions to activate stress-induced senescence. Therefore, evolution of the mammalian INK4 locus to include multiple tumor suppressors sharing regulatory features could attribute to stronger mechanisms of tumor suppression in these longer-lived vertebrates. Oxidative and/or oncogenic stress provokes cellular senescence involving the retinoblastoma (Rb) and ARF/p53 pathways, leading to silencing of growth-promoting genes by methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) with the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. We found that ink4ab deficient zebrafish had deregulated Rb signaling and senescence responses, and reduced suv39h1 expression levels that led to poor overall survival. Ink4ab deficient zebrafish had increased lymphocyte proliferation, splenomegaly, and developed multiple spontaneous tumors including metastatic melanoma, osteosarcoma, hepatocellular adenoma, leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders. Moreover, zebrafish heterozygous for both p53 and ink4ab mutations displayed significantly higher tumor incidence compared to p53 heterozygotes with wild-type ink4ab, indicating that ink4ab haploinsufficiency promotes tumorigenesis. To this end, the combined deficiency of ink4ab and p53 accelerates tumor latency, likely by reversing cellular senescence responses. To further examine ARF-independent senescence regulatory roles of INK4 products in a mammalian model, we have generated conditional mice deficient for all three INK4 open reading frames in the adult hematopoietic system. Within seven months, homozygous Ink4a/Ink4b/ARF-/- mice exhibited marked splenomegaly and developed spontaneous tumors, including leukemias and soft tissue sarcomas. Peripheral blood, splenic and bone marrow analyses of homozygous mutant mice showed deregulated lymphocyte development, uncontrolled proliferation, apoptosis and Suv39h1-dependent senescence when compared to heterozygous and wild type mice. These results identify ARF-independent and Suv39h1-dependent senescence regulatory and tumor suppressor mechanisms whose inactivation permits tumor formation in response to oncogenic and/or oxidative stress. Our models offer the opportunity to reveal novel paradigms for promoting cellular senescence as an alternative strategy for cancer prevention and therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant brain tumor. Current standard treatment for GBM following maximum safe resection includes temozolomide (TMZ) with concurrent radiotherapy. Despite the improvement of survival by TMZ and radiation, the overall prognosis remains poor for GBM patients. This is partially attributed to drug resistance. Expression of DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) in gliomas confers TMZ resistance and a worse prognosis. Therefore, development of novel therapy to suppress MGMT expression and overcome TMZ resistance is highly desired. Hyperthermia has been shown to increase TMZ sensitivity in melanoma and this provides a good rationale to evaluate whether hyperthermia overcomes TMZ resistance in glioblastoma cells.In this study, we investigated the effect of hyperthermia treatment (43C) on TMZ sensitivity of four human glioblastoma cell lines using clonogenic assays. Our results showed that hyperthermia treatment increased TMZ-induced cell death in TMZ-resistant glioma cells, but had no additional beneficial effect in the TMZ-sensitive cells. Hyperthermia in combination with radiation further overcame TMZ resistance. To study the molecular targets, we found that hyperthermia downregulated MGMT expression through increasing proteasome-mediated MGMT degradation, which can be reversed by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Hyperthermia had no effects on p53 expression and MGMT promoter methylation which was responsible for MGMT gene silencing. In addition, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis showed an increase of TMZ and its downstream product 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) in hyperthermia-treated cells, indicating an increase of TMZ drug uptake and breakdown.In conclusion, these results suggest that hyperthermia overcomes MGMT-mediated resistance of glioblastoma cell lines to TMZ and increases TMZ drug uptake. This study suggests a potential benefit of using hyperthermia in the treatment of GBM, particularly those with more adverse prognosis.This work was supported by Debrule Research Fund.']",

These compounds demonstrate substantially enhanced hydrolytic stability, as well as cytotoxic activity towards a variety of cancer cell lines in vitro. The IC50 of different derivatives of these compounds towards murine mammary carcinoma, lymphoma, multi-drug resistant lymphoma, as well as human leukemia, melanoma and pancreatic cancer cell lines, is in the range of 0.6 - 5.7M, as compared to 70-100M of the older titanium compounds and to 50-60M of cisplatin (Manna C.M. et al.

        "Background":"['The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a program elicited by mammalian cells to attenuate global translation in response to a variety of stressors. There are four branches of the ISR, including those mediated by PERK, which responds to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and GCN2, which is activated by amino acid deprivation. Activation of these kinases ultimately leads to translational upregulation of the transcription factor ATF4, which modulates the expression of genes involved in amino acid transport and synthesis, oxidative stress, and differentiation. Complete abrogation of the ISR or its overactivation by pharmacological agents in the presence of hypoxic or nutrient stress has been shown to lead to cell death. Here, we employed a small molecule screen to identify modulators of ATF4 expression via a reporter construct with the 5-UTR of ATF4 fused to the luciferase gene. From this screen, a compound with ATF4-activating properties was identified. Multiple assays have been used to characterize the effects of this drug, referred to as E235, on both transformed and normal cells. Specifically, we have shown that E235 induces the ISR in a dose-dependent manner in tumor cell lines (HT1080 fibrosarcoma, B16F10 melanoma) but not in normal human diploid cells. The drug also reduces cell viability and proliferation at low M concentrations, which does not appear to be dependent on apoptosis. By performing live cell microscopy, we observed that after prolonged (>24h) treatment with 1M E235, the majority of cells displayed senescence-like morphology. This was confirmed by additional experiments, such as staining for senescence-associated -galactosidase activity and immunoblotting for the upregulation of the cdk inhibitor p21.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer remains a major cause of cancer mortality. Malignant lesions are normally endogenously corrected by the immune surveillance system. However, tumors evade this immunity by inducing immunosuppressive microenvironments during cancer progression. It has been thought that there are two critical components of tumors making them capable of maintaining the immunosuppressive microenvironment. One is the inhibition of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity against the tumor through immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1 (PD-1), which are negative regulators of CTL, and the other is by the induction of tumor infiltrating immune suppressive cells, which can deactivate the CTL. Recent studies demonstrate that multiple cancer types, including melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder, and stomach, respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1 and PD-1 with 11-30% response rates and durable responses. However, a substantial number of patients still fail to respond to immunotherapy and the refractory mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we focus on KRas-driven lung cancers, as there are no clinically effective targeted drugs available for treating this type of lung cancer. We demonstrate that during the progression of tumors in KRas mutation and p53 knockout-driven lung cancer mouse models; KRasG12D/+;p53-/- (KP), there is a gradual increase in the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and that the combination of either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody along with a MEK inhibitor, which targets downstream of KRas signaling, shows anticancer efficacy in these animal models. These combinations, in comparison to either single agent alone, effectively blocks the growth of subcutaneously (s.c.) injected syngeneic mouse lung cancer cells in immune competent transgenic KP mice, significantly increasing the survival rates', ' 37.5% (for anti-PD-1 antibody and MEK inhibitor), 62.5% (for anti-PD-L1 antibody and MEK inhibitor) vs. 0% single agents or control at the end of treatment. We find that the tumors in the control treated group harbor a substantial number of immune cells, including PD-L1 expressing MDSC. The combination treatment with either an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody along with a MEK inhibitor dramatically modulates the composition and the activity of tumor infiltrated immune cells. Tumors in the combined treated group show a significant decrease in PD-L1 expressing MDSC in comparison with control tumors. Additionally, a combined treatment would block the PD-L1 activity of the infiltrated PD-L1 expressing MDSC in malignant tumors and thus lead to improved survival. These results point to a potential therapeutic opportunity for currently untargetable KRas-driven lung cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Early detection of cancer is a critical factor for successful treatment of cancer patients. Autoantibody signatures have value in the diagnosis and management of autoimmune disorders and may be valuable for detection of cancers. Previous groups have applied several techniques to identify cancer-specific autoimmune responses with varying degrees of success. A lack of high throughput methods to rapidly screen large numbers of patient samples and validate multiple antigens of interest is an important bottleneck in the development of autoantibodies as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis.We tested normal and cancer patient sera against protein arrays generated using a gene library capable of expressing full-length human proteins. Autoantibodies against proteins in these arrays were identified using electrochemiluminescence detection technology from MSD, a proven technology for high-throughput, array-based measurements. This approach offers key advantages over existing array-based approaches by providing a high-throughput, sensitive, and specific assay platform, with large-scale protein arrays. This approach also enables a rapid transition from antigen discovery to clinical validation using small focused arrays on the same diagnostic platform.Protein arrays containing 7,000 unique (non-redundant) full-length human proteins were generated using a eukaryotic expression system. This set of proteins represents a significant portion (28-35%) of the human proteome. We estimate that greater than 80% of autoantibodies recognize unmodified epitopes on single protein antigens; the protein arrays, therefore, should be highly representative of the vast majority of autoantigens. These proteome-scale arrays were used to screen for cancer-specific autoantibodies in patient serum samples. Patient samples were initially screened as pools (n=5) followed by screening of individual patient samples.Initial screening was done using samples from patients with breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, colon, kidney, melanoma, and pancreatic cancers. Control samples included samples from normal patients as well as those with benign breast disease, bronchial dysplasia, benign ovarian disease, and benign prostate hyperplasia. Samples from patients with breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancers were sub-divided into additional groups based on clinical findings. In total we screened 22 different groups of patients.We validated this approach with the recovery of well-established tumor antigen p53 and additional antigens. Ovarian cancer yielded the highest percentage of positive autoantibody responses with 21% for p53, 8% for DEK, and 6% for GMPR2. Further evaluation of this approach using sets of molecularly classified patient samples may improve the discovery of diagnostic autoantigens in cancer, especially in combination with patient-specific protein arrays determined from tumor whole-genome sequencing data.']",

        "Background":"[\"Over two million new cases of UV-induced non-melanoma skin cancer are diagnosed yearly in the USA, making it the most common form of cancer in this country. Apigenin, a nonmutagenic, naturally occurring flavonoid found in a variety of fruits and leafy vegetables, inhibits UV-induced skin cancer in mice. Our laboratory and others have shown that apigenin treatment of cells results in a wide variety of antitumorigenic and chemopreventive actions, including suppression of COX-2 expression, enhancement of p53 expression, and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, the primary target(s) responsible for apigenin's chemopreventive function remains elusive. For the first time, we have demonstrated that apigenin activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in keratinocytes (mouse and human keratinocyte cell lines, primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and mouse epidermis in vivo). The activation of AMPK resulted in inhibition of mTOR signaling, which relieved the block to the autophagy pathway, further inducing autophagy in human keratinocytes. At early stages of tumorigenesis, autophagy acts as a tumor suppressor by removing damaged organelles, proteins, reducing chromosome instability, and inducing type II programmed cell death. Therefore, pharmacological induction of autophagy provides a new strategy for cancer chemoprevention. We have further demonstrated that UV radiation also induced moderate AMPK activation, suggesting that there is a protective cellular response after UV radiation alone, providing limited protection through modest AMPK activation. More intriguingly, pretreatment of keratinocytes or skin with apigenin prior to UV radiation induced AMPK activation dramatically (both in vitro and in vivo). In addition, UV markedly increased mTOR phosphorylation in SKH-1 mice epidermis, and apigenin completely inhibited UV-mediated mTOR activation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the AMPK/mTOR axis is involved in chemoprevention of UV-induced skin cancer by apigenin, and mechanistically the activation of AMPK further induces autophagy to suppress UV-induced tumorigenesis. Identifying AMPK-mTOR axis as a key target of apigenin and targeting the autophagy pathway for cancer chemoprevention would provide a new target and strategy for the development of better treatment and prevention of skin cancer.\"]",

Good examples of this are EGFR and VEGF. In melanoma, PD-1 interactions involving the immunobiome are therapeutically important. We conducted a study to detect potential mutations that might enhance therapy in colorectal cancer guided by expression of p87, a product of innate immune system Paneth cells. Methods', ' Adnab-9 immunohistochemistry or ELISA was used to define significant p87 Adenoma-associated antigen field effects (FE) in 10 patients with >1cm large high grade dysplastic adenomas (LHiGDA) and 3 with smaller high grade dysplastic adenomas (SHiGDA). We postulated that SHiGDA are not immunologically recognized by host defenses leading to negative outcomes. We used Ion Torrent™ sequencing (ITS) to find mutations in DNA (QiaAmp kit) extracted from 4 normal-appearing colonic segments taken from 1 patient in each group. Novel mutations found on ITS would then be sought using PCR with appropriate primers and subsequent sequencing of the PCR product circulating DNA extracted from available serum samples. These samples were taken from the Large- and SHiGDA groups described above and from 17 patients undergoing colonoscopy for diverse indications.

Most of these patients had a clinical course which may have differed from their group members suggesting an altered immune system milieu.

Since the mutations of BAP1 gene resulted in loss of function of this protein and were associated with poor prognoses of the malignancies, BAP1 is now considered as a tumor-suppressor gene. Recent studies have shown that BAP1 mutations were also observed in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), which is one of the most aggressive carcinoma with poor prognoses. However, only a few studies have investigated the role of BAP1 mutation on biological function of tumor cells and on clinicopathological features of IHCC. PURPOSE', ' The purpose of this study was to elucidate the association of BAP1 and IHCC. METHOD', ' The expression of BAP1 was immunohistochemically analyzed in surgically resected IHCC specimens, and the cases were classified into three groups based on the result of immunostaining concentration; positive or weakly positive or negative. The clinicopathological factors, such as the disease stage of IHCC, curability and overall survival (OS), were compared among the groups. In cell culture analyses, the expression of BAP1 in IHCC cell lines (HuCC-T1 and TFK-1) was down-regulated by Zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and siRNA in vitro. Then, cell-proliferation assay, migration assay, invasion assay, and drug-susceptibility test were performed on BAP1 down-regulated cells. RESULTS', ' The immunohistochemistry of BAP1 on IHCC specimens showed that OS was not significantly changed among three groups. However, the cases with lower expression of BAP1 including weakly positive and negative tended to be advanced in disease stage compared with cases with BAP1 positive. Interestingly, in the patients received postoperative gemcitabine, a standard chemo-drug for cholangiocarcinoma, cases with lower expression of BAP1 showed prolonged survival compared with cases with BAP1 positive. In cell experiments, the knock-down of BAP1 did not affect cell-proliferation of IHCC cells, however, it promoted migration and invasion of IHCC cells. Furthermore, the suppression of BAP1 enhanced chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS', ' Our study suggested that lower expression of BAP1 was associates with the progression of IHCC and with enhanced chemosensitivity to gemcitabine.

A key component of the cancer paradigm involves cancer stem cells (CSCs), the primary mediators of cancer progression, resistance to therapy and recurrence of cancer after remission/latency. Although the clinical significance of CSCs is well accepted, the key upstream regulatory mechanisms that define these unique subsets of cancer cells requires further clarification. Previous studies demonstrate that MDA-9/Syntenin or syndecan binding protein (SDCBP) levels are elevated in large spectrum of tumors, including melanoma, breast carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), versus normal cellular counterparts. We now uncover a unique function of MDA-9 as a facilitator of cancer stemness and survival.Expression profiles of mda-9, Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-myc were studied in different clinical samples and cell lines for correlations. Cells were sorted by FACS into stem and non-stem populations and the same genes were assayed for correlative expression. Stemness gene expression array profile analysis was performed on control and mda-9 silenced CSCs. Genetic (gain-of-function, loss-of-function) approaches were used to modify mda-9 expression in normal human astrocytes and prostate cells, non-stem cancer cells (NSCCs) and CSCs from breast prostate and GBM. Recovery-of-function approaches were also applied to elucidate the pathways responsible for MDA-9-mediated regulation of CSCs. The impact of MDA-9 on CSC-mediated tumorigenicity and progression was evaluated in vivo by intracranial glioma and subcutaneous xenograft mice models. Apoptosis was assayed by caspase activation and Annexin V staining.A positive and statistically significant correlation was observed between mda-9 and stemness regulating genes (Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-myc), in 50 clinical samples and 3 cell culture systems, including breast, prostate and GBM. CSCs expressed elevated levels of mda-9 vs. non-stem cancer cells or normal stem cells from a total of 11 cell lines including breast, prostate and GBM and two clinical GBM samples. Over-expression of mda-9 in NSCCs increased populations of CSCs as well as expression of stemness regulating genes. Loss of MDA-9 affected 84 genes linked to CSC regulation. Control intracranial glioma xenograft mouse models had large tumors with spongioblastic morphology typical of human gliomas, whereas the loss of mda-9 caused a large decrease in tumor size. Mechanistically, MDA-9 regulated multiple stemness genes and knockdown of MDA-9 caused a loss of stemness and tumorigenicity with initiation of apoptosis.Our data uncover a previously unidentified relationship between MDA-9 and CSCs. CSCs appear more dependent on MDA-9 expression than normal stem cells. MDA-9 regulates CSCs on multiple levels of stemness and survival, reinforcing the relevance of this gene as a potential therapeutic target.']",

PTEN loss of function results in activation of Akt and downstream signaling pathways, and has been associated with numerous cancers, most commonly endometrial cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma and prostate cancer. PTEN loss can be a result of multiple different aberrations which include mutations in the coding region leading to frame-shift or stop codons, genomic deletions as well as promoter methylation leading to loss of PTEN protein. Determination of PTEN status, both at the DNA and protein levels, may be important for clinical decision-making because loss of PTEN is associated with resistance to various targeted therapies, while inactivating mutations may confer sensitivity to therapeutics targeting PI3K pathway members. We have developed Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) assays to assess PTEN mutation status in a set of FFPE patient specimens.Methods', ' Our Sanger sequencing assay for PTEN was developed to detect known hotspot mutations in exons 5-8, which occur in the majority of PTEN mutations reported in the COSMIC database.

These 2 specimens were further analyzed by CISH to determine copy number. Of the 13 specimens reported as mutant by sequencing, IHC protein expression results indicated that 6 were PTEN positive and 7 were PTEN negative, underscoring the observation that exon 5-8 mutation status alone is not sufficient to predict PTEN expression levels. Data on CISH analysis of the specimen that was hemizygous mutant by sequencing will be reported to confirm the copy loss.Conclusion', ' The data suggest that additional mutations outside the exon 5-8 region as well as promoter methylation may result in loss of PTEN protein, and that accurate clinical assessment of PTEN mutation and protein expression status in FFPE tissues requires complimentary methods including Sanger sequencing, IHC and CISH methodologies.']",

        "Background":"[\"Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the United States with the number of incidences persistently rising due to the depletion of the ozone layer and lack of adequate solar protection. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), composed of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), encompasses the vast majority of skin cancers with over 2 million new cases each year. Silibinin, an active bioflavanone was previously shown to have major protective effect against ultraviolet B radiation (UVB)-induced SCC through promoting DNA damage repair as well as inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis. To date, however, the efficacy of silibinin has not been tested against BCC, which alone accounts for about 80% of NMSC incidences. BCC mostly causes disfigurement, pain and morbidity, and warrants greater attention for its prevention and treatment. The hallmark of BCC has been the constitutive activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, mostly through the loss of function mutations in the patched (PTCH) gene. In the present study, we utilized ASZ001 cell line, derived from a mouse BCC tumor induced by UV-radiation in a PTCH1 heterozygous mouse, to evaluate the anti-cancer efficacy of silibinin against BCC. ASZ001 cells lack both copies of the PTCH1 gene and closely resembles the PTCH1 status in human BCC. We treated ASZ001 cells with either DMSO (control) or various doses of silibinin (25-100 M), and performed trypan blue exclusion, clonogenic, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution assays. Results showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) decreases the total cell number by 38-51% (p<0.001), 67-84% (p<0.001) and 40-95% (p<0.05-p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment. Clonogenic assay further confirmed the decrease in cell viability by silibinin, and we observed 18% (p<0.05), 92% (p<0.001) and 100% (p<0.001) decrease in colony formation with 25, 50 and 100 M doses of silibinin, respectively, in ASZ001 cells. Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) also increased the cell death by 2 folds (p<0.05), 3 folds (p<0.001), and 4 folds (p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment while annexin/PI staining confirmed that silibinin-induced cell death in ASZ001 cells is mainly apoptotic in nature. FACS analyses revealed that silibinin treatment significantly modulated the cell cycle distribution in ASZ001 cells, and we observed an S-phase arrest at 50 M silibinin dose and a G2M arrest at 100 M silibinin dose after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Molecular studies showed that silibinin treatment strongly decreases the expression of hedgehog signaling transcriptional factor Gli1, which is typically overexpressed in BCC and is known to regulate the expression of several oncogenes. Together, these results provide the first evidence of silibinin's efficacy against BCC cells, and suggest that silibinin could be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of both types of NMSCs.\"]",

PK analysis of E demonstrated dose proportional increases in Cmax (mean 91.9 ng/ml at DL4) and AUC0-INF (mean 680.4 hr*ng/ml at DL4). Two objective responses were seen (CR, metastatic pulmonary carcinoid; PR, metastatic sinus carcinoma). Prolonged SD  6 cycles occurred in 2 pulmonary carcinoid subjects, and in oropharyngeal SCC, basal cell carcinoma, and esthesioneuroblastoma (n=1 each). In Part B, pretreatment and on-treatment biopsies (Day 20) obtained in the oropharynx SCC subject showed no significant changes in expression of p-AKT, p21, or p53 as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions', ' The phase II recommended dose is E 10 mg/day (days 1 - 21) + C 20 mg/m2 (days 1, 8, and 15) on a 28-day cycle. PK data demonstrate dose-proportional increases in exposure, as previously described for E monotherapy. Antitumor activity was observed in several tumor types, including metastatic sinus carcinoma that had been previously treated with C.']",

        "Background":"['Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant central nervous system neoplasm that primarily affects very young children and has a very poor prognosis. Aside from presumed founder loss of function mutations in the SMARCB1 (BAF47/INI1/SNF5) chromatin remodeling gene, little is known of molecular drivers of AT/RT. LIN28A and LIN28B are stem cell factors that regulate thousands of RNAs and are expressed in aggressive cancers. One of the canonical downstream targets of LIN28 is the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Due to the increased stem cell factor expression in AT/RT, we hypothesized that LIN28 contributes to tumorigenesis in these neoplasms through the regulation of multiple pro-growth, stemness, and metabolic pathways. We identified increased levels of LIN28A in AT/RT primary tumors compared to normal brain using immunohistochemistry (P = 0.026 by Mann-Whitney test). We detected LIN28A or LIN28B in 100% of AT/RT cell lines by western blot or qPCR. Knockdown of LIN28A by lentiviral shRNA in the AT/RT cell lines CHLA-06-ATRT and BT37 inhibited growth, cell proliferation and colony formation and induced apoptosis. Colonies formed by BT37 and CHLA-06 cells with LIN28A knockdown were reduced by between 50 and 90 percent (BT37 p = 0.0002 sh800 vs pLKO, CHLA-06 p = 0.009 sh802 vs pLKO). A Cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) assay for apoptosis showed that LIN28A knockdown in BT37 and CHLA-06 cells led to a 4 to 6 fold increase in the percentage of cells expressing CC3 compared to controls measured by immunofluorescence (BT37 p = 0.0005 sh800 vs pLKO; CHLA-06 p = 0.004 sh802 vs pLKO). Suppression of LIN28A in orthotopic xenograft models led to a more than doubling of median survival compared to empty vector controls (48 vs 115 days - p = 0.007 by Log-rank test) showing that LIN28A is critical to AT/RT cell line tumorigenesis. We found lower KRAS expression in LIN28A knockdown cell lines compared to pLKO control using qPCR. We also found high expression levels of phospho-ERK in AT/RT primary tumors by immunohistochemistry. Increased ERK signaling correlated with LIN28A expression in AT/RT (P = 0.008, r = 0.57 by Spearman correlation). Trametinib is a MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor that has been developed through phase III clinical trials in adult melanoma. Trametinib inhibited the KRAS pathway in CHLA-06-ATRT and BT37 AT/RT cell lines as measured by suppression of p-ERK by Western blot. Treatment with Trametinib for 5 days suppressed the growth of BT37 and CHLA-06 cells (MTS assay for BT37 p = 0.003 for 1 nM and p = 0.002 for 10 nM vs DMSO control; for CHLA-06 p<0.001 for 1 nM and 10nM vs DMSO control by t-test). These data implicate LIN28/RAS/MAP kinase as key drivers of AT/RT tumorigenesis and indicate that targeting this pathway may serve as a novel therapeutic option in this aggressive pediatric malignancy.']",
