        "Background":"['Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome caused by a mutation in or deletion of the NF1 gene. Mutations in the NF1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of neurofibromin that cannot regulate cell growth and division. As a result, tumors such as neurofibromas can form along nerves throughout the body. The NF1 phenotype is highly penetrant and occurs in 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 people worldwide. Individuals with an altered NF1 gene are at an increased risk of developing benign and/or malignant tumors.  NF1 has been shown to negatively regulate Ras activity. Ras-driven cancer cells have also been known to alter glucose and glutamine metabolism. In the present study, we evaluated the role played by NF1 status in determining the sensitivity of sarcoma and melanoma cell lines to glutaminase inhibition and its effect on Ras activity. We tested a panel of soft tissue sarcoma and melanoma cell lines that were either wild-type, null or mutant for NF1. Results from our in vitro proliferation assay showed that compared to wild-type NF1 (STS26T, LS141) cell lines, NF1 mutant (MPNST) and NF1 null (ST88 and MeWo) cell lines showed greater sensitivity to inhibition of proliferation by glutaminase inhibitors CB-839 and BPTES. Western blot analysis showed induction of apoptosis and down regulation of mTORC1 targets such as phospho-S6K and phospho-S6 by glutaminase inhibitors only in NF1 null and NF1 mutant but not wild-type NF1 cell lines. Gene silencing experiments showed that siRNA mediated knockdown of NF1 sensitizes LS141and STS26T cell lines to glutaminase inhibition. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type NF1 GRD (GAP related domain) in MeWo cell line resulted in decreased sensitivity to glutaminase inhibition when tested in a cell proliferation assay, thus, confirming the role played by NF1. Previous reports have shown that mutation or deletion of NF1 results in activation of Ras. In order to test the effect of glutaminase inhibition on Ras activity, we carried out Ras-GTP pull down assay following the treatment with glutaminase inhibitors in NF1 null and wild-type NF1 cell lines. Our results showed that glutaminase inhibition leads to down regulation of activated RAS in NF1 null but not wild-type NF1 cells. SiRNA mediated knockdown of NF1 followed by glutaminase inhibition in wild-type NF1 cell line (LS141) resulted in decreased Ras activity, further confirming our hypothesis. Results from patient derived MPNST tumor xenograft model showed a significant suppression of tumor volume when tumors were treated with glutaminase inhibitor compared to vehicle control. Taken together, our data strongly indicates that NF1 status determines the sensitivity of sarcoma and melanoma cell lines to glutaminase inhibition. Further research is warranted to explore glutaminase inhibition as potential therapy for patients with NF1 loss and/or mutation.']",

        "Background":"['BRAF mutations play a well-established role in melanomagenesis; however, without additional genetic alterations tumor development is restricted by oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Here we show that mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cooperate with BRAF mutations in melanomagenesis by preventing OIS. In a genetically engineered mouse model, Nf1 mutations suppress Braf-induced senescence, promote melanocyte hyperproliferation, and enhance melanoma development. Nf1 mutations function by deregulating both PI3K and ERK pathways. As such, Nf1/Braf mutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors but are sensitive to combined MEK/mTOR inhibition. Importantly, NF1 is mutated or suppressed in human melanomas that harbor concurrent BRAF mutations, NF1 ablation decreases the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from patients following treatment with these agents. Collectively, these studies provide mechanistic insight into how NF1 cooperates with BRAF mutations in melanoma and demonstrate that NF1-inactivation may impact responses to targeted therapies.']",

        "Background":"['We sought to explore the etiology, frequency and clinicopathologic associations of clustered noncoding hotspot mutations in cutaneous malignancies (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)). We did so by applying a sliding window approach which identified clusters in melanoma whole exome and genome sequencing data. These regions were then evaluated for recurrence in other skin malignancies by using whole exome data from BCC and MCC samples; motifs were extracted using a maximum expectation algorithm. We then sequenced 170 annotated melanoma clinical samples using a targeted amplicon panel which permitted analysis of clinicopathological correlations. Numerous recurrent clustered hotspot mutations were identified in melanoma whole exome and genome data sets in proximal promoters, with some gene-associated clusters present in up to 25% of cases. Mutations were clustered around canonical ETS and SP1 transcription factor binding sites and had a clear UV signature. These promoter mutations correlated with overall mutation load and NF1 mutation status, and showed significant enrichment in specific melanoma subtypes (desmoplastic and lentigo maligna melanoma), sun exposed anatomical locations, male gender, ulceration and increasing age. Identical clusters were identified in BCC and MCC samples, including several previously annotated in melanoma. In conclusion, we identify a novel class of mutation in cutaneous malignancies which rather than being defined by a particular genomic position are related to a position in a transcription factor binding motif. These mutations are also independent of cell of origin. Clinicopathologic correlation and mutation analysis support an etiologic role for chronic UV irradiation.']",

        "Background":"['Cutaneous melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer, with ~76,380 newly diagnosed melanoma and ~10,130 melanoma-associated deaths per year in the US. Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and more effective targeted therapies for this devastating disease. The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type. This landmark study highlighted the important role of the previously understudied NF1 tumor suppressor in melanoma pathogenesis, especially for the 9% of melanoma patients who have acquired inactivating NF1-mutations, but lack hotspot mutations that activate BRAF or RAS. To date, animal models have not been developed for the NF1-mutant subtype of melanoma, which has significantly impaired the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this subtype. Here we report the first zebrafish model for NF1-mutant melanoma, which we generated by combining the loss of nf1 with loss of both pten and p53. The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas. Thus our model appears ideal for the testing of drugs that will prove uniquely active for the significant subset of NF1-mutant, BRAF/NRAS-wildtype human melanomas.']",

        "Background":"[\"Despite remarkable therapeutic advances in malignant melanoma, an incomplete understanding of melanoma's extraordinary genetic diversity, complex disease course and ability to resist treatment continues to impede rational, curative clinical intervention. This is particularly true for the understudied dark matter of the melanoma genome, i.e. cases that lack mutations in the three most commonly-mutated melanoma genes (BRAF, NRAS, NF1) and that display extensive mutational heterogeneity. Clearly a pressing need exists for transformative approaches to melanoma medicine. We have therefore broadened our traditional focus on melanoma in human patients to include canine melanoma as a model of human disease. Given canine melanoma's clinicopathological resemblance to human non-cutaneous triple-negative subtypes, study of this disease in each species may inform the other. Further, the accelerated clinical course of canine melanoma and flexibility in veterinary clinical trial design may allow for evaluation of novel treatment designs that would not be possible in human cancer trials. Thus, we have undertaken a first-in-dog genomic characterization study of canine melanomas from a cohort of 37 dogs to further explore the landscape of this comparative model. This analysis combines comprehensive genomics (whole genome, whole genome long-insert, RNA sequencing, and array comparative genomic hybridization) in 7 matched canine melanoma/normal tissues with targeted analysis in an additional 27 tumors and 3 cell lines. These canine tumors display striking patterns of mutation and subtype heterogeneity resembling that of their non-cutaneous human counterparts with the majority being BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 wild type and lacking recurrent single nucleotide variants. Despite heterogeneity at the single nucleotide level, shared patterns of structural variation and gene expression exist and these patterns suggest core pathways that may define therapeutic vulnerabilities in these disease subtypes. These data provide the genomic framework for further clinical pursuit of melanoma in the canine model as a paradigm for drug development.\"]",

        "Background":"['The Ras family of small GTP binding proteins are frequently activated by mutations in melanoma, as shown for NRAS (20%), KRAS (2%) and HRAS (1%). Ras isoforms can also be activated by inactivation of Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs), such as NF1, RASA1, and RASA2. In our recent study, we observed that inactivation of RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1, also called p120RasGAP) suppressed melanoma via its RasGAP activity toward the R-Ras (related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog) isoform and that R-Ras was required to promote anchorage-independent growth driven by RASA1 inactivation. Moreover, a low level of RASA1 mRNA expression is associated with decreased overall survival in melanoma patients with BRAF mutations. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that, although not mutated, R-Ras is activated in melanoma by inactivation of RasGAPs and that BRAF activation cooperates with this RasGAP/R-Ras pathway activation in melanoma tumorigenesis. In this study, we addressed the importance of R-Ras, a previously less appreciated member of the Ras small GTPases family, in melanoma tumorigenesis. We observed frequent activation of R-Ras in BRAF mutant human melanoma cell lines. In addition, RNAi-mediated reduced expression of R-Ras suppressed anchorage-independent colony growth and tumor growth. Moreover, among the 3 major RAS effector pathways, reduced R-Ras expression suppressed Ral-A activation, which may explain the mechanism of Ral-A activation in BRAF mutant melanoma. Interestingly, anchorage-independent growth driven by R-Ras activation downstream of RASA1 inactivation was suppressed by both genetic (siRNA targeting Ral-A) and pharmacological (Ral inhibitor BQU57) inhibition of Ral-A. To further investigate the impact of RASA1 loss, and thus R-Ras activation, on BRAF mutant melanoma development in vivo, we generated a RASA1L/L; BRAFCA/CA; Tyr-CreERT2 mouse model in which treatment with 4OHT results in expression of constitutively activated mutant BRAF and deletion of RASA1 in melanocytic lineage cells. Preliminary analysis shows hyperpigmentation of the ear, tail, and foot pad in RASA1L/L BRAFCA/CA mice compared to RASA1+/+ BRAFCA/CA littermates. Tumors generated in this animal model will be analyzed to determine the extent of R-Ras and Ral-A activity in vivo.

The SNV load in the WT samples is more variable than the BRAF or NRAS driven melanomas.

        "Background":"['Patients with metastatic V600E mutant melanomas treated with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) frequently develop resistant tumors with aggressive phenotypes. Furthermore, approximately 20-40% of V600E mutant tumors are intrinsically resistant to BRAFi. Suitable models for studying mechanisms of acquired and intrinsic resistance to BRAFi are therefore necessary. In the present study, we applied deep sequencing techniques to identify possible mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance in our collection of melanoma patient-derived xenograft models (MEXFs) treated with BRAFi.Mutational and expression profiles in MEXFs were characterized by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix chips and correlated with BRAFi efficacy data from 3D Tumor Clonogenic Assays (TCA). In addition, four resistant cell lines were created by continuously treating 2D monolayer cultures of tumor cells with Vemurafenib, all of which were initially sensitive to BRAFi and carry the BRAF V600E mutation. Expression profiles and mutations of these cell lines were analyzed from RNA-seq data. Potential gene candidates responsible for conferring resistance were further investigated by Q-PCR and Western-blot experiments.WES data revealed that the number of mutations per model was highly variable. Some MEXFs showed a hyper-mutated profile (>2000 mutations) and were characterized by specific mutational signatures in agreement with those found in melanoma (Alexandrov et al, Nature, 2013). Mutation frequencies of genes typically mutated in melanoma are very similar to those found in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We observed a high correlation of mutations between our MEXFs and their respective cell lines. Among the models with a V600E mutation, only one (MEXF 462) showed resistance to BRAFi-treatment as identified by 3D TCA analyses. In this model, we identified gene point mutations and a high over-expression of EGFR, MEK1, PDGFRA and NF1 in contrast to the other models, suggesting a specific regulation of the RTK signaling pathways. In 2D assays, synergistic interaction of Vemurafenib and Erlotinib was shown. RNA-seq analysis of the cell line established from MEXF 276, in which resistance to Vemurafenib was induced, revealed around 20% of genes being differentially expressed (FC>2) between sensitive and resistant cell lines.

Targeted drugs usually induce rapid tumor death leading to the release of neoantigens, and can affect immune development pathways, which could increase the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Assessment of somatic mutation profiles from large public databases provides an estimate of the prevalence of targetable somatic mutations and the burden of somatic nonsynonymous mutations (NsM), used as a surrogate for overall neoantigen load, which, in turn, correlates with clinical utility of checkpoint inhibitors for melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. The rational design of these combinations based on somatic genomic profiles offers a prioritization scheme for new clinical trials. Methods', ' We surveyed 13,349 genomic profiles from public databases for cases with specific mutations targeted by current agents and/or a burden of exome-wide non-synonymous mutations (NsM) that exceeds a recently suggested threshold for response to checkpoint inhibitors. Results', ' Overall, 8.9% of cases have profiles that could benefit from combination therapy, which corresponds to approximately 11.2% of US annual incident cancer cases; the most commonly targetable mutations were observed in PIK3CA, BRAF, NF1, NRAS, and PTEN genes. Interestingly, cases with mutations in SMO, DDR2, FGFR1, PTCH1, FGFR2, and/or MET appear to be enriched in those with high burdens of NsM, who have a higher likelihood of responding to immunotherapy. Of the 13,349 cases that could benefit from combination therapy, 50.9% had BRAF, NF1, GNAQ and/or GNA11 mutations which can be targeted by Trametinib; 26.1% by Taselisib (targets PIK3CA mutations); and 19.8% by Afatinib (EGFR and ERBB2 mutations).

So far, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES) has been implemented in both research and clinical settings to identify oncogenic events in cancer genomes. However, a large number of passenger mutations have been identified and true driver mutations have been disguised. Distinguishing driver events from passenger events will be a key challenge for the realization of targeted therapy. To elucidate driver mutations that are clinically actionable, the Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy at MD Anderson cancer center has developed a NGS clinical sequencing platform, T200, to sequence 202 cancer-related genes at high depth in thousands of cancer patients at MD Anderson.Materials and MethodsThe T200 mutation data, including single nucleotide variants (SNV, variant allele frequency >=1%) and copy number variations (CNV), of more than 500 cancer patients treated in MD Anderson Cancer Center were utilized in our study.Results1. By analyzing the SNV data, we identified several sets of co-occurring genes across all cancers. Some sets such as KRAS/APC/SMAD4 contain driver genes from multiple signaling pathways, which may indicate essential mechanisms for tumor development and nominate targets for combinational therapy.2. We elucidated mutual-exclusive mutations that were from genes in the same or different pathways. Several sets of well-known mutual-exclusive SNVs were verified in our analysis such as BRAF/NRAS SNVs in melanoma. We also illustrated novel sets of mutual-exclusive mutational events, such as IDH1/PTEN/PPP1R3A SNVs in brain tumors and EGFR/FGFR3/GNAS/NOTCH4 CNVs in all cancers.3. SNVs of more than 10 genes were enriched in specific cancer types, such as IDH1 and NF1 in brain tumor, BRAF and MITF in melanoma. CNVs of more than 50 genes were found enriched in one cancer type, such as PDGFRA amplifications in brain tumors and IL6R amplifications in breast cancer. We observed not only expected cancer specific mutations such as BRAF SNVs but also novel mutations such as NF1 SNVs and PDGFRA amplifications.4. We performed mutual-exclusivity and cancer type enrichment analysis on SNV hotspots. More than 20 SNV hotspots were elucidated, such as BRAF(V600E) in melanoma, IDH1(R132H) in brain tumors, KRAS(G12D) in colorectal cancer, and PIK3CA(H1047L) in breast cancer. In addition, multiple SNV hotspots were found to occur mutual-exclusively, such as BRAF(V600E)/IDH1(R132H)/MPL(L532V) in brain tumors.ConclusionDeep target sequencing enables us to systematically determine the potential driver mutation events (including low allele frequency SNVs), which not only help us characterize the landscape of cancer genomic alterations, but also provide comprehensive patient molecular profile to facilitate clinical decision-making and novel clinical trial design.']",

However, a substantial subset of solid tumors does not express these markers, exemplified by the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer. Shared molecular factors that promote the progression of these tumors, and that represent a target for their therapy, are missing. We previously described a role for PHIP (Pleckstrin Homology domain-Interacting Protein) in the progression of melanoma, and demonstrated PHIP activation in triple-negative melanomas. Analysis of the TCGA profiling efforts in melanoma, breast and lung cancer revealed PHIP expression to be enriched in triple-negative breast cancer and in the bronchiad subtype of triple-negative lung cancer. Here we show the broad-based role of PHIP in the progression of triple-negative subtypes of three solid tumors (breast and lung cancer, and melanoma) defined by different mutational drivers and targeted therapies. By using a shRNA-based targeting of PHIP in in vitro and in vivo models, we have suppressed the malignant phenotype of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 human breast carcinoma cells. In addition, PHIP knockdown resulted in significant anti tumor effects in H1703 and Calu3 human lung cancer cells lacking mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and ALK, and in two short-term triple wild type melanoma cultures lacking mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and NF1. Suppression of PHIP expression resulted in inhibition of both tumor cell proliferation by cell survival and colony formation assays and invasion into matrigel in each of the tumor models examined, and was accompanied by suppression of pAKT, CCND1, TLN1, and ITGβ1 expression when assessed by western-blot or quantitative immunofluorescence. The PHIP protein contains two bromodomains that can be therapeutically targeted by small molecules. However, the functional activity of the PHIP bromodomains has been poorly characterized. We show that PHIP co-localizes with and binds to the acetylated histone modification H4K91ac, and that both are coordinately regulated upon growth factor stimulation suggesting a new function for PHIP as a chromatin remodeler. To conclude, our results identify a novel role for PHIP in the progression of solid tumors lacking the major molecular drivers, and suggest PHIP as a druggable target for the therapy of these malignancies.']",

        "Background":"[\"Mutant BRAF gene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth through overactivation of RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway. BRAF V600E mutation occurs in approximately 40% to 50% of melanomas. Although BRAF inhibitors have been used to successfully treat melanomas containing the BRAF V600E mutation, patients often become resistant to BRAF inhibitors within a few months. A number of studies have indicated that secondary mutations such as NRAS or NF1 are significantly associated with BRAF resistance by sequencing patient samples. However, due to the genetic heterogeneity commonly observed in tumors, it is unclear if those secondary mutations already existed within low percentage subclones or if they were acquired through drug treatment. It's yet to be determined whether such genetic variants are only associated with resistance, or they actually cause the resistance. In this study, we used genome editing CRISPR technology to generate a drug resistant mutation NRAS Q61K within A375 melanoma cell line which naturally contains BRAFV600E. When compared to the parental line, this isogenic cell model demonstrated that genetically modified NRAS gene at the endogenous level directly leads to a significant resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Method and results\", ' Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed and built to guide Cas9 to bind and cut desired regions in the NRAS gene target. Melanoma cell line A375 was co-transfected with the single guide and CRIPSR all-in-one plasmid alongside donor plasmid. Transfected cells were sorted into single cells and expanded for subsequent screening of desired gene mutation events. The introduction of NRAS Q61K mutation in the cells was then confirmed via Sanger sequencing and NGS at the genetic level and transcriptional level. Drug responses to BRAF specific inhibitors and non-specific chemotherapy drugs were compared between A375 NRAS Q61K isogenic cell line and parental cell line in 2D and 3D culture environment. Testing results demonstrated that the isogenic cell line created by CRISPR showed significant resistance to BRAF inhibitor in comparison to the parental control in both 2D and 3D culture environment. In summary, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing platform to target endogenous loci in human cells and create the intended genetic mutation event. This new approach provides direct bio-functional evidence of acquiring a drug resistant gene drives tumor cells survival under targeted therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, unlike conventional drug resistant cell models that have been developed through drug selection, the A375 NRAS Q61K isogenic cell line represents a new type of drug resistant model that contains a defined genetic resistance mechanism. It reserves the permanent and genetically stable resistance characteristics without being maintained in drug selection culture environment. Therefore, it provides a valuable tool for developing next generation therapeutics that can overcome BRAF drug resistant in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['The RAS/RAF/MEK pathway is a major driver of malignant progression, particularly in cancers arising from mutations in RAS, BRAF and NF1. Although both BRAF and MEK inhibitors have been approved for treatment of melanoma, their clinical activity is commonly limited by acquired resistance due to reactivation of the pathway downstream of their targets. Since the ERK1/2 kinases are the final node in the MAPK signaling pathway, they are not subject to the feedback reactivation mechanisms that can undermine RAF or MEK blockade, offering the possibility of clinical benefit in settings where earlier drugs are ineffective. Here we describe the characterization of KO-947, a potent and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 kinases, in biochemical, cellular and in vivo antitumor activity assays. KO-947 was profiled in vitro in biochemical activity assays, competition binding assays, and a probe-based competition binding assay in cell lysates, and subsequently screened in a large panel of human tumor cell lines focused on MAPK-dysregulated tumor types. In vivo studies were carried out in well-characterized xenograft models of BRAF-, KRAS- and NRAS-mutant disease and subsequently extended to a large panel of early-passage patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representative of a wide range of tumor types and molecular profiles. Biochemical assays reveal that KO-947 is a 10nM inhibitor of ERK with at least 50-fold selectivity against a panel of 450 kinases. KO-947 blocks ERK signaling and proliferation of tumor cells exhibiting dysregulation of MAPK pathway signaling, including mutations in BRAF, NRAS or KRAS, at low nanomolar concentrations. KO-947 is differentiated from other published ERK inhibitors by an extended residence time and high potency in cell engagement that translate into prolonged pathway inhibition in vitro and in vivo. In cell-line derived xenograft studies, the drug profoundly suppresses ERK signaling for up to five days after a single dose and induces regressions in RAS- and RAF-mutant melanoma, NSCLC and pancreatic cancer models on administration schedules ranging from daily to weekly. Intermittent dosing enables comparable antitumor activity at reduced dose-intensity. PDX screening confirms and extends these findings to include RAS and BRAF mutant colorectal, gastric and cervical carcinoma models, and robust activity is also seen on both weekly and Q2D schedules in tumor models lacking BRAF/RAS mutations but with other dysregulation of the MAPK pathway. Thus, the favorable ADME properties of KO-947 enable the achievement of optimal antitumor activity with intermittent dosing, which may provide an opportunity to maximize the therapeutic window with flexible administration routes and schedules. These results demonstrate the potential clinical utility of KO-947 in MAPK pathway dysregulated tumors.']",

Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples. In future experiments we plan to test clinical samples from patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and we hypothesize that HGF, NRG1, and FGF2 signaling is elevated in patients with poor initial responses or relapse to BRAF or MEK inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' The knowledge of actionable somatic genomic alterations present in human tumors is enabling the new era of personalized cancer treatment. The great intellectual challenge lies in linking confirmed mutations to protein function. Personalized tumor graft models (Avatars) can aid in the process of genomic analyses interpretation to ultimately move from molecular profile to medication. Methods', ' Using massive parallel sequencing we performed whole exome sequencing analysis of tumor and matched normal blood samples of 23 patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors (7 lung cancer, 7 pancreatic cancer, 1 neuroendocrine tumor, 2 glioblastoma, 1 uveal melanoma, 2 melanomas and 3 colon cancer) to identify putatively actionable tumor-specific genomic alterations. Avatar models generated by direct engraftment of tumor samples from the pts into immunocompromised mice were used as an in vivo platform to test proposed treatment strategies. Results', ' Successful exome sequencing analyses has been obtained for 21 pts (1 patient died prematurely, 1 sample was insufficient). Tumor specific mutations (Muts) and copy number variations were identified ranging from 5 to 952 and 0 to 36 respectively. All samples profiled contained clinically meaningful genomic alterations. A successful Avatar model was generated for 10 out of 17 pts. Two engraftment failures corresponded to EGFR mutant lung tumors resected while pts were receiving erlotinib, which initially grew but then regressed. Some of the most relevant drugabble alterations were', ' KRAS, CHEK1, FGFR2, IGF1R, MET, BRCA1, XPC, NOTCH, CREB3LB, GNA11, SMAD4 and EGFR. In occasions druggable alterations such as muts in NF1, PTPRC, PI3KA and DDR2 failed to provide any benefit when a targeted drug was tested in the Avatar and accordingly treatment of the pts with these drugs was not effective. In one case, loss of STK11 lead to testing of mTOR and SRC inhibitors resulting in tumor regression both in the Avatar and in the clinic. At present time 10 pts have received a personalized treatment', ' 2 pts, as expected based on the Avatar model, did not response; 4 pts resulted in durable partial remissions and 4 pts are currently on treatment with disease stabilization. In one of the EGFR mutant lung pts the genomic analysis revealed traces of an acquired mutation and allowed decision making at an earlier time point, prior to relapse. Overall, there was a remarkable correlation between drug activity in the Avatar and clinical outcome in the pts, in terms of drug resistance and sensitivity. Conclusion', ' The detection of actionable tumor-specific genomic alterations in the clinical setting is feasible. However predicting treatment response to known oncogenes is complex and requires detailed information of how different genetic backgrounds function. Avatar models are a powerful investigational platform for therapeutic decision making and help to guide cancer treatment in the clinic.']",

TML is proposed as a potential predictive biomarker due to its association with tumor immunogenicity. Methods', ' TML was assessed in 8020 tumors from 14 different cancers using somatic nonsynonymous missense mutations sequenced with a 592-gene panel. High TML was set at  17 mutations per megabase (mt/MB) based on an established concordance ( > 99%) with MSI-High in colorectal cancer (CRC). Results', ' Mean TML was highest in melanoma (Mel; 21 mt/MB), NSCLC (11 mt/MB), and bladder cancer (BLC; 11 mt/MB), whereas prostate cancer (PC), pancreas adenocarcinoma (PA), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) had the lowest levels (all 6 mt/MB). High TML was seen most frequently in Mel (36%), NSCLC (15%), BLC (15%), and anal cancer (SCCA; 9%); and least frequently in PA (1.6%) and RCC (0.5%). Primary NSCLC carried lower TML than its brain metastases (11 vs. 16 mt/MB, p < 0.001). Older age was associated with higher TML in Mel (p = 0.001), CRC (p = 0.009), breast cancer (BC; p = 0.01), and NSCLC (p = 0.02). Higher TML was seen in males than in females for Mel (p = 0.002) and NSCLC (p < 0.001). Presence of mutations in oncogenic driver genes such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1 RET fusions, cMET exon 14 skipping correlated with lower TML in NSCLC (6.9 vs. 12 mt/MB, p < 0.001), as did BRAF and NRAS mutations in Mel (17 vs. 26, p = 0.003). Conversely, mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as ARID1A (CRC, NSCLC, and BLC) and NF1 (BC, CRC, Mel, BLC, and NSCLC) were associated with higher TML (p < 0.05). MSI-high was correlated with high TML in CRC and gastric cancers (p < 0.05). Conclusions', ' TML varied significantly among different cancers. High TML was associated with older age, absence of oncogenic mutations and presence of tumor suppressor gene mutations.

        "Background":"['Histiocytic Sarcomas (HS) are rare neoplasms derived from hematopoietic or mesenchymal stem cells and are known to have a poor prognosis. Primary lesions of HS appear in the spleen, lymph nodes, lung, bone marrow, skin and hypodermis. The definitive cell of origin, genetic etiology, and critical drug targets for HS therapy are unknown. To address all three questions we have utilized a forward genetic screening method in mice that can identify mutations capable of causing cancer initiation and progression. The forward genetic screen uses the Sleeping Beauty (SB) DNA transposon as a random somatic mutagen, capable of both activating proto-oncogenes and inactivating tumor suppressor genes. The system relies on the use of a Cre/LoxP-regulated SB transposase transgene and mutagenic transposon vector transgenes that are mobilized by the transposase. Using Cre recombinase under the control of a tissue specific promoter allows for selective, tissue specific mutagenesis in particular cells of interest. Tumors generated in these mice are analyzed for recurrent transposon insertion sites (called common insertion sites or CIS) using ligation-mediated PCR in combination with high-throughput sequencing. As in human cancer, our results often reveal a small number of frequently mutated genes that cooperate with a greater number of rare mutant genes that drive formation of tumors. We hypothesized that SB-mediated transposition of an oncogenic transposon in myeloid lineage cells in mice could cause mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to the initiation and progression of HS. We generated and aged 190 experimental and control transgenic mice. The triple transgenic, experimental mice express SB transposase in myeloid lineage cells containing an oncogenic transposon by virtue of a Cre recombinase transgene under the control of the Lysozyme M promoter, which is expressed in committed myeloid lineage cells. Remarkably, triple transgenic mice became moribund much faster than controls. Histopathology suggests 30% of the experimental mice developed HS. We have performed immunohistochemistry to confirm the tumor type using antibodies to Mac-2, F4/80 and PAX5. Tumors were analyzed by mapping transposon insertions to the mouse genome from many independently generated tumors. We mapped 1,177 non-redundant insertions and generated a list of 23 candidate HS genes comprised of known cancer genes as well as novel candidate genes. Our top 3 hits are Raf1 and Fli1, known oncogenes associated with hematological neoplasms, and Mitf, a transcription factor associated with melanoma. Our list also includes known tumor suppressors Trp53 and Nf1. Our results show that 1', ' A mature myeloid lineage cell can serve as a target cell for HS. 2', ' ETS and basic helix-loop-helix (hHLH)-leucine zipper transcription factor networks can induce HS with Raf-activated pathways And 3', ' RAF-MEK-ERK signaling is likely a useful target for HS treatment.']",

When ITs internalize into target cells, they induce protein synthesis inhibition and apoptosis. While ITs are highly specific and potent, the efficacy of IT-based therapies in some tumor cells is limited by hyperactive anti-apoptotic pathways and inefficient translocation of ITs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol. Therefore, to improve the efficacy of IT-based therapies, we evaluated a dual-pathway therapy that combines an IT with the ABT-737, ABT-263, or ABT-199 small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor. Methods', ' The immunotoxin 9.2.27-PE38KDEL (9.2.27-IT) was generated by fusing a truncated mutant form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A to a single-chain variable fragment antibody. It targets human chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), an antigen highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells. We screened and identified 3 human glioblastoma xenografts, 3 human melanoma cell lines, and 5 human breast cancer cell lines resistant to the 9.2.27-IT despite their high levels of cell surface expression of CSPG4 (IC50 of IT alone was >100 ng/ml in all cell lines except for one melanoma cell line). In vitro cytotoxicity of the 9.2.27-IT alone or in combination with the individual Bcl-2 inhibitors ABT-737, ABT-263, or ABT199was assessed. Concentrations of ABT analogues were chosen so that ABT alone did not induce cytotoxicity. Results', ' The treatment groups that responded to the combination therapy yielded IC50 values ranging from 0.04  9 ng/ml for glioblastoma xenografts, 0.21-15 ng/ml for melanoma cell lines, and 4.5-50 ng/ml for breast cancer cell lines. The most potent combination group showed >1000 fold improvement of IC50 compared to using the immunotoxin alone. ABT-737 produced the strongest synergistic effects among the ABT analogues. Preliminary results from in vivo studies further demonstrated that this approach engendered a synergistic response and delayed tumor growth in immunotoxin-resistant mouse tumor models.
