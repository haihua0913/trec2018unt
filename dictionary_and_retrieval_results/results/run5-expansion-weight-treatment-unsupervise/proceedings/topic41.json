Translocations involving the NTRK1/2/3 kinase domain, mutations involving the TRK ligand-binding site, and amplifications of NTRK, have been described in diverse tumor types and may contribute to tumorigenesis. A broad range of pediatric malignancies have been found to harbor NTRK fusions, including infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS), spindle-cell sarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, pediatric papillary thyroid cancer, pediatric gliomas and Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Larotrectinib is the first small-molecule selective inhibitor of TRKA, -B, and -C in clinical development and preliminary data from the adult phase 1 trial demonstrate prolonged responses in patients with TRK fusions and a favorable safety profile. Methods', ' We have initiated an open-label, multi-center, international Phase 1/2 study with larotrectinib in pediatric patients with solid tumors and primary CNS tumors (NCT02637687). Patients with advanced cancer between the ages of 1 year and 21 years are eligible, as well as patients as young as 1-month of age with a documented NTRK fusion. Patients with IFS who have not had definitive surgery are also eligible. Larotrectinib is administered orally twice daily on a continuous 28-day schedule. Dosing is based on body surface area. Larotrectinib is available in an oral liquid formulation and capsules. Following identification of the maximum tolerated dose of larotrectinib in the phase 1 portion, the phase 2 portion will commence. The phase 2 portion will enroll patients with NTRK-translocated tumors and measurable disease into three cohorts', ' 1) infantile fibrosarcoma; 2) extracranial solid tumors; and 3) primary CNS tumors. The primary endpoint for the phase 2 portion is objective response rate, with duration of response and progression free survival as secondary efficacy endpoints. Each phase 2 cohort will enroll in a single stage of up to 10 patients per cohort. Molecular abnormalities will be characterized through the analysis of archival tissue. Enrollment began in December 2015 and is ongoing. Clinical trial information', ' NCT02637687']",

        "Background":"['In cancer, the formation of chimeric gene fusions by genomic rearrangement causes aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase activation resulting in sustained oncogenic signaling driving tumorigenesis. Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 1 (NTRK1), the cognate receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), has been reported in 7 tumor types as a NTRK1 kinase domain fused with several reported partners including the 5 coiled-coil domain of the tropomysin TPM3 gene. The resultant NTRK1 fusion protein is present in about 1.5% of colorectal cancer (CRC), 3% of lung and 12% of papillary thyroid cancers. In addition, gene fusions involving NTRK2 and NTRK3 are present in about 19 different tumor types. Thus pharmacologically targeting NTRK kinase in cancers bearing NTRK fusions may provide treatment options to patients who otherwise might be resistant to standard oncolytic regimens. Merestinib (LY2801653) is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of several oncokinases, including MET, AXL, ROS1 and MKNK1/2. Merestinib and its two primary metabolites, M1 (LSN2800870) and M2 (LSN2887652) were shown in scanMaxSM kinase binding assays to inhibit all three NTRKs with an IC50 ranging from 15-320 nM, and in the cell-based PathHunter NTRK1 assay with an IC50 ranging from 12-92 nM. Merestinib, M1 and M2 were evaluated in vitro in TPM3-NTRK1 fusion bearing CRC cells (KM-12). Merestinib, M1 and M2 reduced p-NTRK1 levels, cell proliferation (IC50 of 11 nM, 18 nM and 100 nM respectively) and anchorage independent growth (IC50 of 45 nM, 79 nM and 206 nM respectively). Crizotinib previously reported (Nat Med. 2013;19', '1469-72) to have moderate activity against NTRK1, was used to treat a patient with NTRK1 fusion resulted with transient response. Crizotinib was shown here to also reduce p-NTRK1 levels, cell proliferation (IC50 = 88nM) and anchorage independent growth (IC50 = 276nM) in vitro in KM-12 cells. Merestinib treatment at 24 mg/kg once daily arrested tumor growth (T/C = 4%) in KM-12 xenograft tumor bearing mice. Crizotinib administered at 25 mg/kg twice daily in this same model did not result in tumor growth arrest (T/C = 39.5%). Merestinib treatment at 24 mg/kg once daily led to tumor regression in a CRC PDX xenograft model (EL1989) bearing the TPM3-NTRK1 fusion. Crizotinib treatment at 25 mg/kg twice daily in this model did not show tumor regression. Further pre-clinical studies of Merestinib inhibition of NTRK2 and NTRK3 gene fusion are ongoing. These data support the clinical evaluation of Merestinib in patients with tumors harboring NTRK fusion. Merestinib is currently being studied clinically in advanced cancers (NCT01285037).']",

        "Meeting_name":" RET and integrin crosstalk provides functional plasticity",
        "Background":"['The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. RET becomes activated upon formation of a complex with the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand and GDNF-family receptor (GFRa), which leads to activation of multiple downstream signalling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK, STAT3, and SRC. Constitutive activation of RET, through translocations or missense mutations, leads to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), respectively. Also, RET expression has been detected in pancreatic and breast cancers, and has been linked to increased metastatic potential. In order to clarify the underlying role of RET in tumour progression, we examined the relationship between RET and two integrin subunits, 1 (ITGB1) and 3 (ITGB3). Integrin proteins are important for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and focal adhesion (FA) formation. Functionally, integrins are important for cell-adhesion and migration as they provide traction and leverage for cell movement. Previously, we have shown that RET is able to increase cell-migration and adhesion, and that both ITGB1 and ITGB3 are important for these processes. Here, we show that RET-mediated cell-migration is persistent over 24 hours, and that patterns of cell-adhesion fluctuate over this time, predictably representing different forces needed to move across the microenvironment. Cell-adhesion is increased upon 1 hour of GDNF treatment, but is lost between 3-12 hours of GDNF treatment. Interestingly, we observed that ITGB1 activation downstream of RET, detected by co-immunoprecipitation with paxillin, is transient, and lasts for 1 hour. Conversely, ITGB3 activation downstream of RET, detected using an active heterodimer-specific antibody, is sustained between 1-12 hours of GDNF treatment. These results demonstrate unique functional roles for ITGB1 and ITGB3 downstream of RET. We also examined the importance of signalling pathways downstream of RET for integrin activation, and found that, in a 2D collagen environment, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK are important for RET-mediated FA formation. However, in a 3D collagen environment where cells formed spheroids, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 are important for cell-outgrowth, downstream of RET activation. This likely represents different cellular responses needed to overcome environment-specific obstacles. Finally, we showed evidence for a relationship between RET, ITGB1 and ITGB3 in tumour progression using a cohort of various clinically annotated thyroid cancer samples. Ultimately, we have shown a role for in activation of two integrin subunits, ITGB1 and ITGB3, downstream of RET and how each of these proteins may contribute to metastatic events, particularly those involved in thyroid cancer.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Hras versus Braf activation determines follicular versus papillary thyroid cancer development.",
        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and incidences are rising. MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in playing a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of thyroid cancer, as evidenced by the high incidence of non-overlapping mutations of the genes encoding RET and TRK, as well as of NRAS, HRAS, KRAS and BRAF. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is commonly associated with mutations of the RAS family of oncoproteins, while papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is often associated with mutations in BRAF. To determine whether mode of MAPK activation played a role in thyroid cancer development in mice, we generated HrasG12V and BrafV600E knock-in models. We report that a thyroid specific knock-in of HrasG12V and Pten inactivation leads to the development of FTCs and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTCs) by 47-52 weeks of age in HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre mice. In stark contrast, mice with a thyroid specific knock-in of BrafV600E and loss of Pten (BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre) rapidly develop PDTCs and anaplastic thyroid cancer with complete lethality by weaning, suggesting that Braf and Hras, in cooperation with PI3K signaling, likely play distinct roles in the development and progression of disease. We next sought to dissect the role of Hras versus Braf activation in FTC versus PTC development. We derived stable cell lines from HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre and BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre tumors in order to identify cellular and molecular consequences of Hras versus Braf activation and their potential impact on tumor phenotype. We have found significant differences in phosphorylation of kinases in response to Hras versus Braf activation. Hras activation leads to increased phosphorylation of mTOR effectors, while Braf activation increases CREB activation. Studies are ongoing to identify the molecular mechanism of these observed differences. We have also shown a significant decrease in the growth of HrasG12V/Ptenhom (p=0.0009) and BrafV600E/Ptenhom (p=0.0001) cells treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, suggesting that activated Hras or Braf-even in the context of Pten loss-partially relies on MAPK signaling to reach its full oncogenic potential. We have recently employed a PCR array approach to identify differences in the expression of genes related to the MAPK pathway in HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom cell lines. We noted an up-regulation of Myc, Cdkn1a, and Sfn in BrafV600E/Ptenhom cells in comparison to HrasG12V/Ptenhom cells, which may contribute to the different pathophysiology of HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom tumor sub-types. Because FTCs and PTCs have different responses to therapy, we seek to identify the cellular and physiological consequences of Ras versus Raf activation which will hopefully aid in the discovery of novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for thyroid cancer.']",
