We retrospectively collected clinical characteristics and survival data of the patients, and analyzed EGFR expression on tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of primary tumor tissues by immunochemical staining (IHC). EGFR expression was scored to 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+ based on intensity of reactivity.Results', ' Of total 937 patients, 295 (31.5%) patients, 101 (10.8%) patients and 36 (3.8%) patients showed EGFR 1+, 2+, and 3+ expression by IHC, respectively. EGFR overexpression (2+/3+) is more frequently found in intestinal type than diffuse or mixed type (24.2% vs. 5.1%, P<0.001). In stage III disease according to AJCC 7th edition, unlike other stages, the patients with EGFR overexpression (2+/3+) had longer disease free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.639; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.434-0.938; P=0.022) and longer overall survival (HR, 0.630; 95% CI, 0.445-0.890, P=0.009) than other patients in univariate analysis. Additionally, in 279 patients who had stage III gastric cancer with diffuse type histology and received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based adjuvant chemotherapy, EGFR overexpression was favorable prognostic marker for overall survival (HR, 0.365; 95% CI, 0.161-0.827; P=0.016) in multivariate analysis, while old age and lymphovascular invasion were poor prognostic factors.Conclusion', ' EGFR overexpression was potentially favorable prognostic biomarker for stage III gastric cancer, especially in the patients who received 5-FU based adjuvant chemotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is the most abundant cellular chaperone and has nearly 100 pivotal client proteins, which are commonly dysregulated in cancers. The positive rate of Hsp90beta in gastric cancer (GC) tissue was approximately 30%, and was higher than non-cancerous gastric mucosa. Hsp90 inhibitors should have great potentials in the exploration for treatment strategy in gastric cancer (GC). NYP-AUY922-AG (AUY922), kindly provided by Novartis Pharma AG, is a novel resorcinylic isoxazole amide Hsp90 inhibitor. Using 72-hour MTT colorimetric assay, we have demonstrated that AUY922 has highly active growth inhibitory effects as a single agent of IC50 in the nanomolar ranges between 8.1  0.2 and 14.7  0.8 nM in the gastric cancer cell line panels (except c-met-overexpressing KATO-III cells with a IC50 of 158.1  5.1 nM). In the gastric cancer MKN45 xenograft model, MKN45 cells (2  106) were injected subcutaneously in 100 l of Matrigel/Hanks balanced salt solution to the flank of nude mice. AUY922 50 mg/kgw and 100 mg/kgw intraperitoneal weekly injection (i.p.) were used. Tumor inhibitory effects of AUY922 in the MKN45 human gastric cancer xenograft model were statistically evident in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Several important growth factor receptors are overexpressed in GC, namely EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor, HER1), HER-2/neu, and c-met (hepatocyte growth factor receptor, HGF receptor), etc. By immunohistochemical staining of xenograft tumor tissues using specific antibodies, AUY922 100 mg/kgw i.p. weekly significantly down regulates multiple growth factor receptors and oncoproteins, including c-met, HER-2/neu, IGF1-R, EGFR, Akt, and notably thymidylate synthase (TS), etc. While the effects of AUY922 50 mg/kgw are less statistically significant. Up to date, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or oral fluoropyrimidines are the current mainstay agents for first-line treatment in gastric cancer. By combining AUY922 100 mg/kgw i.p. and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 40 mg/kgw i.p. weekly (wk), tumor inhibitory effects of AUY922 and 5-FU were synergistically effective. Combining AUY922 50 mg/kgw or 100 mg/kgw i.p. weekly and other relevant chemotherapeutic agents has been also actively exploring. Our data indicate that AUY922 plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) inhibits tumors synergistically in gastric cancer MKN45 xenograft via down regulation of multiple pivotal growth factor receptors and oncoproteins. Since phase I study of AUY922 has been completed with favorable toxicity profiles, it is highly reasonable to combine AUY922 with 5-FU or other relevant chemotherapeutic agents in future development of clinical trials for gastric cancers.']",

Methods', ' Two irinotecan-resistant gastric cancer cell lines, OCUM-2M/SN38 and OCUM-8/SN38, were respectively established by stepwise exposure to SN38 from the parent gastric cancer cell lines OCUM-2M and OCUM-8.

Results', ' Gefitinib or lapatinib showed synergistic anti-tumor effects against OCUM-2M/SN38 and OCUM-8/SN38 cells when used in combination with SN38, but not against OCUM-2M or OCUM-8 cells. SN38 increased the expression of EGFR and HER2 in OCUM-2M/SN38 and OCUM-8/SN38 cells. The combination of an EGFR inhibitor and SN38 significantly increased the levels of apoptosis-related molecules, caspase-6, p53, and DAPK-2, and resulted in the induction of apoptosis of irinotecan-resistant cells. The EGFR inhibitors increased the S-phase and decreased the UGT1A1 and ABCG expression in irinotecan-resistant cells. The SN38 plus Lapatinib group more effectively suppressed in vivo tumor growth by OCUM-2M/SN38 cells than either alone group.Conclusion', ' The combination treatment with an EGFR inhibitor and irinotecan might produce synergistic anti-tumor effects for irinotecan-refractory gastric cancer cells.

        "Background":"['Epiregulin (EREG), a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), induces cell growth by binding to the EGFR. Expression of EREG affects sensitivity to cetuximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody that inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway. The mechanism through which EREG is regulated is largely unknown, but a methyl-array study performed by our group revealed that EREG is methylated in gastric cancer cells. In the present study, we found that EREG gene expression was low in seven out of 11 gastric cancer cells and this down-regulation was mediated by aberrant CpG methylation of the EREG promoter. Treatment with 5-aza-CdR restored EREG expression and demethylated the CpG sites in the EREG promoter. Compared to DNMT1, knockdown of DNMT3b significantly increased the expression of EREG mRNA and led to the demethylation of specific CpG sites in the EREG promoter, suggesting that DNMT3b primarily regulates the CpG methylation and silencing of EREG gene. EREG methylation was observed in 30% (4/13) of human primary gastric tumor tissues. In addition to DNA methylation, results from a ChIP assay demonstrated that transcriptional levels of EREG were associated with the enrichment of active histone markers (H3K4me3 and AcH3) and of a repressive marker (H3K27me2). Treatment with 5-aza-CdR dynamically increased the low occupancy of H3K4me3 and AcH3, while decreasing the high enrichment of H3K27me2, indicating that dynamic histone modifications contribute to EREG regulation in addition to DNA methylation. Lastly, the combination of 5-aza-CdR and cetuximab exerted a synergistic anti-proliferative effect on gastric cancer cells. Taken together, the results of our study demonstrated for the first time that EREG is epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer cells by aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of death from cancer globally. Sigma-2 Receptor/Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (S2R/Pgrmc1) is a cytochrome-related protein and it is upregulated in multiple types of cancer. S2R/Pgrmc1 binds to several proteins including epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and regulates the EGFR signaling in lung and breast cancer cells, as we previously showed. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), a member of EGFRs family, has been evaluated as a potential therapeutic target for GC due to an identified link between expression of HER2 and severity of GC. Several HER2 inhibitors are currently under investigation in Phase I and II clinical trials. Most of them inhibit ligand binding or kinase activity of HER2. Here, we suggest that HER2 is a novel molecular target of S2R/Pgrmc1, thus, inhibiting S2R/Pgrmc1 can be a potential therapeutic strategy for GC.Results', ' We found that the protein expression of S2R/Pgrmc1 is elevated in human gastric cancer tissue array and in multiple gastric cancer cell lines such as AGS, NCI-N87, and Hs 746T. Approximately 60% of GC cells have moderate to strong staining of S2R/Pgrmc1 as compared to weak staining noted in normal gastric cells, suggesting an association of S2R/Pgrmc1 with pathogenesis of GC. We also found that S2R/Pgrmc1 was inhibited by AG205, an inhibitor of PGRMC1, in concentration-dependent manner in NCI-N87 GC cell line. Consistently, AG205 inhibited proliferation of NCI-N87 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manner (p-value = 0.025). HER2 is a prognostic marker in GC and overexpression of protein level of HER2 is associated with tumor growth. We found that HER2 expression was decreased in AG205 treated NCI-N87 in concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that AG205 enhanced the sensitivity of Herceptin, an anti-HER2 antibody that inhibits tumor growth. Akt, a downstream target of HER2, is overexpressed in GC, and regulates tumorigenic properties of cancer cells including tumor growth and survival. Here, we demonstrated that concomitant treatment of the GC cells with Herceptin and AG205 significantly decreased Akt protein level as compared to control cells or cell treated with Herceptin alone. Consistently, the viability of the cells was significantly lower in combination treatment group (p-value = 0.009), as compared to groups treated with Herceptin or AG205 alone.Conclusion', ' We have demonstrated that S2R/Pgrmc1 promotes proliferation of GC cell line and regulates the expression of HER2.

        "Background":"['Molecular activating events involving the ERBB RTK family members (EGFR (ERBB1), HER2 (ERBB2), HER3 (ERBB3), HER4 (ERBB4)) drive oncogenesis by inducing proliferation, invasion and survival primarily through RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in several cancers. The clinical successes of HER2 directed therapies are well known in breast cancer and more recently, in gastric cancer. However, resistance develops invariably and gastric cancer continues to be a largely unmet disease necessitating novel therapeutic interventions. Recent reports have highlighted HER3 as an emerging target as it is frequently overexpressed, mutated, preferentially dimerizes with HER2 to activate signaling and is induced as a result of de novo or acquired resistance to PI3K-AKT, MAPK and RTK pathway inhibitors. We explored the utility of an ADCC and CDC enhanced potent anti-HER3 therapeutic antibody (GSK2849330) as a single agent or in combination with a selective small molecule AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of gastric cancer.A panel of 15 HER3 mutant and 4 HER3 wildtype PDX models was screened in vivo for responses to GSK2849330 as measured by% tumor growth inhibition (%TGI). Several models were characterized for other molecular alterations (e.g. HER2, PTEN, HER3, etc.) and represented various subsets of gastric cancer. As a single agent administered at 25mg/kg IP BIW, GSK2849330 was modestly effective (TGI  50%) in 2/15 mutant and 2/4 wildtype models. While context is likely to matter to drive dependence on HER3, no obvious predictive markers were observed. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of combination therapy with an AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) administered at 60mg/kg PO QD in a HER3 wildtype, PTEN deficient model. This resulted in significant durable tumor growth inhibition (94% TGI) with improved survival and noticeable tumor regression in a few mice in the combination treatment group relative to either single agent groups. Tumor samples collected at the end of the study showed pronounced pharmacodynamic modulation of p-AKT and p-HER3, demonstrating on target activity of these agents.Taken together, our findings suggest that modest anti-tumor activity was elicited by GSK2849330 as monotherapy in select gastric PDX models with no clear associations between response and HER3 mutations or other known markers. However, robust durable activity was observed upon combination with GSK2110183. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence supporting the rational combination of a selective AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) and an anti-HER3 therapeutic antibody (GSK2849330), both of which are actively undergoing clinical trials and warrant further investigation in gastric cancer.']",

However, recent clinical studies with EGFR targeting antibodies in GC have failed to show promise (EXPAND and REAL3 trials). Nonetheless, the dismal prognosis associated with late stage disease and the frequent implication of dysregulated HER family signaling in GC necessitate further investigation.AZD8931 is an orally bioavailable, highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 signaling(1).To evaluate the potential utility of this agent in clinical GC, we examined HER family gene amplification and expression in GC tissue samples and sought to correlate these profiles with response to AZD8931 in GC tumor xenograft models. High Her2 expression (IHC3+ or IHC2+/FISH+ve) was confirmed in 17.4% of tumours (20/115). Importantly, high level EGFR (44.4%, 48/108) and HER3 (89.3%, 92/103) protein expression was also detected in our cohort of Chinese GC samples.

To investigate the translational relevance of these data, primary GC models with varying HER family protein expression profiles were identified and established. Within these models, AZD8931 anti-tumor efficacy correlated broadly with strong HER pathway activation (0 to 83% TGI at 12.5mg/kg/bid).

        "Background":"['Gastric cancer is the world third leading cause of cancer mortality. In spite of the significant therapeutic advances, the overall clinical outcome for patients with advanced gastric cancer is poor, with 5-20% 5-year survival. The only targeted therapy approved so far are trastuzumab, and Ramucirumab which have given unsatisfactory results. Around 50% of gastric tumors bear genetic alterations affecting tyrosine kinase pathways (mainly EGFR, HER3, FGFR2 and MET pathways, besides HER2) but their clinical validation as tumor drivers is missing. The need for new therapeutic options and the possible presence of druggable targets prompted us to investigate potential targeted therapies for this disease.Our project aims at identifying and validating targeted therapeutic strategies in gastric cancer, through the generation of a platform of gastric tumor patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), animal models in which tumor surgical specimens are directly transferred into mice. Upon engraftment, the tumor is split and re-implanted in a cohort of mice, allowing the simultaneous testing of different drugs on the same tumor. Thanks to the establishment of a network of 15 Italian centers for samples collection, we generated around 80 gastric PDXs and successfully derived cell lines and organoids from engrafted tumors. Among the tumors collected so far, we found HER2, EGFR, FGFR2, MET and KRAS amplifications. This gastric PDX platform will be exploited for', ' 1) Validation of candidate oncogenes as relevant targets and identification of efficient therapeutic strategies 2) Identification of novel molecular targets; 3) identification of genetic predictors of response/resistance.In the PDX platform we identified one tumor bearing a high level of MET gene amplification (26 gene copies). We thus performed a preclinical study on a cohort of patient-derived xenografts generated from the MET-amplified gastroesophageal tumor. Despite the high amplification level, MET inhibitors induced only a partial response, while the combined anti-MET/EGFR treatment led to complete tumor regression. Most important, the combo treatment also prevented resistance onset. This data represent the proof of concept that a combined anti-MET/EGFR therapy can be more effective than anti-MET treatment alone in MET-amplified gastroesophageal tumors, in the absence of EGFR genetic lesions.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR (ErbB1), Her2 (ErbB2) and ErbB4 (Her4) function to transduce signals across the cell membrane in a wide variety of epithelial cells. ErbB dimerization results in the phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues, activating diverse signaling pathways. These downstream pathways culminate in a variety of cellular responses, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and migration. In addition, interactions between ErbB receptors provide a mechanism for signal differentiation and amplification. Dysregulation of ErbB mediated signaling confers a growth advantage, and can result in cellular transformation and/or increased tumor metastatic potential. ErbB family members have been well validated cancer targets. Both antibodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting individual ErbB receptors or both ErbB1/ErbB2 together have been approved for the treatment of human cancers. In addition, some ErbB targeting agents are in late stages of clinical testing.A large fraction of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, the most common and malignant primary brain tumor) harbors EGFRvIII activating mutation, and may represent an especially appropriate subgroup of this cancer for treatment with ErbB inhibitors.Results', ' NT113 is a potent and selective pan-ErbB family kinase inhibitor. It also inhibits known mutant EGFRs resistant to first generation EGFR inhibitors, including the T790M gate keeper mutant. NT113 inhibited proliferation of ErbB kinase driven cell lines, and GBM cell lines harboring EGFRvIII mutations.NT113 showed excellent oral PK in mouse and rat. rat, iv CL = 6.3 L/h/Kg, oral t1/2 = 15 h, F = 70%; mouse iv CL = 1.4 L/h/Kg, oral t1/2 = 16h, F = 100%. Importantly, NT113 showed significant brain exposure in rat oral PK studies, with brain/plasma ratio > 4 at 2, 4 and 24 hr time points, while afatinib brain level was not detectable at all 3 time points. If these PK results are maintained in human patients, it may lead to significant clinical activity. Longer half life would allow the drug to better permeate into tumor, while the brain penetrance is favorable for insuring the clinical activity of NT113 for CNS cancer, as well as for brain metastasis of NSCLC and breast cancers.In vivo, NT113 displayed excellent activities in NT87 gastric cancer xenograft models, and in NCI-H1975 (T790M gate keeper mutation) NSCLC xenograft models.

        "Background":"['Signaling by the Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activates multiple downstream signaling pathways that promote cell migration and invasive growth. Cells that overexpress and are addicted to Met also require Met signaling to sustain cell survival. Thus, a number of specific small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target Met in the clinic. Although several successes of RTK-targeted therapies are acknowledged, several have limited long-term success clinically, due to development of drug resistance. Initiation of RTK signaling cascades leads to the activation of a number of downstream signaling molecules, but prolonged activation also triggers negative feedback loops that function in part to abrogate this signaling. Hence, targeted inhibition of Met, in addition to suppressing Met-dependent signaling, may also release cells from negative feedback mechanisms and allow the reactivation of signaling pathways, that may promote resistance to Met inhibition. As MET amplification occurs in 10-20% of gastric cancers, to identify core Met dependent signaling pathways activated in Met dependent cancers we have used four different gastric cancer cell lines that exhibit amplification, overexpression, and constitutive activation of Met. Upon inhibition of Met with a small-molecule inhibitor, we observe abrogation of several downstream signaling pathways at both the protein phosphorylation and transcript level. Interestingly, as Met has been demonstrated to cross-talk with the EGF receptor family, we also observe a decrease in the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER3 upon treatment with Met inhibitor, and a decrease in expression of EGFR ligands. Conversely, Met inhibition results in an elevation in expression of HER3 transcript and protein in all 4 cell lines, implicating Met signaling in HER3 repression, and inhibition of Met may release HER3 from this negative regulation. As increases in HER3 phosphorylation and expression occur in other models (such as breast or lung cancer cell lines) upon treatment with EGFR, HER2, or AKT inhibitors, and high HER3 expression is strongly associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in gastric cancer; hence, the loss of negative regulation of HER3, downstream from Met, may ultimately contribute to clinical efficacy, or lack thereof, of Met inhibitors.']",

This study was to investigate antibody-nanoparticle conjugate (ANC) constructed with Herceptin and Abraxane (Herceptin/Abraxane) as a novel strategy of targeted therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive gastric cancer. Methods', ' Firstly, we fabricated the ANC with Herceptin and Abraxane by a one-step synthesis using EDC/NHS. In vitro study, the cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle of the positive HER2 gastric cancer NCI-N87 cells were measured and compared in four groups of PBS, paclitaxel (Taxol), nano- paclitaxel (Abraxane) and ANC (Herceptin/ Abraxane). In addition, we constructed gastric cancer xenograft model in nude mice to evaluate the targeted antitumor effect in vivo. Furthermore, we chose the NIR797 to locate on the ANC and use the NIR imaging to demonstrate that the ANC could more precise target and delayed release of paclitaxel. Results', ' ANC of Herceptin/Abraxane was spherical in shape and in a suitable size (289.18 nm102.6 nm). In vitro, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), defined as the concentration of Taxol equivalent needed to kill 50% of cells, was found to be 0.24, 0.13 and 0.048 g/ml for Taxol, Abraxane and ANC of Herceptin/Abraxane respectively for NCI-N87 cells with an excellent dose-effect relationship. Compared with Taxol and Abraxane, ANC of Herceptin/Abraxane could induce significant G2/M arrest. In vivo, at 4 weeks after treatment, mice treated by ANC of Herceptin/Abraxane had a mean tumor volume of 23324 mm3, Abraxane of 55997 mm3, Taxol of 87194 mm3 and PBS as control of 1576190 mm3. Obviously, the ANC could surpasses Abraxane and Taxol in reducing tumor volume with lesser side effects. Furthermore, NIRF imaging indicated a better targeting and sustained release of paclitaxel with ANC than that with Abraxane and Taxol. Conclusions', ' Antibody-nanoparticle conjugate of Herceptin/Abraxane could mediate targeted therapy and enhance antitumor activity, which could represent a novel targeted therapeutic agent for positive HER2 gastric cancer.']",

Though targeted therapies have been under clinical evaluation, the biological complexity of this cancer type may confer resistance to single-targeted therapies. Especially, scirrhous phenotype is known to be affected by multiple growth factors. To overcome this biological complexity, multi-targeted kinase inhibitors (MTKIs) have been clinically tested and were reported to be effective in a subset of patients. We wanted to elucidate the kinase activity signature of gastric cancer and to explore predictive biomarkers of MTKIs using gastric cancer cell lines by tyrosine kinase activity profiling.Material and methods', ' The growth-inhibitory effect of the MTKIs sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib and the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 was evaluated by the MTT assay. 11 scirrhous and 14 non-scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines were grown until semi-confluent, lysed, aliquoted and stored at -80C until use. The basal tyrosine kinase activity of the lysates was measured on PamChip peptide micro-arrays, containing 144 peptides derived from known human phosphorylation sites. Quantification of peptide phosphorylation and data analysis were performed using BioNavigator and SIMCA P+ software.Results', ' HSC-39, HSC-40A, KATO-III and HSC-43 scirrhous cells and SNU-16 non-scirrhous cells were sensitive to all three MTKIs with IC50 values < 1 mol/L. Orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of basal tyrosine kinase activity profiles showed a clear segregation between sensitive cell lines and insensitive cell lines. Levels of putative target proteins such as PDGFR, VEGFR, Raf and Kit did not correlate with the sensitivity. All sensitive cell lines turned out to harbor an FGFR2 amplification suggesting that FGFR2 amplification may be a predictive biomarker of response to MTKI treatment. Kinases such as EGFR, EPHA, FGFR, IGF1R, INSR and Src contributed to this segregation suggesting that these are relevant to the sensitivity to MTKIs. MET overexpressing cell lines were resistant to treatment with the four inhibitors. Scirrhous cells were segregated from non-scirrhous cells by OPLS-DA among cell lines with signet-ring cell carcinoma cytology with R2, 0.994; Q2, 0.615. EGFR, ERBB2, 3, 4, EPHAs, FAK, IGF1R, INSR, MAP2Ks, RET and SRC seemed to be responsible for the segregation suggesting that they play an important role in scirrhous gastric cancer biology.Conclusions', ' Kinase activity profiles reflect the biological complexity of gastric cancer. FGFR2 status correlates with sensitivity to sunitinib, pazopanib and sorafenib, whereas MET status does not. These data imply that tyrosine kinase activity profiling with PamChip peptide arrays can be utilized to identify molecular targets and predictive biomarkers in gastric cancer and this should be further explored.']",

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has become an attractive therapeutic target in treating cancers, due to its abnormally high expression in cancers. Several successful cases of HSP90 inhibitors capable of inhibiting GC inspired us to try ganetespib, a clinically promising and actively investigated second-generation HSP90 inhibitor in GC treatment. In our study, we show that ganetespib dramatically reduced growth of MGC-803 and also significantly inhibited growth of SGC-7901 and MKN-28 in a dose-dependent manner. It induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in all three cell lines, together with the related markers affected significantly. Mechanistically, ganetespib caused pronounced decrease of expression of classic HSP90 client proteins. Specifically, it greatly affected EGFR signaling cascades by dramatically decreasing levels of total EGFR and EGFR on cell membranes. EGFR knockdown also induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis accompanied with a decrease of several EGFR downstream proteins. These results strongly support EGFR signaling greatly contributes to the ganetespib inhibitory effects. Besides, we found the responses of GC cell lines to ganetespib correlated well with their EGFR expression levels', ' MGC-803, as well as AGS and BGC-803, with higher EGFR expression responded to ganetespib better, while SGC-7901 and MKN-28 with lower EGFR levels were much less sensitive to ganetespib. Though SGC-7901 and MKN-28 were not very sensitive to ganetespib, ganetespib worked synergistically with radiation and cisplatin in killing them. Importantly, ganetespib significantly inhibited growth of xenograft tumors in vivo as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin. Results of H&E staining, TUNEL assays, and immunohistochemistry staining of pCDK1, EGFR, and Ki-67 revealed significant differences in ganetespib-treated tumors.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Asian and Caucasian populations are distinct regarding the prevalence of different tumor types due to differences in lifestyle and genetics. The molecular makeup of tumors of the same type can also vary. When developing drugs for the treatment of stomach cancer it is important to study tumors in both Asian and Caucasian backgrounds. In East Asia stomach cancer is the 2nd most common malignancy. The development of patient derived xenografts (PDX) from patients of East Asian origin is therefore critical. Oncotest established xenografts from stomach cancer patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of their cancer at the Seoul National University, South Korea. These Asian gastric cancer xenografts (GXA) were utilized for the investigation of molecular characteristics and sensitivity to anticancer agents.Material and Methods', ' 78 gastric tumor samples from SNU were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice and sequentially passaged. Tumor material was collected for molecular profiling, including mutational analysis by Sanger sequencing and OncoCarta panels I, II, III. The efficacy of standard of care drugs 5-fluoruracil, cisplatin and taxol was tested in vivo.Results', ' From the 78 implantations we were able to establish 21 Asian patient-derived gastric cancer xenografts, representing a take rate of 27%. The majority of tumors from which GXA xenografts were derived were poorly or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. The panel also includes mucinous adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. The morphological features of the tumors (degree of differentiation) were preserved throughout serial passages.Mutational analysis for 18 established models revealed that TP53 (13/18, 72%), PTEN (6/9, as well as one with PTEN RNA levels too low for RT-PCR), KRAS (5/18, 28%) and PIK3CA (4/18, 22%) were frequently mutated in these gastric cancers. Mutations in EGFR, MLH1 and APC were also detected, but no mutations in NRAS (0/18) or BRAF (0/17) were found.Regarding sensitivity to anticancer agents, the response of the tumors varied strongly. Tumors were considered sensitive if the optimal treatment / control (T/C [%]) value was lower than 30%. 6 of 18 (33%) tumors were sensitive to 5-fluoruracil, 5 of 18 (28%) to paclitaxel and 3/18 (17 %) to cisplatin. Some gastric PDX were responsive to more than one chemotherapy, whereas 7 of 18 (39%) were not sensitive to any of these standard of care therapies.These results demonstrate (i) that standard of care therapies are not the therapy of choice for a large proportion of these tumors and (ii) great heterogeneity within the 18 analyzed gastric Asian patient- derived xenografts.Conclusion', ' In this study we developed a panel of Asian patient-derived gastric cancer xenografts with diverse molecular characteristics and responses to standard of care drugs.']",

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathway due to receptor overexpression, gene amplification, point mutations or fusions/chromosomal translocations is associated with cancer development and progression. In gastric cancer, alterations of FGFR2 are observed in a subset of patients, overexpression being more frequently observed as compared to FGFR2 amplifications. In addition, FGFR2 amplification and ERBB2, EGFR, MET and KRAS amplifications are mutually exclusive suggesting that FGFR targeted therapy would be most effective in the FGFR2-amplified subgroup of patients. Debio 1347 (CH5183284) is an oral selective FGFR inhibitor currently in clinical development. The aim of the study was to investigate the preclinical activity of Debio 1347 in patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models harboring diverse FGFR alterations in multiple indications, including gastric cancer.The mouse trial was conducted in 39 different PDX models selected according to FGFR1, 2 and 3 alterations status. Debio 1347 was administered orally once daily and tumor volume was monitored for 14 consecutive days. PDX tumors were extensively characterized using FISH, RNAseq, nCounter Gene Expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and FGFR molecular alterations were correlated with Debio 1347 efficacy. The level of tumor heterogeneity for FGFR2 amplification and expression and its impact on drug response were also assessed.In gastric cancer, Debio 1347 induced tumor regression in models harboring the commonly found FGFR2 amplification. Interestingly, Debio 1347 was also highly effective in models with high FGFR2 expression but without FGFR2 amplification, indicating that not only gene amplification drives the activity of Debio 1347 in this indication, but also the expression level of FGFR2.Altogether, these data demonstrate that Debio 1347 could be highly effective in gastric cancer patients harboring FGFR2 amplification and/or high FGFR2 expression.

MEDI4276 is a HER2-targeting, bispecific antibody linked to a novel anti-microtubule inhibitor called tubulysin.

Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2 based on its antibody component trastuzumab. After internalization of T-DM1/HER2, Lys-MCC-DM1, a tubulin binding agent is released in the cytoplasm. In spite of therapeutic advances, acquired resistance to treatment remains a major obstacle. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to T-DM1 is necessary to improve treatment regimens for HER2-overexpressing cancer patients. We have developed and characterized resistance models to T-DM1 in order to describe underlying resistance mechanisms and develop alternative strategies.Methods', ' To develop in vitro T-DM1 resistance models, HER2-overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE-19 was exposed to increasing doses of T-DM1 several months in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A (CsA, an inhibitor of MDR1 transporter). Resistance models were called OE-19 TR (exposed to T-DM1) and OE-19 TCR (exposed to T-DM1 and CsA). To characterize the resistance models, sensitivity to T-DM1 was assessed by MTT assay, Annexin V-PI staining and xCELLigence. Cell cycle distribution was assessed by propidium iodide using flow cytometry. Cross-resistance was studied by MTT assay. Expression of HER2, ABC transporters and tubulin was studied by rt-qPCR, flow cytometry and/or Western Blot. An expression profile of sensitive and resistant cells to T-DM1 was performed using a pan-genomic Illumina cDNA array.Results', ' After prolonged exposure of OE-19 cells to T-DM1, IC50 value is 18-fold higher in TR cells and 21-fold higher in TCR cells and both models become less sensitive to T-DM1-induced apoptosis. T-DM1 induced G2/M arrest in OE-19 sensitive cells but not in resistant cells. We found that resistant cells become less sensitive to trastuzumab but remain sensitive to other HER2-targeted therapies such as lapatinib, as well as to a variety of chemotherapy agents. Among the resistant cells, a subpopulation with increased expression MDR1 was identified in OE-19 TR and TCR. Concerning the expression of the main targets of T-DM1 (HER2 and tubulin); we found that HER2 expression and total  and  tubulin expression and content remained unchanged. However the isoforms 2 and 3 were overexpressed in both resistant models. A transcriptomic approach of T-DM1 resistant cells showed modification in adhesion junctions and focal adhesions.Conclusion', ' Prolonged exposure of the OE-19 cell line to T-DM1 resulted in resistance to this immunoconjugate. We are working on describing the resistance mechanisms to T-DM1, which are important to understand cancer progression in patients receiving this therapy.

        "Background":"['Despite breakthroughs in the clinical development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, challenges remain in overcoming resistance to these molecular targeted therapies. Advances in our understanding of mechanisms of resistance to targeted agents will improve patient outcome. While secondary mutations play a key role, the activation of parallel signaling pathways has been shown to alter the sensitivity to targeted inhibition. Resistance to inhibitors of the EGFR or VEGFR families may occur through the activation of Met, EphA2 and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, suggesting combined inhibition of these targets as a strategy to prevent resistance to approved EGFR- and VEGFRs -targeted therapies. We have developed a novel multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, MG516, with nanomolar activities in in vitro enzymatic assays against members of the Eph receptor family, Axl, Met and VEGFR1,2,3. In carcinoma cell lines, MG516 potently inhibits phosphorylation of EphA2, Axl and Met. Inhibition of Met downstream signaling as well as the inhibition of Met-dependent biological endpoints, such as motility and wound healing is also achieved. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs),VEGFR2 activation and VEGF-dependent angiogenesis are blocked. Potent anti-tumor activity is demonstrated across a broad range of human xenograft models including lung, gastric, glioblastoma, colorectal and breast carcinomas. Anti-tumor activity is achieved at oral doses as low as 2.5mg/kg in the absence of overt toxicity, weight loss or myelosuppression. Immunohistochemistry analyses of xenograft tumors after treatment with MG516 reveal a decrease in the proliferation of tumor cells, a decrease in tumor vascularization, pharmacodynamic inhibition of target phosphorylation and decreases in target expression, including EphA2. Consistent with targeting multiple oncogenic pathways simultaneously, the combination of MG516 with EGFR inhibition results in improved tumor growth inhibition. Importantly, in a gastric cancer model exhibiting resistance to sunitinib following prolonged treatment with this agent, MG516 induces tumor regression. Thus, MG516 offers potential for clinical development of a novel therapeutic, by targeting a combination of oncogenic kinases involved in tumor development, progression and resistance to targeted therapies.']",

Based on this result, we designed a prospective trial to test the feasibility of the ctDNA genomics and to test the matched therapy rate in metastatic cancer patients focusing on lung cancer, gastric cancer and melanoma. Methods', ' The trial was a prospective, master protocol, trial with ctDNA genomic profiling and several matched trials were aligned to this protocol as independent trials. Guardant360 is the first comprehensive NGS-based liquid biopsy for cancer which is a 70-gene blood test interrogating all four major types of genomic alterations. Results', ' From Aug 2014 to Feb 2016, 210 metastatic cancer patients participated in the trial. Of 210 patients, 200 patients had analyzable ctDNA sequencing data (10 patients excluded due to follow-up loss, withdrawal of consent, etc). 73 patients were lung cancer patients, 78 patients were gastric cancer patients, 36 were melanoma patients and the remaining were rare cancer. The major alterations that were found in ctDNA were EGFR amplification, ERBB2 amplification, MET amplification, PIK3CA H1047R/E545K, TP 53 mutations, KRAS Q12, RET fusion, ALK fusion, EGFR mutation, and KIT mutation. Based on the ctDNA sequencing data, patients were directed to the matched therapy in the context of clinical trials or in clinical practice. The median turnaround time from blood draw to the sequencing report was 14 days.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and currently sorafenib is the only drug approved for advanced HCC. In the pivotal studies, sorafenib increased the median survival by only three months and there is an urgent need for additional HCC therapies. Several studies have implicated dysregulation of HER signaling in HCC and there is strong scientific rationale for testing of pan-HER therapies in HCC. Methods', ' We tested the anti-tumour activity of Varlitinib as a single agent in patient-derived HCC xenograft in SCID mice (HCC29-0909A) with co-expression of HER1, HER2 and HER3 recepors. Dosing with Varlitinib commenced when the tumours reached the size of approximately 100-150 mm3. Bi-dimensional measurements are performed twice a week and tumour volumes are calculated based on the following formula', ' Tumour volume = [(Length) x (Width2) x (p/6)]. Results', ' Varlitinib treatment potently inhibited tumour growth with complete tumor regression observed at dosing of 100 mg/kg BID. In addition, Varlitinib was well tolerated at all dose levels. Western blot analysis of tumour lysates taken after five days of Varlitinib treatment revealed that phosphorylation of HER1-3, RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK, p70S6K, S6 ribosomal, 4EBP1, Cdk-2, Cdc-2 and retinoblastoma were strongly inhibited. Furthermore Varlitinib treatment resulted in a significant reduction in survivin and a concomittant increase in Caspase 3 cleavage products. Conclusions', ' Our data suggest that Varlitinib potently inhibited cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. In the clinical setting Varlitinib has already demonstrated impressive efficacy in breast cancer, gastric cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal carcinoma with a greatly improved toxicity profile compared to irreversible pan-Her inhibitors such as Neratinib and Dacomitinib.

        "Background":"['MGCD265 is an oral, multitargeted, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development. MGCD265 targets the Met, VEGFR1, 2, 3, Tie2 and Ron receptor tyrosine kinases and blocks key pathways regulating cancer development and progression. Met-targeted agents, including MGCD265, have shown early signs of clinical activities when combined with EGFR inhibitors. While this combination is supported by a large body of evidence indicating that Met and EGFR functionally cooperate to amplify activating signals, how the combination of agents targeting these two pathways leads to efficient anti-tumor responses remains to be elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that the combination of MGCD265 with erlotinib achieved greater tumor growth inhibition than treatment with either agent alone in multiple xenografts including a gastric cancer model in which Met is amplified (MKN45). We performed gene expression analyses in this model to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficient anti-tumor activities of MGCD265 in combination with erlotinib. While these studies revealed the inhibition of cell growth and the induction of apoptosis pathways as enhanced by this combination, the regulation of glycolysis surfaced as a novel pathway altered by this combination. Although genes regulating this pathway were partly downmodulated by either agent alone, the combination significantly enhanced this effect. A key mediator of glycolysis, hexokinase 2 (HK2), known to be elevated in cancer cells and essential for the switch to aerobic glycolysis as well as for mitochondrial-initiated cell death, was significantly downregulated by the combination. Furthermore, PFKFB3, PGK, ENO1, PKM2 were also inhibited by the combination. These results suggest that regulating tumor cell glycolysis may present a novel pathway through which MGCD265 could block tumor cell growth. Thus, the inhibition of multiple molecular pathways involved in cancer growth and progression provides a rationale for the clinical development of MGCD265 in combination with erlotinib. Early results from an ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial of MGCD265 in combination with erlotinib has demonstrated encouraging signs of activity in gastric cancer patients.']",

Up to 20% of breast and gastric cancer show ERBB2 gene amplification and anti-HER2 targeting therapies are well established for these tumors. In other tumor entities such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer and bladder cancer the fraction of ERBB2 amplified tumors is considerably lower. In contrast to breast cancer, these tumors show heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in a substantial proportion. Oncogenic EGFR mutation with subsequent EGFR amplification is a common phenomenon in lung cancer. In analogy, primary ERBB2 mutation could explain the observed heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in some tumors. Methods', '  100 tumors showing ERBB2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization were examined for ERBB2 mutation', ' 50 breast cancer samples, including 10 cases with borderline gene amplification, 10 cases with heterogeneous gene amplification and 11 samples of metastatic lesions as well as 15 colorectal carcinomas, 12 gastric carcinomas, 12 non-small cell lung cancers and 10 urothelial carcinomas. Tumor DNA was extracted and examined for mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-23) of the ERBB2 gene by Sanger sequencing.

The semi-quantitative chromatograms show an overrepresentation of the mutations indicating a selective amplification of the mutated allele. Conclusions', '  In certain tumor entities the heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification indicates a late genetic event. The finding of a concomitant mutation in ERBB2 amplified tumors might explain the heterogeneity in some of these tumors.

Positivity rate in primary resection specimens was 11.5% (n=12), while after preoperative CRT 13.2% (n=78 ) patients showed a HER-2 positive tumor; 13.1% (n=43) after 5-FU mono and 13.3% (n=35) after combination of 5-FU and oxaliplatin.  There was no prognostic difference according to the HER-2 status regarding TTR (p=0.90) and CSS (p=0.68) overall. However in the 5-FU mono subgroup the HER-2 expression was of prognostic relevance as measured by CSS (p=0.034).

Gastric adenocarcinoma, the most common type of gastric cancer, is heterogeneous and its incidence and cause varies widely with geographical regions, gender, ethnicity, and diet. Since unique mutations have been observed in individual human cancer sample, identification and characterization of the molecular alterations underlying individual gastric adenocarcinoma is a critical step for developing more effective, personalized therapies. Until recently, identifying genetic mutations in an individual basis by DNA sequencing remains a daunting task. The recent advance of new next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as the semiconductor-based Ion Torrent sequencing platform, makes DNA sequencing cheaper, faster and more reliable.  Methods', '  In this study, we aim to identify genetic mutations in the genes, which are targeted by drugs in the clinical use or under development, in individual human adenocarcinoma sample by using Ion Torrent sequencing. We sequenced 739 loci from 46 cancer-related genes in 242 human gastric adenocarcinoma samples using the Ion Torrent Ampliseq Cancer Panel.  Results', '  The sequencing analysis revealed frequent mutations in MLH1 (8.3%), MET (11.2%), KIT (21.5%), and PIK3CA (40.5%) genes in the human gastric adenocarcinomic samples.

HER2 is overexpressed in several cancer (Ca) types and is one of the most strongly validated targets for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer serving as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker. Several HER2-targeting antibodies as well as antibody-drug conjugates are either approved or are in clinical development. Prolonged treatment with monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates have resulted in development of resistance and so there is still an unmet medical need for drugs of new mechanism of action targeting this important receptor system. We describe herein the generation of a high energy, alpha-particle emitting HER2 targeted thorium-227 antibody-chelator conjugate. HER2-TTC consists of the humanized HER2 targeting IgG1 antibody (trastuzumab) covalently linked via an amide bond to a 3,2-hydroxypyridino-based chelator moiety, enabling efficient radiolabeling with the alpha particle emitting radionuclide thorium-227 (Th-227). HER2-TTC was prepared at high radiochemical yield and purity. When tested for binding to recombinant HER2, HER2-TTC was shown to retain comparable binding affinity to trastuzumab. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments were performed on 8 cell lines with different HER2 expression levels (from 7 000 - 500 000 mAbs bound/ cell as determined by FACS) of breast, ovarian, gastric and lung cancer origin. HER2-TTC demonstrated target mediated in vitro cytotoxicity in the pM-range. In vivo biodistribution and anti-tumor efficacy of HER2-TTC was evaluated in the dose range 100-500 kBq/kg at a protein dose of 0.14 mg/kg and i.v. injection in the s.c.

The biodistribution study demonstrated specific tumor accumulation of HER2-TTC in both models with a maximum of 77 and 50 %ID/g 227Th at t = 168 h post dose (decay corrected to T0), respectively. Significant antitumor efficacy was shown for HER2-TTC in the JIMT-1 s.c. breast Ca xenograft model resistant to trastuzumab and T-DM1.

Patient stratification in clinical trials based on molecular features has contributed to recent success of several targeted cancer drugs on molecular aberrations such as BCR-ABL translocation in CML, Her2 amplification in breast and gastric cancers, EGFR mutations and ALK fusions in lung cancer and BRAF mutation in melanoma. However, in most cancers, the molecular features which can be used for patient stratification are not as simple as a single genetic aberration. Multiple drug resistance mechanisms caused by various mutations in cancer signaling pathways can also increase the uncertainty of clinical outcomes.To increase the chance of success in human clinical studies, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) clinical trials (PCTs) have increasingly been used for predictive biomarker validation, resistance mechanism investigation and combination therapy selection. PDX tumor models have been demonstrated to have high correlations with human patients in tumor pathology, molecular characteristics and drug responses. Large scale PCTs have also shown consistency in results when compared to related human clinical trials.At GenenDesign, we have established over 1000 PDX tumor models and more than 100 resistance models against various cancer drugs. Many of these PDX models have been characterized at RNA/Exome sequence, gene expression, gene copy number and hot-spot mutation levels. We carried out our PDX clinical trials by testing multiple approved drugs and clinical drug candidates such as targeted inhibitors against FGFRs, c-Met/ALK, HER2, EGFR, cell cycle regulators, Ras/Raf pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, as well as chemotherapy drugs in biomarker-driven multi-drug multi-arm expanded PDX clinical trials. So far, we have accumulated more than 3000 efficacy data sets and associated PD samples.Analysis of drug response and associated genomic information from PDX clinical trials yielded rich information for predictive biomarker identification and validation. At the same time, many potential resistance mechanisms were also revealed. These information can make human clinical trial better prepared, more efficient and focused.

        "Background":"['Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a common malignancy that causes approximately 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. So far, no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of the disease. In the present study, we built an in-house oligonucleotide array, on which 394 genes were selected based on our SAGE data and previously reported array data, in order to identify the genes of most relevance to gastric carcinogenesis. Among these genes, we focused on SEC11A, because it is frequently overexpressed in gastric cancer (GC). SEC11A encodes the SPC18 protein, which is one of the subunits of the signal peptidase complex (SPC). Most secretory proteins contain amino terminal- or internal signal peptides that direct their sorting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the ER, proteins are transported to either the extracellular space or the plasma membrane through the ER-Golgi secretory pathway. The ER signal peptides are then cleaved by the SPC. In GC, SPC18 contributes to progression via EGFR pathway associated with TGF-a secretion. However, the expression and function of SPC18 have not been investigated in bladder cancer (BC). In this study, we analyzed the expression and distribution of SPC18 in human BC. Expression of SPC18 was observed in 44 (54.3%) out of 81 BC cases that was associated with T category (p=0.0002), Grade (p=0.0425), vascular invasion (p=0.0112) and CK5/6 positive/ CK20 negative basal type BC (p=0.0004). The univariate analysis indicated that expression of SPC18 (HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.47-7.47; P=0.0027) was associated with overall survival. In the multivariate model, SPC18 expression was an independent prognostic indicator (HR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.35-10.00; P=0.0087).

Methods', '  We modified the Cellsearchplatform by using nanomagnetic particles conjugated to antibodies against c-MET to capture c-MET-expressing CTCs and stained for c-MET-PE, DAPI, and pan-CK-FITC. CD45 + cells were excluded. The method was validated by spiking MET-amplified gastric cancer cells, c-MET-overexpressing, nonamplified cancer cells, and MET-negative cancer cells into peripheral blood from healthy volunteers (HVs). Peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients (pts) with refractory metastatic gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, bladder, renal, and prostate cancers. CTC enumeration with c-MET capture was compared to EpCAM capture. After CTC isolation, DNA FISH for MET amplification was performed.  Results', '  The novel c-MET CTC assay was 80% sensitive for MET-amplified cells, 40-80% sensitive for c-MET-overexpressed cells, and 100% specific for c-MET negative cells and in 20 HVs. Of 50 pts tested thus far, we captured c-MET CTCs in duplicate samples from 3 pts, with gastric adenocarcinoma (90 and 52 c-MET CTCs), colorectal adenocarcinoma (7 and 2 c-MET CTCs), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 3 and 1 c-MET CTCs). CTC FISH demonstrated polysomy 7 and MET amplification in both gastric and colorectal cancer pts and trisomy 7 with gain of MET gene copies in the RCC pt.  Conclusions', '  The c-MET CTC assay is rapid, non-invasive, sensitive and specific. c-MET expressing CTCs can be detected in gastric, colorectal, and renal cancers but not negative controls. MET amplification can be detected using FISH after CTC capture, leveraging this technology as a potential minimally invasive liquid biopsy.

The median interval between PUD and RGC resections was 34.8 years (7-60 years). By Lauren's classification, 60% of the tumors were intestinal, 23% diffuse and 17% mixed. Most of the tumors (47%) were poorly differentiated and stage II (40%). MSK-IMPACT sequencing revealed 299 total somatic alterations occurring in 148 of 410 targeted genes with a median number of non-synonymous somatic mutations and copy number events of 3 and 1 per patient, respectively. Of the 207 total mutations, 27.5% were hotspot COSMIC and 23.2% were loss-of-function mutations. Recurrent genomic events included mutually exclusive mutations in TP53 (33%) and amplifications in MDM2 (26%), alterations in the ERBB family genes (37%), ARID1A (16%), KMT2D (13%), CDH1 (13%), and CDK4 (13%). In addition, actionable alterations in PIK3CA (10%), FGFR1 (4%), PTEN (4%), and concurrent hotspot KRAS mutations and inactivation of p15/p16 (10%) were observed. Compared to the sporadic GC cases, RGC cases presented differences in the landscape and recurrence of alterations.Conclusion\", ' The pathogenesis of RGC is likely associated with the prolonged exposure of the gastric mucosa to gastroduodenal contents. The mean age of patients may also exert effects on the development of the RGC. Based on our sequencing results, RGC may present a genetic profile distinct from that of sporadic gastric tumors. Assessment of these alterations identified 30% of patients with potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease and deserves further investigation.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Rapid advances in immunotherapy have created a need for biomarkers to improve patient treatment selection. TML is proposed as a potential predictive biomarker due to its association with tumor immunogenicity. Methods', ' TML was assessed in 8020 tumors from 14 different cancers using somatic nonsynonymous missense mutations sequenced with a 592-gene panel. High TML was set at  17 mutations per megabase (mt/MB) based on an established concordance ( > 99%) with MSI-High in colorectal cancer (CRC). Results', ' Mean TML was highest in melanoma (Mel; 21 mt/MB), NSCLC (11 mt/MB), and bladder cancer (BLC; 11 mt/MB), whereas prostate cancer (PC), pancreas adenocarcinoma (PA), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) had the lowest levels (all 6 mt/MB). High TML was seen most frequently in Mel (36%), NSCLC (15%), BLC (15%), and anal cancer (SCCA; 9%); and least frequently in PA (1.6%) and RCC (0.5%). Primary NSCLC carried lower TML than its brain metastases (11 vs. 16 mt/MB, p < 0.001). Older age was associated with higher TML in Mel (p = 0.001), CRC (p = 0.009), breast cancer (BC; p = 0.01), and NSCLC (p = 0.02). Higher TML was seen in males than in females for Mel (p = 0.002) and NSCLC (p < 0.001). Presence of mutations in oncogenic driver genes such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1 RET fusions, cMET exon 14 skipping correlated with lower TML in NSCLC (6.9 vs. 12 mt/MB, p < 0.001), as did BRAF and NRAS mutations in Mel (17 vs. 26, p = 0.003). Conversely, mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as ARID1A (CRC, NSCLC, and BLC) and NF1 (BC, CRC, Mel, BLC, and NSCLC) were associated with higher TML (p < 0.05). MSI-high was correlated with high TML in CRC and gastric cancers (p < 0.05). Conclusions', ' TML varied significantly among different cancers. High TML was associated with older age, absence of oncogenic mutations and presence of tumor suppressor gene mutations. Future studies will assess the impact of TML on clinical outcome and establish its role in selecting patients for immunotherapy.

        "Background":"[\"Long duration inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases the risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). Mutation analysis of limited numbers of genes has suggested that CRCs arising in an IBD background differ from those that do not. We sought to characterize the genetic landscape of these tumors through whole-exome sequencing.Thirty-one IBD patients with CRC were identified, including 15 with ulcerative colitis, 14 with Crohn's disease and 2 with indeterminate colitis. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on micro-dissected tumor and matched non-neoplastic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Somatic alterations were identified by comparing matched specimens. Mutation prevalence in sporadic CRC was obtained from previously published exome-sequencing studies.An average of 11.6 Gb were sequenced per sample. The depth of quality coverage of the targeted region was 29 to 100-fold in the tumors; and 17- to 123-fold in non-tumor samples. Two specimens harbored somatic mutations in the DNA proofreading or mismatch repair genes POLE, MLH1 and MSH6 and exhibited hypermutable phenotype. The remaining cases had a median mutation rate of 1.33 mutations/Mb and an average of 71 alterations per sample. The pattern of base changes in non-hypermutated tumors showed a preponderance of C to T transitions (62%), a majority of which (48% of all mutations) occurred at 5-CpG-3 sites. An excess of A to C transversions at AA dinucleotides, particularly in a context of AAG trinucleotides, was also noted. This pattern has been previously observed in esophageal and gastric cancers, both of which are also tied to chronic inflammation. There were no apparent differences in the spectrum of substitutions between tumors arising in UC and CD patients. We identified 28 genes recurrently mutated in three or more non-hypermutated samples. TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene, with incidence prevalence similar to sporadic CRC (63% of cases), but with different mutation spectrum. APC and KRAS were mutated at significantly lower rates than in sporadic CRCs (13% and 20% of cases, respectively). Genes mutated more commonly or uniquely in IBD-CRC, included SOX9 and EP300, encoding proteins in the WNT pathway, NRG1, encoding an ERBB ligand, and IL16, encoding a cytokine. Three cases featured hotspot PIK3CA mutations. Likely oncogenic driver gene mutations in BRAF, CTNNB1, and CREBBP were found in one case each. Mutated genes were enriched for gene ontologies associated with cell communication, cell-cell signaling, and cell adhesion. Our study also revealed recurrent mutations in components of the Rho/Rac GTPase network, suggesting a role for non-canonical WNT signaling in IBD-CRC.CRCs arising in IBD patients demonstrate a unique molecular profile, which provides clues to their etiology. Our study also sets the stage for improved early detection of IBD-associated CRCs based on their unique genetic compositions as well as for the tailoring of therapies in this patient population.\"]",

        "Background":"['The interaction between the c-MET tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) on the surface of cancer cells with its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secreted from surrounding tumor stroma, results in paracrine signal transduction in cancer cells to promote growth, invasion, angiogenesis and metastases. c-MET gene amplification/over-expression, or activating mutations, frequently function as oncogenic driver in several types of cancers. c-MET is thus considered a key target(1) for both TKIs or biologics. However, lack of suitable animal models has represented an obstacle for the development of new cMET inhibitors. While patient derived xenografts (PDXs) mirror patients histopathological/genetic profiles(2-6), they usually lose human stroma, the source of HGF; moreover the HGF originated from murine stroma is incapable of triggering a paracrine signaling because of lack of cross reactivity with the human c-MET. Some PDX grow independent of paracrine mechanisms because of their constitutive c-MET activation by the presence of activating mutations, gene amplification or autocrine signaling, and can be used to evaluate the efficacy of TKIs(5, 7, 8). However they are not suitable to assess biologics, e.g. antibodies disrupting receptor-ligand interaction. Alternatively it is possible to grow tumors in hu-HGF-transgenic immunocompromised mice (humanization) where an artificial paracrine signaling is created. Interestingly, we have identified a unique HCC-PDX, LI0801, which maintains human stroma throughout passages, as demonstrated by immunochemistry staining for human vimentine and human HGF, both markers of stromal components(7, 8). The mechanisms of human stroma maintenance in this PDXremain unclear. We showed that LI0801 responds to different TKIs(7, 8). In addition we evaluated the efficacy of an anti-human c-MET monoclonal antibody in reducing tumor burden in LI0801, and we were able to demonstrate great tumor response to anti-human c-MET antibody, which is significantly more effective than crizotinib. To the best of our knowledge, LI0801 is the first paracrine c-MET PDX reported, and represents an important model to study paracrine cMET/HGF signaling and to evaluate new c-MET inhibitors, both TKIs, and biologics.References1.
