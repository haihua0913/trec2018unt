Preclinical studies report a critical role of c-KIT amplification and mutations in mucosal, acral, and solar melanomas. Preliminary data from clinical trials of KIT-directed therapy suggest their potential efficacy in these subtypes of melanomas.

E2607 tests the efficacy of dasatinib in treatment-naive or previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma with these subtypes. Methods', ' We plan to enroll up to 110 patients with acral (palms, soles, or subungual sites), mucosal, or cutaneous melanomas with chronic sun damage (solar elastosis in the skin adjacent to the melanoma). Solar elastosis must be confirmed centrally. Patients receive dasatinib 70 mg PO twice daily on an open-label, single-arm basis. Cycle length is 21 days, without breaks between cycles. The primary endpoint is objective tumor response rate for dasatinib using RECIST criteria. Secondary objectives include response duration, progression-free survival, and safety. Correlative studies include assessing KIT expression, amplification and mutation, PDGFR expression, and SFK activation in tumor samples and correlating these findings with response. The study is designed in two stages, with accrual open to molecularly proven KIT+ and KIT- patients in the first stage. If responses are seen only in KIT+ patients at interim analysis (n=56 patients), strictly KIT+ patients will be enrolled (n=22 in each melanoma subtype). If response rate appears unrelated to KIT status, with response rate of at least 20%, the study will remain open to all patients (n=110).']",

Follow-up biopsies were tested for c-KIT secondary mutations, gene copy number variation and expression related to angiogenesis, apoptosis and proliferation. IHC staining was performed on sections at baseline and after treatment for c-KIT, p-ERK, p-AKT and p-MEK.  Results', '  C-KIT expression was confirmed in all patients treated with nilotinib at baseline. The presence of a c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations was associated with clinical response.

        "Background":"['Melanoma causes the greatest morbidity and mortality of all skin cancers and often harbors amplifications or activating mutations in KIT, a type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) involved in cancer cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. At present, no treatment that provide either sufficient response rates or a significant prolongation of overall survival are available for melanoma. In the last decade, several inhibitors of RTK (RTKi) have been developed for the treatment of cancer, however, a number of short-comings was observed. Therefore, novel TK inhibitors with improved selectivity were developed for the treatment of diseases associated with KIT activation. Masitinib (AB1010), a RTKi capable of blocking selectively KIT, is one such new drug. Using B16 melanoma subcutaneous graft on C57Bl6 mice, we demonstrate that Masitinib is able to limit tumor growth in vivo and increase mice survival. This anti-tumoral effect was not observed for other RTKi targeting KIT. Suprisingly, Masitinib has no effect on melanoma proliferation in vitro, suggesting instead that modulation on tumor environment takes place. Indeed, mast cells that accumulate in the tumors secrete several biologically active factors involved in the modulation of tumor growth. In vivo, Masitinib treatment completely abrogates mast cell maturation and migration resulting in decreased tumor invasion and down-regulation of several angiogenic factors. Using a mouse line deficient for mast cells (Wsh/Wsh), we confirmed that Masitinib effect is in part dependent of its inhibition on mast cell migration and maturation. Indeed, additional effect occurs on macrophage polarization leaning from tolerogenic toward anti-tumoral phenotype. Furthermore, in vivo macrophage depletion favored tumor promotion and reverses Masitinib effect on tumor growth. The results provided by this study suggest that Masitinib may be a useful therapy on melanoma by its dual role on tumor environment. It can block mast cell maturation and infiltration in the tumor site, avoiding the angiogenic effects of mast cells. It can revert tumor tolerent macrophage status leading to an increased inflammatory activity within the tumor microenvironment.These effects are not observed only on melanoma, but also on other types of cancer, suggesting the cellular mechanisms triggered by Masitinib occur in various tumoral process. For instance, a phase III clinical trial with Masitinib as GIST treatment is currently ongoing.']",

The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA = 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions', ' The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills.

Uveal melanoma is characterized by oncogenic mutations in Gnaq and Gna11, which activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK). Furthermore, both primary and metastatic UM are characterized by genetic abnormalities, including the amplification of the chromosomal arm 8q and monosomy of chromosome 3, which are significantly associated with poor prognosis. The oncogene MYC, which is located on 8q24.1, is amplified in nearly 70% of uveal melanoma, and is also regulated by the MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulators have become attractive targets for cancer therapy. In particular, the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 has shown selective inhibition of c-Myc expression, followed by the suppression of c-Myc-dependent target genes. We examined the effects of JQ1 in a panel of 8 UM cell lines, including cell lines with Gnaq/Gna11 mutations (92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202, Omm1), a cell line with MYC amplification (Mel290), and cells without either mutation or amplification (C918, Mel285). The Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells were the most sensitive to growth inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of JQ1 (IC50=200nM), followed by the cell line with amplified MYC (IC50=1M), while the cells without mutation or amplification exhibited little inhibition. We also examined the biochemical effects of JQ1 treatment, which caused a dose- and time-dependent suppression of c-Myc as well as survivin, XIAP, ERK1 and E2F1, while p21and the pro-apoptotic protein Bim were induced in all the cell lines. Interestingly, JQ1 also suppressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and induced PARP cleavage only in the Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated a cell cycle arrest in G1 in all the cell lines and an apoptotic population in sub-G1in the mutant cells.

        "Background":"['The BRAFV600E mutation is frequently observed in over 60% of melanomas. Development of the small molecule inhibitor PLX4032, which specifically targets the mutated BRAF protein, offers a novel therapeutic approach by effectively blocking the activation of key signaling molecules of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such as Mek and Erk, effectively leading to arrest in cell proliferation. Provided that MAPK signaling targets the micropthalmia transcription factor (MITF), which is linked to the expression of various melanoma associated antigens (MAAs), we hypothesized that the inhibition of BRAFV600E can modulate the expression of MAAs. Since MAAs are essential in the development of a melanoma vaccine, due to their increased immunogenicity, altering their expression can be a useful immunotherapeutic approach to targeting melanoma. Using patient derived melanoma cell lines, which express various MAAs; our laboratory has developed a vaccinia virus based immunotherapeutic vaccine. These melanoma cell lines have been characterized by their status of BRAFV600E mutation and found to be either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutation. Inhibition of two key MAPK pathway molecules, namely Mek and Erk, denotes that the melanoma cell lines are responsive to PLX4032. Phenotypically, the cells invasive and migratory properties were also modulated upon treatment with PLX4032. Moreover, we observed that the expression of various MAAs was enhanced upon treatment with PLX4032. An amplification of gp100, MART-1 and tyrosinase expression on the RNA level as well as on the protein level was observed. Lastly, expression of MMAs was conserved in vivo following the analysis of melanoma cell xenografts in BALB/c nude mice. Based on our observations in that PLX4032 modulates MMA expression, further studies are warranted to determine the clinical effectiveness of combinational immunologic therapy using BRAFV600E inhibitors with our vaccinia virus melanoma cell line derived preparation.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', 'Plasma cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to serve as a noninvasive surrogate to determine tumor genotype and monitor treatment response. Here we report the analytical validation of the Ion AmpliSeq v2 Cancer Panel (ACP) in plasma ctDNA samples.Methods', 'Mutations were assessed using the ACP, designed to survey 2800 mutations in 50 cancer-related genes. TruQ reference standards were used to determine LOD. Healthy donor and cancer patient plasma samples were used for other studies. Eight libraries were barcoded and sequenced with PGM sequencing 200 kit v2 on a 318 v2 chip. The sequencing data were analyzed with a combination of Torrent Suite 3.4.2, VarScan, our proprietary analysis pipeline and IGV. The background noise level of hotspot nt positions was calculated from multiple runs of known wild type DNA. In order to increase the sensitivity of the assay to detect low-level mutation, a custom program was developed to detect variants clearly different from background noise (95% confidence) and not reported by the two variant callers. PCR methods were used for concordance testing.Results', 'The performance characteristics of the AmpliSeq v2 Cancer Panel were demonstrated in 1) Minimum DNA input and LOD', ' With 10 ng DNA input, 43/43 and 42/43 expected mutations were detected at 2.5% or 1%, respectively. With 1 ng DNA input, 42/43 and 40/43 expected mutations were detected at 2.5% and 1%, respectively. 2) Coverage', ' The mean library coverage for 40 plasma libraries was 2912x with only 5 non-critical regions below 250x coverage. 3) Baseline error rate', ' 95% of 2290 hot-spots for SBS showed <0.5% background error frequency assessed in 10 healthy control ctDNA samples. The mean background error frequency plus two folds of SD falls below 0.5% for 91% of SBS hot-spots. 4)Precision', ' All mutations expected for TruQ6 were detected in 4 independent runs at observed allele frequencies with 0.6% mean SD and 0.1% mean deviation from the true value. A 2% TP53 mutation R174W was reproducibly detected in a lung cancer plasma sample in 2 independent runs. 5) Concordance study', ' Consistent results were observed for 3 positive (Allele Freq 40%, 3% and 0.2%, respectively) and 3 negative melanoma plasma samples previously genotyped by AS-PCR for Braf V600E/K mutations. Additional cancer patient ctDNA samples are being assessed for concordance in the detection of other mutations.Conclusions', 'The ACP offers a useful tool for comprehensive somatic mutation profiling in ctDNA. The limit of detection is 1-2% mutation frequency for most mutations with slight variation across different nucleotide positions. The low concentration of ctDNA obtained from plasma samples can present a challenge. Less than 10 ng DNA input may result in allele drop out for low level mutations due to the inefficient amplification of multiplex PCR compared with PCR methods using a short length single amplicon. Higher DNA input to rescue allele drop-out is under evaluation.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma has seen a remarkable improvement in the treatment of advanced disease. However, the majority of patients still relapse with the emergence of resistant disease. This is especially true for BRAF inhibitors, were multiple mechanisms of resistance have been uncovered. However, the lack of dependable models to develop approaches to overcome resistance, poses a real challenge for clinical decisions on second line therapies. In addition, combination therapies necessary to achieve long term responses increase the number of possibilities to be assessed. In this study, we developed patient derived xenograft (PDX) models from BRAF inhibitor resistant patients and, after characterization, tested rational second line combination therapies in co-clinical trials.Fresh tumor tissue from 12 patients after progression on vemurafenib or dabrafenib was implanted into immune deficient NSG mice. Once the tumor grafts were established, mice were continually dosed with PLX4720 to approximate clinical plasma levels to preserve the resistant phenotype. Xenografts were then characterized for genomic alterations and pathway activation status using a targeted sequencing array and a reverse phase protein array, respectively. We found at least 2 and up to 9 known deleterious alterations in all samples, many of which have been described as conferring resistance. The protein array clustered into two major groups', ' MAPK pathway activated and PI3K pathway activated, again consistent with previous reports. Integrating these data allowed us to design rational combination therapies for in vivo testing. We treated a PDX model with MET amplification and high phospho c-Met with the BRAF inhibitor LGX818 20mg/kg QD, the MEK inhibitor MEK162 3mg/kg QD, and the c-Met inhibitor INC280 25mg/kg QD (all p.o.). Although INC280 alone led to significant decrease in tumor growth, only the LGX818/ MEK162/ INC280 triple combination led to complete and sustained tumor regression in all mice. Further, we tested a second PDX model with a MET amplification (albeit broader and lower) but baseline pMET on the protein level. In this model, INC280 did not show any antitumor effect confirming the specificity for c-Met and the importance of validating genomic data.In summary, using our BRAF inhibitor resistant PDX model pipeline we were not only able to identify actionable alterations in all models, but also to test rational second line combination therapies in pre-clinical in vivo trials. Genomic data alone might not be sufficient to accurately predict therapy responses and protein arrays were a valuable tool to validate deleterious alteration calls. This study represents an important step towards improving personalized medicine in melanoma, and highlights the potential use of c-Met inhibitors in melanoma combination therapy in a defined subset of patients.']",

        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignancy with high tendency to metastasize to the liver. The majority of UM harbor activating mutations in the G proteins Gnaq/11, and amplification of the oncogene c-Myc. Currently available drugs have shown limited response in patients with UM and there is an urgent need for new effective therapies. Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated that UM cells with Gnaq/11 mutations are dependent on BRD4 activity. BET proteins are epigenetic readers involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4 inhibitors consist of small molecules that competitively displace BRD4 from acetylated histones, resulting in the suppression of the MYC transcriptome and other BRD4-dependent genes. Here, we report that a novel clinical BRD4 inhibitor from Plexxikon (Berkeley, CA), PLX51107, induces high cytotoxic activity in UM cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. In cells with Gnaq/11 mutations, PLX51107 showed an IC50 of 250nM, similar to the pre-clinical compound JQ1. In contrast, PLX51107 did not have a significant effect (IC50>3000nM) in cells without the mutations. PLX51107 induced marked apoptosis in Gnaq/11 mutant cells, as detected by Annexin V staining and induction of cleaved PARP. It also suppressed the expression of BRD4 targets, i.e c-Myc, Rad51, and induced the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. In mouse xenograft models of UM PLX51107 significantly inhibited tumor growth. Since the MAPK pathway plays a major role in UM, we explored the combination of PLX51107 with a MEK inhibitor, and found increased activity in vitro and in vivo. All together, these observations support the idea that this clinical BRD4 inhibitor represents a novel therapeutic intervention against UM with Gnaq/11 mutations, and clinical development is planned.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are known for high MYC expression. MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine analogue and a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor. 131I-MIBG has been used for scintigraphic detection of neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma and melanoma) that specifically uptake MIBG by norepinephrine transporters (NET). 131I-MIBG is also used for targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Non-radiolabeled MIBG had been reported to be cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of its growth suppressive effect was not elucidated. Our previous studies showed that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. In this study we confirmed that MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma cell lines (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5, Nb69, and SKNAS), and its growth suppressive effect in each cell line correlated with NET expression in these cells. In addition, MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma stem cells derived from SKNBE(2)C. MIBG treatment of SKNBE(2)C and SKNAS resulted in an increase expression of growth suppressive gene (GADD45B) and genes encoding for biomarkers of favorable neuroblastoma (CD44, EPHB6, EFNB2, EFNB3, NTRK1). Treatment of MYCN amplified (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5) and non-MYCN amplified (Nb69, SKNAS) neuroblastoma cells with MIBG resulted in marked reduction of MYCN and MYC expression, respectively in dose and time dependent fashions. Collectively, our studies suggest that MIBG not only targets neural crest derived tumors, but also is a MYCN/MYC destabilizing agent.']",

        "Background":"['We have been interested in identifying MYCN/MYC destabilizers that can specifically target neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, melanoma, and malignant pheochromocytoma). MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Non-MYCN amplified neuroblastomas express high-levels of MYC, and prognosis of these neuroblastomas is very poor. Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are also known for high MYC expression. Interestingly, these neural crest derived tumors characteristically express the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This feature can be used to specifically target the tumor cells with agonists of NET, such as Meta-Iodo-BenzylGuanidine (MIBG). In the previous AACR meeting, we presented our finding that non-radio-labeled MIBG can suppress growth of neuroblastoma cells in vitro, and this effect is in part related to its ability to destabilize MYC and MYCN. We have also shown that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. Recently, it has been reported that Phenformin, a Type II diabetic drug, binds NET, suggesting that NET positive cells preferentially uptake Phenformin. It is also known that Phenformin inhibits the mitochondrial electron transfer system. In this study, we have investigated a possible effect of Phenformin on growth and MYC/MYCN stability in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. SKNBE(2)C and CHP134 neuroblastoma cell lines were treated with various doses (0-2.5mM) of Phenformin for two days. MTS assay was used to assess the effect of Phenformin on growth of the cells. There was a dose-dependent growth suppression of the NB cell lines tested. Phenformin was more effective against growth of SKNBE(2)C than CHP134 cells. The effect of Phenformin on MYC/MYCN expression in four neuroblastoma cell lines [SKNBE(2)C, CHP134, SKNAS, and SY5Y] was also examined by Western blot assay. SKNBE(2)C and CHP134 express MYCN, whereas SKNAS and SY5Y express MYC at high levels. Treatment of these cells with Phenformin at the dose of 1mM for 24 hours resulted in destabilization of MYCN/MYC, suggesting that the growth suppressive effect of Phenformin on neuroblastoma cells was in part due to reduction in MYC/MYCN expression. We are currently examining whether the above observations made in neuroblastoma are also applicable to other neural crest derived tumors. In addition, we are investigating how Phenformin-related mitochondrial dysfunction causes destabilization of MYC/MYCN in neuroblastoma cells.']",

Based on the published literature, these tumor characteristics were then associated with potential benefit or no benefit to the specific therapeutic agents.  All relevant published studies were evaluated using the USPSTF grading scheme for study design and validity.

Results', '  All common malignancies (10 most common cancer types in men and women) and 10 rare cancer types were well represented (minimum of 100 cases in each individual cancer type). Well established driver mutations and protein expression in common cancers were all identified with expected frequencies (e.g. HER2 amplification in breast, PIK3CA mutations in ER+ breast cancer, EGFR mutations in NSCLC, etc.). Importantly, unexpected new and potentially actionable targets were identified in common (e.g., 6.7% HER2 amplification in NSCLC, 1.6% KRAS mutation in prostatic adenocarcinoma) and rare cancers (e.g., 8.3% ALK alteration in soft tissue sarcomas, 10.5% c-MET and 26.4% EGFR gene amplification in melanomas, 16.3% KRAS mutation in cholangiocarcinomas, 10% AR expression in STS), as well in cancers of unknown primary site (approximately 4% of all tested cases).  Conclusions', '  This review of the large referral cancer profiling database provided an unparalleled insight in the distribution of common and rare genetic and protein alterations with direct and potential treatment implications.

        "Meeting_name":" Elevated expression of Fn14 in non-small cell lung cancer correlates with c-MET and promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",
        "Background":"['Tumor invasiveness and therapeutic resistance strongly contribute to the low (<10%) five-year survival rate for advanced stage lung cancer; thus, identification of novel interventions targeting metastasis and therapeutic resistance is a necessity. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) are two cell surface receptors known to be associated with lung cancer invasiveness and cell survival. Our lab recently demonstrated that Fn14 was over-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlated with activated epidermal growth factor receptor, and that expression of Fn14 modulated NSCLC cell invasiveness and metastasis. We hypothesize that elevated Fn14 expression can be maintained by c-Met activation, and that blockade of Fn14 can suppress NSCLC invasiveness driven by c-Met. Here we demonstrate that Fn14 protein expression significantly correlated with c-Met expression in primary NSCLC patient tumors. Fn14 and c-Met were more highly expressed in metastatic tumors compared to patient-matched primary NSCLC tumors, suggesting a role in the metastatic phenotype. To further elucidate the relationship between Fn14 and c-Met in NSCLC invasiveness, we employed two cell lines derived from a primary tumor (H2073) and metastatic lymph node (H1993) of the same patient. H1993 cells (c-Met receptor amplification) expressed significantly elevated protein levels of Fn14 compared to H2073 (low c-Met), which were significantly diminished in H1993 cells upon c-Met inhibition through SU11274 treatment. Moreover, exposure of H2073 cells to HGF induced the protein expression of Fn14. The elevated expression of Fn14 through HGF stimulation (H2073) or c-Met receptor amplification (H1993) was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with U0126, a potent MEK inhibitor, suggesting that c-Met-induced Fn14 expression may depend on MAPK signaling. To further elucidate the effect of Fn14 on global c-Met-induced expression, genome-wide expression analysis was employed to determine genes both over-expressed in H1993 compared to H2073 and subsequently suppressed in Fn14 depleted H1993 cells. RALGPS2, a gene over-expressed in lung tumors that induces of c-fos and OPRL1, a gene elevated in metastatic melanoma, were elevated in the metastatic cell line and subsequently suppressed with Fn14 depletion. In addition, shRNA-mediated depletion of Fn14 in H1993 cells attenuated cell migration and invasion by 45% and 40%, respectively. This work demonstrates that c-Met and Fn14 may play a critical role in NSCLC metastasis, and suggests that targeting Fn14 may impact c-Met-driven NSCLC invasiveness. Successful targeting of NSCLC invasiveness would have significant clinical impact on a disease that is deadly in its advanced stages.']",

        "Background":"['Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with various molecular lesions and drug response profiles within the same tumor type. Patient stratification in clinical trials based on molecular features has contributed to recent success of several targeted cancer drugs on molecular aberrations such as BCR-ABL translocation in CML, Her2 amplification in breast and gastric cancers, EGFR mutations and ALK fusions in lung cancer and BRAF mutation in melanoma. However, in most cancers, the molecular features which can be used for patient stratification are not as simple as a single genetic aberration. Multiple drug resistance mechanisms caused by various mutations in cancer signaling pathways can also increase the uncertainty of clinical outcomes.To increase the chance of success in human clinical studies, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) clinical trials (PCTs) have increasingly been used for predictive biomarker validation, resistance mechanism investigation and combination therapy selection. PDX tumor models have been demonstrated to have high correlations with human patients in tumor pathology, molecular characteristics and drug responses. Large scale PCTs have also shown consistency in results when compared to related human clinical trials.At GenenDesign, we have established over 1000 PDX tumor models and more than 100 resistance models against various cancer drugs. Many of these PDX models have been characterized at RNA/Exome sequence, gene expression, gene copy number and hot-spot mutation levels. We carried out our PDX clinical trials by testing multiple approved drugs and clinical drug candidates such as targeted inhibitors against FGFRs, c-Met/ALK, HER2, EGFR, cell cycle regulators, Ras/Raf pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, as well as chemotherapy drugs in biomarker-driven multi-drug multi-arm expanded PDX clinical trials. So far, we have accumulated more than 3000 efficacy data sets and associated PD samples.Analysis of drug response and associated genomic information from PDX clinical trials yielded rich information for predictive biomarker identification and validation. At the same time, many potential resistance mechanisms were also revealed. These information can make human clinical trial better prepared, more efficient and focused.
