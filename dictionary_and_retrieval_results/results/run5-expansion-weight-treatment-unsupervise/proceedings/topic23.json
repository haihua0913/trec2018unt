        "Background":"['IntroductionInactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor, a negative regulator of oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling, occurs in a subset of melanomas and is correlated with disease progression, treatment resistance and reduced patient survival. PTEN loss of function in melanoma is thought to result largely from gene deletion, mutation and/or methylation. However, the low frequency of these genomic alterations cannot explain the higher rate of loss of PTEN protein expression that is observed in melanoma. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that loss of PTEN expression in melanoma might be the consequence of predominantly non-genomic mechanisms, including post-transcriptional and post-translational dysregulation. Specifically, we postulated that PTEN loss in some melanomas might result from aberrant expression of PTENP1, a PTEN pseudogene-derived long non-coding RNA, and from increased PTEN ubiquitination and hence protein degradation.Experimental ProceduresWe performed an integrated analysis of data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 276) and metastatic melanoma human specimens from patients enrolled at NYU (n = 48). We examined the frequency of PTEN copy number loss using genomic qPCR, PTEN mutations using targeted sequencing and qPCR mutation arrays, and PTEN methylation status was determined in tumors lacking PTEN deletion or mutation with bisulfite treatment and pyrosequencing. Furthermore, we assessed PTEN and PTENP1 expression in tumor samples by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.ResultsComplete PTEN deletions were found in 8% of TCGA cases and in 10% of NYU cases, while partial PTEN deletions were detected in 27% of NYU cases. Somatic PTEN mutations were found in 8% of TCGA cases and 3% of NYU cases. The frequency of PTEN methylation at five CpG islands ranged between 0% and 28% and did not predict PTEN protein expression, thus identifying a subset of tumors that exhibit PTEN protein loss despite a lack of detectable PTEN deletions, mutations or methylation. Integration of PTEN and PTENP1 expression data from TCGA and the NYU cohort revealed a strong positive correlation between PTEN and PTENP1 levels in melanoma. Analysis of a role for aberrant PTEN ubiquitination in promoting PTEN loss in melanoma is ongoing.ConclusionsOur data challenge the existing model in which PTEN loss in melanoma is thought to occur primarily as a result of gene deletion, mutation or methylation. Rather, we find that these are uncommon events in melanoma and that PTEN loss may instead be attributed to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms, such as dysregulation by loss of the PTENP1 long non-coding RNA. A comprehensive understanding of these non-genomic processes could identify novel approaches (PTEN-restoring therapy) to block tumor progression and improve treatment responses and patient survival, suggesting that suppression of PTEN levels in melanoma might be reversible and thus could be exploited clinically.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' PTEN is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the PI3K signaling pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3, converting it to PIP2. PTEN loss of function results in activation of Akt and downstream signaling pathways, and has been associated with numerous cancers, most commonly endometrial cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma and prostate cancer. PTEN loss can be a result of multiple different aberrations which include mutations in the coding region leading to frame-shift or stop codons, genomic deletions as well as promoter methylation leading to loss of PTEN protein. Determination of PTEN status, both at the DNA and protein levels, may be important for clinical decision-making because loss of PTEN is associated with resistance to various targeted therapies, while inactivating mutations may confer sensitivity to therapeutics targeting PI3K pathway members. We have developed Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) assays to assess PTEN mutation status in a set of FFPE patient specimens.Methods', ' Our Sanger sequencing assay for PTEN was developed to detect known hotspot mutations in exons 5-8, which occur in the majority of PTEN mutations reported in the COSMIC database. The IHC and CISH assays were developed using commercially available reagents. All assays were validated using a combination of plasmids, cell lines and FFPE tissues for specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility and concordance.Results', ' 22 patient FFPE tissue specimens from a variety of tumor types including colon, lung, pancreas, uterus and prostate were evaluated for PTEN mutation and expression status by both Sanger sequencing and IHC methods. Sequencing results were', ' 9 wild-type, 12 heterozygous mutant, and 1 hemizygous mutant. 7 of the 9 specimens reported as wild-type by sequencing exhibited normal protein expression levels by IHC, while 2 were PTEN negative by IHC, suggesting that mechanisms other than mutations in exons 5-8 contributed to the loss of expression of PTEN protein. These 2 specimens were further analyzed by CISH to determine copy number. Of the 13 specimens reported as mutant by sequencing, IHC protein expression results indicated that 6 were PTEN positive and 7 were PTEN negative, underscoring the observation that exon 5-8 mutation status alone is not sufficient to predict PTEN expression levels. Data on CISH analysis of the specimen that was hemizygous mutant by sequencing will be reported to confirm the copy loss.Conclusion', ' The data suggest that additional mutations outside the exon 5-8 region as well as promoter methylation may result in loss of PTEN protein, and that accurate clinical assessment of PTEN mutation and protein expression status in FFPE tissues requires complimentary methods including Sanger sequencing, IHC and CISH methodologies.']",

Methods', ' A 49 yo woman with ULMS developed rapidly progressive metastatic disease 4 months after R1-resection of the primary tumor and was enrolled on a phase 1b study of pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 wks) (KEYNOTE-028). Tumor regression at multiple metastatic sites occurred within 2 months. A single pre-existing metastasis increased in size and was resected at 9 months. IHC, whole exome/transcriptome sequencing, and neoantigen analysis was performed on primary pretreatment (preRx) and treatment-resistant tumors (postRx). Results', ' Responsive tumor sites revealed complete pathologic response at time of surgery. Progressive tumor demonstrated viable ULMS. IHC showed tumor cells negative for PD-L1 and positive for PD-L2 both preRx and postRx. Degree of PD-1+ lymphocyte infiltration decreased significantly postRx compared to preRx. PreRx harbored exomic focal MYC amplification, TP53 nonsense mutation, and heterozygous PTEN deletion. PostRx maintained these genomic alterations and acquired a loss-of-function mutation in PTEN that resulted in biallelic PTEN inactivation. PreRx tumor expressed tumor-specific neoantigens (TSNs) that were immunogenic to patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells; expression of TSNs decreased postRx. Conclusions', ' This patient exhibited complete pathologic response to pembrolizumab at all but one metastatic ULMS site. Genomic analysis of the resistant tumor revealed acquired bialllelic PTEN loss - recently implicated in resistance to PD-1 inhibition in melanoma and glioblastoma  reduced infiltration of PD-1+ lymphocytes, and diminished expression of neoantigens. To our knowledge, this is the first report of exceptional response to PD-1 inhibition in ULMS, and highlights biallelic PTEN loss and neoantigen downregulation as potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade across cancer types.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Visualization of endogenous melanoma initiation and progression using intravital microscopy",
        "Background":"['The death rates for malignant metastatic melanoma continue to rise because melanoma is largely refractory to existing therapies. Loss or inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog on Chromosome Ten) is observed in 40-50% of melanoma, and BRAF and PTEN mutations exist coincidentally in approximately 20% of melanoma cases. In mouse GEMM models, these mutations cooperate to promote metastatic melanomagenesis. However, existing methods to activate these lesions with Tyr-CreERT2 and topical tamoxifen application yields multifocal primary tumors whose origins cannot be accurately determined. To improve this model, we combined a tdTomatoLSL allele that serves as a visual marker of Cre recombination with Tyr-CreERT2;BrafCA;Ptenlox/lox to produce an animal where we can reproducibly initiate tumorigenesis in a spatiotemporally controllable manner by transiently applying extremely low doses (<20 nM) of tamoxifen to the dermis of the ear. Due to melanocyte-specific expression of the fluorescent protein tdTomato, we can track tumor progression from endogenous cells using two-photon intravital imaging. Starting from a single primary tumor on the ear, we can detect distant metastases in cervical lymph nodes and lungs via macroscopic fluorescent imaging, qRT-PCR and histology. We are using this model in combination with targeted therapy to investigate the effects of selective molecular inhibitors on the growth and metastasis of endogenous BRAFV600E/PTEN-/- metastatic melanoma at the cellular level. Preliminary studies using intravital imaging and a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, GSK212 (Trametinib, FDA approved treatment for metastatic melanoma) show that targeted therapy causes heterogeneous reorganization of the tumor cells as early as 3 days post-treatment. After several weeks of continuous treatment, the remaining, resistant tumor cells are highly correlated spatially with bundled collagen structures detected by second harmonic generation signal, suggesting that cellular milieu strongly influences drug response. In addition, GSK212 treated animals still had lung macro-metastatic tumors, indicating that despite continuous MEK1/2 inhibition, metastatic tumor growth in the lung was still possible. In summary, we have developed an inducible endogenous model of melanoma metastasis that can be used to directly investigate both heterogeneous effects of targeted therapy at the cellular level and the efficacy of targeted therapy against metastasis.']",

        "Background":"['Although BRAF inhibitors display promising clinical response in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma patients, not all patients respond to these agents and the durability of the response is limited. To improve BRAF targeted therapy, we characterized a panel of BRAFV600 mutant melanoma cell lines and determined their response to cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell signaling changes by GSK2118436 alone and in combination with the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458. Nine of 11 BRAFV600E, 4/5 BRAFV600K and 1/1 BRAFV600D mutant lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 (IC50<0.3M). These sensitive lines had wild-type MEK1/2 with or without PTEN mutations. Two of the three lines insensitive to GSK2118436 had either MEK1P124S or MEK2K66_K68del mutations. GSK2118436 treatment decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and cyclin D1 in both the sensitive and insensitive lines. However, GSK2118436 decreased S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation (pS6P) only in the sensitive lines. Cell lines sensitive to GSK2118436 were also sensitive to the allosteric MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 (IC50<0.01M). The combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 had a synergistic to additive effect on cell growth inhibition in the sensitive lines, but had minimal benefit in the three insensitive lines. Although 5/6 PTEN NULL lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 based on their IC50s, growth of these lines was inhibited less effectively by GSK2118436 compared to the PTEN WT lines evaluated by IC70. PTEN NULL cells displayed higher levels of basal AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) than PTEN WT lines. Treatment of PTEN NULL lines with GSK2118436 increased pAKT while similar treatment of PTEN WT lines decreased pAKT and increased PTEN expression. In combination with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458, GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 effectively inhibited MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR signaling, enhanced cell growth inhibition, and induced apoptosis evaluated by caspase 3/7 activation and/or PARP cleavage in both PTEN WT and PTEN NULL lines. In PTEN deficient lines, these combinations were more effective than the combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212. These results indicate MEK1/2 mutations associate with lack of sensitivity to single agent BRAF and MEK inhibitors. In addition, PTEN deficiency may reduce the effectiveness of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. The combination of GSK2118436 with GSK1120212 or GSK2126458 may improve the effectiveness of BRAF targeted therapy in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma. Our results support the testing of GSK2118436 with these combinations in the clinic and warrant further investigation of MEK and PTEN mutation status and pS6P as a pharmacodynamic marker to improve treatment outcome in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['T cell-mediated immunotherapies are promising cancer treatments. However, most patients still fail to respond to these therapies. The molecular determinants of immune resistance are poorly understood. Here, we interrogated the role of loss of expression of the tumor suppressor, PTEN, in immune resistance.In preclinical studies, we found that silencing PTEN in tumor cells inhibited T cell-mediated tumor killing and decreased T cell trafficking into tumors. In clinical studies, we observed that tumors with loss of PTEN had significantly less CD8+ T cell infiltration than PTEN-present tumors. In addition, 26% of melanomas that did not yield successful TIL growth demonstrated PTEN loss, which was more frequent than was observed in tumors that yielded successful TIL growth (11%). We further validated the association between reduced number and impaired function of TIL with PTEN loss using another independent cohort, TCGA dataset for SKCM. More importantly, we analyzed clinical outcomes of metastatic melanoma patients treated with the FDA-approved anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our analysis demonstrates that a greater reduction in tumor burden was achieved by PD-1 blockade in PTEN present patients, when compared with PTEN absent patients.To decipher the factors mediating the immunosuppressive effects of PTEN loss, we determined the expression profiles of tumor cells with or without PTEN expression. Our results indicated that PTEN loss increased the production of immunosuppressive factors, including CCL2 and VEGF. Anti-VEGF blocking antibody improved anti-tumor activity of transferred tumor-reactive T cells and enhanced tumor infiltration of transferred T cells in PTEN-silenced tumors. These results suggest that loss of PTEN can facilitate the resistance of T cell-mediated immune responses by increasing the expression of immunosuppressive factors.Given that PTEN loss results in activation of the PI3K pathway, we evaluated the efficacy of immunotherapy in combination with a selective PI3Kinhibitor to treat spontaneously developed BRAF mutant, PTEN null melanomas in genetically engineered mouse models. Our result showed that the combination of PI3K inhibitor and anti-PD-1 significantly delayed tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Mice treated with this combination had a median survival time of 28 days, which is longer than the survival time of mice treated with either therapy. Increased numbers of T cells at tumor sites were found in mice receiving the combination therapy compared with mice receiving either agent alone.Taken together, our results demonstrate that PTEN loss contributes to the generation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Notably, this study provides the first direct clinical evidence to support the association between PTEN loss and poor clinical outcome in immunotherapy treated patients. In addition, our study indicates that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer.']",

Defining the landscape of genetic alterations that participate in cancer transformation provides insight into the diversity of clinical responses observed to targeted treatments. Here, we identified concurrent mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressors TP53 and PTEN as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanomas harboring mutant V600EBRAF.Defects in TP53 function and PTEN loss occur in 17% and 12% of malignant melanomas respectively, rendering cells dependent on CHK1 to maintain normal cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that CHK1 inhibition increases sensitivity to a variety of alkylating agents and targeted therapies in V600EBRAF mutant, TP53/PTEN deficient cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Inhibition of CHK1 concurrently with the induction of either DNA damage or replication stress leads to mitotic catastrophe and cell death in our in vitro and in vivo models of TP53/PTEN deficient tumors. In the case of externally applied cellular stress from chemotherapeutics, our results suggest CHK1 inhibition may sensitise this genetically defined subset of melanomas to such treatments.Our results provide some insight into the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes observed when treating BRAF mutant melanomas with BRAF inhibitor and suggest a need for comprehensive screening of TP53 and PTEN inactivation in these patients.']",

        "Background":"['Despite recent success of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic, nearly all of those treated follow a course in which initial tumor regression was followed by eventual relapse, which constitutes a major barrier to long-term therapeutic management of melanoma. We have identified a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance that arises from the release of TGF from melanomas that lack PTEN expression leading to the recruitment of host fibroblasts and the generation of a protective microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine fibronectin secretion facilitating therapeutic escape. Preliminary studies show that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines that lacked PTEN expression dramatically increased their secretion of TGF- following vemurafenib treatment, as detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autocrine TGF secretion initiated with vemurafinib treatment stimulated the upregulation and secretion of fibronectin in PTEN- cells. The vemurafenib-mediated ECM remodeling in this case was dependent upon autocrine TGF signaling and could be attenuated following pre-treatment with the TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB505124 or by siRNA knockdown of TGF receptor I. A mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomic screen in conjunction with innovative network modeling approaches suggested that increased integrin 51 signaling was a key adaptive response of PTEN- melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitor therapy. The importance of increased fibronectin expression and integrin 51 signaling in the therapeutic escape of PTEN- melanoma cells was confirmed by the significant increases in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis observed following siRNA knockdown of either integrin 5, 1, or fibronectin expression. A mass spectrometry screen (LC-MRM) of 18 BH3 proteins demonstrated Mcl-1 and Bak to be critical apoptosis regulators in the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance response. The importance of PTEN loss and Mcl-1 downregulation in therapeutic escape was validated in PTEN- melanoma cell lines expressing doxycycline inducible forms of PTEN, lipid phosphatase mutant PTEN and Mcl-1. Novel organotypic co-culture models were developed to demonstrate that TGF- released from PTEN- melanoma cell lines activated host fibroblasts leading to the attenuation of drug response in the tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that BRAF inhibition remodels both the melanoma and host microenvironments to provide a protective sanctuary for the minor populations of melanoma cells that escape therapy. We postulate that tumor eradication can only be achieved by a dual therapeutic strategy that targets both the bulk tumor and the microenvironment.']",

The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type.

We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas.

The Cre recombinase is fused to an estrogen receptor that inhibits the activity of the recombinase. Activation of the Cre recombinase requires topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for induction of recombination at specific time points in the life span of the mouse.

Methods', '   Vemurafenib-nave patients receive a single dose of oral BKM120 (d -7) then vemurafenib twice daily with BKM120 daily (starting on c1d1). Patients with prior progression on vemurafenib received both vemurafenib and BKM120 starting on c1d1 after a vemurafenib washout of at least 14 days. Serial biopsies prior to treatment, on cycle 1 day 15, and at progression were obtained for pharmacodynamics analysis in patients with visible or palpable tumors.   3 + 3 dose escalation was planned starting at vemurafenib 720 mg PO twice daily with BKM120 60 mg daily.  Results', '   Four BRAF inhibitor nave patients andfour BRAF inhibitor refractory patients were treated on study with vemurafenib 720 mg PO bid and BKM120 60 mg PO daily.  Two BRAF inhibitor nave patient experienced DLTs (myalgias, DRESS syndrome).  One vemurafenib nave patient was inevaluable due to non-compliance and had minimal exposure to study drug. Two of four BRAF inhibitor refractory patients experienced DLTs (myalgias, febrile neutropenia). One BRAF inhibitor-resistant patient had a mixed response to treatment with a 35.9% reduction in target lesions and two new small subcutaneous lesions.  Conclusions', '   Combination therapy with vemurafenib and BKM120 in BRAF-V600E/K mutant melanoma was not tolerated in either BRAF inhibitor nave or BRAF inhibitor resistant patients.

        "Background":"[\"Gene expression data can be used to identify the activation status of genes and pathways in tumor samples and to infer the structure of regulatory networks. Most tumor datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas focus on unperturbed samples, and subsequently, the statistical frameworks that analyze them.We hypothesized that perturbation of cells can uncover network structures that are undetectable in basal state, and reveal the complexity of cancer cells. To demonstrate this, we generated gene expression data from a panel of melanoma cell lines before and after inhibition of MEK or AKT.Here we present a new computational framework to analyze gene expression data before and after perturbations. The algorithm aims to define differential networks1 - rewiring of network components in different tumors. The algorithm sheds light on the complex and context-specific nature of network structure, including pathways that are activated, or under the control of MAPK or AKT, only in a subset of samples.The perturbation data allowed us to assess pathway activation levels that are undetectable in unperturbed state. For example, AKT is activated in melanoma by PTEN loss, but the effect of NRAS mutation on AKT is unknown, and AKT activation is undetectable in unperturbed cells. Our algorithm identified an AKT activation signature in perturbed state, and helped define the effects of PTEN and NRAS mutations on the pathway. Additionally, the algorithm inferred the genetic status of p53 in each cell line by identifying pathway activation, changes that are, once again, detectable only after perturbations.By linking protein data with the algorithm's results, we identified cell lines with constitutive activation of the STAT3 pathway, and demonstrated the crosstalk between MAPK and STAT3 pathways.Moreover, combining the results from the algorithm with known signatures of drug-sensitivity accurately predicted which drug combinations provided a synergistic effect in each cell line. Associations between pathway activity level and drug sensitivity are known for some drugs. By using our algorithm's ability to infer pathway status in different tumors and to detect changes in those pathways after drug treatment, it correctly predicted when drug treatment sensitized cells to the effects of chemotherapy and other drugs.To conclude, we show that gene expression of perturbed cells greatly enhances the power of network structure analysis. Our results reveal context-specific changes in network structure, and predict which cell lines are sensitized to specific drugs by pathway perturbations. These results have direct applicability to the development of drug combinations in melanoma.1 Pe'er and Hacohen, Cell 2011Citation Format\", \" Oren Litvin, Sarit Schwartz, Mark Rocco, Tanya Schild, Neal Rosen, Dana Pe'er.

        "Background":"['Background. Complex feedback loops and crosstalk between the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways, thus molecular predictors of sensitivity/resistance and synergistic/antagonistic interactions are urgently needed for the effective clinical development of combination strategies. Here we hypothesize that PTEN status critically modulates the growth inhibitory activity of single and combined MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition. Methods. Molecular and functional effects of single and combined MEK (trametinib, T) and mTOR (everolimus, E) blockade were assessed in a panel of 29 cancer cell lines with different molecular drivers. Pharmacologic interactions were analyzed by conservative isobologram analysis. PTEN role was mechanistically assessed by either silencing PTEN expression by shRNA or overexpressing a functional PTEN protein by stable transfection. Specific proteins and their phosphorylation states were analyzed using Kinexus Antibody Microarrays. Results. In the cell line panel analyzed, the presence of a wt-PTEN was the only significant predictor of sensitivity to T (p=0.001), while BRAF mutations were significantly related to E resistance (p=0.015). PTEN silencing slightly increased resistance to T in the wt-PTEN melanoma cell line M14; conversely, wt-PTEN overexpression in the PTEN-del WM115 cell line, dramatically increased sensitivity to T. E-induced growth inhibition was not significantly affected. Combined MEK and mTOR inhibition resulted in a striking growth inhibitory synergism in cells lacking PTEN expression (CI', ' 0.4-0.0005), but not in those with an intact PTEN (CI', ' 1.2-107; p=0.001). However, PTEN silencing restored growth inhibitory synergism of combined T and E in M14 cells (CI', '0.36); similarly, the slope of the CI/fraction affected curve was dramatically altered in PTEN-overexpressing WM115 cells, as compared to their control-transfected counterpart, again indicating that PTEN expression/function causally influences functional response to combined MEK and mTOR inhibition. Similar results in terms of synergistic/antagonistic pharmacologic interactions were obtained when either double PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors (PF-5212384) or AKT allosteric inhibitors (MK-2206) were used to block the PI3K/mTOR pathway in combination with T. Proteomic analysis indicated that a greater modification of protein expression/phosphorylation profiles in response to MEK or combined MEK/mTOR inhibition occurs in cells lacking a functional PTEN, as compared to the wt-PTEN-expressing ones; preliminary analysis suggests that AKT phosphorylation and NF-B activation maybe be crucial mediators of synergistic growth-inhibitory interactions occurring with combined treatment. Conclusions. PTEN loss may constitute a suitable genetic/molecular marker of synergistic activity interactions between MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Targeted cancer therapies that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific onco-proteins are limited by signaling mechanisms that drive intrinsic and acquired resistance. In particular, the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways have been found to both reduce response rates to these agents and to mediate the acquisition of resistance via mutations that activate both pathways. For example, two recently approved BRAFV600E inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, cause dramatic clinical responses in 50% of BRAFV600E + melanoma patients but universally become ineffective within 5-6 months as a result of genetic alterations that activate the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, including amplifications in BRAFV600E, loss of PTEN, and activating mutations in NRAS and KRAS, MEK, AKT1/3, PIK3CA and PIK3CG. Several of these mutated signaling proteins stimulate glucose metabolism, required for survival and proliferation, in part by increasing the expression and activity of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFKFB3). For example, PFKFB3 transcription is induced by HIF-1 (which is increased by BRAFV600E, RAS and MEK), loss of PTEN, and PFKFB3 activity is stimulated by AKT via phosphorylation of serine 461. We postulated that PFKFB3 is an essential downstream target of targeted cancer therapies and that the multitude of mutations and amplifications in signaling pathways that cause resistance to these agents activate PFKFB3. In new studies, we demonstrate that BRAFV600E, estradiol and epidermal growth factor each regulate PFKFB3 expression in melanoma cells, breast cancer cells and NSCLC cells, respectively. Moreover, we find that simultaneous inhibition of these oncoproteins or their co-ligands (i.e. the estrogen and EGF receptors) and PFKFB3 using a novel PFKFB3 inhibitor currently in a phase 1 trial, PFK-158, causes a synergistic increase in apoptosis and cytotoxicity in vitro, suggesting that PFK-158 can overcome the intrinsic resistance to these agents. We then decided to determine if these significant synergies would translate in vivo by investigating them in the A375 and A2058 melanoma preclinical models, and in the MCF-7 ER-dependent breast model. For instance, we compared the anti-tumor effects in A375 melanoma xenograft-bearing mice of', ' (i) the BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib; (ii) PFK-158; or (iii) the combination of vemurafenib and PFK-158. Although we observed significant tumor growth inhibition with both monotherapies (>80%), we only observed tumor regression with the combination therapy (>50%). Results in these different models will be presented. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PFKFB3 inhibitor PFK-158 may be able to universally overcome resistance to targeted cancer therapies. Furthermore, we predict that phase 1/2 trials of PFK-158 in combination with targeted cancer agents will yield improvements in objective response rates as well as improvements in progression-free survival.']",

        "Background":"['Metastasis is the number one cause of cancer-related mortality. Major neoplastic diseases such as melanoma, lung, breast, and colon cancers have high incidences of brain metastases. One-year survival after diagnosis of brain metastasis is less than 20%. Cancer cells dynamically interacts with specific organ microenvironments to establish metastasis as depicted by the seed and soil hypothesis. Yet it is unclear when and how disseminated tumor cells acquire the essential traits from the brain microenvironment that primes their subsequent metastatic outgrowth.Here we found that primary tumor cells with normal PTEN expression lose PTEN after dissemination to the brain, but not to other organs. Metastatic brain tumor cells that have experienced PTEN loss have PTEN levels restored once they leave the brain. This brain microenvironment-dependent, reversible PTEN mRNA and protein down-regulation is epigenetically regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) from astrocyte-derived exosomes. Furthermore, this adaptive PTEN loss in brain metastatic tumor cells leads to an increased secretion of cytokine chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), which recruits Iba1+ myeloid cells that reciprocally enhance outgrowth of brain metastatic tumor cells via enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis.Our findings signify the dynamic and reciprocal cross-talk between tumor cells and other brain stromal cells. Disseminated tumor cells acquire the essential traits from the microenvironment of brain that prime their outgrowth.

In the current study, we evaluated the pharmacological activity of BI847325, a dual inhibitor of MEK and Aurora kinases against multiple melanoma cell line models.METHODS', ' The cytotoxic effect of BI847325 was evaluated in vitro in a panel of selected BRAF-mutant vemurafenib resistant cell lines by Alamar blue and Annexin V binding assay. 3D spheroid model systems and colony formation assays demonstrated the long-term growth inhibitory effect of BI847325. Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR studies were carried out to evaluate the mechanism underlying BI5-mediated cytotoxicity. In vivo studies in Balb SCID mice were performed to assess the suppression of BRAF-mutant xenografts on treatment with BI847325.RESULTS', ' BI847325 potently reduced the growth and survival of BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines with acquired and intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance (NRAS mutations, BRAF splice forms, Cyclin D1 amplification, RTK upregulation, PTEN loss, COT amplification). We confirmed that BI847325 induced apoptosis through decrease in Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression and increase in BIM expression. The effects of BI847325 upon BIM and Mcl-1 expression could not be mimicked by the combination of other MEK and aurora kinase inhibitors. For the first time we demonstrated that BI847325 reverses the acquired vemurafenib resistance by inhibiting MEK expression at mRNA and protein level. A strong suppression of MEK expression was observed without recovery following 72 h of washout. In vivo studies revealed complete tumor suppression with no recurrence over a period of 65 days of treatment with 70mg/kg/week dose of BI847325. In contrast, treatment with vemurafenib analog PLX4720 in the same mouse model was associated with tumor relapse after 30 days of treatment. BI847325 also successfully suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired vemurafenib resistance. Analysis of tumor samples complied with in vitro results demonstrating inhibition of phospho-ERK, phospho-Histone3, Mcl-1 and total MEK.CONCLUSION', ' In conclusion we report for the first time that BI847325, a novel ATP-competitive MEK/ Aurora kinase inhibitor effectively inhibits BRAF-mutant melanoma and overcomes vemurafenib-resistance by decreasing expression of MEK and Mcl-1; in vitro and in vivo.

        "Background":"['Acquired drug resistance is a long-standing problem of cancer therapeutics. The issue has become even more vexing with the development of highly selective agents; resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib is acquired frequently in lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, anticipating acquired resistance and understanding its basis may help us develop strategies to prevent or circumvent occurrence. Through its receptor tyrosine kinase Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis during development and adulthood. HGF/Met signaling also contributes to cancer progression in many malignancies, including glioblastoma. Rilotumumab is a fully human neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HGF tested in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, including mono therapy in renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, as well as combination trials in gastric, colorectal, small cell lung cancers and castrate resistant prostate cancer.To generate a cellular model of acquired resistance to rilotumumab, an HGF/Met dependent human glioblastoma-derived cell line (U87-MG) was grown in rilotumumab (600 nM) for 120 days. Growth rate, HGF secretion, Met content and Met activation state were 10-fold, 10,000-fold, 10-fold and 80-fold higher than the parental cell values, respectively. The HGF and MET coding sequences were normal in both parental and resistant cells. Quantitative PCR studies to determine mRNA levels of all HGF isoforms revealed a dramatic increase in full-length HGF transcript. CGH array studies indicated amplification within both HGF and MET genes. Xenograft studies confirmed that tumor growth was resistant to rilotumumab, however the resistant cell line and tumors remained sensitive to a highly selective Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that resistance was achieved via increased HGF/Met signaling rather than mutation or activation of alternate pathways. Microarray expression analysis demonstrated transcript profiles that were consistent with HGF/Met pathway activation. Thus the molecular basis of acquired resistance in this model differs from those prevalent in', ' [1] lung cancers treated with EGFR inhibitors and medulloblastomas treated with hedgehog inhibitors, where most cases acquire secondary mutations in the targeted kinase; [2] breast cancers treated with HER2 inhibitors, where PTEN loss, p27 downregulation, and activation of other receptors are primary causes; or [3] malignant melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors, where increased signaling via multiple pathways lead to PI3K- and/or MEK-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway. In addition to the importance of HGF/Met pathway activity in selecting glioblastoma patients for HGF-targeted therapeutics, our results suggest that monitoring Met pathway activity could provide early indications of acquired resistance to these agents, and that Met kinase inhibitors may still be efficacious when resistance occurs.']",
