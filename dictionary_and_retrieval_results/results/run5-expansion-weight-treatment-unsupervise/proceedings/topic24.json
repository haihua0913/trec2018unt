        "Meeting_name":" Inhibition of melanoma cell survival through p62/LC3B autophagic signaling",
        "Background":"['The primary objectives of this study were i) systematic evaluation of the differences in basal autophagic activity between melanocytes and malignant melanoma cells to determine whether these differences may be selectively targeted using the ROS inducer, Nexrutine (NX); ii) determination of NX selectivity in inhibiting melanoma cell survival and iii) specific involvement of autophagy signaling protein, SQSTM1/p62 in NX-mediated autophagic cell survival. NX is obtained from the bark of the cork tree, Phellodendron amurense. A panel of melanocyte and melanoma cells was evaluated for basal autophagy level and effect of NX treatment, including protein levels and turnover of p62 and LC3B (+/- CQ), and number of autophagic puncta per cell. Trypan blue, MTT, and Annexin V-APC were used to evaluate the effect of NX on cell death, proliferation and apoptosis. Genetic approach using siRNA for p62 and overexpression using HA-p62 followed by survival, proliferation, and autophagy measurements were used to further evaluate the possibility of p62 as a molecular target for inhibition of autophagy seen using NX. We found that i) melanoma cells displayed high autophagic flux compared with melanocytes, ii) NX treatment a) inhibited autophagy in melanoma cells, b) inhibited melanoma cell survival, and c) induced apoptosis in melanoma cells, iii) knockdown of p62 resulted in a lesser inhibition of cell viability and autophagy after NX treatment in high p62-expressing melanoma cells, and iv) overexpression of p62 sensitized low p62-expressing normal melanocytes and melanoma cells to NX-mediated cell death and autophagy inhibition, suggesting that p62 is a bonafide molecular target of NX. Overall, we show that Nexrutine is able to inhibit the inherent high level of pro-survival autophagy in melanoma cells, leading to loss of cell viability and induction of apoptosis, while melanocytes remain unaffected by NX at the same doses. Further, SQSTM1/p62 was found to be a critical mediator of the NX-mediated inhibition of autophagy and cell viability. This study demonstrates that NX maybe a promising novel, non-toxic agent for melanoma.Supported by R21 CA125719 & ACRCF (RG); NIDCR T32 DE14318/COSTAR (HGH)']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' While checkpoint blockade has shown promising survival benefits in patients with solid tumors, immune escape through loss of MHCI expression juxtaposed to an immunoregulatory milieu remain significant hurdles. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel treatment platform, which leverages the use of commercially available and clinically translatable nanoparticles (NPs) that can be combined with tumor-derived RNA to activate systemic immunity and re-program the intratumoral microenvironment from a regulatory into an immune activated locale. Methods', ' Since local vaccination strategies are mired with poor immunogenicity, we assessed if i.v. delivery of tumor-derived RNA encapsulated in lipophilic NPs could activate peripheral and intratumoral antigen presenting cells (APCs) for induction of therapeutic anti-tumor immunity in pre-clinical murine melanoma models. Results', ' We identified a clinically translatable NP formulation that when administered intravenously, mediates release of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. CCL2, IFN-alpha) into serum, systemically activates host APCs in reticuloendothelial organs, and induces precipitous upregulation of MHCI and immune activation markers (i.e. CD86) within the tumor microenvironment. Both model-antigen encoding RNA and physiologically-relevant tumor-derived RNA, when encapsulated in NPs, could expand potent anti-tumor T-cell immunity. We demonstrated that RNA-NPs harness the anti-viral defense mechanism against tumor antigens in a type I interferon dependent manner, and can be further engineered to deliver combinatorial therapies by co-encapsulating mRNAs encoding for immunomodulatory molecules (i.e. HCV PAMPs, GM-CSF). In a pre-clinical melanoma model, RNA-NPs mediate anti-tumor efficacy and significantly enhance activity of immune checkpoint mAbs when used in combination. Conclusions', ' By employing a systemic RNA-NP formulation encoding for both tumor RNAs and immunomodulatory molecules, as an innovative and versatile platform for delivering combinatorial therapeutics via a single treatment modality, this platform can be harnessed to simultaneously target tumor antigens and re-program the intratumoral microenvironment']",
