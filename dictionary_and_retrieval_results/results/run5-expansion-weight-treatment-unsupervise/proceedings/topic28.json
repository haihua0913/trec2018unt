Methods', '  To evaluate the role of ALK mutations in neuroblastoma progression or relapse, we searched for ALK mutations in a large series of 54 paired diagnosticrelapse neuroblastoma samples using Sanger sequencing. When an ALK mutation was observed in one sample, deep sequencing was used to seek for a minor mutated component in the other sample. With a coverage of > 100,000, the background variability was 0.034% per base at each position, resulting in a sensitivity to detect low frequency mutations in 0.15%.  Results', '  Among the paired samples, all 9 ALK-mutated cases at diagnosis demonstrated the same mutation at relapse by Sanger sequencing. Nevertheless, in one case, the mutation was detected in only one of several nodules at relapse. In contrast, in 5 cases, the mutation appeared relapse-specific. Among these, 4 cases could be further investigated by deep sequencing. In two cases no evidence of the mutation was observed at diagnosis. In one case, the mutation occurring at relapse could be identified at a sub-clonal level at diagnosis, whereas in another case, two different mutations resulting in identical amino acid changes could be detected at diagnosis and relapse. Further evidence of clonal evolution of ALK-mutated cells was provided by the observation of a minor ALK-mutated cell population in a tumour from which a cell line with ALK mutation in all cells was derived.    Conclusions', '   These results indicate that, in neuroblastoma, ALK mutations newly detected at the time of relapse can be present in a subclone at the time of diagnosis with subsequent clonal expansion at relapse. With the advent of targeted therapy using ALK inhibitors, precise knowledge of the ALK status is mandatory. Our observation of a significant spatio-temporal variation of ALK mutations is of utmost importance in clinical practice, highlighting the potential of NGS and the importance of serial samplings for therapeutic decisions.']",

In mutant and wild-type ALK cell lines there was moderate to strong synergy with combination indices of 0.2 - 0.8 at clinically relevant high effect sizes with the fraction of cells affected  0.8. Compared to either drug alone, combination LEE011 and LDK378 increased dose dependent abrogation of pALK and pRb, inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis and decreased cell viability. LDK378 did not show significant cellular accumulation after P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 inhibition or after LEE011 1uM and 10uM. LEE011 showed only modest accumulation with MRP2 inhibition, but not after BCRP or P-gp inhibition.

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma is the most common non-CNS tumor in children. High-risk disease has a dire prognosis and new treatment strategies are need. The identification of unique cell-surface proteins expressed on tumor cells, yet not expressed on normal tissues, has been challenging for pediatric malignancies. However, identification of such antigens allows for the development of new immune-based therapies featuring Ig-like binding motifs. The cell surface tyrosine kinase ALK (CD246, anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a promising target for neuroblastoma in that it is expressed in either native, mutated, or over-expressed forms on the plasma membrane surface of the tumor cell and may contribute to disease progression or severity. We identified antibodies that bind to extracellular domains of ALK, sequenced their variable regions, and used this sequence information to construct chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Primary human T lymphocytes were then transduced with retroviral gene vectors expressing a series of ALK-specific CAR. We tested CARs that incorporated both different structural and signaling motifs. Transduced T cells demonstrated ALK-specific cytolytic activity against ALK-expressing tumors and produced Th1 cytokines upon culture in the presence of tumor. In exploring different iterations of CAR domain structure we found that the scFv domains created from the heavy and light variable domains of ALK-specific immunoglobulin could be interchanged with respect to their orientation in the context of CAR tertiary protein structure. Moreover, ALK-specific scFv functioned whether expressed in a short format, that is as a single domain proximal to the T cell membrane, or in a long format, that is extended away from the plasma membrane using an IgG1-derived spacer domain composed of CH2 and CH3. Using a xenogeneic NSG mouse model for neuroblastoma, human ALK-specific CAR-expressing T cells were found to eradicate ALK-positive tumor, when IL-7 was included to support T cell persistence. These data argue for the continued evaluation of ALK-specific CARs in pre-clinical studies.']",

        "Background":"['Activated ALK by mutation or amplification is a validated therapeutic target in a subset of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being developed to abrogate ALK signaling (Bresler et al, 2014). Native ALK is expressed on the surface of the majority of neuroblastoma tumors, but not on normal tissue, giving it properties of a tumor antigen. We hypothesized that ALK-targeted antibodies may be useful in neuroblastoma as single-agent immunotherapy or in combination with small-molecule ALK inhibitors - especially where mutations reduce kinase inhibitor sensitivity. In this work, an anti-ALK monoclonal antibody (anti-ALK2) was conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (ALK2-ADC) and its anti-tumor activity was investigated in a panel of extensively characterized human neuroblastoma cell lines (n = 10) harboring wild type and mutant ALK. Cell surface ALK was quantified using flow cytometry and revealed differential antigen expression. Using in vitro growth inhibition assays, there was evidence for a dose-dependent cytotoxicity to neuroblastoma cells at subnanomolar concentrations that correlated with ALK expression and was independent of underlying mutation status. In order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ALK2-ADC in vivo, mice bearing Felix-patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, containing the third most common ALK mutation (R1245C), were used to demonstrate that ALK2-ADC led to a significant reduction in tumor growth compared to unconjugated antibody and a control ADC (p<0.0001). Although ALK2-ADC binds potently to mouse ALK as well as human ALK, doses of up to 10 mg/kg in the rodent model appeared to be well tolerated with no overt toxicity noted. Additional in vivo studies are ongoing to assess the antitumor potential of the ADC in a broader range of ALK-expressing neuroblastoma models. Thus, targeting human ALK-expressing with an ALK antibody-drug conjugate demonstrated early signs of favorable efficacy and tolerability supporting future development of this approach as a potential novel therapeutic for patients with neuroblastoma.']",

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma is the most common cancer in infancy, accounting for 15% of all childhood cancer-related death. MYCN amplification is the major genetic aberration in high-risk neuroblastoma and is associated with poor outcome. Genome-wide association studies have identified activation mutations and high-level amplification of ALK in approximately 10% of neuroblastoma patients. In addition, ALK mutations can coexist with MYCN amplification, which defines a subset of ultra-high-risk neuroblastoma patients. In contrast to the high frequency of p53 mutations observed in many human cancers of adults, mutations of p53 are less common in childhood cancers and have been reported in less than 2% of neuroblastomas. Wild-type (WT) p53 is required for the activation of p53 signaling by Mdm2 inhibitors. This suggests that neuroblastoma could be amenable to intervention with Mdm2 inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrated that the ALK inhibitor, NVP-LDK378, in combination with a novel Mdm2 inhibitor, NVP-CGM097, promoted apoptosis in ALK mutant and p53 WT neuroblastoma cell lines. NVP-LDK378 inhibited ALK phosphorylation and NVP-CGM097 caused induction of p53 and its downstream target genes in these cell lines. Meanwhile, Mdm2 inhibition in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines significantly decreased the levels of Mycn protein. In addition, NVP-LDK378 and NVP-CGM097 combination resulted in complete tumor regression and markedly prolonged survival in neuroblastoma xenograft models.

        "Background":"[\"Neuroblastomas (NBs) harboring activating point mutations in the kinase domain of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are differentially sensitive to ALK inhibition by crizotinib (Bresler et al. 2011). The F1174L and F1245C amino acid substitutions, which comprise 38.5% (mycancergenome.org) of ALK aberrations in NB, also confer intrinsic resistance to crizotinib and present a significant obstacle in the clinic. Therefore, our goal has been to identify a next-generation ALK inhibitor with improved selectivity and potency to target these resistant mutants effectively. We demonstrate here that PF-06463922 (Pfizer), an ATP-competitive, macrocyclic ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, overcomes crizotinib resistance of these ALK variants in NB, and exerts unprecedented activity as a single agent against the F1174L and F1245C ALK-mutated tumors. At a tenfold lower dose (10 mg/kg) than typically used for crizotinib (100 mg/kg), PF-06463922 induces complete tumor regression in patient-derived (COG-N-426x, F1245C ALK-mutated) and cell line-derived (SY5Y, F1174L ALK-mutated) xenograft mouse models. Whereas crizotinib-treated mice in both models experience rapid tumor growth on therapy, PF-06463922-treated mice showed sustained complete responses for several weeks even after treatment was discontinued. Cell-based and biochemical analyses indicate that the superior activity of PF-06463922 is a function of both higher potency and a broader spectrum of effectiveness across mutants. ATP levels were measured in ten NB cell lines upon treatment with PF-06463922 and crizotinib; at 120 hours post-treatment, PF-06463922 is 26-38 times more effective at inducing growth inhibition in cells with primary resistance than crizotinib. These in vitro and in vivo results are corroborated by our biochemical experiments. In comparative kinase inhibition studies of several next-generation ALK inhibitors, PF-06463922 was most effective against frequently observed ALK variants accounting for approximately 75% of neuroblastoma samples, including those with F1174L mutations. In vitro, PF-06463922 showed at least 3-4 fold higher potency than crizotinib in peptide phosphorylation assays, and its superior inhibition was consistently observed in cellular analysis of transforming ability. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate PF-06463922's mechanism of action and reveal how it induces apoptotic signaling networks without abrogating phospho-ALK. Taken together, these results support the argument that a modified ALK inhibitor may improve outcomes for patients with primary resistance to crizotinib and provide the preclinical basis from which to design a clinical trial for PF-06463922 for the treatment of ALK-mutated NBs.\"]",

        "Background":"['Mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor represent an important therapeutic target in neuroblastoma. The most frequently occurring somatic mutation, ALK F1174L, is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib only at higher doses in vitro, and not at all in in vivo. Moreover, ALK F1174L mediates acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-rearranged cancers, posing a therapeutic challenge in these diseases. To identify critical components of ALK F1174L-associated signaling pathways that contribute to neuroblastoma cell survival and whose simultaneous inhibition with ALK F1174L could increase sensitivity to crizotinib, we exposed neuroblastoma cell lines expressing ALK F1174L (Kelly and SHSY-5Y) to crizotinib (at treatment doses and exposures times titrated to abolish ALK phosphorylation, but in the absence of any detectable commitment to apoptosis), and compared their ALK-inactive gene expression signatures with vehicle-treated control cells in which the ALK F1174L signature remained active. We noted differential expression of genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in cells in which ALK F1174L was inhibited with crizotinib, with downregulation of AKT1, 2 and 3 and elevated expression of mTOR. Immunoblotting confirmed that downregulation of pALK upon exposure to crizotinib was accompanied by downregulation of pAKT473, with unchanged or elevated pRPS6. To test the possibility that the cytotoxicity of crizotinib could be enhanced by simultaneous inhibition of this ALK-driven pathway, we tested crizotinib in combination with the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, Torin2, both in cell lines and in xenograft models of neuroblastoma expressing ALK F1174L. Treatment with crizotinib had no standalone activity as demonstrated by lack of effects on tumor volume or survival. Treatment with Torin2 significantly suppressed tumor growth, but this did not translate into a prolongation of survival. Combined treatment with Torin2 and crizotinib resulted in significant attenuation of tumor growth (p<0.001), and prolongation of survival in comparison to control animals, as well as single agent treatment with either Torin2 or crizotinib. RPS6 remained phosphorylated in neuroblastoma xenografts of mice treated exclusively with crizotinib but was downregulated in cells treated with Torin 2, and in those treated with the combination. Together, these results suggest that single agent treatment with crizotinib at standard doses is less efficacious due to persistent activation of mTOR signaling and that mTOR pathway inhibition should augment the activity of crizotinib in the treatment of patients with ALK F1174L-expressing neuroblastomas and may even delay the onset of resistance in ALK-rearranged cancers in which this pathway is activated.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common extracranial solid tumors in childhood, which arises from neural crest cells in sympathoadrenal lineage. Although recent studies have revealed that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) signal is aberrantly activated in high-risk group of NB due to nonsynonymous mutations, gene amplification and mutation-independent overexpression, the regulatory mechanism of the signal remains elusive. Recently, we have identified neuronal leucine rich repeat 1 (NLRR1), a type I transmembrane protein, as a poor prognostic marker in NB and, notably, it accelerates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal to enhance cell proliferation. Here we have revealed that NLRR1 functionally affects ALK signal and vice versa in NB.Material & Methods', ' Cell growth of NB cell lines was evaluated by WST-8 assay or living cell imaging system. Immunoprecipitation was performed to check protein-protein interactions and concentrate secreted proteins. Further binding studies were performed by utilizing alkaline phosphatase-tagged and Fc-tagged proteins. Quantification of secreted proteins was assessed by sandwich ELISA assay. For ALK and EGFR signal inhibition, NB cells were treated with crizotinib, alectinib and erlotinib. The expression levels of ALK and NLRR1 were evaluated in embryonic Nlrr1 knockout mice as well as in the NB clinical samples by immunohistochemistry.Results', ' In the binding assays including immunoprecipitation, we found that NLRR1 extracellular domain physically interacted with the full-length ALK. Unexpectedly, NLRR1 expression suppressed ALK phosphorylation and cell proliferation in ALK-positive NB cells. Similar inhibitory effect was also observed by the treatment of the conditioned medium from the culture of NLRR1-expressing cells, suggesting a soluble form of NLRR1 protein. Certainly, the additional investigation confirmed that NLRR1 was cleaved to generate a soluble fragment of the extracellular domain. Conversely ALK inhibitors (ALKi) treatment resulted in up-regulation of NLRR1 and EGFR. Furthermore, EGF treatment restored ALKi-induced cell growth suppression. Additional erlotinib treatment certainly competed with the EGF rescue effect against ALKi. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that NLRR1 and ALK showed mutually exclusive expression pattern in NB tissues and murine embryonic dorsal root ganglia.Conclusion', ' We have identified the bilateral regulatory system between ALK and NLRR1, in which NLRR1 suppresses ALK phosphorylation whereas the inhibition of ALK results in the elevated expression of NLRR1 and EGFR. These findings in part support their mutually exclusive expression pattern in developing neural tissues and human NB. Further study should clarify the pathological meaning of the heterogeneity between ALK and NLRR1/EGFR pathways to develop a novel dual inhibition therapy in NB.']",

One such molecule is TAE684, a structurally unrelated ATP-competitive diaminopyrimidine derivative that has shown activity against ALKF1174L in both in vitro and in vivo models of ALK-driven cancers, such as lung cancer and NB.To identify mechanisms of acquired resistance to TAE684, we established in vitro models of resistance by serially exposing TAE684-sensitive SH-SY5Y NB cells (expressing ALKF1174L) to increasing concentrations of the compound over a prolonged period (> 1 year). The resulting TAE684-resistant SY5Y-TR cells exhibited >10-fold reduced sensitivity to TAE684 compared with parental cells. Three TAE684-resistant clonal lines (TR1-TR3) were analyzed, all of which showed downregulation of pALK. In addition, TR1 cells showed downregulation of pAKT but increased expression of pERK1/2 compared to parental cells, suggesting activation of compensatory signaling pathways. To identify candidate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that may account for this observation, we analyzed TR1 cells using phospho-RTK arrays. Upregulation of the AXL RTK was seen in the resistant cells as compared to the parental cells, and this was confirmed by immunoblotting in all the resistant clones. Concurrent with the role of AXL in tumor cell invasion, TR1 cells exhibited increased invasiveness in matrigel assays. Depletion of AXL expression by shRNA knockdown in TR1 cells led to their growth inhibition. TR1 cells were more sensitive to SKI-606, a Src/Abl inhibitor with activity against AXL, than parental cells. However, exposure to an Hsp90 inhibitor led to significant cytotoxicity in all the clones (IC50s<30nM), as compared to parental cells (IC50=304nM). Inhibiting Hsp90 in the TR1 cells led to a decrease in pAXL and pERK1/2 levels with a concomitant decrease in the binding of AXL to Hsp90. Analysis of AXL in TR1 cells ruled out mutation, genomic amplification or promoter demethylation as a basis for its increased expression; however, the AXL ligand, GAS6, was increased in the resistant clones.These studies demonstrate that AXL activation contributes to TAE684 resistance in ALKF1174L-expressing cells, and suggests that the same would be true for derivatives of TAE684 in clinical development. The finding that AXL is also involved in EGFR-targeted therapy in lung cancer suggests that AXL activation could be a general mechanism of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.']",

We investigated the alterations in ALK gene by FISH analysis, immunohistochemistry and screened for ALK mutations by sequencing the ALK gene in 737 CRC. We screened for mutations in ALK by sequencing the tyrosine kinase domain that covers exons 20 -28. ALK alterations were correlated with tumor pathological features including TNM staging, MSI status, KRAS and BRAF mutations, as well as clinical outcome. Overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meyer plots. On FISH analysis in colorectal cancers, ALK amplifications were observed in 2.6%. Amplifications and gain with increase in gene copy number(4 to 6 copies) were seen in 3.4%. No translocations were seen in our study. There were no associations with nodal metastasis and other clinical or molecular parameters. However in Stage III & IV, ALK amplification was associated with KRAS mutations. CRC subgroup with ALK amplifications showed a poor overall survival overall survival and ALK gene amplifications was an independent prognostic marker in multivariate Cox proportional Hazards model. IHC showed cytoplasmic overexpression in 14.7% CRCs and no associations with any clinical or molecular parameters. We are screening for ALK mutations in 100 CRC samples and results are awaited. The insights gained from our current study and future clinical trials are likely to directly benefit subgroups of CRC patients whose tumors are driven by ALK and will pave the way to more targeted approaches to cancer treatment.']",

        "Background":"[\"The effective treatment of advanced Neuroblastoma (NB) is still a challenge in pediatric oncology, because the clinical use of most therapeutics is limited by insufficient drug delivery to the tumor and high systemic toxicity. The discovery of the RNAi has great promise for anti-cancer therapeutics but, as in high-grade solid tumors a single oncogene addiction is rare, multi-'gene' target combinations are required and a targeted delivery system is mandatory to successfully translate RNAi-based therapeutics into the clinics.It is now ascertained the master role of ALK and related genes such as PHOX2B, able to promote its transcription, in NB growth and survival, opening new perspectives for RNAi-mediated therapies for NB. Nevertheless, even if the counterpart of tumor suppressor (TS) regulators in NB is not completely known, a number of miRNAs with TS functions have been found aberrantly under-expressed in NB and associated with aggressive phenotypes.To develop a new generation of targeted and multi-RNAi-directed therapeutics for NB, we are exploiting our well-established NB-specific delivery system, the GD2-Targeted Liposomes entrapping specific siRNAs, TL[siRNA], or miRNAs mimics, TL[miRNA]. The final purpose is to get simultaneously the silencing of the oncogenic functions of ALK and related genes and the replacement of miRNAs with TS functions in clinically relevant mouse models of NB. We have planned to test different combinations of individually entrapped TL[siRNA] or TL[miRNA] for in vivo therapeutic efficacy.In a pilot study, NB-bearing mice were treated with different TL[siRNA]. After 65 days from i.v. injection of HTLA-230 (WT ALK) cells, we observed\", ' about 50% of TL[siALK]-treated mice still disease-free, marginal effects with TL[siPHOX2A] and moderate effects with TL[siPHOX2B] formulations alone and a significant increased mice survival with an equimolar combination of TL[siRNA] of each gene. The enhanced efficacy of ALK and PHOX2 genes knockdown combination highlights a powerful therapeutic potential.After pilot transfection studies of SH-SY5Y (F1174L mut ALK) and GI-LI-N (WT ALK) cell lines, TS miRNAs mimics were screened and selected. Cell proliferation was evaluated at different days post-transfection. miR-96, miR-34a and let7b replacement resulted the most effective in inhibiting NB cell growth. Liposomal preparation of miRNA-NC and the above mimics for in vivo studies was tuned up according to the number of negative charges of the stem-loop sequence with an entrapment efficiency of 80-90%. Currently, an ongoing in vivo trial indicates promising results after replacement of miR-34a and let7b.We believe that the use of tumor-targeted biocompatible carriers of RNAi molecules able to replace loss-of-functions and to knockdown gain-of-functions in cancer cells at the same time is likely to represent an innovative modality for a more effective gene therapy.']",

        "Background":"[\"Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, a member of the insulin receptor family, with a tightly controlled expression pattern. Deregulated ALK expression has been linked to the development of several types of cancers. Typically, chromosomal translocations involving ALK generate constitutively expressed chimeric oncoproteins, such as NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and EML4-ALK in non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, activating mutations in ALK, and increased copy number that result in aberrant gene expression, have also been observed in neuroblastoma and colorectal cancers. Based on the above observations, several small molecule ALK inhibitors have been developed and are in clinical trials for a variety of tumors expressing this kinase. This has resulted in the use of crizotinib for the treatment of EML4-ALK + lung cancers.Recently several large scale immunohistochemistry and genome sequencing studies of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) revealed aberrant ALK expression. It was found that ALK mRNA expression was significantly different in alveolar (ARMS) and embryonic RMS (ERMS), the two major histological subtypes in children. Thus, ALK expression might play a role in tumorigenesis for this disease, and this kinase may represent a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of RMS. To answer this question we analyzed ALK expression in a large panel of RMS cell lines, and pediatric tumor samples by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. We also compared the sensitivity of these cells to a series of ALK inhibitors. Our results indicate that the majority of ARMS cell lines demonstrated significantly higher ALK mRNA expression as compared to ERMS, and to normal human myoblast control cells. This was confirmed by western analysis. Growth inhibition assays confirmed that all RMS lines were more sensitive to crizotinib and LDK-378 than control lines, consistent with the hypothesis that ALK is a driver of cell growth in these tumors.Based on our in vitro analysis, we suggest that ALK inhibition may represent an effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of ALK+ RMS. Preclinical studies to confirm or disprove this hypothesis are currently underway.Supported by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities\"]",

The stromal compartment of neuroblastoma is composed mostly of Schwann cells and they play critical roles in the differentiation, survival and angiogenic responses of tumor cells. In certain neuroblastoma cell lines, the coexistence of neuroblastic N-type and substrate-adherent S-type is frequently observed. One such cell line, SK-N-SH, harbors a F1174L oncogenic mutation in the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene. Treatment of SK-N-SH with an ALK chemical inhibitor, TAE684, resulted in the outgrowth of S-type cells that expressed the Schwann cell marker, S1006. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of these TAE684-resistant (TR) sublines revealed the presence of the ALK F1174L mutation suggesting their tumor origin, although ALK protein was not detected. Consistent with these findings, TR cells displayed 9-fold higher IC50 values than N-type cells. Also, unlike N-type cells, TR cells have readily detectable phosphorylated STAT3 but weaker phosphorylated AKT. Under co-culture conditions, TR cells conferred survival to N-type cells against the apoptotic effect of TAE684. Co-cultivation also greatly enhanced the overall phosphorylation of STAT3 and its transcriptional activity in N-type cells. Finally, conditioned medium from TR clones enhanced cell viability of N-type cells and this effect was Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase-dependent. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of tumor-derived S-type cells in protecting N-type cells against the apoptotic effect of an ALK kinase inhibitor through upregulating pro-survival signaling.

A panel of 18 neuroblastoma cell lines was analyzed for the presence of RAS-MAPK mutations and sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors of this pathway.ResultsNeuroblastomas that relapsed after chemotherapy showed dramatic clonal evolution, with only 33% of primary tumor mutations also detected at relapse. In 21 out of 23 patients, more somatic coding mutations were observed at relapse (median', ' 29 unique to relapse, range', ' 4-129). Unbiased pathway analysis of the somatic mutations detected in the relapse tissues identified a strong enrichment in genes associated with RAS-MAPK signaling (p = 6.1107). 18 of the 23 cases (78%) showed somatic mutations (N = 15) or structural alterations (N = 3) predicted to activate the MAPK pathway, and these were mutually exclusive', ' ALK (N = 10), NRAS (N = 1), KRAS (N = 1), HRAS (N = 1), BRAF (N = 1), PTPN11 (N = 1), FGRF1 (N = 1) and NF1 (N = 2). These RAS-MAPK mutations were clonally enriched at relapse and exist within clonal or major subclonal tumor populations. Seven of these RAS-MAPK mutations were detected only in the relapse tumor by whole genome sequencing (50X coverage), and only 2 of these 7 mutations were detectable in the primary tumor with targeted detection methods (104-105X coverage). Similar MAPK pathway mutations were detected in 11 of 18 human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines, and these lesions are predicted to be sensitive to small molecule inhibition of MEK in vitro (p<0.001) and in vivo (p<0.05).ConclusionsIn this study of 23 neuroblastoma cases selected based solely on having diagnostic-relapse specimens available for analysis, MAPK pathway mutations were highly enriched in the relapsed genomes, providing a potential biomarker for new therapeutic approaches to chemotherapy refractory disease. The fact that several ALK-RAS-MAPK mutations were found in the relapse but not in the corresponding primary tumors favors a model in which rare subclones with secondary driver mutations expand over time. However, it remains to be determined whether these mutations occurred de novo after treatment, were present in rare subclones below detection limits, or were undetectable due to spatial heterogeneity of the primary tumor, which will impact the clinical utility of targeted sequencing at diagnosis.

Many studies on sporadic cases with advanced NB have shown ALK mutated or highly expressed independently of its genetic status (mutated, amplified, wild-type) and its pivotal role in NB growth and survival. As ALK is currently considered a master driver of NB oncogenesis, the use of therapies inhibiting ALK represents a suitable treatment option.The ALK inhibitor Crizotinib was recently approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patient. However, as often observed with kinase inhibitors, some patients develop acquired resistance in part due to genetic ALK mutations. To overcome this limitation a selective and more potent ALK inhibitor, X-396, was developed that is currently in phase I clinical trial in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, but it has not been tested in preclinical animal models of NB.We have successfully employed a RNAi-mediated therapeutic approach to selectively knockdown ALK expression by using nanoliposomes entrapping siRNA and coupled with anti-GD2 antibodies to target NB cells. Our data demonstrate for the first time a role of ALK in NB-induced angiogenesis and in tumor invasion.Here, we aimed to test whether the combination of the novel ALK kinase inhibitor X-396 with the liposome-based silencing of ALK could represent a powerful synergistic and or additive effect in NB xenografts to promote long-term survival.In vitro, X-396 showed to be more effective than Crizotinib in inhibiting cell proliferation and in inducing cell death in both LAN-5 (R1275Q ALK mut, Crizotinib-sensitive) and SH-SY5Y (F1174L ALK mut, Crizotinib-resistant) cells.Pharmacokinetic profiles of X-396 after multiple PO administration in NB-xenografts revealed a good bioavailability and a moderate half-life. Biodistribution study clearly indicated that the concentration of X-396 8h post-administration was 35 fold higher in the tumor site than in plasma. X-396 reduced the tumor volume in subcutaneous SH-SY5Y NB-model in a dose-dependent manner and it was more effective than Crizotinib when administered at the same concentration. In orthotopic xenografts of SH-SY5Y and LAN-5 cells, X-396 significantly increased life span. In combination studies, all effects were significantly improved in the mice treated with targeted liposomal formulation of ALK-siRNA and X-396 compared to untreated control mice or mice receiving the single agent treatments. In the latter studies, further enhancement of life span was obtained by increasing the X-396 dose. Moreover, the combined treatment was also proven to be effective in the SH-SY5Y-pseudometastatic model in determining long-term survivors.

Further examination of these tumors with the MYC activation signature revealed different somatic alterations including MYCN P44L mutations, high expression of other MYC family members (MYC and MYCL), mutations in the RAS pathway, and FOXR1 fusions. Interestingly, a gene expression signature representing tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and regulatory T-cells significantly correlated with a worse outcome in NBLs with normal MYCN copy number, similar to that seen in tumors with the MYC activation signature. In contrast, NBL patients with tumors showing a signature of cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells have better outcomes. Furthermore, tumors of the latter subgroup express significantly more somatic SNVs comparing to the other two subgroups of worse outcome with MYC activation or TAM signatures, suggesting that expressed neo-antigens may elevate cytotoxic T-cell response in these tumors. Our study suggests that patients with high-risk neuroblastoma may benefit from immune-based therapies including check point inhibitors in the future trials.']",

        "Background":"['MYCN is a key driver in initiation and progression of neuroblastoma (NB) and represents a major target for novel drug strategies. We previously reported that the MYC repressor gene HBP1 was down regulated by mutant ALK via the PI3K-AKT-FOXO3 signaling axis1. Here, we further demonstrate that HBP1 upregulation suppresses proliferation of neuroblastoma cells by decreasing the MYCN signaling pathway. HBP1 levels were also shown to be repressed in neuroblastoma cells through MYC/MYCN driven upregulation of the miR-17~92 cluster, indicating that MYCN and mutant ALK both act to inhibit HBP1 expression in NB. Next, we tested the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), known to upregulate HBP1, and the BET inhibitor JQ1, which represses MYCN activity in neuroblastoma cells, and showed in vitro and in vivo synergistic effects on cell viability and tumor growth. Treatment with the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ-235 together with JQ1 also showed very strong synergistic effects. Further dissection of the HBP1 regulome using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and iRegulon analysis (http', '//iregulon.aertslab.org) allowed identification of the PRC2 component SUZ12 as a central node in HBP1 regulated signaling, mainly through controlling the repression of MYCN regulated genes. In keeping with this finding, GSEA analysis of our HBP1 overexpression data set revealed also strong enrichment for genes that are differentially expressed upon EZH2 inhibition in neuroblastoma cells. Because HBP1 has previously been shown to interact with HDAC, we tested the effects of the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat and panobinostat as single agents and in combination with BEZ-235. Both combinations showed a strong synergistic effect on cell viability. The molecular mechanism of this synergism will be explored through RNAseq expression analysis. We conclude that HBP1 is a crucial component in MYCN controlled repression of gene activity through PRC2 interaction and demonstrate novel opportunities for precision drugging of MYCN overexpressing NB cells. 1Lambertz et al.

Patients with relapsed high-risk disease have less than a 5% chance of survival despite intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Personalized therapies targeted against driver oncogenes may improve patient outcomes. However, genetic analyses of tumors biopsied at diagnosis generally harbor few, if any, targetable mutations [Pugh et al. Nat Gen 2013]. A recent study comparing the genetic profiles of tumors from 23 NB patients before and after disease relapse showed that relapsed tumors have a higher percentage of targetable mutations, particularly in the ALK/RAS/MAPK pathway [Eleveld et al. Nat Gen 2015]. We performed a retrospective study to further define the genetic landscape of diagnostic and relapsed NB. A total of 151 NB samples from 11 institutions were submitted for targeted sequencing of 236 genes commonly mutated in cancer using the FoundationOne assay; 40 at diagnosis, 67 at disease relapse, and 38 during primary therapy (i.e. second look surgery). Three patients were biopsied at both diagnosis and disease relapse. Patients were included in the study based solely on the availability of FoundationOne data. We identified 38 unique genes with known oncogenic mutations in this cohort. Of these, ALK was the most prevalent, with mutations occurring in 13.8% of patients, and there was a higher frequency of known oncogenic ALK mutations in relapsed disease (17% of patients) than at diagnosis (7.7% of patients). Further, there were more unique genes with known oncogenic mutations or gene amplifications in relapsed disease (25 mutated, 7 amplified) than at diagnosis (14 mutated, 2 amplified). Patients with relapsed disease were more likely to have at least one known mutation or gene amplification (60% vs. 41% of patients, P = 0.07). ALK mutations in NB are targetable with available therapies, and of the 37 other mutated genes detected, 13 are potentially actionable, falling within pathways that are targetable by drugs which are either currently available or in clinical trials. Patients with relapsed disease displayed a greater likelihood of having potentially actionable mutations (34% vs. 21% of patients). Of the 144 unique patients in this study, 21 were reported to have received targeted therapy based on the sequencing results and 14 outcomes were reported', ' while 10 patients showed progressive disease, one patient had a complete response, one had a partial response, and two had stable disease after targeted therapy. Our data confirm recent evidence suggesting that NBs undergo substantial mutational evolution during therapy, and as a result, relapsed disease is more likely to be driven by a targetable oncogenic pathway. These data support the conclusion that biopsy of relapsed NB has the potential to benefit the patient. Prospective clinical trials to match sequencing results to targeted therapies are required.']",

        "Background":"['Despite improvement of survival using multimodal chemo- and immunotherapy, high mortality and morbidity is still substantial for pediatric patients with metastatic cancers. Recent large-scale sequencing studies of pediatric tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and neuroblastoma (NB) have been focusing on somatic mutations, and revealed a low somatic mutation rate and surprisingly few recurrently somatic mutated genes in these childhood tumors. Currently, only a small portion of pediatric cancer cases can be explained by somatic driver events; whereas the cause for the majority of these diseases remains unknown. Because both these two types of tumors are uncommon, here we hypothesize that infrequent germline mutations (frequency<0.05 in control populations) may play a role in the initiation of sporadically occurring tumor.To test this hypothesis, we utilized sequencing data from two cancer patient cohorts consisting of RMS (n=133) and NB (n=222) patients, of which latter is a part of the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative for pediatric cancers. First, high-quality protein-coding changing single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called in both paired germline and tumor genomic DNAs. Then we excluded common variants with frequency >5% in a normal human population using the 1000 Genomes data. Due to our interest in the enriched variants, we further required the frequencies of variants in our rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma patient cohorts are higher than those in the ESP dataset, a non-cancer control population comprising 6503 individuals. There are 63247 SNVs fulfilled these selection criteria. Among them, 1589 have been reported in these pediatric cancers or in other malignancies in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project; and 1178 variants are present in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Of these HGMD variants, 49 have been reported in human diseases and 34 of them are known disease-causing mutations for human cancers and genetic disorders including TP53, ALK, CHEK2, and PINK1. Interestingly, the most frequent germline mutations in these pediatric tumors were rarely found in the TCGA project which mostly consists of adult cancers. This observation suggests a very different genetic background of pediatric cancer patients from that of the adult cancers, and warrants a careful examination of germline mutations in these cancers. Furthermore, previous studies have highlighted the importance of expression of variant genes (including tumor suppressor genes) for identification of driver mutations in cancers. Therefore we will use 178 transcriptome sequencing experiments available for these tumors (RMS=84; NB=93) to identify expressed variants in tumor.

MIBG (-) NBs are more undifferentiated pathologically and often fail to secrete the catecholamines HVA and VMA. We hypothesized that MIBG (-) and MIBG (+) HR NBs arise at different stages of neuroblast development and thus harbor different gene expression profiles that affect therapy response. We interrogated published microarrays (GSE19724, GSE3960) of primary HR NBs for gene expression changes based on norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression as NBs take up MIBG through this neural transporter. Twenty-one genes had > 3-fold significant change in expression based on NET expression. Genes involved in neural development (ALK, PHOX2B, TLX2, DBH, DDC) were significantly decreased in NET low NBs, supporting our hypothesis. NET low NBs also had a >3-fold increase in COUP-TF1, a transcription factor necessary for retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation in some cancers. COUP-TF1s role in NB is unknown. Microarrays containing prognostic data confirmed HR NBs with medium/high COUP-TF1 expression had superior patient survival compared to those with low COUP-TF1, independent of NET (p=.0004, http', '//home.ccr.cancer.gov/oncology/oncogenomics). In vitro, NB cell lines with high COUP-TF1 protein (SMS-SAN) were very sensitive to RA induced differentiation and shRNA inhibition of COUP-TF1 in SMS-SAN caused RA resistance. Similarly, overexpression of COUP-TF1 restored RA sensitivity in RA resistant, low COUP-TF1 expressing IMR5. RA treatment increased COUP-TF1 expression in NB coincident with RAR induction, suggesting COUP-TF1 is critical to RA response. shRNA inhibition of COUP-TF1 (shCOUP) rendered SMS-SAN resistant to doxorubicin, with SMS-SAN-shCOUP growing in doxorubicin doses that killed > 70% of wild type SMS-SAN, suggesting COUP-TF1 is necessary for cytotoxic response as well. We have identified a transcription factor that is associated with improved patient survival and in vitro studies suggest this is through mediation of therapy response. COUP-TF1 enhances RA induced differentiation in NB and we are the first to show COUP-TF1 also mediates cytotoxic response in cancer. This supports using COUP-TF1 as a biomarker for therapy response to improve risk stratification and treatment choice in HR NB.

The aim of the current study was to assess the prognostic value of NPY and its receptor expression in NB.We have tested corresponding samples of RNA, tissue sections and serum from 87 NB patients at various stages of the disease, obtained from the Children's Oncology Group. Samples were analyzed in terms of NPY system expression (NPY, Y2R and Y5R). Protein levels and mRNA in tumor tissue were quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real time-PCR, respectively, while NPY concentration in serum was measured by ELISA. The expression of other factors implicated in NB development and progression (MYCN, ALK, TrkA III, TrkB and BDNF) were detected on mRNA levels by real time-PCR. For each of the categorical prognostic variables, a Wilcoxon rank-sum or Fisher's exact test were administered to compare NPY and receptor values between groups, and a log-rank test was performed to compare the event-free survival and overall survival between groups.1) NPY mRNA was detectable in 100% of analyzed tumors. IHC staining revealed that NPY accumulated intracellularly in differentiating and maturing cells, while in undifferentiated NBs a significant amount of the peptide was observed in extracellular spaces, suggesting its free release. In line with this observation, serum concentrations of NPY were higher in the subset of NB patients with undifferentiated and poorly differentiated tumors, as compared to those with differentiating NBs (p-value = 0.03). High serum concentrations of NPY strongly correlated with several adverse prognostic factors (Stage 4, high risk, diploidy, and unfavorable histology) (p-value<0.03) and worse survival (p-value<0.04). 2) Y2R was expressed mainly in undifferentiated NB cells. mRNA of this receptor was detectable in 100% of cases and its levels positively correlated with MYCN expression 3) mRNA of Y5R was detectable in 84% of tumors assessed and correlated with expression of BDNF and its TrkB receptor, factors associated with poor prognosis.

        "Background":"['CD19 directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have shown clinical responses against B cell malignancies. However, CARs targeting other tumor-associated antigens have been less successful. Factors limiting CAR efficacy are not well understood. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a cell-surface protein overexpressed in a large fraction of neuroblastomas, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. We constructed MSGV1.ALK.BBZ retroviral vectors using single-chain variable fragment (scFv) sequences from murine monoclonal antibodies targeting ALK and transduced these into human PBMCs. ALK-CAR T cells lysed ALK+ tumor lines, but produced limited amounts of IFN-g and IL-2 upon co-culture with ALK+ tumor cells compared to CD19-CARs co-cultured with CD19+ targets. In order to identify potential differences between ALK-CAR and CD19-CAR induced signaling we employed a reporter system in which GFP expression was directed by an NFAT-responsive promoter and could be visualized by flow cytometry. T cells were co-transduced with lentiviral NFAT-GFP and MSGV1.ALK.BBZ or MSGV1.CD19.BBZ. Transduced T cells were co-cultured with tumor lines expressing ALK or CD19 antigen. GFP expression was induced within 4h of antigen exposure in double transduced T cells and persisted for at least 24h. The magnitude of GFP expression correlated positively with antigen density on tumor targets. Additionally, >50% of GFP+ cells retained CD19-CAR surface expression after antigen encounter. However, we observed drastically reduced surface ALK-CAR expression on GFP+ T cells after encounter with tumor targets. Upon further examination, we noticed that ALK-CARs were down-modulated from the T cell surface within 1h of exposure to antigen, and remained internalized for at least 24h. The magnitude of NFAT translocation in ALK-CAR T cells, as measured by GFP intensity, was also markedly lower than the magnitude of NFAT translocation in CD19-CAR T cells. These results suggest that limited numbers of CARs remaining on the T cell surface after initial antigen encounter may contribute to diminished ALK-CAR T cell efficacy, possibly by preventing temporal summation of repeated CAR signaling. Work is underway to prevent CAR down-modulation after antigen encounter, and to evaluate the impact of increased surface CAR retention on CAR functionality. In summary, optimal design of new CAR therapeutics requires a better understanding of essential factors limiting CAR efficacy. Through evaluation of a novel CAR targeting ALK, we have identified CAR down-modulation as one factor that may influence CAR-T efficacy, and may be amenable to modulation in order to improve CAR functionality.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Contemporary chemotherapy-based regimens provide cures for most pediatric & AYA cancers. However, for patients with relapsed/refractory malignancies, outcomes are poor & imply a distinct and aggressive biology. Identifying common themes in the molecular architecture & oncogenic mechanisms in these patients is a critical priority for drug development. We hypothesized that the molecular signature of cancers in these patients would be independent of histology. We also assessed the response to molecular alteration (MA)-targeted therapies. Methods', ' IRB-approved analysis of MAs in 306 relapsed/refractory pediatric & AYA malignancies (116 hematologic malignancies, 68 sarcomas, 46 neuroblastomas, 36 CNS, 14 liver, 9 renal, 17 other) was performed. DNA was analyzed for MAs (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA; Univ of Washington, Seattle, WA); additional MAs were identified by cytogenetic & fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses. Results', ' Median age was 8 years (range birth - 44 yrs). MAs were identified in 90.1% of patients & included a median of 2 mutations (range 0-18) in 133 cancer-related genes. In contrast to genomic analyses of de novo malignancies in children, a high frequency of TP53 MAs was identified (20.4% of patients) and was associated with inferior survival. MAs were identified in targetable pathways including cell cycle regulation (32.6%), DNA repair (7.2%), epigenetic (28.6%), RAS/RAF/MEK (24%), tyrosine kinase (TK; 18.4%), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (11.8%), and NOTCH/WNT (8.9%). A higher number of MAs was associated with inferior survival. Patients with alterations in epigenetic & TK pathways also had inferior outcomes. MAs were frequently independent of histology & the spectrum of mutations was similar to adult cancers. Exceptional responses were observed with MA-based assignment of therapies (epigenetic, NTRK, RAS/RAF/MEK & ALK). Conclusions', ' Relapsed/refractory pediatric & AYA cancers have frequent MAs independent of histology. The spectrum of MAs is distinct from de novo disease & potentially reflects tumor evolution & resistance mechanisms. These findings support MA-guided approaches to new drug development paired with adult trials.']",
