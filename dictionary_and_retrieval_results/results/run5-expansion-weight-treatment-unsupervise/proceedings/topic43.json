        "Background":"['Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common cancer among people of European ancestry. Aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) signaling plays a pivotal role in BCC carcinogenesis. Besides mutations in genes encoding HH pathway components, mutations in the p53 gene frequently are found in human BCCs. Consistently, our previous studies have found that the loss of p53 can dramatically accelerate BCC formation in ionizing radiation (IR)-treated Ptch1+/- mice. It remains elusive how p53 is activated in BCC development. DNA damage response (DDR) and oncogenic induced stress (OIS) are two essentially independent pathways leading to p53 activation although limited evidence suggests crosstalk between these pathways. In response to OIS, ARF is activated and leads to p53 activation, functioning as a tumor suppressor, in many cancers. However, the loss of ARF, unlike loss of p53, failed to affect the development of medulloblastoma in Ptch1+/- mice (Wetmore C., et al, 2001). In the present study, we investigated whether ARF affects BCC development in the same mice.To address this, we bred ARFGFP/GFP mice, in which ARF function is disabled and GFP is expressed under the control of the endogenous ARF promoter, with our Ptch1+/- mice to generate Ptch1+/- ARFGFP/GFP (designated as ARF mice) for comparison with Ptch1+/- K14CreER2 p53fl/fl (PF) mice. Following our standard protocol of tamoxifen injection at age 7.5 weeks to delete p53 specifically in K14-expressing keratinocytes (for PF mice) and treating both ARF and PF mice with ionizing radiation at age 8 weeks, we compared BCC development between the above 2 lines.We find that at age 5 months, ARF mice formed numbers of microscopic BCCs comparable to those in PF mice though the latter exhibited greater mouse-to-mouse variation. More importantly, both mouse lines developed initial visible BCCs at age 5 to 7 months, which is dramatically earlier than the age 9 to 18 months for the Ptch1+/- mice (ARF+/+ and p53+/+). In addition, ARFGFP/GFP mice responded to IR-induced DNA damage in a pattern essentially similar to ARF+/+ mice, indicating an intact DDR pathway as reported in the literature.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ARF is involved in BCC carcinogenesis as a tumor suppressor, probably playing the major, perhaps the exclusive, role in activating p53 in this process.']",

        "Background":"[\"Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the United States with the number of incidences persistently rising due to the depletion of the ozone layer and lack of adequate solar protection. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), composed of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), encompasses the vast majority of skin cancers with over 2 million new cases each year. Silibinin, an active bioflavanone was previously shown to have major protective effect against ultraviolet B radiation (UVB)-induced SCC through promoting DNA damage repair as well as inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis. To date, however, the efficacy of silibinin has not been tested against BCC, which alone accounts for about 80% of NMSC incidences. BCC mostly causes disfigurement, pain and morbidity, and warrants greater attention for its prevention and treatment. The hallmark of BCC has been the constitutive activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, mostly through the loss of function mutations in the patched (PTCH) gene. In the present study, we utilized ASZ001 cell line, derived from a mouse BCC tumor induced by UV-radiation in a PTCH1 heterozygous mouse, to evaluate the anti-cancer efficacy of silibinin against BCC. ASZ001 cells lack both copies of the PTCH1 gene and closely resembles the PTCH1 status in human BCC. We treated ASZ001 cells with either DMSO (control) or various doses of silibinin (25-100 M), and performed trypan blue exclusion, clonogenic, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution assays. Results showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) decreases the total cell number by 38-51% (p<0.001), 67-84% (p<0.001) and 40-95% (p<0.05-p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment. Clonogenic assay further confirmed the decrease in cell viability by silibinin, and we observed 18% (p<0.05), 92% (p<0.001) and 100% (p<0.001) decrease in colony formation with 25, 50 and 100 M doses of silibinin, respectively, in ASZ001 cells. Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) also increased the cell death by 2 folds (p<0.05), 3 folds (p<0.001), and 4 folds (p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment while annexin/PI staining confirmed that silibinin-induced cell death in ASZ001 cells is mainly apoptotic in nature. FACS analyses revealed that silibinin treatment significantly modulated the cell cycle distribution in ASZ001 cells, and we observed an S-phase arrest at 50 M silibinin dose and a G2M arrest at 100 M silibinin dose after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Molecular studies showed that silibinin treatment strongly decreases the expression of hedgehog signaling transcriptional factor Gli1, which is typically overexpressed in BCC and is known to regulate the expression of several oncogenes. Together, these results provide the first evidence of silibinin's efficacy against BCC cells, and suggest that silibinin could be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of both types of NMSCs.\"]",

        "Meeting_name":" Pharmacologic targeting of the Hedgehog (HH) signal transduction pathway significantly suppresses growth of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro.",
        "Background":"['OBJECTIVE. The HH signal transduction pathway plays crucial roles in organ morphogenesis and is active during embryonic development but quiescent in terminally differentiated cells. Binding of HH ligands to PTCH1 relieves its inhibitory activity on the pathway activator SMO leading to pathway activation and upregulation of target gene expression including the transcription factor Gli1 that serves as marker of pathway activation. It is reactivated in many solid cancers including NSCLC as we have previously demonstrated and proven to be the key oncogenic driver in tumors such as skin basal cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to determine if HH pathway regulates cell growth and survival of MPM cells and to evaluate the efficacy of pathway blockade using SMO antagonists (SMO inhibitor GDC0449 - GDC or the antifungal drug itraconazole -ITRA) or Gli inhibitors (GANT61 or the anti-leukemia drug arsenic trioxide - ATO) in suppressing the viability of not only NSCLC but also MPM cells.METHODS. Expression of main components of HH pathway in 8 MPM cells was assessed by qRT-PCR. Suppression of HH/SMO-mediated signaling by these pathway antagonists was determined by LightII cells. Selective knockdown of SMO to inhibit HH signaling was achieved by siRNA in 3 MPM cells H2373, Gardner and H2452. Cell viability following treatments with GDC, ITRA, GANT61or ATO were evaluated in a panel of 8 MPM cells and 8 NSCLC cells using MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined by annexinV/PE staining and flow cytometry.RESULTS. All MPM cells, similar to previously demonstrated in NSCLC cells, express varying levels of HH ligands, PTCH1, SMO with readily detectable Gli1 observed in 7/8 of MPM cells by qRT-PCR. SMO siRNA mediate 2- to 3-fold reduction of SMO and also of Gli1 gene expression by qRT-PCR, indicating significant HH pathway blockade. This was associated with 406% to 708% reduction of cell viability (p<0.01 versus non-target siRNA controls). All 4 pathway antagonists completely blocked HH activation in LightII reporter cells. Treating MPM or NSCLC cells with HH inhibitors resulted in 1.5- to 4-fold reduction of Gli1 expression. GANT61, ATO, ITRA and to a lesser degree GDC significantly suppressed viability of all cancer cells at low microM concentrations. More importantly, ITRA, ATO, GANT61 induce significant apoptosis (ranging from 30% to 60%) in representative MPM or NSCLC cells.CONCLUSIONS. HH signaling is active in MPM and regulates cell viability. ATO and ITRA are as effective as the prototypic SMO inhibitor GDC and the Gli inhibitor GANT61 in suppressing HH signaling in MPM and NSCLC cells. Pharmaceuticals that are FDA-approved for other indications but recently found to have anti-HH activity such as ATO or ITRA may be repurposed to treat HH-dependent MPM or NSCLC cells.']",

        "Meeting_name":" GLI3 repressor levels determine Hedgehog pathway activity and predict response to Smoothened antagonist in acute myeloid leukemia",
        "Background":"['The Hedgehog(Hh) signaling pathway is activated in most hematological and solid cancers and is a promising target for therapeutic development. Deletions in the receptor Patched (PTCH) or activating mutations in the upstream positive regulator Smoothened(SMO) have been reported in a few cancers such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but are largely absent in most tumor types; therefore, the mechanism of pathway activation in most cancers remains unknown. In normal tissues, Hh pathway activation via PTCH/SMO causes an increase in the downstream activating transcription factor GLI1 and a decrease in the transcriptional repressor GLI3R. We confirm that the Hh pathway is active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is required for cell survival, however, this activity is largely independent of the upstream activator SMO. Using siRNA knock down of GLI1, GLI3 and SMO in AML cell lines, Gli3 conditional knock out mice, and primary AML samples, we are able to show that loss of the GLI3R repressor function is sufficient to activate Hh target gene expression independent of ligand binding, and GLI3R levels correlate inversely with GLI1 levels. Importantly, we show that GLI3R is required for the therapeutic effect of SMO antagonists in AML samples and restoration of GLI3R restores sensitivity to SMO antagonists in AML cell lines. Epigenetic and gene expression analysis of the TCGA AML data set reveals that the GLI3 expression is silenced in most AML patient samples. We demonstrate in vitro and in patients that treatment with hypomethylating agents restores GLI3R levels and sensitivity to SMO antagonists in AML. In a transgenic mouse model of myeloproliferative disease (vav-Jak2V617F, gift of Joe Zhao, OUHSC) effective treatment with SMO antagonists are associated with increases in GLI3R but no changes in GLI1. Finally we show that GLI3R can directly repress expression of AKT and in vivo responses to SMO antagonists are correlated with changes in AKT expression, independent of GLI1 levels. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that GLI3R plays an essential role in SMO independent Hh signaling in AML, and suggests that GLI3R could serve as a potential biomarker for patient selection in SMO antagonist clinical trials. Furthermore, these data provide important mechanistic data to support rational combinations of hypomethylating agents with SMO antagonists in clinical trials.']",
