While several genetic resistance effectors have been identified, a comprehensive assessment of the genetic resistance spectrum in a large patient cohort may further inform resistance patterns and treatment strategies.  Methods', '  Pre-treatment and post-relapse biopsies were obtained from BRAFV600melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib or dabrafenib. Whole exome sequencing of tumor and normal samples was performed to identify exome-wide mutations, insertion/deletions, and chromosomal copy number alterations. Since somatic allelic fraction comparisons across treatment time points must account for variable stromal admixture between biopsies, novel algorithms were applied to impute purity and tumor cell ploidy, thus determining the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of each alteration. Those with enriched CCF in post-relapse samples were nominated as potential resistance effectors.  Results', '  30 patients (towards a goal of 77) were sequenced to a mean depth of 145-fold coverage. In acquired resistance patients (on drug  12 weeks, n=18), NRAS Q61R (28%) and BRAF amplifications (6%) were observed. The remaining patients had multiple clonally enriched alterations in the post-relapse tumors that may drive resistance, including MEK1 mutations at residues previously noted in an in vitro mutagenesis screen for vemurafenib resistance. In the intrinsic resistance cohort (on drug < 12 weeks, n=12), multiple putative resistance mutations not previously observed in the setting of acquired resistance were identified.  Conclusions', '  In addition to reported genetic resistance mechanisms, we identified new MEK1 mutations in resistant samples. For the majority of patients (67%) without events in these genes, computational algorithms identified new candidate drivers of RAF inhibitor resistance. Alterations that predict intrinsic or acquired resistance may also inform new approaches to melanoma therapy. Future studies incorporating longitudinal biopsies and genetic profiling will underpin a robust assessment of clinical resistance in melanoma and other cancers.']",

We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions demonstrated that demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. Parallel transcriptomic analysis revealed many known and novel oncogenic pathways aberrantly expressed and regulated by loss of DNA methylation.The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by immunohistochemistry on primary tumors and by Western blotting in BRAF V600E mutant and WT melanoma cell lines. Expression of its ligand IL34, but not of CSF1 was also shown in the melanoma cells by both ELISA and qPCR. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in traditional and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma.Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and lead to rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. In Western blotting experiments, the rebound of ERK phosphorylation after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of the CSF1R ligands CSF1 and IL34, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing CSF1R shRNA recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the CSF1R protein, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression as resistance was acquired. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo.

Methods', '  MM pts with BRAF V600 mutations that had progressed after BRAFi monotherapy were treated with D (150 mg twice daily) and T (2 mg daily). Treatment response was assessed by RECIST v1.1 every 2 cycles (8wks).

Blood samples were collected at baseline (BL), C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C4D1, and off-study. Level of mutant BRAF RNA in circulating tumor cells isolated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed by RT-PCR.   Results', '  Twenty pts were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 10%, disease control rate (DCR) was 45%, and median progression free survival (PFS) was 13 wks.

        "Background":"['BRAF and MEK inhibitors induce striking tumor regressions in BRAF V600E melanoma patients. However, relapse occurs in the majority of patients within several months. Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples. In future experiments we plan to test clinical samples from patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and we hypothesize that HGF, NRG1, and FGF2 signaling is elevated in patients with poor initial responses or relapse to BRAF or MEK inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Almost 50% of melanomas harbor mutations in BRAF, mainly V600E. The mutations are usually identified in the primary tumor. However, the primary tumor is often no longer available and metastases not always reflect the characteristics of the primary tumor. In melanoma it is not clear at what stage epithelial antigen is expressed. CETCs are present in peripheral blood in a significant proportion of patients with malignant melanoma. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether these cells belong to melanoma clone due to the presence of the BRAF gene mutation in these cells. For this reason, the analysis of multiple isolated CETCs from individual patients for BRAF gene mutations was performed.  Methods', ' Blood from patients with malignant melanoma was analyzed for cells positive for the EpCAM and Melan-A using the maintrac approach, avoiding cell selection and using an image analysis system for detection. Subsequently, between 8-20 EpCAM and Melan-A positive cells from each patient were isolated individually using a semi-automated capillary approach and deposited one by one into micro cups. The DNA of individual cells was amplified by whole genome amplification and assayed using the cobas BRAF V600 mutation test. Furthermore, we performed mutation analysis of cells after magnetic bead enrichment which is known to contain a mixture of CETCs and leukocytes.  Results', ' DNA could be amplified from all individually isolated cells. In addition, we analyzed the presence of V600 mutation after magnetic bead enrichment. A BRAF mutation was detected in 20 - 75 % of evaluable cells in patients with BRAF mutation in primary tumor. In advanced stage or metastatic patients under Vemurafenib therapy, we were not able to find mutated CETCs.  Conclusions', ' Individually isolated CETCs from the peripheral blood from patients with melanoma allow not only to detect mutations but also to determine the frequency of mutated cells. This proves that at least part of the CETCs is originated from the primary tumor. Furthermore, detection of BRAF mutation in CETCs may be crucial for a successful molecular-targeted therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Our group has been developing methods to quantitatively detect mutant BRAF DNA in the plasma of metastatic melanoma patients, with the aim of developing new biomarker assays. In this study we evaluated the potential of a probe-based, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to quantitatively measure copies of DNA encoding the mutant BRAFV600E and wild-type alleles in the plasma of patients undergoing treatment with a BRAF inhibitor. We previously showed this assay to be 100% specific with a sensitivity to detect 1 mutant copy among 10,000 wild-type copies when sufficient input DNA was used.Methods', ' Ten patients with BRAF-mutant stage IV melanoma were prospectively studied. At least 3 serially-collected plasma samples were available for each patient, corresponding to pre-treatment, best treatment response, and progression of disease as evidenced by PET/CT scan. DNA was extracted from plasma samples and concentrations were measured using a Qubit fluorometer. The relevant BRAF region was assayed using 24 to a maximum of 337 ng of DNA from each sample, using multiple replicate wells for dilute samples to maximize the probability of detecting BRAF mutant copies. Specific Taqman 5 hydrolysis probes for wild-type and mutant BRAF were employed along with common primers to measure the number of copies of each amplicon/reaction. The amount of amplifiable DNA was measured using RPP30 as a control gene.Results', ' All 10 patients had partial responses. We analyzed 35 plasma samples, of which 30 had a minimum of 4ml of plasma. Qubit-based DNA concentrations ranged from 6.9 to 1158 ng/ml. All samples yielded positive amplification of the BRAF and RPP30 amplicons. Total BRAF DNA concentrations ranged from 719 to 156,920 copies/ml plasma. Mutant BRAF DNA concentrations ranged from 0 to 13,028 copies/ml. The fraction of BRAFV600E amplicons ranged from 0 to 45%, with a minimal detected mutant fraction of 0.01%. In 8/10 patients, levels of mutant BRAF fell with clinical response and/or rose with disease progression. In 3 of these 8 patients, samples drawn 10 days to 2 months prior to imaging studies showed increased levels of BRAF mutant DNA prior to evidence of disease progression. In 1 of the remaining 2 patients levels of total BRAF DNA tracked with clinical outcome better than levels of mutant BRAF DNA. In 1/10 patients neither levels of mutant nor total BRAF DNA tracked with clinical responses.Conclusions', ' These results demonstrate that a ddPCR assay is able to quantitatively measure total and mutant BRAF DNA in the plasma of patients with stage IV melanoma. Levels of mutant and total BRAF DNA tracked with disease progression showing promise for this assay as a potential biomarker that may predict disease progression. Analyses of additional tumor-derived mutations in plasma DNA, and more precise assessments of disease response, are underway to determine optimal biomarkers to incorporate into melanoma clinical trial and patient care protocols.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma has seen a remarkable improvement in the treatment of advanced disease. However, the majority of patients still relapse with the emergence of resistant disease. This is especially true for BRAF inhibitors, were multiple mechanisms of resistance have been uncovered. However, the lack of dependable models to develop approaches to overcome resistance, poses a real challenge for clinical decisions on second line therapies. In addition, combination therapies necessary to achieve long term responses increase the number of possibilities to be assessed. In this study, we developed patient derived xenograft (PDX) models from BRAF inhibitor resistant patients and, after characterization, tested rational second line combination therapies in co-clinical trials.Fresh tumor tissue from 12 patients after progression on vemurafenib or dabrafenib was implanted into immune deficient NSG mice. Once the tumor grafts were established, mice were continually dosed with PLX4720 to approximate clinical plasma levels to preserve the resistant phenotype. Xenografts were then characterized for genomic alterations and pathway activation status using a targeted sequencing array and a reverse phase protein array, respectively. We found at least 2 and up to 9 known deleterious alterations in all samples, many of which have been described as conferring resistance. The protein array clustered into two major groups', ' MAPK pathway activated and PI3K pathway activated, again consistent with previous reports. Integrating these data allowed us to design rational combination therapies for in vivo testing. We treated a PDX model with MET amplification and high phospho c-Met with the BRAF inhibitor LGX818 20mg/kg QD, the MEK inhibitor MEK162 3mg/kg QD, and the c-Met inhibitor INC280 25mg/kg QD (all p.o.). Although INC280 alone led to significant decrease in tumor growth, only the LGX818/ MEK162/ INC280 triple combination led to complete and sustained tumor regression in all mice. Further, we tested a second PDX model with a MET amplification (albeit broader and lower) but baseline pMET on the protein level. In this model, INC280 did not show any antitumor effect confirming the specificity for c-Met and the importance of validating genomic data.In summary, using our BRAF inhibitor resistant PDX model pipeline we were not only able to identify actionable alterations in all models, but also to test rational second line combination therapies in pre-clinical in vivo trials. Genomic data alone might not be sufficient to accurately predict therapy responses and protein arrays were a valuable tool to validate deleterious alteration calls. This study represents an important step towards improving personalized medicine in melanoma, and highlights the potential use of c-Met inhibitors in melanoma combination therapy in a defined subset of patients.']",

Similar results were obtained using the Entrogen assay, with a PPA of 68.4% (26/38). The 2 most common activating mutations, V600E and V600K, had a similar PPA with both Qiagen and Entrogen tests. For all patients with wild type BRAF tumors, the research was negative on plasma DNA with both techniques (negative percent agreement, NPA = 100%). The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA = 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions', ' The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills. The unexpectedly low PPA of dPCR was attributed to the limited amount of DNA extracted from some samples.

The randomized, phase III clinical trial E2603', ' carboplatin, paclitaxel, +/- sorafenib (CP vs. CPS) offers the largest available collection of tumor samples from patients with well annotated clinical outcome to evaluate these associations. We evaluated copy number variants (CNVs) using array Comparative Genomic Hybridization in melanoma tumor samples from patients treated on this trial. Genomic DNA was hybridized on SurePrint G4 human CGH microarrays 2 x 440 K (Agilent). Copy number gains and losses were  0.3 or  -0.3 on a log2 scale, respectively (Nexus BioDiscovery, Inc). In 119 melanoma tumor samples, 45% had BRAF mutations, 24% NRAS mutations, and 24% without either (designated WT), CNVs were evaluated in an initial set of 26 genes known to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Overall genomic instability, as measured by number of genes with CNVs, was associated with poor ECOG performance status (P=0.007) and marginally significant for more organs with metastatic involvement (P=0.06), and is consistent with other studies suggesting that genomic instability is a predictor of worsened outcome. We further explored the association between copy number and somatic mutation status. Not surprisingly, BRAF gene amplification was observed in 91% of BRAF mutant melanoma tumor samples (P<0.001, as compared to 66% of NRAS/WT samples). The average value of BRAF copy number was higher in tumor samples with BRAF V600K mutations compared to samples with BRAF V600E mutations (1.11 v 0.55, P<0.001).

The average value of MET copy number was also higher in BRAF V600K mutant compared to BRAF V600E mutant melanoma (0.53 v 0.27, P=0.04), which may contribute to the differing clinical behaviors of melanomas with the two mutations. Patients with BRAF copy number gain had a trend towards lower overall response rate to either treatment compared to diploid (15.2% v 29.6%, OR=0.37, P=0.08). Patients with NRAS copy number gain receiving CPS had significantly improved overall survival compared to patients receiving CP alone (HR=0.35, P=0.03) in multivariable Cox model. We had previously found a trend suggesting an improved clinical response and PFS in patients with NRAS mutant melanoma treated with CPS as compared to CP. Our present study demonstrates an association between CNVs and treatment response to CP or CPS, as well as an association with somatic mutations. In addition, distinct cooperating genomic events identified in somatic mutation cohorts, such as MET and BRAF V600K gain, may contribute to the pathogenesis of melanoma tumors.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Cell-free tumor DNA (cftDNA) is released into the circulation and its recovery from plasma is a non-invasive alternative to tumor biopsy for applications related to molecular profiling. A potential use in therapeutic interventions is the periodic monitoring of cftDNA for the identification of molecular changes associated with resistance to target-specific treatments or when the mutational status in tumor tissue is not available. Methods', '  Samples (6 ml) of peripheral blood were drawn from patients with colorectal (CRC, n= 19) and thyroid (n= 1) cancers and melanoma (n= 8). CRC tumors were KRAS wild-type (n= 3) or carried the BRAF V600E (n= 6), KRAS G12D (n= 9) and G12V (n= 4) mutations. All melanomas and the thyroid cancer carried the BRAF V600E mutation. DNA was extracted from plasma with QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit to recover DNA fragments of 1000 bp. PCR amplification was carried out with a QX100 ddPCR System (Bio-Rad) on 20 L-samples containing cftDNA and TaqMan probes for BRAF V600E (1799T>A), KRAS G12D (35G>A) and G12V (35G>T) labeled with FAM/VIC. Samples were then loaded into a droplet reader, which discriminates the difference in fluorescence amplitudes on the basis of target gene amplification. Results', '  The concordance between mutations in tumors (T) and plasma (P) for BRAF V600E was', ' melanomas 8 T vs. 6 P; thyroid cancer 1 T vs. 0 P; CRC 6 T vs 3 P. Concerning KRAS in CRC the results were', ' G12D 9 T vs. 7 P, G12V 4 T vs. 0 P. Overall, the percentage of concordant samples were', ' V600E 60%, G12D 77,8%, G12V 0%. Interestingly, in 2 patients with wild-type KRAS tumor, the G12D and G12V mutations were found in plasma.  Conclusions', '  ddPCR is a third-generation PCR technique for highly sensitive detection of DNA fragments. Detection of mutations in cftDNA by advanced technological platforms has important applications in the monitoring of patients for the occurrence of secondary mutations, amplifications and expansion of cell clones that render their tumors resistant to target-specific anticancer agents, unraveling the resistant phenotype before the clinical progression of the disease.

BRAF alterations in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) are rare and BRAF is not currently considered a target for the disease. Methods', ' DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from a series of 10,428 cases of metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of > 550X for up to 315 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results', ' 135 (1.2%) of the mBC featured alterations in BRAF. The median age of the 135 female patients was 66 years (range 27 to 83 years). The primary tumor was used for CGP in 50 (37%) and from metastatic sites including lymph nodes, liver, bone, lung, brain, adrenal and soft tissue in 85 (67%). Using CDH1 mutation as the definition of lobular mBC, 126 (93%) were ductal and 9 (7%) were lobular histology. Activating BRAF alterations included amplifications (48%), SV mutations (39%) and rearrangements (13%). No (0%) mBC had multiple BRAF GA in the same case. 34% of BRAF SV were V600E and 66% were a wide variety of non-V600E GA. 10 (7.4%) of 135 BRAF mutated mBC featured ERBB2 amplification with 1 (1%) having an ERBB2 SV mutation and 1 (1%) having both ERBB2 amplification and SV GA. Of the 115 BRAF GA cases with known hormone receptor status 71 (62%) were ER negative, 44 (38%) were ER positive and 63 (55%) were triple negative (TNBC). Other targetable genes enriched in mBC with BRAF GA included CDK6 (p = 0.001), HGF (p < 0.001) and MET(p < 0.001). The median TMB was 4.5 with 17 (13%) of cases with TMB > 10 mut/Mb and 7 (5%) of cases with > 20 mut/Mb. Conclusions', 'BRAF alterations, although uncommon in mBC representing only 1.2% of cases, are enriched in TNBC and feature both targetable base substitutions and rare fusions. BRAF GA may be a rare cause of anti-HER2 therapy resistance in a subset of ERBB2 driven mBC. Targetable genes co-altered with BRAF in mBC include CDK6, HGF and MET. The TMB in BRAF altered mBC is significantly higher than that for mBC in general and indicates potential role for immunotherapy for these patients.']",

        "Background":"['BRAF is a human gene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signal pathway, which is important in regulating cellular responses to extracellular signals. Frequent mutations on BRAF gene have been detected in various types of human cancer, including malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, ovarian cancer and hairy cell leukemia. Among all, a single point 1799T>A (V600E) transversion, the most common mutation on BRAF, results in increased kinase activity. It serves as a driver mutation in several types of cancer and confers increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, detecting the BRAF V600E mutation may offer valuable information for cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Here we report a rapid, highly sensitive method for the detection of BRAF V600 mutation using a bridged nucleic acid (BNA) clamp technology associated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Due to the feature of enhanced affinity for hybridization template, BNA clamp is able to selectively block PCR reactions on the perfect match DNA sequence, while leaves the mismatch template unaffected. In this study several BNA clamps that bind to BRAF V600 wild-type (WT) template was designed, synthesized, and characterized. As compared to DNA clamp counterparts, these BNA clamps increased Tm values for the BRAF V600 WT by greater than 30C. In addition, BNA clamps efficiently distinguished BRAF WT (perfect match) from V600E (mismatch) templates (deltaTm >12C). In qPCR assays BNA clamps could suppress amplification of WT by >1,000-fold, while had little or no effects on the V600E mutant. Such BNA clamps allowed us to detect 1.0% or lower levels for the BRAF V600E mutant in a wild-type background. These results indicate that BNA clamp-based qPCR technology offers a new tool for rapid, sensitive detection of BRAF V600E mutation. The technology may be adapted for detection of mutations of a variety of biomarker genes.']",

In CRC, BRAF mutation is associated with poorer prognosis and may be a marker for new targeted therapies. In MM, BRAF mutations are predictive of the efficacy of BRAF-targeted therapies. In CRC, only the V600E change is observed regularly, while in MM different BRAF mutations may occur. To improve the identification of BRAF mutations, we developed novel simplex and multiplex real-time PCR-based assays (SensiScreen) and compared them with Direct Sequencing (DS), Mutant-Enriched PCR (ME-PCR) and Cobas. Methods', ' SensiScreen assays (PentaBase, Denmark) comprise SuPrimers (DNA primers with increased specificity), BaseBlockers (suppressing amplification of wild-type genes) and HydrolEasy probes (hydrolysis probe with increased S/N ratio and sensitivity).

In plasmids and cell lines experiments, DS had a limit of detection of 10%, ME-PCR of up to 0,5% and SensiScreen of < 0,1%. In 100 CRC cases, we found 7 (7%) BRAF mutated patients by DS, 9 (9%) by ME-PCR and 10 (10%) by SensiScreen. In 100 MM patients, we found 51 (51%) BRAF mutations by Cobas and 55 (55%) by SensiScreen. Simplex and multiplex SensiScreen assays identified the same mutations. Conclusions', ' SensiScreen simplex and multiplex assays are novel, rapid, easy-to-use and highly sensitive methods for BRAF mutation analysis in CRC and in MM.

        "Background":"['Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) accounts for approximately 2% of diagnosed malignancies in canines. The majority of canine TCCs are invasive, intermediate to high grade tumors sharing similarities with human muscle invasive TCCs in risk factors, histology, sites of metastasis, and therapeutic response to single agents. Whole exome sequencing of canine TCC tumors was performed to identify somatic mutations in known cancer driver and repressor genes that could potentially contribute to canine TCC pathogenesis. A valine to glutamic acid mutation in BRAF homologous to the activating V600E mutation identified in human melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancers was identified in 70% of sequenced tumors. Sensitivity to the BRAFV600E inhibitor Vemurafenib was tested in three BRAF mutant canine TCC cell lines (Bliley, Tyler1 and Tyler2) and two BRAF wild type canine TCC cell lines (Angus1 and Kinsey). All five canine TCC cell lines exhibited IC50s greater than 10μM, with BRAF mutant cell lines being slightly more sensitive. These sensitivity ranges are similar to those of some mutant human colorectal cancer cell lines, indicating that additional mechanisms may contribute to Vemurafenib resistance. Western blot analysis was performed to measure relative abundance of pERK, a downstream target of BRAF, in canine TCCs in response to serum starvation. All TCC cell lines showed sustained pERK expression in the absence of serum, indicating constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The five canine TCC lines were treated with 15μM Vemurafenib for 6 and 24 hours and their lysates were analyzed for pERK protein expression. pERK abundance was decreased in only the BRAF mutant cell lines after 6 hours of treatment. However, this decrease was less pronounced after 24 hours, suggesting that resistance mechanisms are bypassing BRAF to activate ERK. Sequence analysis of an additional panel of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine TCCs also revealed a mutation in RanBP2 in 31% of samples. Strikingly, the RanBP2 mutation appeared to be mutually exclusive to BRAF V to E mutant tumors with only two of the analyzed samples carrying both mutations. Significant tumor heterogeneity was implicated due to low level mutant amplification in these samples. It has been reported that loss of RanBP2 is synthetic lethal in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer. Since RanBP2 forms complexes with CRM1 at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear export and at the kinetochore during mitosis, canine TCC cell lines were treated with KPT-185, a CRM1 inhibitor. BRAF mutant TCC cell lines had IC50 values ranging from 45nM to 65nM and were approximately ten-fold more sensitive than wild type cell lines. Overall, this data indicates that the pathogenesis of canine TCC likely depends on driving factors in addition to constitutive BRAF signaling, but Vemurafenib resistant BRAF mutant tumors can be targeted through inhibition of the nucleopore complex.']",
