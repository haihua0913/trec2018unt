        "Background":"['The use of ABL1 kinase inhibitors has dramatically improved the outcome for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. However, resistance after treatment still poses a major clinical challenge. The most common resistance mechanism following treatment with first or second line therapy is the occurrence of a T315I mutation in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1. Only one clinically available ABL1 inhibitor, ponatinib, has been shown to target this gatekeeper mutation, but has recently been associated with significant adverse effects. Hence, there is an unmet need for new and improved therapies for patients with T315I BCR-ABL1 leukemias.In this study we set out to functionally and molecularly profile BCR-ABL1 T315I-driven CML/Ph+ALL patient samples to understand the disease pathogenesis and identify novel therapies with a drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) platform covering 306 approved and investigational oncology compounds. Mononuclear cells isolated from patient bone marrow were plated with drugs on 384-well plates. Each compound was tested for its effect on cell growth and survival in a 10,000-fold concentration range enabling the generation of dose response curves and by comparing to healthy donor mononuclear cells, selective drug sensitivity scores (sDSS).Ex vivo DSRT results of one CML and two Ph+ALL patient samples with the T315I mutation revealed a marked and specific sensitivity (IC50 30-40nM) to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, originally developed as a VEGFR inhibitor. Strikingly, sensitivity to axitinib was higher in these T315I positive patient samples than in T315I negative CML or ALL patient samples or any other leukemic samples. Supporting the notion that axitinib is a direct T315I BCR-ABL1 inhibitor we observed that Ba/F3 cells transformed with T315I BCR-ABL1 were sensitive to axitinib while the same cells transformed with wild type BCR-ABL1 were not. Finally, we discovered that axitinib has been described to have selective binding towards T315I ABL1 compared to the wild type kinase (Kd 1.5 nM vs. 36 nM, respectively, Davis et al. 2011, Nat. Biotechnol. 29', '1046-1051). Based on this information, the T315I CML patient mentioned above was compassionately treated with axitinib for 2 weeks resulting in a rapid 4-fold reduction of the mutated transcript levels in blood suggesting targeted in vivo activity of the drug.In summary, we demonstrated that axitinib is a potent BCR-ABL1 T315I inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. In light to the fact that axitinib is currently approved as a second line therapy for renal cell carcinoma and is well tolerated in patients, there is an opportunity to repurpose axitinib for Ph+ leukemia patients with T315I mutations with significantly shorter clinical development time.']",

        "Background":"['Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors are the standard therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). While effective in controlling disease in chronic phase, these inhibitors often fail to completely eliminate Bcr-Abl+ CML cells and also fail to achieve durable remissions for advanced CML and Bcr-Abl+ acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Our lab employed a large-scale synthetic lethal shRNA screen to identify genes involved in CML survival upon treatment with the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib (IM) [Cancer Cell. 2010;18(1)', '74-87]. This screen identified several genes involved in energy utilization including a component of pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase. CML proliferation depends on Bcr-Abl-driven glycolysis for energy production. Upon IM treatment, we hypothesized that these cells are forced to rely on other sources of energy including the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, and that targeting alternative energy production pathways will enhance IM-mediated elimination of CML cells. Thus, we predicted that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition would cooperate with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) to eliminate Bcr-Abl+ leukemia. Indeed, our experiments have shown that knocking down pyruvate dehydrogenase in human blast crisis Bcr-Abl+ CML cells (K562) greatly sensitized cells to IM in vitro. Conversely, supplementing the cell culture media with increasing concentrations of methyl-pyruvate protected K562 cells from IM treatment. Moreover, we found that the mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor Oligomycin A (OA) also synergized with IM to kill CML cells in vitro. Interestingly, the doses of OA are far below the IC50 and do not affect the oxygen consumption rates, indicating that mitochondrial respiration is not inhibited. These OA doses alter mitochondrial transmembrane potential and increasing superoxide levels. In addition, OA enhanced elimination of Bcr-Abl+ cells by a Bcr-Abl TKI in vivo and prolonged disease-free survival in a mouse model of Bcr-Abl+ B-ALL. Notably, drug doses of OA used had no apparent adverse effects on these mice. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism as an adjuvant drug therapy may prevent the survival of residual Bcr-Abl+ CML cells upon tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.

        "Background":"['This study found that long-term exposure of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells to BCR/ABL thyrosine kinase inhibirors (TKIs) caused drug-resistance in association with an increase in levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and a decrease in levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-217. These observations are clinically relevant; an increase in levels of DNMT3A in association with downregulation of miR-217 were noted in leukemia cells isolated from individuals with BCR/ABL TKI-resistant philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and CML. Further studies with TKI-resistant K562 cells found that forced expression of miR-217 inhibited expression of DNMT3A through a miR-217-binding site within the 3-untranslated region of DNMT3A and sensitized these cells to growth inhibition mediated by the TKI. Of note, long-term exposure of K562 cells to dasatinib (10 nM) together with 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) (0.1 M) potently inhibited proliferation of these cells in association with upregulation of miR-217 and downregulation of DNMT3A in vitro. In addition, a decrease in levels of DNMT3A and an increase in levels of miR-217 were noted in K562 tumors growing in immune deficient mice that were treated by the combination of 5-AzadC and dasatinib. Taken together, Ph+ leukemia cells acquire TKI-resistance via downregulation of miR-217 and upregulation of DNMT3A. Inhibition of DNMT3A by forced expression of miR-217 or 5-AzadC may be useful to prevent drug resistance in individuals who receive TKIs.']",

        "Background":"['A range of hypotheses have emerged as to why imatinib (a targeted inhibitor of bcr-abl) seems unable to eliminate the most primitive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, such as bcr-abl amplification and clonal evolution. The biology of the CML imatinib-resistant cell is of critical importance to understanding why despite high percentages of initial clinical responses to imatinib (>80% of patients in chronic phase at some point obtaining complete cytogenetic remission), resistance, relapse and/or progression occurs in 20-30% of cases and most patients in remission still have residual disease detected by sensitive PCR monitoring of the CML specific bcr-abl transcripts. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well, patients are typically treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen that leads to clinical responses in 80-95% of patients. However, over half of these patients will relapse and eventually die of disease suggesting that a subpopulation of leukemic cells are capable of both surviving treatment and causing regrowth of the tumor. In both diseases, it has not been definitively established what the identity of the cells responsible for resistance and relapse is, nor what combination of mutations, gene expression changes, and alternative splicing events are required for these cells resistant phenotype. Assessing changes in gene expression in the bulk samples provides a valuable overall picture of the phenotype of the predominant cell type is or if there are large changes in expression in less frequent cells, but will completely mask changes exhibited by rare cells. One limiting factor in our ability to study more levels of heterogeneity in leukemia subpopulations is the lack of appropriately powerful and sensitive techniques to assay more complex facets of cellular behavior in such small populations. We have developed several multiplexed, high sensitivity analysis techniques and applied them to study multiple facets of cell behavior and identity in rare cell samples, down to the single cell level. By analyzing expression and genotype in smaller samples, direct from cells, we can analyze heterogeneity in expression and alternative splicing, combined with both cell surface markers and the presence of multiple mutations. These innovative techniques have allowed us to study clonality in AML samples in detail via a robust assay that can identify multiple mutations occurring concurrently in single cells. We have also optimized a protocol to simultaneously assay gene expression of 24 in 100-500 cell samples from flow sorted leukemia cell populations. Finally multiplexed assays for alternative splice variant detection in single cells has enabled us to study whether alternative splice variant expression of several genes occurs concurrently in the same cells, or in different cells of the population. With these techniques in hand we have the unique opportunity to begin studying the biology of these diseases from a previously unrealistic angle.']",

        "Background":"['Dastinib (BMS-354825) is a FDA-approved small compound that was developed for chronic myeloid leukemia as a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor of wild-type BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases. Valproic acid (VPA; Orfiril) has been a well-known anti-epileptic drug worldwidely, and belong to the class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. The aim of this research is to determine the anti-leukemic effects of combination of dasatinib and VPA or their mechanism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. In this study, dasatinib showed potent inhibitory effects on VPA-treated AML cells that were associated with induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest and also apoptosis including the cleavage of PARP, caspase-3, -7 and -9. Moreover, inhibitors of caspase-3 and -9 (Z-DEVD-FMK and LEHD-CHO) efficiently inhibited dasatinib-induced apoptosis in VPA-treated AML cells. Therefore, dasatinib/VPA-induced cell death occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Also, inhibitors of MEK/ERK (U0126 and PD98059) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) efficiently inhibited dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis. The combination of dasatinib and VPA differentiation capacity of AML cells is more powerful than each drug alone. So the combination is enough to push AML cells to death strongly by G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK controls dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis as an upstream regulator. Finally, co-treatment of dasatinib and VPA is contributed to AML cell death by regulation of differentiation capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that dasatinib and VPA together have a potential for anti-leukemic therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Molecularly targeted therapies have been exceptionally successful in the treatment of some malignancies, most notably chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However in other cancers, e.g. Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), drug resistance is a frequent occurrence. Resistance mutations may pre-exist as a consequence of intra-tumor heterogeneity; thus the extent of heterogeneity may determine the likelihood of treatment failure. Intra-tumor heterogeneity is challenging to quantitate, as heterogeneous mutations are likely to occur below the background error rate of conventional approaches for mutation detection. To overcome this limitation and explore the relationship between intra-tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance in Ph+ leukemias, we utilized single-molecule Duplex Sequencing (DS) of the ABL1 gene. DS eliminates sequencing errors by independently tagging the two strands of individual DNA molecules; true mutations are present at the same position in both strands, while PCR and sequencing errors are only present in one strand. DS has an error rate below 0.00001%, and thus enables quantitation of heterogeneous mutations with unprecedented resolution. We find that CP-CML, a disease that is often well controlled with targeted therapy, has an extremely low burden of intra-tumor heterogeneity at the time of diagnosis, with a sub-clonal mutation burden similar to that of normal individuals. Simulations which take into account the low cancer stem cell fraction of CP-CML and the sub-clonal mutation burden we measured reveal that only a minority of CP-CML patients will harbor pre-existing drug resistance, which may explain the unusual success of targeted therapy in this setting. Next, we studied patients with advanced Ph+ leukemias (refractory BP-CML and Ph+ ALL), which have a high rate of treatment failure and poor outcomes. We find that patients with BP-CML and Ph+ALL have a significant elevation in sub-clonal heterogeneity relative to those with CP-CML. We demonstrate that the higher extent of intra-tumor heterogeneity correlates with a significantly higher rate of drug resistance mutations and compound resistance (i.e. two concurrent resistance mutations) in patients. Unlike CP-CML, pre-existing mutations conferring resistance to targeted therapy are nearly certain in refractory BP-CML and Ph+ ALL as a consequence of the load of intra-tumor heterogeneity and high cancer stem cell fraction. We support this concept by three distinct approaches', ' (i) detection of pre-existing sub-clones that drive treatment failure; (ii) modeling the growth kinetics of resistant clones; and (iii) extrapolation of the mutation burden measured by DS. Our results suggest that intra-tumor heterogeneity influences the likelihood of resistance to molecularly targeted therapy. Quantitation of sub-clonal mutation load may be broadly applicable in other malignancies for predicting the likelihood of response to targeted therapy and monitoring disease progression.']",

All samples had already been scored by SS. UDS of the BCR-ABL KD was done using Roche 454 technology (lower detection limit, 0.1%). Seqnext software was used for alignment and variant identification; Jalview and Figtree softwares were used for haplotype and phylogenetic reconstruction.Results - UDS showed that SS often misclassifies or underestimates BCR-ABL KD mutation status. In more than half of the cases, UDS revealed that up to five minor mutations with 1-20% abundance were present, either in samples scored as wild-type by SS or in samples already bearing one or more dominant mutations. The high degree of complexity was even more evident when the clonal relationships of multiple mutations were reconstructed and the relative abundance of all mutant subclones coexisting at each timepoint was assessed. This revealed that identical mutations may be acquired in parallel by independent subclones (e.g., one wild-type and one already harboring a mutation), via the same or different nucleotide changes leading to the same amino acid substitution (convergent evolution). Longitudinal quantitative follow-up showed that the landscape of all competing mutant subclones is highly dynamic, and that dominant subclones may be replaced as quickly as within one month in case of selective pressure change.

        "Background":"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the first cancer that was shown to originate from a genetic abnormality - the Philadelphia chromosome translocation, and production of its constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase product, BCR-ABL. The disease progresses slowly from chronic phase to accelerated phase, and later transforms to blast crisis (BC) stage. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subset of tumor cells that have acquired certain treatment-resistant stem cell properties. High levels of RNA editing are associated with a primitive transcriptional program typical of human embryonic stem cells, and RNA editing plays an important role in both embryonic hematopoietic cell fate determination and in maintenance of normal hematopoiesis. Human RNA editing occurs primarily in secondary structures created by Alu retroelements and is carried out by enzymes such as the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. Among these, ADAR1 was also recently shown to be required for normal hematopoiesis by suppressing interferon-induced apoptosis. Our research focuses on dissecting the role of ADAR-mediated RNA editing in normal human hematopoietic progenitor cell development compared with malignant editing programs that may be activated in leukemia stem cells (LSC) during the progression of human CML. Our data demonstrates that BC LSC harbor increased levels of the interferon-responsive ADAR1 p150 isoform compared with chronic phase (CP) progenitors and normal cord blood progenitors. Expression of this isoform also exhibits a positive correlation with BCR-ABL expression levels - an effect which is specific to BC progenitors, suggesting that ADAR1 expression correlates with disease progression from CP to BC. In vitro hematopoietic progenitor assays with normal cord blood progenitors and CP samples transduced with lentiviral vectors overexpressing human ADAR1 reveals a significant shift in cell differentiation fate towards granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) colonies, which has been shown to be the initiating LSC population in CML Correspondingly, a progression towards erythroid lineage was observed in BC CML LSC transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA targeting ADAR1. Further qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the mechanism through which ADAR1 drives LSC and HSC differentiation towards myelopoiesis involves regulation of PU.1, which in turn inhibits GATA1 expression. Moreover, in vivo studies in a robust humanized CML mouse model showed a significant decrease in LSC serial transplantation potential of lentiviral shADAR1-transduced BC progenitors transplanted into neonatal RAG2-/-c-/- mice. Together, these data support a crucial role for ADAR1 in cell fate determination and self-renewal potential of hematopoietic stem cells in both normal human progenitors and in malignant LSC that drive disease progression and therapeutic resistance.']",

In this study, CCmut3 is delivered to cells as a protein by utilizing a leukemia-specific cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). Here, recombinant CPP-CCmut3 was expressed, purified, and tested for its anti-oncogenic activity. CPP-CCmut3 was able to enter two leukemic cell lines (K562 and Ba/F3-P210) and inhibit Bcr-Abl activity as shown by induction of necrosis/apoptosis via 7-AAD/Annexin V staining, reduction of oncogenic potential in colony forming assays, reduction of cell proliferation, and inhibition of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation (kinase activity). Further, CPP-CCmut3 did not enter non-leukemic cell lines (HEK293 and MCF-7). While CPP-CCmut3 was able to enter the parental, non-leukemic Bcr-Abl- Ba/F3 pro-B cell line, it revealed no signs of activity in the assays performed, as expected. These results indicate the feasibility of using CPP-CCmut3 as a therapeutic against CML.']",

Therefore identification of targeted agents that could enhance the activity of TKIs is urgently needed. ABT 199 is a BCL-2 inhibitor which has shown pre-clinical activity against a variety of B cell malignancies. Here we evaluate the combination of ABT199 across a panel of TKIs to explore potential mechanisms of synergy in hopes to better define the optimal combination for future clinical studies.  Methods', '  Drug efficacy in vitro was determined using the Ph+ALL cell line SupB15. Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib or ponatinib in combination with ABT199 for 72 hours. Cell viability was assessed using a colorimetric MTS assay, and cell apoptosis was assessed with annexin V staining. Combination effects were calculated using Calculsyn software. Standard immunoblots were used to assess inhibition of downstream pathways.  Results', '  The combination index (CI) values for each of the TKIs with ABT199 ranged between 0.13  1.4 for Imatinib, 0.4  1.05 for Nilotinib, 0.06  0.33 for Ponatinib, and 0.07  0.64 for Dasatinib, where CI < 1 predicted synergy. As a single agent, ABT199 induced the highest degree of apoptosis, enhanced preferentially by dasatinib and ponatinib. Evaluation of key phosphorylated kinases showed that all four TKIs effectively inhibited the downstream ABL1 target pCRKL. In addition, both dasatinib and ponatinib inhibited pLYN while dasatinib also inhibited pBTK.  Conclusions', '  Combination of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL targeting in Ph+ALL is synergistic in vitro. The enhanced synergy seen with dasatinib and ponatinib may be due to the ability of these agents to target additional pathways active in leukemic cells. The addition of ABT-199 as part of TKI therapy for adult Ph+ALL warrants further clinical investigation, particularly in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is driven by the hyperactive fusion kinase Bcr-Abl, generated by a chromosomal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. This oncogenic tyrosine kinase builds up its own signaling network with various proteins such as the docking protein Gab2 or the Src kinase Lyn. As a result, the cells become addicted to the constant signals derived from this fusion kinase. This is the reason why selective Bcr Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as Imatinib mesylate or dasatinib, became so successful in the therapy of CML. Despite the great success of these TKIs in CML treatment, TKI resistance remains a serious clinical problem. These resistances can be caused by mutations in the Bcr-Abl oncogene, like the clinical relevant T315I mutation or by aberrant activity of components of the Bcr-Abl signaling network. In that regard, we could show that the overexpression of Gab2 or the expression of a hyperactive mutant of Lyn can confer TKI resistance.Using different CML cell lines and models we aimed to identify new approaches to overcome TKI resistances caused by Bcr-Abl mutations or aberrant downstream signaling. Therefore, we screened inhibitors for their ability to overcome Gab2 mediated resistance or to inhibit the activity of T315I mutated Bcr-Abl. We identified the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and axitinib, both clinical approved as second line drugs in renal cell or hepatocellular carcinoma, as compounds reducing the viability of Bcr-AblT315I transformed cells. Interestingly, these inhibitors were highly active against TKI resistant Bcr-Abl positive cells in contrast to non-transformed cells. These results invite for the further evaluation of sorafenib and axitinib in the treatment of TKI-resistant CML.']",

Bcr-Abl homo-oligomerization via its N-terminal coiled coil (CC) domain is required for tyrosine kinase activity. Our previous work has shown that it is possible to inhibit Bcr-Abl activity by targeting the CC domain with a peptidomemetic known as CCmut, delivered as a protein using a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP-CCmut). CPP-CCmut selectively enters leukemic cells and inhibits Bcr-Abl, as seen by Western blot, 7AAD, Annexin V, cell proliferation, and colony forming assays.This leukemia cell-permeable CPP-CCmut protein domain is our lead compound for CML therapy, but to be translatable to the clinic it must be modified to improve proteolytic stability. For this reason, we created stapled versions of this CPP-CCmut. Stapled peptides are resistant to proteolysis, and are emerging as a viable strategy for disrupting protein-protein interactions in diseases including HIV and cancer. Until recently, peptide stapling required incorporation of unnatural amino acids; therefore these peptides were created via solid-state synthesis. However, the synthesis of the 81 amino acid CPP-CCmut is no trivial matter. The ability to staple a longer sequence such as our protein domain is now possible using thiol-ene coupling. This exciting new chemistry allows for the stapling of recombinant proteins at substituted cysteine residues (instead of stapling substituted unnatural amino acids incorporated into synthetically made peptides). Thiol-ene coupling is used here to staple recombinant CPP-CCmut, and provides a path for translation of our lead compound to the clinic.Molecular modeling has identified optimal locations for staples on CPP-CCmut, which include 29/36, 36/43, 50/57, 57/64, as well as double staples 29/36-50/57 and 36/43-50/57. These staple locations still allow for dimerization of CPP-CCmut with Bcr-Abl, as indicated by free energy calculations and helicity. The staple locations have also been optimized for maximal coverage from proteolytic degradation.This work acts as a proof-of-concept that proteins (not just peptides) can be stapled, thus greatly expanding the variety and complexity of stapled proteins for use in the exciting field of targeting protein-protein interfaces to treat disease.']",

Not only can PBA2 inhibit cell growth but also induce terminal cell differentiation in a series of kinase mutant CML cell lines as well as T315I mutation. Remarkably, the mechanism of action of this compound involved the simultaneous inhibition effect of BCR-ABL and GSK3, which could be a fruitful approach to suppress the -catenin/CBP signal pathway that promoted the interaction of -catenin/p300, leading to growth inhibition and subsequent terminal differentiation. More importantly, we found a novel molecular link between CBP and BCR-ABL. We showed that CBP could regulate BCR-ABL expression through activating CREB which binds to the BCR-ABL promoter in CML cells to start transcription, and the BCR-ABL in turns affect the expression level of CBP.

Given that CML cells are usually highly resistant to chemotherapy, novel and more efficacious strategies against this disease are urgently needed. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a set of newly discovered 20-22 nucleotides RNA molecules, and they broadly repress their cognate target genes at post-transcriptional/translational level. Up to date, there are approximately 2,000 human miRNA transcripts have been characterized, which are estimated to modulate more than 30% human genes and are widely involved in many essential biological processes including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and also tumorigenesis. In this study, we studied let-7, a miRNA with tumor suppressive signature, for its therapeutic potential in CML. When treating CML K562 and KU812 cell by imatinib, let-7 can be significantly induced. Overexpression of let-7 can sensitize K562 and KU812 cells to imatinib, while knock-down of let-7 can increase the drug resistance of these cells. The mechanistic studies found that let-7 was able to promote apoptosis of CML cells, inhibit the tumor cell proliferation, and lead to a cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. These results demonstrate that let-7 is a potential target for treating CML by imatinib and/or other anti-cancer druges.

This disruption of trans-auto phosphorylation exacts its activity via the coiled-coil domain in BCR, but leads to an overall similar effect as TKIs - induction of apoptosis and reduction in proliferation. Here we detail the results of this peptide (delivered as a gene and transcribed in vitro) in combination with small molecule or biologic agents.

All assays were performed in BCR-ABL expressing K562 cells in vitro. Western blots confirming knockdown of the autophagy gene ATG7, Alox5, and MUC-1 using shRNA were carried out.

It has revolutionized the treatment of early stage or chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Unfortunately, a proportion of CP patients experience suboptimal responses to BCR-ABL TKIs, and progress to blast crisis (BC) stage of CML with poor survival rate. A potential cause of the resistance to TKI is the elevated level of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which has been found to be a consistent feature in patient-derived BC-CML samples. Importantly, both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that the MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1/2) phosphorylate eIF4E on Ser209, and that the overexpression of eIF4E drives oncogenesis in a variety of cancers including BC-CML. Furthermore, several reports have indicated that eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser209, as well as eIF4E overexpression, is critical to tumor progression.We found that a BC-CML cell line, K562, that expresses a serine to alanine phospho-mutant at position 209 of eIF4E, shows reduced ability to form tumors in mice compared to wildtype eIF4E. In addition, our recent work has demonstrated the importance of the MNK-eIF4E axis in activating BC leukemia stem cell (LSC) function (Lim et al., PNAS18; 110(25)', 'E2298-307, 2013). These data highlight the critical importance of MNK1/2-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation in cancer progression and maintenance, and suggests that inhibition of MNK1/2 is an attractive therapeutic approach to treat BC-CML. Consequently, we set out to identify selective inhibitors of the MNK1/2 kinases to treat BC-CML patients.Here, we report our hit finding strategy, as well as our hit to lead optimization process. Results describing structure activity relationships, pharmacokinetics properties, and biochemical characteristics of a highly specific MNK1/2 inhibitor, are presented. Our data demonstrate that drug-like molecules can be developed to potently and specifically inhibit the MNK kinases. We also show that simultaneous inhibition of MNK and BCR-ABL is effective at inhibiting BCR-ABL-driven growth and proliferation, as well as inhibiting the MNK-eIF4E-dependent self-renewal function of BC-LSCs.

Following allogeneic stem cell transplantation the majority (10/12) AML patients reconstituted anti-phosphopeptide immunity. In some cases dramatic expansions, of similar magnitude to cytomegalovirus responses, were observed approaching 1% of CD8 T cells for a single phosphopeptide epitope. In CLL, none of whom were transplanted, we found that over the study period of 12 months that among the patients with anti-phosphopeptide immunity only 1 of 5 patients required treatment compared to 4 of 9 patients requiring treatment where no anti phosphopeptide responses were seen (2=NS). Importantly, ex vivo expanded phosphopeptide specific T cells isolated from both healthy individuals and patients post-transplant were able to kill both HLA-matched primary leukemia samples and AML cell lines in a phosphopeptide-specific manner.

However, little information is available about functional involvement of lncRNAs in tumorigenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) induced by Bcr-Abl oncogene. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in human CML cells using an lncRNA cDNA microarray combined with drug treatment. We identified an lncRNA termed lncRNA-up38 that was critically involved in Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. We found that expression of lncRNA-up38 was greatly upregulated by inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase activity in K562 cells and leukemic cells derived from CML patients. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrated that lncRNA-up38 acted as a key regulator of 4EBP1 functioning during Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. Moreover, silencing lncRNA-up38 promoted leukemic cells survival and enhanced Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis, whereas forced expression of lncRNA-up38 sensitized leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis and inhibited Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Additionally, our experiments have begun to address the mechanism of how lncRNA-up38 is regulated in the leukemic cells and showed that Bcr-Abl repressed lncRNA-up38 expression through c-Myc-dependent signaling. Taken together, these results reveal that Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation is associated with downregulation of tumor-suppressor lncRNA-up38 and suggest a potential strategy for the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia.']",

        "Background":"['The T315I gatekeeper mutation confers resistance to majority of approved ABL1 inhibitors, with only ponatinib demonstrating efficacy in BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven disease. However, vascular adverse events and selection of resistant compound mutations limit its clinical utility. Hence, there is an unmet need for novel therapies for patients with gatekeeper-mutated Ph+ leukemia. In this study we integrated comprehensive drug sensitivity testing with structural analysis to characterize the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a putative novel therapy for BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemias.To address this we profiled BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven CML/Ph+ ALL patient samples against 300 anti-cancer compounds (approved and investigational drugs). Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing of primary cells derived from a Ph+ ALL patient revealed a marked and cancer-selective response to the VEGFR inhibitor axitinib. Strikingly, axitinib exhibited higher sensitivity in T315I positive Ph+ patient samples in comparison to T315I negative CML and ALL patient samples. In line with the ex vivo drug response data, axitinib inhibited the kinase activity of ABL1(T315I) with similar potency as its primary target VEGFR2, while the potency to non-mutated ABL1 was 30-fold lower. Analogously, in engineered Ba/F3 cells, axitinib showed a 10-fold higher inhibition of T315I than non-mutated ABL1-driven autophosphorylation and cell growth. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the BCR-ABL1(T315I) selectivity, we solved the crystal structure of axitinib in complex with ABL1(T315). The structure revealed that axitinib bound to a mutation induced active conformation of ABL1(T315I), different than the binding mode in non-mutated ABL1, likely explaining the increased potency towards ABL1(T315I). Moreover, axitinib occupied a distinct binding space than all approved ABL1 inhibitors, signifying that axitinib will have a unique mutation vulnerability profile. Compassionate two week treatment of a CML patient harboring the T315I mutation with axitinib, resulted in a 5-fold reduction of T315I transcript levels in the bone marrow, further suggesting that axitinib can produce specific and effective responses in patients with BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia.In conclusion, we demonstrate that axitinib potently inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) via a gatekeeper mutant-selective mechanism. Since axitinib is in clinical use for treatment of refractory renal cell carcinoma with a manageable safety profile, our data provide a sound basis for readily repurposing axitinib for BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia. Finally, the distinct mechanism of inhibition by axitinib serves as an exemplar for development of even more effective gatekeeper-mutant selective inhibitors targeting ABL1 as well as other clinically important kinases, such as EGFR and KIT.']",

Moreover, ponatinib induced complete regression of KIT-mutant tumors in a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patient-derived xenograft (PDX), a finding consistent with the preliminary evidence of efficacy observed in pts with refractory GIST (NCT01874665). In this study, we evaluated ponatinib in a panel of PDXs harboring oncogenic variants of RET and FGFR.Methods', ' The efficacy of ponatinib (20 mg/kg once-daily oral dosing) was compared to that of vehicle in 10 PDXs derived from a variety of tumor types containing oncogenic RET or FGFR fusions, high-level FGFR amplification (amp), or no known oncogenic drivers (WT; Table 1).

The Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) represents the standard treatment for CML. However, a number of CML patients develop imatinib resistance and several mechanisms of resistance have been described. While most mutant forms are sensitive to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the T315I mutation remains completely refractory to imatinib, as well as to these agents. Treatment of CML patients harboring T315I mutation is still an unmet medical need in the imatinib and post-imatinib era. We have identified P2745, a novel orally bioavailable small molecule that is effective in imatinib resistant mutations and particularly T315I mutation form to address this unmet medical need. In vitro P2745 showed potent cytotoxicity (IC50 0.8-5 M) in twelve Bcr-Abl mutated imatinib resistant cell lines including T315I compared to wild type Bcr-Abl cell lines. P2745 did not show cytotoxicity upto 30 M in normal fibroblasts (MRC-5 and WI-38) and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells thus indicating specificity towards cancerous cells. P2745 inhibited pCrkLTyr207 in imatinib-resistant CML cell lines accompanied with down regulation of Bcr-Abl protein levels. Additionally, it up regulated tumor suppressor protein SMAR-1 which resulted in negative regulation TGF-/SMAD-dependent pathway as demonstrated by low phosphorylated levels of SMAD2 and SMAD3, two key players implicated in the preservation of the malignant progenitor population, and partly responsible for the resistance to treatments targeting Bcr-Abl. P2745 also induced significant apoptosis in imatinib resistant cell lines (Y253F, T315I and E255V) but not in normal MRC-5 cell line. In addition, like imatinib it induced 80-90 % apoptosis in cells derived from CML patients. In vivo studies demonstrated significant (p<0.001), dose dependent efficacy in imatinib resistant T315I cells xenograft in SCID mice. It also demonstrated significant in vivo efficacy in Bcr-Abl wild type imatinib sensitive K-562 (p<0.05) and Ba/F3 (p<0.001) xenografts in SCID mice. PK-PD evaluation in imatinib resistant xenograft experiments indicated that at the efficacious dose, P2745 modulated proteins responsible for CML pathogenesis (60-80 %), which correlates with the levels of P2745 in the tumors.

Despite strong initial responses to these drugs, many patients acquire resistance over time through acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations such as T315I, compound BCR-ABL mutations or through BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms. Even though the next generation pan-ABL inhibitor, Ponatinib, targets all know resistant ABL mutations, some patients don't benefit from Ponatinib and in these cases resistance to TKI therapy may be due to BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms. We analyzed the mechanism of ABL-TKI-dual-resistant CML cells independent of new BCR-ABL mutations and tested the sensitivity of these resistant cells to the PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941 and/or the MEK inhibitor GDC-0973.Methods\", ' We created ABL-TKI-dual-resistant cells and clones through prolonged treatment of K562 and KCL22 cells with Imatinib and then Dasatinib.

These resistant cells and clones had acquired new somatic mutations in p53, BRCA2, PTEN, RB, SMARCA4 and PBRM1, but not in BCR-ABL. Phosphoprotein profiling showed low phosphorylation of the BCR-ABL substrates c-ABL, SHC and FAK indicative of BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of resistance. Activity of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways varied across the resistant clones. However, high levels of the AKT substrate, FOXO-1 directly correlated with Dasatinib resistance and with GDC-0941 sensitivity. Sensitivity to GDC-0941 also correlated with modulation of phospho-FOXO-1.

A pilot next-generation sequencing study identified kinase activating alterations in 15 Ph-like ALL cases. The goals of this study were to define the genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL in children and young adults, and to examine the utility of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients harboring genetic alterations activating kinase signaling.We studied 1665 B-ALL cases, including 309 childhood standard risk (10.8% Ph-like), 826 childhood high risk (14% Ph-like), 370 adolescent (16-21 years, 21% Ph-like) and 160 young adult (21-39 years; 26% Ph-like) cases. Approximately 50% of Ph-like cases harbored a CRLF2 rearrangement (IGH-CRLF2 or P2RY8-CRLF2). Next-generation sequencing was performed for 160 non-CRLF2 expressing Ph-like cases, including mRNA-seq (141 cases), whole genome sequencing (30 cases) and/or exome sequencing (12 cases). Fusion transcripts were identified using CICERO, a novel mRNA-seq assembly-based structural variation detection method.Over 100 chimeric in-frame fusions were identified, including 29 involving 12 tyrosine kinase or cytokine receptor genes, 15 of which were recurrent', ' JAK2 (10 partners), ABL1 (6), ABL2 (3), PDGFRB (3), CSF1R, TYK2, NTRK3, PTK2B, IL2RB (1 partner each), and rearrangements of EPOR into the IGH and IGK loci. Together, these rearrangements were present in 30% of Ph-like ALL cases. Additional sequence and structural alterations activating kinase signaling were identified in 10% of cases (e.g IL7R, FLT3, SH2B3).Despite the diversity of kinase alterations, the majority are predicted to respond to a limited number of TKIs, but many are novel or have not been tested in suitable preclinical models of ALL. We show that expression of RCSD1-ABL1, RANBP2-ABL1, ZMIZ1-ABL1, RCSD1-ABL2, SSBP2-CFS1R and PAX5-JAK2 in Ba/F3 and primary mouse pre-B cultures induces cytokine-independent proliferation and constitutive activation of JAK/STAT signaling. Furthermore, the ABL1, ABL2 and CSF1R fusions were sensitive to dasatinib (IC50 range 1-2nM), whilst PAX5-JAK2 only responded to the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib.

Targeted BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as Imatinib, and the second generation TKIs like Nilotinib as well as the dual specific SCR and ABL inhibitor Dasatinib have significantly slowed disease progression by eradicating the bulk of BCR-ABL1 expressing cells in the circulation. However, progression to a therapeutically resistant blast crisis (BC) phase is driven by CD34+CD38+Lin- progenitors that co-opt stem cell properties, such as enhanced self-renewal and survival, albeit in a deregulated manner. These BC leukemia stem cells (BC LSC) harbor enhanced BCL2 and beta-catenin expression. Seminal research shows that a key Wnt/beta-catenin target gene, CD44, plays a vital role in cancer stem cell survival and retention in the malignant microenvironment. Because alternative mRNA splicing in humans generates many CD44 isoforms, we investigated CD44 variant expression and retention of human BC LSC in specific hematopoietic niches.Methods and ResultsWe performed whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) of FACS sorted progenitors (Lin-CD34+CD38+) from chronic phase (CP)(n=8) and blast crisis (BC)(n=8) CML patients as well as from normal cord blood (CB) (n=7) and adult peripheral blood (NPB)(n=4). A number of CD44 transcript variants were detected', ' 3, 4 (CD44s), 5, 6, 7, 8 plus additional variants. RNA seq analysis uncovered a higher overall CD44 expression in BC compared to CP progenitors. Notably, one isoform of CD44, variant 3, was highly upregulated in BC compared to CP progenitors and minimally expressed by their normal counterparts. Moreover, BC progenitors that engrafted in RAG2-/-c-/- harbored CD44v3 expression in the bone marrow and the splenic niche and this differential BC LSC isoform expression was reduced after dasatinib treatment. In addition, BC LSC in the spleen showed a reduction of migration specific markers, such as RHAMM, ICAM-1 and Osteopontin, compared with the bone marrow resident BC LSC. Furthermore, a comparative splice isoform specific qRT-PCR analysis of CD44 variants expression in young versus old bone marrow showed no correlation with aging. In fact, human embryonic stem cells harbored variant 3 expression.ConclusionsThese data suggest that CD44 transcript variant 3 upregulation occurs following malignant reprogramming of hematopoietic progenitors that enables them to adopt features of an embryonic transcriptional program in select microenvironments. Detection of CD44 variant 3 has the potential to more precisely identify patients at risk for relapse and progression, suggest that combined therapeutic strategies involving a BCR-ABL specific TKI and a CD44 monoclonal antibody may decrease relapse and BC transformation rates.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is invariably associated with the expression of the p210 Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Although the Abl-encoded tyrosine kinase activity is important for leukemogenesis, the emerging problems of acquired resistance and minimal residual disease highlight the need for new complementary targets for pharmacological intervention. In our previous studies, we had identified a non-classical ubiquitin binding domain (UBD) within the NH2-terminal of p210 Bcr-Abl. Deletion of the UBD (p210 Bcr-Abl(UBD)) impairs the interaction between p210 Bcr-Abl and p--catenin (ser33). Over-expression of p210 Bcr-Abl, but not p210 Bcr-Abl(UBD), leads to an accumulation of phosphorylated -catenin, and at least two of its known transcriptional targets, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. The interaction between p210 Bcr-Abl and -catenin is ubiquitination dependent. -catenin is a central component of the Wnt pathway which plays a critical role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model for CML, mice transplanted with hematopoietic cells that express p210 Bcr-Abl(UBD) have significantly increased life spans compared to mice transplanted with p210 Bcr-Abl expressing cells. Delayed disease progression is associated with decreased levels of -catenin, and reduced numbers of granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs), in the bone marrow. Deletion of UBD also impairs the transplantability of CML cells. Based on these observations we propose a model in which p210 Bcr-Abl may influence the Wnt signaling pathway, and leukemic expansion, by binding ubiquitinated -catenin, and stabilizing it against degradation. Stabilized -catenin leads to increased self-renewal of CML stem cells and progenitors. Importantly, this activity is contained within Bcr sequences, and is independent of tyrosine kinase activity.']",

However therapy resistance in a significant proportion of patients remains a severe clinical problem. Aside mutations of the BCR/ABL gene, regulation of cellular transporters or downstream factors may contribute to non-response. We aimed to investigate micro-RNA expression profiles in peripheral leukocytes of 21 newly diagnosed CML patients without BCR/ABL-mutations in order to identify biomarkers to treatment-response of imatinib. Methods', ' Ten responders (molecular remission) and 11 non-responders were included. Expression of 667 microRNAs was analyzed using a TaqMan Low-Density Array system. Relative fold change of microRNAs between groups was calculated according to the 2^-Ct method. MicroRNAs with a fold change>2 and a P-value<0.01 were considered significant. MicroRNAs with minor expression (Ct-value>20) were not included. Putative targets of dysregulated microRNAs were considered, if predicted by at least three databases, and further analyzed using the DAVID-bioinformatic database. Results', ' Four microRNAs were significantly deregulated (miR-7, miR-744*, miR-616, miR-212) between responders and non-responders, when being treatment-nave, predicted to have 97 potential targets. In depth target analysis showed that transcription regulators (21% of the predicted targets) are highly enriched compared to normal gene expression background of humans. Pathway analysis revealed six genes involved in cancer pathways, whereas four of them are directly involved in the chronic myeloid leukemia pathway (SMAD4, NRAS, RB1, RAF1). In responders seven microRNAs were deregulated before and after therapy, whereas five other microRNAs were deregulated within the group of non-responders. Three deregulated microRNAs were identified in both groups. Most predicted target genes are involved in MAPK signaling and exocytosis, 13% of the targets were predicted to be transcription regulators, and 18% cellular (especially uptake) transporters. Conclusion', ' We identified distinct microRNA pattern comparing blood samples of responders and non-responders prior to imatinib therapy. Predicted target genes were primarily transcription factors and oncogenes. In contrast, transporters and exocytotic pathways are in addition frequent targets of microRNAs deregulated after imatinib therapy. The suitability as biomarkers for prediction of imatinib-response requires further confirmation.']",

        "Background":"['The t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome translocation fuses the BCR gene to the c-ABL proto-oncogene resulting in a chimeric BCR/ABL protein. Although BCR/ABL inhibitor imatinib has shown unprecedented efficacy for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), resistance to this agent due to BCR/ABL mutations or increased protein expression poses a significant clinical problem, thereby arguing for novel therapeutic approaches. BCR/ABL gene amplification frequently occurs in blast crisis and BCR/ABL expression is required for its mutation. BCR promoter contains Sp1 binding sites and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BORT) disrupts Sp1 transactivation, therefore, we hypothesized that BORT could abolish BCR/ABL expression leading to disrupted kinase activity. However, the fast clearance and the inability to reach target cells in vivo have limited its application. As such, we designed a liposomal BORT (L-BORT) and transferrin receptor (TfR)-targeted L-BORT (Tf-L-BORT) for the objective of enhancing BORT delivery efficiency. We observed that there were 3.6-fold and 10.4-fold increases in cellular uptake of L-BORT and Tf-L-BORT, respectively, compared to that of the free drug. We evidenced a 2.7-fold augmented chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX) in cells exposed to subtoxic concentration of BORT, with a decrease in IC50 from 8 M to 300 nM. Tf-L-BORT further reduced IC50 of DOX to 90 nM. These data indicated the enhanced chemosensitizing efficacy of the L-BORT formulations. When single tumor cells from K562 tumor bearing mice were treated by subtoxic L-BORT combined with DOX, a synergy of toxicity was evidenced by 70-fold increased chemosensitivity (p<0.05). Tf-L-BORT was more effective in chemosensitizing tumor single cells than L-BORT, with decreased IC50 of DOX to 94 nM. Pharmacokinetic study in mice after i.v. bolus injection showed that L-BORT had slower tissue distribution (T1/2, 7.3 min vs. 2.9 min), increased elimination phase half-life (T1/2, 82.9 h vs. 68.3 h), decreased clearance (CL, 4.2 mL/h vs. 27.7 mL/h), and increased area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC, 4714.1 hng/mL vs. 721.4 hng/mL) compared to the free drug. This indicated a significant and potentially beneficial change in BORT pharmacokinetics in vivo. Mechanistically, when K562 cells were exposed to L-BORT (0, 10, 30 and 60nM) or DOX (0, 100, 200 and 500nM) for 48h, BCR/ABL protein was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the combination of L-BORT with DOX synergistically abrogated BCR/ABL and Sp1 protein expression. Altogether, these results highlight the therapeutic relevance of disrupting BCR/ABL protein expression and strongly support the utilization of L-BORT alone or in combination with DOX to treat CML patients harboring overexpressed BCR/ABL.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is diagnosed by abnormal myeloid lineage cell proliferation and the presence of the Bcr-Abl fusion gene encoding abnormal tyrosine kinase. Imatinib mesylate (IM) is the first developed Bcr/Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for the treatment of CML. Despite of high response rates, significant numbers of CML patients develop the resistance against these kinase inhibitors. Deferasirox (DFO) is an oral iron chelating agent that has been used to treat acute iron detoxification and chronically iron overloaded. Recent reports have been shown that iron chelators induce anti-proliferative effect in multiple leukemia cells. However, their roles and underlying mechanism in CML cell lines are not yet fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the combination effects of Deferasirox and Imatinib in CML cell line, and investigated their apoptosis -inducing effects as the potential mechanism in this process. Two CML cell lines (K562, KU812) were treated with various concentrations of Deferasirox, Imatinib and combination of two drugs. The viability and the level of apoptosis of the treated cells will be measured with MTT assay, FACS analysis and western blot. The results showed that both of them induce the growth inhibitory effects in dose and Time dependent fashion in both CML cell lines. Cell cycle analysis by FACS indicated that cell lines treated with combination therapy showed an increase in the proportion of cells in sub-G1 phase, compared to single treatment cell lines. Exposure of CML cells to IM/DFO also resulted in the increase in the percentage of annexin V-positive and PI-negative cells. The results by multiple in vitro experimental model, showed that IM/DFO induce CML cells to undergo apoptosis with the activation of caspase9 and 3, the cleavage of PARP and reduced significantly in parallel with BCR/ABL phosphorylation compared with treatment with IM or DFO alone. Importantly, inhibition of NF-kB activity demonstrated that IM/DFO-induced apoptotic pathway was regulated by the NF-kB signaling cascade. To determine the effect of IM/DFO on NF-B transcriptional activity, a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter regulated by NF-B cis-acting elements was used. The results showed that IM/DFO decreased NF-B transcriptional activity in K562 and KU812 cells, respectively, compared to single treated cells. IM/DFO regulated the nuclear activation of NF-B. In conclusion, this finding indicates that combination of Imatinib and Deferasirox, promotes apoptosis of CML cells by sequential regulation of the BCR/ABL expression followed by the inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway.']",

        "Background":"['Deletions and dominant-negative mutations in IKZF1, the gene encoding Ikaros transcription factor, are found in 85% of Ph+ B-ALL and in some cases of Ph B-ALL, and are associated with poor prognosis. Genomic studies of high-risk Ph or Ph-like B-ALLs have revealed frequent mutation and activation of TK genes and signaling pathways. While ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as dasatinib and ponatinib have been incorporated into chemotherapy regimens for Ph+ B-ALL, the majority of patients still relapse, which correlates with residual bone marrow disease following induction therapy. New therapeutic strategies are needed for patients with Ikaros-mutant, high-risk Ph+ and Ph B-ALL.Using mice with a conditional Ikzf1 mutation (Ike5fl) that mimics the dominant-negative Ik6 mutant found in human B-ALL, we demonstrated that loss of Ikaros DNA-binding function arrests B-lymphoid development at a large pre-B cell stage that can give rise to B-ALL. Survival and proliferation of Ikaros mutant pre-B cells is dependent on increased integrin-mediated stromal adhesion and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK is a non-receptor TK downstream of integrins and growth factor receptors that plays important roles in cancer stem cell biology and the tumor microenvironment.Here, we show that dysregulated tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL1, cooperate with Ikaros mutation to accelerate the development of B-lymphoblastic leukemia in mice, correlated with a striking (30-fold) increase in the frequency of engrafting leukemia-initiating or leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Ikzf1-mutant BCR-ABL1+ lymphoblasts exhibit relative resistance to ABL1 TKIs including dasatinib that is dependent on the presence of stroma. VS-4718 is a potent, orally bioavailable FAK inhibitor that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in preclinical models, and is currently under evaluation in clinical trials in patients with various solid tumors. VS-4718 treatment abolished stromal adhesion and induced apoptosis of Ikzf1-mutant B-ALL and synergized with dasatinib, but had little effect on Ikzf1 WT B-ALL cells. Primary human Ph+ B-ALL samples showed a correlation between IKZF1 mutation status, stromal adherence, and sensitivity to FAK and ABL inhibitors in vitro, and BM tropism in vivo in xenografted NSG mice. Results from ongoing in vivo therapy experiments will be presented.Together, these results suggest a new model for the pathogenesis of high-risk B-ALL and its resistance to conventional therapy. B-ALLs with IKZF1 mutations may be resistant to TKIs and to chemotherapy by virtue of their stromal adhesion phenotype, resulting in failure to eliminate BM leukemic stem cells. Inhibition of FAK signaling in Ph+ or Ph IKZF1-mutant B-ALL may reverse the stromal-mediated resistance to ABL1 TKIs and/or chemotherapy. FAK inhibitors represent a promising new approach for the treatment of high-risk IKZF1-mutant B-ALL patients.']",

An effective BC-CML therapy will likely have to target the BC-LSC population to ensure long-term disease control.Recent studies have shown the importance of the MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase (MNK1/2)-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) axis in sustaining BC-LSC self-renewal. Thus, a single agent which inhibits both BCR-ABL and MNK1/2 kinase simultaneously represents a rational approach to target BC-LSCs.

We recently showed that TRAIL is able to target leukemia stem cell surrogates (Blood 2012,119,4224). Here we tested the ability of TRAIL to target cell cycle arrested tumor cells.Primary tumor cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were amplified in immuno-compromised mice and used for in vitro knockdown studies, besides tumor cell lines. Cell cycle arrest was induced in G0, G1 or G2 using cytotoxic drugs, phase-specific inhibitors or RNA interference against cyclinB and E. Cell cycle was visualized by flowcytometry analysis including phosphorylation of Serine 10 in Histone H3 to discriminate G2 from M phase.Biochemical or molecular arrest at any point of the cell cycle increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis, independently from the tumor cell type, the cell cycle inhibitor used or the check point addressed. In contrast, when cell cycle arrest was disabled by addition of caffeine, the anti-tumor activity of TRAIL was reduced. Most importantly for clinical translation, tumor cells from three children with B-precursor or T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis upon knockdown of either cyclinB or cyclinE arresting the cell cycle in G2 or G1, respectively.Taken together and in contrast to most conventional cytotoxic drugs, TRAIL exerts enhanced anti-tumor activity against cell cycle arrested tumor cells.

We hypothesize that this protection is in part mediated by adipocytes alleviating oxidative stress in ALL cells.Murine pre-B ALL cells isolated from a BCR/ABL transgenic mouse (8093) and human leukemia cell lines (BV173, Nalm6, REH, SEM, RS4;11, HL60, and Molt4) were used. The ALL cells were co-cultured with 3T3-L1 adipocytes using a transwell system. Cells were collected for gene expression analysis using qPCR. Intracellular ROS was measured by flow cytometry with 2-7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH-DA). Four of the six human leukemia cell lines tested were protected by adipocytes against DNR treatment. Western blots showed that DNR induced a significant increase in the cleaved to procaspase-3 ratio, which was reversed by ALCM (No drug', ' 0.240.2, DNR', ' 0.830.14, ALCM+DNR', ' 0.240.19; p = 0.004 for DNR vs. ALCM+DNR, n = 4). Expression of the oxidative stress response genes gclc, gclm and p21 was upregulated in 8093 cells upon DNR treatment (fold change over baseline', ' 1.820.37, 2.350.73, 5.551.50; p<0.05, n = 3), while the presence of adipocytes prevented this upregulation (fold change over baseline', ' 0.830.11, 0.880.02, 1.750.57; p<0.05, n = 3). To investigate the oxidative stress induced by DNR, Nalm6 cells were treated with five doses of DNR for 6 hours alone or in the presence of pre-adipocytes or adipocytes. There was a dose-dependent increase in%ROShigh cells regardless of feeder type. At 200nM DNR, there were significantly fewer%ROShigh cells when co-cultured with adipocytes compared to no feeder or pre-adipocytes (p<0.05, n = 3). To test whether alleviating oxidative stress alone would cause DNR resistance, BV173, Nalm6 and REH cells were treated with DNR (100, 200 and 300nM, respectively) or a combination of DNR and the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; 20mM). The addition of NAC significantly protected the cells from DNR (p<0.05, n = 3).These findings demonstrate that adipocytes contribute to drug resistance by alleviating oxidative stress in ALL cells. Further research is required to identify the soluble factors responsible for these protective effects.']",

Clinical management of CML has been revolutionized by imatinib, a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Imatinib selectivity is due in part to its ability to recognize and stabilize the inactive conformation of the kinase domain. This conformation is stabilized by intramolecular binding of the SH3 domain to theSH2-kinase linker, which in turn packs against the back of the kinase domain. Imatinib resistance can be caused by point mutations that either affect drug binding directly (e.g., through mutation of the gatekeeper position, Thr315) or that allosterically disturb the downregulated kinase domain conformation (e.g., through mutation or phosphorylation of the SH3 domain). These observations suggest that strengthening the regulatory SH3', 'linker interaction present inBcr-Abl may stabilize a downregulated kinase domain conformation, thus sensitizing the kinase domain to inhibitor action. To explore this possibility, we created a series of modified c-Abl and Bcr-Abl proteins with enhancedSH3-linker interactions. By systematically increasing the proline content of the linker, we identified high-affinity linkers that stabilized intramolecularSH3 binding without disturbing the overall regulation of the kinase core.Enhanced SH3', 'linker interaction completely reversed c-Abl core activation by aC-lobe myristate binding pocket mutation, and substantially reduced activation by mutations in the ATP binding site (T315I) as well as the SH2', 'C-lobe interface (Y158D).

        "Background":"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the first blood cancer known to originate from a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) by expression of BCR-ABL, a product of the chromosomal translocation t(9;22), that slowly progress to a lethal fast-growing leukemia caused by malignant reprogramming of progenitor cells (blast crisis). Although CML can be successfully managed with targeted therapy by suppressing BCR-ABL kinase activity with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), patients remain in remission as long as they adhere to a lifelong treatment. The leukemic stem cell (LSC) population emerges as a key CML reservoir that escapes TKI therapy by developing BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of self-renewal and survival. LSC still remains an elusive target because of our poor understanding of specific self-renewal mechanisms and inability to selectively eliminate LSC without damaging normal hematopoiesis. Thus, there is a need for alternative drugs for relapse patients to prevent reactivation of BCR-ABL-positive LSC after stopping chemotherapy or emergence of chemoresistance and as frontline therapy to achieve treatment-free remission. We found that somatic deletion of the transcriptional factor Krppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in BCR-ABL(p210)-induced CML severely impaired disease maintenance. This inability to sustain CML in the absence of KLF4 was caused by attrition of LSCs in bone marrow and the spleen and impaired ability of LSCs to recapitulate leukemia in secondary recipients. This data suggest that KLF4 promotes self-renewal of LSCs whereas serial transplantation indicates that KLF4 restricts stress self-renewal of normal HSCs and thus inhibition of KLF4 function would impair LSC self-renewal without altering blood production. Analyses of global gene expression in purified LSCs and genome-wide binding of KLF4 in a murine CML cell line revealed that KLF4 represses the gene encoding for the dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2). Immunoblots revealed elevated levels of DYRK2 protein in KLF4-deficient LSCs purified from the bone marrow of CML mice. Because phosphorylation of c-Myc and p53 by DYRK2 induces proteosomal degradation and cell death, respectively, we found that DYRK2 upregulation in KLF4-deficient LSCs was associated with a reduction of c-Myc protein and increased cleavage of PARP. As a proof-of-principle of the therapeutic potential of this finding, we explored the efficacy of vitamin K3 to eradicate LSCs by inhibiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase SIAH2 in charge of DYRK2 degradation. Vitamin K3 efficiently reduced cell viability in a panel of human-derived CML cell lines by inducing Dyrk2 expression and apoptosis. The identification of Dyrk2 as a critical mediator of LSC downfall is an innovative paradigm poised to support the development of LSC-specific therapy to induce treatment-free remission in CML patients.']",

CML progresses from an initial chronic phase, through an accelerated phase, to a final and fatal blast crisis. Current first-line therapy for CML involves tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinibs. However, TKIs don't completely cure CML, as revealed by low complete molecular response rate and frequent disease relapse upon drug withdrawal. Studies of patient samples and mouse models indicate that this most likely results from lack of dependence of CML stem cells (CML-SCs) on BCR-ABL for survival. It is important to further identify potential targets of CML-SC. Shp2 is a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase involed in RTK, cytokine, and integrine signaling pathways, and is a target of Abl kinase during cell proliferation. It is required for survival and maintenance of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In the context of CML, BCR-ABL constitutively phosphorylates Gab2, which then binds to Shp2, resulting in its inappropriate activation of downstream pathways, including the Ras-Erk cascade. Gab2 is required for CML initiation in vivo. We hypothesized that Shp2 is required for CML development from the stem cell level and might be an effective target for treatment of CML. Using our induced Shp2 deletion tools, we found that Shp2 is required for CML initiation and maintenance in a bone marrow transplant model of CML. Moreover, primitive CML cells undergo elevated cell death upon Shp2 knockout. This implicates Shp2 as a potential target for CML therapy in future.\"]",

TKI therapy has largely failed to achieve the same degree of clinical success in other activated kinase-driven malignancies, suggesting that BCR-ABL is relatively unique in its ability to establish a state of oncogene addiction.Results', ' To dissect the mechanism by which BCR-ABL coordinates STAT5 and RAS/ERK signaling to establish a state of oncogene addiction, JAK2 kinase activity and RAS-GTP levels were assessed in the CML patient-derived cell line K562. Surprisingly, basal levels of RAS-GTP were low and JAK2 kinase activity was not detectable. Treatment of K562 cells with erythropoietin (EPO) only very modestly activated JAK2. Similarly, EPO treatment after one hour of BCR-ABL inhibition also failed to rescue STAT5 or RAS/ERK activation. However, with more prolonged BCR-ABL kinase inhibition, we observed a time-dependent increase in the ability of EPO to rescue STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation. After 24hrs of BCR-ABL inhibition, EPO treatment led to a significant increase in both JAK2 activation and the GTP loading of RAS relative to vehicle treated cells. These data suggest that BCR-ABL kinase activity hampers the ability of JAK2 to activate STAT5 and RAS/MAPK . Further, 24hr treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 allowed for a comparable degree of EPO-mediated JAK2 activation, suggesting that the negative regulation of JAK2 is mediated at least in part by a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism. These observations were subsequently validated in an isogenic system utilizing TF-1 cells. Similar to the EPO/JAK2 axis in K562 cells, TF1-BCR-ABL cells exhibit attenuated GM-CSF signaling relative to control TF1-puro cells, which was restored only after prolonged BCR-ABL inhibition. Significantly, we have observed that BCR/ABL-expressing cells irreversibly commit to apoptosis before growth factor signaling is fully restored.Conclusions', ' Our data suggest that BCR-ABL-mediated oncogene addiction is a consequence of a high level of physiologic negative feedback mechanisms that dampen growth factor receptor signaling. Our findings also help reconcile recent evidence that JAK2 inhibition restores the sensitivity of CML stem/progenitor cells to ABL TKI treatment in vitro with the observation that JAK2 is completely dispensable for BCR-ABL-induced myeloid disease in mice.']",

Moreover, imatinib resistance frequently occurs in CML patients. Thus, unraveling autophagy regulation in CML and its role in overcoming imatinib resistance has substantial therapeutic benefits not only for CML but also for other cancers that can be treated by imatinib. In this report, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference screen in K562 human CML cells using monodansylcadaverine (MDC) that marks autolysosomes followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to label and isolate autophagic cells. We have identified 336 candidate genes, knockdown of which significantly increased MDC fluorescence. Our further validation utilized Cyto-IDTM Green dye that selectively stains autophagy vacuoles and quantitative RT-PCR that measures knockdown efficiency of shRNAs. We have uncovered a set of genes acting as autophagy mediators in K562 cells. To study their role in imatinib resistance, we measured the effect of imatinib in combination with the knocking down of autophagy mediators. Our results showed that the shRNA of VAMP7, a pivotal factor in vesicle transportation, substantially sensitized K562 cells to imatinib. Intriguingly, our further work revealed that depletion of VAMP7 blocked the activity of key autophagy suppressors AKT and mTOR, suggesting that VAMP7 and perhaps other autophagy mediators regulate imatinib sensitivity through signaling pathways that inhibit autophagy. In conclusion, a set of genes revealed by a genome-wide RNA interference screen mediates autophagy in CML cells and, more importantly, some of these genes render CML cells resistant to imatinib thereby becoming appealing drug targets.']",

Clinical management of CML has been revolutionized by imatinib, a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Despite the clinical success of imatinib in the chronic stage of CML, it is less effective in advanced disease due to the emergence of drug resistance often caused by point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain. Recently, we demonstrated that introduction of the gatekeeper resistance mutation T315I into a recombinant c-Abl core protein enhanced basal kinase activity. Imatinib selectivity is achieved in part by binding and stabilizing the unique inactive conformation of the Abl kinase domain. This conformation is stabilized allosterically by intramolecular binding of the SH3 domain to the SH2-kinase linker, which in turn docks against the back of the kinase domain. The goal of this project, therefore, was to determine whether kinase activation induced by T315I, as well as a mutation in a recently described allosteric inhibitor binding site in the kinase domain C-lobe (A356N mutant), could be overcome by enhancing the SH3', 'linker interaction. For these experiments, we engineered nine High Affinity Linker (HAL) variants of Abl in which SH3', 'linker interaction was tightened through sequential addition of proline residues to the linker. Enhanced SH3', 'linker interaction was confirmed by analysis of SH3 dynamics using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.

To determine the impact of the HAL sequences on activating mutations in the kinase domain, the strongest HAL sequence was combined with the T315I and A356N mutations. Remarkably, the HAL substitution completely reversed Abl core activation by the A356N mutation, and partially reversed the effect of T315I. We next introduced the HAL sequence into p210 Bcr-Abl coding region (wild-type and T315I), and expressed these forms of Bcr-Abl along with matched controls in the human myeloid cell line, TF-1. The Bcr-Abl HAL mutants transformed TF-1 cells to a cytokine-independent phenotype as effectively as wild-type Bcr-Abl but were much more sensitive to induction of apoptosis by the allosteric inhibitor, GNF-2. Furthermore, TF-1 cells transformed with Bcr-Abl-HAL bearing a wild-type kinase domain also showed greater sensitivity to imatinib and the related inhibitor nilotinib, suggesting that enhanced SH3', 'linker interaction structures the kinase domain in a favorable conformation for drug action.

Currently, small molecule therapeutics that target the tyrosine kinase domain (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs) are administered as the gold standard treatment for CML. However, evidence shows that the acquisition of mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain against these small molecules is inevitable, rendering many of the therapeutics useless against mutated forms of Bcr-Abl. The most recently discovered TKI, ponatinib (AP24534), has shown to combat nearly all of the commonly seen mutations, including the previously uncontrollable T315I mutation. But, ponatinib is not without limitations, as it has been shown to cause dose-dependent pancreatitis and thrombocytopenia as adverse side effects. While many small molecules have been created to target the tyrosine kinase domain, our recent work has shown that disruption of Bcr-Abl oligomerization can also induce apoptosis and decrease the oncogenic potential of the disease. This work was done using a modified coiled-coil domain, termed CCmut3, which was rationally designed and mutated to bind to the endogenous Bcr-Abl coiled-coil domain, inhibiting oligomerization and thus preventing Bcr-Abl signaling. The purpose of this work is to exploit a dual-hit approach to inhibit Bcr-Abl using two therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. Here, we show that combining CCmut3 with ponatinib not only increases the potency of the therapy but also lowers the required therapeutic dose of ponatinib in vitro using K562 cells (Bcr-Abl-positive, human CML cells). Western blot analysis shows that both Bcr-Abl phosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream signaling targets STAT5 and CrkL can be decreased using the combination at a ponatinib dose of 100 pM. In addition, transformative ability (via colony forming assay) very significantly declines when using a 1 nM dose in combination as opposed to simply administering 1 nM ponatinib only. Finally, caspase 3/7, 7AAD, and DNA segmentation assays were performed to show enhanced apoptosis induction upon combination treatment when compared with either CCmut3 or ponatinib treatment alone. Currently, this combination is being tested in a Bcr-Abl-positive Ba/F3 cell line containing the T315I mutation in the Abl tyrosine kinase domain.

        "Background":"['CNDAC, the active form of sapacitabine, is a nucleoside analog which kills cells by a unique mechanism of action. Incorporation of CNDAC triphosphate into DNA results in a single-strand break, which is converted to a one-ended double-strand break (DSB) upon subsequent collapse of the DNA replication fork. CNDAC-induced DSBs are repaired predominantly through the homologous recombination pathway which consists the key recombinase Rad51 and its associated proteins. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm; its central pathogenesis is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This abnormal chromosomal fusion results in the formation of a chimeric gene that encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, Bcr-Abl, which promotes CML through stimulating downstream signaling cascades for cell survival and deregulated cell growth. Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase modulates DNA repair mechanisms to protect leukemic cells from DNA damage induced cell death. In response to DSBs, it phosphorylates Rad51 at Tyr315 which enhance the damage repair process. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that inhibition of Bcr-Abl will further sensitize cells to CNDAC. To test this postulate, we used the CML cell line K562 as well as murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with wild-type Bcr-Abl (Ba/F3p210wt) or the Bcr-Abl mutant (Ba/F3p210T315I) as model systems. Two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) were utilized to inhibit Bcr-Abl. Imatinib, the first generation TKI, is only effective inhibiting wild type Bcr-Abl. Ponatinib, a subsequent TKI, is potent in inhibiting both wild type and mutant Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinases. First, these cells were treated with CNDAC, imatinib or ponatinib alone to determine the IC50 values for each drug using PrestoBlue cell viability assay. Based on the single drug IC50s, combinations of CNDAC with imatinib or ponatinib were applied to these cell lines and their combination indexes were calculated by CalcuSyn software. We found that CNDAC and imatinib were synergistic in K562 and Ba/F3 wild type Bcr-Abl cells while they were additive in the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant cells. In contrast, ponatinib sensitized CNDAC treatment as their combination was synergistic in all these cell lines. Finally, to investigate the mechanism underlying the observed synergism, K562 cells were treated with either equitoxic concentrations of CNDAC, imatinib or ponatinib alone or in combinations for 48 hours when lysates were collected for immunoblot analysis. It was found that when Bcr-Abl was inhibited, the phosphoryation of Rad51 at Tyr315 was reduced, phospho H2AX and cleaved caspase 3 were increased in response to CNDAC. Thus further sensitization of CNDAC was a result of deficient damage repair due to Bcr-Abl inhibition. Together, our results link the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase to CNDAC-induced DNA damage repair process and provide rationale for CNDAC/sapacitabine combination therapy in diseases such as CML.']",

Combined treatment had little effect on T210 phosphorylation of PLK1, but clearly reduced S137 phospho-PLK1 without changing PLK1 expression. While the agents alone had little effect on BCR/ABL phosphorylation, combined treatment induced modest reductions in phospho-BCR/ABL but not total expression. Exposure of cells to BI2536 alone induced marked G2M arrest, whereas vorinostat co-administration abrogated this effect. PLK1 shRNA knockdown significantly increased HDACI lethality, whereas HDAC 1-3 shRNA knockdown reciprocally increased BI2536-induced apoptosis.

Under this grouping, the various forms of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma have been classified into more than 60 distinct disease types, each having particular clinical features and disease outcomes. Among these diseases, curative treatments with high long-term survival rate have been developed for some, e.g. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, while such effective regimens are still unavailable for many others, e.g. Multiple Myeloma and Acute Myeloid Leukemia. In this study, a panel of antibodies was raised against SLAMF7, a cell surface marker that was associated to Multiple Myeloma. Among the antibodies, TAG-HC2 was surprisingly found to have preferential binding to SLAMF7 expressed on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cell lines instead. Characterization of TAG-HC2 revealed that the binding of TAG-HC2 to SLAMF7 requires the N-glycosylation of the antigen. Functionally, TAG-HC2 does not have non-specific binding to normal cell lines when tested via flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. TAG-HC2, when complexed with saporin-conjugated secondary mAb, was able to internalize into and kill AML cell lines. These results suggest that TAG-HC2 has the potential to be developed into an Antibody Drug Conjugate against AML.']",

        "Background":"['Imatinib is a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor and the most used drug in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). MYC (c-Myc) is a transcription factor frequently deregulated in human cancer that exerts multiple biological activities, including differentiation inhibition. We found that MYC expression is higher in bone marrow cells form CML patients at diagnosis, as compared with healthy controls. Moreover, high MYC levels at diagnosis correlated with a poorer response to imatinib treatment. One of the major characteristics of CML progression is the loss of cell differentiation. We showed that low concentrations of imatinib induce erythroid differentiation in the CML-derived K562 cell line. We have studied the effect of MYC on the differentiation induced by imatinib using K562 sublines carrying inducible (by zinc cation) or activable (by 4-hydoxy-tamoxifen) MYC alleles. In both cell lines, MYC largely prevented the erythroid differentiation induced by imatinib. The differentiation inhibition mediated by MYC is not due to increased proliferation of MYC-expressing cells or enhanced apoptosis of differentiated cells in the presence of MYC. We previously reported that p27/Kip1 (p27) overexpression induces erythroid differentiation in K562. Thus, we explored the effect of imatinib on p27 levels and we found that imatinib up-regulated p27 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated silencing of p27 antagonized the erythroid differentiation induced by imatinib, indicating that p27 up-regulation is at least in part responsible for differentiation. MYC abrogated the imatinib-induced up-regulation of p27KIP1 concomitantly with the differentiation inhibition, suggesting that MYC inhibits imatinib-mediated differentiation of K562 cells by antagonizing p27 up-regulation. We previously reported that MYC induced SKP2, a component of the ubiquitin ligase complex that targets p27 for degradation. MYC was able to induce SKP2 in the presence of imatinib. Thus, MYC-mediated inhibition of the differentiating effect of imatinib in CML cells is in part a consequence of the SKP2 induction of MYC, which in turn would down-regulate p27. The results suggest that, although MYC deregulation does not directly confer resistance to imatinib, it might be a factor that contributes to progression of CML through the inhibition of differentiation.']",

        "Background":"['IntroductionChronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was one of the first malignancies shown to be initiated in hematopoietic stem cells by the BCR-ABL1 oncogene and sustained in blast crisis (BC) by progenitor cells that co-opt stem cell properties and behave like leukemia stem cells (BC LSC). The BCR-ABL fusion oncogene encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy targeting BCR-ABL suppresses CML during the chronic phase (CP), progenitors undergo expansion as a consequence of subsequent genetic and epigenetic alterations that fuel blast crisis (BC) transformation, BC LSC generation and TKI resistance. We have recently shown that adenosine to insoine (A-to-I) RNA editing activity, mediated by the adenosine deaminase acting on dsRNAs ADAR1, is enhanced in BC CML and drives leukemic progression by inducing myeloid progenitor reprogramming and enhancing self-renewal. ADAR1 targets double-stranded RNA hairpin-containing loop structures, such as microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs, by operating through base-pairing with complementary sequences within a mRNA molecule lead to mRNA degradation and gene silencing. Emerging evidence suggests miRNAs alterations introduced at the pri-miRNA or pre-miRNA level by A-to-I editing by ADAR1 may be responsible for broad changes in the transcriptome that drives LSC maintenance. However, the overall change in edited miRNA profiles in CP CML compared with BC progenitors is unclear. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of ADAR1 in driving malignant progression by focusing on its regulation of miRNA expression in CML.Methods and ResultsMicroRNA expression profiles were evaluated in CD34+ cells derived from CP and BC CML patient samples as well as cord blood. MiRNA PCR array (Qiagen) allowed us to identify differentially expressed miRNAs that were subsequently validated by q-PCR with specific primers targeting individual miRNA. We observed the downregulation of 13 miRNA in CML BC compared to CML CP progenitors. Lentiviral overexpression of ADAR1 in CD34+ cord blood cells led to significant downregulation of 17 miRNAs, including members of the let-7 family, and other miRNAs involved in the regulation of self-renewal. Interestingly, BC CD34+ cells showed a miRNA profile similar to that of lentiviral ADAR1 transduced cord blood progenitors. Lentiviral overexpression of ADAR1 in CD34+ chronic phase CML cells, led to a significant downregulation of 14 miRNAs compared with their lentiviral backbone transduced counterparts.ConclusionOur data suggest that ADAR1 contributes to BC LSC generation by downregulating miRNAs that target stem cell regulatory gene products. A further characterization of ADAR-editing related miRNA signatures may enable BC LSC detection and early intervention with combined BCR-ABL1 and ADAR1-targeting strategies that may obviate CML relapse and progression.']",

The objective of this study was to assess cardiac events in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with standard therapy (an anthracycline plus cytarabine or 7+3) versus KIT positive AML patients treated with 7+3 plus nilotinib as part of a clinical trial. Methods', ' After IRB approval, 100 consecutive patients treated for newly diagnosed AML at Mayo Clinic who consented to the use of their medical records for research were identified and a retrospective chart review performed. The primary endpoint was heart failure defined by the modified Framingham criteria. Secondary endpoints included cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) defined as a drop in ejection fraction of > 10% to < 53%, arrhythmias defined as a new rhythm abnormality other than sinus bradycardia or tachycardia resulting in a change to therapy or transfer to a higher level of care, and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) diagnosed by a cardiologist.

Increased understanding of the pathobiology of B-cell ALL has led to risk-targeted treatment regimens and increased survival rates. However, the underlying causes of this pediatric cancer are still unclear. We are using next-generation sequencing technology to better understand the genomic landscape of pre-B ALL and to build a catalogue of variations involved in pediatric ALL onset and/or progression. Using a unique quartet design that involves matched tumor (at diagnosis) and normal (remission) samples, as well as DNA from both parents, we will be able to identify somatic mutations driving the leukemic process. Here, we report the deep-sequencing of the whole exomes, and the partial miRNomes, of over 60 childhood B-cell ALL quartets. Using ABI SOLiD technology, we captured over 4.0 Gb of sequence on average per sample with a mean coverage of 40X. Genome-wide genotyping (Illumina's Omni 2.5 array) was also for quality control and structural variant identification. For each individual, approximately 97% of the targeted region was covered 1X and 80% of the targeted bases passed our thresholds for variant calling ( 5X coverage, MQV  20). According to these criteria, about 25,000 SNPs were found per individual. Using this quartet design we were able to incorporate parental sequence information to reduce sequencing errors and facilitate the identification of true variants within a given family, and of leukemia-specific variants within the ALL cohort. We investigated the somatic mutation profiles of the ALL genomes and identified both recurrent and private leukemia-specific mutations, and highlighted genes/pathways with an increased burden of somatic loss of function variants. Our goal now is to validate potential driver mutations that could play a direct role in leukemogenesis through functional assessment. Ultimately, this work will provide invaluable insights to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying pediatric ALL which could lead to the development of powerful clinical tools to improve detection, diagnosis and treatment of this childhood cancer.\"]",

        "Background":"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in the United States and Europe. Despite recent advance in new therapeutic agents that have improved treatment outcomes, CLL remains incurable. CLL patients with loss of p53 due to unfavorable cytogenetic alterations such as chromosome 17p deletion often exhibit more malignant disease phenotype, are resistant to many standard therapeutic agents, and have poor clinical outcomes. Thus, finding effective treatment for CLL with p53 deficiency represents a significant challenge, and development new agents and therapeutic strategies to effectively kill CLL cells with loss of p53 function would have profound clinical implications in CLL treatment. We have recently created a mouse model with Tcl1-Tg', 'p53-/- genotype that resembles the aggressive human CLL disease with p53 deficiency (17p-deletion). We showed that leukemia cells isolated from this mouse model as well as primary human leukemia cells with 17p deletion isolated from CLL patients are resistant to standard anti-CLL agents. Because p53 plays important roles in regulation of apoptosis and in maintaining mitochondrial function/normal metabolism/redox homeostasis, we hypothesized that a loss of p53 function in CLL with 17p- or p53 mutations would on one hand lead to drug resistance and poor therapeutic response to conventional treatment, and would on the other hand also cause mitochondrial dysfunction and high ROS stress. Our study tested the possibility to use the high oxidative stress as a biochemical basis to effectively target the drug-resistant CLL cells with p53 deletion using redox-modulating strategy in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that ROS-mediating strategies could overcome drug resistance of CLL cells with p53 deficiency, and was able to effectively eliminate fludarabine-resistant CLL cells using phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), which induced rapid glutathione depletion and caused severe ROS accumulation leading to massive death of CLL cells in culture. Importantly, PEITC also exhibited promising in vivo therapeutic activity in the CLL mouse model as a single agent, leading to a significant prolongation of the mouse survival time. Since PEITC is a natural compound found in vegetables with very low toxicity to normal cells, the results of this study may have important therapeutic implications. Our study suggests that PEITC may potentially be used for clinical treatment of CLL with 17p deletion and improve the outcome of this subpopulation of CLL patients, who would otherwise refractory to standard therapeutics.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable accumulation of malignant B-cells in peripheral circulation, which home to supportive leukemic microenvironments. Critical to the pathogenesis of CLL are membrane-associated antigens since they facilitate leukemic cell signaling, microenvironment homing, proliferation, and survival. Targeting these CLL surface molecules is a current focus of CLL therapeutic development. Rituximab, alemtuzumab, and ofatumumab are commonly used antibody-based therapeutics that proved to be effective at targeting CLL membrane associated antigens. Despite enhanced patient survival, targeting of non-obligate antigens ultimately leads to antibody resistance. In addition, off target expression often produces unacceptable toxicity. Immunosurveilance antigens may provide a key to overcome these obstacles. A number of relevant tumor antigens such as p53, EGFR, WT1, BCR-Abl and ROR1 elicit robust autoimmune responses in cancer patients due to high levels of ectopic expression, high relative immunogenicity and obligate oncogenic signaling that forces expression despite autoimmune recognition. In many cases, autoantibody signatures were realized long after identification of the oncologic target antigens; however, the convergence of these two datasets implies that such signatures could be utilized to identify novel targets. To further explore this possibility, we interrogated anti-tumor humoral reactivity specifically directed against autologous CLL membrane antigens. Immunoreactive leads were identified by mass spectrometry. Potential membrane antigens were further confirmed using immunoblot and ELISA. Our analysis revealed Lymphocyte Cytosolic Protein 1 (LCP1), a membrane associated lymphocyte-specific target that is constitutively expressed on CLL and ectopically expressed in various cancers. Confirmatory assays unveiled robust LCP1-specific IgG autoimmune responses in CLL patients despite a profound absence of reactivity to common viral and vaccine antigens. LCP1 plays a critical role in B-cell biology by cross linking f-actin filaments, thereby solidifying cytoskeletal structures and providing a scaffold for CLL-critical signaling pathways such as PKC. Transwell assays confirmed that LCP1 activity contributed to the migration of CLL cells towards CXCL12. We further utilize a novel xenograft model to demonstrate LCP1 involvement in CLL pathogenesis. We have also characterized LCP1 expression within cancer derived exosomes revealing a previously unknown function of this gene. Our data reveals that LCP1 is a novel membrane associated target antigen in CLL with evidence of differential immune response as compared to common vaccine antigens.

Here, we report on the potential of a novel BiTE antibody targeting CD33 in redirecting autologous T cells for in vitro lysis of blasts from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Initial antibody titration experiments showed that CD33 BiTE concentrations at low picomolar ranges mediate effective lysis of leukemic cell lines. We next analysed primary samples from AML patients, which were co-cultured with mononuclear cells (MNC) from healthy donors in presence or absence of specific BiTE antibodies at an E\", 'T ratio of 1', '1. After 48h of incubation in the presence of 1ng/ml CD33 BiTE we observed a decrease of both CD33+ AML blasts as well as CD33+ monocytes when compared to samples with control BiTE or without BiTE. 1ng/ml CD33 BiTE specifically induced strong upregulation of activation markers CD25 and CD69 on the vast majority of all CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We furthermore investigated whether T cells from AML patients were able to mediate lysis of CD33+ leukemia cells by CD33 BiTE. T cells purified from peripheral blood or bone marrow of newly diagnosed AML patients were tested for BiTE mediated lysis of U-937 target cells. Redirected T cells from AML patients were capable of eliminating leukemic cells in the presence of CD33 BiTE as effectively as T cells from healthy controls. In consequence of this we studied blast lysis and T cell behaviour in a completely autologous setting using cryo-conserved samples from AML patients. Despite strong activation of T cells only moderate lysis of myeloid cells was observed after 48h, possibly due to low E', 'T ratios in these samples. Therefore, to allow autologous T cell expansion, cells were cultured for up to 144h. After this prolonged incubation, CD33 BiTE-mediated redirected lysis of AML blasts and myeloid cells was observed in most but those patient samples that had a very low initial effector-to-target (E', 'T) cell ratio. To adress this problem, we stimulated autologous T cells in a first step by incubating AML samples in presence of 1ng/ml CD33 BiTE for 7 days. After purification of the expanded T cells we performed autologous cultures with high initial E', 'T ratio (1', '1). This led to fast, effective and almost complete lysis of CD33+ target cells. Taken together, autologous T cells from AML patients are effectively engaged and activated by the novel CD33 BiTE and redirected for the elimination of myeloblasts at low picomolar concentrations in vitro and may thereby constitute a promising novel therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with CD33+ acute myeloid leukemia.']",

However, the knowledge about the advantages and disadvantages of RNA-seq in clinical decision-making and the suitability of mainstream RNA-seq library preparation methods for leukemia research are still in their infancy. Here, we have generated and sequenced polyadenylation selection (PA) and ribo-depletion (RD) RNA-seq libraries from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient samples and compared their fusion-gene, differential expression and related pathways and variant discovery abilities.Our analysis demonstrated that the RD protocol provided, on average, 5% more uniquely mapped reads than the PA protocol (81.5% of reads). Overall, 60%, 35%, and 3% of the reads in the RD libraries mapped to exonic, intronic, and intergenic regions, respectively. The corresponding numbers in the PA libraries were 76%, 21%, 3%, suggesting that PA captures more mature RNAs than the RD preparation and provides a higher read coverage for exon regions. The RD preparation was also marginally better in removing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) than the PA protocol. Regarding transcript quantification, both RD and PA produced fairly equivalent measures of RNA abundance. The patient-matched PA and RD libraries showed a high correlation (r = 0.96) that was slightly less than that seen between technical replicates (r = 0.98) but slightly more than that seen between library-matched sample from patients with the same disease (r = 0.93), indicating that inter-patient variance is the main source of variance in RNA-seq studies. Interestingly, based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using known leukemia gene signatures or gene targets of 17 clinically used drugs in AML and ALL treatment, the PA is more optimal than the RD method for disease classification (area under curve 0.69 vs. 0.65) and personalized cancer therapy guidance (AUC of 0.73 vs, 0.71). Finally, both methods equally detected known fusion genes, which were supported with high number of reads on fusionjunctions. However, in the case of lowly expressed fusion transcripts, only the RD method was able to detect fusions.In conclusion, both protocols produced consistence measures and were of similar usability. However, RD preparation captured more transcriptomic features and was more suitable for fusion-gene discovery, which may be of clinical relevance for sub-typing leukemia patients. The PA method on the other hand had higher overall sensitivity and specificity in gene expression analyses and was, based on our results, more suitable than RD for clinical classification and drug treatment guidance.']",

        "Background":"['Obesity promotes the pathogenesis of many cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood malignancy. Clinical studies have shown that children who are obese at the time of ALL diagnosis have a greater risk of relapse than normal weight children; however, this risk may be attenuated if their weight normalizes over the majority of treatment. One possible explanation is that nutrient-deficiency may induce host, but not ALL, cell senescence, thereby augmenting chemotherapy specificity and efficacy. Here, we hypothesize that a calorie- and fat-restricted diet during chemotherapy differentially alters host and ALL cell metabolism, improving chemotherapy efficacy and overall survival of high-fat diet-induced obese mice with ALL.To test the effect of dietary restriction on survival, C57BL/6J mice were placed on a high-fat diet (60% calories from fat) upon weaning. At 20 weeks of age, obese and control mice were implanted with syngeneic BCR/ABL+ ALL cells. After a 7-day latency, half of the obese mice were switched onto a low-fat (10% calories from fat) diet. Concurrently, vincristine chemotherapy (0.5mg/kg/wk x 4wks) was initiated and mice were tracked for survival. Separate groups of implanted mice were sacrificed 1 day before, 1 day and 1 week after dietary restriction for bone marrow and spleen collection. BrdU incorporation and p-AKT(Ser 473), p-eIF2A(Ser51) and p-S6K(Thr412) levels in marrow and spleen ALL and host cells were analyzed via flow cytometry for changes in cell cycle and metabolism. Finally, we also evaluated the effect of dietary restriction on human ALL outcome, using an obese xenograft ALL model treated with vincristine, dexamethasone and L-asparaginase.Dieted obese C57BL/6J leukemic mice exhibited a greater percentage of weight loss over the first two weeks of chemotherapy compared to non-dieted obese mice (Dieted vs. non-dieted obese', ' -25.210.6% vs. -0.34.5%, p<0.001). Dieted obese leukemic mice had significantly higher survival than non-dieted obese and lean mice after 4 months (Dieted', ' 91.6%, Obese', ' 16.7%, Lean', ' 41.7%; n = 12/group; p<0.001). Flow cytometry of the murine bone marrow and spleen showed no diet-induced alterations in BrdU incorporation or AKT pathway activation in either host or ALL cells. Surprisingly, however, we did not observe a similar effect of dietary restriction on survival in the obese xenograft ALL model.Based on these findings, a calorie and fat restricted diet initiated at the onset chemotherapy improves overall survival in obese mice with syngeneic ALL, though this phenomenon was not observed in a human xenograft model. Further work is needed to explore the possibility of a dietary intervention as an effective potential adjuvant during chemotherapy in obese cancer patients.']",

Western blot assay was performed for determining the functions and molecular mechanism of Imatinib in A431 cells. we found that Imatinib significantly inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, we observed that depletion of Skp2 triggered cell cycle arrest and colony formation inhibition by Imatinib. Mechanistically we identified that Imatinib markedly downregulated Skp2 protein expression and subsequently upregulated p21 expression via increased protein stability.

        "Background":"['Leukemia stem cells (LSC) play a crucial role in initiation, maintenance, and progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Targeted therapy with a BCR-ABL targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.g. dasatinib) has improved survival of patients with chronic phase CML. However, like blast crisis (BC) CML, survival remains only 30% over 5 years, and treatment frequently fails to eliminate dormant LSC that are hypothesized to drive CML relapse. Overexpression of BCL2 family genes has been observed in human BC CML and may fuel LSC survival. Our previous data demonstrated that pro-survival long isoforms of BCL2 and MCL1 were preferentially expressed in BC CML LSC compared to normal stem cells. These data showed that the bone marrow (BM) is enriched for BCL2 and MCL1-expressing LSC and serves as a reservoir for therapeutic resistance, thereby underscoring the importance of pan-BCL2 inhibition in the BM. A potent pan-BCL2 inhibitor, sabutoclax, has been identified that inhibits the binding of BH3 peptides to Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bfl1-1 at nanomolar concentrations.To demonstrate whether sabutoclax or the combination of sabutoclax and dasatinib could synergize to eradicate LSC in the BM, humanized BC CML LSC mouse models were established by using 50,000 CD34+ cells selected from primary BC CML patient samples and transplanted into neonatal RAG2-/-c-/- mice. Mice were screened for peripheral blood (PB) engraftment of human cells at 6 weeks, randomized, and dosed with (1) vehicle, (2) sabutoclax (10mg/kg, i.v., twice a week for 2 weeks), (3) dasatinib (50mg/kg, p.o., daily for 2 weeks), or (4) combination. Mice were sacrificed one day after last dose; PB, spleen (SP) and BM were collected for FACS analysis to measure engraftment and cell cycle status of LSC in different hematopoietic niches. BCL2 and MCL1 expression was measured in BM and SP by isoform specific qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Treatment of CML LSC-transplanted mice with sabutoclax alone led to a significant reduction in LSC burden in the SP, but only slightly in the BM. Meanwhile, Single agent sabutoclax reduced the engraftment of quiescent LSC. The effect of sabutoclax synergized with dasatinib to further reduce LSC burden in the BM to eradicate LSC that drive therapeutic resistance. Importantly, these treatments spare normal human stem cells in both BM and SP thereby providing in vivo evidence of a reasonable therapeutic index. Sabutoclax not only reduced the expression of BCL2 and MCL1 mRNA long isoform in the BM, but also significantly reduced the number of human CD34+, BCL2+ and MCL1+ cells in both BM and SP. These results demonstrate that BM and SP niche BC CML LSC survival is driven by overexpression of multiple pro-survival BCL2 family isoforms rendering them susceptible to a novel pan-BCL2 inhibitor, sabutoclax, at doses that spare normal hematopoietic progenitors.']",

        "Background":"['Alterations in translation are associated with various human malignancies, but the precise pathogenic processes and mechanistic underpinnings remain to be better understood. The oncogenic tyrosin kinase Bcr-Abl, which is believed to induce chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), could cause the dysregulation of mRNA translation initiation by activating a series of signal pathways. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), a critical element in the assembly of translation initiation complex, has been shown to anticipate in Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis. eIF4B is activated through Ser422 phosphorylation by several pathways including JAK/STAT/Pim and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Such redundant activation provides mechanistic bases for the less potent antitumor consequences under single-pathway targeted therapy. Interestingly, profound synergy was observed against cell survival and tumor growth and greater decrease of eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation was detected upon the combination of Pim and mTOR inhibitors. Knockdown of eIF4B would increase the dependence of Bcr-Abl positive cells on Pim and mTOR signaling and then sensitize cells to the synergistical effect mediated by the combined inhibition. In addition, inhibiting mTOR pathway by shRNA targeting AKT or mTOR renders cells dependent on Pim pathway and knockdown Pim1 would sensitize cells to mTOR inhibitor. Thus, eIF4B acts as a prominent role in Bcr-Abl-driven pathogenesis by playing as the convergent point of these pathways which are active in Bcr-Abl positive tumors. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Bcr-Abl-induced cellular transformation can be blokced and provides a rationale for combination therapy targeting the dysregulation of translation for CML.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Given that CML cells are usually highly resistant to chemotherapy, novel and more efficacious strategies against this disease are urgently needed. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a set of newly discovered 20-22 nucleotides RNA molecules, and they broadly repress their cognate target genes at post-transcriptional/trans-lational level. To date, there are approximately 2,500 human miRNA transcripts have been characterized, which are estimated to modulate more than 30% human genes by being involved in many essential normal biological and pathological processes including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis as well. In this study, we studied let-7a, a miRNA with tumor suppressive signature, for its therapeutic potential in CML. When treating CML K562 and KU812 cell by imatinib, let-7a can be significantly induced. Overexpression of let-7a can sensitize K562 and KU812 cells to imatinib, while knock-down of let-7a can increase the resistance of these cells towards this drug. The functional studies found that let-7a was able to promote apoptosis of CML cells, inhibit the tumor cell proliferation, and lead to a cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. These results demonstrate that let-7a is a potential target for treating CML by imatinib and/or other anti-cancer drugs. The pro-apoptosis and anti-proliferation roles of let-7a in CML cells may provide novel insights into discovery and development of more efficacious drugs for treating this malignant disease.']",

        "Background":"['Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has been shown to exert immunomodulatory effects in addition to direct oncokinase inhibition. Recently, we observed that dasatinib induces a rapid (within one hour after oral administration) and marked mobilization of lymphocytes (up to 8-fold increase in lymphocyte count), which closely follows the drug plasma concentration. In addition, in a subgroup of patients a clonal expansion of large granular lymphocytes occurs, which is correlated with good therapy response.As dasatinib-induced immunomodulatory effects are not leukemia specific, we aimed to exploit this activity to slow down or inhibit the growth of a syngeneic murine melanoma model and to characterize in detail the anti-tumor immune responses.Ovalbumin expressing murine melanoma cell line B16.OVA was grown under the skin of immunocompetent mice. The mice (n=6/group) were treated daily i.g. either with 30 mg/kg dasatinib or vehicle only. Blood was collected before tumor transplantation, before treatment, and on treatment days 4, 7 and 10. Tumor volumes were measured manually and specific growth rate was calculated based on the first and the last day of the treatment. In addition to white blood cell differential counts, immunophenotyping of blood and tumor homogenate was done by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD45.1, CD3, CD4, CD8b and NK1.1, and SIINFEKL-pentamer to detect B16.OVA-specific cells. To assess the functional properties of lymphocytes, we used antibodies against immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA-4 and PD-1, and a degranulation marker CD107.On the 10th day of treatment, the tumor volumes were smaller in dasatinib group compared to control group, and there was a significant decrease in the tumor growth rate (0.06 vs. 0.18, p=0.01). Furthermore, dasatinib treated mice had increased proportion of CD8+ cells in the circulation (21% vs. 14%, p=0.04) and the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly decreased (1.39 vs. 1.52, p= 0.04). During the tumor growth the mean CTLA-4 expression on CD8+ cells increased from 1.2% to 9% in the control group, whereas, in dasatinib group the increase was more modest (1.2% to 5.7%). Interestingly, 80% of tumor infiltrating CD8+ cells expressed PD1 antigen compared to <5% of PD1 positive CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood suggesting lymphocyte anergy or exhaustion induced by tumor cells.To conclude, dasatinib treatment slowed down the tumor growth in B16.OVA mouse model, which could be associated with the immunomodulatory effects of dasatinib. However, combinatorial treatment regimens may be needed as dasatinib is not able to fully break the immune cell anergy induced by tumor cells.']",

        "Background":"['Some cannabinol derivatives are said to possess antitumor efficacy. We have evidence that the CB1/2 cannabinoid receptor agonist Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of marijuana, may have contributed to disease control in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia. We speculated that THC may induce apoptosis in native leukemic blasts and thus treated various leukemia cell lines and ex vivo blasts derived from patients with either acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia in dilution series with THC. The antiproliferative effect was measured using an XTT-based assay. Induction of apoptosis was assessed by annexinV-based immunofluorescence analysis. The CB1 antagonist LY320135 or JTE-907, a selective CB2 inverse ligand agonist, were used to confirm involvement of CB1 (mainly expressed in brain tissue) or CB2 (expression in hematologic/lymphoid cells). THC was obtained with permission of the Bundesopiumstelle, Germany. Indeed, we demonstrate potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic efficacy of Delta9-THC in a dose dependent manner in leukemia cell lines of lymphoid and myeloid origin. Pretreatment with LY320135, but not with JTE-907, resulted in a dramatic abrogation of the antileukemic effect seen with THC monotherapy, arguing that THC-induced apoptosis is mediated via the cannabinoid receptor CB1. Besides a proapoptotic effect, THC was able to abrogate cellular differentiation blockage as observed in a change of morphology. Of note, THC was able to induce apoptosis in a subset of leukemia samples derived from patients with acute myeloid (mainly undifferentited AML) or lymphoblastic leukemia. Due to the patient cohort responsive to THC therapy, we speculated that epigenetic modifications might be associated with MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) methyltransferase function. In a global DNA methylation gene array, we could demonstrate that THC leads to modulation of methylation status of histone deacetylases, oncogenes and tumorsuppressors, some reported to be regulated by MLL. Ongoing work is focussing on validation whether THC treatment can be linked to MLL activity using an siRNA approach. In conclusion, while not being able to directly correlate the disease course of the above described patient to marijuana abuse, our in vitro results nevertheless demonstrate that THC mediates antileukemic activity in blasts of some patients ex vivo including that of our patient. Clinical evaluation of cannabinol receptor agonists as low-toxic agents could thus be considered in selected cases of patients with acute leukemia and this approach should further be followed.']",

The t(X;21)(q26;q22) appears to be novel. However, the rare t(3;21)(q26.2;q22) has been cited to segregate with therapy-related MDS/AML. Subsequent aberrant activation of RUNX1 and MECOM is postulated to be pivotal in pathogenesis. Therefore, it is of great interest to determine the translocation partner associated with RUNX1 in our case. This type of analysis is not easily amenable to either Sanger or conventional NGS approaches. Fortuitously, with the recent advent of AMP technology (Archer FusionPlex) novel fusion detection has become possible. AMP was key in the characterization of this sample and promotes discovery of novel fusions by targeting one (known) of the two genes involved in a translocation event. Application of this cutting edge technology lead to the discovery of the novel fusion RUNX1-G6PD in this case. The identity of the novel fusion partners was supported by the breakpoints originally observed by the karyotype analysis. G6PD has been previously reported to be upregulated in acute leukemia.

Dasatinib, a bcr-abl inhibitor, has been approved clinically for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and demonstrated to be effective against solid tumors in vitro through Src inhibition. Here, we disclose that dasatinib induced apoptosis of HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo through down-regulation of EGFR. Methods', ' HNSCC cells, including Ca9-22, FaDu, HSC3, SAS, SCC-25, and UMSCC1 were treated with dasatinib. Cell viability, apoptosis, and underlying signal transduction were evaluated. Results', ' Dasatinib exhibited differential sensitivities against HNSCC cells. The growth inhibition and apoptosis were correlated with its inhibition on Akt, Erk, and bcl-2, but irrespective of Src inhibition. Accordingly, we found that down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was a determinant of dasatinib sensitivity. Dasatinib inhibited EGFR through lysosome degradation. Increased EGFR activation by ligand administration rescued cells from dasatinib-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of EGFR enhanced its apoptotic effect. Estrogen receptor (ER) was demonstrated to play a role in bcl-2 expression, and dasatinib inhibited ER at pre-translational level. ER worked in concert with EGFR to regulate dasatinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, xenograft model showed that dasatinib inhibited HSC3 tumor growth through in vivo down-regulation of EGFR and ER.

        "Background":"['The tumor suppressor 2A (PP2A) is a multi-enzyme complex that targets a variety of oncogenic signaling cascades such as Raf, MEK and AKT. Numerous reports have now emerged indicating that the inhibition of PP2A leads to the development of tumors including breast, gastric and lung and a range of hematological malignancies such as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML and AML, respectively). We and others have shown that inhibition of PP2A is crucial for the oncogenic effects of leukemia associated receptor tyrosine kinases such as BCR/Abl, c-KIT and FLT3. Importantly when PP2A is reactivated using pharmacological agents (FTY720 and AAL(S)), growth and survival of these cells is inhibited. This approach targets molecules downstream of these oncogenic kinases and thus PP2A reactivation is designed to avoid resistance associated with kinase inhibitor therapy. As the mechanism of action of these PP2A activators is unknown, it is essential that we now determine the molecular targets of these compounds to generate more effective drugs. Using a chemical proteomics approach incorporating click chemistry linking the drugs to beads, unbiased pull down assays were performed in myeloid leukaemia cells and protein isolates were identified by mass spectrometry. Using this approach we have identified a novel cellular target, which is known to be overexpressed in a range of cancers, including leukemias. We have also shown that this protein associates with PP2A complexes in these cells, and thus may act as an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A activity. We have also performed phospho-proteomics and co-immunoprecipitation studies to identify protein changes in myeloid leukemia cells in response to PP2A activators. In addition to identifying known PP2A targets, such as Akt and ERK, we have also identified a number of novel protein changes, including altered expression of the SET oncoprotein. SET is a known inhibitor of PP2A, suggesting that FTY720 may act via inhibition of SET. Other PP2A regulatory proteins such as CIP2A, PME-1 and PP2A-B56alpha are also affected by FTY720/AAL(S) treatment. Our research findings are thus providing the vital clues necessary for determining the mechanism of action of clinically relevant PP2A activators, thereby moving us towards the provision of novel anti-cancer treatment regimes.']",

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate long-term outcomes at a large academic medical center for AML patients with IR or RD who did not receive early re-induction chemotherapy. Methods', ' Between 2002 and 2009, 233 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML received intensive induction chemotherapy at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.

At the nadir, IR and RD were defined as 5  20% and > 20% blasts, respectively. CR was achieved if platelets  100,000/L, absolute neutrophil count  1000/L, and the recovery BM had < 5% blasts. Results', ' Of 233 patients, 90 (38.6%) had no evidence of leukemia on their nadir BM, 56 (24.0%) had < 5% blasts but features of the BM remained concerning for residual leukemia, 50 (21.5%) had an IR, and 37 (15.9%) had RD. Thirty patients with < 5% blasts, 36 patients with an IR, and 34 patients with RD underwent re-induction.

        "Background":"['The fusion protein Bcr-Abl responsible for the oncogenic activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) depends heavily on oligomerization for function. Formation of Bcr-Abl oligomers occurs through a coiled-coil domain existing at the N-terminal portion of the Bcr segment. Previously, we have shown that disruption of this oligomerization utilizing a modified coiled-coil domain (CCmut2) both decreases the proliferation of CML cells and results in the induction of apoptosis. An important contributing factor to these results stems from the increased destabilization of CCmut2 homo-dimers. This phenomenon occurs due to the rationally mutated residues in the modified coiled-coil which allow for favorable interactions with the wild-type Bcr-Abl, but destabilizing interactions with other CCmut2 molecules, thus discouraging the formation of CCmut2 homo-dimers. In turn, this increases the availability and affinity for the modified coiled-coil to interact with and inhibit endogenous Bcr-Abl in CML cells. An additional mutation (K39E) was included that could potentially further destabilize the mutant homo-dimer. Added to the other mutations found in CCmut2 (C38A, S41R, L45N, E48R, Q60E), the new construct was termed CCmut3. To show that CCmut3 results in enhanced binding to a wild-type coiled-coil domain (representative of endogenous Bcr-Abl), 2 separate assays were performed. Colocalization studies were used to show the degree to which CCmut3 localizes intracellularly with Bcr-Abl. Additionally, a mammalian two-hybrid assay was conducted to show the relative selective dimerization between CCmut3 and the Bcr-Abl coiled-coil. Next, caspase 3/7 assays were performed and showed the ability of CCmut3 to induce apoptosis. The CCmut 3 also showed nuclear segmentation (a measurement of late-stage apoptosis) and decrease in oncogenic proliferation (via the colony forming assay). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for using CCmut3 as a therapeutic for CML. Lastly, attempts to truncate the CCmut3 to find the smallest possible sequence needed (e.g., helix 2) to bind and kill cells effectively is currently underway.']",

        "Background":"['Patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) can be treated with targeted bcr-abl kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. Recently, we reported that mononuclear cells obtained from individuals treated with imatinib often exhibit an increase in the enzyme activity of the antioxidant selenoprotein, glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Treatment of the bcr-abl positive cell line KU812 resulted in increased GPx enzyme and GPx1 protein levels in a dose (100-150 nM) and time (0-7 days) dependent manner, with a maximal increase of 3-fold. Imatinib-induced changes in other anti-oxidant enzymes were also assessed. Of these, no change in the levels of either catalase or GPx-4 were detected, although the levels of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) increased by a maximal level of 4-fold in imatinib-treated cells. Similar results were obtained in another bcr-abl positive, CML cell line, MEG-01. The elevation in the levels of these proteins occurred via a post-transcriptional mechanism as no increase in the steady state levels of the corresponding mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The effect of imatinib was likely to be dependent on the presence of the bcr-abl fusion product as no changes in either GPx-1 or MnSOD were detected in either the immortalized lymphocyte cell line GM10832 or the prostate cancer-derived LNCaP human cell lines, neither of which contain bcr-abl. Since the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a known protein substrate for the abl kinase, and mTOR activity can regulate protein translation, it was investigated whether inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin (1ng/ml) affected GPx-1 and MnSOD levels. Exposure of the KU812 and MEG-01 cells, as well as LNCaP and GM10832 with rapamycin resulted in increased GPx-1 protein and enzyme levels (2- to 4-fold), but had no measurable effects on MnSOD. These results indicate that imatinib, likely by the inhibition of bcr-abl, can post-transcriptionally enhance both GPx-1 and MnSOD levels, although by different mechanisms. These data may have therapeutic significance as both of these anti-oxidant enzymes may influence several different clinically relevant biological processes, including DNA damage susceptability, cell signaling and apoptosis.']",

In contrast, the overall remission rate of adults with leukemia continues to be poor, only about 40% in cases of T cell-ALL (T-ALL). Therefore, it is imperative to generate new therapies that alone or in combination with other treatments could potentially increase the percentages of complete responders or be used to treat the refractory ALL population. Our published results show that a pegylated form of human arginase I (peg-Arg I) prevented T-ALL cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo through the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Interestingly, the anti-leukemic effects induced by peg-Arg I did not affect the anti-tumor activity of normal T cells, suggesting an anti-tumor specific effect. Our hypothesis states that peg-Arg I has an anti-tumoral effect on B-ALL and T-ALL cells in vitro and that the sensitivity of ALL cells to peg-Arg I depends on their expression of argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) and their ability to produce L-arginine de novo from citrulline.

        "Background":"['The extent of heterogeneity in DNA sequence within human cancers has been difficult to fully assess, due to the absence of methods with sufficient sensitivity to detect minority variants. For example, next-generation sequencing could in principle detect sub-clonal mutations at any genomic position; however due to amplification errors and inaccuracies in the sequencing platform itself, such approaches are limited to detection of mutations present in >1% of cells. We have overcome this limitation by developing an approach, Duplex Sequencing, which improves the accuracy of next-generation sequencing by >100,000 fold. Duplex Sequencing is based upon separately tagging and sequencing the two strands of single molecules of duplex DNA. True mutations are present at the same position in both DNA strands and are complementary, whereas artifacts arising from amplification or sequencing errors are seen in only one strand. The calculated error rate of our approach is less than one artifactual mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced (ref. 1). We have also developed an enrichment approach based on sequential rounds of hybridization to biotinylated probes which enables efficient sequencing of targeted regions of the genome (ref. 2). Duplex Sequencing thereby enables exceptionally sensitive detection of sequence heterogeneity within any set of genes. We have now applied Duplex Sequencing to study of sequence heterogeneity in both normal and malignant samples. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we find multiple sub-clonal mutations which fall below the detection limit of conventional approaches, some of which encode mutations that can drive chemotherapy resistance and cancer progression. Our results indicate that prior studies have under-estimated the burden of sub-clonal mutations in AML by more than 1,000-fold. We have additionally studied chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); treatment of CML with inhibitors directed against the Abl kinase represents the prototypical targeted cancer therapy. With Duplex Sequencing, we find that Abl mutations are extremely uncommon at the time of CML diagnosis. In contrast, refractory patients who fail therapy frequently possess multiple sub-clonal mutations within the Abl kinase, most of which are below the resolution of conventional approaches but are readily detected with our method. In ongoing work, we have found multiple sub-clonal mutations within human prostate cancer and colon cancer, suggestive of widespread intratumor heterogeneity that may limit the efficacy of single-agent therapy in these diseases.References', '1.

However resistance occurs in many patients, most frequently due to point mutations in the Abl kinase. At the time of diagnosis, resistance mutations may already exist in a small fraction of the malignant cells. Second-generation inhibitors have been developed which can overcome specific resistance mutations. Identification of pre-existing resistance mutations would thus have important therapeutic implications, as it could inform which therapy would result in the most durable response in a given patient.Prior searches for pre-existing Abl mutations in CML have used methods such as allele-specific PCR or next-generation DNA sequencing; these methods are prone to background errors resulting in frequent false positive mutations. For example, next-generation sequencing has an error rate of 0.1%-1%, which results in a large number of erroneous mutations that obscure true variants. Enrichment of the Abl gene is also a major limitation. Nearly all prior reports have used PCR amplification for dozens of cycles to enrich the Abl gene prior to mutation detection; this process introduces thousands of PCR errors which make differentiation of true mutations from artifactual mutations challenging.We have developed a protocol for DNA sequencing, Duplex Sequencing, that separately tags and sequences each of the two strands of single DNA molecules. True mutations are present at the same position in both strands and are complementary, while PCR or sequencing errors occur in only one of the strands and are not scored. Duplex Sequencing has a calculated error rate of less than one artifactual mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced. To apply Duplex Sequencing to the Abl oncogene, we established a new, extremely efficient targeted capture approach that utilizes sequential rounds of capture with biotinylated DNA probes. This protocol results in >1,000,000 fold enrichment, with up to 99.8% of reads corresponding to the Abl gene. Duplex Sequencing was carried out at high depth (>100,000 fold), resulting in an average of 2,000 duplex reads per nucleotide position. The estimated accuracy for mutation identification was 99.9999%.We are in the process of sequencing samples from CML at the time of diagnosis and relapse to assay for drug resistance mutations below the limit of detection of conventional assays.

For EL-4 differences were seen in the groups treated with SCV-07 at 20 mg/kg (p=0.001) and 40 mg/kg (p<0.001); for MOLT-4 at10 mg/kg (p=0.003), 20 mg/kg (p=0.002) and 40 mg/kg (p<0.001); for HL-60 at 20 mg/kg (p=0.025) and 40 mg/kg (p=0.005); and for FADU at 20 mg/kg (p=0.004) and 40 mg/kg (p=0.004).  Conclusions', '  The immune modulating peptide SCV-07 is able to inhibit growth of a variety of tumor cell line types, including a human head and neck tumor line in nude mice. These results suggest that the use of SCV-07 as an intervention for mucositis should not interfere with therapy, but may enhance the tumor response to conventional therapy.']",

SMO dependent Hh signaling has also been implicated in models of myeloid leukemia, primarily CML, where genetic loss of SMO or pharmacological inhibition limits disease progression in part through targeting the leukemic stem cell (LSC). Outside of BCR-ABL driven leukemia the role of Hh signaling and impact of SMO inhibition on disease progression and the LSC remains unclear. To explore the role of Hedgehog pathway signaling and interrogate responses to SMO inhibition in AML, a panel of primary AML patient-derived models was utilized to examine responses to PF-04449913, an oral small molecule SMO inhibitor currently in early phase clinical trials targeting myeloid malignancies. AML patient samples were characterized for Hh pathway expression levels and screened for responses to PF-04449913. Ex vivo treatment of AML bone marrow cells showed PF-04449913 was capable of inhibiting Hh pathway activity, reducing expression of key LSC regulators and decreasing populations of cells expressing LSC markers. Use of AML xenotransplant models to assess in vivo responses to PF-04449913 as single agent and in combination with Cytarabine have shown potential for combination efficacy of the two agents in select models suggesting patient selection strategies may be critical for SMO inhibitor-based therapies in AML.']",

        "Background":"['Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies have profoundly changed the natural history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and prolonged survival. However, in vitro and in vivo data suggest strongly that the eradication of the most primitive CML stem cells will not be possible by the use of TKI therapies alone. The mechanisms of this inefficiency might involve cell autonomous (activation of alternate signaling, reduced BCR-ABL expression) or non-cell autonomous (niche-related) pathways. It would therefore be of major interest to determine if compounds targeting CML progenitors and stem cells can be used in combination with TKI. Few targeted therapies have been so far shown to be clinicaly acceptable.We have used for this purpose Inecalcitol (19, nor 14 epi 23-yne-1,25 (OH)2D3) (ICC),a vitamin D3 analog, which has been shown to exert antiproliferative effects in several types of cancer cell lines. CD34+ cells isolated from CML patients at diagnosis (n = 15) were tested in clonogenic assays (500 CD34+ cells / dish in triplicate). Interestingly, ICC alone is highly efficient to inhibit the clonogenic growth in the majority of the CML patients at diagnosis (10/ 15 patients). The combination of ICC with either Imatinib Mesylate (IM), Dasatinib (DA) or Nilotinib (NIL) in clonogenic assays showed a synergistic effect for the inhibition of CFC growth (10 - 25% CFC survival) using IM (n = 15 patients). In the same conditions, we have not observed any significant inhibitory effect of IM and ICC combination in cord-blood derived progenitors (n = 3).To determine the effects of these combinations in the most primitive stem cells, we have performed long-term cultures initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays using purified CD34+ cells (4.104 cells / dish) from CML patients with half medium changes each week for 5 weeks. The combination was tested in 6 (ICC+ IM) and 4 (ICC + DA / NIL) CML samples. As a control, CD34+ cells from cord blood were used. In CML samples tested with the combination of either IM / ICC (n = 6) or DA/ NIL and ICC (n = 4), CML LTC-IC derived progenitors were highly inhibited (ICC and IM) or undetectable (ICC and DA or NIL).Short-term cultures of CML CD34+ cells in the presence of 5 growth factors with or without ICC showed that ICC induced the expression of myeloid markers and highly favored the appearance of double positive CD14/CD15 cells. Experiments are underway to determine if ICC interferes with the expression of the components of SHH pathway (Smo, Ptched, Gli). as well as the gene expression profiling of CML cells treated with ICC. Thus, these results establish that ICC, a clinically used derivative of vitamin D3 has a clear activity in CML progenitors by itself and a major synergistic effect with TKI. A clinical phase 2 trial aiming to confirm the synergistic effect of ICC and TKI is ongoing in CML patients treated with imatinib.']",

        "Background":"['Cytarabine (1--D-arabinofuranosylcytosine; Ara-C) forms the backbone of chemotherapeutic regimes for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has a high success rate in inducing complete remission. However, the majority of AML patients will relapse within 2 years, often with an aggressive, chemoresistant form of the disease. Mechanisms associated with the development of relapsed disease remain to be fully elucidated, although recent whole-genome deep sequencing data derived from matched primary AML-relapse pairs demonstrated that relapse is associated with gain of novel mutations not seen at initial diagnosis [1] . Furthermore, the nature of relapse-specific mutations suggests these to be shaped, at least in part, by the chemotherapy used to induce and maintain remission.In order to investigate this further we have assessed the mutagenicity of Ara-C. We show here that the frequency of induction of mutations at thymidine kinase (TK) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) loci in vitro is increased following exposure to Ara-C, confirming this agent to be mutagenic in human cells. In addition, molecular characterization of Ara-C-induced mutations at the HPRT locus revealed that this commonly used nucleoside analogue induces a mutational fingerprint in vitro that can also be identified in vivo. Specifically, our data demonstrate that Ara-C is able to induce both deletion and base substitution mutations and has a strong propensity to induce mutations at 5TGA3/5TCA3 sequences in the genome, and particularly at the central G', 'C position consistent with its function as a cytosine analogue (p<0.001). Subsequent analysis of 4039 somatic AML mutations (3587 at disease presentation and 452 at relapse) derived from genome-wide deep sequencing data revealed that the frequency of putative Ara-C-associated G', 'C mutations in 5TGA3/5TCA3 sequences was significantly higher in AML relapse following Ara-C therapy compared to chemotherapy-nave leukemia at initial presentation (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.6; p=0.003).Given that most cancer patients die from progressive disease, understanding the etiology of somatic mutations responsible for driving the evolution of relapse is a substantial challenge in the management of malignant disease. Although long suspected to exist, our study is the first to identify a chemotherapy-induced mutational fingerprint in a relapsing cancer and demonstrates that chemotherapy plays a role in driving evolution of the somatic cancer genome. The approaches we present could be used to discern the contribution of other treatments to evolution of relapsed disease, informing both personalized medicine and drug development strategies.[1] Ding L et al.

For example, achieving a three-log or greater reduction in BCR-ABL expression from baseline is considered a Maximum Molecular Response (MMR). A 0.5-log increase from MMR signifies treatment failure sufficient to motivate change in treatment. The purpose of this study was to develop a BCR-ABL test with improved analytical performance characteristics including adequate quality control for RNA degradation or reverse transcription interference and reliable comparison of results across testing sites. To test whether RNA degradation could mask a 0.5-log increase in expression, an RNA degradation model was established by incubating whole blood from each of six individuals with K562 cells at room temperature for various times post-venipuncture. When data from six subjects were combined, the BCR-ABL/103 GUSB value trended down at 24h but was not significantly decreased until 48h (51% decrease, p = 0.004). To quantify the amount of whole blood RNA that can be loaded into an RT reaction without reducing RT efficiency, six different amounts of total RNA extracted from whole blood mixed with K562 cells were added into RT reactions. To measure RT efficiency, an RT Standards Mixture (RTSM) containing known copy numbers of External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) 171 RNA and ERCC 113 cDNA was added to each RT reaction. RT efficiency was measured as the yield of PCR product from ERCC 171 RNA relative to ERCC 113 cDNA. Based on data from three subjects, compared to RT efficiency at reference concentration of 30 ng/l RNA in RT, there was a 35% decrease (p = 0.043) at 167 ng/l RNA and 82% reduction at 1000 ng/l RNA. The maximum yield of BCR-ABL (molecules/L cDNA) was observed at 300 ng/l RNA/RT with a 3-fold increase (p=0.003) compared to 30 ng/l RNA. Greater than 300 ng/l RNA/RT did not further increase yield of BCR-ABL molecules/L cDNA, likely due to reduced RT efficiency. We conclude that BCR-ABL/103 GUSB should be measured within 24 hours following blood collection. Because decreasing RT efficiency is associated with increasing RNA input into RT reactions, including 300 ng/l RNA in RT reactions provides the maximum sensitivity in measuring BCR-ABL expression.']",

The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 plays a critical role in AML cell survival and chemoresistance. Mcl-1 is upregulated in relapsed AML and leukemic stem cells. Inhibition of Mcl-1 expression in AML cells by kinase inhibitors or gene targeting induces apoptosis and suppresses leukemogenesis. However, the impact of targeting Mcl-1 in AML therapy with selective pharmacological inhibitors remains to be assessed. Recently, we discovered a novel Mcl-1 inhibitor, maritoclax (marinopyrrole A), which antagonizes Mcl-1 by targeting Mcl-1 for proteasomal degradation. This unique mechanism of action is in contrast to BH3 mimetics that exert their inhibitory function through disruption of the interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In a panel of AML cell lines, the potency of maritoclax positively correlated with Mcl-1 expression and inversely correlated with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression. Maritoclax was efficacious as a single agent and markedly synergized with ABT-737 to induce apoptosis in Mcl-1 overexpressing ABT-737 and multidrug resistant AML cell lines. Moreover, maritoclax was able to overcome stroma-mediated resistance to apoptosis in AML cells. Importantly, maritoclax induced Mcl-1 degradation and apoptotic cell death selectively in clinical AML specimens with high levels of Mcl-1. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of maritoclax in vivo, we established U937 tumor xenografts in nude mice. As a single agent, maritoclax significantly inhibited the growth of established xenografts at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally. At this dosing level, no significant difference in body weight change and complete blood count was observed between maritoclax and vehicle treatment groups. Collectively, our studies demonstrated that maritoclax represents a novel class of Mcl-1 inhibitors and that the selective pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1 may be a viable approach for the treatment of AML.']",

        "Background":"['Our goal is to identify oncogenic loci in regions of recurrent DNA copy number alterations in cancer. Constitutional trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) carries a 20-fold increased risk of B-ALL, and chr.21 gains are the most common acquired aneuploidy in B-ALL. Interstitial amplification in the chr.21q22 region (iAMP21) is also a recurrent finding in B-ALL and carries a poor prognosis. However, the gene(s) on chr.21 responsible for this association remain unclear. We studied the Ts1Rhr mouse, which carries germline triplication of 31 genes homologous to human chr.21q22. Chr.21q22 triplication was sufficient to promote B cell autonomous self-renewal and maturation defects, and cooperated with BCR-ABL or CRLF2 with JAK2 R683G to accelerate leukemogenesis. Chr.21q22 triplication also resulted in histone H3K27 hypomethylation at gene promoters, and the expression signature of triplicated B cells was enriched for genes targeted by polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), which trimethylates H3K27. Thus, chr.21q22 triplication may deregulate B cell development by causing H3K27 hypomethylation at genes critical for progenitor cell growth. In support of this hypothesis, pharmacologic inhibition of PRC2 function was sufficient to confer self-renewal in wild-type B cells, while inhibition of H3K27 demethylases blocked self-renewal induced by chr.21q22 triplication. In three independent B-ALL cohorts, PRC2/H3K27 gene signatures distinguished leukemias with +21 from those without, validating the same biology in human disease. One of the 31 triplicated genes, HMGN1, encodes a nucleosome binding protein known to modulate chromatin structure and facilitate transcriptional activation. When we overexpressed HMGN1 in BaF3 proB cells, H3K27me3 decreased proportionally to the level of overexpression. We next knocked down each of the 31 triplicated genes with lentivirally-expressed shRNAs (5 per gene) and assessed the effects on growth of Ts1Rhr and wild-type primary B cells. Strikingly, Hmgn1 was the top scoring gene and all 5 hairpins targeting Hmgn1 were depleted in the assay. Finally, we studied transgenic mice (HMGN1_OE) that overexpress human HMGN1 (2-fold total overexpression). HMGN1_OE mice had a defect in B cell maturation, increased proB colony forming capacity, and a transcriptional signature overlapping with that of triplication of all 31 Ts1Rhr genes. In a bone marrow transplant model driven by BCR-ABL, recipients of HMGN1_OE bone marrow developed B-ALL with decreased latency (median 33 days vs not reached) and increased penetrance (17/18 vs 4/17 mice died by 80 days; leukemia-free survival difference P<0.001) compared to recipients of wild-type bone marrow. These data indicate that HMGN1 is a B-ALL oncogene, and therapies targeting HMGN1 or the downstream effects of HMGN1 overexpression on epigenetic histone modifications may be effective in B-ALL with copy number gains involving chr.21q22.']",

        "Background":"['B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by actively dividing B-lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and bone marrow, associated with the accumulation of quiescent lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of affected patients. Current treatments for this disease include chemotherapeutic (chlorambucil (CLB), cyclophosphamide, fludarabine) and immunotherapeutic agents (Rituximab, Alemtuzumab) or the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapeutics drugs. In 2008, the FDA approved bendamustine, a bifunctional agent with a nitrogen mustard moiety and a purine analog, for the treatment of patients with CLL. Signals from the bone marrow and lymph node microenvironments protect CLL lymphocytes from drug-induced apoptosis. During treatment the enzyme-mediated repair of DNA damage can induce resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. We have previously shown that small molecule inhibitors of c-abl (a key protein of the homologous recombinational repair pathway) such as imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib, sensitize primary CLL lymphocytes to CLB. We also demonstrated that ZRF4, a combi-molecule designed to target c-abl (through an imatinib moiety) and to induce DNA damage (through a nitrogen mustard moiety), has a more potent cytotoxic effect than the combination of CLB plus imatinib in CLL lymphocytes. Here we report the anticancer effect of three different combi-molecules composed of a chlorambucil moiety and a dasatinib (a dual Src/c-abl inhibitor) moiety compare to the individual components in primary CLL lymphocytes in-vitro. Using MTT assays on CLL lymphocytes from 40 CLL patients, we found that the IC50 (concentration which kills 50% of the cells) of AL748, AL758 and AL816 are significantly lower than the IC50 of CLB when used alone and the combination of CLB with 0.1 M dasatinib (median value = 1.7 M, 0.6 M, 0.9 M, 11 M and 3.1 M respectively). Moreover, our biochemical results suggest that the mechanism of action of AL758, AL816, CLB and CLB plus dasatinib share common downstream targets including inhibition of Src kinase, chemotaxis, and cross-talk with the microenvironment along with induction of DNA damage (p53, p21, comet assay) and apoptosis (AnnexinV, cleaved caspase-3). We also determined, by the MTT assay, the cytotoxic effect of the combi-molecule AL887 composed of a bendamustine moiety and a dasatinib moiety, compare to the individual components in vitro in primary B-lymphocytes from 20 CLL patients. Our results demonstrated that this combi-molecule has a better anticancer activity than bendamustine in combination with 0.1 M dasatinib (p<0.0005).Dose-limiting toxicity and drug pharmacokinetics are important and limiting factors to take into account for the development of chemotherapy and will be tested in a CLL mouse model. Our results suggest that the combi-molecules AL758, AL816, and AL887 may be useful alternatives for treatment of CLL patients.']",

        "Background":"['Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a component of highly effective therapy for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the most common childhood cancer. Although successful in 90% of patients, the prognosis for the remaining 10% is dismal. Because sensitivity to GCs alone predicts outcome well, we hypothesized that enhancing or restoring GC sensitivity can improve outcome. To first determine how GCs kill B-ALL cells, we first measured the transcriptional response of sensitive B-ALL samples to dexamethasone (dex). In addition to apoptotic genes (BIM, BCL2), and metabolic genes (TXNIP) identified in other studies that contribute to cell death, we also found broad regulation of B cell development genes, including key checkpoints (ITGA4, IL7R, and BCL6). This suggested that high levels of GCs push arrested B-ALL cells through development, resulting in cell death. To validate these results, and to identify cellular pathways that modulate GC cytotoxicity, we used a next-generation shRNA screen to knock down every protein-coding gene in the genome. The screen identified 265 genes that significantly modulate GC sensitivity. In addition to validating the importance lymphoid development genes, the screen revealed which cofactors and chromatin modifiers collaborate with GR to orchestrate cell death gene programs. Further we were able to map critical signaling pathways with high resolution, including the pro-survival B cell receptor pathway. Inhibition of PI3K at the apex of this pathway potentiated the response of GC-regulated genes to dex, and synnergized with dex to induce cell death in even the most refractory B-ALL tissue. These results indicate a previously unrecognized for GCs in B cell development that can be exploited to improve both the potency and treatment of lymhoid disease.']",

Many of these patients (pts) display a Ph-like gene expression profile (GEP), but lack canonical BCR-ABL1 fusion. We have identified alternate kinase fusions in Ph-like ALL that induce cell proliferation sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (Roberts, NEJM 2014). We report retrospective analyses of 1390 B-ALL pts, 885 NCI high risk and 505 standard risk B-ALL pts with elevated minimal residual disease.Methods', ' Cases were screened using an 8-gene Taqman low-density array (LDA) PCR assay to identify the Ph-like GEP (Harvey, ASH 2013). Ph-like cases with elevated CRLF2 expression were tested for CRLF2 rearrangement (CRLF2-R; P2RY8-CRLF2 by Taqman PCR on the LDA card and IGH-CRLF2 by FISH). JAK mutations in CRLF2-R cases were tested by Sanger sequencing. Ph-like cases without CRLF2-R were tested for previously identified kinase fusions involving ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, NTRK3, and PDGFRB by RT-PCR. Ph-like cases without detected fusions underwent RNA-sequencing, either using standard Illumina library preparation or a customized kinome capture kit (Agilent).Results', ' 339 (24%) pts were Ph-like. BCR-ABL1 (N = 45) and ETV6-RUNX1 (N = 11) were excluded from further analyses, as the former already receives TKI therapy and ETV6-RUNX1 ALL lacks targetable kinase fusions (unpublished). Of the remaining 283 Ph-like cases, 153 were CRLF2high (defined by CRLF2 expression levels on the LDA card). 61 (40%) had P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion, and of the remaining 91 CRLF2high cases, 56 of 69 tested had CRLF2-R (55 to IGH, 1 to an unknown partner). Thus, 117/130 (90%) CRLF2high Ph-like cases had a documented CRLF2 genomic lesion and 52 (44%) of these had a JAK mutation. Of the 130 Ph-like CRLF2low cases, 61 (47%) had a previously reported targetable TK fusion identified by RT-PCR, kinome capture or RNA sequencing. These included', ' 38 ABL class fusions (17 ABL1, 5 ABL2, 3 CSF1R, 13 PDGFRB) sensitive to imatinib/dasatinib; 14 JAK2 and 8 EPOR fusions sensitive to ruxolitinib; and 1 NTRK3 fusion sensitive to crizotinib. Nine cases had known fusions with new alternate breakpoints, and an additional 9 cases had fusions of novel N-terminal partners with known actionable C-terminal kinase genes. RNA sequencing identified 8 cases with IGH-EPOR fusions not previously captured by the kinome assay, indicating the cryptic and complex nature of this rearrangement.Conclusion', ' Almost half of Ph-like pediatric B-ALL pts lacking CRLF2-R harbor altered TKs with compelling pre-clinical data that they are likely amenable to targeted therapy using FDA-approved TKIs.

        "Background":"['Tyrosine kinases (TK) are frequently deregulated in human cancer and they play important roles in tumor progression. Since then, they have become valuable therapeutic targets and several inhibitors are currently used in the clinic. For example, the BCR-ABL inhibitor nilotinib is currently used for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here we show that this antileukemic drug also inhibits invasive properties of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Inhibition was observed at the same dose-range for growth inhibition of CML cells. Nilotinib also strongly reduced liver metastasis induced by injection of CRC cells in the spleen of nude mice. Since we could not detect Abl deregulation in CRC cells, we speculated the involvement of an alternative target to be identified. Interestingly, a previous chemical-proteomic approach identified DDR1 as a novel target of nilotinib (Rix et al, Blood, 2007). DDR1 is a poorly-characterized TK and a receptor for collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix. Accordingly, we found that DDR1 catalytic activity regulates cell invasion and metastasis of CRC cells. In addition, we demonstrate that nilotinib pharmacological activity is mediated by the inhibition of DDR1 in CRC cells', ' expression of the nilotinib resistant DDR1/T701I mutant renders CRC cells resistant to nilotinib treatment. Finally, we found that DDR1 catalytic activity is significantly increased in metastatic nodules compared to the primary tumor and the healthy tissue of the same patient. Altogether, these data suggest that the targeting of DDR1 by nilotinib may be of therapeutic value in metastatic CRC.Citation Format', ' Priscillia Tosti, Cdric Leroy, Valrie Simon, Bruno Robert, Josiane Pierre, Audrey Sirvent, Serge Roche.

Real Time PCR(RTPCR) has been the tool of choice for its sensitivity and dynamic range. The International Scale was recently introduced to allow for standardization across laboratories. Chip based Digital PCR(dPCR) which allows for absolute quantitation may obliviate the need for such standardization by giving absolute results.It has the potential to increase sensitivity for detection of minimal residual disease. This assumes great significance as we move into the era of treatment free remission. Methods', ' A total of 31 EDTA-blood samples of CML patients with known values ranging from 0.003-0.5 IS were processed via an accredited RTPCR protocol calibrated to the IS scale and a parallel dPCR workflow without any specific calibration . The analysis of digital PCR samples was performed on the Thermofisher Cloud Platform. Results', ' Both RTPCR and dPCR yielded extremely concordant results. The Pearson correlation between the two methods was r = 0.6043 (95%CI', ' 0.318 to 0.789; p = 0.0003).

The mean difference for the ratios between the two methods used for the detection was around 0.08. Conclusions', ' We demonstrate here the capability of dPCR to provide a parallel result to an IS scale calibrated protocol without any standardization. This approach required no specific calibrators or standards and resulted in extremely cost effective testing. This freedom from routine calibration provides for a significantly more robust workflow and greatly increased reliability. Limitations do persist in dPCR on account of limited chip densities which are the main parameter for the Poisson statistics. This has limited the dynamic range on dPCR to a maximum of Log 4 for accurate quantification. However as chip densities and emulsion concentrations increase in these technologies, they are poised to introduce a new era in the quest of accurate quantification.']",

Currently, European LeukemiaNet guidelines recommend mutation analysis to be performed by denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC) and/or direct sequencing. Using Roche 454 next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology on a GS Junior instrument, we investigated whether an ultra-deep amplicon sequencing strategy for mutation screening of the Bcr-Abl KD could highlight emerging clones harbouring critical mutations, ultimately anticipating the development of drug-resistance. A lower detection limit of 0.05% - 5 mutated Bcr-Abl transcripts in a total of 10,000 Bcr-Abl transcripts - could routinely be achieved. Serially collected samples from IM-resistant CML and Ph+ ALL pts who received DAS and/or NIL as 2nd- or 3rd-line therapy and developed DAS- or NIL-resistant mutations were retrospectively analyzed from the time of switchover to the time of relapse. NGS was able to confirm all mutations known to be present in >20% of cells, allowed to follow quantitatively the dynamics of mutated clones over time and showed that i) 9/12 IM-resistant pts who failed to achieve a satisfactory response to 2nd-line therapy (primary resistance) were already harbouring mutations known to be insensitive to DAS (T315I, F317L/V) or NIL (E255K/V, Y253H, F359V/C) at 1-10% level before the TKI start - despite they had been scored as wild-type by D-HPLC; ii) in 9/13 IM-resistant pts who relapsed after an initial response (acquired resistance), the emerging resistant clone(s) carrying DAS- or NIL-insensitive mutation(s) could be identified up to six month in advance than when D-HPLC and conventional sequencing were used. In addition, when used for mutation monitoring of newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL pts enrolled in clinical trials with DAS or NIL, NGS again highlighted emerging resistant clones in 7/8 pts who later relapsed. We conclude that the higher sensitivity of NGS allows to detect emerging mutant clones earlier than the currently used methods; this is particularly relevant', ' i) in IM-resistant CML and Ph+ ALL pts before switching to and during treatment with a 2nd-line TKI, where NGS may anticipate the presence of DAS- or NIL-insensitive mutations, ensuring the most effective and timely therapeutic decisions; ii) more in general, for mutation monitoring of Ph+ ALL pts, that are known to be highly genetically unstable, hence markedly prone to develop resistance and mutations while on TKI therapy.

        "Background":"['GSK3 alpha has been shown to be a new target in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however current GSK3 inhibitors are unselective and target both GSK3 alpha and GSK3 beta. Interestingly, a known pan-GSK3 inhibitor LiCl has been previously investigated for the treatment of AML yet has met limited clinical success. This could be partly due to the fact that pan-GSK3 inhibition results in beta-catenin stabilization, which has been shown to mediate hematopoietic self-renewal and leukemogenesis. As beta-catenin stabilization requires inhibition of both kinases and most GSK3 inhibitors target GSK3 alpha and GSK3 beta with equal potency, these compounds may possess some significant limitations. We have previously shown GSK3 alpha to be a prominent target of the intended MET inhibitor tivantinib (ARQ197) and that tivantinib shows some specificity for GSK3 alpha over GSK3 beta. We thus hypothesized that tivantinib would be an effective therapy for the treatment of AML. Consistently, tivantinib potently inhibited cellular viability across several AML cell lines. Using an unbiased, mass-spectrometry based chemical proteomics approach; we confirmed GSK3 alpha (and to a slightly lesser extent GSK3 beta) to be targeted by tivantinib in AML. Tivantinib strongly induced apoptosis as compared to the pan-GSK3 inhibitor LiCl in these cells while LiCl showed larger effects on cell differentiation. Interestingly tivantinib caused less stabilization of beta-catenin as compared to LiCl. Subsequent drug combination studies identified the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 to synergize with tivantinib and to amplify apoptosis as seen by PARP1 cleavage. Furthermore, the combination of tivantinib with ABT-199 completely abrogated beta-catenin stabilization. Tivantinib was able to significantly inhibit colony formation of primary AML patient bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) and ABT-199 combination showed significant benefit over tivantinib or ABT-199 alone. In summary, tivantinib has potent anticancer activity in AML based on targeting GSK3 alpha; and tivantinib single agent or combination with ABT-199 may represent a novel and exciting opportunity for the treatment of AML.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous collection of bone marrow clonal disorders that leads to clonal expansion and ineffective hematopoiesis, remaining incurable in the majority of adult patients. The physiopathology of this disease involves impaired epigenetic regulation and resistance to conventional treatment. Such epigenetic marks can be reversed by nucleoside analogs (NA) DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) such as azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (standard treatment for pre-AML myelodysplastic syndromes; MDS), and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). These agents synergistically induce re-expression of silenced genes resulting in cell growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis. We have shown that interactions between NA and HDACis relied on mechanisms modulating activation of pro-survival NA-mediated NF-kB signaling, based on which we analyzed several original transcriptional expression datasets related to the treatment of AZA or HDACis in AML cell lines, xenografts and MDS/AML patients, and identified dexamethasone (DEX) as a candidate repositioned-drug', ' 1) DEX could suppress the VEGFA, STAT5, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and their cognate receptors gene sets in primary human bone marrow progenitor cells, which are significantly activated in MDS/AML patients resistant to AZA+HDACi treatment; 2) DEX could inhibit the alternative activated signaling molecules responsible for resistance to AZA; 3) two clusters of aberrantly methylated (hypo and hyper) genes examined were significantly enriched in blasts from MDS patients comparing with healthy people, and DEX was able to normalize expression of these genes; 4) DEX could suppress the elevated target genes of P210 BCR-ABL gene fusion in MDS patients; and, importantly 5) DEX has wide inhibitory effects on the NF-kB pathway-targeted cytokines, chemokines, and their modulators on human bone marrow CD34+ cells compared to untreated cells. Repositioned DEX was validated in human leukemia cells exposed to HDACi/NA, a situation where a marked reduction in the synergism exists because of strong NF-kB activation. In the presence of DEX, either the drugs alone or in combination displayed a significant increase in lethality, notably in the case of HDACi/NA. As expected from our analysis, DEX inhibited HDACi/NA-induced NF-kB activation in human leukemia cells; importantly, co-administering HDACi/NA with DEX had a major impact on the outcome of the drug combination. This new concept is critically relevant for therapies involving NA and HDACis since AML cells that are still alive after treatment constitute one of the main sources of chemo-resistance. Thus, addition of DEX to the therapeutic intervention which results in almost 100% cell death, may directly affect this small percentage of cells with increased survival capacity, and thereby reduce/delay the probability of relapse.']",

However, the functional relevance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their in vivo regulation during Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis remain unknown, although recent studies have shown that aberrant expression of lncRNAs is associated with various human cancers. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in human CML cells using an lncRNA cDNA microarray, and identified an lncRNA termed lncRNA-BGL3 that acted as a key regulator of Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. Notably, we observed that lncRNA-BGL3 was highly induced in response to disruption of Bcr-Abl expression or by inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase activity in K562 cells and leukemic cells derived from CML patients. Ectopic expression of lncRNA-BGL3 sensitized leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis and inhibited Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing lncRNA-BGL3 were generated. We found that transgenic expression of lncRNA-BGL3 alone in mice was sufficient to impair primary bone marrow transformation by Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, we identified that lncRNA-BGL3 was a target of miR-17, miR-93, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a and miR-106b, microRNAs that repress mRNA of PTEN. Further experiments demonstrated that lncRNA-BGL3 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for binding these microRNAs to cross-regulate PTEN expression. Additionally, our experiments have begun to address the mechanism of how lncRNA-BGL3 is regulated in the leukemic cells and showed that Bcr-Abl repressed lncRNA-BGL3 expression through c-Myc-dependent DNA methylation. Taken together, these results reveal that Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation critically requires silence of tumor suppressor lncRNA-BGL3 and suggest a potential strategy for the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia.']",

Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of ALL in immune-deficient mice are a clinically relevant testing model as they recapitulate original disease characteristics and allow monitoring of engraftment and drug response by flow cytometric enumeration of the% human vs mouse CD45+ cells in the mouse peripheral blood (PB). However, factors such as leukemic harbor and relapse sites are overlooked, and this model may be biased towards drugs that clear circulating lymphocytes. This study aimed to overcome these shortfalls by introducing a bioluminescence imaging (BLI) capability into a pediatric ALL PDX to enhance monitoring of leukemia burden. Firefly luciferase was incorporated via lentiviral transduction, and BLI and PB measures used to track engraftment and response to an induction-type drug regimen; vincristine (0.15 mg/kg weekly x 4), dexamethasone (5 mg/kg daily x 5  4) and L-asparaginase (1,000 KU/kg daily x 5  4) (VXL). Additional groups received 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125x this dose for 2 weeks. Engraftment by BLI and PB correlated strongly (R2 = 0.8, p = <0.0001) yet BLI detected engraftment 6 weeks before PB. VXL response was scored using PB measures and stringent response criteria used by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program, modeled after the clinical setting. The 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1x groups scored Progressive Disease 2, Stable Disease, Complete Response (CR) and Maintained CR, respectively. BLI was able to quantify regression with greater range and sensitivity than PB, highlighting a large difference in regression between the 1x and 0.5x groups. A median 3.2-fold decrease in whole-body bioluminescence (photons/sec/steradian/cm2) was seen in the 0.5x group at treatment end relative to Day 0, compared to a >2,000-fold decrease in the 1x group. Autopsy of mice at Day 28 revealed a median of 0.8% blasts in the bone marrow (BM) in the 1x group compared to 35% in the 0.5x group. Since the clinical definition of a CR is <5% blasts in the BM at Day 28, the 0.5x group did not achieve a CR by this classification, despite scoring a CR by PB measurements. BLI supported this finding, revealing >2000-fold decrease in BM bioluminescence in the 1x group relative to Day 0, and a 1.3-fold increase in the 0.5x group. These results show that BLI enhances the sensitivity of drug efficacy testing in this PDX model, and allows quantification of efficacy in discreet leukemic harbor sites such as the BM. This work suggests BLI can increase the stringency of preclinical drug testing to accurately prioritize agents for clinical trials.']",

When PC9 cells were cultured with 2 M gefitinib solved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), most of cells died and surviving cells proliferated slowly. By 90 days-culture with 2 M gefitinib, PC9 gefitinib resistant cells (PC9GR90) were established and confirmed that EGFR-T790M resistance-related mutation was negative. In PC9GR90, an immunoblot assay revealed MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) amplification and alternative EGFR3 tyrosine phosphorylation, which is known as one of the major resistant mechanisms. Results', ' When PC9GR90 were cultured with 2 M gefitinib and one inhibitor (histone deacetylase inhibitor, insulin-like growth factor receptor inhibitor, gamma secretase inhibitor, or imatinib known as bcr-abl, c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor inhibitor), 10 M imatinib treatment with gefitinib showed significant suppression of cell growth. The ratio of cell count of 2 M gefitinib/DMSO and 10 M imatinib with 2 M gefitinib/DMSO were 91.7% and 6.0%, respectively.

        "Background":"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy characterized by the progressive accumulation of CD19+ B-cells capable of overcoming their regulated life cycle. Because this disease is highly heterogeneous and utilizes several mechanisms to resist apoptotic death, CLL currently remains incurable. Based on the ongoing efforts to interpret the transcriptional dynamics of CLL pathogenicity as well as prior reports demonstrating the efficacy of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) transcriptional inhibitors, we sought to characterize the molecular response of CLL cells treated with the covalent CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 and determine the therapeutic potential of CDK7 inhibition in CLL. We first observed that THZ1 was able to inhibit growth in malignant B-cell lines MEC1 and MEC2 in both a dose dependent (IC50', ' .045uM & .030uM, respectively) and time dependent manner. The inhibition in cell growth corresponded with both G1-mediated cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis in the respective cell lines. We also observed dose-dependent reduction in cell viability through apoptosis in patient-derived CLL B-cells after 24 hours. Because of the observed outcomes of THZ1-treated CLL cells, we then wanted to determine the specific transcriptional targets significantly suppressed by THZ1 treatment. To identify the THZ1-sensitive transcripts, we performed a time course RNAseq expression analysis in both MEC1 and MEC2 treated with 50nM THZ1. Based on the incremental reduction of covered reads over a 12-hour period, we determined that the top 50 transcripts greatly diminished in both MEC1 and MEC2 contain significant enrichment in genes attributed to glycolytic metabolism (ex', ' ALDOC, SLC2A1, TPI1, GAPDH, ENO2). Along with the overlapping comparison between the two cell lines, we next compared the downregulated transcripts from the treated cell lines against the RNAseq expression profile of 47 CLL patients and 5 healthy donors. We observed that THZ1 was able to suppress transcripts upregulated in CLL patient samples including ENO2, FGR, WNT10A, and CBX7 in MEC1 and ENO2, MALAT1, CCR7, and PLCG1 in MEC2. Finally, we performed H3K27Ac ChIPseq in MEC1 to identify super enhancers that may overlap with THZ1-sensitive transcripts. From this comparison, we determined that super enhancers exist within reported oncogenic drivers CBX7, WNT10A, and FGR. Overall, we observe that THZ1 can effectively overcome the anti-apoptotic phenotype of CLL B-cells as well as directly suppress transcription of genes that can drive CLL malignancy. With the addition of CDK7 ChIPseq, our ultimate goal is to provide clarity regarding CDK7-mediated transcriptional regulation in CLL and demonstrate the molecular consequences of therapeutic CDK7 inhibition in CLL.']",

Presence of activating mutations, gene fusions or copy number amplification of many of these kinases predict responsiveness to specific inhibitors, for example, imatinib for BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, trastuzumab and lapatinib for ERBB2-amplified breast cancers, gefitinib for lung cancers with kinase domain mutations in EGFR, and crizotinib for lung cancers with ALK gene fusions. However, tumors with defined kinase aberrations represent a very small proportion of all cancers, and we hypothesize that potentially most, if not all, cancers are dependent on specific kinases, and that Outlier Expression of specific kinases in individual samples may be indicative of selection during clonal evolution, and thus may represent a therapeutic avenue. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data from a compendium of 482 cancer and benign samples belonging to 25 different tissue types to define sample-specific kinome expression profiles. Comparing the expression of kinases within a sample and across sample sets, we identified distinct outlier kinases in individual samples, defined as genes showing the highest statistically significant levels of absolute and differential expression. Frequently observed outlier kinases included known therapeutic targets like ERBB2 and FGFR4 in breast cancer, distinct from MET, AKT2, and PLK2 in pancreatic cancer. Outlier kinases imparted sample-specific dependencies in various cell lines as assessed by siRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Outlier expression of polo-like kinases (PLKs) observed in a subset of KRAS-dependent pancreatic cancer cell lines conferred increased sensitivity to the PLK inhibitor BI 6727. Together, our results suggest that outlier kinases represent effective personalized therapeutic targets that are readily identifiable through RNA-sequencing of tumors. Next, to help translate these observations into treatment options, we are attempting to establish 3D tumoroid cultures from tumor samples that can be used to optimize combinations of therapeutics including outlier kinase inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Previous studies have identified that BCR-ABL elevates cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) through mitochondria and NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX). However, it is still unknown how BCR-ABL over-expressed cells can maintain such altered redox status, while escaping from the persistent oxidative stress-induced cell damage or apoptosis. Therefore elucidation of the mechanisms by which CML cells cope with oxidative stress will provide important insights into the molecular events leading to leukemia development and drug resistance. The major goals of this study are to investigate the role of BCR-ABL-regulated downstream cell survival factors in providing an adaptive mechanism which allows CML cells to survive in the presence of cellular oxidative stress, and to evaluate the potential therapeutic implications. Several experimental models were used to test the cellular redox status and relative sensitivity of oxidative stress-induced cell death in our study, including BCR-ABL inducible cell lines, BCR-ABL stably transformed cell lines and BCR-ABL-expressing CML blast crisis cells with different BCL-XL/BCL-2 patterns. Additionally, we established an artificial CML cell model with heterogenic BCL-XL/BCL-2 expression to assess the correlation between cell survival factor genetic background and cell sensitivity to Imatinib and oxidative stress. In this study, BCL-XL has been identified as the major survival factors responsive to BCR-ABL-promoted cellular oxidative stress and plays a dominant role in regulating the threshold of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The cell survival factors BCL-XL and BCL-2 differentially protect mitochondrial integrity under oxidative stress. BCL-XL is an essential survival factor in maintaining viability of the cells with the excessive ROS while BCL-2 seems to play a relatively minor role. In addition, combination of redox-modulating reagent -phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) with BCL-XL/BCL2 inhibitor ABT737 or suppression of BCL-XL expression by BCR-ABL inhibitor Gleevec dramatically sensitizes CML cell to ROS stress-induced apoptosis.

NSD1 methylates H3K36 and H4K20 and is associated with acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lung cancer. The NSD1-NUP98 translocation plays a significant role in childhood acute myeloid leukemia with NUP98-NSD1 being an active H3K36 methylase. NSD1 is amplified in multiple myeloma, lung cancer, neuroblastomas and glioblastomas. NSD2 methylates H3K36 and is linked to prostate cancer and multiple myeloma. Over expression of NSD2 in myeloma cells leads to aberrantly high levels of H3K36 di-methylation, accompanied by a decrease in H3K27 methylation. NSD2 is found over expressed in fifteen different cancers and is associated with tumor aggressiveness or prognosis in most types of cancers. NSD3 methylates H3K36 and is associated with both lung and breast cancers along with the acute myeloid leukemia. The amplification of either NSD1 or NSD2 triggers the cellular transformation. NSD3 is found amplified in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast carcinomas. Reducing NSDs activity through specific and selective lysine-HMTase inhibitors appears promising to help suppressing cancer growth. Little is known about the NSD pathways and our understanding of the histone Lysine-HMTase mechanism is partial. The SET domain of NSD1 has specific mechanisms to recognize histone marks unlike other HMTase. The precise catalytic activities of the NSDs are obscure and discrepancies exist hindering progress in understanding their exact biological functions and pathways in cancer pathogenesis. In this study, we explored the in vitro catalytic activities on histone substrates to understand the substrate recognition and to pave the way for the design of selective and specific NSD inhibitors usable in cancer therapies. Methods', ' We used both biochemical and computational methods to understand the substrates recognition by the NSDs and to investigate the structural mechanisms happening in the SET domain during the binding of histone tails. Results', ' A key regulatory and a recognition mechanism is driven by the flexibility of a loop at the interface of the SET and postSET region who rotates 45 and translated 7 opening the SET domain for the binding of the peptide ligand. This regulatory loop acts as a seat belt for the ligand and contributes to the discrimination and the substrate specificity. In vitro, The SET domain of the NSDs favor H3 recognition and are able to methylate a range of substrate. To reconcile with the in vivo activities previously reported on H3K36 and H4K20, we propose a cross-talk mechanism controlling the substrate recognition.']",

        "Background":"['Contemporary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy involves the use of powerful anti-mitotic agents such as vincristine (VCR). VCR targets the microtubule cytoskeleton and disrupts important cellular processes, leading to cell death. Nonetheless, around 20% of patients relapse and become resistant to most drugs. At present, mechanisms of resistance toward VCR remain elusive despite its extensive clinical use, warranting a more in-depth study with respect to ALL. Five VCR-resistant (VCR-R) subclones were established by gradually exposing five ALL VCR-sensitive (VCR-S) cell lines (Jurkat, REH, SEM, RS4;11, 697) to incremental doses of VCR. Comparing resistant to sensitive cells, the IC50 at 48h increased 3-6 logs. Both VCR-S and VCR-R cell lines were subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining. After a 48h exposure to VCR, cell death for VCR-S cells was the result of a typical G2/M phase arrest. In contrast, a G2/M phase arrest did not precede the VCR-induced cell death of VCR-R cells. VCR-R subclones were also observed to be more resistant to vinblastine, an alternative tubulin binding agent. In addition, there was increased resistance towards other chemotherapeutic drugs such as prednisolone, dexamethasone, daunorubicin and doxorubicin, indicating that resistance to VCR may contribute to cross-resistance after a prolonged incubation. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is known to play important roles in cancer cell proliferation and survival. The combination of inhibitors with other chemotherapeutic agents also has the potential to enhance leukemic cell death. To further investigate if the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is involved in VCR resistance, we screened a panel of twelve kinase inhibitors (Merck) which selectively targets this pathway. Interestingly, PDK1/Akt/Flt Dual Pathway Inhibitor KP372-1, was highly potent toward all cell lines with IC50 less than 100nM. Our results also showed that the administration of PI3K Inhibitor VIII, Akt Inhibitor IV and PI-103, as well as pan-selective PI3K inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002 in combination with VCR was able to promote increased levels of cell death. Cell cycle analysis also revealed that the combination treatment elicits different methods of cell death between VCR-S and VCR-R cells. This is especially evident upon the co-treatment with pan-selective inhibitors. Optimising the sensitivity of ALL cells and/or reversing resistance to VCR promise to maximise the therapeutic value of this important chemotherapy. This study provides evidence that VCR resistance potentially contributes to cross-resistance. Our data also shows that the PI3K-Akt pathway may be involved in VCR resistance in ALL, providing a valid rationale for further studies and the future application of inhibitors in clinical settings.']",

The majority of pts (95%) were observed to have typical b3a2 (63%) and b2a2 (32%) BCR-ABL transcript types; 3% of pts had both typical transcripts and 2% had atypical transcripts (e1a2, e19a2, b3a3). The incidence of BL mutations was higher in patients with b3a2 transcripts compared with b2a2 (46% vs. 32%, p = 0.03). Response to nilotinib was similar regardless of transcript type (Table). A two-sample 2 test of the four endpoints (CHR, CyR, MMR, and PFS) did not show a significant difference (p > 0.05) between the b2a2 and b3a2 populations. Modeling results demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the response dynamics between the major BCR-ABL transcript types. Conclusions', ' These data suggest that nilotinib is effective in patients with all BCR-ABL transcript types including those with atypical transcripts.

Mcl1, an anti-apoptotic protein that has been linked to increased survival and chemotherapy resistance in various cancers, can be indirectly modulated through transient inhibition of Cdk9 due to it having a short-lived transcript and being a labile protein. Transient inhibition of Cdk9, therefore, represents a potential therapeutic opportunity in tumors dependent on Mcl1 for survival, including various hematological malignancies. AZ5576 is a potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of Cdk9 that inhibits Cdk9 enzyme activity with an IC50 <5nM and decreases phosphorlyation of Ser2-RNAPII in cells with an IC50 of 96nM. In the MLL-fusion containing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) line, MV411, short-term treatment with AZ5576 led to a rapid dose-dependent decrease in pSer2-RNAPII with concomitant loss of Mcl1 mRNA and protein, resulting in the cleavage and activation of caspase 3 and loss of cell viability. However, protein expression of other Bcl2 family members (e.g. Bcl2, BclxL, Bim) remained unchanged. Further, AZ5576 induced rapid caspase activation and loss of viability in a diverse set of hematological cancer cell lines, including those from acute myeloid leukemia (16/20), multiple myeloma (10/19), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (8/13). In vivo efficacy with intermittent dosing of AZ5576 was also demonstrated in multiple xenograft models from each hematological tumor type. Finally, AZ5576 was still able to induce loss of viability in various multiple myeloma lines cultured in the presence of cytokines or bone marrow stromal cells that represent potential protective effects of the tumor microenvironment. Together, these results highlight the therapeutic potential for selective CDK9 inhibition in the treatment of hematological malignancies.']",

In BC CML, granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) acquire the ability to function as leukemic stem cells (LSCs), and are thought to act as a reservoir for TKI resistance. While long-term remission in BC CML is possible with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, only a minority of patients are eligible for transplantation, and may experience high morbidity and mortality. Safe and effective BC CML therapy will likely have to target the BC LSC population to ensure long-term disease control.Recent studies have shown the importance of the MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase (MNK1/2)-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) axis in sustaining BC LSC self renewal.

        "Background":"['Precursor-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Pre-B ALL) corresponds to most leukemia cases. Pre-B ALL in children younger than 12 months-old is characterized by a high total leukocytes count, central nervous system (CNS) infiltration and KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-r), whereby patients are directed to a high risk treatment protocol. Searching for new additional prognostic biomarkers, especially those that can better predict CNS involvement are needed. It has been reported that osteopontin (OPN) is able to anchor bone-marrow leukemic blasts, protecting these cells from chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity and that circulating OPN has been correlated to blast CNS infiltration. Until now, data regarding OPN in ALL and other non-solid tumors are only correlated to full lenght OPN. However, OPN suffers alternative splicing, generating three splicing isoforms (OPN-SI), named OPNa, OPNb and OPNc. This study aims to evaluate whether OPN-SIs could differently contribute to risk stratification of childhood Pre-B ALL harboring or not the KMT2A-r. This study included 34 childhood Pre-B ALL patients, whose several clinical data, including the status of KMT2A-r are available. Total RNA from bone marrow blast cells have been extracted using the RNeasy (QIAGEN) mini kit and then cDNA has been synthesized. OPN-SI expression has been analyzed by qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR using isoform specific oligonucleotides. Using the qualitative RT-PCR approach, we showed that most patient samples express the 3 OPN-SI (48.64%). Other 10.8% of these cases expressed OPNa and OPNb isoforms, while 13.51% expressed OPNa and OPNc. Only 8.1% of these samples expressed only OPNa or OPNc isoforms. These data showed that OPNa isoform is expressed in most patient samples, followed by OPNc. We also observed that OPNa expression seems to be correlated to the occurrence of KMT2A-r. Considering OPN-SI expression levels, most patient samples (47.05%) overexpress OPNa. Among those patients that harbor the KMT2A-r, 35.29% of them express similar OPN-SI expression levels, while 32.9% overexpress OPNa and 20% overexpress OPNc. Only 5.88% overexpress OPNb. Among those patient samples that lack KMT2A-r, a higher proportion overexpress OPNa, followed by those that overexpress OPNb, or OPNc or have similar levels of the 3 OPN splice variants. As a whole, our data demonstrate that OPNa isoform is the OPN splice variant expressed in most Pre-B ALL samples, besides being overexpressed in relation to OPNb and OPNc isoforms. Our data also provide evidence that OPNa splice variant expression data could contribute to risk stratification in Pre-B ALL patients, correlated to the occurrence of KMT2A-r, besides being the first study of OPN-SI in non-solid tumors, especially in ALL. Ongoing studies will better better investigate the correlation between OPN-SI expression and additional prognostic data, including KMT2A-r.']",

This drug is currently used in the treatment of several haemotological malignancies; among them Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). CLL is the most common leukemia in Western countries and is characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal CD5+ B cells in the blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen and other organs. The pathways facilitating the uptake of bendamustine hydrochloride into target cells still remain poorly understood. Here we have addressed this issue by monitoring the interaction of the drug with selected plasma membrane transporter candidates, which might be relevant to bendamustine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We have used a panel of HEK293 cells stably expressing selected drug transporter proteins to prove that bendamustine is able to interact with human Organic Cation Transporter 1 (hOCT1) with a Ki of 140+/-10 M, as deduced from cis-inhibition studies using tritiated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) as hOCT model substrate. Genetic variants known to modify substrate/transporter interactions, some of them with high allelic frequency in humans, were also tested and, in particular, hOCT1M420Del showed a significant decrease in its affinity for the drug (Ki value 234+/-24 M, p<0.05 vs the wild type transporter). The whole panel of hOCT1 and hOCT1 allelic variants were also tested for bendamustine-induced cytotoxicity and data consistent with bendamustine being a hOCT1 substrate were obtained. This was based upon the finding that hOCT1 expression triggered increased sensitivity to the drug and variants known to decrease drug-transporter affinity interactions were also shown to induce resistance. hOCT1 is expressed in CLL cells and genotyping of a cohort of 125 CLL patients is now allowing the analysis of the relationships between particular genetic variants and ex vivo bendamustine-induced cytotoxicity, thus opening the possibility that hOCT1 genotyping might be a useful tool in optimizing bendamustine-based therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that regulates the functional stability of client oncoproteins, which is driven by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The geldanamycin analog, 17-AAG, binds to the ATP pocket of HSP90 leading to the degradation of client proteins such as Akt, p53, STAT3, Bcr-Abl, and Pim-1. Pim (Pim-1, -2, -3) kinases are constitutively active serine/threonine kinases overexpressed in hematological malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Pim kinases have several substrates which are involved in gene transcription, protein translation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. AZD1208 is a small molecule Pim kinase inhibitor currently in clinical trials. The PI3K-dependent activation of AKT (a client protein of HSP90) and the JAK/STAT-dependent induction of PIM are partially overlapping kinase pathways. Therefore, we hypothesized that the mechanism-based combination of 17-AAG (to decrease AKT levels) with AZD1208 (to inhibit Pim kinases) will result in an increase in cytotoxicity in CLL cells. An AZD1208 dose-response experiment was performed in 4 CLL patient samples to determine the optimal cytotoxic concentrations. AZD1208 concentrations of 3 M and 10 M were selected to treat 22 additional CLL patient samples for 24 hours. Cell death ranged from 0-30% and 2-45%, respectively, as determined by Annexin-V/PI staining after subtraction of endogenous cell death. All CLL patient samples were sensitive to AZD1208 regardless of their prognostic markers such as IgVH mutation and ZAP70 positivity or cytogenetics such as 17p del (p53 locus) or 11q del (ATM locus). Similarly, prior treatment history or Rai stage did not influence the biological response of AZD1208 in CLL cells. Based on published data, 0.5 M and 2 M 17-AAG were selected for the combination treatments with AZD1208 for 24 and 48 hours. Cytotoxicity for these combinations was assessed in 13 CLL blood samples, resulting in additive (n=8) or more than additive (n=3) cell death when using the fractional two-drug combination analysis. Immunoblot analysis was performed in 3 CLL samples probing for HSP90, HSP70, Akt, Pim-1, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), 4E-BP1, and -actin. In agreement with previous work, 17-AAG treatment resulted in an increase of HSP90 and HSP70 protein levels while Akt levels were markedly decreased. In these preliminary immunoblots, Pim-1 and Bcl-2 levels remained unchanged; however, Mcl-1 protein levels decreased in the combination treatments at 24 and 48 hours. Levels for total and phospho-4E-BP1 also declined. Taken together, these preliminary data indicate that AZD1208 (at 3 and 10 M) has a modest cytotoxic effect in CLL cells. However, when combined with 17-AAG for 24 and 48 hours there was an additive or more than additive effect in majority of CLL samples, with the possible mechanisms of action being through the Akt and 4E-BP1 pathways.']",

        "Background":"['The Hedgehog(Hh) signaling pathway is activated in most hematological and solid cancers and is a promising target for therapeutic development. Deletions in the receptor Patched (PTCH) or activating mutations in the upstream positive regulator Smoothened(SMO) have been reported in a few cancers such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but are largely absent in most tumor types; therefore, the mechanism of pathway activation in most cancers remains unknown. In normal tissues, Hh pathway activation via PTCH/SMO causes an increase in the downstream activating transcription factor GLI1 and a decrease in the transcriptional repressor GLI3R. We confirm that the Hh pathway is active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is required for cell survival, however, this activity is largely independent of the upstream activator SMO. Using siRNA knock down of GLI1, GLI3 and SMO in AML cell lines, Gli3 conditional knock out mice, and primary AML samples, we are able to show that loss of the GLI3R repressor function is sufficient to activate Hh target gene expression independent of ligand binding, and GLI3R levels correlate inversely with GLI1 levels. Importantly, we show that GLI3R is required for the therapeutic effect of SMO antagonists in AML samples and restoration of GLI3R restores sensitivity to SMO antagonists in AML cell lines. Epigenetic and gene expression analysis of the TCGA AML data set reveals that the GLI3 expression is silenced in most AML patient samples. We demonstrate in vitro and in patients that treatment with hypomethylating agents restores GLI3R levels and sensitivity to SMO antagonists in AML. In a transgenic mouse model of myeloproliferative disease (vav-Jak2V617F, gift of Joe Zhao, OUHSC) effective treatment with SMO antagonists are associated with increases in GLI3R but no changes in GLI1. Finally we show that GLI3R can directly repress expression of AKT and in vivo responses to SMO antagonists are correlated with changes in AKT expression, independent of GLI1 levels. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that GLI3R plays an essential role in SMO independent Hh signaling in AML, and suggests that GLI3R could serve as a potential biomarker for patient selection in SMO antagonist clinical trials. Furthermore, these data provide important mechanistic data to support rational combinations of hypomethylating agents with SMO antagonists in clinical trials.']",

        "Background":"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer of childhood. Two major challenges in the therapy of B-lineage ALL are overcoming acquired drug resistance and treatment of relapse. The interaction of ALL cells with the bone marrow microenvironment is thought to assist the development of resistance to therapeutic drugs. Therefore, we are focusing on the bone marrow microenvironment as a possible target for treatment by investigating the interactions between cell surface receptors on the ALL cells that are engaged by factors produced in the bone marrow. Recently, we were the first to report that pre-B ALL cells express the B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R). In the current study, we used a fusion protein, consisting of the toxin Gelonin (a plant toxin which inhibits protein synthesis by inactivating ribosomes) and the ligand for the BAFF-R, BAFF/BLys for selective killing of ALL cells. Gelonin cannot enter the cells by itself since it lacks the ability to bind to the cell surface. Here, we demonstrate that rGel/BLyS binds to ALL cells expressing BAFF-R and, upon internalization, it induces apoptosis of these cells and causes down-regulation of survival genes even in the presence of stromal protection. Further, we transplanted human leukemic cells into NSG mice and allowed the cells to proliferate for 6 days to form an appreciable tumor burden. Then 3.75 mg/kg rGel/BLyS was administered bi-weekly for 3 weeks. Mice not receiving treatment had to be sacrificed at around day 34 whereas mice treated with rGel/BLyS survived significantly (p<0.002) longer. Remarkably, FACS analysis of peripheral blood from mice treated with rGel/BLyS, using human CD19 and CD10 antibodies, showed that the treatment had eliminated virtually all circulating leukemia cells. However, the bone marrow (BM) of these mice clearly contained leukemic cells. We used AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, to mobilize the ALL cells protected in the bone marrow microenvironment, in combination with rGel/BLyS. In the combination treatment group, mice were first treated with rGel/BLyS alone to reduce the overall leukemia burden. Then the combination treatment was initiated, with AMD3100 injected 5-6 hours before the rGel/BLyS was administered. This strategy was used to ensure the presence of ALL cells in circulation at the time when the toxin would also be in the circulation. The combination treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the tumor load in the bone marrow and complete eradication of ALL cells from the circulation. To conclude, rGel/BLyS is a very promising therapeutic agent for ALL with selective cytotoxicity mediated by its fusion to the ligand for the BAFF-R. Moreover, by combining this selective but toxic fusion protein with a non-toxic ALL mobilizing agent, we were able to significantly deplete the pool of malignant lymphoblasts in vivo that could form the basis for relapse in the bone marrow.']",

        "Background":"[\"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is, despite the introduction of second generation TKI's, the standard first-line therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Early response to therapy is correlated to long-term therapeutic effect in CML. To be able to switch to second generation TKI's in an early stage of CML, it would be advantageous to identify predictive markers for failure on imatinib. Imatinib is metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, forming approximately 30 metabolites. The main metabolite, CGP74588, is pharmacologically active with similar potency to that of imatinib. CGP74588 is present in 20% of imatinib plasma concentrations but with a large inter-individual variation. We have previously reported that high CYP3A activity is associated with a better therapeutic outcome of imatinib, indicating a clinical significance of imatinib metabolites (Gren et al. 2010). Furthermore, imatinib is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein which is the product of the ABCB1 gene. Several ABCB1 polymorphisms have been described and some have been shown to influence the therapeutic response to imatinib in CML patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ABCB1 over-expression on the in vitro resistance to imatinib and its CYP3A metabolite CGP74588. ABCB1 wild type human cDNA was infected to the CML cell line K562 using a retroviral system. Co-expression of ABCB1 and the reporter gene for enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) was used for the assessment of ABCB1 expression by the analysis of EYFP in FACS. The influence of ABCB1 expression on the cytotoxic effects of imatinib and CGP74588 was assessed using MTT assays. FACS analysis of EYFP confirmed an over-expression of ABCB1 in infected K562 cells with a mean fluorescence intensity of 23.5 compared to 0.55 in parental K562 cells. ABCB1-expressing cells (K562/ABCB1) were slightly, but not significantly, more resistance to imatinib than K562 cells (IC50 K562 = 0.41M, K562/ABCB1 = 0.50M). However, ABCB1 expression induced a 12-fold increase in resistance when cells were treated with the imatinib metabolite CGP74588 (IC50 K562 = 0.72M, K562/ABCB1 = 8.53M, p = <0.000). Recent reports have shown that CGP74588 accumulates in cell lines with acquired multi-drug resistance and high P-gp expression. Our studies on cells with ABCB1 expression as a single resistance mechanism proves that P-gp is indeed confer resistance to CGP74588 in CML cells. Furthermore, CGP74588 cytotoxicity is affected by ABCB1 expression to a greater extent than imatinib itself, indicating that ABCB1 activity could be important for CGP74588 plasma and target cell concentrations in vivo and might contribute to the large intra-individual variation seen in patient plasma concentrations. Future studies will be needed to determine the clinical significance of P-gp activity and CGP74588 pharmacokinetics in relation to TKI therapy of CML.\"]",

For cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, CEBPA, TET2 and IDH1/2 are thought to have potential predictive utility and may impact patient management with regard to initial and consolidation therapy, including stem cell transplantation. As most potentially clinically relevant variants currently are not tested for within the diagnostic setting, we established a high-throughput multiplex assay capable of simultaneous detection of a range of somatic mutations in hematologic malignancies. Using iPlex chemistry and the Sequenom MassARRAY platform, we established the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM) Hematologic Malignancies Panel v1.0, comprised of 110 individual assays profiling 186 mutations in 22 relevant genes, in a 16-well assay format. We conducted an in silico analysis to identify genes with hotspot mutations capable of being analyzed by Sequenom; genes with mutations distributed throughout the coding sequence (e.g., CEBPA, TET2) were excluded from the panel. To best integrate this technology in the workflow of our routine clinical molecular diagnostic testing we developed the PM Panel as an RNA-based test, requiring 1 g of patient RNA for the initial reverse transcription reaction. To validate the assay we tested 222 patient-derived samples, including 5 normal samples, 82 AML (57 with normal cytogenetics, 24 with cytogenetic changes and 1 therapy-related), 44 myelodysplastic syndromes, 32 myeloproliferative neoplasms, 21 additional cases tested for KIT mutation, and 38 B-lymphoid malignancies (including 3 multiple myeloma cases),. Concordance with established lab assays for NPM1, FLT3-TKD and JAK2 mutations was 100%; other identified mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing at 98% concordance (2% of cases were below the limit of sensitivity of Sanger technology). Approximately 50% of samples were positive for at least one mutation with 174 mutations detected overall. Cytogenetically normal AMLs and myelodysplastic syndromes were most informative, with 2.3 and 1.8 mutations per positive case respectively. Samples already known to carry a leukemogenic driver fusion protein (e.g., PML-RAR, AML1-ETO, or BCR-ABL) had a significantly decreased identified somatic mutation load than their cytogenetically normal counterparts (average of 1.4 mutations per case, compared to 0.3, p < 10^-6). The PM Hematologic Malignancies Panel v1.0 is now being integrated into the current clinical diagnostic workflow. We therefore report the development of a versatile, RNA-based high-throughput multiplex platform for the identification of somatic mutations present in hematologic malignancies for use in a clinical diagnostic setting.']",

        "Background":"['Defects in apoptosis regulation are known to impact chemotherapy resistance and consequently refractoriness and relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We previously showed that apoptosis-resistant protein profile of AML blasts at diagnosis is associated with shorter disease-free survival. Specifically, by flow cytometry, we measured the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and Bax in leukemic cells and combined these parameters to define their anti-apoptosis index (AAI). Interestingly, the AAI of normal lymphocytes in the AML patients corresponded to the AAI of AML blasts obtained from the same patient, reaching values far outside the normal AAI range of lymphocytes. In addition, the AAI in both cell types displayed parallel changes during the course of therapy. This points to a role of microenvironment in regulation of apoptosis in bone marrow cells of AML patients. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess if apoptosis-resistant AML cells are able to regulate the AAI of apoptosis-sensitive cells by influencing the microenvironment, as well as to perform molecular dissection of microenvironment, to identify novel proteins that regulate apoptosis.First, we showed that apoptosis-resistant AML blasts (high AAI) release factors that modulate sensitive AML blasts (low AAI) to upregulate Bcl-2 and become apoptosis-resistant. In the majority of cases (10 out of 14), Bcl-2 expression was significantly increased in apoptosis-sensitive AML blasts upon contact culture with apoptosis-resistant AML blasts (1.7-fold; p=0.0067). To characterize the AML microenvironment, conditioned medium (18 hrs) from patient samples displaying either apoptosis-resistant (n=5) or apoptosis-sensitive profile (n=6) were collected. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, comparative analysis was performed on these secretomes. Strikingly, we found that the major functional protein clusters upregulated in secretomes of the apoptosis-resistant AML were involved in mRNA splicing, protein translation and chromatin remodeling/chromosome organization. We further compared protein profiles of the soluble secretome and the extracellular vesicle fraction of a high AAI patient to those of a low AAI patient. Proteomic analysis of these fractions of the conditioned medium showed that the functional protein networks found in the whole secretome are well-represented in extracellular vesicles that are enriched for exosome markers.Transfer of functional proteins between cells by extracellular vesicles is a well documented phenomenon. Therefore, it is conceivable that the regulatory protein networks detected in the vesicles excreted by AML blasts are involved in regulation of apoptosis-related proteins in recipient AML blasts and other cells residing in the bone marrow, thereby contributing to therapy resistance.

A recent study by Stransky et. al. reported systemic analysis of the transcriptome of nearly 7000 human tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas and revealed the landscape of near twenty kinase fusions across twenty solid tumor types. Identification of corresponding PDX models that carry given kinase fusions would be of paramount interest for preclinical validation of candidate inhibitors. We have established about 1000 PDX models across 20 tumor types. Here we report the identification of ALK, ROS1, FGFR2 fusions in lung cancer PDX models and a NRG1 fusion in the ovarian cancer models by RNA using Sequencing data combined with the Chimerascan and Star-Fusion software for fusion calling.. The gene fusions, as validated by PCR and Sanger Sequencing, led to over-expression of the affected kinases, supporting the notion that kinase activation may be the oncogenic driver in the corresponding tumors. We further validated that ALK inhibitors Crizotinib, AP26113 and LDK378 exhibited robust antitumor activities in the ALK fusion model. Current works on validation of ROS1, FGFR2 and NRG1 inhibitors in the pertinent fusion models are under progression. These models should provide means for pre-clinical validation of novel kinase inhibitors and for experimenting novel combinatorial therapeutic strategies.']",

        "Background":"['Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation contributes to leukemia development and growth, and that targeted pathway inhibition is likely to offer an efficient therapeutic opportunity. PF-04449913, a Hh pathway inhibitor, is a new selective and potent inhibitor of leukemia self-renewal and is currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials. In order to identify new potential clinical biomarkers for the PF-04449913, we studied CD34+ leukemia stem cell population (LSC) collected before and after 28 days treatment in a phase I dose escalation protocol (Clinical Trial Gov. NTC00953758) enrolling selected hematological malignancies. This experimental clinical trial enrolled Myelofibrosis (MF), MDS, blastic phases CML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and AML patients (pts). We were able to collect and separate highly purified (98%) bone marrow CD34+ cells from 5 AML, 1 MF and 2 CML pts by immunomagnetic separation, and analysed them for gene expression profile using Affimetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform. 1197 genes were differentially expressed between CD34+ cells collected before and after 28 days of PF-04449913 dose finding oral therapy. Clustering of their expression profiles showed that mostly genes differentially expressed are mainly related to Hh signaling, this providing further evidences that PF-04449913 really therapeutically targets the Hh pathway. Regarding genes involved in Hh signaling pathway, Gas1 and Kif27 were strongly upregulated (fold change 1.0947 and 1.12757 respectively; p-value 0.01 and 0.02 respectively) in CD34+ LSC after 28 days exposure to PF-04449913 as compared to baseline, suggesting these two genes have potential as new biomarkers of activity. GAS-1 is a Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-binding protein; it acts to sequester Shh and inhibit the Shh signalling pathway. Kif27 mainly acts as a negative regulator in the Hh signaling pathway, and inhibits the transcriptional activator activity of Gli1 by inhibiting its nuclear translocation. Other genes were differentially expressed after ex- vivo treatment with PF-04449913 as compared to baseline', ' we observed a down regulation of Bcl2 (fold change -1.03004), ABCA2 (fold change -1.08966), LEF1 (fold change -1.28457), Gli1 (fold change -1.0775), Smo (fold change -1.07702), and an upregulation of Gli2 (fold change 1.08191). Conclusions', ' This data demonstrates that PF-04449913 specifically targets the Hh Pathway in CD34+ cells, suggesting that Hh inhibition may impair leukemia stem cell maintenance. In addition, we identify several new potential biomarkers (e.g. Gas1 and KIF27). Taken together, these data may be useful for pts selection strategies and subsequent eradication of the LSC.

        "Background":"['CML is an uncontrolled proliferation of bone marrow myeloid cells driven by the constitutively active fusion product tyrosine kinase BCR/ABL. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is newly recognized as a factor in CML progression. Exosomes, released by a broad spectrum of cells, are microvesicles that play an important role in cell-to-cell communication both in physiological and pathological conditions. The role of exosomes released by CML cells in angiogenesis is emerging; however, little is known about the mechanisms involved in this process. We first isolated and characterized exosomes released by K562 CML cells and we demonstrated their ability to stimulate human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) tube differentiation on Matrigel. K562 exosomes induced an increase of the cumulative tube length in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum effect at 10ug/ml (p=0.003). Next, we evaluated the effect on exosome behavior of imatinib and dasatinib, two tyrosine kinase inhibitors in use in CML treatment. K562 CML cell treatment with either imatinib or dasatinib reduced exosome release by 58% and 56%, respectively (p<0.01). Equivalent exosome concentrations isolated from imatinib or dasatinib treated K562 cells maintained their ability to stimulate HUVEC tube formation, compared to those isolated from untreated cells. Dasatinib treatment of HUVECs strongly reduced exosome-induced vascular differentiation (p=0.0002). On the contrary, little effect was observed following treatment with imatinib. K562 exosomes stimulated vascularization when added to Matrigel plug in vivo; angiogenesis was markedly inhibited by oral administration of dasatinib (p<0.01), but not imatinib. Consistent with the differential effects of dasatinib and imatinib, exosome-induced HUVEC Src and FAK phosphorylation was only inhibited by dasatinib. Confocal images showed that both FAK and Src phosphorylation were increased at points of membrane-matrix contact. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that K562 exosomes induced a dasatinib-sensitive phosphorylation of Src and FAK and their downstream effectors, Erk and Akt. Again, imatinib was minimally active against exosome stimulation of HUVEC cell signaling. Thus, K562 CML exosomes stimulate angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo in a dasatinib-sensitive fashion. This credentials exosomes and angiogenesis as molecular targets in CML via activation of Src both in leukemia and its microenvironment.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Targeting Egr-1 is an effective strategy for overcoming kinase inhibitor resistance in CML",
        "Background":"['The primary oncogene associated with CML is BCR/ABL which controls proliferative and survival signaling and is a potent inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS play both positive and negative roles in proliferation and survival; this dual nature has been exploited by leukemia cells to promote growth, genomic instability, and drug resistance. However, the distinct molecular alterations that occur as a result of BCR/ABL-induced ROS are not well described. BCR/ABL-targeted therapeutics have improved clinical response rates, therefore the number of CML patients living with detectable disease burden is rising. Complete hematologic responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy are seen in 10-30% of CML patients, so acquired drug resistance and relapse remain major issues. Thus, novel targets for combined therapeutics are needed. We have shown that early growth response 1 (Egr-1) is a BCR/ABL-dependent, redox-responsive transcription factor that modulates expression of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn in CML leading to proliferation and survival. Tissue microarray analysis of 26 CML patients (10 chronic phase, 6 accelerated phase, and 10 blast crisis), corroborated by western blotting on independent patient samples, showed that Egr-1 protein expression increased as CML progresses from chronic phase to the more treatment resistant accelerated phase and blast crisis. Egr-1 protein expression was also elevated 2.5 fold in a model of acquired pan-TKI resistance (K562-STI) when compared with parental K562 cells. When Egr-1 was genetically inhibited, proliferation of K562-STI cells decreased by 56%. Egr-1 knockdown was also sufficient to sensitize K562-STI cells to growth inhibition caused by first and second generation BCR/ABL-directed TKI, further implicating Egr-1 in acquired TKI resistance. Egr-1 is well known as a redox-responsive transcription factor, and we found that ROS were elevated in K562-STI vs. K562 cells. While analysis of mitochondrial respiration using a Seahorse Bioanalyzer showed no increase in mitochondrial respiration, spare respiratory capacity, nor proton leak in K562-STI vs. K562, there remained a basal level of oxygen consumption from non-mitochondrial sources in both cell lines. Interestingly, fluorigenic and western blotting assays showed increases in NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity (1.35 fold) and p47phox (2 fold), an essential component of the NOX complex, respectively in K562-STI cells, suggesting NOX as a source of ROS in these cells. To this end, inhibition of the NOX complex with diphenyleneiodonium decreased ROS levels and Egr-1 expression by 50% in K562-STI but not K562 cells. These data suggest that K562-STI have altered regulation of Egr-1 controlled, in part, by NOX. Together, our findings suggest that targeting the transcription factor Egr-1 directly, or through the NOX complex, may be beneficial for improving outcomes for CML patients.']",

We tested the activity of two GQIDs, GQC-05 and GSA-1103, on cell growth of a panel of eight pediatric and eight adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Drug dose response analysis showed IC50 values ranging from approximately 10 nM to 1 M for GQC-05 and from 40 nM to 2 M for GSA-1103.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' In the treatment of acute leukemia, much of the therapeutic effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is centered on engraftment of donor cells into the host, with a resultant graft versus leukemia effect. Work previously done by our group and others has shown the infusion of haploidentical stem cells in patients with acute leukemia results in a cytokine storm and exhibits an anti-tumor effect in the absence of engraftment. Whether the underlying clinical response was due to this cytokine storm or secondary to host or donor effector cell interactions was not determined. We present in vitro data collected from leukemia patients in which patient CD3+ cells are stimulated with randomly selected unrelated normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The stimulated patient CD3+ cells are then collected and tested for their ability to lyse leukemia cells from the patient.Methods', ' New leukemia patients were identified through standard pathologic diagnostic criteria. Patient samples were collected and separated into CD3+ and CD3- fractions. Patient CD3+ cells were then placed in a mixed lymphocyte culture and stimulated with mitomycin C treated unrelated normal donor PBMC. Cell proliferation was measured on Day 5. On Day 7, the stimulated patient CD3+ cells were collected and then cultured with Chromium 51 labeled CD3- cells, the bulk of which were leukemic blast cells. Cytolytic activity was measured through Cr51 release assays. Cell lysis was recorded as lytic units/million cells (LU/106), which is inversely related to the effector to target ratio at which 30% cell lysis occurs. Patient demographic data including sex and age in addition to leukemia type, cytogenetics, and molecular markers were recorded.Results', ' 10 total patients were enrolled in the study; 8 AML, 1 CML, and 1 CMML. 9 patients underwent ex vivo CD3+ stimulation with 2 separate donor PBMC samples while 1 sample underwent only 1 donor stimulation for 19 total assays. The average white blood cell count was 57,640 cells/uL (range 7,100-336,500 cells/ul) with 4-80% peripheral blasts. 7 out of 19 (37%) assays showed leukemia cell cytolytic activity greater than 1 lytic unit. All 7 successful assays were derived from patients with AML (Table 1).Conclusions', ' Patient CD3+ cells stimulated with random unrelated donor PBMC are able to generate a cytolytic anti-leukemia response in a donor dependant fashion. This cytolytic activity appears to be unrelated to host lymphocyte proliferation upon donor antigenic stimulation. Interestingly, of the seven assays with cytolytic activity greater than one lytic unit, four were performed in the two patients with known FLT3 ITD positive leukemia, which has a notoriously poor prognosis. Further studies to elucidate a mechanism of action for cellular therapy are warranted.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in the western world. It is characterized by the clonal expansion of CD5+CD23+ B cells in blood, marrow, and second lymphoid tissues. Survival of CLL cells are supported by cells within the tissue microenvironment and by signals from the extracellular matrix, which in part are mediated via interactions with CD44, a surface glycoprotein that is expressed by CLL B cells and by putative cancer stem cells. CD44 interacts with other surface and cytosolic proteins expressed by CLL cells such as CD38, CD49d, MMP9 and ZAP-70, which enhanced signaling leading to growth or survival of CLL cells. We found that a mAb specific for CD44 was directly cytotoxic for leukemia B cells, but had little effect on normal B cells. It could induce CLL cells that expressed the zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) to undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis (Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 2013, PMID', ' 23530247). The cytotoxic effect of this mAb was not mitigated when the CLL cells were co-cultured with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), suggesting that targeting CD44 may provide an effective approach for anti-cancer therapy.A6 is an 8-amino acid peptide (Ac-KPSSPPEE-Am) that binds to the CD44 receptor within a region of the ligand-binding domain and induces anti-metastatic and anti-migration activity against a variety of cancers including ovarian, lung, and breast cancers. In this study we examined the cytotoxic effects and explored mechanism of A6 peptide against multiple CLL patient samples.We found that A6 peptide exhibits a significant cytotoxic effect against CLL patient samples (N=22) in vitro while having negligible toxicity against healthy patient B cell samples (N=6). A6 also exhibits cytotoxic effects against CLL cells in a dose dependent manner. More importantly, we found that A6 is able to down-modulate CD44 expression, leading to down regulation of CD44-associated proteins (e.g. ZAP-70). Because ZAP-70 can directly enhance BCR signaling, reduction of ZAP-70, following A6 treatment resulted in attenuation of intracellular [Ca2++] flux after IgM ligation, which is an indicator of decrease in BCR signaling. Moreover, A6 exhibits significantly greater direct cytotoxicity for CLL cells (p=0.029) that express ZAP-70 than for CLL cells that were ZAP-70 negative. We transplanted primary ZAP-70 positive CLL patient samples (N=2) into the peritoneal cavity of immunodeficient mice. Intraperitoneal treatment with 300 mg/kg of A6 peptide twice daily for 7 days resulted in a significant reduction of CLL burden (90% and 64.2%) compared to PBS treated control groups. No significant adverse effects were observed. A6 peptide has been very well-tolerated in clinical trials with no clearly identifed systemic adverse events in patients with solid tumors who have been treated to date (N = 40). Thus, A6 presents a promising therapeutic agent not only against CLL but also against CD44 expressing cancer stem cells.']",

        "Background":"['Many human cancers are composed of heterogeneous populations of cells. While most cancer cells have a limited ability to divide, growth of the tumor is carried out by a small population of cancer stem cells, and hence represent the true target of effective anti-cancer therapy.To identify potential therapeutic targets, we previously studied the molecular signature of leukemia stem cells. Our work has led to the discovery of the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F6 (EAR-2) as a potential leukemia stem cell therapeutic target. We have previously shown that NR2F6 is over expressed in patients with acute leukemia and related bone marrow cancers, and that exogenous expression of NR2F6 in mouse bone marrow cells causes acute leukemia in vivo. Furthermore, silencing of NR2F6 expression in human and mouse-leukemia cell lines causes terminal differentiation and death by apoptosis. The discovery of the role of NR2F6 in leukemogenesis and the effects of silencing NR2F6 expression on leukemia cells suggests that this protein is a logical candidate as a therapeutic target in acute leukemia and related disorders for differentiation therapy. This forms the basis of the therapeutic concept that we wished to develop further, by identifying small molecule modulators of NR2F6 function.We hence developed a screening tool that was used to survey the ability of known nuclear receptor ligands to modulate NR2F6 activity. We constructed a hybrid receptor, comprising the NR2F6 ligand binding domain fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The hybrid receptor was co-transfected into HeLa cells along with a reporter plasmid in which a Gal4 regulatory sequence was placed upstream of a luciferase gene running off a constitutive promoter. The transfected cells were treated with candidate ligands and assayed for luciferase activity by luminometer. Of the 20 nuclear receptor ligands assessed none showed a significant effect at low concentrations (up to 1M). However, we identifying 9-cis retinoic acid and, to a lesser extent, all-trans retinoic as low affinity ligands for NR2F6 since they were able to show a dose-dependent effect that we began to observe at 20M.Retinoic acid and its analogues have long been studied in the context of chemoprevention and differentiation therapy based on their anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and ability to induce differentiation. We have now commenced the search for a high affinity small molecular inhibitor of NR2F6 activity by screening commercially available libraries that contain compounds with similar chemical structure to retinoic acid using the luciferase-based assay developed here.']",

NTC00953758) enrolling selected hematological malignancies including MF, MDS, CML, CMML and AML. We collected and separated highly purified (98%) bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+ populations) in 5 AML, 1 MF and 2 CML patients, by immunomagnetic separation, and analyzed them for gene expression profile (GEP) using Affimetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform.

Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), Bcl2l2 (Bcl2-like protein 2) and Bcl2l13 (Bcl2-like 13) are the founding members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulator proteins. Recent studies showed that Hh signals upregulate Bcl2 to promote cellular survival. Casp 4,7,10 (Caspases) are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation.

One mechanism of MDR is the increased expression of ABC drug transporters, resulting in low intracellular drug concentrations. We evaluated Gli1 and Smo expression by GEP, comparing data before and after 28 days of treatment with PF-04449913 and we observed a down regulation of both genes (fold changes 1.0775 and 1.07702 respectively).

A new class of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically targeting oxMIF demonstrated efficacy in vivo and inhibited signaling pathways associated with tumor proliferation and progression in vitro.By developing novel immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods we were able to differentially detect oxMIF and to determine biodistribution of human anti-oxMIF mAbs in human and animal-derived tissue.First, we observed by IHC that in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissue, oxMIF is specifically expressed in tumor cells and in tumor stroma within pancreatic intraepithelial lesions. In contrast, we could not detect oxMIF in healthy control tissue, whereas MIF (sum of oxMIF and its reduced isoform) was abundantly expressed in both, tissue from PDAC patients and tissue from healthy subjects.

The effects of imatinib mesylate on gastric cancer cells were examined in four human gastric cancer cell lines. The results showed expression of PDGFR in all four gastric cancer cells. We measured the sensitivity of gastric cancer cell line (AGS, MKN28, MKN45, SNU638) to imatinib mesylate using MTT assay. Cell viability of cell treated with imatinib mesylate was decreased in high dose. But cell viability was not change in high dose. Next, the results showed expression of PDGFR and suppression of its phosphorylation by imatinib mesylate in all four gastric cancer cells. Cell cycle analysis for sub-G1 and G2/M fraction also detected the increased cell death in the cells treated with imatinib mesylates. Results by Western blotting indicated that imatinib mesylates promotes apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by both activating caspase-3 and -9 and inducing PARP cleavage. And expression of p-AKT level was decreased. Cell migration and invasion that imatinib treated cells is decreased in low dose. Cell viability assay revealed that the combination of imatinib mesylate and chemo-reagent synergistically inhibited cell growth compared to cells treated with any of the agent alone.In conclusion, inhibition the PDGFR by imatinib mesylates lead to apoptosis of gastric cancer cell lines. And Imatinib suppressed motility and invasion of gastric cancer cells. The results suggest that imatinib mesylate may be useful in the treatment of gastric cancer.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['MiR182 is an evolutionarily conserved miR, present in a cluster with miR183, and miR96 on human chromosome 7q32.2. This cluster is over-expressed in hESCs, and iPSCs. Developmentally, miR182 is over-expressed during erythropoiesis from CD34 cells. Erythroid differentiation of CML cells induced by Imatinib treatment provides an alternate mechanism of Imatinib escape, and also emphasizes the need to explore miR182 function in this context. In cancerous cells, miR182 regulates metastasis in melanoma cells by regulation of MITF and FOXO3, and DNA repair in breast cancer by targeting BRCA1. These reports provide some understanding of miR182 function by transient in-vitro assays. To refine functional importance, targeted deletion of MIR182 has been done on mice retinal cells where it is shown an over-expressed candidate by quantitative methods; nevertheless MIR182 deletion does not show any phenotypic change indicating challenges to study their functions along with better model systems. We focus to study K562 cells, CML blast crisis cell line with wild type Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, partially differentiated cells able to differentiate in different lineages upon induction. We exploit use of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock-out approach to find out miR182 function in K562 cells. We show that we have successfully deleted MIR182 loci in K562 cells by CRISPR. We hypothesize if miR182 regulates proliferation or differentiation in bi-potent K562 cells. Using phenotypic characterization, we studied MIR182 deleted cells. We show that myeloid differentiation is augmented by MIR182 deletion. Homozygous MIR182 deleted cells display decreased proliferation. We find striking inverse correlation with notch signalling genes in the context of Imatinib resistance. Notch signalling has been documented in cancer cells where its role has been shown in context dependent which require more explanation of its regulation. Hes1, one of main transcriptional regulator of notch signalling pathway, is targeted by miR182 shown by both bio-informatics, and in-vitro assays. Hes1 manipulation confirms it as down-stream target of miR182 in CML cells. We next explored Imatinib resistance phenotype in the context of miR182 given its expression in CD34 cells. We demonstrate miR182 is over-expressed in CML cells towards Imatinib treatment in ex-vivo, and in-vitro. We find miR182 essential for proliferation of K562 cells, Imatinib resistance. Taken together, our studies highlight miR182 targets notch signalling genes in CML cells implication of which we have shown in the context of Bcr-Abl independent Imatinib resistance mediated by differentiation deregulation.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Although the bacterial enzyme L-asparaginase (L-ASP) has been used in combination with traditional cytotoxic therapy for decades, its use has been limited mainly to its FDA-approved treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By catalyzing the hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartate, L-ASP depletes serum levels of asparagine resulting in direct cytotoxicity of sensitive cells. The noncytotoxic effects of L-ASP, such as the inhibition of glycoprotein synthesis, have been known for decades. Our ongoing preclinical work has demonstrated that L-ASP reduces the ability of endothelial cells to form capillary-like tubes, reduces the invasive potential of endothelial cells and cancer cells, and prevents heterotypic interaction between ovarian cancer and endothelial cells. These results suggest that L-ASP may provide therapeutic benefit by inhibiting angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis.

        "Background":"['Background', 'Survival of cancer cells rely on the unfolded protein response (UPR) to resist stress triggered by the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IRE1-XBP1 pathway, one of the most important branches of the UPR, is activated in different types of cancer. Upon IRE1 activation, the spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s) is generated to activate the transcription of many pro-survival genes to prevent cellular death and relive cellular stress. Blockade of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway can thereby be considered as a potential anti-cancer strategy.Results & Clinical relevance', 'Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Here, we first examined the formation of the XBP1s in leukemia cell lines and AML samples from patients. Interestingly, spliced XBP1 was detectable in 85 % (22 of 26) of leukemia cell lines and 66 % (19 of 29) of AML samples from patients. Compared with normal mononuclear cells from normal individuals, XBP1s was significantly elevated in AML samples from patients (p=0.0043, n=28) as measured by QRT-PCR. 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (HNA) is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway, which specifically prevents the splicing of XBP1.HNA blocked both the basal and inducible (tunicamycin treatment) XBP1s in NB-4 and HL60 AML cells, as well as leukemic blasts from AML patients. Furthermore, HNA was able to decrease cellular viability of both AML cell lines (mean IC50=31M, n=8) and AML samples from patients (mean IC50=35M, n=18). In contrast, HNA had very low toxicity against normal human marrow mononuclear cells (mean IC50=123 M, n=4). Importantly, HNA caused a significant inhibition (mean IC50=6 M, n=6) of clonogenic growth in soft agar of AML cells from patients with different leukemic subtypes. The inhibitory effect trigged by HNA was at least in part mediated through the induction of important regulatory genes for apoptosis, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and downstream targets of XBP1, namely p53, PARP, p21cip1, p58IPK, CHOP and DNAJB9. Additionally, the combination of HNA with either arsenic trioxide (As2O3) or bortezomib exhibited a synergistic anti-proliferative effect against several human AML cell lines (NB-4 and U-937).

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) consists a promising type of adoptive immunotherapy. CARs consist of an antigen recognition unit (scFv), a transmembrane (TM) region and an intracellular activation domain. However, on target/off tumor responses due to target recognition in normal cells limits the widespread application of this therapy. In B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphocytes expressing anti-CD19 CARs (19BBz) are being used in the clinical setting. However, the expression of CD19 as a pan-B marker can lead to undesired side effects such as depletion of mature B cells. As mature B cells express both CD19 and CD20 antigens, we propose the creation of an inhibitory anti-CD20 CAR, that when used in combination with 19BBz would be able to discriminate between leukemic blasts and normal B cells. Methods and results', ' Three inhibitory CARs were constructed containing signaling domains of CTLA-4, PD-1 or BTLA. Jurkat T cells expressing the plasmid pGL4.30 - expressing luciferase controlled by a NFAT responsive promoter - were generated. K562 cell line was used as target cells and modified to express CD19 (K5-19), CD20 (K5-20) or CD19 and CD20 (K5-19/20). In coculture experiments, Jurkat cells expressing 19BBz showed induction of luciferase activity when cultured with K5-19 or K5-19/20. However, Jurkat expressing both activation and inhibitory CAR showed inhibition of luciferase activity when incubated with K5-19/20 while maintained high activity when cultured with K5-19 cells. Furthermore, all three inhibitory CARs were able to inhibit the expression of the activation marker CD69 induced by 19BBz. In primary human T lymphocytes, the 20PD1 CAR did not inhibit proliferation or cytotoxicity induced by 19BBz. Surprisingly, T cells expressing 19BBz and 20PD1 showed preferential lysis of NALM6 CD19+ CD20+ cells, suggesting that the addition of PD1 domain may increase T-cell function in specific contexts. This effect was partially reversed by using a mutant PD1 domain where the tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanine and was completely reversed by using an anti-CD20 CAR truncated at the TM region, suggesting that this phenomenon is dependent of signaling. Conclusions', ' Additional experiments are needed to evaluate the activity of 20PD1 in primary human T cells. Experiments with inhibitory CARs 20LAG3 and 20PD1LAG3 are ongoing and can serve as an alternative to CAR 20PD1 in the construction of a conditional response system.']",

Indeed, it was not observed activation of caspase 3, in contrast to an expressive activation of PARP. Interestingly, proteins associated to autophagy were overexpressed by Lucena cells, and an arrest of cell cycle was observed after exposition to the drug. Finally, it was verified that metformin was able to modulate activity of MMP2 and MMP9, enzymes associated to the metastatic process.

        "Background":"[\"Quorum sensing (QS) is a generic term describing cell-cell communication and collective decision making by bacteria and social insects to regulate expression of specific genes controlling cell density and other properties in response to changes in nutrient supply or environment. QS also has a role in higher organisms in maintaining homeostasis, regulation of the immune system and behavior of cancer cell populations. CML is a classic example of a tumor which without effective therapy consistently undergoes malignant progression, replacing the chronic phase (CP) cells with undifferentiated blast cells. Like most other types of acute leukemia including Ph+ ALL, the CML blasts proliferate slower than either normal or CP CML stem/progenitor (S/P) cells and individual blasts have greatly reduced proliferative potential and cloning ability suggesting the leukemic blasts achieve dominance by functioning as an aberrant ecosystem subject to different regulatory mechanisms than normal or CP CML S/P cells. To see if QS is involved we selected a p190 bcr-abl driven pre-B cell line (ALL3) derived from the pleural fluid of a patient dying of Ph+ ALL. Unlike other established human or murine Bcr-Abl driven lines, ALL3 cells don't form colonies or grow at low cell densities (LD) but grow progressively faster at increasing densities (HD). The cells are unresponsive to any known cytokines or combinations at any density. ALL3 cells at HD in upper inserts of transwells stimulate growth of LD cells in lower wells and LD ALL3 are also stimulated to grow by diffusible factors in the supernate (SN) of HD cells. Unstimulated LD ALL3 maintain fair viability (Trypan blue exclusion) for several days, and cells are also poised to begin proliferating; almost 98-100% are Ki-67+ and 40% incorporate BrdU, but an increasing number undergo apoptosis and only a minority regrow with addition of HD SN. The stimulatory factor(s) fail to stimulate other HD ALL3 cells, suggesting novel sensory circuits are activated upon population depletion or lack of close contact. LD ALL3 cells are also stimulated by SNs of enriched CD34+ cells at HD from normal PB, cord blood or CP CML but not by less enriched MNCs; it is not yet known if these stimulatory effects are due to the same or different factor(s). Our first objective is to identify the stimulatory protein(s) in the secretomes of HD ALL3 and other cells. The HD SN is stable upon storage at 4C or -80C with no loss of activity. Using cutoff filters all stimulatory activity is in the >30kDa Fx and with anion exchange chromatography activity is concentrated in 1 or 2 cationic flow-through sub-fractions. We are currently working with several proteomic experts to identify and characterize the stimulatory factors and the novel pathways and regulatory mechanisms involved. Our ultimate goal is to define the aberrant circuitries and find vulnerable targets for specific therapies of leukemias and other cancers.\"]",

        "Background":"[\"To date, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a poor-prognosis disease with only approximately 25% of patients surviving five years after being diagnosed (SEER  2005-2011). There are a wide variety of treatment options ranging from intense chemotherapy to targeted therapies. Beyond tolerability, identifying the ideal treatment strategy for each patient remains a difficult task. Mitochondrial profiling of AML patient samples using Bcl-2 homology domain (BH3) mimetics has proven to accurately identify patients that respond to several therapies in AML. In this method, cancer cells are exposed to BH3 mimetics designed to test for susceptibility to induction of apoptosis. The readout, called BH3-Priming indicates anti-apoptotic protein dependencies in cancer cells.In this study, samples from AML patients that were treated with at least one cycle of the hypomethylating agent, decitabine, at The Ohio State University were collected and BH3 profiled (n = 64). The patients were assessed for a complete response to the drug and were characterized by several molecular biomarkers including FLT3 mutational status. We found that the FLT3 mutation negative patients (n = 32) who responded to decitabine had significantly higher mitochondrial responses to the BIM and HRK mimetics (p = 0.04) compared with non-responders. We also found that FLT3 mutant patients (n = 12) had significantly (p = 0.02) higher priming than those patients lacking those lesions. Surprisingly, despite being apparently more predisposed towards apoptosis, these patients are less likely to respond to decitabine (42% versus 20%) in vivo than those without these mutations. This could indicate that additional non-mitochondrial inhibitory mechanisms are present in those FLT3 mutant leukemias that prevent response to decitabine.To further examine the interaction between FLT3 and mitochondrial priming, we profiled engineered cell lines with and without FLT3 mutations. We found that mitochondrial priming was significantly lower (p = 0.03) in BAF3 cells with unmutated FLT3 compared with five BAF3 cell lines containing FLT3 mutations (ITD and TKD mutations). Further, we examined the Broad Institute's Cancer Therapeutics Response database (CTRP v 2.0) for cancer cell line response to decitabine and found that wild type FLT3 cell lines that responded to decitabine had significantly higher mitochondrial priming than those that did not respond to the drug (p = 0.04), consistent with the patient data.Taken together, we have discovered that response to decitabine in AML cell lines and AML patient samples depends on mitochondrial dependencies and FLT3 mutational status. Genetic lesions in FLT3; however, may be able to over-ride mitochondrial responsiveness to pro-apoptotic factors, illustrating the probable need to measure multiple attribute types including genetics and ex vivo functional testing to accurately determine the likelihood of response to AML therapies.\"]",

        "Background":"['The death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) belongs to a family of multifunctional Ser/Thr-kinases that plays a crucial role in the mediation of cell death, autophagy and tumor suppression. Loss or reduced expression of DAPK1 occurs in the majority of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and many other non-hematological tumors commonly involving epigenetic silencing. To identify novel key DAPK1 transcriptional regulators, we conducted an siRNA screen in HEK293 cells using a custom library targeting over 60 individual genes with known or predicted DNA-binding function and general potential to modulate transcription. Candidate gene selection for siRNA-mediated knock-down was based on previous genome-wide siRNA screening experiments and in silico prediction of binding sites at the DAPK1 promoter region. As endogenous readout, DAPK1 mRNA expression was monitored by qRT-PCR.Using this strategy, we identified nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y) as the top positive regulator of DAPK1 that reduces its expression down to 55% of the level determined in untargeted control siRNA-treated cells. NF-Y is a well known transcriptional regulator of genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis and stress response. NF-Y consists of 3 subunits, NF-YA, -YB and -YC, forming a trimeric complex which is essential for specific binding of CCAAT boxes located proximal to the transcriptional start sites of genes. In addition to HEK293 cells, we were able to diminish DAPK1 mRNA expression upon siRNA-mediated NF-Y knockdown in a panel of 6 different cancer cell lines. Conversely, co-overexpression of NF-YA,-YB and -YC in HEK293 cells leads to increased expression levels of DAPK1. To investigate whether NF-Y contributes directly or indirectly to DAPK1 transcriptional regulation, DAPK1 luciferase reporter constructs harboring the predicted NF-Y binding site were generated. Point mutation of the reverse CCAAT-box in the DAPK1 promoter constructs significantly reduces the promoter activity down to 60% of the wild-type promoter. Furthermore, NF-Y knockdown significantly reduces the activity of the wild-type DAPK1 luciferase construct down to 55% in reporter assays. Strikingly, the CCAAT-box mutated constructs do not show altered activity after NF-Y depletion, suggesting a direct regulation of DAPK1 by NF-Y. Taken together, these results strongly indicate a direct role for NF-Y in the regulation of basal DAPK1 transcription levels, and also propose a novel mechanism for aberrant transcriptional silencing of DAPK1 in cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Previously, we described the antileukemic synergistic interactions between the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol (F) and TRAIL in multiple cell lines representing a broad spectrum of human leukemia. With the introduction of new hybrid regimens for flavopiridol-based therapies and advances in the clinical development of TRAIL/TRAIL agonists, a renewed interest in this therapeutic concept has emerged. In an attempt to identify key mechanistic signaling networks, human U937 leukemia cells were treated simultaneously with F (SelleckChem, Houston TX) and TRAIL (Alexis, Enzo, Farmingdale, NY) and analyzed for signaling events associated to cell death induction. We found a dramatic F-mediated shift from cytoprotective NF-kB, AKT and ERK pathways to pro-cell death ceramide and JNK signals. Functional studies using both pharmacological inhibitors and genetically modified cells revealed the functional relevance of these signals. Furthermore, F-mediated transcriptional modifications played key roles in determining and regulating the cross-talk between anti- and pro-cell death pathways. Co-exposure to F resulted in transcriptional down-regulation of genes involved in the regulation of pro-apoptotic JNK including XIAP, Gadd45 and phosphatases DUSP1, -10 and -11. In addition, F induced a significant reduction of multiple anti-apoptotic genes/proteins directly implicated in the pro-apoptotic cascades including (Mcl-1, XIAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, c-Flip, cIAP2/3), and cell cycle modulators (cyclin D1, -E1/E2, CDKs 1,7,9,13,17, p15, p57, p21). However, although in many cases similar changes were observed in F- and TRAIL/F-treated cells, additional factors may have to exist that lead to the potent synergistic interactions observed with the drug combination. In fact, by using clonogenic assays (long term effects), we observed that while TRAIL or F-treated cells were able to recover after treatment, that was not the case in TRAIL/F-exposed cells (% clonogenic survival', ' T= 82, F=47, TF= 1.4). Time-course analysis by flow cytometry of cell surface localized TRAIL Death Receptors DR4 and DR5 showed that in the presence of F, either alone or in combination with TRAIL, the membrane levels of both receptors were significantly increased during the first 2-6h of treatment. Together, these findings indicate that combined exposure of human acute leukemia cells to TRAIL/FP results in an early mobilization of TRAIL death receptors (DR4, DR5) to the cell surface, effect that is temporally associated with activation of anti-apoptotic ERK, AKT and NF-kB signals; however, activation of DR4/5-mediated apoptotic pathway is later potentiated by a shift toward pro-cell death JNK/ceramide signals that, in association to F-mediated transcriptional effects, results in a dramatic increase in the sensitivity to TRAIL in otherwise TRAIL-resistant human leukemia cells.']",

To study the impact of SF3B1 mutations on splicing, RNAseq data obtained from breast cancer, melanoma, CLL and MDS samples with mutant (SF3B1MUT) or wild-type SF3B1 (SF3B1WT) were compared. The majority of aberrant junctions identified in the samples with mutant SF3B1 utilized an alternative 3ss, suggesting its neomorphic function. Motif analysis of the sequences used by SF3B1MUT revealed the usage of a cryptic AG with a shorter and weaker polypyrimidine tract. Minigenes with modifications of these sites revealed the importance of both intronic and exonic sequence features for the recognition of the cryptic AG by SF3B1MUT. Of the aberrant junctions identified, several were common across all hotspot mutations and diseases; however, a unique aberrant splicing profile was found for each disease suggesting lineage and disease specific effects. The majority of splicing defects introduced a premature termination codon downstream of the cryptic AG leading to nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of aberrant transcripts and downregulation of gene expression, such as ABCB7. Gene-set enrichment analysis of aberrantly spliced and differentially expressed genes in SF3B1MUT MDS samples identified genes involved in cell differentiation and epigenetic pathways which are known to be deregulated in MDS. The impact on erythroid differentiation by SF3B1MUT was studied in transduced TF-1 cells following erythropoietin (EPO) stimulation. As expected, TF-1 SF3B1WT cells were able to differentiate normally after EPO treatment; however, expression of SF3B1K700E (the most common hotspot mutation found in RARS and CLL) induced a block in erythoid differentiation. This differentiation block was not observed with the expression of SF3B1G742D, a mutation found in CLL but not RARS, suggesting a context dependent role for SF3B1 mutations. Interestingly, the differentiation block observed in SF3B1K700E was associated with cytokine independent growth. Initial mining of RNAseq data from SF3B1MUT TF-1 cells highlighted several aberrantly spliced and NMD-downregulated genes previously implicated in MDS. Finally, a xenograft model was developed by subcutaneous implantation of transduced TF-1 cells. After several passages, an enrichment of TF-1 SF3B1K700E cells was observed, suggesting a growth advantage for SF3B1MUT cells over SF3B1WT cells. This data suggests that the K700E SF3B1 mutation can lead to a block in differentiation and competitive advantage as observed in human RARS.']",

        "Background":"[\"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are B-cell malignancies with initial high response rate to chemoimmunotherapy, but are largely considered incurable. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved to treat MCL, is under development for other B-cell malignancies. We developed a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for describing data collected to date in clinical trials with ibrutinib.Ibrutinib plasma data were available from 3 clinical trials\", ' 1) a phase 1 dose-escalation study in recurrent B-cell malignancies (doses', ' 1.25-12.5 mg/kg and 560 mg fixed); 2) a phase 1b/2 dose-finding study in CLL (doses', ' 420 and 840 mg); 3) an open-label, phase 2, fixed-dose study in MCL (dose', ' 560 mg). Overall, 3477 observations were collected in 245 patients following single and repeated daily dosing on different treatment days. A 2-compartment model with sequential zero to first order absorption and first order elimination was implemented. Analyses were performed with a log-transform-both-sides approach. Additive and exponential models were used to describe residual and inter-individual variability, respectively. The first-order conditional estimation method was implemented using NONMEM v 7.1.A linear model constructed with data collected following single and repeated doses of ibrutinib at different dose levels demonstrated that the PK was dose and time independent. Ibrutinib was rapidly absorbed and was characterized by a high oral plasma clearance (1000 L/h with between-subject variability of 21.9%; this, for a dose of 560 mg, would lead to an average steady state concentration of 22 ng/mL, ie, 50 nM) and a high apparent volume of distribution at steady state (10,000 L). Though both values are confounded by absolute bioavailability, these values suggest that ibrutinib clearance and volume are high. The half-lives of distribution and terminal phases were estimated to be <1 h and 14 h, respectively. Administration of ibrutinib in fasting state was characterized by a 67% relative bioavailability compared to both meal conditions used in the clinical trials and administration after a high-fat meal. The PK parameters were not found to be significantly different between studies and clinical indications. Body weight and coadministration of antacids had a marginal effect on volume of distribution and duration of absorption processes, respectively. No significant effect of covariates such as age, gender, patient pretreatment, or clinical chemistry data was found. Population parameters and inter-individual variability were estimated with good precision. The model provided satisfactory goodness of fit, individual fittings, and visual predictive checks.In conclusion, the proposed population PK model was able to accommodate the plasma concentration-time profiles of ibrutinib across various trials.']",

AML Cytogenetic classification currently guides AML treatment selection strategies based on risk-adapted treatment. However, AML has proven to be a heterogeneous disease and in up to 45% of patients, cytogenetic classification fails to predict their clinical outcome and thus fails to guide further therapy. micro-RNA (miRNA) are regulators of hematopoiesis and their expression is related to gene expression modulations. miRNAs can be detected in the blood stream. Thus we intend to evaluate the value of miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers in AML.Methods', ' Using a retrospective case-control (age-gender match) study design, plasma miRMA was isolated from 10 samples (5 control cases and 5 AML cases). miRNA was isolated from plasma sample using miRNeasy kit.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' The use of adoptive transfer of T cells for the treatment of cancer has been hampered by the low persistence of the infused cells and the difficulty to isolate and expand tumor-specific lymphocytes. The use of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) allows the circumvention of these problems. CARs consist of an antibody-derived scFv, a transmembrane region and an intracellular activating signaling domain, recognizing the target antigen with high affinity and in a MHC-independent fashion. Nonetheless, off-target responses owing to the recognition of the target antigen in healthy cells limit the application of this therapy. The antigen CD19 represents a good target for the elimination of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) and anti-CD19 CAR+ lymphocytes are being used clinically. However, the expression of CD19 as a pan B-lineage marker leads to mature B cell depletion. Objective', ' Since mature B cells express both CD19 and CD20 antigens, we propose the creation of an inhibitory CAR directed to CD20, allowing the lymphocytes to discriminate between BCP-ALL and mature B cells. Methods', ' Jurkat cells expressing the plasmid pGL4.30 (luciferase controlled by a NFAT responsive element) were generated and used as a reporter cell line. As target cells we used the K562 cell line modified to express CD19 (K5-19), CD20 (K5-20) or CD19 and CD20 (K5-19/20). The expression of the activation marker CD69 was evaluated by flow cytometry. The Sleeping Beauty transposon system was used to modify primary human T lymphocytes and the effector activity was evaluated by cytotoxicity and IFNg production assays. Results', ' Three different inhibitory CD20-CARs containing signaling domains CTLA-4, PD-1 or BTLA were constructed. Jurkat cells expressing the CD19- activating CAR 19BBz showed high activity of luciferase when cultured with K5-19 or K5-19/20. However, Jurkat cells expressing both the activating and inhibitory CARs showed a potent inhibition of luciferase activity when incubated with K5-19/20, while maintaining a high activity when cultured with K5-19 cells. Moreover, the three inhibitory CARs were able to inhibit the de novo expression of CD69 induced by 19BBz in Jurkat cells. In primary T cells, the CAR 20PD1 was not able to inhibit the production of IFNg or the cytotoxic activity induced by 19BBz. Surprisingly, T cells expressing both 19BBz and 20PD1 showed preferential lysis of CD19+ CD20+ targets, suggesting that addition of PD1 signaling domain might augment T cell function in particular contexts. Conclusions', ' The results in Jurkat cells suggest that CD20-CARs can inhibit the activation of lymphocytes mediated by CD19-CAR. However, additional experiments are required to evaluate the inhibitory activity of 20PD1 in primary human T cells. Experiments with CARs 20CTLA4 and 20BTLA are in progress and might allow the validation of the dual CAR hypothesis in vitro and in vivo.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Functional disparity among BCL-2 members in tonsillar and leukemic B cell subsets probed by next generation BH3 mimetic profiling",
        "Background":"['Introduction and aim. Long-lived humoral immunity, in the form of plasma cells (PC) and memory B cells, as well as most B cell malignancies, originate in the germinal center (GC). For successful therapies against malignant B cells it is crucial to understand their survival requirements in relation to their normal counterparts. It was previously shown that murine GC B cells depend on pro-survival protein MCL-1, but not BCL-XL, although both are expressed. In contrast, nave and memory B cells express BCL-2, and as a consequence, they are sensitive to the BH3 mimetic ABT-737, which blocks both BCL-2 and BCL-XL but not MCL-1. The divergent roles of MCL-1 and BCL-XL in GC B cells still remain unexplained, and it is unknown if this also holds for human B cells. We here dissect these aspects in human tonsillar B subsets and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, a B cell cancer where expression of BCL-2 members is influenced by signals that also occur in the normal GC.Experimental procedures. We used FACS sorting of tonsil B subsets, mRNA and protein profiling, co-culture of CLL cells, co-IP of BCL-2 members, cell death assays with next generation BH3 mimetics specific for BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1 (ABT-199, WEHI-539, A-1210477).Results. Naive and memory B cells are mainly sensitive to specific inhibition of BCL-2 by ABT-199. In contrast, GC B cells and tonsil PC are insensitive to ABT-199, but undergo apoptosis when MCL-1 is inhibited. Tonsil PC display yet another profile and are remarkably sensitive to inhibition of BCL-XL. MCL-1 expression in GC B cells is regulated post-translationally and its physiological importance is highlighted by exclusive binding to pro-apoptotic BIM. In contrast, BCL-XL is transcriptionally induced in the GC-light zone, and is solely bound to the weak BH3-only sensitizer BIK, which may explain why BCL-XL is not required for GC B cell survival.These approaches were extended to primary CLL cells either resting or stimulated via CD40, as model for circulating and lymph node resident cells. We showed recently that CD40 stimulation strongly induces MCL-1, BCL-XL and BFL-1, similar to the pattern in healthy GC B cells, and confers complete resistance to ABT-199, whereas untreated CLL cells are highly sensitive. We now demonstrate that dual or triple BH3 mimetic combinations are effective in killing CD40-stimulated CLL. In contrast to GC B cells, BIK is absent in CLL cells while NOXA is highly expressed and, like BIM, is bound to MCL-1. This may account for differential sensitivity to (combinations of) BH3 mimetics.Conclusion. Using novel BH3 mimetics and interaction profiles, we were able to probe the contribution of individual BCL-2 members in survival of normal and malignant B cells. Our findings provide clues to determine therapeutic windows in novel treatment strategies in B cell and other malignancies.']",

In this retrospective study, we aim at identifying the number of cardiac toxicity cases among patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) who were treated with targeted therapies over 10-year period with emphasis on natural history and outcomes.METHODS', ' With the help of the Faculty Practice Decision Support (FPDS) team, we used 114 diagnosis codes for HM and 17 codes for cardiac diseases in order to mine our electronic medical records (EPIC) and identify patients with HM and specific cardiac problems, then sorted them according to whether they received known biologic agents such as thymidine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, hypomethylating agents, and immunomodulatory drugs.RESULTS', ' FPDS team provided us with a file that contained medical records of 820 patients that had both HM and cardiac abnormalities. We pulled out 53 patients who received the drugs of interest. We were able to confirm cardiac toxicity defined mainly by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of < 50%, arrhythmias, or ischemic cardiovascular event in 44 patients. Ten patients were excluded because of pre-existing cardiac disease. Thus the final analysis was performed on the remaining 34 patients. The median follow-up was 9 mo (range, 1-78). The median age of this group was 66 years (range, 27-81), male/female 19/15, 26 Caucasians, and 15 were still alive. The median time from exposure to development of cardiac events was 120 days (range, <1-300). The diagnosis distribution was as follows', \" multiple myeloma 16, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 10, follicular NHL 4, Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia 3, MDS 1. Number of patients (n) who received suspected drugs contributing to the cardiac toxicity\", ' bortezomib (8), carfilzomib (4), imatinib (2), dasatinib (4), Rituximab (13), and lenalidomide (3). Twenty one patients had no prior cardiac disease, while 11 had known coronary artery disease and 2 had known arrhythmias, while only 9 had no chronic co-morbidities. Fourteen patients did not receive anthracyclines including 2 who received rituximab. Nine patients had elevation in troponin and were diagnosed with NSTE myocardial infarction at the time of cardiac toxicity. Among the 19 dead patients, only 6 died of cardiac causes, while the rest died of their cancers. Repeat echocardiograms showed worsening of LVEF in 5 patients and improvement in 15 patients.CONCLUSIONS', ' About 4.1% of patients with HM experience unanticipated cardiac toxicity with related mortality of 17.6%. Most patients do well with stable compensated cardiac function with objective improvement in LVEF. Whether Rituximab can cause cardiac toxicity is controversial and we will present specific arguments.']",

        "Background":"['The undesirable outcomes of classical chemotherapy approaches in the treatment of cancer pathogenesis has directed scientists to find more targeted and less toxic therapies. Numerous studies of targeted therapies in cancer have demonstrated that finding target genes that are responsible for cancer pathogenesis can lead to novel targeted cancer therapies. Among these studies, tyrosine kinases have been prominent as effective gene targets. We have employed this approach to study the hematologic malignancy, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).In this study, we aimed to understand how human tyrosine kinase members, as functional drivers of leukemogenesis, promote tumor progression by activating downstream molecules. For this purpose, an RNAi assisted silencing assay was designed in which every individual tyrosine kinase member was silenced and impact on primary AML cell viability was assessed. Bioinformatic interpretation of the data revealed that TYRO3 is one of the genes showing significant sensitivity to silencing in 7.64% of AML cases tested (n = 484). This data is compatible with previous studies showing aberrant expression of TAM family member tyrosine kinases in several human cancers. In addition, immunoblotting was performed to assess TYRO3 protein expression in several AML cell lines. Several AML lines demonstrated higher expression levels of TYRO3. In a strong correlation with this finding, TYRO3 siRNA was able to partially silence the TYRO3 expression especially in those cell lines that have higher expression levels of TYRO3 and due to this silencing we observed decreased cell viability relative to non-specific siRNA suggesting that high expression of TYRO3 provides a cell survival advantage in AML.Even though signaling pathways of other TAM family members and their interactions are described in detail, TYRO3 downstream signaling pathway still remains quite undetermined which makes it an intriguing player in cell survival. There are not many small molecules designed to inhibit TAM tyrosine kinases, but our study shows that successful targeted inhibition of this family of receptor tyrosine kinases may represent a promising avenue to provide opportunities to improve therapeutic approaches for patients with AML.[1] Druker, Brian J.

Patients were 18 or older at AML/AP diagnosis. Outcomes were described by Kaplan and Meier and the Log rank test. Results', ' We identified 30 patients, with transformed MPN into AML (n = 23) or AP (n = 7), including one patient in AP at presentation. Most were male (73%). Disease evolved from polycythemia vera (n = 6), essential thrombocythemia (n = 11), primary myelofibrosis (n = 9) and other MPN diagnoses (MPN/MDS overlap, n = 3; MPN NOS, n = 1). The median age at MPN diagnosis was 67.5 yrs, and at transformation 72 yrs. The median time from MPN diagnosis to transformation was 5.6 yrs (range 0.3-36.0). 12 patients had JAK2 V617F testing both at MPN diagnosis and AML diagnosis; 6 had JAK2 mutations at both time points and 2 lost JAK2 at transformation. At AML/AP transformation, 11 patients had NGS mutation testing; the most common somatic mutations were NRAS (5/11), RUNX1 (2/11), and SRSF2 (2/11). 20 patients received treatment outside of supportive care. Of these, 8 achieved a CR or CRi (40%; 7/10 with induction and 1/8 with HMA). The only HMA response was on a trial of HMA+SGN33a. The median survival from AML/AP transformation was 5.8 mo. Of treated patients, median survival was 7.4 mo; 37% of treated patients were alive at 1 yr. Nine patients (31%; 7 with AML and 2 with AP) underwent allogeneic transplantation; 2 relapsed during follow-up. 74% of patients treated with allo-HCT were alive at 1 yr after AML/AP transformation. Conclusions', ' AML or accelerated phase disease arising out of MPN carries a dismal prognosis. HMA monotherapy had little efficacy in this group (0/7 achieved remission). Allogeneic transplantation offered the best chance of survival at one year, but fewer than a third of patients were able to proceed to transplant.']",

Methods', '  Two U.S. administrative claims databases were combined (01/2000-06/2012) to identify adult CML pts initiated on TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib). Pts were followed for 12 months from their first TKI prescription and categorized into 3 cohorts based on frequency of qPCR tests (i.e., 0, 1-2, and 3-4).

Combination Index (CI) values were calculated by the method of Chou and Talalay. Apoptosis was measured using Annexin V/7AAD and flow cytometry. Western blots examining H2AX as well as comet assays were used to measure DNA damage induction. Inhibitory phosphorylation of BRCA2, a critical protein in the homologous recombination pathway, was examined by Western blot. Finally, wild type Bl6 mice were injected with a murine AML cell line (Mll-Enl+FLT3-ITD+) and treated daily with olaparib and/or AZD1775. Leukemia progression was determined by measuring luciferase activity biweekly via In Vivo Imaging Systems (IVIS).Results', ' Combined inhibition of Wee1 and Parp1/2 was synergistic, as measured by cell numbers at 72 hours, in all 4 cell lines tested, with CI values ranging from 0.3 to 0.9. When cells were allowed to recover after treatment, those treated by single agents were able to continue proliferating. However, those treated with the combination did not recover as well or at all, indicating greatly impaired proliferative capacity. Combined inhibition of Wee1 and Parp1/2 also resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis greater than either drug alone. Comet assays and western blots for H2AX confirmed that the combination of Wee1 and Parp1/2 resulted in more DNA damage than either drug alone. Western blots demonstrated increased inhibitory phosphorylation of BRCA2 in cells treated with AZD1775 suggesting impaired homologous recombination upon Wee1 inhibition. In preliminary in vivo studies, mice with AML treated with olaparib and AZD1775 displayed prolonged survival compared to mice treated with single agents.Conclusion', ' Combined inhibition of Wee1 and Parp1/2 results in greater inhibition of AML, T-ALL, and B-ALL cell proliferation, DNA damage and apoptosis than either drug alone. Inhibition of Wee1 resulted in increased BRCA2 inhibitory phosphorylation, suggesting that this increased sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition could be due to impairment of the homologous recombination pathway. Preliminary studies indicate that combined inhibition of Wee1 and Parp1/2 enhances survival in a murine AML model. These preliminary studies raise the possibility of rational combinations of targeted agents for leukemia in patients for whom conventional chemotherapeutics may not be well tolerated.']",

        "Background":"['The catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Transcriptional factors and epigenetic modifications regulate this expression. Studies suggest hypermethylation promotes hTERT overexpression. Imetelstat is a competitive telomerase inhibitor. Decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA) are DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs) used in the treatment of AML. Combining imetelstat and DNMTI may be an improved treatment option for AML. We investigated effects of DAC and AZA on hTERT expression and cell viability in AML cell lines OCI-AML3 and OCI-AML5, and evaluated growth inhibition when combined with imetelstat. OCI-AML3 had higher baseline expression of hTERT compared with OCI-AML5. Dose-dependent downregulation of hTERT expression was observed with DAC and AZA treatments. OCI-AML5 was more sensitive to DAC (1 M, 46% viability) than OCI-AML3 (1 M, 95% viability) whereas sensitivity to AZA was similar in both cell lines (1 M, 29% vs 33% viability). After removal of the drugs, growth inhibition was not sustained and cell proliferation rebounded. Single-agent imetelstat reduced both hTERT expression and telomerase activity but resulted in only limited growth inhibition in these cell lines. It was hypothesized that combining DNMTI with imetelstat may exert more potent growth inhibition. To test this, both cell lines were treated with DAC or AZA for 72 hours followed by different concentrations of imetelstat for 2 to 4 weeks. Dose-dependent synergistic activity was demonstrated for DAC followed by imetelstat', ' OCI-AML3 cell viability changed from 95% with DAC to 61% and 10% after 2 and 4 weeks of imetelstat, respectively; OCI-AML5 cell viability changed from 46% with DAC to 6% and 1% after 2 and 4 weeks of imetelstat, respectively. In contrast, no enhanced activity was observed in either cell line with AZA followed by imetelstat, but imetelstat was able to slow the growth rebound after AZA removal. Additional studies are ongoing to further understand the mechanism of action of this drug combination in AML and to evaluate different combination sequences of DNMTI with imetelstat for optimal anticancer activity. In summary, DAC and AZA reduced hTERT expression and differentially inhibited cell viability in AML cell lines. Although at the same concentration AZA was more active than DAC in OCI-AML3 and OCI-AML5 lines, the sustainability of growth inhibition after washout differed. Growth rebounded after removal of AZA or DAC treatment. Dose-dependent synergistic activity demonstrated by DAC followed by imetelstat was not seen with AZA followed by imetelstat. Distinctly different mechanisms of action of DAC and AZA may underlie their differential activity when combined with imetelstat, warranting further investigation.']",

        "Background":"['Internal tandem duplication mutations of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) are found in 30% of Acute Myeloid Leukemias and are associated with a very poor outcome. Although the activity of FLT3 inhibitors such as AC-220 is currently evaluated in phase II and III trials with promising results, some studies suggest that leukemic cells can develop various mechanisms of resistance including mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD).In the present work, we show that AML cell lines harboring FLT3-ITD mutation, MV4-11 and MOLM-14, are exquisitely sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Importantly, although bortezomib induced apoptosis in all primary AML samples (n=24), FLT3-ITD mutated cells (n=13) are much more sensitive than non-mutated samples (n=11). Moreover we observed a positive correlation between FLT3-ITD mutation load (measured by the FLT3-ITD/FLT3wt ratio) and bortezomib activity among FLT3-ITD samples (p=0.0084, r=0.719). At the molecular level, bortezomib induced autophagy, as shown by an increase of LC3-II protein expression and by electron microscopy analysis. This autophagy was mainly cytotoxic as cell death was inhibited by the autophagy pharmacological inhibitor, 3-methyladenine. Before cell death occurs, we observed that bortezomib induced a downregulation of FLT3-ITD both in cell lines and primary samples. Accordingly, cell signalling dependent on FLT3-ITD (ERK/Akt/STAT5) was inhibited upon bortezomib treatment. Others proteasome inhibitors such as MG-132 or carfilzomib were also able to downregulate FLT3-ITD protein level. Interestingly, 3-methyladenine restored FLT3-ITD expression and signaling after bortezomib exposure, suggesting a role for autophagy in the downregulation of the mutated receptor. Using confocal microscopy, we showed a co-localization between FLT3-ITD and LC3 structures after bortezomib exposure. Electron microscopy analyses confirmed the presence of the receptor in autophagy vesicles. Furthermore, the membrane trafficking inhibitor dynasore inhibited autophagy, cell death and degradation of FLT3-ITD induced by bortezomib. We also showed that bortezomib overcomes the resistance to AC-220 in a MOLM-14 ITD/TKD model, by triggering the degradation of the receptor. Finally, in vivo studies using a mouse xenograft model, confirmed that bortezomib was able to decrease FLT3-ITD protein level and inhibit leukemic cell growth.Altogether, our results show that proteasome inhibitors induce a downregulation of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase FLT3-ITD in an autophagic-dependent manner, suggesting that they could be used as an alternative strategy in AML with FLT3-ITD mutations.']",

The primary endpoint was 12-mo rate of confirmed CCyR (cCCyR; CCyR on 2 consecutive analyses; any # of metaphases). Other endpoints were rates of and times to CCyR and major molecular response (MMR). Results', ' Pts characteristics were well balanced. Minimum follow-up was 12 mos; median treatment duration was 14 mos. 85% of dasatinib and 81% of IM pts remained on study. Median dose intensity was 99 mg/d for dasatinib and 400 mg/d for IM. cCCyR rate was superior for dasatinib vs IM (77% vs 66%, P = 0.0067). 12-mo CCyR and MMR rates (Table) were higher for dasatinib vs IM (CCyR', ' 83% vs 72%; MMR', ' 46% vs. 28%). MMR was obtained significantly faster with dasatinib (HR 2.0, P < 0.0001) as was CCyR (HR 1.5, P < 0.0001). Rates of transformation to AP/BC were 1.9% for dasatinib and 3.5% for IM. Grade 3/4 anemia (10% vs 7%) and neutropenia (21% vs 20%) were similar across arms; thrombocytopenia was more common for dasatinib (19% vs. 10%). Non-hematologic adverse drug reactions (all grades) in 10% of pts (dasatinib vs. IM) were fluid retention (19% vs 42%; including pleural effusion, all grade 1 or 2, 10% vs. 0%), nausea (8% vs. 20%), vomiting (5% vs. 10%), myalgia (6% vs.12%), muscle inflammation (4% vs. 17%) and rash (11% vs. 17%). Conclusions', ' Dasatinib showed significantly higher and faster rates of CCyR and MMR vs IM.

        "Background":"['The receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 is predominantly expressed in the endothelium but has also been identified on primitive hematopoietic stem cells, monocyte and macrophage subclasses, as well as on glioma or hematological tumor cells. Based on its expression in many patient-derived leukemic blasts inhibition of the Tie2 pathway may provide an attractive opportunity for therapeutic intervention in leukemias.In this study we report the pharmacological profile of a novel, highly potent and orally available Tie2 inhibitor (BAY-Tie2). The discovery and design process leading to BAY-Tie2 was performed with the goal of sparing other angiogenic RTKs, such as VEGFRs, FGFRs or PDGFRs. BAY-Tie2 is based on a novel imidazopyrazole core, combined with a SF5-substituted phenyl ring that fills the deep DFG-out pocket. BAY-Tie2 binds to Tie2 with a Kd value of 1.6 nM and is selective against VEGFR2 (Kd of 1600 nM), FGFR1 (<30% inhibition at 1 M), FGFR2/3/4 (<10% inhibition at 1 M) and PDGFR/ (<30% inhibition at 100 nM). BAY-Tie2 potently inhibits Tie2 autophosphorylation in recombinant CHO-Tie2 and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with IC50 values of 0.7 and 1.3 nM. Consistently, BAY-Tie2 was shown to inhibit Tie2 phosphorylation in vivo by analyzing angiopoietin-1 induced Tie2 phosphorylation status in extracts of murine lungs from BAY-Tie2-treated mice.In subcutaneous xenograft models of highly angiogenic tumors, BAY-Tie2 reduced tumor growth and showed evidence for potential combination benefit with anti-VEGF therapy. In order to explore the potential of a Tie2 inhibitor beyond affecting angiogenesis, we established disseminated leukemia models, using Tie2-expressing cell lines, such as the CML cell lines MEG-01 and EM-2. Both cell lines engrafted predominantly in bone marrow and spleen. Treatment started 3 days after i.v. cell implantation with either BAY-Tie2 or cytarabine and was well tolerated. Efficacy was monitored by a) inhibition of disease progression, b) weekly fluorescence-based in vivo imaging (IVI) using an Alexa750-labeled anti-human CD33 antibody, and c) q-RT-PCR specific for BCR-ABL and hCD45 in murine peripheral blood. BAY-Tie2 inhibited disease progression comparable to cytarabine. Tumor load measured by IVI was reduced in BAY-Tie2 treated groups by 45% in the MEG-01 and by 65% in the EM-2 model compared with the untreated control, very similar to the cytotoxic treatment with cytarabine. Quantitative RT-PCR on peripheral blood revealed that BAY-Tie2 and cytarabine delayed the appearance of circulating tumor cells in both CML models.These data demonstrate that BAY-Tie2 is an orally active Tie2 inhibitor that may have therapeutic benefit not only in angiogenic tumors but also in hematological, Tie2-expressing malignancies.']",

        "Meeting_name":" ERK5 inhibition potentiates the effects of leukemia cell differentiation inducers by augmenting the function of master transcription factors",
        "Background":"['ERK5, a member of MAPK family, is activated by multiple AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) cell differentiation inducers including 1,25D (1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and ATRA (All-trans retinoic acid). Inhibiting ERK5 with XMD8-92 which targets its auto phosphorylation, or BIX02188 which inhibits MEK5, a kinase that activates ERK5, leads to more advanced cell maturation compared to these inducers alone. Specifically, cells treated with 1,25D and TPA combined with MEK5/ERK5 inhibitors exhibit a macrophage-like phenotype, whereas, ATRA with MEK5/ERK5 inhibitors cause the cells to differentiate further in the granulocytic direction. An increased expression of the general myeloid marker CD11b was observed following treatments with all three inducers when MEK5/ERK5 were inhibited. In this study, we compared the underlying mechanisms of the potentiation effects of MEK5/ERK5 inhibition by these inducers. PU1 is considered to be a master transcription factor (TF) directing the cells to the myeloid lineage, and sustained PU1 expression over C/EBP results in monocytic differentiation. The role of C/EBP is controversial', ' it is generally believed to be a TF favoring granulocyte differentiation, however, in some studies, overexpression of C/EBP, together with activated estrogen receptor, can lead to the expression of macrophage-related genes. Thus, we measured the expression of these two TFs in HL60 and U937 cells treated with differentiation inducers alone or together with MEK/ERK5 inhibitors. 1,25D alone was able to increase PU1 protein expression in both cell lines; when combined with BIX02188 or XMD8-92, PU.1 expression further increased. Interestingly, increased C/EBP expression was also observed with XMD8-92 + 1,25D. TPA induced similar changes in PU.1 expression, as well as decreased C/EBP protein levels in the presence of the inhibitors, which was not seen with 1,25D and the inhibitors. Although ATRA alone or with BIX02188 increased PU1 expression, ATRA with XMD8-92 completely abolished PU1 expression which resulted in dramatically increased C/EBP over PU1 ratio. From the above data, we conclude that 1) ERK5 activation acts as a brake preventing the cells from further differentiation by all inducers studied here 2) Terminal differentiation which results from the addition of ERK5 inhibitors can be due to the combined effects of two master transcription factors. 3) The same TF can function differently in different settings.

        "Background":"['LSTRA leukemia was originally induced in a BALB/c mouse by the Moloney murine leukemia virus. The established LSTRA leukemic T cell line is transplantable in BALB/c mice and serves as an important animal model for leukemogenesis. Numerous studies using LSTRA cells have been reported in the field of cancer therapy, including immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Subsequent identification of a lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase gene Lck in LSTRA cells further highlights the LSTRA leukemia as a key model in studying hematologic malignancy induced by oncogenic Lck protein tyrosine kinase. While intraperitoneal inoculation of LSTRA cells reproducibly induces leukemic death in syngeneic BALB/c mice, very little is known on the details of its malignant progression. It also is not clear if LSTRA leukemia in mice resembles any specific T cell leukemia in humans. To better understand the process of LSTRA leukemia, we engineered LSTRA cells to stably express green fluorescence protein (GFP) by retroviral transduction. GFP-labeled LSTRA cells are easily distinguishable by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunoblotting. Biochemical characterization confirms that, like the parental LSTRA leukemia, GFP-tagged LSTRA cells express high levels of active Lck kinase. Consistent with our previous report (J Immunol 159', '5206), GFP-tagged LSTRA cells also exhibit constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT5. BALB/c mice receiving 10 million GFP-labeled LSTRA cells intraperitoneally show signs of leukemia, such as acute weight loss, abdominal swelling, hunched posture, and squinting eyes, within 1 week. All mice die within 10 days. Even intraperitoneal inoculation of 50 GFP-labeled LSTRA cells results in 40% lethality within a month. By tracking GFP, we were able to identify multi-organ metastasis of LSTRA leukemia, including bone marrow, spleen, and liver. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue sections further revealed a unique concentration of LSTRA cells in the red pulp of spleen. It is important to note that mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltration of the spleen red pulp has been reported in patients with T cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. It suggests that LSTRA leukemia may represent a murine model of distinct human T cell maliganacy, such as LGL leukemia. All together, we have shown here that the GFP-labeled LSTRA cell line is a powerful tool to monitor leukemic progression in immune-competent mice. It has important implications in utilizing LSTRA leukemia for future studies in cancer therapy. Experiments are also in progress to define the molecular mechanisms underlying LSTRA infiltration in the spleen red pulp.']",

The initial breakthrough of the targeted design concept was established by the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia with Abl inhibitors and has been expanded to other cancer indications. As a consequence of this early success in CML, the identification and targeting of genetic lesions that confer cancer dependence has become an established strategy for drug discovery efforts. However, this approach has met with mixed degrees of success as confounding factors, such as tumor heterogeneity, have often resulted in partial responses and/or the emergence of resistance when targeted therapies were employed as single agents.To improve the therapeutic benefit in cancer, rationally-devised novel combinations of two or more agents are being explored clinically. To discover combinations that may be more effective therapies, an unbiased, systematic approach was used to identify drug combinations in vitro, using a panel of genetically diverse, and well characterized cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE', \" Barretina et al. Nature 2012). For three cancer indications, all pairwise combinations of 18 selected drugs (both novel inhibitors and standards of care) were tested as dose matrices in a proliferation assay. Synergistic interactions were scored using isobologram/Loewe's excess inhibition and synergistic concentration ranges for each agent were identified. However, the clinical translation of positive combinations from in vitro matrix-based screens into clinically-relevant doses and schedules are challenging, due to host biology, tumor-stroma interactions, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of drug delivery. To explore this higher complexity, we evaluated the in vitro to in vivo translation of drug synergies in immune-compromised mouse tumor xenograft models. To recapitulate the pharmacological combination effects in vivo, mouse pharmacokinetic data and simulation was used to determine single agent doses that would result in the desired compound plasma concentration range and duration of action. Pharmakokinetics, pharmacodynamics, antitumor activity and tolerability of the combinations were then tested in tumor-bearing mice.

Frequent mutations on BRAF gene have been detected in various types of human cancer, including malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, ovarian cancer and hairy cell leukemia. Among all, a single point 1799T>A (V600E) transversion, the most common mutation on BRAF, results in increased kinase activity. It serves as a driver mutation in several types of cancer and confers increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, detecting the BRAF V600E mutation may offer valuable information for cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Here we report a rapid, highly sensitive method for the detection of BRAF V600 mutation using a bridged nucleic acid (BNA) clamp technology associated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Due to the feature of enhanced affinity for hybridization template, BNA clamp is able to selectively block PCR reactions on the perfect match DNA sequence, while leaves the mismatch template unaffected. In this study several BNA clamps that bind to BRAF V600 wild-type (WT) template was designed, synthesized, and characterized. As compared to DNA clamp counterparts, these BNA clamps increased Tm values for the BRAF V600 WT by greater than 30C. In addition, BNA clamps efficiently distinguished BRAF WT (perfect match) from V600E (mismatch) templates (deltaTm >12C). In qPCR assays BNA clamps could suppress amplification of WT by >1,000-fold, while had little or no effects on the V600E mutant. Such BNA clamps allowed us to detect 1.0% or lower levels for the BRAF V600E mutant in a wild-type background.

Transient expression has several advantages', ' short-term expression may allow initial clinical testing while limiting toxicity, and expediting manufacturing and scaling to GMP of CAR modifications, allowing rapid iterative improvements of CAR design. To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of mRNA CAR+T cells, we used xenograft models of human ALL (Nalm-6 and a primary patient leukemia, both CD19+) and high-level human T cell engraftment. NSG mice were injected with ALL at a dose producing 100% BM engraftment by 5d with 100% mortality by 25d (Nalm-6) or 36d (Primary). T cells were expanded ex vivo using CD3/CD28 beads and underwent lentiviral gene transfer or mRNA electroporation. mRNA transfection produced high but transient CAR surface expression, peaking at 4 hours and then declining over 8d. Using a novel method of simultaneous bioluminescent tracking of CARs and leukemia, we observed rapid migration of CAR T cells to all sites of disease and 100-fold reduction in ALL burden after only 24h. Using low dose cyclophosphamide (CTX; 60 mg/kg IP) 24h before the next infusion, we were able to deplete non-CAR expressing T cells and observe continued effects on leukemia from subsequent mRNA CAR infusions resulting in significantly prolonged survival in mice treated with mRNA CARs. Short-term efficacy of a single dose of mRNA vs. lentiviral CAR+ T cells was similar. Neither CTX nor untargeted repeat CAR T cells infusions alone had an effect on leukemia burden or survival. While lentiviral CAR+ T cells persisted and were active longer, median overall survival was not different between repeat mRNA CARs (52d Nalm-6, 76d primary) and a single dose of lentiviral transduced CARs (54d Nalm-6, 87d primary). Only stably expressed CARs resulted in any long term cures in this model. Relapse patterns suggest that the efficacy of mRNA and lentivirus CAR T cells are similar, as peripheral disease can be repeatedly cleared with subsequent mRNA CAR infusions but immune privileged xenograft artifact sites such as the tooth root are more resistant. These pre-clinical results demonstrate an important advance in T cell engineering, and are leading directly to clinical trials testing mRNA CAR CTLs.']",

        "Background":"['AML is a heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled clonal expansion of leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Current therapies for AML are not curative, in part due to their inability to eradicate LSCs from the bone marrow. T cell redirection has been shown to be effective in heme malignancies and represents a promising approach to treat AML by targeting markers differentially expressed on the cell surface of cancer cells. One marker, CD123 (-chain of the interleukin-3 receptor) is often present on AML LSCs and blasts. We developed a human bispecific antibody (CD123xCD3; Ab-178) capable of binding to the extracellular domain of CD123 and the  chain of CD3 on T cells to induce T cellmediated tumor cell killing. This bispecific IgG4 antibody can recruit T cells to CD123+ AML cells (MOLM-13, KG-1 and OCI-AML5) and induce T cell activation as evidenced by CD69 and CD25 up-regulation on T cells. Ab-178 potently killed these CD123+ AML cell lines in vitro (EC50 = 0.51-0.91 nM) but not a CD123 cell line (JIM3). Ab-178 was also able to induce tumor inhibition (MOLM-13 cells) and regression (KG-1 cells) in murine xenograft CD123+ AML models in the presence of human PBMCs. Furthermore, this antibody was able to kill AML blasts in primary AML blood samples ex vivo in the absence of exogenous T cells (autologous setting; EC50 = 0.83 nM). Related bispecific antibodies directed against a viral epitope (nullxCD3 or CD123xnull) did not activate T cells or cause tumor cell killing in the various assays tested. Ab-178 had no impact on T cell activation when incubated with T cells alone. These results indicate that Ab-178 can potently and specifically activate T cells in the presence of CD123+ AML cells and induce their killing. Furthermore, because of the antibody format, this molecule is expected to have a longer half-life compared to smaller bispecific biologic scaffolds. Ab-178 is currently being evaluated pre-clinically for its potential to treat patients with AML.']",

Purine analog therapy is highly effective with complete remission rates of approximately 85% in first line. HCL variant (HCLv) is recognized as a distinct entity, lacking CD25 and usually lacking annexin A1, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase expression, CD123, and also lacks the BRAF V600E mutation. Patients respond poorly to purine analogs, with partial response in less than 50% and relatively poor overall survival from diagnosis. HCLc expressing B-cell receptor (BCR) with the IGHV4-34 immunoglobulin rearrangement has a poor prognosis like HCLv, whether immunophenotypically consistent with HCLv or HCLc, and also lacks BRAF V600E. We previously reported a series of 17 patients expressing IGHV4-34, immunophenotypically resembling HCLc in 7 and HCLv in 10 cases. Using routine deep sequencing of patient samples for immunoglobulin rearrangements, we have been able to accumulate 42 IGHV4-34 expressing cases including 23 classic HCL and 19 HCLv. Six (26%) of 23 HCLc vs 12 (63%) of 19 HCLv were truly unmutated, with VH gene germline identity (GI) 100%. Eleven (48%) of 23 HCLc and 7 (37%) of 19 HCLv were borderline-mutated (97≤GI<100), and 6 (26%) of 23 HCLc were significantly mutated (97<GI). There was no significant difference between the 5 groups with respect to either IGHD or IGHJ genes usage, or CDR3 length. However, we found a significant restriction of IGHD genes between 12 HCLv truly unmutated and 6 HCLc truly unmutated cases, in that there was no overlap of any IGHD genes between these 2 groups (p<0.0001). Of 28 cases test for BRAF V600E, only 5 were positive, all HCLc with GI 93.18-97.49%.

Of the 23 BRAF WT cases, 9 patients died of disease, 9 have active disease, and only 2 are in remission. Patients commonly had highly aggressive courses, with infiltration of HCLc/HCLv into spinal cord and cranial nerves, cardiac muscle, lungs, and cervical lymph nodes. Complete remission was achieved only through either recombinant immunotoxin therapy of combination purine analog and rituximab, but not by purine analogs alone.

To address these questions, we performed RNA-seq, DNA methylation analysis and ChIP-seq (H3K4me2, H3K9me2, and H3K27me3) to study the effects of inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DAC), histone deacetylases (Depsi), histone demethylases (KDM1A inhibitor S2101), and histone methylases (EHMT2 inhibitor UNC0638 and EZH2 inhibitor GSK343) in three different cancer models (colon cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia). In colon cancer cells (YB5), DAC affected 3% of the transcriptome and 93% of the effect was gene upregulation. DAC had a greater effect on genes expressed in normal tissues and silenced in cancer (443 genes) compared to genes that do not change in cancer (194 genes). 90% of DAC targets genes showed no promoter DNA methylation in normal colon but gained methylation in cancer. Depsi changed the expression of 35% of the transcriptome and showed little specificity for gene upregulation or silenced genes. S2101, UNC0638, and GSK343 had limited effects on their own (<1.5% of the transcriptome), but UNC0638 and GSK343 preferentially targeted genes with H3K9me2 or H3K27me3, respectively. DAC combined with histone methylation inhibitors led to synergistic gene upregulation while still maintaining specificity for DNA methylated and silenced genes. These synergistic genes had limited overlap, indicating the possibility to target distinct sets of genes based on different epigenetic therapy combinations. IPA analysis demonstrated that these genes are enriched in cancer pathways, and consistent with this analysis, the combination therapies were able to decrease cancer cell proliferation more effectively than monotherapy. Broadly similar results were seen with genome wide studies in both breast cancer (MCF7) and leukemia (HL-60) cells.

In our clinical experience with permanently modified cells, disease clearance happens over 14-21 days, which correlates with the window of efficacy of mRNA CARs.

        "Background":"[\"Besides its important role in organismal development, NOTCH receptor signaling exerts tissue specific proliferative or antiproliferative functions. While the oncogenic role of NOTCH has been extensively investigated due to its constitutive activation in T-cell leukemias and several epithelial cancers, little is known about NOTCH mediated tumor suppression. We have previously reported that in Ewing's sarcoma, a pediatric bone tumor driven by the chimeric ETS oncogene EWS-FLI1, auto-stimulatory NOTCH signaling is suppressed and that reactivation results in p53 and consequently growth inhibitory p21 induction via activation of the NOTCH effector HEY1. We now demonstrate that HEY1-mediated p53 stimulation is accompanied by C-terminal p53 acetylation as a consequence of downregulation of nuclear deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). We found that both EWS-FLI1 and HEY1 bind to the SIRT1 promoter with opposite transcriptional consequences. Thus, knockdown of EWS-FLI1 and ectopic HEY1 expression resulted in similar SIRT1 modulation and p53 acetylation which could be reversed by ectopically expressed SIRT1. Consistent with these results, treatment of Ewing's sarcoma cell lines with the sirtuin inhibitor Tenovin 6 resulted in massive cell death. Immunohistochemical analysis of more than 310 Ewing's sarcoma samples identified moderate (25%-50% positive nuclei) to strong (>50% positive nuclei) SIRT1 expression in 35% of cases. Additional 20% showed sporadic positivity (between 10-25% positive nuclei). The involvement of SIRT1 in tumor suppressive NOTCH signaling is not restricted to Ewing's sarcoma, but also relevant at least to B-cell malignancies and some normal tissues, since we found that in several B-cell leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and in keratinocytes HEY1 was able to lead to activating p53 acetylation in a SIRT1 suppression-dependent manner.

        "Background":"['Cancers of the head and neck are difficult to treat because both the therapy and the tumor impact essential functions such as speech and swallowing and they can significantly alter facial appearance. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade is one of the major signaling pathways that leads to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell survival. There are three RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) and together, they are mutated in about 30% of human cancers. RAS can also be activated by upstream signaling. Paradoxically RAF inhibition induces RAF-dimerization and causes subsequent activation of MEK/ERK pathway in presence of activated RAS in melanoma. Similarly the ABL inhibitor nilotinib acts as weak inhibitor of RAF kinase and also induces RAF-dimerization and subsequent activation of MEK/ERK in the presence of activated RAS in leukemia and pancreatic cancer cells. Nilotinib synergizes with MEK inhibitition to kill nilotinib-resistant leukemia cells (Abl T351I). We hypothesized that nilotinib and the MEK inhibitor MEK162 would be synergistic in HNSCC due to the frequent activation of RAS via upstream growth factor receptors. RAS mutations are relatively uncommon in HNSCC. We screened 60 validated HNSCC cell lines through sequenome analysis and we found three HNSCC cell lines with activating HRAS mutations (G12D and Q61L) [5%]. We found that nilotinib induces significant RAF dimerization and subsequent activation of MEK-ERK pathway irrespective of RAS mutational status. We next investigated how paradoxical MEK/ERK pathway activation affected the growth of HNSCC cells. In this context we treated a panel of HNSCC cell lines harboring WT and mutated HRAS with nilotinib and MEK162. Nilotinib alone had nearly no effect on cell viability and MEK162 had a moderate effect on some HNSCC lines. The combination of nilotinib and MEK162 synergized to inhibit the growth of HNSCC cells independent of RAS mutational status. The drug combination led to an accumulation of cells in G1 and a significant reduction in cell proliferation as measured with BrDU incorporation and colony formation. HNSCC cells with mutant HRAS undergo apoptosis in presence of both the drugs. In contrast none of these drugs induce senescence in HNSCC cell lines. Here we show that in HNSCC, nilotinib as single agent drives the paradoxical activation of RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in RAS mutation-independent manner and we uncovered a synthetic lethal pathway that can be used treat HNSCC.

Our work demonstrated that breast CSCs are able to mediate spontaneous lung metastasis in patient-derived breast tumor xenografts (PDXs) in vivo (PNAS, 2010). We further characterized the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of spontaneous metastases versus primary breast tumors. We collected the tumor cells from the lungs and conducted orthotopic implantation back into the mouse mammary fat pads in order to make a more metastatic tumor model. Surprisingly, relative to the parental primary breast tumors, the lung metastasis (met)-derived mammary tumors exhibited a slower growth rate and a reduced metastatic potential with a more differentiated epithelial status based on gene array analyses. The up-regulated genes in the met-derived tumors included promoters of cell adhesion and differentiation as well as tumor suppressors and cell cycle inhibitors, such as KRT19 (CK19), CEACAM1 (CD66a), and CDKN1A. Many of the down-regulated genes were promoters of self-renewal, cell motility, and cell cycle, such as EZH2, SMAD2, and CCNB1. Clinically, this signature correlated with breast tumor subtypes. Consistently, the differentiation scores of the lung met-derived tumors were significantly higher than the primary tumors (p = 0.007). We then examined the functions of microRNA candidates in regulating CSC-mediated metastasis and therapy resistance as well as their clinical relevance.By miRNA analyses, thirty-two miRNAs were differentially expressed with twenty-seven miRNAs being up-regulated in the met-derived tumors, including miR-200 family members which induce epithelial phenotype and inhibits self-renewal, miR-30 family members, miR-138, and others. Further clinical studies demonstrated that miR-30c is independently associated with favorable distant relapse free survival of breast tumor patients (GSE22216 n = 210). Subsequent mechanistic work characterized that miR-30c inhibits both CSC-mediated metastasis and chemotherapy resistance by a direct targeting of cytoskeleton genes twinfilin TWF1 and vimentin (VIM). We also identified miR-138 as a novel regulator of invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells, acting by directly targeting the polycomb epigenetic regulator EZH2. Notably, based on the UNC breast tumor database analyses (n = 337), the miR-138 activity signature served as a novel independent prognostic marker for patient survival beyond traditional pathologic variables, intrinsic subtypes or a proliferation gene signature. Both miR-30c and miR-138 can be regulated by the transcription factor GATA3.

        "Background":"['In CLL, an immunosuppressive phenotype enables the malignant B cell to evade immune detection leading to immune suppression. In recent years, epigenetic changes prompted by proteins known as histone deacetylases (HDACs) have gained special attention predominantly because of their active role in the regulation of pathogenesis and immune-related pathways in CLL; though the precise mechanism by which these regulatory events take place has yet to be elucidated. In addition to the well-recognized role of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) in the control of cell cycle and apoptosis, HDACi have a potential role in modulating the immunobiology of CLL. Remarkably, HDACi alter the inflammatory status of immune cells and tumor cells themselves. Among the family of HDACs, we have recently demonstrated that HDAC6 has a regulatory role in transcriptional regulation of IL-10, and is responsible for T cell anergy in murine and human antigen presenting cells.Activation of T-cells is predominantly dependent on both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules, including PD-1/PD-L1 as well as CTLA4-B7, OX40-OX40L, CD40-CD154, GAL9-TIM3, and 41BBL/41BB. Furthermore, most of these molecules have been identified to have epigenetically induced changes in expression.Previously we had reported that expression of HDAC6 is increased in CLL patient samples. Recent studies from our lab show that selective HDAC6 inhibitors modify the expression of immunomodulatory molecules, which may ultimately lead to increases in the immunogenicity of CLL. Thus far, findings from our lab reveal that CLL cells treated with HDAC6i show 1) a dose dependent cell kill, 2) a reduction of IL-10an important cytokine in the regulation of cell proliferation in CLL, and 3) synergistic reduction of viability when combined with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. Subsequently, we have also demonstrated that MEC2-HDAC6KD cells exhibit an increase in MHCII and a decrease in PD-L1 expression. Interestingly, we also observed a decrease in the expression of PD-L1 and other immune checkpoint markers in CLL cell lines treated with low-doses of HDAC6i. Additionally, malignant B cells isolated from euTCL1 mice and treated ex vivo with HDAC6i become more immunogenic and elicit greater type I allogeneic T cell immune response. Lastly, utilizing our in vivo CLL murine models (euTCL1, and euTCL1-HDAC6KO), we have been able to demonstrate a reduction in circulating lymphocytes in euTCL1-HDAC6KO, as well as euTCL1 mice receiving systemic administration of HDAC6i.In conclusion, selective inhibition of HDAC6 in CLL results in the reduction of co-inhibitory molecules, dose dependent increases in cell killing as single treatment as well as strong synergy when combined with ibrutinib. These findings could provide a successful combination immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of CLL.']",

We previously reported that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its family growth factors is mediated by the heterotrimeric G protein alpha inhibitory (Gi). Herein we demonstrated that Gi proteins are able to differentially regulate RTKs-mediated activation of the ERK and the Akt/mTORC1 pathways. Loss of Gi proteins in MEFs impaired activation of the ERK pathway by EGF, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and Insulin, but not basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Intriguingly, while activation of the Akt/mTORC1 pathway by EGF and bFGF was severely defective in Gi protein deficient cells, this activation was only slightly reduced in response to insulin and IGF. Also, Gi proteins were able to alter activation of the Akt/mTORC1 and the ERK pathways by serum and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in a dose dependent manner. To further understand that how Gi proteins differentially regulate RTK-mediated activation of the Akt/mTORC1 and ERK pathways, we performed an immuno-precipitation study. Our results showed that growth factors were able to induce the association of Gi proteins with growth factor receptors and their downstream adaptor proteins. Loss of Gi proteins in MEFs impaired the association of growth factor receptors with their adaptor proteins indicating that Gi proteins act downstream of RTKs but upstream of the adaptor proteins. Finally, we examined a role of Gi proteins in cancer biology. Similar to results obtained from Gi deficient MEFs, knockdown of Gi proteins in several human cancer cell lines diminished activation of the Akt/mTORC1 and the ERK pathways by growth factors. As a result, Gi protein deficiency inhibited cancer cell growth and migration. Given the fact that growth factors and their receptor pathways play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer, our findings may promote further understanding the molecular mechanism underline RTK signaling regulation in cancer biology and may have implications for cancer therapy.

        "Background":"['Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most prevalent cancer of the pancreas with a 5-year survival rate of 6%, making it the 4th most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. One of the challenges related to this cancer is the issue of chemoresistance. Chemoresistance renders most drugs ineffective in the treatment of PDAC, including kinase inhibitors and the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine. PIM (Proviral Integration site for the Moloney murine leukemia virus) kinases are a family of proteins shown to play an important role in the chemoresistance of many cancers, including pancreatic cancer. PIMs act downstream of the JAK-STAT cytokine signaling pathway and phosphorylate substrates involved in numerous cell functions including cell cycle progression and apoptosis. One objective of our research was to determine the role of PIM kinases on transformed phenotypes of PDAC cells. We were able to demonstrate that the PIM kinase inhibitor SGI-1776 and TP-3654, a second generation PIM kinase inhibitor, were able to inhibit growth in cell viability assay. Also, the PIM inhibitors were able to decrease various phenotypes such as anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. A second objective was to determine if PIM kinase inhibitors could reduce chemoresistance in PDAC cells. PIM inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine decreased cell viability in PDAC cells significantly more than when administered separately. To investigate resistance pathways activated in PDAC cells after treatment with PIM kinase inhibitors, we applied multiplexed inhibitor beads (MIBs) mass spectrometry (MS) to profile the kinome. We observed numerous kinases that were downregulated or upregulated after treatment. One of the kinases upregulated was IKK, a key kinase in the anti-apoptotic NF-B signaling pathway. Our results suggest that PIM kinases are an important target for cell growth and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer. Also, these results suggest that treating PDAC cells with a PIM inhibitor simultaneously with an IKK inhibitor might prevent the effects of resistance pathways. Overall, our studies demonstrate that kinome profiling is an effective strategy to identify cellular responses to PIM kinase inhibitors as well as other drugs for treating pancreatic and other cancers.']",

        "Background":"['In vitro characterization of reagents efficacy in the context of cancer immunotherapy is a necessary step before moving to more expensive animal models and clinical studies. However, current in use in vitro assays like Chromium-51, ATP-based luminescence or flow cytometry are either difficult to implement in high throughput environment or are mainly based on end point methodologies that are unable to capture the full dynamic of the immune response. Here we present the adaptation of an impedance-based platform to monitoring cytotoxic activity of immune cells activated trough different means. Impedance technology detects cell death and proliferation of adherent cells by measuring changes in conductance of microelectrodes embedded in 96 and 384-wells cell culture plates. We utilized adherent and B cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines as well as primary tumor cells as in vitro models for immunotherapy reagents evaluation. We seeded the cells on electrodes coated 96-well plates and monitored cell adhesion and proliferation for 24 hours. The following day effector cells were added at multiple effector', 'target ratios in presence of BiTEs antibodies and/or anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. Impedance signal was monitored for up to seven days. Control wells were set up with effector cells only or with target plus effector cells but without antibodies. We adapted such adhesion-based technology to monitor non-adherent B-leukemia/lymphoma cells, by developing a strategy where the wells are coated with an anti-CD40 antibody. The coating allows specific adhesion and retention of B cells and measurement of changes in impedance that are proportional to cell number. Using increasing concentrations of EpCAM/CD3 BiTE we demonstrated the suitability of such impedance-based approach to quantitatively monitor the efficacy of immune cells-mediated cancer cell killing both under different effector', 'target ratios and antibody concentrations. Combination treatments with checkpoint reduced timing and increased amount of killed cancer cells. Similar results were also obtained with engineered Car-T cells against CD19 or NK cell lines, we were able to demonstrate specific killing of tumor B cells at very low effector', 'target ratios. The results were also confirmed by flow cytometry. Overall, our results demonstrate the value of such approach in measuring the cytotoxic response across the temporal scale, an aspect that is otherwise very difficult to assess with more canonical end point assays. Furthermore, the availability of 384-wells format and minimal sample handling place the technology in an ideal spot for applications in large reagent validation screening or personalized medicine, like therapeutic protocol validation directly on patient samples.']",

Nevertheless, its capacity of promoting primary B-ALL proliferation was abolished once the cell line was induced to differentiate into adipocytes.

Consistently, we observed that the increase of numbers and diameters of adipocytes was correlated with remission after chemotherapy treatments in B-ALL patients. By comparing the global transcription profiles between the BM stromal cells and the adipocytes that were derived from the cell line, we identified a combination of cytokines and adherent proteins that were able to support the long-term growth of human primary B-ALL cells and desensitize them to chemotherapy drugs in a stromal-free culture condition.

The NHEIII1 upstream of P1 promoter regulates up to 80% of c-Myc transcription, and comprises a C/G rich region able to form G-quadruplex structure (Pu27). G-quadruplex forming motifs seem to be abundant in the genome, located in the promoter region of oncogenes. We identify 13 new potential G-quadruplex forming motifs with more than 90% identity with Pu27, located in different chromosomes of the human genome and none near gene promoter regions.Methods', ' BLAT search was used to identify the homologous sequences of Pu27.

The evaluation of a dose response/time course for Pu27 (Chr8), Pu5- (Chr5) and Pu9- (Chr9) on growth inhibition of U937, K562, HL-60 and Raji show a difference in sensitivity of the cell lines to the oligonucleotide sequences (Raji (more sensitive than)>U937>K562>HL-60), and a difference in efficiency of the oligonucleotide sequences (Pu27>Pu5->Pu9-).

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis remain poorly understood and no effective approaches are available to cure metastasis. The identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem cell properties, has brought us a new perspective on cancer, including leukemia and solid tumors. CSCs are proposed to mediate cancer relapse and metastasis due to their resistance to conventional therapies. Our work has demonstrated that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are able to mediate spontaneous lung metastases in human-in-mouse xenograft models. We have also identified that miR-30c, a human breast tumour prognostic marker, regulates both invasion and chemo-resistance, through targeting TWF1, VIM, and downstream IL-11. TWF1 encodes an actin-binding protein and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). An IL-6 family member, IL-11 was identified as a secondary target of TWF1 in the miR-30c signalling pathway. Expression of miR-30c inversely correlated with TWF1 and IL-11 levels in primary breast tumors and low IL-11 correlated with relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients. Our study demonstrates that miR-30c is transcriptionally regulated by GATA3 in breast tumors. Identification of a novel miRNA-mediated pathway that regulates chemo-resistance in breast cancer will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Future ongoing interactive basic and translational research directions include', ' (1) to understand CSCs using cutting-edge single cell sequencing technology and functional studies; (2) to image CSCs (their dynamic behavior and interactions with immune cells and non-CSCs) during metastasis using bioluminescence imaging and intravital imaging systems; and (3) to target CSCs with novel therapeutics delivered by nanoparticles.']",

We have profiled a panel of AML tumor cell lines and tumor xenografts for both expression and activity of Pgp/MDR1 via FACS and MSD;.

We have evaluated the sensitivity of the AML models to a series of standard of care therapies, including auristatins, in both in vitro and in vivo studies. These payloads alone or when conjugated to antibodies as antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are known substrates of the ABC transporters, Using Pgp inhibitors, we could restore the sensitivity of the MDR expressing cells to the cytotoxic drugs and ADCs, which confirmed that the drugs were MDR substrates. These inhibitors could also block the activity of the Pgp pump. We have also observed limited activity in vivo with these ADCs when used in a MDR positive model. Our initial observation indicates that a threshold level of activity of MDR1 may be critical to confer resistance to these standard of care molecules and antibody drug conjugates using similar payloads.

        "Background":"['The prognosis of patients with malignant glioma remains extremely poor despite surgery and improvement in radio and chemo therapies. Unfortunately few drugs cross the blood-brain barrier. Therapeutic treatment with chemotherapy agents, e.g., temozolomide, 1,3 bis (2-chloroethinyl)-1 nitrosurea carmustine wafers or tipifarnib have not significantly improved patient survival. Mifepristone has been found to provide significant palliative benefit to both mice with various types of malignancies and also humans with a wide variety of advanced cancers no longer or unresponsive to chemotherapy. The hypothesized mechanism of action is that tumor cells either directly secrete or cause gamma delta T cells in the tumor microenvironment to secrete a similar immunomodulatory protein as in normal pregnancies which inhibits natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and causes a shift from thymic helper (TH)1 cytokines which stimulate cellular immune responses to TH2cytokines which evoke a humoral response. This protein is called the progesterone induced blocking factor (PIBF). The hypothesis suggests that also similar to pregnancy, progesterone or a P-like substance secreted by the tumor up-regulates PIBF response. Mifepristone has been found to down-regulate PIBF expression from human leukemia cell lines. Whether this is the precise mechanism of action or not, the progesterone receptor antagonist seems to inhibit tumor growth and provide extended and better quality of life. The objective of the present study was to determine if mifepristone may cross the blood brain barrier and provide a palliative benefit to patients with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme. A 43 year old male with a large glioblastoma multiforme grade IV malignant brain tumor arising originally from the temporal lobe with metastases to the spinal cord was told that he was no longer a candidate for anymore chemo or radiation therapy. He was advised that death should occur within 2 months. Indeed 2 months later death was considered imminent. He slept most of the day and was unable to converse. He was completely paralyzed from the neck down and his hands were in a clenched position. After 2 weeks of taking 200mg/day of mifepristone he became alert and was able to carry out intelligent conversations. He was now able to open his hand. He remained alert for 3 months, but paralysis had spread making swallowing difficult. He could not longer ingest the mifepristone. He died 2 weeks later. This case proves that mifepristone can cross the blood brain barrier and provide palliative benefits for grade IV glioblastoma multiforme. It is well tolerated with minimal or no side effects at this dosage. In view of the paucity of effective therapy for this type of cancer, mifepristone should be given consideration for treatment earlier than this extremely advanced stage.']",

        "Background":"['All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have tumor-suppressive capacity by their ability to promote differentiation and inhibit proliferation, mainly in leukemia, however in other tumor types the treatment with ATRA is restricted because not all the patients have the same results. ATRA is able to modulate the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways and promote differentiation in neuronal cells by a transcription independent mechanism. In lung cancer cells this non genomic mechanism by ATRA is able to active the PI3K signaling pathway and trigger cellular processes like invasion and survival. Nevertheless is unknown if ERK could be modulated by ATRA in lung cancer cells. We investigated the effects of ATRA on the activation of ERK pathway in the ATRA-resistant A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. The phosphorylated form of ERK was detected by western blot within 5 and 15 min after ATRA treatment. Further evaluation using specific RAR antagonists, AGN 193109 and Ro 41-5253, which prevent expression of ATRA target genes, showed the same effect over ERK. To elucidate the potential crosstalk between PI3K and ERK signaling, we used cells pretreated with wortmannin, a potent and specific PI3K inhibitor, and showed that wortmannin alone or in combination with ATRA increased the activation of ERK. These data suggest that PI3K negatively regulate ERK phosphorylation through the signaling complex ATRA/RAR. As we reported previously, ATRA does not induce significant changes on proliferation, however, the combination of ATRA with PD98059, the pharmacological inhibitor of MEK-ERK, decreases proliferation by 50%. These results suggest that activation of ERK is involved in blocking the classical anti-proliferative effects of ATRA in A549 cell line. Moreover, ERK pathway activation promotes anti-apoptosis in response to ATRA treatment in A549 cells. In addition, wound healing assay in presence of PD98059 showed that migration promoted by ATRA in A549 cells can be delayed. Our results indicate that ATRA activates the ERK signaling pathway by a transcription independent mechanism through signaling cascade, which involves RAR and PI3K modulating the ERK activation. This signaling pathway promotes proliferation, survival and migration in lung cancer cells. The inhibition of ERK signaling pathway restores the anti-tumoral effects of ATRA. It is interesting to speculate that using a combination of ERK and PI3K inhibitors may improve the tumor-suppressive activity of ATRA in lung cancer patients.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['Circulating tumor cells (CTC) released from primary tumor tissues into bloodstream or lymphatic vessels are emerging as novel tools in the detection and prognosis of several types of metastatic cancers. At present, CTC markers are limited to epithelial cancers and there are no specific markers available to detect mesenchymal and epithelial-mesenchymal transformed (EMT) CTCs. EMT cells are characterized by increased motility and invasiveness and are known to escape detection technologies that use EpCAM and cytokeratins as CTC markers. Here we report a novel antibody, 84-1 for detection of mesenchymal and EMT CTC. Antibodies were raised in mice after injecting metastatic cancer cells and clones were selected that were positive only for CTC and negative for PBMCs and normal cells. 84-1 was the only antibody that was unique in its ability to detect CTCs from mesenchymal tumors and EMT CTC from epithelial tumors. Studies for characterization of the epitope for 84-1 antibody are ongoing. We then analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody by utilizing spiking assay and were able to specifically detect and isolate as low as one cell from 1 ml of blood. In a pilot analysis, we were able to detect CTCs from patients with colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and leukemia with very high specificity, while CTCs were not observed in healthy subjects. CTCs were characterized based on the size of the nucleus and for 84-1 positivity and CD45 negativity using fluorescence microscopy. The CTCs from cancer patients were isolated and cultured for mutational analysis. CTCs were also detectable in the blood of mice with tumors of both epithelial (colon) and non-epithelial (osteosarcoma) origin and were isolated and cultured in vitro, which formed colonies of cells that were used for further analysis to confirm the identity of CTCs. Furthermore, we also evaluated CTCs in mutant p53 mice that developed spontaneous tumors of both mesenchymal and epithelial origin. Collectively, our observations provide a novel technology to selectively detect and isolate both mesenchymal and EMT CTC. Detection and molecular characterization of CTCs is one of the fastest growing areas of translational cancer research. Utilizing our antibody, we can enumerate and isolate rare CTCs that will aid in the early detection of tumors, metastasis, and relapse and will contribute to the development of specific targeted therapies, an ultimate goal of personalized medicine.']",

        "Background":"['The interferon stimulated protein ISG15 was one of the first ubiquitin-like modifiers discovered. Similar to ubiquitin, ISG15 is conjugated to cellular proteins through a three-step enzymatic cascade involving an activating enzyme E1 (UBE1L), a conjugating enzyme E2 and a ligase E3. Conjugated ISG15 is removed from substrate proteins by the UBE1L-ISG15 deconjugase Usp18 (UBP43). To date, few direct target proteins of the ISG15 system were found and the biologic implications of their ISG15ylation are actively under study. We previously reported that the G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) was a direct target of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Prior work by others found that G0S2 was able to regulate lipolysis by inhibiting adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The current study extends prior work by reporting that G0S2 was induced in APL cells by RA-treatment coordinately with UBE1L, ISG15 and the deconjugase Usp18. G0S2 was also shown to be a previously unrecognized target of ISG15ylation. G0S2 species were co-immunoprecipitated with ISG15. The functional consequence of this modification was confirmed by finding that G0S2 protein stability was directly affected by the ISG15 deconjugase Usp18. Loss of Usp18 expression by transfection of individual siRNAs into studied cells led to G0S2 protein destabilization. In contrast, engineered gain of Usp18 expression in the same cells stabilized G0S2 protein. Agents that can inhibit specific protein degradation pathways were also examined. Findings revealed that G0S2 protein was stabilized by treatment with proteasome or caspase inhibitors, but was not affected by lysosome or aggresome inhibitors. Thus, these findings indicate that G0S2 is a novel ISG15 substrate and that this modification substantially reduces G0S2 protein stability. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic basis for cross-talk between interferon and retinoid signaling at the level of the G0S2 protein that undergoes ISG15ylation. This provides evidence for a role of lipolysis regulation in both interferon and retinoid signaling. The functional consequences of this are under study in mouse models.']",

        "Background":"[\"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a B-cell neoplasia characterized by clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Although currently available therapies can improve patient's overall survival, it still remains incurable in most of them cases. On the other hand, the use of autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-redirected T-cells have allowed to achieve long-term durable remissions in patients with B cell leukemia, indicating that CAR technology may become a new alternative in cancer treatment. Extensive research is therefore being made in immunotherapy against MM, in order to identify novel antigenic targets to be considered for this approach.In the present work we have assessed the feasibility of CAR-mediated targeting of the CS1 antigen (SLAMF7), which is highly expressed on tumor cells from most patients with MM. However, expression of CS1 on normal CD8+ T-cells is potentially an obstacle for the development of CAR T-cells against this protein, since antigen-expressing T cells will be targeted, impacting both on the number and the phenotype of the final CAR T cell population.To address this limitation, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) gene editing technology was used to inactivate the CS1 gene in T-cells, prior to transduction with a lentiviral vector encoding an anti-CS1 CAR. Our results demonstrate that while non-gene-edited T-cells expressing the anti-CS1 CAR display cytotoxic activity against MM cell lines, CS1-gene-edited CAR cells display significantly increased cytotoxic activity. In addition, a progressive loss of CD8+ T-cells was observed in non-edited CAR+ T-cells, while this population was preserved in CS1 knockout T-cells.Gene editing technology was also used here to inactivate the TCRa constant (TRAC) gene, minimizing the potential for engineered T-cells to mediate Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). We have indeed previously shown that editing of the TRAC gene can be achieved at high frequencies, allowing efficient production of TCR-deficient T-cells that no longer mediate alloreactivity in a xeno-GvHD mouse model. Furthermore, we were able to perform multiplex genome editing that led to the production of double KO (TRAC and CS1) T-cellsFinally, we evaluated the in vivo activity of double knockout CAR T-cells (UCARTCS1) by performing experiments in an orthotopic MM mouse model, showing that CS1 disrupted T-cells were able to mediate an in vivo anti-tumoral activity.Our results show that multiplex genome editing is possible and can lead to the production of double KO TRAC/CS1 T-cells, allowing large scale manufacturing of allogeneic, non alloreactive CS1 specific T-cells with enhanced antitumor activity. Moreover, these allogenic T-cells could be easily available for administration to a large number of MM patients.\"]",

The better efficiency of BEAesc is associated to a marked immediate hematologic toxicity and a higher risk of secondary myelodysplasia/leukemia. Also, the gonadal toxicity which is a real concern in young women, is quite higher when using BEAesc. So, to better manage HL treatment we need to identify early responding patients able to benefit from a strategy of dose intensity decrease after upfront BEAesc, without impairing the disease control.

Cytarabine depends on the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT-1) for cellular entry (1). Loss of hENT-1 function in vitro has been shown to result in ara-C resistance (2), and reduced hENT-1 expression and activity has been associated with adverse therapeutic outcomes in patients treated with cytarabine (3). The lipophilic ara-C-5 elaidic acid ester of cytarabine (elacytarabine) has shown nucleoside transport independent uptake and long retention of the active nucleotide ara-CTP in a leukemic cell line (4) and may have the ability to overcome resistance due to insufficient transport in the clinical setting. (1). The whole cell bioluminescent biosensor, Escherichia coli HA1 was engineered to produce a measurable bioluminescent output in response to the nucleoside analogue ara-C (5). This was achieved through reduced expression of cytidine deaminase and the insertion of the human deoxycytidine kinase gene and the full lux operon from the Photorhabdus luminescens. The bacterial biosensor is able to monitor both ara-C and ara-CTP.The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the Escherichia coli HA1 biosensor to measure intracellular ara-C and ara-CTP following ex vivo exposure of human cells to elacytarabine and cytarabine.CCRF-CEM cells or blast cells from patients were treated with ara-C or elacytarabine for up to 4 hours in the presence or absence of the hENT inhibitor dipyridamole (DPM). Cells were washed, lysed and the lysate incubated with E. coli HA1 and monitored on a plate reader luminometer. A cell viability assay was also performed to confirm biosensor results.E. coli HA1 produced a measurable response to lysate from CCRF-CEM cells treated with either ara-C or elacytarabine. In the case of ara-C, this response was reduced when cells were incubated with DPM. No such reduction was observed for elacytarabine. When used to treat blast cells derived from leukemic patients, elacytarabine treatment produced a stronger signal from E. coli HA1 than an equivalent concentration of ara-C. Furthermore, the efficacy of elacytarabine was not susceptible to hENT inhibition in patient samples, whereas the efficacy of ara-C was. The findings of this project suggest that the E. coli HA1 biosensor is compatible with elacytarabine and that elacytarabine is able to bypass the effect of hENT inhibition on CCRF-CEM cells and patient derived blast cells.1.

        "Background":"['Our previously studies demonstrated that bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclopenta[a]indenes, which bear a bis(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidine pharmacophore, exhibited potent antitumor activity in inhibiting various human tumor xenografts. We also demonstrated that these agents showed strong synergistic therapeutic efficacy in combination with arsenic trioxide (ATO) against acquire or inherited MDR human tumors in xenograft model (human lung H460 or bladder cancer resistant to cisplatin NTUB1/P). Based on these findings, we have recently synthesized a series of 1,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)indolizino[6,7-b]indols and their bis(alkylcarbomate) derivatives for antitumor evaluation. These new agents were easily prepared starting from L-tryptophane in 5 steps. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that the newly synthesized derivatives possessed a broad spectrum of anticancer activity against human lymphoblastic leukemia and various solid tumor cell growth in vitro. Of these analogues, 1,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-3,6-dimethylindolizino[6,7-b]indole (BO-1922) was selected for further antitumor studies. We found that this agent displayed potent therapeutic efficacy against human colon cancer HT-29, lung adenocarcinoma lung A549, and primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma BX-PC3 xenografts. The antitumor activity of BO-1922 was compared with Irinotecan (CPT-11) in animal xenograft model. It revealed that BO-1922 is more potent than CPT-11 against human colon cancer HT-29 xenograft; complete tumor suppression on day 20 after mice treated with BO-1922 (25 mg/kg, QD4, intravenous injection), while, tumor relapsed on day 9 after mice treated with CPT-11 (60 mg/kg, Q2D3, iv. inj.). Under the same drug administration conditions (dosage and schedule), BO-1922 is as potent as CPT-11 against lung cancer A549 and pancreatic cancer BX-PC3 xenografts. Although the bodyweight of all drug treated mice recovered after ceasing of treatment, it was found that BO-1922 is less toxic to the host based on the average body-weight loss. The alkaline agarose gel shifting assay showed that this agent is able to induce DNA double strand cross-linking. Flow cytomeric assay revealed that BO-1922 induced cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase in non-small cell lung carcinomas H1299. These results suggest that BO-1922 is a promising candidate for clinical application and is currently undergoing preclinical studies.']",

        "Background":"['Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most common pediatric primary bone tumor, and affects children between the ages of 1 to 20 years. With the advancement in therapeutic options the 5-year event free survival rate of patients with localized tumor has gone up to 70%. However, in patients with metastases at diagnosis, this rate is less than 20%. One of the distinguishing hallmarks of ES is the presence of oncogenic fusion transcription factor formed by the translocation between EWS and ETS family transcription factor. The EWS-FLI1 translocation is most commonly found in ES patients. Therefore targeting EWS-FLI1 transcription factor or its downstream targets presents a novel therapeutic approach to treat ES. Research from our group demonstrated the anti-cancer activity of a small molecule, Tolfenamic acid (TA) in pediatric cancers, leukemia, neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. TA has been shown to target transcription factor Sp1, which regulates the expression of several genes associated with cancer including survivin, a member of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family and involved in chemoresistance. It is currently in phase I clinical trials for treating upper gastro-intestinal cancer patients along with radiation. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of TA alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, and its effect on the EWS-FLI1 downstream targets. ES cell lines CHLA9, CHLA10 and TC71 were treated with TA, Etoposide, Doxorubicin and Vincristine and cell viability was measured at 24 and 48h post-treatment. TA and chemotherapeutic drugs caused a dose and time dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. We then assessed the effects of TA in combination with these chemotherapeutic drugs. Results indicate that the combination treatment causes increased (2-3 fold) inhibition of cell viability compared to individual agents. To access the mode of action of combination therapy, cells were treated with TA and Vincristine and apoptosis was monitored at 48h post-treatment via western blot analysis (c-PARP), flow cytometry (Annexin V staining), and caspase 3/7 activity (Caspase3/7-Glo assay). We were able to demonstrate that the inhibition of cell viability in the combination treatment was the result of apoptotic mechanism as determined by increased cleavage of PARP and up-regulation of caspase 3/7activity. In addition we also studied the effects of TA on the regulation of EWS-FLI1 downstream targets NROB1, ID2, ROCO1 and LDB2 by real-time PCR. Results demonstrate that TA treatment leads to the downregulation of EWS-FLI1 genes. Taken together our results indicate that the combination of TA and chemotherapy drugs inhibits the proliferation of sarcoma cells. This investigation also suggests that the proposed combination therapy involving small molecule TA and standard chemotherapeutic agents could be a viable strategy for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women worldwide. The poor prognosis of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is due, in part, to emergence of tumor resistance to chemotherapy. Recent data indicate that human tumors including NSCLC contain a small subset of cancer stem/ progenitor cells (CSC) responsible for drug resistance and tumor maintenance. If such minute subsets of CSC drive tumor formation and drug resistance, therapies targeting the bulk tumor mass but not CSC will fail. We now confirm identification of subpopulations of chemotherapy-resistant human NSCLC cells with enrichment for CSC biomarkers and exhibiting significant CSC activity. We identified CD133+/ALDH+ tumor stem/progenitor cells from human lung cancer cells in vitro using established Aldefluor assays in combination with labeled anti-CD133 antibodies. Estrogen, a known risk factor for lung cancer progression, stimulated a modest increase in the numbers of CSC. In contrast to control CD133-/ALDH- tumor cell subsets, CSC subpopulations grew as tumor spheres and maintained self-renewal capacity in vitro and exhibited a greater tumorigenic capability than non-CSC subsets in vivo, properties indicative of CSC. Furthermore, resistance of CSC-like cells to cisplatin (a standard chemotherapy for NSCLC treatment) was fully reversed by treatment with parthenolide (PTL), a naturally-occurring sesquiterpene lactone compound with strong antitumor activity in leukemia and prostate cancer while sparing normal cells. The antitumor effect of PTL appears due to its action as a potent inhibitor of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) which is markedly activated by chemotherapy. To target CSC and suppress tumor progression, we synthesized and tested novel analogs of PTL with improved antitumor properties and aqueous solubility. PTL analogs inhibit proliferation of H157 NSCLC cells using both bulk cell preparations and CSC-subpopulations, with effects significantly different from control at P<0.05. Dose-dependent increments of PTL analogs increase apoptosis of CSC when compared with bulk cells. Moreover, PTL analogs inhibit cell proliferation of H23, A549 and H1975 NSCLC cells with known resistance to cisplatin (P<0.01). These compounds were able to sensitize cells to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity (P<0.01) when cells were exposed to sub-optimal concentrations of cisplatin. Using Western blots, we find that PTL congeners inhibit phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of phospho-NF-B and activation of IKK/. Thus, targeted inhibition of NF-B may reverse tumor drug resistance by interfering with known NF-B actions to regulate genes involved in proliferation, DNA damage response, antiapoptosis and angiogenesis. Further development of PTL analogs as therapeutics may lead to new strategies to treat NSCLC in the clinic. [Funded by CDMRP Lung Cancer Research Program LC 090297].']",

        "Meeting_name":" The histone deacetylase inhibitor Quisinostat augments the anti-tumor reponses of T-cells",
        "Background":"['It has become increasingly clear that histone deacetylases (HDACs), a family of epigenetic modifiers, play intimate roles in both tumor and immune biology. Indeed, two HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are FDA approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell leukemia, and various others are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of both solid and hematological malignancies. Beyond direct anti-tumor effects, HDACi have shown pronounced abilities to augment the immunogenicity of tumor cells leading to an improved ant-tumor immune response. Furthermore, in addition to anti-tumor effects, several studies have demonstrated a profound ability of HDACi to tip the scale between tolerance and inflammation in antigen presenting cells, leading to enhanced T-cell activation. However, less well studied is the ability of HDACi to directly influence the function and fate of T-cells. Here we report that the HDACi JNJ-264-81585 (Quisinostat) is able to augment the pro-inflammatory phenotype of T-cells in vitro and in vivo. Quisinostat is a hydroxamic acid with potent sub-nanomolar inhibition of several HDACs, and reported anti-tumor activity. Here we report that Quisinostat has a potent HDAC inhibition in T-cells, with sub-nanomolar doses increasing histone 3 acetylation levels in a dose dependent manner. Intriguingly, when treated with Quisinostat in vitro, activated murine CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells produced significantly higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IFN-g, and TNF. Concomitantly, treated T-cells produced decreased levels of IL-6 and IL-17. To determine the efficacy of Quisinostat at augmenting T-cell function in vivo, a novel T-cell adoptive transfer model was utilized. In this model syngeneic T-cells from B6.SJL mice were stained with the proliferation tracking dye CellTrace Violet and activated in the presence of Quisinostat, then subsequently adoptively transferred into sub-lethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipient mice. Analysis of proliferation of transferred T-cells showed that CD8+ T-cells treated with Quisinostat had significantly higher rates of proliferation than those treated with DMSO control. As well, in a result similar to that seen in vitro, adoptively transferred T-cells had skewing towards a predominantly CD8+ composition. Finally, T-cells treated with Quisinostat displayed a reconstitution advantage over DMSO treated cells, with higher percentages of transferred T-cells relative to endogenous T-cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate a profound and important ability of HDAC inhibition to modulate the T-cell response, highlighting a role of HDACi, particularly Quisinostat, in augmenting the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy, giving rationale for clinical investigation.']",

        "Background":"[\"Anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family are known to confer resistance against a variety of therapeutic agents. Among them is myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1), a highly regulated protein at both transcriptional and post-translational levels by a number of signaling pathways. Overexpression of Mcl-1 has been reported in biopsies of prostate cancer patients with high Gleason grades. Currently, novel anti-cancer approaches that aim to inhibit Mcl-1 are being developed. In this study we have analyzed the influence of androgens and androgen receptor (AR) signaling on Mcl-1 protein expression. Western Blot experiments with androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and VCaP showed a consistent upregulation of Mcl-1 protein expression levels under androgen-depleted conditions, i.e. in steroid-free medium. Addition of 0.1-10 nM of the synthetic androgen R1881 decreased Mcl-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner in LNCaP and VCaP cells. This effect could also be observed in the castration-resistant LNCaP-abl cell line, but not in AR-negative PC3 cells. Further analysis showed that regulation of Mcl-1 was dependent on the presence of functional AR since it could not be observed in cells co-treated with R1881 and antiandrogens bicalutamide or hydroxyflutamide or after AR downregulation by siRNA. Quantitative PCR on mRNA levels revealed that Mcl-1 regulation by androgens is at a transcriptional level, while downregulation of the three known Mcl-1 E3 ligases APC/C(CDC20), SCF(FBW7), and HUWE1 (MULE) by siRNA did not influence androgenic regulation of Mcl-1 at the post-translational level. To evaluate a possible role of Mcl-1 as a resistance mechanism in cancer stem cells, its expression in basal cells isolated from patient's biopsies was assessed. The highest expression of Mcl-1 mRNA was observed in tumors isolated from castration therapy resistant patients, followed by therapy nave samples and was the lowest in prostatic cell lines. Interestingly, after isolation of stem cells (SC), transit amplifying (TA) and committed basal (CB) cells, the highest expression of Mcl-1 mRNA could be detected in SC. Our findings indicate that androgenic signaling leads to decreased Mcl-1 expression levels in prostate cancer cell lines, which could be mediated by E2F1 transcription factor known to inhibit Mcl-1 transcription. Vice versa, absent AR signaling leads to upregulated Mcl-1 expression levels. The finding of high Mcl-1 mRNA expression in prostate cancer stem cells that do not express AR supports the hypothesis that Mcl-1 could be involved in resistance mechanisms against first- and second-line therapies. Therefore, anti-Mcl-1 therapies might be considered to improve the efficacy of androgen ablation and could furthermore target prostate cancer stem cells.\"]",

        "Background":"[\"Hsp90 is a component of a molecular chaperone complex, involved in the folding, maturation and stabilisation of key signaling molecules which control cell proliferation, survival and transformation. It works by a modulation of a set of cancer-associated proteins, collectively referred to as clients'. Inhibition of Hsp90 causes simultaneous destabilization and eventual degradation of client proteins that result in suppression of tumor growth, and a number of novel synthetic HSP90 inhibitors are currently under oncology clinical investigations for the treatment of a wide variety of tumor types. SST0116CL1 (property of sigma-tau Research Switzerland S.A.) is a potent, second generation, small-molecule HSP90 inhibitor, with a chemical structure (4-amino substituted resorcino-isoxazole) unrelated to the first generation ansamycin family of HSP90 inhibitors. SST0116CL1 binds to the ATP binding pocket of HSP90, and interferes with HSP90 chaperone function thus resulting in client protein degradation and tumor growth inhibition. In in vitro studies, SST0116CL1 was shown to inhibit recombinant HSP90 and to induce the degradation of the oncogenic Her2 tyrosine kinase in BT-474 human breast cancer cells. Moreover, it was able to induce the destabilization and depletion of different client proteins, often overexpressed and constitutively activated in numerous types of hematological or solid human tumors. These results correlated well with those obtained from the cell proliferation assay as well as with the HSP90 competitive binding assay, and clearly suggested that target modulation of HSP90 was achieved. In preclinical in vivo studies, in different solid and hematological tumor xenograft models, such as A431 epidermoid carcinoma with EGFR overexpression, GTL-16 gastric carcinoma with c-Met overexpression, MV4;11 B-myelomonocytic leukemia with flt3 mutation, A2780/Dx multidrug resistant ovarian carcinoma with P-glycoprotein overexpression, SST0116CL1 delivered intravenously or intraperitoneally revealed a potency at least comparable or higher than that found with the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922, under Phase II clinical trials investigation, or chemotherapeutic drugs currently used in cancer therapy. SST0116CL1 showed to be a manageable compound when given according to different schedules (qd5x/w; q4d/w; q2dx3/w), since it was well-tolerated and active to inhibit the tumor growth. A modulation of PD biomarkers in terms of down-regulation of EGFR, AKT and CDK4 was reached in tumor lesions of A431 tumor bearing mice treated with SST0116CL1 and a down-regulation of c-Met, AKT and CDK4 was observed in tumors collected from GTL-16 tumor bearing mice. PK parameters demonstrated a rapid clearance of SST0116CL1 from normal tissues and a blood compartment with prolonged retention in tumors. On the complex, these results strongly encourage the selection of SST0116CL1 as a promising candidate for clinical trial.\"]",

        "Background":"['Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely utilized in multiple clinical settings to lessen the effects of neutropenia. Although clearly beneficial, a particular concern is that G-CSF therapy may increase the risk of MDS and or AML. The most striking example is that of Severe Congenital Neutropenia (SCN). While G-CSF clearly improves survival on SCN patients, there are several lines of evidence to suggest that G-CSF treatment contributes to development of leukemia. We hypothesize that G-CSF induced excessive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation leads to DNA damage and genome instability. To test our premise, mice were treated with G-CSF for 4 months and bone marrow cells were analyzed. Results demonstrated a 3 fold increase in the LSK population and a 2 fold increase in the amount of dsDNA breaks via the presence of nuclear pH2AX. To determine if the G-CSF induced proliferation lead to chromosome alterations, we performed array CGH analyses. DNA from bone marrow cells from animals treated with G-CSF for 4 months were compared to untreated mice. Our results demonstrate variations in several chromosome regions. FISH analysis of Lin-Sca+ bone marrow cells confirmed loss on regions of chromosome 2 (6%) and 17 (30%). Since prolonged G-CSF exposure promotes genomic instability in HSCs we hypothesize that an alternative strategy would be to co-administer a drug that selectively blocks the effect of G-CSF on HSCs. Previous studies suggested genistein as an attractive compound with excellent bioavalibity that has anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative properties. Mice were concomitant treated with G-CSF and genistein 3 times a week. Genistein partially blocked the G-CSF induced proliferation of LSK cells, measured by BrdU incorporation, and reduced pH2AX levels in this population by 40%. This was also accompanied by a reduction in LSK cells with an abnormal FISH signal (50% reduction). Importantly, genistein did not block the G-CSF driven expansion of mature neutrophils as total number of neutrophils in mice treated with G-CSF and genistein are the same as those treated with G-CSF alone. We demonstrate that G-CSF treatment induces GSK3 phosphorylation and Cyclin D1 and D3 expression. Genistein blocked GSK3 phosphorylation and Cyclin D1 and D3 induction. Collectively, our results imply that prolonged G-CSF treatment induces DNA damage in HSCs by initiating cell cycle progression. HSCs are long lived, quiescent cells that utilize NHEJ, a relatively error prone process, for DNA repair when progressing from G0 to G1. We demonstrate, that genistein, at levels obtainable through oral supplementation, is able to reduce DNA damage by attenuating G-CSF induced HSC proliferation without compromising G-CSFs ability to accelerate terminal neutrophilic differentiation. These results suggest that genistein may be an effective therapeutic agent in patients with SCN who require prolonged G-CSF support']",

        "Background":"['The chromosomal translocation t(7;11)(p15,p15), that results in the oncogenic fusion protein Nup98-Hoxa9 (NH), appears in 1% of patients with AML and is associated with very poor prognosis and short overall survival. Despite the large severity of the leukemia induced by this fusion protein, the oncogenic events triggered by NH are poorly understood, although a potential role as an aberrant transcription factor has been proposed. We have generated a human Hematopoietic Progenitors (hHP) cellular model expressing NH constitutively to identify the molecular mechanisms supporting the malignancy of this fusion protein, facilitating the search for therapeutic targets.We identified the DNA binding sites of NH by performing ChIP-seq experiments, which were validated by qRT-PCR analysis on ChIP selected DNA and Luciferase assays. Expression profiling was performed in hHP-NH and co-Immunoprecipitations (Co-IPs) were done to demonstrate the interaction of NH with different transcriptional regulators. Specific drug sensitivity of the hHP-NH model was assessed in cell proliferation assays.Our work provides the first description of the DNA binding sites of NH, most of which are regulatory regions of genes involved in the development of AML. In particular, we demonstrate that NH induces the overexpression of MEIS1, HOXA9 and PBX3, transcription factors forming an activator complex that is a key element in the leukemic onset driven by other chromosome rearrangements. Interestingly, we show that NH directly interacts with this complex through Pbx3. To evaluate the biological relevance of the interaction of the MEIS1-HOXA9-PBX3 complex with NH, we have analyzed the sensitivity of hHP-NH to the HXR9 peptide (an inhibitor of the HOXA9-PBX3 interaction). Supporting our hypothesis, we observed an inhibitory effect on hHP-NH viability after HXR9 treatment. Finally, by combining the expression profile data from hHP-NH and the ChIP-seq results using GSEA analysis, we show that NH is able to induce both overexpression and down-regulation of its target genes. To provide evidences of the activator-repressor role of NH, we performed different Co-IPs that demonstrated its direct interaction with both p300 (transcriptional activator) and HDAC1 (transcriptional inhibitor).Taken together, we show that the direct overexpression of the complex MEIS1-HOXA9-PBX3 is one of the pathogenic mechanisms induced by NH. As expected, the disruption of this complex with the HXR9 peptide in the hHP-NH model has a direct effect on cell viability. Furthermore, we show that NH interacts with this complex via PBX3 and also with p300 and HDAC1. The features and architecture of these interactions need to be further explored, but these findings allow us to consider the use of the HXR9 peptide or some HDAC inhibitors as possible treatments for these patients.']",
