        "Background":"['Almost 80% of glioblastoma tumors have alterations in the CNKN2A-CDK-Rb pathway. Cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) act as cell cycle regulators and have been recognized as therapeutic targets for glioblastoma (GBM). In the current study, we determined the antitumor activity of CDK4/6 inhibition (palbociclib and abemaciclib) alone and in combination with radiation on a panel of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The GSCs were molecularly characterized using multiple omimcs techniques and Western blots identified specific phospho- and total protein levels. Approximately 50% of cell lines have homozygous deletion of CDKN2A although CDK4 and CDK6 protein expression was significantly elevated in most of the GSCs. RB protein was constitutively phosphorylated in only a subset (45%)', ' GSC11, GSC262, GSC231, GSC304 and GSC7-2. In our panel of GSCs, there were total of three cell lines with CDKN2A loss, RB phosphorylation and CDK4/6 overexpression (GSC262, GSC11 and GSC231). Our data showed that GSC262, GSC11, GSC231 (CDKN2A deletion, RB intact), GSC7-2 and GSC300 (CDKN2A WT, RB intact) were sensitive to CDK4/6 treatment (IC50  1M). CDK4/6 inhibitor treated GSCs showed G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased phospho-RB levels in GSC262 and GSC7-2 cells. We next determined whether CDK4/6 inhibition combined with radiation has additive or synergistic antitumor effect. A clonogenic assay demonstrated that neurosphere formation was significantly decreased by CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with radiation compared to either treatment in GSC262 (resistant to radiation treatment) or GSC7-2 (sensitive to radiation treatment) cell lines. The radiation resistant GSC (GSC262) treated with radiation and CDK4/6 inhibitor became sensitive to radiation therapy whereas radiation sensitive GSC (GSC7-2) had a significant decrease in colony formation compared to radiation alone. CDK4/6 combined with radiation increased -H2AX protein expression levels and decreased cyclin D1 protein expression in a time dependent manner compared to single drug treatment. These data indicate synergistic antitumor effects of CDK4/6 inhibition combined with radiation therapy in GSCs in vitro. Further investigation is ongoing to evaluate this combination therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Patient with glioblastoma (GBM) with unmethylated MGMT promoters derive limited benefit from temozolomide (TMZ) and have dismal outcome. Prioritizing the numerous available therapies and biomarkers for late stage testing requires an efficient clinical testing platform. INSIGhT (NCT02977780) is a biomarker-based, Bayesian adaptively randomized, multi-arm phase II platform screening trial for patients with newly diagnosed GBM and unmethylated MGMT promoters. Methods', ' INSIGhT compares experimental arms to a common control of standard concurrent TMZ and radiation therapy (RT) followed by adjuvant TMZ. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). Patients with newly diagnosed, unmethylated GBM that are IDH R132H mutation negative, and with genomic data available or who consent to whole exome sequencing through the ALLELE companion study for biomarker grouping are eligible. Two experimental arms consist of concurrent RT/TMZ followed by adjuvant neratinib (EGFR, HER2, and HER4 inhibitor) or abemaciclib CDK 4/6 inhibitor), respectively, in place of TMZ. The other experimental arm is CC-115 (TORC1/2 and DNA PK inhibitor), which replaces TMZ in both the concurrent and adjuvant phases. Biomarker groups include', ' EGFR + patients with EGFR amplification/mutation; PI3K + patients with PIK3CA mutation/amplification, PIK3R1 mutation, AKT3amplification, PIK3C2B > 1 copy gain, or PTEN dual loss; CDK', ' + patients with wild-type RB1 and CDK4 amplification, CDK6 amplification, or CDKN2A > 1 copy loss. Given the lack of pretrial biomarker data and the anticipated overlap of the groups, randomization will initially be equal. As the trial progresses, randomization probabilities will be adapted based on the Bayesian estimation of the probability of treatment impact on progression-free survival (PFS). These randomization probabilities can vary among the biomarker groups so predictive biomarkers will be identified and utilized if present. Treatment arms may drop due to low probability of treatment impact on OS, and new arms may be added. Experimental arms are compared only with control and should be thought of as discrete experimental questions, with INSIGhT being open to new investigators with proposed therapeutic hypotheses.
