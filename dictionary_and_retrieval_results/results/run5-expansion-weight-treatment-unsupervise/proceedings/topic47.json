        "Background":"['Targeting signal molecules with single agent monotherapy is met with limited or transient clinical benefits. Therefore, establishing effective rational combinatorial treatment strategies provides a better option for achieving improved clinical outcomes. The AKT/PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways have been identified as key compensatory signal transduction pathways in prostate cancer. We have used genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer to show the treatment efficacy of monotherapy with the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 and the MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886). We hypothesized that a rational combinatorial approach utilizing both of these inhibitors would improve treatment efficacy compared to single agent monotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the treatment effects of AZD5363 and selumetinib in preclinical models of prostate cancer. In vitro experiments were carried out using a panel of human prostate cancer cell lines, and mouse prostate cancer cell lines, derived from PTEN-deficient castration-nave prostate cancer (CNPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Treatments with AZD5363 and selumetinib demonstrated a synergistic combination effect in both human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines. We evaluated the antitumor effects in vivo by comparing the effects of AZD5363 and selumetinib alone or in combination in PTEN-deficient mice. Our studies show that combination therapy of AZD5363/selumetinib was well-tolerated by the mice and demonstrated significantly improved inhibition of tumor growth compared to single agent therapy. In the CNPC model, mice showed 16.7, 10.0 and 24.9% reductions in tumor burden after treatments with AZD5363, selumetinib and AZD5363/selumetinib, respectively (P<0.001). In the CRPC model, mice showed 15.8, 3.8 and 27.0% reductions in tumor burden after treatments with AZD5363, selumetinib and AZD5363/selumetinib, respectively (P<0.001). Target validation studies confirmed the inhibition of downstream targets. Overall, our findings suggest a potential role for targeting the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways with AZD5363 and selumetinib for treatment of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males after lung cancer in the USA. Under normal conditions, the essential role of androgen through the androgen receptor (AR) is to support prostate epithelial cell growth, functional differentiation and survival. However, the androgen and AR-mediated signaling pathways can also promote genesis, progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. Thus, androgen deprivation or abrogation of the AR signaling remains the first-line treatment for human advanced prostate cancer. Unfortunately, these prostate cancers develop resistance to these therapies and progress to androgen-independent or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with an average latency period of 18 months. Docetaxel chemotherapy and newly developed androgen synthesis blocker or AR signaling inhibitors have been demonstrated to be efficacious against CRPC. However, the median increase in survival was only four to five months. Thus, identification of molecular targets contributing to the initiation and progression of CRPC is a critical step to develop effective mechanism-based prostate cancer therapies. Recent studies provided compelling genetic evidence that Pten deletion, the most frequent genetic alterations identified in 70% of human advanced prostate cancers, promotes PCa progression to CRPC in preclinical mouse models. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Pten deletion-driven CRPC, we established an AR-positive prostate cancer cell line derived from an aggressive prostate tumor developed in a genetic mouse model carrying deletion of Pten only in prostate epithelium. Our initial characterization studies show that these cancer cells proliferated and grew well in an anchorage-independent growth assay either in the absence of androgen or genetic depletion of AR in vitro. In support of this notion, we found that these cancer cells formed tumors in female NOD/SCID IL2RG null mice. Interestingly, the tumors grow faster and larger in female NOD/SCID IL2RG null mice than in their male counterparts. These observations promoted us to further examine the role of estrogen in the development of CRPC. Genetic and pharmacologic studies suggested that estrogen, through its receptor alpha (ER)-FOXA1-mediated signaling pathway, increased cancer cell proliferation in vitro and promoted prostate tumor development in xenografts in female SCID mice. Furthermore, we found that these cancer cells display features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as characterized by the loss of E-cadherin and CK8 coupled with an increase in N-cadherin, vimentin, and twist expression. Collectively, our data suggest that (ER)-FOXA1-mediated signaling pathway and EMT play an important role in Pten deficiency-driven CRPC. Thus, targeting these signaling pathways might be a novel approach to complement current therapies of CRPC.Citation Format', ' Fengxia Wu, Lei Wang, Hua Xiong, Li-Ju Chang, Tao Lin, Junxuan Lu, Yibin Deng.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, other than skin cancer, in the United States. When the cancer enters into the metastatic castration resistant stage (mCRPC), few treatment options are currently available and the disease is considered incurable. The purpose of this study is to investigate a new, targeted therapy against prostate cancers, including mCRPC. Talazoparib is a novel PARP inhibitor with up to 100-fold higher potency and PARP affinity when compared to PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, veliparib, and rucaparib. Current literature suggests that PTEN mutants have high sensitivity to talazoparib. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is commonly lost in prostate cancers. A murine prostate cancer cell line, Myc-CaP, which has been modified to overexpress the oncogene Myc, was edited by the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock out the PTEN gene. Myc-CaP and Myc-CaP PTEN KO cells were treated with olaparib, an FDA approved, first generation PARP inhibitor, and talazoparib. Talazoparib decreased cell viability significantly more in PTEN KO cells versus PTEN wild-type (WT) cells. No such trend was observed when these cells were treated with olaparib. In addition, IC50 values in prostate cancer cell lines with heterozygous or homozygous deletion of PTEN were up to 20 times lower with the talazoparib treatment when compared to olaparib. Not only does this indicate that talazoparib is much more potent than olaparib, but also preferentially impairs cell growth in PTEN mutants. PTEN’s signal transduction prevents the phosphorylation of AKT, which is necessary for cell proliferation. When cells were treated with an AKT inhibitor, MK2206, alone or in combination with talazoparib, pAKT protein levels decreased, but the greatest effect was seen when MK2206 was used in combination with a low dose of talazoparib in the Myc-Cap cell line with wt PTEN. Western blot analysis showed that PTEN was upregulated following talazoparib treatment. These results indicate synergy of talazoparib and MK2206 in reducing the phosphorylation of AKT in a dose-dependent manner. Talazoparib is by far the most potent PARP inhibitor developed to date. With talazoparib potentially acting on prostate cancer with PTEN mutations, talazoparib treatment may expand current PARP inhibitor treatment in advanced prostate cancers and thereby elicit a response in as many as 80% of patients. Thus, talazoparib has vast therapeutic potential in prostate cancer.']",

        "Background":"[\"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer and a major cause of cancer related deaths in men in North America. The phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) is frequently inactivated in PCa. Approximately 40% of primary and 70% of metastatic PCa's have genomic alterations in the PI3K-signaling, mostly through the loss of PTEN. Majority of metastatic PCa associated with PTEN loss are treated with docetaxel; an FDA approved therapy for recurrent PCa. However, in PTEN null PCa docetaxel treatment enhances senescence and does not significantly impact tumor volume. These findings were further confirmed in PCa patients with decreased levels of PTEN. In order to understand the global impact of docetaxel in PTEN null PCa we performed an unbiased RNA-seq of prostate tissues harvested from docetaxel treated prostate specific PTEN null mice. Data analysis showed strong enrichment of chromatin modifying enzymes reactome, mainly PRC2 as one of the top ranked categories. Among them EZH2, an oncogenic methyltransferase was found to be significantly upregulated. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed statistically significant upregulation of EZH2 in docetaxel treated mice compared to vehicle control. EZH2 upregulation was independent of androgen levels as both androgen dependent and independent cells showed striking upregulation of EZH2 when treated with docetaxel. Next, we confirmed the nature of the upregulated EZH2 (catalytic or non-catalytic) by docetaxel. EZH2 methyltransferase activity assay data showed significant induction of methyltransferase activity by docetaxel in both androgen dependent and independent conditions and in PTEN null mouse tissues. Further, we measured other methyltransferase marks i.e. H3K27me1&2, H3K4me3, H3K9me3 in the presence of docetaxel and found only specific upregulation of H3K27me3, confirming upregulation of only catalytic EZH2 by docetaxel. These data suggested a need for co-targeting EZH2 during docetaxel treatment in PTEN null PCa conditions. In order to provide a proof-of-principle we performed a tumor xenograft study in nude mice implanted with PTEN null PC3 cells. Combination of DZNeP (an EZH2 inhibitor) and docetaxel significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to each agent alone. Results obtained from the xenograft studies prompted us to perform a preclinical study in prostate specific PTEN null mice. Data obtained from this study clearly showed a significant reduction in number of high grade lesions in PTEN null tumors in combination group when compared to either docetaxel or DZNeP treated mice. We also observed clearance of senescent cells and accumulation of CD8+ T cells and classical dendritic (CD8+ Clec9a+ positive) cells. Our data suggests the necessity of designing a combination therapy of targeting EZH2 during docetaxel treatment specifically, which will likely increase the efficacy of docetaxel in PTEN null PCa.\"]",

Establishing immunocompetent and clinically relevant models that predict treatment response is essential for the development of novel immunotherapies. To gain better insights into the preclinical evaluation of novel immunotherapeutic strategies, we used genetically engineered mouse models of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. We first analyzed the transcriptome in castration-naïve prostate tumors and the progression to castration-resistant disease. Comparative analyses were performed between age-matched normal prostate and PTEN-/- prostate tumor samples from castration-naïve mice and, at 4 weeks (castration-sensitive) and 10 weeks (castration-resistant) post-surgical castration. Pathway and gene-set enrichment analysis indicated that abnormal tumor immunity was strongly associated with the progression to castration resistance. Chemokine signaling, B cell receptor and T cell receptor signaling pathways were among the top dysregulated pathways, and gene signatures of suppressed tumor immunity were enriched in castration-resistant tumors. Higher expression patterns of the programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) were observed in castration-resistant tumors compared to castration-naïve tumors. We also characterized immune expression profiles in more aggressive tumors from PTEN/P53 double knockout (DKO) mice. PD-L1 was strongly expressed cancer cells, but a higher presence of PD-1+, CD45+ and F4/80+ stromal infiltrating immune cells in was observed in castration-resistant tumors. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with antibodies against mouse PD-L1 increased CD45+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in an early model of PTEN/P53-deficient castration-resistant prostate cancer. PTEN/P53-DKO mice with advanced castration-naïve prostate cancer tended to experienced longer overall survival after treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade compared to vehicle and isotype controls, median survival 23, 14 and 11 days, respectively, P=0.458. A higher number of CD45+ TILs was observed in tumors of mice receiving the anti-PD-L1 treatment. Interim analysis of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade on a model of advanced PTEN/P53-deficient castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has thus far shown that mice receiving treatment experience significantly longer survival (P=0.017, median survival not yet reached). Our findings show that castration-resistance promotes tumor immune suppression in mouse PTEN-deficient prostate cancer and suggest that this phenomenon can be reversed pharmacologically with anti-PD-L1 blockade. Thus, we provide preclinical evidence for immune checkpoint blockade as a potentially promising prostate cancer therapy.']",

Alternative splicing occurs as a common natural phenomenon and promotes diversity, however, cancer-related alternative splicing events have been shown to contribute to disease progression and promote therapeutic escape. In prostate cancer, key genes required for normal biological function are frequently alternatively spliced resulting in altered phenotypes. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting the alternative splicing machinery are being developed and tested. Here, characterized the conditional PTEN-deficient mouse model of prostate cancer to determine its relevancy as preclinical tool for the development and efficacy determination of novel therapeutic strategies targeting aberrant alternative splicing. For this, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip mouse transcriptome assay to perform comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of normal prostate tissue and PTEN-deficient castration-nave, castration-sensitive (4 weeks post-castration), and castration-resistant (10 weeks post-castration) prostate cancers. Clustering analysis revealed genes enriched with the functions involved in mRNA splicing and processing in mice with prostate tumors. Moreover, alternative splicing events were more prevalent in castration-sensitive tumors (>2.5-fold) compared to castration-nave and castration resistant tumors. Exon skipping (cassette exon), was the most common splicing event observed in all conditions. Additionally, alternative splicing was observed in several genes frequently associated with human prostate cancer including CD44, AR, p53, Bcl2l1 and Klf6 among others.

It can also promote survival by modulating tumor cell proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and immune response. However, recent preclinical data suggests that STAT3 may also act as a tumor suppressor in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of AZD1480, a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor, in genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer driven by the loss of PTEN and PTEN/P53.

Several human trials have been completed to date to assess the efficacy of BRB formulations for cancer prevention. However, the chemopreventive potential of BRBs against prostate cancer, the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of death among men in the United States, is yet to be reported. Among the murine models, PTEN-mutant mice develop tumors in situ that faithfully mimic the intratumor heterogeneity observed during the progression of human prostate cancer. Therefore, we utilized this clinically relevant PTEN-mutant mouse model to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of BRBs against prostate cancer.Genotyped 5-week-old male PTEN-mutant mice, randomly assigned to control and treatment groups (n = 12 mice/group), were fed AIN-93G diet (control) or AIN-93G diet supplemented with BRBs (5 or 10%) for 23 weeks. Age-matched non-transgenic mice (wild-type) served as experimental controls (n = 6). Animal weight and food consumption were measured during the treatment period, and the mice were euthanized at 28 weeks of age. Prostate tissues were harvested, weighed and fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological analysis. Histological, cell proliferation (Ki-67 staining) and apoptosis (TUNEL) analyses were performed to determine the chemopreventive potential of BRBs.PTEN-mutant mice fed control or BRB (5 or 10%) diets had steady body weight gain, 16 to 18 g during the 23-week treatment. BRB diets were well tolerated as none of the animals fed BRBs exhibited any observable toxicity. PTEN-mutant mice (control) had increased prostate weight (ave. = 248 mg) relative to wild-type mouse prostate (ave. = 90 mg), and 5 and 10% BRB diets significantly (p<0.01) decreased the prostate weights to ave. = 116 and 162 mg, respectively, compared to control. In addition, 5% BRBs significantly (p<0.05) reduced the prostate weights compared to 10% BRBs. Histological examination of dorsolateral prostate (DLP) revealed that 98% of PTEN-mutant mice fed control diet developed invasive adenocarcinomas, whereas both 5 and 10% BRB diets significantly reduced tumor incidence and the progression of PIN lesions to invasive adenocarcinomas by 64% (p<0.0001) and 43% (p<0.001), respectively. Interestingly, 5% BRBs appear to be more effective than 10% BRBs (p<0.01). Both 5 and 10% BRBs significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation rates and induced apoptosis, p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively. Furthermore, mice fed both 5 and 10% BRBs contained more normal appearing prostates (free from PIN lesions and adenocarcinomas), when compared to control mice (54 and 33% compared to 3%, respectively). In conclusion, our data indicate that BRBs may have significant potential for prostate cancer prevention and/or treatment.']",

This suggests that suppression of DHT with dutasteride may have a potential therapeutic effect on prostate cancer. In this study, we examined the antitumor effects of dutasteride in vivo using a preclinical model of prostate cancer that is based on the PSA-Cre mediated inactivation of PTEN. Our findings show that monotherapy with dutasteride significantly inhibited prostate tumor growth by approximately 25%. Furthermore, the combination of dutasteride with the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, improved tumor growth suppression compared to monotherapy with either drug. Treatment with dutasteride had a minimal effect on tumor cell proliferation; however, it significantly increased the apoptotic rate in tumors. Interestingly, treatment with dutasteride resulted in increased activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling and a reduction of STAT3 pathway activation. Moreover, increased activation of MAPK, which occurs after treatment with mTOR inhibitors, was effectively reduced with the co-administration of dutasteride.

We have shown in human tumor xenografts that the combination of IGF-IR inhibition with the human mab IMC-A12 in combination with androgen deprivation (ADT) was more efficacious than ADT alone. In a subsequent neoadjuvant study with IMC-A12, responses were at least as efficacious in hi-grade disease (Gleason 7 (4+3), 8, and 9) when compared to ADT alone. In order to determine predictors of response to IMC-A12 plus ADT (surgical castration) in human prostate cancer, we examined the response of 21 human prostate cancer xenografts (LuCaP series) grown in SCID mice for responses to castration, IMC-A12 40mg/kg ip 3x a week for four weeks, or castration followed by four weeks of IMC-A12. At the end of the IMC-A12 treatment animals were followed until tumor recurrence. When all animals were completed tumor growth was analyzed. The main differences in growth rates, as expected based on previous studies, occurred in mice receiving IMC-A12 plus castration compared to castration alone. Responses were segregated into three groups', ' Major Response - slope of tumor growth was negative in the IMC-A12 + Castration group compared to castration alone; Moderate Response - slope of combined treatment is flat and castration alone is positive; No-response - no differences in slope between castration and castration plus IMC-A12. We then examined the association of response to IMC-A12 to potential effectors of IGF-IR expression and signaling in the prostate including AR and AR splice variants and PTEN status. Tumor transcript profiles were generated on all xenografts prior to treatment and gene sets predictive of response determined. None of the PTEN null tumors showed a strong response to IMC-A12 and all PTEN null tumors expressed the AR-splice variant ARv567es. Of the 3 xenografts with one copy of PTEN, non- or partial responders either expressed no AR (neuroendocrine tumor) or expressed ARv567es. Of xenografts with 2 or more copies of PTEN, non- or moderate responders expressed AR-variants. Finally, transcript profiles provided a gene signature that was highly predictive of response to IMC-A12. These data indicate that PTEN insufficiency or the presence of an AR-splice variant that cannot increase IGF-IR via non-genomic activity are associated with resistance to IMC-A12. Further, a gene signature has been developed from the 21 xenografts that is predictive of response to IMC-A12 and castration.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Chemokines are a family of cytokines known to regulate the migration of cells. The chemokine CXCL12, also known as SDF-1, and its receptor CXCR4 are associated with prostate cancer bone metastasis. The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a critical regulator of growth factors and inhibitor of PI3K. Loss of PTEN is frequently observed in cancer, resulting in the deregulation of cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Previous studies have found that PTEN is lost or mutated in 30-80% of primary prostate cancer, and 50% of prostate cancer bone metastases. In mouse models of prostate cancer, it has been shown that loss of PTEN is critical for tumor initiation, and the level of PTEN expression is inversely associated with prostate tumorigenesis. Murine epithelial cells from PTEN-deficient prostate tumors also display increased expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12. We hypothesize that loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt, frequent occurrences in prostate cancer, regulate the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in prostate cancer progression.Methods', ' Prostate-specific deletion of floxed exon 5 of PTEN was achieved by Cre recombinase expressed under the control of an androgen-responsive probasin promoter. Stable cell lines were developed from PTEN+/+, PTEN+/, and PTEN/ murine prostate epithelial cells isolated from prostates of corresponding mice at 8 weeks of age. PTEN status in these cell lines was confirmed by genotyping and immunoblot analyses. Human prostate cancer cell lines BPH-1, C4-2B, PC3, and DU145 were also utilized. Gene expression and invasion were analyzed in the presence or absence of Akt inhibitor. Additionally, DU145 with overexpressed HA-tagged Akt1 was also utilized in a subcutaneous injection model.Results', ' Loss of PTEN resulted in increased expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12, suggesting that loss of PTEN may play a key role in the regulation of these chemokines in prostate cancer. Upon treatment of PTEN-null cells with Akt inhibitor, the induction of CXCL12/CXCR4 was reversed, further demonstrating the role of the PTEN regulated pathway in the expression of these genes. Akt inhibition also resulted in decreased invasion in response to CXCL12. Overexpression of Akt1 in DU145 resulted increased CXCR4 expression, as well as increased proliferation and cell cycle progression. Subcutaneous injection of these cells also resulted in increased tumor growth as compared to neo controls.Conclusions', ' These results suggest the basis for activation of CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 in prostate cancer driven by the loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt.']",

Here we characterize Pten loss induced cellular senescence (PICS) as a novel type of senescence. Additionally, we show that compounds which target PTEN and MDM-2 can be used alone or in combination to potentiate the senescence pathway in tumors of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) and human xenografts models. Methods', ' Cell growth inhibition, western blot analysis and senescence assay (SA) were performed on LnCAP, MDA-PCa2b and PC3 cancer cell lines.

In vivo evaluation of V and N were done both in Pten null prostate conditional mice (Ptenpc-/-) and human xenograft models. Results', ' PICS, represents a distinct type of senescence response that can be targeted for cancer therapy.

We also find that PICS is associated with enhanced mTOR-dependent p53 translation. In agreement with these mechanistic findings, N dramatically potentiate senescence and strongly inhibits tumorigenesis in Ptenpc-/- mice. Combination of V and N acts synergistically in inducing senescence in vitro and reducing cell growth.

The antitumor effects of AZD5363, a pan AKT inhibitor, and AZD1208, a highly potent Pim kinase inhibitor, were investigated as monotherapy or in combination on mice harboring castration-naïve prostate tumors and mice that developed castration-resistant disease. Mice were randomized treated for four weeks. Safety and tolerability was assessed by bodyweight changes. Antitumor activity was determined by differences in tumor burden, proliferation and apoptosis and histology. Molecular activity was assessed by examining the phosphorylation of common substrates by western blot analysis. Treatments were well-tolerated and no significant differences in bodyweight changes were observed. In castration-naïve prostate tumors, treatments with AZD5363, AZD1208 and AZD5363/AZD1208 resulted in 11.9%, 13.5% and 36.9% reductions of tumor burden compared to vehicle treated controls, respectively, P<0.001. The treatment combination of AZD5363/AZD1208 demonstrated significant antitumor activity compared to monotherapy, P<0.001. In the castration-resistant tumors, treatments with AZD5363, AZD1208 and AZD5363/AZD1208 resulted in 21%, 9.5% and 27% reductions of tumor burden compared to vehicle treated controls, respectively, P<0.004. Although the differences in in tumor burden were not statistically between monotherapy and combination therapy, a notable degree of tumor gland regression was observed in tumors treated with AZD5363/AZD1208. Overall, combination therapy showed a synergistic effect by inhibited or impaired phosphorylation of PRAS40, eIF4B and BAD in both castration-naïve and castration-resistant tumor models. Inhibition of both pathways enhanced the reduction of tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Overall, our findings provide in vivo data to support redundancy between AKT/Pim survival pathways and suggest that a therapeutic approach of combined AKT/Pim kinase inhibition may be possible therapeutic approach for AKT-driven prostate cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Resistance to androgen deprivation therapies is characterized by the persistent activation of the androgen receptor (AR). Traditional approaches for the development of novel androgen deprivation therapies have focused on inhibition of AR activity by blocking the production or binding of androgens to the AR. These novel treatment strategies have shown improvements, however, patients still develop castration-resistant disease. Continued AR activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) may be the result of ligand dependent or ligand independent mechanisms. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) have the ability to block specific genes inhibiting the associated proteins thus providing an alternate treatment strategy for CRPC. Here, we investigated the in vivo antitumor effects of a generation 2.5 ASO targeting the mouse AR in a PTEN-deficient mouse model of prostate cancer. Pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated strong inhibition of target RNA by the AR-ASO in prostate tumor tissues. The AR-ASO also exhibited strong suppression of AR protein levels in prostate tumors as demonstrated by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed reduced levels of AR expression and transcriptional activity in tumor tissue. Furthermore, AR was also inhibited in normal tissues of the accessory sex glands. The treatment efficacy of the AR-ASO was evaluated in pharmacological intervention trials in mice with castration-nave prostate cancer (CNPC) and CRPC. Treatments effects in CNPC were also compared to androgen deprivation by surgical castration. Compared to saline treated controls, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by the AR-ASO (34%) and was comparable to that of surgical castration (38%). In the CRPC model, significant suppression of tumor growth (10% vs control) was also observed in mice treated with the AR-ASO. Furthermore, strong inhibition of AR expression and activity was observed in AR-ASO-treated mice harboring either CNPC or CRPC, but not in mice treated with surgical castration. Gene expression profiling using the Fluidigm Biomark platform revealed that 40 AR-dependent target genes were significantly altered in CNPC after treatment with the AR-ASO; 34 of these genes were also significantly changed following castration. A decrease of ERK phosphorylation in was observed in AR-ASO-treated mice in both CNPC and CRPC intervention models and was associated with decreased protein levels of AR. These findings demonstrate that treatment with generation 2.5 AR-ASO is effective against preclinical mouse models of prostate cancer and may provide a promising approach to overcoming treatment resistance of CRPC.']",

Rad51 is an essential protein in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA double strand breaks. Previous studies with non metastatic prostate cancer (mCaP) cells have reported low Rad51 levels in cells with loss of PTEN or under hypoxia, which then led to their sensitivity to PARPi. Given intra tumor hypoxia and loss of PTEN is common in mCaP, we test PAPRi, ABT888 and DNA damaging topoisomerase I inhibitor, CPT11, either alone or in combination in mCaP preclinical models. Methods', '  mCaP cell lines with functional PTEN (DU145) and loss of PTEN (PC3) were grew under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (0.2% O2). DNA damage, HRR, apoptosis were assessed with comet assay, western blot, immunofluorescence and flowcytometry. The regulation of RAD51 was studied with quantitative RT-PCR and RAD51 promoter reporter assay. PC3 xenograft was used for in vivo study.  Results', '  Despite of its low levels of expression under hypoxia, up regulation of Rad51 was observed soon after treating hypoxic PC3 and Du145 cells with ABT888 or SN38, an active metabolite of CPT11. Such Rad51 up regulation led to less DNA damage and apoptosis under hypoxia compared to normoxia. Inhibiting RAD51 expression with siRNA overcame PC3 and Du145s resistance to SN38. Furthermore, ABT888 enhanced the activities of SN38 as detected by clonogenic assay and flowcytometry under both normoxia and hypoxia. Consistent with the in vitro data, ABT888 by itself had limited anti-tumor activities despite the loss of PTEN in PC3 xenografts. The anti-tumor activity of single agent CPT11 was significantly improved with the ABT888 and CPT11 combination (P<0.008).  Conclusions', '  neither loss of PTEN nor hypoxia sensitized mCaP cells to PARPi or DNA damaging drugs. Such resistance under hypoxia was at least partly due to up regulation of Rad51. Combining ABT888 with CPT11 overcame the resistance to CPT11 under hypoxia and enhanced its anti-tumor activities both in vitro and in vivo.']",

PTEN is a well-characterized tumor suppressor gene that is lost or mutated in many human cancers including ~50% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Reintroduction of functional PTEN for mCRPC treatment has proven difficult. Methods', ' PTEN mRNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription method and modified with ARCA capping and enzymatic polyadenylation, and then substituted with Pseudo-UTP, 5-Methyl-CTP. A robust self-assembly approach was employed to prepare PTEN mRNA nanoparticles (NPs) using cationic lipid-like compound G0-C14 and PLGA polymer coated with lipid-PEG shell. PTEN expression in tumors and PI3K-AKT pathway were confirmed by IHC and western blot, respectively. Apoptosis was checked by flow cytometry and Tunel assays. In vivo toxicity was studied by hematologic and histologic tests, and immune response. Results', ' We successfully restored PTEN mRNA to PTEN-null prostate cancer (PCa) cells via systemic delivery of mRNA NPs. These mRNA NPs are stable in serum, demonstrate minimal toxicity, and provide highly effective transfection in PCa cells (substantially higher HA-PTEN expression than plasmid PTEN transfection) and PCa xenograft tumors, leading to ~85% inhibition of tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also confirm mRNA NP-mediated systemic restoration of PTEN function in PTEN-null PCa and delineate its tumor suppression through inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway and enhancement of apoptosis. Conclusions', ' The work provides proof of principle for the systemic reintroduction of mRNA-based tumor suppressor genes to tumors in vivo. Because PTEN loss is frequent in late-stage PCa, this approach may have feasibility in this patient population. Considering the strong potential of mRNA therapy and the lack of systemic studies of in vivo mRNA transfection of tumors, this study sheds light on the useful application of NP-mediated mRNA delivery for validating tumor suppressors (e.g., PTEN) as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment where loss of a tumor suppressor contributes to the underlying genetic mechanism of cancer.']",

PCas with PTEN deletion along with ERG have altered clinical behavior. We developed a strategy to establish PCa xenografts with tissue taken directly from men and implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice. After its growth, the tumor is harvested and sequentially passaged over 4 or 5 mice. We have established 62 PCa xenografts since the program's inception. These xenografts, which are often developed while the donor PCa patient is alive, have proven valuable for testing drugs and have led to initiation of a promising clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov\", ' NCT00831792). In the study reported here we systematically characterized 51/62 xenografts for the presence of known PCa markers by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The PCa xenografts were derived from PCas in the prostate or direct extensions to adjacent organs (21) or from metastases to bone (4), lymph node (3), liver (6), thyroid (1), testis (1), adrenal gland (2), brain (3), and unusual sites (skin, chest wall, soft tissue) (4) or ascites (3), and pleural effusions (3). 81% of xenografts derived from prostatic adenocarcinomas were AR positive (27/33); 16 were small-cell, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas or ductal adenocarcinomas and did not express AR. One sarcomatoid and 1 ductal adenocarcinoma expressed AR; 77% of evaluable tumors had a deletion in PTEN (31/40); 48% of AR-positive tumors expressed recurrent gene fusions (eg, ERG, ETV1, ETV5) (13/27). Together, these results in this cohort_AR and recurrent gene fusion expression and PTEN deletion_nicely correlate with findings in human PCa. We next assessed whether PCa xenografts maintained histopathologic and molecular fidelity with the human tumor of origin in selected cases (n=16). Histopathologic pattern and recurrent gene fusion expression were the same in the paired human and mouse tissue. The AR and PTEN status were the same in most paired human and mouse samples. In 4 cases, AR expression was lost or PTEN deleted in the PCa xenograft, suggesting that selection for more aggressive genotypes may occur during xenograft development and that PCa xenografts develop by selecting cells drivers of cancer progression. In conclusion, we have developed a protocol for xenograft development that has fidelity with human PCa. This approach has provided a repository of clinically annotated samples that can be linked prospectively to clinical progression/response to therapy and thus will help identify therapy responders.']",

PTEN loss of function results in activation of Akt and downstream signaling pathways, and has been associated with numerous cancers, most commonly endometrial cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma and prostate cancer. PTEN loss can be a result of multiple different aberrations which include mutations in the coding region leading to frame-shift or stop codons, genomic deletions as well as promoter methylation leading to loss of PTEN protein. Determination of PTEN status, both at the DNA and protein levels, may be important for clinical decision-making because loss of PTEN is associated with resistance to various targeted therapies, while inactivating mutations may confer sensitivity to therapeutics targeting PI3K pathway members. We have developed Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) assays to assess PTEN mutation status in a set of FFPE patient specimens.Methods', ' Our Sanger sequencing assay for PTEN was developed to detect known hotspot mutations in exons 5-8, which occur in the majority of PTEN mutations reported in the COSMIC database.

These 2 specimens were further analyzed by CISH to determine copy number. Of the 13 specimens reported as mutant by sequencing, IHC protein expression results indicated that 6 were PTEN positive and 7 were PTEN negative, underscoring the observation that exon 5-8 mutation status alone is not sufficient to predict PTEN expression levels. Data on CISH analysis of the specimen that was hemizygous mutant by sequencing will be reported to confirm the copy loss.Conclusion', ' The data suggest that additional mutations outside the exon 5-8 region as well as promoter methylation may result in loss of PTEN protein, and that accurate clinical assessment of PTEN mutation and protein expression status in FFPE tissues requires complimentary methods including Sanger sequencing, IHC and CISH methodologies.']",

        "Background":"['Androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptor signaling play opposing roles in prostate tumorigenesis', ' in prostate AR acts as an oncogene and GR is a tumor suppressor. Here we explored a novel strategy of simultaneous inhibition of AR and activation of GR signaling for prostate cancer treatment using non-steroidal AR/GR modulator Compound A (CpdA) in combination with proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (BZ). We and others found that CpdA acts as anti-inflammatory anti-androgen. It inhibits basal and DHT-induced AR activity; does not induce GR dimerization and transactivation but induces GR transrepression via inhibition of several transcription factors, including NF-kB, AP-1, and others. We also previously reported that CpdA has high anti-PC potential (Yemelyanov et al., 2008). It is known that GR and AR are controlled by proteasomal degradation. Here we show that prolonged exposure of prostate carcinoma (PCa) cells PC3 (AR-/GR+), DU145 (AR-/GR+), LNCaP (AR+/GR-), and LNCaP-GR (AR+/GR+), to BZ caused AR degradation and GR accumulation. BZ enhanced CpdA ability to inhibit AR and to augment GR transrepression. We also found that CpdA+BZ cooperatively inhibited PCa cell growth and survival and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) as was indicated by up-regulation of BIP/HSPA5, ATF2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and by induction of downstream pro-apoptotic ERS effector CHOP/GADD153. In contrast, glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetate and androgen DHT down-regulated cytoplasmic and nuclear CHOP, pointing to the ability of the androgens and glucocorticoids to counteract ERS in PC cells. Using ChIP we showed that BIP/HSPA5 and CHOP regulation was due to effects of CpdA and CpdA+BZ on GR loading on their promoters. Since CHOP/GADD153 was differentially activated by CpdA and BZ+CpdA via GR, we analyzed its role in anti-cancer effect of CpdA+BZ. The cooperative CpdA+BZ growth suppression and induction of apoptosis were significantly stronger in LNCaP-GR-CHOP compared to LNCaP-GR cells with low endogenous CHOP expression. Growth suppression and apoptosis induction by CpdA+BZ were drastically diminished in LNCaP-GR-shCHOP cells with depleted endogenous CHOP. Finally, we found that AR and GR are abundant in advanced PCa from patients treated by androgen ablation and/or chemotherapy', ' 56% of carcinomas from treated patients expressed both receptors, and the other 27% expressed either GR or AR.

Treating CRPC with second generation androgen -ablation based therapies like enzalutamide and abiraterone exhibit only a short window of therapeutic benefit resulting in chemoresistance. Hence, there is an immediate need for identification of novel targets to eradicate CRPC effectively. We and others have reported targeting AKT activation could efficiently suppress the growth of CRPC cells; in fact a number of clinical trials have shown some promise that AKT could be an attractive target for CRPC. In fact, clinical studies from our lab have suggested that AKT activation predominantly occurs in Gleason stage specific manner suggesting identification of novel drugs to inhibit AKT activation is imperative. Our earlier finding suggests that Withaferin-A (WA), an herbal molecule effectively inhibits the growth of CRPC cells by downregulating AKT activation and its downstream pro-survival events. Present study investigated whether oral administration of WA may inhibit tumor development in Pten conditional knockout mice [(Pten-loxp/loxp', 'PB-Cre4+) (Pten-KO)] which will be a unique and appropriate preclinical model to study the AKT driven prostate tumor. Oral administration of WA for 45 weeks effectively prevented the tumor growth without any significant signs of toxicity to organs in Pten-KO mice. Vehicle and WA (5mg/kg body weight) were orally given up to 45 weeks. Gross pathological studies suggested a significant inhibition of growth and micro metastasis in WA-treated mice as compared to the vehicle treated mice. On microscopic examination of the prostatic tissue, we found that the WA-treated tumors showed more necrosis than the control group and some of the tumors were more differentiated than the controls in the same group. All the organs were completely submitted for histological evaluation. None of the WA-treated mice organs showed any metastatic lesion on the other hand, we found discrete metastasis to lungs in the control tumors. Our ongoing immunohistochemistry analysis may corroborate our in vitro findings that down regulation of AKT and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as -catenin, snail, and vimentin in WA treated tumors as compared to the control mice.

Chemopreventive and anticancer effects of Res may be exerted in part by modulating various components of the epigenetic machinery. We recently demonstrated that Res represses nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) co-repressor complex by inhibiting metastasis associated protein 1/ histone deacetylase 1 (MTA1/HDAC1) subunit, which plays an essential role in governing deacetylation of histone and non-histone proteins. Since Res-induced upregulation of tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is concomitant with MTA1-downregulation, we hypothesized that in the absence of Res MTA1 works in cooperation with PI3K/Akt survival pathways. We further hypothesized that Res-induced restoration of PTEN expression and function may occur by dual mechanism through MTA1/HDAC inhibition and regulation of miRNA network. Our data indicate that shRNA-mediated MTA1 knockdown in Du145 cells (wt PTEN) enhances acetylation of PTEN, and that HDAC inhibitor trichostatin (TSA) further potentiates PTEN acetylation. We also showed that Res treatment simultaneously decreases MTA1 and pAkt levels in LNCaP cells, the effect which is enhanced in combination with PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and BEZ235. To further understand Res-induced MTA1-mediated epigenetic alterations, we analyzed MTA1-associated and Res-induced microRNA (miRNA, miR) changes in LNCaP cells expressing and silenced for MTA1 (shMTA1). Interestingly, Res downregulated miRs (oncomiRs) included members of miR17-92 cluster (miRs-17, 20a, 20b) and miRs 106a and 106b which target PTEN. These findings were further confirmed by real time PCR analysis which showed that Res specifically down-regulated these miRNAs in PCa cells (LNCaP and Du145) but not in normal prostate cell line RWPE-1. Direct interaction of miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b with PTEN 3UTR were analyzed in the presence and absence of Res using pmiRGLO luciferase reporter.

Chi-square or Fisher exact test was used to determine the association between the categorical variables using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Distribution of positive cells did not differ among lesions. PCa and PIA showed more samples with weak intensity for ATM when compared to normal prostatic tissue and BPH (PCa', ' p=0,032 and PIA', ' p=0,025). Benign prostatic hyperplasia and normal samples presented intense PTEN immunostaining than PCa (p=0,021) and PIA (p=0,0013).

        "Background":"['Autophagy (also referred to as macroautophagy) is a self-catabolic process that maintains intracellular homeostasis and prolongs cell survival by the autophagosomic-lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic contents during metabolic stress or nutrient starvation. Inactivation of PTEN tumor suppressor function is a common characteristic of human prostate cancer that leads to the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and has emerged as promising candidate for targeted therapies. mTOR is one of the upstream regulators of autophagy, therefore, inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis putatively stimulates autophagy. However, the role of autophagy in cancer is complex, acting both as a tumor suppressor and promoter, and its role in prostate tumorigenesis remains to be defined. Here we demonstrate that prostate cancer is dependent on autophagy for its growth and progression through the use genetically modified mouse models of prostate cancer.We had previously reported a conditional knockout mouse model in which homozygous deletion of PTEN lead to the stage-specific development of invasive adenocarcinoma. Characterization of tumors from the mice showed that although autophagy was suppressed early in tumor development, tumors eventually restored autophagic function despite increased PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. To determine the effect of defective autophagy on prostate cancer progression, we generated prostate-specific conditional double knockout mice harboring both inactivated PTEN and ATG7, a key regulator for the formation of autophagosomes. Prostate-specific inactivation of ATG7 function alone did not result in changes to the development or function of the prostate gland. Prostate-specific inactivation of both PTEN and ATG7 led to the early development of prostate adenocarcinoma similar to homozygous PTEN-mutant mice. However, prostate tumors failed to progress and showed regression. Our data suggests that impaired autophagy can be induced independent of mTOR and defective autophagy contributes to suppress tumor progression. Thus, our findings support the role of autophagy as a therapeutic target for advance prostate cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Mutations of multiple tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN and p53, have been proposed to play important roles in the development of prostate cancer. Loss of one allele of PTEN occurs in 70-80% of human primary prostate tumors and homozygous inactivation of PTEN is associated with advanced disease. Similarly, p53 is found completely lost or mutated almost exclusively in advanced human prostate cancer. Thus, selective killing of prostate cancer cells harboring mutations of PTEN and p53 may prove to be a promising strategy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The Warburg effect of aerobic glycolysis has now been generally accepted as a key metabolic hallmark of cancer. In this study, we investigated the molecular target leading to the Warburg effect in the growth and aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells harboring inactivation of PTEN and p53 and delineated the underlying mechanism. We identified that expression of hexokinase II (HK2), an enzyme involved in the first step of glycolysis, is preferentially elevated in human prostate cancer cells bearing mutations of both PTEN and p53 (PC3). Functional studies demonstrated that HK2 expression is crucial for the Warburg effect in PC3 cells and knockdown of HK2 inhibits tumor growth in PC3 xenograft mouse model. These novel findings prompted us to test whether 2-de-oxyglucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of HK2, could potentially suppress prostate cancer growth by targeting the Warburg effect. We found that an induction of AMPK-dependent autophagy prevents cancer cells from apoptosis upon 2-DG treatment, thereby limiting therapeutic efficacy on prostate cancer in vivo. Consistent with cell survival function of autophagy, its inhibition by chloroquine (a small molecule inhibitor of autophagy) or individual knockdown of the essential genes involved in autophagy (Atg5, Atg7, Beclin1, and ULK1) induced massive cell death when combined with 2-DG. This cell death can be rescued by overexpression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or downregulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in PC3. More importantly, we demonstrated that combination of chloroquine and 2-DG could specifically kill prostate cancer cells, leaving normal prostate epithelial cells untouched. This specificity is due to the preferential induction of HK2 through the activated Rictor-AKT-mTOR pathway in cancer cells. Finally, combination of chloroquine and 2-DG caused synthetic lethality in prostate cancer cells and effectively suppressed tumor growth in PC3 xenograft mouse model. Towards therapeutic translation, we have observed that expression of HK2 by staining primary human prostate tumor samples with HK2 antibodies correlated with the stages of prostate cancer. Given our findings, we therefore propose that targeting the Warburg effect and autophagy pathways may serve as an effective and selective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer, in particular those with PTEN and p53 mutations.']",

        "Background":"['Interleukin-6 or IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine which is implicated in the regulation of immune response, but is also involved in regulating the growth of various malignant tumors. Mounting evidence suggests that IL-6 contributes to prostate cancer progression. Activated IL-6 has been shown to be elevated in the sera from patients with metastatic prostate cancer and it appears that the prostate tissue itself is a source of IL-6 and its receptor. Experimental data suggests that the IL-6/IL-6R signaling axis is an autocrine and paracrine growth factor in androgen independent prostate cancer cell lines and can activate a variety of signal transduction cascades, some of which may activate androgen receptor activity. In the present study we examined the role of IL6-induced Stat3 activation in the development and progression of prostate cancer and its possible role as a target for the treatment of prostate cancer using the prostate-specific conditional targeting PTEN knockout mouse model. In PTEN-mutant mice, elevated levels of IL6/IL-6R correlated with increased cellular proliferation in non-castrate and castrate prostate cancer (CRPC). Similar to human prostate cancer, mice with CPRC showed elevated levels of IL-6 and IL6-R in both serum and prostate tissue. To establish a therapeutic role for IL6/IL6R inhibition, we conducted a series of pharmacodynamic studies using an anti-mouse IL-6R antibody (MR-16) in tumor bearing homozygous PTEN-mutant mice. Our data shows that STAT3 activation was inhibited in a dose dependent manner during acute IL6-R blockade. Inhibition of STAT3 activity after chronic IL-6R blockade was transient. However, at day 45 of treatment, tumor cell proliferation was inhibited and apoptosis was induced. These findings show that this mouse model is relevant for the study of Stat3 signaling and tumor progression and inhibition of Stat3 transcriptional activation by upstream signal blockade may be a promising approach for molecularly targeted therapeutic strategies in human prostate cancer. Thus this study will serve as the foundation for future drug intervention studies designed to assess the efficacy of targeting the JAK/STAT signal pathway using targeted monotherapy and combination drug therapy models.']",

        "Background":"['Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzyme plays a key role in the cellular machinery responsible for DNA damage repair. Although inhibition of this enzyme using a pharmacological inhibitor is postulated to enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy, this has not been profoundly studied in lung cancer. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) is a tumor-suppressor gene deactivating PI3K downstream of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling. Approximately 2% to 9% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are considered to have PTEN loss, and a recurrent gross-mutation of the PTEN gene is identified in lung cancer with deficient DNA double-strand break repair. We hypothesize that there is a cellular threshold for error-free DNA-repair in lung cancer cells and that the absence of PTEN can sensitize these cells to a concurrent treatment of a DNA-damaging agent (cisplatin) and a PARP inhibitor (olaparib). To investigate the effect of olaparib and cisplatin on PTEN deficient lung tumors, two EGFR mutant (deletion in exon19) NSCLC cell lines, PC-9 (PTEN wild type) and NCI-H1650 (PTEN loss) were used. Two additional cell lines with PTEN loss, prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) and glioblastoma cell line (U-87MG) were also examined. We transfected intact PTEN gene into H1650 cells and knocked down PTEN expression in the PC-9 cells using shRNA. Antiproliferative activity was determined by MTT assay in terms of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Olaparib alone was not effective for H1650 cells and other PTEN-deficient cells. IC50 values ranged from 6 to 40 M for olaparib and from 0.2 to 2 M for cisplatin. Combination of cisplatin with olaparib showed a synergistic effect in vitro according to the combination index (CI). CIs were 0.23, 0.20, 0.57 and 0.29 when concentration ratios of cisplatin and olaparib were designed to be molar ratios of 1', '1, 1', '2, 1', '3 and 1', '5, respectively. Restoration of PTEN in the H1650 cells decreased sensitivity to olaparib and cisplatin (CI >1). Ablation of PTEN in PC-9 cells increased sensitivity to olaparib and cisplatin (CI <1). We also examined the effectiveness of the cisplatin (5 mg/kg/week) and olaparib (50 mg/kg/day) in a xenograft model using H1650 cells. The combination of cisplatin with olaparib was more effective than each agent individually. This effect was not observed in a xenograft model using PTEN transfected H1650 cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that PTEN-deficiency caused a reduction in radiation-induced nuclear RAD51 focus formation and activation of Chk1 S345. Thus, genetic inactivation of PTEN led to suppression of DNA repair. The combination of cisplatin with olaparib in PTEN deficient lung tumors should be further pursued.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer remains the second-leading cause of cancer death in men. The first line treatment for advanced prostate cancer is hormone deprivation therapy (ADT), which although it is initially effective, usually leads to progression to more aggressive and often lethal castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Nonetheless, CRPC remains dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling through various mechanisms. Therefore, drugs that target androgen synthesis or AR signaling, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, have been employed as second line therapy. Despite the fact that both drugs improve the overall survival for CRPC patients, neither of them is curative, suggesting intrinsic or acquired resistance. Here we have focused on elucidating resistance mechanisms for abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis, using preclinical analyses of relevant genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs).Given the high frequency of co-alteration in PTEN and p53 in mCRPC, we generated conditional GEMMs based on deletion of either PTEN alone or PTEN plus p53 to obtain the NP and NPp53 GEMMs, respectively. Both NP and NPp53 mice develop CRPC, and cross-species gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggests that they have molecular programs that are well-conserved with human CRPC. In preclinical studies, we find that the NP mice are highly responsive to tumor inhibition by abiraterone, whereas the NPp53 mice do not respond. In fact, the NPp53 mice display a marked acceleration of tumor progression following abiraterone treatment. The disparate phenotypic responses of the NP and NPp53 mice to abiraterone are evident by analyses of their tumor histology, immunohistochemical staining, as well as the change in tumor volume by MRI imaging. We further validated the results in a genetically modified human prostate cancer cell line. In particular, a xenograft model based on 22RV1 cells that are depleted for both PTEN and p53 also displayed an acceleration of the tumor phenotype following abiraterone treatment. Notably, expression profiling of the abiraterone- or vehicle-treated responder NP tumors versus non-responder NPp53 tumors identified a unique set of cancer driver genes that are enriched for genes found in human neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). These findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, which demonstrated a significant increase in synaptophysin-expressing cells in CRPC in the NPp53 mice but not the NP mice.Our findings suggest that loss of p53 in the context of PTEN deletion promotes resistance to abiraterone while CRPC in the NPp53 mice partially resemble human NEPC. Given the high prevalence of co-alteration of PTEN and p53 in advanced human mCRPC, and observed occurrence of treatment induced NEPC-like phenotypes observed following treatment with AR targeting agents in patients, our finding suggest that abiraterone may not be suitable for patients with alterations in both PTEN and p53.']",

Mice (4 wks old) were divided into three groups (Control (n=40), PL (200 ppm) (n=20), and PL (500 ppm) (n=40). Mice were sacrificed at 15 and 30 wks of age. To determine the prostate tumor volume, we carried out micro-PET/CT analysis of control and PL treated groups mice at 30 wks using a tumor selective radiopharmaceutical agent 124I-NM404. PL treatment (200 and 500 ppm) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease (p<0.01) in prostate tumor volume. PL treatment also resulted in a significant (P<0.001) decrease in weights of prostate tumors and urogenital apparatus at 15 and 30 wks. Histopathological analyses revealed inhibition of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to invasive adenocarcinoma at 15 and 30 wks. PL treated mice also showed a significant (P<0.01) inhibition of small invasive adenocarcinoma with cystic change at 30 wks. To determine the effects of PL in castrated resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we castrated 26 Pten-KO mice at 10 wks and divided into 2 groups. PL treatment was started one wk after castration and continued until 50 wks. At 50 wks, castrated control Pten-KO mice illustrated atrophy of prostate tumors. PL treatment (500 ppm) further resulted in a significant decrease of prostate tumors weight of castrated Pten-KO mice. Histopathological analysis of PL treated mice prostate tumors showed significant decrease of both invasive adenocarcinoma and cystic change. Biochemical analyses of Pten-KO mice prostate tumors elicited a constitutive activation of AKT, protein kinase C epsilon (PKC), signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) and increased COX2 expression compared to wild type mice. PL treatment resulted in decreased expression of PKC, Stat3 and COX2 compared to control mice. We also observed that PL targets tumor associated macrophages (TAM) in prostate tumors. Prostate tumors of PL treated mice showed an increased infiltration of M1 macrophages and inhibition of M2 macrophages, as analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of F4/80, iNOS and L-arginase. PL treatment also inhibited the expression of vimentin and slug, the markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate tumors. In summary, the results indicate that dietary PL inhibits growth of both primary and CRPC, which was accompanied inhibition of EMT and modulation of tumor microenvironment.

Linking molecular background to clinical behaviour, i.e. tumour progression and response to therapy has not yet been fully established. This is in large measure due to a paucity of well-annotated patient cohorts, which cover the evolution from localized, hormone nave to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Deletions in the gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 1 (CHD1) are among the most frequent genomic alterations in prostate cancer. CHD1 is a ATPase-dependent helicase mediating a variety of biological processes by modifying chromatin structure. In hormone sensitive prostate cancer, loss of CHD1 has been associated with increased genomic instability and aggressiveness. Here we monitor CHD1 status during the progression from hormone sensitive (HSPC) to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). To molecularly stratify this patient subgroup we correlate CHD1 status with markers of prostate cancer including AR, ERG, PTEN and Ki67. Finally, we analyze the impact of alterations in CHD1 on outcome and response to therapy of CRPC patients. We retrospectively identified 52 patients of whom HSPC and CRPC tissue was available for immunohistochemical analysis of CHD1, ERG, PTEN, AR and Ki67 as well as for CHD1 fluorescence in situ hybridization. Relationship with outcome was analyzed using univariate Cox regression and log-rank analyses. By using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a cohort of 52 men who developed CRPC, we show that the frequency of loss of CHD1 does not change during disease progression (7.7% in HSPC vs 9.6% in CRPC). Homozygously deleted tumors demonstrate a tendency towards poorer prognosis but this observation lacks statistical power in our cohort. Interestingly, in patients that show CHD1 protein expression in their hormone nave sample, a decrease of expression in the matched CRPC sample correlates with poorer overall survival (OS) (p = 0.03). Although preclinical data suggest a role for CHD1 in androgen receptor (AR) activity, CHD1 expression did not correlate with AR protein level. Additionally, Ki67 expression did not show correlation with CHD1 levels of expression. Further molecular stratification confirms a known mutual exclusive relationship with the expression of the ERG transcription factor (p = 0.048). Clinically, although decreased CHD1 protein expression during disease progression correlated with worse outcome (overall survival (p = 0.03) and survival from diagnosis of CRPC (p = 0.02)), no significant impact on survival after docetaxel or abiraterone treatment was measured.Here we monitor CHD1 deletion during prostate cancer progression.

Currently, there are only a limited number of targeted therapies that act by increasing senescence in cancers but these therapies are not selective for cancer cells.  Methods', '  We developed a combined chemical and shRNA screening platform to identify compounds that selectively enhance senescence in Pten deficient cells without affecting normal cells. By using this approach, we identified several Casein Kinase II (CK2) inhibitors as highly effective and selective pro-senescence compounds in Pten null cells and tumors.  Results', '  We have identified CK2 inhibitors through our chemogenomic platform and furthur validated using shRNA kinase library. These compounds have enhanced the cellular senescence in Pten deficient cells. Mechanistically, we find that CK2 mRNA and protein levels are strongly up regulated in Pten null cells and PML is downregulated. Interestingly, CK2 transcription depends on the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, STAT3 that is highly phosphorylated in Pten null tumors. Treatment of Pten null prostate tumors with CK2 inhibitors has lead to the stabilization of PML thereby restoring its tumor suppressor activity; which then prompts more cells to enter senescence leading to tumor regression.   Conclusions', '  Using our novel platform technologies we have discovered better pro-senescence compounds and systematically validating them in vitro and in vivo. We disocvered the possible mechanism behind the target based selective enhancement of senescence in Pten loss prostate cancer.

        "Background":"['Androgen ablation therapy is the standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer. While tumors initially respond to androgen deprivation, they almost always recur with an androgen-independent phenotype termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Castration-resistant tumors are incurable with current therapy regimens and account for most prostate cancer mortality. Better understanding of their biology is therefore critical for devising novel treatment options. Steroid Receptor Coactivator 3 (SRC-3) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that promotes growth of endocrine tissues. It enhances proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines and is highly expressed in advanced human prostate tumors. Despite this, the role of SRC-3 in CRPC is not well studied. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in most human prostate cancers. Mice harboring PTEN deletion in prostatic epithelial cells develop cancer that arises from progenitors in the luminal epithelial and basal compartments. Tumors histologically mimic advanced human disease and are castration-resistant. We hypothesized that, in prostate tumors caused by PTEN deletion, SRC-3 is a critical mediator for accelerating the development of CRPC. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice in which floxed PTEN and SRC-3 genes were concomitantly deleted in prostate epithelial cells via a Cre recombinase driven by the Probasin promoter. We first compared tumor mass, histology and biomarkers in these PTENf/f/SRC-3f/f/ARR2PBiCre (pten3cko) mice vs. PTENf/f/ARR2PBiCre (ptencko) mice. We found that while tumor growth in pten3cko mice was slightly inhibited at 9 wks of age, tumor histology and cellular composition were not markedly different. We then castrated mice of both genotypes at 9-wks-old and harvested tumors at 12wks. Interestingly, castrated ptencko mice had significantly worsened tumor aggressivenessas indicated by increased proliferation index, reduced differentiation (increased p63; decreased K5 and K8) and increased reactive stroma (double staining of SMA and vimentin)versus their non-castrated counterparts. Amazingly, in addition to significantly reducing tumor size, SRC-3 ablation reversed all changes comprising the aggressive phenotype seen in the post-castration tumors. Further investigation showed SRC-3 deletion decreased mTOR signaling. Together, these data show that castration induces a worse tumor phenotype in the setting of PTEN deletion and that SRC-3 promotes this process by inducing epithelial cell proliferation and enhancing the growth-promoting effect of these cells on the stroma. Therefore, SRC-3 may serve as a potential target for controlling CRPC development.']",

Inhibition of autophagy can promote senescence resulting in decreased tumor growth. Genetic alterations of PTEN and p53 are frequently present in advanced human prostate cancer and are associated with poor prognosis. In mouse models, the inactivation of PTEN leads to the development of prostate tumors that progress slowly, in part due to the induction of PTEN-(loss)-induced cellular senescence. Concomitant inactivation of both PTEN and P53 in prostate leads to the development of an aggressive cancer phenotype that can overcome PTEN-(loss)-induced cellular senescence and is characterized with accelerated growth, metastatic development and decreased survival. Published findings show that in some cancer models, the effects of autophagy inhibition are dependent on p53 status. In this study we assessed the effects of pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) on the growth and progression of mouse prostate tumors driven by the concomitant inactivation of PTEN and p53. CQ is a lysosomotropic agent that has widely used to impede autophagy and inhibit the growth of human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.

In the present study we examined the IL6-induced Stat3 transcriptional activation in the development and progression of prostate cancer and its possible role as a target for the treatment of prostate cancer using the prostate-specific conditional targeting PTEN knockout mouse model.

Several therapies are currently approved for use against CRPC, consisting mostly of androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors and toxic anti-microtubule chemotherapeutics that do not score long-term durable responses. Recent deep-sequencing analysis studies have elucidated the complex and heterogeneous landscape of CRPC, highlighting the necessity to develop effective targeted therapies against specific CRPC subtypes or therapies effective against numerous subtypes of CRPC. PTEN and p53 are two of the most frequently altered genes in CRPC, and are associated with therapy resistance and a poor clinical prognosis. The objective of this study was to identify and subsequently validate therapeutic targets against models of advanced PCa, specifically in the absence of PTEN and p53. Using non-biased high throughput screening technology, we identified HSP90 inhibitors to be potent and efficacious against a model of PTEN/p53 null PCa. HSP90 is a critical regulator of prostate cancer cell signaling homeostasis, and recently developed second generation compounds targeting HSP90 are effective against genotypically heterogeneous panels of cancer cell lines and have favorable safety parameters in the clinic. Screening results and subsequent validation efforts in vitro identified ganetespib as the most potent HSP90 inhibitor, with efficacy that translated into established human PCa cells lines. Ganetespib also displayed strongly inhibitory activity against PTEN/p53 null progenitor cells, a plastic subpopulation of PCa believed to be partly responsible for therapy resistance. In vivo, ganetespib completely inhibited progression of PIN to invasive adenocarcinoma in the Pten/Tp53 null PCa mouse model, leading to a significant reduction in tumor weight. Expanding from the mouse model to clinically predictive PDX-derived LuCaP models of human PCa, we found that ganetespib displayed a range of activity against a genotypically diverse array of 11 LuCaP organoids ex vivo. Furthermore, the PTEN null/p53 altered LuCaP 136 displayed a robust response to ganetespib in vivo, with ganetespib causing a significant reduction in tumor growth. Mechanistic interrogation in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo revealed ganetespib induced effects to be multifactorial and model specific, with unifying trends being inactivation of PI3K signaling and modulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins. In all, these data indicate that inhibition of HSP90 is a novel therapeutic to treat advanced PCa via multifactorial perturbation of growth regulatory pathways.']",

Interestingly, many evidences support the idea that a strong interplay occurs between senescence, cancer cells, and tumor infiltrating immune populations, thus opening at the possibility to tune such interplay for cancer treatment. Indeed, tumor infiltrating T helper 1 cells can drive senescence in cancers in a cytokine-induced manner, by secreting IFN and TNF in the tumor microenvironment.

By feeding Ptenp-/- mice with the AIN93M or 0.2% δ-T supplemented diet starting at the age of 6 or 12 weeks, we found that, at the age of 40 weeks, δ-T treatment reduced the number of invasive prostate adenocarcinoma by 53.3% (p<0.005) and 42.7% (p<0.001), respectively. By immunohistochemical analysis, the activation of AKT via phosphorylation of AKT(T308) was found reduced in the prostate of the mice on δ-T diet. Consistently, proliferation was reduced and apoptosis was increased in prostate of the mice on δ-T diet. We also determined oxidative stress by immunohistochemical staining of 8-OH-dG and nitro-tyrosine, and found that these markers were not altered during prostate tumorigenesis, nor they were affected by δ-T. A 0.2% α-tocopherol diet was also used to feed Ptenp-/- mice, but did not inhibit the development of prostate adenocarcinoma, consistent with previous data demonstrating that α-tocopherol did not inhibit the activation of AKT. Together, these results support that δ-T is effective in supressing the development of prostate adenocarcinoma in Ptenp-/- mice through inhibition of AKT activation.']",

MTA1/HDAC unit is a part of the multi-protein nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex. In our previous studies we found that MTA1 expression is significantly increased in prostate-specific Pten-null model, and that potent natural analog of resveratrol, pterostilbene (PTER), exerts its anti-tumorigenic effects by blocking MTA1-associated inactivation (deacetylation) of tumor suppressors. SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamine, vorinostat) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of tumor cell growth. We hypothesize that targeting MTA1/HDAC unit of NuRD complex using PTER in combination with SAHA could act additively or synergistically to block prostate tumor progression in vivo with higher efficacy and lower toxicity. In the current study, we utilized the prostate-specific Pten-null mouse model to evaluate the MTA1/HDAC mediated anti-cancer efficacy of combinatorial approach for dietary PTER and clinically approved HDAC inhibitor, SAHA. After a series of carefully designed breeding strategies and genotyping, we collected 30 prostate-specific luciferase expressing Pten knockout (Pten f/f; Rosa26Luc/+; Pb-Cre4) male mice for our experiments.

        "Background":"['Emerging observations from clinical trials suggest that a subset of castration resistant prostate adenocarcinomas (CRPC) eventually evolve or progress to a predominantly neuroendocrine phenotype (NEPC). This transition is emerging as an important mechanism of treatment resistance. This cell plasticity is characterized by loss of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA), and significant over-expression and gene amplification of MYCN (encoding N-Myc). While N-Myc is a bona fide driver oncogene in several rare tumor types, the molecular mechanisms that underlie N-Myc driven NEPC have yet to be characterized.Integrating a novel genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of prostate specific N-Myc overexpression, human prostate cancer cell line modeling, and human prostate cancer transcriptome data, we found that N-Myc over-expression leads to the development of poorly differentiated, invasive prostate cancer that is molecularly similar to human NEPC tumors. To determine if N-Myc plays a causal role in driving the NEPC phenotype, we generated GEM lines that carry a CAG-driven lox-stop-lox human MYCN gene integrated into the ROSA26 (LSL-MYCN) locus and either a Tmprss2 driven tamoxifen-activated Cre recombinase (T2-Cre) or probasin (Pb)-Cre. Since PTEN deletion is a frequent alteration in CRPC and PI3K/AKT signaling can enhance N-Myc protein stability we also engineered the mice with a floxed Pten locus. N-Myc over-expression in the context of Ptenf/+ at 3 months post-induction leads to focal mouse high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mHGPIN). T2-Cre; Ptenf/f; LSL-MYCN+/+ mice develop highly proliferative, diffuse mHGPIN which consists of proliferations of cells with nuclear atypia that expand the glands, imparting irregular borders and inducing a mild stromal response, mitotic figures, and incipient necrosis. RNAseq data from N-Myc these mHGPIN lesions show they are molecularly similar to NEPC based on RNAseq data from 203 human CRPC and NEPC samples. At 6 months, Pb-Cre; Ptenf/f; LSL-MYCN+/+ mice develop poorly differentiated, highly proliferative, invasive prostate cancer.Based on the RNAseq data from the N-Myc GEM line, GEM-derived mouse prostate cancer organoid cultures and isogenic cell lines, we found that N-Myc regulates a specific NEPC-associated molecular program that includes a repression of AR signaling, enhanced AKT signaling and repression of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 target genes. We further showed that N-Myc interacts with AR and this interaction depends on Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2). Finally, N-Myc expressing cell lines and organoids displayed an enhanced sensitivity to inhibitors targeting the AKT pathway, EZH2 and Aurora-A.Altogether, our data shows that N-Myc drives the neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer and provides rationale for the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating this aggressive subtype of prostate cancer.']",

The availability of these models would facilitate studies to elucidate the molecular events underlying disease progression, and would be invaluable for evaluating new treatment efficacy. Within extant mouse models, metastasis is rare and typically occurs at an advanced age. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic approach, we generated mice in which Hoxb13 regulatory elements drive expression of human MYC (Hoxb13MYC+) or Cre recombinase (Hoxb13Cre+). Hoxb13Cre+ mice were bred to mice carrying floxed Pten (Ptenfl) alleles to generate focal loss of Pten in the prostate epithelium. We then generated mice carrying both the Hoxb13MYC+ and Hoxb13Cre+ transgenes that also harbored two Ptenfl alleles. Phenotypic analyses of Hoxb13MYC+|Hoxb13Cre+| Ptenfl/fl males revealed pervasive low-grade mouse-PIN (mPIN) in all prostate lobes emerging at two weeks of age that became pervasive that progressed to high-grade mPINby four weeks. The lesions bore hallmarks of human PIN including increased nuclear and nucleolar size and dispersed chromatin. Immunostaining revealed MYC and androgen receptor expression and focal Pten loss within the epithelial compartment. mPIN incidence high-gradewas higher in ventral and anterior lobes. By twelve weeks, lesions progressed to cribriform mPIN/intraductal carcinoma was widespread and scattered intraductal carcinoma lesions were observed. At sixteen weeks, in all animals, large frank invasive adenocarcinoma lesions involving multiple prostate lobes were was present as well as, and histological analyses confirmed the presence of invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, by 16 weeks, metastasis to pelvic and peritoneal lymph nodes occurred with 100% penetrance. In survival analyses, all Hoxb13MYC+|Hoxb13Cre+| Ptenfl/fl mice (N=12) reached criteria for euthanasia within 28 weeks. Liver and lung metastases were observed with high penetrance (>80%). In one case, metastatic spread to a thoracic vertebra was observed, which may represent the first hematogenous metastasis to bone in a mouse prostate cancer model. Copy number analyses using array-based comparative genomic hybridization revealed clonal gene gains and losses in primary prostate cancers and matched metastatic lesions, indicative of genomic instability. The incidence of aggressive cancer and the reproducible chronology of events will enable this model to serve as a robust platform to test strategies to interfere with disease initiation and progression. The lethal phenotype will permit analyses of potentially life extending therapies. In addition, these features will enable studies to dissect the pivotal molecular events that drive the stepwise progression/evolution of this disease.']",

Growth factors mediate such signaling pathways that include the PI3K/Akt/PTEN/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK as well as other essential pathways. However various mitigating factors such a genetic variation, molecular diversity, diverging and converging of signaling pathways make it improbable that treatment with any single agent will result in any long-term enhanced tumor. To overcome such problems we investigated the toxicity and antitumor effects of combined targeted therapy with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the mulitkinase inhibitor sorafenib in a prostate-specific PTEN conditional knockout mouse model of human prostate cancer.

Ki67 expression was decreased and positive TUNEL apoptotic bodies was increased in combination treatment groups compared to everolimus and sorafenib monotherapy in both non-castrated and CRPC treatment groups. We also show that combination therapy, but not monotherapy, cooperated to inhibit phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B).

During past the 20 years we have established and characterized a large series of LuCaP prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Herein, we present a summary of the biological and molecular characterization of these PDX LuCaP models.LuCaP PCa PDX models were derived from primary PCa and various sites of metastases. The histology of the LuCaP PDXs is similar to the originating clinical specimen, and the unsupervised gene expression array clustering analyses revealed an association between the xenograft and the originating specimen. Twenty four of the lines are adenocarcinoma and four exhibit a neuroendocrine phenotype. Characterization of the LuCaP PDX tumors includes expression arrays, RNASeq, exome sequencing, and IHC for multiple markers. Some of the models show Rb deletion, TMPRSS2/ERG translocation, PTEN deletion, PI3K activation and other critical characteristics detected in clinical specimens and associated with PCa progression. In vivo characterizations show responses to androgen suppression spanning the range of responses to this therapy seen in patients; differential levels of serum PSA, tumor-doubling time, and responses to docetaxel. Furthermore, seven of our models elicit an osteoblastic reaction when implanted in the bone.In summary the diversity of phenotypes and responses of the LuCaP PDXs to therapy are representative of responses seen in the clinical setting. Therefore, the LuCaP PCa PDXs are highly clinically relevant models to study PCa biology and evaluate new treatment modalities.

Methods\", ' IL17 receptor C (IL17RC) knockout mice were crossed with Pten conditional knockout mice (using ProbasinCre). Pten/ male mice with intact IL17 signaling (named RC+ mice, including IL17RC+/+ and IL17RC+/) were compared with Pten/ male mice without IL17 signaling (IL17RC/, named RC mice). Results', ' There was no difference between the weight of genitourinary bloc of RC+ mice and that of RC mice at 4, 6 and 9 weeks. At 12 and 30 weeks, the GUbloc weight of RC+ mice was 14% and 47% heavier than that of RC mice, respectively (P = 0.005, N = 54, and P = 0.004, N = 32, respectively). We found similar prostatic epithelial hyperplasia at 4 weeks and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) at 6 weeks in both RC+ and RC mice, suggesting that IL17RC knockout did not affect PIN formation. At 9 weeks, invasive cancer was formed in 87% of RC+ prostate lobes, but only in 25% of RC prostate lobes (P < 0.001). At 30 weeks, 100% of RC+ prostate lobes formed invasive cancer, whereas only 70% of RC prostate lobes showed invasive cancer (P < 0.005). This suggests that IL17RC knockout decreased progression of PIN to invasive cancer. The RC PINs were surrounded with a thick layer of fibromuscular stroma, whereas the stroma layer was significantly thinner in RC+ prostate glands, suggesting that failure of PIN to invade stroma was a critical deficit in RC mice. We found that MMP7 expression was significantly decreased in RC prostates compared to RC+ prostates, suggesting that lack of MMP7 expression is likely responsible for the observed phenotype. Furthermore, we found that IL17 treatment induced MMP7 mRNA and protein expression in exvivo cultured RC+ prostate tissues but not in RC prostate tissues, suggesting that MMP7 is a downstream target gene of IL17 signaling.

Results', ' We identified a 5-protein signature that correctly predicted 71% of cases belonging to patients having aberrant or normal PTEN status (sensitivity=68%, specificity=85%, AUC=0.85). In addition we identified a 3-protein signature that correctly predicted patients having tumors with a Gleason score  7(3+4) or  7(4+3) (AUC 0.92). Finally we found a 4-protein signature that discriminated between BPH and PCa with a sensitivity=78% and specificity=63% (AUC=0.74), in combination with PSA with a sensitivity=90% and specificity=83% (AUC=0.84). Conclusions', ' The identification of the 5-protein signature reflecting tissue PTEN status may aid in selecting patients to treat with inhibitors of the PI3K pathway. Combination of our 4-protein signature and PSA has a higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity than PSA alone and therefore may improve the effectiveness of PCa screening. The predictive 3-protein signature for Gleason score could facilitate decisions on individualized PCa treatment. Taken together our approach suggests a way for rational cancer biomarker discovery guided by human cancer genetics and based on integration of experimental mouse models, novel proteomics-based technologies and computational modeling.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6, also called BRK) is an intracellular SRC-related tyrosine kinase that does not possess canonical localization signals. Lack of targeting yields flexibility in its intracellular localization and access to substrates. PTK6 is observed in the nuclei of prostate epithelial cells where it promotes differentiation and inhibits growth. PTK6 is activated at the plasma membrane in PTEN-deficient mouse prostate tumors where the concentration of PIP3 is high due to PTEN loss of function. Membrane-associated PTK6 induces cell transformation, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and tumor cell metastasis. In human prostate cancer, active PTK6 associates with the plasma membrane and its increased expression correlates with metastasis and poor survival. Our studies aimed to characterize how the mislocalization and activation of PTK6 in prostate cancer is regulated.Results', ' Based on our observation that loss of PTEN induces accumulation of PTK6 at the membrane, we hypothesized that PTK6 binds to the plasma membrane secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Amino acid sequence alignment predicts H52, Y53, and K54 of PTK6 as a potential PIP3 binding site, which resembles the lipid-binding HYK domain of tyrosine kinases BTK and Abl. Using NMR saturation transfer difference (STD) experiment, we observed that the SH2 domain of PTK6 contains a binding site for inositol trisphosphate (IP3) a soluble PIP3 mimic. As predicted, statistical analysis identified Y53 of the PTK6 HYK motif within the SH2 domain as a residue with substantial chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) induced by independent titrations with PIP3 analogs IP3, IP4, and 1,2-dihexanoyl PIP3 in 15N HSQC, as compared to controls. Using autophosphorylated and unphosphorylated PTK6, NMR STD experiments show that only active (pY342) PTK6 binds to IP3. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin reduces active PTK6 at the plasma membrane.Conclusions', ' Our data demonstrate that active PTK6 is recruited to the plasma membrane through direct interactions with PIP3. Membrane association places PTK6 in close proximity to its oncogenic substrates AKT, FAK and BCAR1, thereby promoting tumor progression. These findings may facilitate identification of novel PTK6 inhibitors that block its association with the membrane, while not affecting its tumor suppressive role in the nucleus.This work is funded by NIH grant 1R01CA188427 to ALT and VG.']",

Stat3 has also been shown to induce the metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Activation of Stat3 occurs by the binding of various cytokines to its receptors leading to the activation of the JAK/Stat3 signaling pathway. Of these cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in regulating growth of various malignant tumors and activated IL-6 has been shown to be elevated in the sera from patients with metastatic prostate cancer. In the present study we examined the IL6-induced Stat3 transcriptional activation in the development and progression of prostate cancer and its possible role as a target for the treatment of prostate cancer using the prostate-specific conditional targeting PTEN knockout mouse model. Homozygous PTEN-mutants develop prostate cancer in a stage-specific manner and have the ability to grow and develop castration-resistant prostate cancer after total androgen ablation by castration.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed correlated expression of with Stat3 transcriptional activation, proliferation and androgen receptor in tumors from castrated mice. To determine the role of IL-6R induced transcriptional activation of Stat3, non-castrated and castrated tumor bearing mice were treated with an anti-mouse IL-6R antibody (MR-16). Mice treated with MR-16 showed downregulation of phosphorylated Stat3, however, treatment failed to inhibit tumor development and cellular proliferation. However, it was discovered that therapeutic doses of MR16 treatment resulted in increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2.

        "Background":"[\"Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a key cytokine in inflammation, which has been shown to play critical roles in development of prostate cancer, skin cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. We have previously demonstrated that IL-17 promotes prostate carcinogenesis, accompanied with increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) in the mouse prostate. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether MMP7 mediates IL-17's action and the underlying mechanisms. Mmp7 knockout (Mmp7/) mice were crossbred with phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) conditional knockout mice (Ptenpc-/, prostate-specific through probasin promoter-driven Cre recombinase). The prostate tumor phenotypes were analyzed among Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/, Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/, and Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice. MMP7-overexpression or MMP7 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was generated in human prostate cancer LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines to explore the molecular mechanisms of MMP7's actions. We found that Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice displayed prostates that were smaller than Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ or Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/ mice. Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice developed a reduced number of invasive prostate adenocarcinomas with lower rate of cellular proliferation and higher rate of apoptosis than Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ or Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/ mice. In addition, the invasiveness of prostate tumor cells isolated from Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice was significantly reduced compared to those isolated from Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ mice in Matrigel invasion assays. Expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as -catenin, vimentin, Snail, and Slug, was dramatically reduced in Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice compared to Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ or Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/ mice. In contrast, expression of the epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and claudin was increased in Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice compared to Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ or Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/ mice. MMP7 cleaved E-cadherin and disrupted E-cadherin/-catenin complex to increase cytoplasmic and nuclear -catenin levels in the prostate cancer cells, thus up-regulating EMT transcription factors. In addition, IL-17 receptor C (Il-17rc) and Pten double knockout (Il-17rc/;Ptenpc-/) mice echoed the reduction of EMT in Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice, compared to Il-17rc+/+;Ptenpc-/ mice. Further, IL-17 treatment induced MMP7 expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells, leading to increased expression of EMT markers.

        "Background":"['The development and progression of prostate cancer involves deregulation of several signaling pathways including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The mTOR kinase forms an important component of PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN are observed at high frequency during the development of prostate cancer and often accompanied by activation of AKT and mTOR pathways. We initiated studies to identify polyphenols from dietary sources that could interact with the mTOR receptor and in silico studies showed that fisetin physically interacts with mTOR. Fisetin is a tetrahydroxyflavone, found in strawberry, apple, persimmon, kiwi, onion and cucumber where it serves as a coloring agent. Blind docking of fisetin to the mTOR target was performed with Autodock4 using the NMR structure 2NPU from the Protein Data Bank. Results placed fisetin in two clustered sites located between and on either side of the 4 helices. The binding energies were in the -7 to -8 Kcal/mol range for the binding constant. The binding on one site included hydrogen bonding to a glutamate by two hydroxyl groups. The second site was mostly hydrophobic, with the ring of fisetin stacking on rings from the peptide. We used a unique family of human prostate epithelial cell lines, derived from RWPE-1 by exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) to study the effect of fisetin on mTOR signaling. The MNU cell lines, in order of increasing malignancy and phenotype are; WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, WPE1-NB11, and WPE1-NB26 and mimic multiple steps in the process of prostate carcinogenesis. We observed that transformed cells exhibited increase in the activity and phosphorylation of mTOR, PI3K, Akt, Erk and p-S6 that was associated with gradual loss of PTEN and decrease in the levels of p-AMPK, a negative regulator of mTOR. We treated cells with fisetin (0-80 M) for 24-72 hours and observed that transformed cells exhibited greater sensitivity to fisetin induced cell death. As cells transform from a normal phenotype to a malignant phenotype they acquire higher mTOR expression and become more susceptible to fisetin induced cell death. In presence of fisetin, cells expressing higher mTOR levels formed less number of colonies that were also smaller in size. Fisetin treatment resulted in inhibition of PI3K, p-Akt and p-Erk. Treatment of cells with fisetin, downregulated components of mTOR including Raptor, Rictor, PRAS40 and GL leading to loss of mTOR complexes 1/2. Fisetin also activated the mTOR repressor TSC2 through inhibition of Akt, activation of AMPK and PTEN. It is noteworthy that mTOR and Erk/MAPK signaling pathways function cooperatively to promote development of advanced prostate cancer. Our observations suggest that fisetin, through its ability to inhibit mTOR signaling, could be developed as a novel non-toxic agent for slowing the progression of the disease and as an adjuvant for the management of advanced prostate cancer.']",

The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of PTEN status on duration of response/time to progression in the expansion cohort, and to evaluate the impact of B on a PI3-kinase activation fingerprint in metastatic bone or lymph node tissue samples.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is manageable in its initial stages and when localized, but as it progresses it metastasizes and also becomes resistant to conventional chemotherapies. Identifying mechanisms that are related to the rapid progression of the disease could result in development of appropriate intervention strategies. We analyzed protein and mRNA expression of Grb10 (also known as insulin receptor-binding protein) in various PCa cell lines and found a significant decrease when compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. We also analyzed the expression pattern of Grb10 in a human PCa tissue array and found significant loss of Grb10 mRNA in more than 90% of the samples. Based on Gleason Score, the loss of Grb10 mRNA correlated with the stage and grade of the disease. These initial observations led us to hypothesize that Grb10 may act as a tumor suppressor whose expression is lost during the progression of human PCa. Using immuno-histochemical analysis of human PCa tissue samples we found loss of Grb10 protein with increasing tumor grade. We next analyzed various components of insulin signaling, based on the evidence that Grb10 expression is negatively correlated with insulin signaling. We observed significant increase at both mRNA and protein levels of IR, IGF-1R, IRS-1 and IRS-2 in PCa cells and tissues that directly correlated with loss of Grb10. Recently, Grb10 expression was shown to be negatively correlated with PTEN levels in different cancer types including PCa. We determined the expression pattern of Grb10 mRNA in prostate tissue samples from 15-weeks old PTEN wild type (WT) and PTEN knockout (KO) mice and observed that Grb10 levels were significantly down-regulated in PTEN-KO mice suggesting that loss of PTEN results in loss of Grb10. Further analysis suggested increased insulin signaling in PTEN-KO mice compared to PTEN-WT mice confirming negative regulation of Grb10 with insulin signaling. To further understand the role of Grb10 in PCa, we overexpressed Grb10 in human PCa DU145 (PTEN-mutated) cells. Overexpression of Grb10 resulted in decrease in colony formation, migration and invasion that was associated with down-regulation of insulin signaling. In summary, our findings suggest that Grb10 is a negative regulator of insulin signaling whose expression is lost in PCa in humans and correlates well with disease progression and aggressiveness. We conclude that Grb10 is a tumor suppressor in human PCa whose loss promotes rapid progression of the disease. Identification of this novel role of Grb10 could open up new strategies for the management of human PCa.']",

        "Background":"['A central challenge in prostate cancer is identification of those men with prostate cancer whose disease will eventually progress to the lethal castration-resistant stage. Understanding molecular events leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and identifying new disease markers are critical for the development of improved therapies for such patients. Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS transcription factors, such as ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer (PCa). It is widely presumed that ectopically expressed ETV1 (mainly due to gene fusions) plays a similar role in prostate tumorigenesis to that of ERG. However, we found that high levels of ETV1 expression are often associated with more advanced PCa in patient cohorts tested, whereas ERG overexpression is mainly associated with localized PCa and with elevated androgen receptor (AR) signaling. These data suggest that ETV1 and ERG may play different roles in prostate tumorigenesis. To address this question, we have generated Tmprss2-ERG (T-ERG) and Tmprss2-ETV1 (T-ETV1) knockin mouse models, targeting the two most prevalent ETS family members involved in fusions in PCa. Although, male mice carrying ERG or ETV1 targeted to the endogenous Tmprss2 locus alone are normal, either factor cooperated with Pten-loss, leading to localized cancer. Interestingly, only ETV1 supported development of advanced adenocarcinoma under Pten-loss background. To learn the molecular insights underlying this difference, we then focused mechanistic studies on the identification of chromosomal targets directly bound by ERG and ETV1. We showed that ERG and ETV1 control a common transcriptional network but largely in an opposing fashion. In particular, while ERG negatively regulates the AR transcriptional program, ETV1 cooperates with AR signaling by favoring its activation. Then, we performed microarray gene expression profiling for mouse prostate epithelial cells carrying T-ETV1 knockin allele alone. Strikingly, by gene set enrichment analysis, we found in T-ETV1 prostate cells (compared to controls), most top enriched gene sets from the KEGG pathway database are related to steroid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Consistent with this, when we castrated T-ETV1 knockin males, we found a significant portion of ETV1 expressing prostate cells (tracked by GFP expression) could survive castration long-term. Moreover, we found that ETV1 expression, but not that of ERG, promotes autonomous testosterone production. These data suggest that ETV1 may reprogram metabolism toward steroid synthesis, which may promote progression to castration-resistant state. Lastly, patient data confirmed association of ETV1 expression and androgen metabolism. Thus, the distinct biology of ETV1-associated prostate cancer suggests that this disease class may require new therapies directed to the underlying programs controlled by ETV1.']",

Previous studies from our own and other laboratories showed the anti-tumorigenic potential of 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME2) in various tumor models. Although variety of mechanisms including anti-angiogenic, pro-apoptotic, cell cycle deregulation has been reported to contribute to 2-ME2-mediated biological effects, the precise mechanism is unclear. To explore the role of 2-ME2, we carried out gene expression array analysis and discovered Recepteur dOrigine Nantais (RON) as one of the most significantly down regulated gene in response to 2-ME2 treatment. Subsequently, RON was found to be significantly upregulated in advanced-stage PCA cell lines, which do not express androgen receptor (AR); and high-grade human prostate tumors. Stable silencing of RON in androgen independent, PTEN-/- PC3 cells showed noticeable changes in cell morphology, actin filament organization, as well as markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In PTEN wild type DU145 cells, RON knockdown caused an increase in AR expression and promoter activity but decreased the transcriptional activation and expression of AR target genes such as PSA. In contrast, RON overexpression in androgen-responsive LNCAP cells leads to a suppression of the transcriptional activation of both AR and its downstream targets, including PSA. Furthermore, we found that RON silencing decreases expression and promoter activity of the anti-apoptotic protein FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) that is accompanied by the induction of apoptosis. In addition, intervention with 2-ME2 reduced tumor growth that is accompanied with decreased RON expression in the prostate in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. These observations implicate RON as a hijacker of AR signaling that contributes in part to PCA growth. Therefore, restoration of native AR signaling via RON targeting could possibly be exploited in combination with antiandrogenic therapy to prevent recurrence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

The integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) plays a vital role in the migration and adhesion of prostate cancer (PCa) cells to fibronectin secreted by bone-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Joshi, 2015), architects of a metastatic niche (Shiozawa, 2011). Hypothesis', ' The mechanism(s) whereby ITGA5 regulates the survival and chemoresistance in PCa may define novel therapeutic approaches. Methods and Results', ' To assess the pro-survival function of ITGA5 in PCa, we found that ITGA5 shRNA reduced bcl-2 and bcl-xl expression, and induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In these PTEN-mutant (mt) AR-negative(-) cells, pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway (BKM120) in combination with ITGA5 knockdown synergistically induced apoptosis as assessed by induction of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. Similarly, BKM120 in combination with pharmacological inhibition of bcl-2/bcl-xL (ABT263) also induced apoptosis in synergistic fashion in PC-3 cells. Synergistic apoptosis with PI3-kinase inhibitors (BKM120, pictilisib) and ABT-263 was restricted to PTEN-mt PC-3 and LNCaP cells and was not observed in PTEN-wt, AR- DU145 cells. The pan-Akt-inhibitor GDC-0068 in combination with ABT263 induced apoptosis specifically in PTEN-mt AR+ LNCaP and C4-2B cells. By contrast, there was diminished evidence of synergy of PI3-Kinase inhibitors and bcl-2 specific inhibition with ABT199 pointing toward the requirement of bcl-xl inhibition. However, resistance to longer-term therapy with PI3K and bcl-xl/bcl-2 inhibition was observed in PC-3 but not LNCaP cells. Although single-agent PI3K inhibitor therapy downregulates ITGA5 expression in PC-3 cells, by contrast bcl-2/bcl-xl inhibitor therapy, alone or in combination with PI3K inhibitor therapy, strongly upregulates ITGA5 expression together with Akt activation suggesting that ITGA5 represents a pathway of resistance to combinatorial therapy through feedback loop signals generated with bcl-xl inhibition. In support of this hypothesis, ITGA5 knockdown together with BKM120 and ABT263 combinatorial therapy blocked the upregulation of ITGA5 and associated Akt activation, further reduced bcl-xl expression, and enhanced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In PTEN-wild type AR-positive VCAP cells, evidence for synergistic apoptosis with PI3K and bcl-2/bcl-xl inhibition was also obtained suggesting that the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion may phenocopy the pro-survival pathways of PTEN-deficient cells.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer is highly dependent on androgen receptor (AR) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways for survival and disease progression. Preclinical evidence suggests that combinatorial approaches targeting both AR and PI3K/AKT activity improves treatment efficacy. However, sustained responses from traditional and next-generation anti-androgen therapies targeting AR remain elusive in clinical practice due to inherent/acquired resistance resulting in lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Mechanisms for continued AR transcriptional activity may be ligand dependent or independent but still require AR gene expression. Persistent AR gene expression is a key feature of CRPC. Thus, blocking AR gene expression by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) is a logical approach to CRPC. We previously showed that monotherapy with ISIS581088, a generation 2.5 ASO targeting mouse AR, demonstrated strong antitumor activity in a transgenic mouse model of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. In this study we show the antitumor effects of combined therapy of ISIS581088 and AZD5363, a potent AKT inhibitor and demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of combination therapy in a clinically relevant mouse model of CRPC. Sixteen-week-old mice with PTEN-/- castration-naïve prostate tumors were treated with ISIS581088 and AZD5363 alone or in combination for four weeks. Tumor growth inhibition rates were 41.2%, 20.2% and 54.4% for ISIS581088, AZD5363 and ISIS581088/AZD5363 treatment groups, respectively, P<0.001. In a model of mouse CRPC, 16-week-old mice with PTEN-/- castration-resistant prostate tumors (eight weeks post castration) experienced reduced tumor burden with all treatments but no enhancement was observed when the compounds were administered in combination compared with monotherapy drug treatments. In a randomized trial of advanced CRPC in PTEN/P53 double knockout mice, combination therapy significantly increased overall survival.

In conclusion, our data shows that combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden in mice with castration-naïve tumors compared to those treated with monotherapy. Notably, combination therapy did not produce an additive effect in an early stage CRPC intervention model. Still, combination therapy demonstrated a clear advantage in prolonging overall survival in a long-term randomized mouse trial of PTEN/P53-deficient CRPC. Thus, our data provides preclinical evidence to support that next generation ASOs targeting AR in combination with AKT inhibition is a potentially effective treatment approach for CRPC.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common form of cancer in men. Treatment for prostate cancer remains a challenge, particularly for castrate resistant prostate cancer. Hormonal therapy such as androgen ablation often fails as cancer cells utilize alternative mechanisms for survival and eventually progress to castrate resistant PCa. Currently, understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying castrate resistant PCa development is limited. Strong evidence demonstrates that castrate resistant PCa continues to depend on androgen receptor signaling. Novel compounds targeting androgen receptor activity and androgen synthesis are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical studies; however alternate therapeutic approaches for castrate resistant PCa are needed. Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an abundant molecular chaperone and plays a crucial role in structural formation and folding of a variety of proteins including androgen receptor, Akt, and other oncogenic proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 creates the potential to suppress tumor activity as enforced disassociation induces proteosomal degradation of Hsp90 client proteins. This study utilized four genetically defined murine PCa epithelial cell lines, MYC-CaP (AR+ amplified, Pten +), MYC-Cap css (Castrate resistant, AR= amplified, Pten+), Pten-CaP E2 (Androgen sensitive, AR+, Pten null), and Pten-CaP cE2 (Castrate resistant, AR+, Pten null) to investigate the cellular response to Hsp90 inhibition. Cells were exposed in vitro to NVP-AUY922, a novel Hsp90 inhibitor at increasing concentrations for 24 and 48 hours. Results demonstrated that AUY922 treatment induced reduction in overall growth in all cell lines, with Pten-CaP and castrate resistant Pten-CaP being more sensitive (IC50 = 10nM) than MYC-CaP and MYC-Cap css (IC50 = 25nM) cells. Inhibition of cell growth was also indicated by induced cell cycle arrest in all cell lines, though AUY922 treatment did not result in significant increase in cell membrane permeability. Overall, our preliminary data indicates that AUY922 exhibits strong anti-growth effects in PCa cell lines and warrants further investigation as a potential novel targeted therapy to treat advanced and castrate resistant PCa.']",

        "Background":"['There is an urgent need to develop novel biomarkers of treatment response for precision medicine in prostate cancer, particularly in the setting of localized, non-indolent disease, which represents the vast majority of cases at initial clinical presentation. The Canadian Prostate Cancer Genome Network (CPC-GENE) - a member of the International Cancer Genome Consortium - aims to identify multi-modal prognostic and predictive signatures of therapeutic outcome based on intrinsic tumour genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, which are being incorporated into novel clinical trials of treatment escalation/de-escalation for image-guided radiotherapy and/or radical prostatectomy. Herein we report the results of the largest prostate cancer whole-genome sequencing study to date, consisting of 194 patients and whole-exome sequencing of 479 patients with localized, potentially curable disease; a sample size that allows for saturating discovery of genes mutated at 1% frequency. We show that tumours treated by curative local therapy have a paucity of clinically-actionable mutations relative to high-risk localized or metastatic disease, but instead harbor a significant number of recurrent non-coding aberrations and genomic rearrangements, including a novel inversion - and an associated reduction in gene expression - of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 10. The median tumour contains three distinct driver mutations, with >86% of tumours possessing at least one known driver. Importantly, multiple driver aberrations are associated with patient outcome, including copy number aberrations and methylation events, but notably excluding well-described recurrent events such as TMPRSS2', 'ERG fusions and SPOP point mutations. Localized hypermutation events (e.g. kataegis) were detected in >20% of tumours, and were strongly enriched for aggressive disease. Taken together, these data provide a comprehensive analysis of the genomic landscape of localized, non-indolent prostate cancer. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that specific molecular aberrations may serve as useful biomarkers for improved pre-treatment stratification of patients with localized, low/intermediate risk disease into escalation/de-escalation protocols, and support the development of clinical trials to assess this hypothesis, based on patient-specific molecular profiles.']",

A phase II randomized discontinuation trial of cabo showed clinical activity in CRPC patients. However, not all patients responded to cabo, and most of the responding patients eventually experienced disease progression. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of cabo in a preclinical setting using xenograft models of CRPC with differential phenotypes to obtain insight into which tumor types might be sensitive to cabo, and to investigate mechanisms of action of this agent.We used LuCaP 35CR, a PTEN- ERG+ Rb+ CRPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) that exhibits amplification of the androgen receptor (AR); LuCaP 96CR, a PTEN+ ERG- Rb+ CRPC PDX with high levels of intra-tumoral androgens; LuCaP 86.2, a PTEN- ERG+ Rb- CRPC PDX that expresses the AR v5-7 variant and is not responsive to endocrine therapy; and LuCaP 93, a PTEN- ERG- Rb- neuroendocrine CRPC PDX. Expression of cabo targets in these models was determined by qPCR. Animals were treated with 30 mg/kg cabo p.o. for six weeks (5d on/2d off), and tumor volume (TV), serum PSA and body weights were monitored. IHC and expression arrays were used to analyze effects of cabo. Cabo was effective in halting tumor growth in all four PDXs. Significant inhibition of TV was evident after one week of cabo treatment compared to control groups. PSA values were also significantly lower after one week of the treatment in all three adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, cabo treatment resulted in significant survival benefits in LuCaP 35CR, LuCaP 96CR and LuCaP 93 without significant decreases in body weight. IHC analysis showed decreased microvessel density in all cabo-treated groups vs control groups, suggesting effects on tumor environment. qPCR analysis showed that all models expressed some cabo targets though at different levels, but we did not observe any associations between magnitude of cabo effects and levels of the its targets in the tumors; inhibition of LuCaP 93, which expresses the highest levels of cabo targets, was similar to that of LuCaP 96CR, which expresses low levels of cabo targets. Our analyses of expression profiles of tumors following cabo treatment showed very little overlap between the models. However, E2F1 signaling, was inhibited by cabo in Rb- PDXs LuCaP 93 and LuCaP 86.2, but not in the Rb+ PDXs LuCaP 35CR and LuCaP 96CR. Also, expression of genes regulated by androgen was increased in the Rb- tumors and decreased (LuCaP 35CR) or was not altered (LuCaP 96CR) in the Rb+ tumors, and the levels of nuclear AR showed a similar pattern.

        "Background":"['Immune checkpoint proteins including programmed death ligand 1, 2 (PD-L1, PD-L2) and B7-H3 play important roles for immune evasion in many cancer types. PD-L1 is an established therapeutic target in lung cancer and in a growing number of other indications. The clinical success of PD-L1 inhibitors has accelerated the development of drugs also targeting PD-L2 and B7-H3. In prostate cancer, studies on the prevalence and clinical relevance of these proteins have been inconclusive. Here, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1, PD-L2 and B7-H3 in our large prostate cancer prognosis tissue microarray (TMA) containing tissue samples from more than 17,000 patients. Normal prostate glands were negative for PD-L1 and B7-H3, but positive for PD-L2. We found that 47% of 12,808 interpretable cancers showed B7-H3 expression, and 92% of 9,463 cancers showed PD-L2 expression, while expression of PD-L1 was virtually absent (0.2% of 17,392 tumors) in epithelial cells. Stroma cells and immune cells were entirely negative for PD-L1 and B7-H3, while some faint staining of lymphocytes was occasionally observed for PD-L2. In cancers, PD-L2 and B7-H3 staining had different prognostic impact, which depended on the ERG status', ' B7-H3 expression was linked to young patient age, advanced stage, high Gleason grade, lymph node metastasis (p<0.0001 each), presence of PTEN deletion (p<0.0001), and poor prognosis in ERG negative cancers (p<0.0001), while PD-L2 expression was linked to beneficial tumor features and good prognosis exclusively in tumors with ERG fusion (p<0.0001). In a multivariate analysis including pT stage, Gleason grade, nodal stage, resection margin and preoperative PSA level, B7-H3 expression was an independent prognostic factor (p=0.0004). In summary, the results of our study identify a subset of young patients with ERG negative aggressive prostate cancers that might benefit from anti-B7-H3 therapy in the future. PD-L2 expression appears to protect tumors from progression and does not seem to be suitable as a potential target in prostate cancer. PD-L1 expression is extremely rare in this disease, suggesting that only few prostate cancer patients might benefit from PD-L1 inhibitors.']",

However, there are no clinical tests or factors that can reliably predict treatment responses for the advanced prostate cancer patients. Examination of tumor component in circulation, also known as liquid biopsy, has shown promise for predicting treatment outcomes and survival. To capture the tumor-derived genomic alterations and decrease the surrogacy of using PSA measurements as is currently performed, we propose a Plasma Genomic Abnormality (PGA) score and Treatment Efficacy (TEff) index based on copy number variations as estimated by cell free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma. We first performed whole genome and targeted sequencing (NimbleGen comprehensive cancer panel) to examine plasma cfDNA for tumor-associated genetic and genomic aberrations in 10 HSPC patients receiving ADT and 10 CRPC patients receiving chemotherapy. For each patient, we tested plasma from two time points', ' pre-treatment and 4 months post-treatment. We then calculated the PGA score by summing the most significant genomic abnormalities with higher PGA score indicating greater tumor DNA content in cfDNA. TEff index was derived from comparison of PGA score difference between treatments with higher TEff index reflecting a better treatment response. The sequencing-based copy number analysis revealed locus-specific gains or losses including those previously reported in prostate cancers, such as 8q gains, AR amplifications, PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. We found that overall PGA score was significantly higher in CRPC patients than in HSPC patients (p<0.0005), possibly reflecting increased tumor burden during the disease progression. Patients with low TEff index often demonstrated poor response to treatments, and patients with high initial PGA score or low TEff index tended to have poor overall survival. As examples of the PGA-based TEff associations with outcome we presented three CRPC patients including two with neuro-endocrine origin (small cell carcinoma). Comparison of mutational profiles between pre- and post-treatments showed that treatments caused more diverse gene mutations, in particular, in the genes involving androgen biosynthesis, AR activation, DNA repair and chemotherapy resistance, suggesting subclonal evolution of heterogeneous tumor genomes in response to these treatments. Our results strongly support the feasibility of using non-invasive liquid biopsy as a potential powerful tool to study biological mechanisms underlying therapy-specific resistance and monitor disease progression in the advanced prostate cancer. Further studies are needed to develop and validate the genomics-based PGA score and TEff index for clinical applications.']",

Pim-1 has been shown to be overexpressed in a variety of cancers and has been implicated in human prostate tumorigenesis. The aim of our study was to clarify the role of Pim-1 during the prostate tumorigenesis and determine its potential as a molecular target for therapy. To accomplish this goal, we carried out a series of experiments using a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer driven by the conditional inactivation of PTEN. High levels of Pim-1 were observed during the early stages of the tumorigenesis process which decreased as tumors progressed. Expression of Pim-1 was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), well-differentiated, and moderately-differentiated tumors. In poorly-differentiated tumors, Pim-1expression was heterogeneously expressed at lower levels and was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of cancer cells. Levels of Pim-1 expression were increased in tumors from mice after surgical castration.

Tumor initiating cells (TICs) are capable of self-renewal and comprise a subset of the tumor mass. These cells are proposed to drive the growth and metastasis of tumors, and are considered to be resistant to traditional cytotoxic and targeted therapies. Several studies have shown that NF-κB signaling is increased in recurrent prostate cancer and enriched in prostate TICs. We sought to determine the potential of an IKK/NF-κB-driven mechanism for inherent or acquired resistance by IKK-mediated control of a subset of prostate tumor initiating cells. These studies were performed by using established prostate cancer cell lines, murine prostate organoids, and a murine prostate cancer animal model. We have found that inhibition of IKKα and IKKβ, upstream regulators of noncanonical and canonical NF-κB signaling, block self-renewal of several PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we have also found that IKK is important for tumorigenicity and stemness seen in prostate cancer cells as measured by colony formation and extreme limiting dilution assays. Loss of canonical NF-κB (p65/RelA) decreased stemness while loss of noncanonical did not alter tumorsphere formation. Interestingly, Pten-/- tumors with loss of Ikkα or Ikkβ displayed decreased levels of self-renewing cells as measured by CD49fhigh expression, a known prostate basal cell marker. Isolated murine Pten-/- cells were 2x more efficient than Pten-/-Ikkα-/- or Pten-/-Ikkβ-/- cells in forming prostate organoids suggesting that loss of Ikk decreased the number of self-renewing cells needed for formation.

Multiple approved therapies target the androgen signaling axis in this metastatic disease, however, after advancing to the androgen-independent stage, PCa is unresponsive to androgen ablation therapy and is refractory to further curative treatment. Recent advances have demonstrated that two intracellular signaling pathways promote prostate cancer progression, one is the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway included multiple FGFs and 4 kinds of FGF receptors (FGFR), which remains activated in the cancer cells, the other is the oncogenic PI3K/AKT pathway, which is constantly active due to the loss of an important tumor suppressor gene. Targeted inhibition of FGF and AKT signaling pathways has shown promising both in vitro and in vivo studies. However, FGFR or AKT inhibitor, as a single agent, would result in a reciprocal feedback loop. Therefore, it is imperative that both pathways be targeted simultaneously in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. In this study, we evaluated the effect of combined treatment of FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 and AKT inhibitor AZD5363 on PCa progression. Proliferation assay shows that AZD4547 just weakly, or not inhibits PCa cell proliferation, AZD5363 significantly inhibits PCa cell proliferation; the combined treatment of AZD4547 and AZD5363 shows similar inhibition effect to AZD5363. Both AZD4547 and AZD5363 inhibit PCa cell anchorage-independent growth and invasion, which are synergistically decrease by the combined treatment. AZD4547 significantly inhibits phosporylation of FGFR1 and FGFR4 in PCa cells; AZD5363 increases FGFR1 and FGFR4 phosphorylation, which was significantly repressed in combined treatment. The activation of FGFR2, MEK1/2, and Erk1/2 in PCa cells was remarkably inhibited by AZD4547 but increased by AZD5363, and synergistically inhibited by the combined treatment. AKT was hyperphosphorylated by AZD5363 and inhibited by AZD4547. The phosporylation of AKT downstream molecules PRAS40, GSK3 and S6, was slightly decreased by AZD4547 but strongly inhibited by AZD5363 and the combined treatment. Both AZD4547 and AZD5363 suppress STAT3 phosphorylation in PCa cells and the combind treatment shows synergistic inhibition effect. Both AZD4547 and AZD5363 promote AR and PTEN expression at both RNA and protein levels in VCaP and 22RV1cells, and the combination treatment remains the promotion effect. In LNCaP cells, AZD5363, but not AZD4547, stimulates AR mRNA and protein expression, which keep increased in combined treatment.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Western countries have 6 fold higher incidence of prostate cancer (PC). Dietary composition, in addition to other factors, may contribute to this geographic disparity. Cholesterol, the precursor for de novo steroid hormone synthesis, has been hypothesized to promote PC growth via multiple pathways including intratumoral steroidogenesis. While lowering serum cholesterol slows xenograft PC growth, this has not been tested in transgenic models, which allow testing of PC prevention as well as modulating PC growth in an orthotopic position. We determined the effect of cholesterol uptake inhibition, using ezetimibe, on PC growth in Hi-Myc and PTEN transgenic mice.Methods', ' We randomized 50 c-myc/wt (Hi-Myc) mice and 30 PTENloxP/loxP-Cre+ (PTEN) to one of two diets', ' high fat high cholesterol (HFHC; 40% fat, 17% protein, 43% carbohydrate, 1.25% cholesterol), or HFHC with ezetimibe (30 mg/kg food) (HFHC+Z). Mice were fed ad libitum starting right after weaning and body weights measured twice weekly. Prostate, liver, spleen, adipose tissue and serum were harvested from Hi-Myc and PTEN mice at age 6 and 4 months, respectively. Serum cholesterol and testosterone (T) and tumor T were measured in Hi-Myc mice and are ongoing in PTEN mice.Results', ' In Hi-Myc mice, body weights were significantly greater in the HFHC+Z group at sacrifice, relative to the HFHC group (p=0.04), but there were no differences in prostate weight between groups with adjustment for body weight (p=0.84). In PTEN mice, there was no difference in body weights between groups, but prostate weight was significantly lower in the HFHC+Z group, relative to the HFHC group (p=0.046). In Hi-Myc mice, while serum T levels did not vary between groups (p=0.93), tumor T, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione concentrations were significantly reduced in the HFHC+Z group, relative to the HFHC group (p=0.01, p=0.01, p=0.006, respectively).Discussion', ' Reduction of serum cholesterol levels using cholesterol uptake inhibitor, ezetimibe, significantly reduced prostate weight in PTEN mice consuming a HFHC diet. Furthermore, supplementation of the HFHC diet with ezetimibe significantly reduced tumor concentrations of T, DHT and androstenedione in Hi-Myc mice, although there was no effect on prostate weight. These findings highlight a potentially critical role for cholesterol in PC progression by providing evidence that reduction of hypercholesterolemia may reduce intratumoral de novo steroidogenesis and slow PC growth. This study may provide new insight into the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs for PC prevention and treatment.']",

CTCs were detected using two methods, CellSearch (Veridex LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA) and ISET (Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumor cells). Molecular characterization of CTCs was performed on ISET filters by combining four color immunofluorescent staining and Filter Adapted-Fluorescent In situ Hybridization (FA-FISH). To optimize pan-keratin detection, four pancytokeratin antibodies, including AE1/AE3, KL1, C11, and A45-B/B3, were tested on the LnCAP prostate cell line spiked in normal blood cells and on PCa CTCs enriched by ISET. Epithelial (cytokeratins, E-cadherin, EpCAM (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)), mesenchymal (vimentin, N-cadherin), PTEN, androgen receptor (AR) and Ki67 marker expression was detected by immunofluorescent staining on ISET filters according to a method we previously established. FA-FISH was optimized for the detection of ERG gene rearrangement and AR and c-myc amplification or gain of copy number. A two step method combining immunofluorescent staining and FA-FISH was established on an ARIOL automated scanner (LEICA) to precisely relocate FISH signals in phenotypically different CTC subsets.Results', ' Higher CTC levels were detected by ISET compared to CellSearch. Quantitative analysis of the intensity values for each tested pan-keratins antibodies showed that KL1 and A45-B/B3 clones gave the strongest immunofluorescent signals both on the LnCAP cell line and PCa CTCs. CTCs expressing epithelial, mesenchymal and hybrid (both epithelial and mesenchymal) markers were detected in most patients suggesting the existence of CTCs at different stages of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. The loss of PTEN expression was also observed using hematopoietic cells present on ISET filters as a positive control of PTEN expression. ERG gene rearrangement, AR and c-myc amplifications were detected. The presence of these markers within CTC subsets expressing epithelial and/or mesenchymal markers is currently studied.Conclusion', ' Several molecular markers such as ERG gene rearrangement, AR and c-myc amplifications were detected in PCa CTCs.

        "Background":"['Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa), but patients eventually relapse with ADT resistant disease. Well-characterized mechanisms of ADT resistance include AR amplification, intra-tumoral androgen synthesis, AR splice variants, and growth receptor bypass. All of these mechanisms function to maintain sufficient AR signaling for tumor growth and survival. Improved ADT like abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide (Enza) were developed to combat such resistance mechanisms associated with alterations in androgen receptor or androgen metabolism. While AA and Enza extend survival, clinical benefits are short-lived. A new form of resistance is increasingly appreciated in patients relapsing from AA or Enza, histologic transformation of prostate adenocarcinoma (PADC) to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) variants. NEPC is lethal and the survival time is less than a year as effective targeted therapy is unavailable. NEPC typically exhibits reduced AR expression, increased expression of neuroendocrine markers, and visceral metastasis in the absence of rising PSA. Of note, NEPC possesses the similar genome rearrangements with adjacent PADC cells, indicating they share clonal origin. Thus, NEPC may arise by histologic transformation of PADC. Underlying mechanisms of histologic transformation are not understood and experimental models are limited, hindering development of effective remedies. RB1 loss is common in NEPC, but rare in PADC; genetic profiling shows human NEPC exhibit elevated levels of several epigenetic modifiers. We hypothesize that transdifferentiation from PADC to NEPC in the context of RB1 loss is due to epigenetic alterations and can be reversed or blocked by epigenetic targeted therapies. We established several genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) to test the role of Rb1, and we find Rb1 loss causes metastatic progression of PADC initiated by Pten deficiency. This Rb1/Pten deficient (DKO) PADC exhibits expression markers for both PADC and NEPC as seen in human patients. Yet, these tumors are sensitive to ADT but relapse with low AR expression and acquired Trp53 mutations. RNA profiling demonstrates the phenotype of DKO tumors is similar to human NEPC. Both human and mouse NEPC is accompanied by increased expression of epigenetic reprogramming factors like Sox2 and Ezh2. Clinically relevant Ezh2 inhibitors GSK126 and EPZ6438 can restore Enza sensitivity by reversing neuroendocrine transformation. This finding has been genetically validated using short-hairpin RNA(shRNA) in vitro. These results uncover genetic mutations driving prostate cancer lineage plasticity and suggest an epigenetic approach for extending the clinical benefits of ADT.']",

Deficiency of Pten, one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer, directly triggers a senescence program critically depending on the p19Arf-p53 fail-safe pathway. We identified a novel and unexpected tumor suppressive role of IL-6/Stat3 signaling in a Pten-deficient murine prostate cancer model. Our data provide evidence that activation of IL-6/Stat3 signaling axis is implicated in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Strikingly, genetic ablation of IL-6 strongly promoted prostate cancer initiation, progression and metastasis in Pten-deficient mice. Mechanistically, IL6/Stat3 signaling regulates p19Arf-p53-induced senescence by modulating expression of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in pre-neoplastic cells. Critically, in prostate cancer patients low expression of Stat3 or p14Arf, the human homologue of p19Arf, correlates with poor survival.

Single agent response rates in PCa have been disappointing or patients relapse.  Additional analyses identified potential combination strategies.  Forty percent of patients with low TS or RRM1 harbor mutations in TP53.  Recent data (Blackwood, 2013) suggest the addition of Chk1 inhibitors potentiates response to chemotherapy in TP53-mutated patients.

        "Background":"['The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is essential for tumor growth, proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis. AKT, a central switch in this pathway, is deregulated in a broad range of refractory and primary tumors. Importantly, activation of AKT is one of the major mechanisms by which tumors escape from and become resistant to chemo-, radio- and targeted therapies. We report on preclinical studies of BAY 1001931, a highly selective and potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor. In biochemical assays, BAY 1001931 inhibits AKT1 and AKT2 with similar potency (IC50 = 16 nM) while it displays weak activity against AKT3 (IC50  1 M) and is inactive against 230 other protein/ lipid kinases. Mechanistically, BAY 1001931 blocks AKT signalling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT at both Thr308 and Ser473 (IC50 = 3.3 / 5.5 nM) as well as downstream phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (IC50 = 70 nM). The strong inhibition of cellular p-AKT translates to a selective inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Cell lines carrying defects in the tumor suppressor PTEN or oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA are most sensitive to BAY 1001931 treatment. Moreover, characterization of BAY 1001931 in a broader breast and prostate cancer cell line panel indicated strongest anti-proliferative efficacy in luminal and HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines and in androgen sensitive prostate cancer cell lines. In vitro combination profiling showed synergistic anti-proliferative effects with anti-hormonal therapeutics in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. When dosed orally in human xenograft tumor models, BAY 1001931 induced strong pharmacodynamic inhibition of AKT phosphorylation that correlated with drug exposure. BAY 1001931 was highly efficacious in multiple xenograft tumor models of different histological types with PIK3CA mutations or PTEN deletions. In tumor models predicted to be dependent on activated AKT signalling such as the KPL4 breast tumor model (PIK3CA H1047R and HER2 overexpression), daily oral treatment with BAY 1001931 induced tumor stasis or regression at well tolerated doses. Most importantly, when combined with anti-hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen in PIK3CA breast cancer xenograft models or bicalutamide or abiraterone acetate in PTEN deleted prostate cancer xenograft models, enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with durable tumor regressions were observed. In conclusion, BAY 1001931 is a highly selective, potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor with strong in vitro and in vivo activity in tumor models with activated AKT signalling and strong synergistic activity in combination with anti-hormonals in breast and prostate cancer.']",

This study is aimed to investigate whether accumulation of cholesteryl esters (CE) in PCa is a key biological process that determines progression potential, and serves as a common mechanism underlying these features.Methods The methods used in this study include', ' 1) ESI/MS-MS on 47 fresh-frozen prostatic tissues for global lipid profiling; 2) Real-time PCR on 16 fresh-frozen prostatic tissues for the expression level of genes related to the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and metabolism of cholesteryl esters; and 3) immunohistochemistry on 165 formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded prostatic tissues for the expression level of ACAT1 and LAL.Results We found that 1) prostatic concentration of total lipids was significantly higher in PCa than benign prostatic tissues (BPT), with a PCa to BPT (P/B) ratio of 2.3, p = 0.013; 2) when total lipids were stratified into groups of neutral lipids and polar lipids, only neutral lipids are significantly higher in PCa than BPT (P/B ratio', ' 3.1, p = 0.02); 3) after neutral lipids were further stratified into class of triglycerides, diglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA) and CEs, total CEs are most sensitive in differentiation of PCa from BPT (P/B ratio', ' 5.8, p = 0.025); 4) 17 out of 31 prostatic individual CE species are significantly higher in PCa than in BPT all the studied populations; and 5) intriguingly, 14 of these 17 prostatic CE individual species remain significantly different between PCa and BPT in AA population, whereas only 3 of them remain significantly different between PCa and BPT in the CA population. The real-time PCR results indicated that the expression levels of genes Pten, LIPA, and ABCA1 are obviously lower in high grade than in low grade PCa (not obviously for ACAT1). The expression levels of proteins ACAT1 and LAL (LIPA gene product) are reversely correlated with the progression of PCa', ' in prostate cancer, ACAT1 is highly expressed, but LAL is not expressed. In contrary, in benign ACAT1 is not expressed, but LAL is highly expressed. Such a reverse correlation is especially prominent in AA than CA population.Conclusion and Significance Accumulation of cholesterol esters correlates with the progression and racial disparity of PCa. Down regulation of LIPA gene and its product LAL could play major role in CE accumulation. Thus prostatic CE and its individual species could serve as racially specific biomarkers in diagnosis and in differentiation of indolent from aggressive cases of PCa, and LAL could be potential therapeutic targets for treatment of advanced prostate cancer, including castration resistant prostate cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer is sensitive to androgen deprivation at the primary androgen-dependent growth stage (ADCa). However, it invariably acquires resistance to androgen withdrawal leading to the recurrence of the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Androgen receptor (AR) activity that is necessary for the normal prostate development remains active through both phases of the disease. Even at castrate levels of androgen AR remains functional, possibly through several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms including expression of constitutively active AR variants (ARVs). The full-length of AR (ARFL) is a 110 KDa nuclear hormone receptor composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD, exon1), DNA-binding domain (DBD, exon 2 and 3), a hinge region (exon 4), and the C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD, exon 4-8). To date up to 15 different ARVs lacking LBD have been identified in human prostate cancer cell lines or specimens. It is thought that the altered biological properties of these ARVs may be, in part, correlated to the development of castration resistance. ARVs remain understudied in mouse prostate cancer cell lines; detection of only two ARVs was reported in a mouse cell line. A better definition of ARVs in distinct phases of this cancer in an appropriate mouse model should be valuable for insights into the role of ARVs in therapy and disease progression.To this end, by using cell lines established from the conditional Pten deletion mouse model of prostate adenocarcinoma, we detected low molecular weight AR protein species (50 kDa - 80 kDa) besides the presence of the 110 kDa full-length. We performed 3RACE and subsequent Sanger sequencing on cell lines derived from both ADCa (E-series) and CRPC stages (cE-series) and identified three different ARVs which we named as mARV-abc. Structurally, mARVa is analogous to the previously reported mAR-V4 and the human ARV567es which only lacks LBD domain retaining exon 1-4 followed by the inclusion of a cryptic exon 4 from intron 4 at the 3-terminal sequence. More interestingly, we identified two novel ARV isoforms (mARV-b and -c) which merely contains the NTD encoded by exon 1 before the addition of specific sequences from different positions of intron 1. Although these mARVs occur in all the murine cell lines tested, their proportion appears to vary with respect to the stage of the disease from which the cell lines originated. In cE-series established from a CRPC tumor, novel ARVb and ARVc are more abundant than that in E-series from an ADCa tumor; in parallel, ARVa displays an opposite expression profile. These new findings together with the results of ongoing experiments, including the single cell expression analysis and on their biological activities of the splice variants will be discussed.']",

Increasing evidence also suggests that autophagy is induced during therapeutic stress and is believed to promote drug resistance limiting the treatment efficacy of anticancer drugs. Our goal was to define the role of autophagy during prostate cancer tumorigenesis and determine the consequences of pharmacological intervention. We used a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer that is based on the PSA-Cre driven inactivation of PTEN to show that autophagy is induced during tumor progression and the transformation to castration resistant prostate cancer. We also report that inhibition of autophagy by the conditional inactivation of ATG7, a gene essential for autophagosome formation, does not contribute to initiate prostate cancer. However, simultaneous inactivation of ATG7 and PTEN leads to suppressed tumor progression in castration-nave and CRPC models. Additionally PTEN/ATG7 double gene knockout mice were more sensitive to targeted mTOR inhibition than PTEN single gene knockouts. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy using the lysomotropic agent chloroquine synergized with everolimus to inhibit survival of human and mouse prostate cancer cells in vitro. Despite a strong antitumor activity in vitro, the combinations of everolimus and chloroquine failed to demonstrate any meaningful improvement over everolimus alone when tested in vivo with PTEN-mutant mice. In summary, our findings demonstrate that autophagy is required for prostate cancer progression and contributes to therapeutic resistance; however, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy, using a lysomotropic agent, was ineffective in producing a meaningful antitumor benefit in an autochthonous cancer system. Our preliminary findings suggest a need for further investigation before implementing the concept of autophagy inhibition into clinical trials.']",

Selinexor is an orally bioavailable XPO1 inhibitor that represents a novel class of small molecule compounds with potent activity against a wide variety of cancers. Here we report the activity of Selinexor against Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).CRPC progression is mediated by activation of various adaptive Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling pathways. These pathways are currently being targeted by novel anti-androgen therapies such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide with favorable outcomes. However, resistance to anti-androgen therapy can be developed through deregulation of tumor suppressor pathways. XPO-1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and therefore we tested the effects of Selinexor on CRPC cells and tumors models. Treatment of the C4-2B prostate cancer cell line with Selinexor in vitro significantly inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in nuclear accumulation of p53 and p21. In addition, Selinexor inhibited expression of the tumor-promoting gene Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme E2C (UBE2C), which is activated by AR in these cells. Selinexor was also tested in tumor graft models of two patient tumors in castrated male mice. The MDA-PCa-133 tumor is an adenocarcinoma derived from a clinical CRPC bone metastasis. Subcutaneous MDA-PCa-133 tumors in castrated male mice express full-length AR and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) but lack expression of p53. The MDA-PCa-144-13 tumor is a small cell carcinoma derived from a lethal variant of prostate cancer with anaplastic clinical phenotype and does not express AR or PSA but expresses a gain-of-function p53 mutant. Vehicle or Selinexor treatment (10 mg/kg p.o. QoDX3 M/W/F) of MDA-PCa-133 tumors for 34 days resulted in almost complete inhibition of tumor growth with a 30-fold reduction of PSA (p<0.001). Treatment of MDA-PCa-144-13 tumors for 22 days also resulted in significant reduction of tumor volume (>8 fold compared to vehicle only; p<0.0047). Immunohistochemical analysis of MDA-PCa-133 tumors showed that Selinexor induced nuclear accumulation of XPO1 cargos FOXO3a and p27 with concomitant reduction in the proliferation marker KI67.In conclusion, Selinexor demonstrated robust inhibition of CRPC tumor growth and activated multiple tumor suppressors in prostate cancer cells. Selinexor is now being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with advanced hematological and solid tumor cancers, and preliminary results show adequate tolerability with evidence of anti cancer activity.

Our study begins to address how enhanced Ras signaling cooperates with combined TP53 and PTEN loss for enhanced metastatic capability. Because neither PTEN nor TP53 deletion alone is not sufficient for metastasis, we asked what other signaling pathways are required. Ras pathway activation is implicated in prostate cancer metastatic progression in comprehensive genetic analyses of human prostate tumors. We introduced a lentiviral vector expressing K-rasG12V into a non-metastatic PTEN//TP53/- adenocarcinoma cell line (clone 2). Orthotopic prostate injection of clone2/Ras expressing cells resulted in 100% pulmonary metastasis. The metastatic phenotype was paralleled by an inhibition of sarcomatoid carcinoma transformation. We hypothesized that Ras signaling modified TGF-mediated EMT signaling, which we have previously demonstrated leads to sarcomatoid carcinoma formation in this model. Multiple pathways downstream of TGF initiate signaling including SMAD4 dependent transcription and other non-SMAD mediated pathways like TAK1 induced NF-B activation. Pathologic analysis of nuclear p65 labeling, a canonical NF-B marker, showed enhanced labeling in clone2/Ras developed tumors and lung metastases and undetectable levels in clone 2 developed tumors. These in vivo findings suggest enhanced canonical NF-B signaling may enable Ras transformed prostate cancer cells with metastatic capability.']",

Four are neuroendocine, 12 are castration resistant (CR) sublines and 7 are abiraterone or MDV-3100 resistant sublines. Comprehensive characterization studies have been done on 24 lines. All lines histologically resemble the originating clinical specimen. Unsupervised gene expression array clustering analyses revealed (a) association between the xenograft and the originating clinical specimen, (b) pairing of androgen-sensitive lines with their CR sublines, (c) a distinction between adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine phenotypes and (d) insignificant drift over a 2-5 year period of serial passage.

To explore mechanisms of resistance, we are also maintaining sublines that developed resistance to abiraterone and MDV-3100.Conclusions', ' These LuCaP PCa xenograft lines are highly diverse and clinically relevant models to study PCa biology and to evaluate new treatment modalities.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of death in men across the world. Despite the initial success of androgen ablation therapy, resistance to anti-androgen therapy manifests by progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is the end stage that accounts for the majority of PCa patient deaths. Docetaxel (DTX) is an approved drug for the treatment of CRPC. However, development of DTX resistance and toxicity are the major limitations in the use of DTX in the treatment of CRPC. Now we investigated to determine whether these limitations may be overcome by combining DTX with plumbagin (PL). PL is a quinoid constituent isolated from the root of Plumbago zeylanica L. The roots of Plumbago zeylanica L. have been used in Indian medicine for more than 2500 years for treatment of various ailments. We were the first to report that PL inhibits the growth and PCa metastasis. Now we present that PL', ' 1) sensitizes CRPC cells to DTX and thus reduces its effective therapeutic dose to prevent DTX resistance and toxicity, and 2) inhibits the viability and growth of DTX resistant cells (22Rv1R). In combination therapeutic experiments, the effects of different concentrations of PL (0, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 M) alone or in combination with DTX (0.25 nM and 0.5 nM) on colony formation in 22Rv1 and C4-2 prostate cancer cells, was determined. Combined treatment of PL and DTX has more than additive inhibitory effects on colony formation. This synergism of PL and DTX on colony formation can be explained on the basis of unique mechanism of action of PL and DTX. PL-induced inhibition of PCa growth and metastasis involves inhibition of the expression of multiple targets including PKC, which correlates with the aggressiveness of PCa and plays roles in both androgen independent androgen receptor (AR) activation and promotion of PCa cell survival. DTX targets microtubules, impairs AR signaling, and inhibits cell division. To determine the effects of PL on DTX resistant PCa cells, we established DTX-resistant 22Rv1 cell line (22Rv1R). 22Rv1R overexpresses multidrug resistant protein 1 (MDR1, also known as P-glycoprotein). MDR1 is overexpressed in many tumors and thus causing intrinsic drug resistant. Transcription factor NF-KB, which is linked to cell proliferation and survival, is also activated in 22Rv1R. PL inhibited the colony forming efficiency of 22Rv1R cells which accompanied inhibition of MDR1 expression and NF-KB activation. In summary, the results presented here and the ones reported by us previously with preclinical mouse models (TRAMP and PTEN knockout mice) of PCa indicate that PL has the potential to prevent as well as treat PCa. PL is a potential natural agent worthy of investigation for prevention and treatment of human PCa. (Support', ' NIH grant CA102431).']",

Individual genomic CNV profiles obtained from 125 single cells isolated from 15 patients were then analyzed. Using unsupervised clustering, cells from each pt showed a closely related lineage structure, consistent with an evolution from a common ancestor. The degree of genomic heterogeneity within CTC from an individual pt was highly variable, with R2 correlation coefficients ranging from >0.92 (nearly homogeneous) to <0.75 (mixed populations). Two pts harbored separate subpopulations with both amplified AR and non-amplified AR cells and another displayed mixtures of genetic markers that changed over the course of treatment.

        "Background":"['Activation of AKT signaling pathway is a common aberrations in advanced castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). PTEN, a tumor suppressor is known to negatively regulate AKT function, however, in most cancer deletion or mutation of PTEN facilitates AKT mediated survival signaling in most cancer types. In this study, we have determined the clinical and pathological significance of AKT signaling in CaP tissues and CRPC cell lines. AKT and pAKT (ser473) were measured in prostate tumor tissues (Normal = 23, Grade I=13, Grade II-24 and Grade III=26) by immunohistochemistry analysis. Phosphorylated AKT is significantly higher in tumors (Grades-I, II and III) as compared to the normal/hyperplastic tissues; however, there no significant differences were seen in AKT expression between normal and tumor tissues. In CRPC cell lines, stable expression of AKT increases proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in cancer cells. Injection of over expressed AKT, CRPC cells resulted in tumor growth in athymic mice as compared to vector cells. We observed AKT tumors grow rapidly, are larger in size and showed 100% tumorigenecity as compared to the control tumors (40%), which had slow growth, as well as small tumors. Interestingly, subcutaneous injection of AKT/CRPC cells in athymic mice showed hyperplasia in anterior and a ventral lateral lobe of the prostate, which was absent in control tumors. We also found that AKT tumors are highly vascularized than the control tumors; however no micrometastasis were observed in our H &E analysis.Our in vitro studies have revealed that treatment of Withaferin-A, an herbal compound inhibits AKT activation and up regulates Par-4 mediated apoptosis by activating caspase cascades in CRPC cells. In addition, WA overcomes AKT induced resistance in CRPC cells and restores Par-4 function that resulted in growth inhibition in AKT over expressed CRPC (DU-145 and C4-2B) cells. Similarly, oral administration of WA (4mg/kg) significantly inhibited the growth of both control and AKT over expressed tumors (P< 0.001). Currently, we are observing tumor regrowth after stopping the WA treatment and immunohistochemistry analysis to confirm AKT mediated pro-survival signaling and EMT markers in the tumor tissues. These finding suggest WA could be a potent agent which overrides AKT mediated pro-survival and EMT signaling in CRPC cells, hence it can be used as a chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agent for highly aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['Recently, FDA approved the Enzalutamide as a drug for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Recent studies reported patient populations which are non-responsive to the Enzalutamide therapy. Notably, African-American patients do not fare well for the castration-therapies (Bicalutamide and Enzalutamide). To identify a new therapeutic strategy for such populations, it is very important to understand the mechanism underlying the resistance to Bicalutamide or Enzalutamide. This would involve the use of an appropriate Bicalutamide or Enzalutamide-resistant model. We hypothesized that heterogeneous sub-populations contribute to Enzalutamide and bicalutamide resistance. In this study, we generated cell models representing Bicalutamide- and Enzalutamide-resistant phenotypes of primary prostate tumor of African-Americans. We next isolated subpopulations of Enzalutamide RC-Enz; Eht-Enz) and bicalutamide-resistant (RCbc; Eht-bc) cells. The cell sub-populations were ranked into three major classes viz., (1) highly stem-cell like (expressing several stemness markers BMI1 & CD133), (2) less stem-cell like (express one stemness marker BM1), and (3) non-stem cell like (negative for BMI1 and CD133). Notably, African-American primary CaP cells exhibited higher number of stem cell-like populations than Caucasian primary (22R1) and metastatic cells (PC3). When compared, the African-American Enzalutamide/Bicalutamide-resistant stem cell-like (RC-EnzCD133+/BM1+, RC-bcCD133+/BM1+, Eht-bcCD133+/BM1+ & Eht-EnzCD133+/BM1+) cells exhibited increased rate of proliferation, invasiveness and migration than Enzalutamide-resistant Caucasian stem cell-like cells(LNCaP95EnzCD133+/BM1+). We show that RC-EnzCD133+/BM1+ and RC-bcCD133+/BM1+ cells resistant cells exhibit increased (i) promoter activity of BMI1 gene, (ii) localization of BMI1 protein on PTEN gene, and (iii) physical interaction of BMI1 tumor to E4F1 tumor suppressor protein. This was validated in prostatic tumors of African-Americans. We provide evidence that E4F1 under normal conditions negatively regulates the activity of Androgen receptor (AR)-associated signaling and inhibits growth of cells. We show that BMI1 protein sequesters E4F1 protein and inhibits its check-point type or negative regulation of AR-pathway in Enzalutamide and Bicalutamide-resistant cells. This leads to the growth of stem-cell like tumor cells during the Enzalutamide and Bicalutamide therapies. To conclude, we suggest that (1) E4F1-regulated AR-signaling plays an important role in prostate cancer, particularly in African-Americans, (2) ratio of E4F1 and BM1 expression has the potential as a biopsy biomarker for deciding the disease phenotype and (3) E4F1/BMI1 as a therapeutic target could be exploited to increase the sensitivity to Enzalutamide and Bicalutamide therapies in African-Americans.']",

Methods', ' To dissect the landscape of tumor-derived cfDNA we collected baseline cfDNA samples from 36 chemotherapy-nave mCRPC patients enrolled in an ongoing randomized phase II cross-over trial of abiraterone vs enzalutamide (NCT02125357) and performed deep targeted sequencing using a custom NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Choice panel of 72 mCRPC-related genes. 10ng of cfDNA was used for library construction and minimum read depth was ~500X. Results', ' Using a conservative detection threshold of > 2% allelic frequency, we identified a total of 53 somatic coding mutations in 36 baseline cfDNA samples, with 22/36 samples harboring at least one mutation. Mutations were highly consistent with advanced prostate cancer, falling for example in the AR (n = 5), SPOP (n = 3), PTEN (n = 3) and TP53 (n = 9). The median allelic frequency of coding mutation was 15.8% (range 2.0-74.9), with 10 patients harboring at least one mutation at greater than 25% frequency. Assuming heterozygosity, this suggests that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) comprises a majority of the total cfDNA fraction in almost a third of the cohort. Known activating mutations in PIK3CA (E545K, H1074R) were detected in in two patients, and several DNA damage repair genes, including BRCA2, ATM and FANCD2, harbored deleterious mutations and evidence of bi-allelic loss.

The aim of this study is to determine the role and mechanism of CCL-4 in the progression of PCa using in vitro and in vivo models. PC3 (androgen-independent) and 22RV1 (androgen-dependent) cell lines were treated in vitro with CCL-4 at concentrations of 0.001ng/mL and 0.1ng/mL and subjected to migration (Wound Healing) and invasion (Boyden Chamber) assays.

Real-Time PCR confirmed increased expression of MMP-11. This study shows that CCL4 alters migration of PC3 cells and 22RV1 cells in vitro. Additionally, CCL4 treatment induces tumor growth in vivo using a SCID mouse orthotopic model.

We explored AR inhibition in CRPC cell lines with low, intermediate and high AR expression in the context of PI-3K/mTor inhibition to identify biomarkers of response and resistance. We utilized no/low (DU145, PC3), intermediate (LNCaP) and high (22Rv1,VCap) AR expressing prostate cancer (PC) cell lines to evaluate anti-tumor activity with 4 pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (GDC-0980, GDC-0941, LY294002, PF-04691502), enzalutamide and abiraterone as single agents or various in combinations at clinically relevant doses. Cytotoxic activity of enzalutamide was more potent than abiraterone (IC50's was < 1M and > 10M) in LNCaP cells, however, the opposite was seen in DU145 and PC-3 cell lines. High AR expressing cells (22Rv1, VCap) were more sensitive to AR inhibition. PI-3K/mTor SMIs GDC-0980, GDC-0941 or PF-04691502 had IC50's in the range 50-500nM while LY294002 had an IC50 16-24 M except for DU145.

Combination treatments were associated with increased apoptosis (Annexin-V staining and PARP-cleavage assay) in LNCaP and VCaP > 22Rv1 > DU145 and PC3. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that enzalutamide induces G1 arrest in LNCaP and DU145 cells and G2/M arrest in PC3 cells. PI-3K inhibition induces S arrest in LNCaP and DU145 and G2/M arrest in PC3 cells. The combination of enzalutamide plus PI-3K inhibition enhanced S arrest in LNCaP while in DU145 and PC3, G0/G1 arrest was prominent.

        "Meeting_name":" Non-canonical activation of AR signaling by histone deacetylase SIRT1.",
        "Background":"['SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase, is a member of multigene family of Sirtuins. Traditionally SIRT1 is a known player in enhancing longevity. SIRT1 can target both histone and non-histone proteins to regulate diverse activities including cellular stress resistance, genomic stability, energy metabolism and tumorigenesis. Disruption of SIRT1 in the prostate results in the formation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, suggesting a role for SIRT1 in the development of PIN, a precursor lesion for prostate cancer (PCA). Paradoxically, an oncogenic role for SIRT1 was reported as evidenced by development of micro-invasive prostate carcinomas in Pten+/-/Sirt1tg mice. Therefore, SIRT1 may possess both oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities in a context-dependent manner and its role in human cancer remains controversial. To address these paradoxical findings, we examined the role of SIRT1 in prostate pathogenesis using stably silenced for SIRT1 prostate cancer cell lines. Silencing SIRT1 in androgen responsive LNCaP cells resulted in (i) morphological changes indicative of clustering and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT); (ii) significant reduction in their ability to form colonies on soft agar; and (iii) increased autophagic flux. Similarly, silencing SIRT1 resulted in reduced proliferative, colony forming and migratory ability of androgen independent PC-3 cells. Furthermore, notably, genes involved in nuclear receptor (PXR/RXR/FXR/PPAR) and kinase (AMPK, MSP-RON, and RhoA) signaling are significantly altered as evidenced by RNA-seq analysis in these cells. Remarkably, SIRT1 KD cells showed decreased expression of AR and its target genes including PSA, TMPRSS-2, FKBP-5 and PMEPA1. Interestingly, SIRT1 KD reduced PSA-luciferase activity under both normal physiological and androgen deprivation growth conditions with no significant effect on nuclear or cytosolic levels of AR. More importantly, SIRT1 KD cells showed increased sensitivity to growth under androgen deprivation conditions. Intervention with resveratrol (RES, known SIRT1 activator) reduced incidence of HGPIN in prostate specific PTEN KO mouse model with no significant differences in the expression of AR or SIRT1. Consistent with these in vivo observations, SIRT1 had no significant impact on RES-induced growth inhibition. Taken together, these data indicate that SIRT1 could potentially contribute to androgen independence, independent of classical AR signaling. Our study demonstrates that SIRT1 may not play an essential role in mediating RES-induced tumor growth inhibition and that SIRT1 may confer resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and sustains cell survival, suggesting that combination of SIRT1 inhibitors and ADT might be a potential strategy for advanced PCA treatment.

Therefore targeting AMPK and associated signaling pathways will be a promising approach for prostate cancer management. Accordingly we investigated the role of AMPK in RES-induced growth inhibitory effects using multiple human prostate cancer cell lines and preclinical animal model. These data show that RES treatment (50 M, 24 h) results in activation of SIRT1, significant inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation and cell survival in human prostate cancer cells (RWPE-1, LNCaP, C42B and DU145). The observed molecular changes were associated with induction of apoptosis and autophagy following treatment with RES. Further dietary administration of RES (0.1 and 2%) to 4-5 week old prostate-specific PTEN knockout mice for 11 and 14 weeks showed prevention of HGPIN development. Interestingly intervention for 7 weeks showed prevention of HGPIN development at lower dose but not at high dose.

This treatment-induced hypoxia (>14 days) increases synthesis of the CXC-chemokine Interleukin-8(CXCL8) co-incident with increasing oxygen tension and the restoration of tumor vascularisation1. Consequently, our current hypothesis is that hypoxia induced CXCL8 signalling underpins resistance to bicalutamide-treated tumors and facilitates the adoption of more aggressive cancer cells.Results', \" Culturing of LNCaP (PTEN null) and 22Rv1 (PTEN wt) cells under hypoxic conditions (mimicking a bicalutamide-treated tumor microenvironment) increased transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR), Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF-1) and NF-kB, inducing expression of downstream target genes associated with survival, metabolic adaptation and angiogenesis. The magnitude and duration of these responses was greater in PTEN-null LNCaP cells. Experiments were conducted to determine how bicalutamide-mediated inhibition of AR signalling would affect hypoxia-induced potentiation of AR, HIF and NF-kB transcription. Bicalutamide or an AR-targeted siRNA failed to reduce expression of pro-angiogenic, pro-survival and metabolism-associated genes. However, concurrent knockdown of both HIF-1 and NF-kB activity using gene-targeted siRNA's repressed expression of these hypoxia-induced disease-progressing genes. Amongst the genes up-regulated in hypoxic and PTEN-deficient LNCaP cells was expression of CXCL8 and its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, which we have previously shown to be regulated by HIF-1 and NF-kB activity. Potentiation of CXCL8 signalling under hypoxia was found to sustain AR, HIF and NF-kB transcription. Combination of bicalutamide with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib attenuated hypoxia-induced AR expression and transcriptional activity and decreased HIF-1 activity but failed to reduce NF-kB activity. In contrast, only direct inhibition of CXCL8 signalling was shown to repress activity of AR, HIF-1 and NF-kB in hypoxic LNCaP cells and increased LNCaP cells sensitivity to bicalutamide.Conclusion\", ' Our data suggests that targeting CXCL8 signalling may therefore be a relevant strategy to enhance tumor response to anti-androgen therapies.

It is presently unknown how ERG and ETV1 function leads to prostate tumorigenesis, and whether the factors play similar roles in this process. To address this, we focused on identification of their direct chromosomal targets relevant for prostate cancer initiation and progression. We also generated Tmprss2-ERG and Tmprss2-ETV1 knockin mouse models to interrogate the in vivo roles of these two most prevalent gene fusions. To investigate the transcriptional program regulated by ERG and ETV1, we performed siRNA silencing experiments in prostate cancer cells and overexpression studies in normal prostate immortalized cells. With the aid of a biotin-tagging approach, we also identified chromatin sites occupied by ERG and ETV1 in prostate cells. Cross-referencing ETV1 and ERG gene promoter binding to global expression profiling data permitted characterization of ERG and ETV1 -regulated programs in prostate cells. These combined transcriptional studies revealed that a common transcriptional network regulated by ERG and ETV1 but in an opposite fashion. Indeed, ETV1 enhanced the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, favoring tumor growth, while ERG showed a negative effect over the same pathway. Consistent with this, in the mouse models, ERG and ETV1 also exhibited differential regulation of common pathways', ' exogenous expression of ERG from the endogenous Tmprss2 promoter was much lower than that of ETV1, possibly due to a negative regulation of AR target genes (including Tmprss2) by ERG; however, transgenic overexpression of a mutated version of AR was able to break this negative regulation and significantly upregulated Tmprss2-ERG expression in vivo. In contrast, Tmprss2-ETV1 expression alone was able to upregulate expression of AR targets in vivo. Moreover, although ectopic expression of either ERG or ETV1 from the endogenous Tmprss2 locus alone in mouse prostate was insufficient to initiate prostate tumorigenesis in vivo, Tmprss2-ETV1 cooperated with Pten loss to enhance the prostate cancer phenotype, whereas Tmprss2-ERG failed to significantly affect the prostate phenotype induced by Pten-loss. Finally, analysis of patient data supported a differential outcome based on the presence of ERG or ETV1 fusions. In summary, we conclude that ERG and ETV1 play different roles in prostate tumorigenesis, and accordingly prostate cancers with ERG or ETV1 fusions should be considered different molecular subtypes. These findings have important implications for the development of targeted therapy for ERG- and ETV1-associated prostate cancers.']",

In solid tumours Pi3K drives tumour growth when the tumour suppressor PTEN is deleted, mutated or downregulated. It also mediates signals from specific GPCR receptors. Pi3K signals downstream of the B-cell receptor, creating potential for targeted treatment of haematological malignancies such as CLL, MCL & indolent NHL and possibly DLBCL. AZD8186 is differentiated from many other agents that target Pi3K family members as it isn't likely to impact glucose control. AZD8186 has single agent activity in a range of models, although maximal benefit is anticipated when used in combination. Loss of PTEN mediated control, and hence dependency on PI3K occurs in many solid tumour types, and is altered in up to 40-50% of tumours in some individual disease states. Commonly PTEN dysregulation is associated with other activation of other signaling pathways. To explore this we have combined AZD8186 with a number of different agents. In HCC70 (triple negative breast cancer) and PC3 (prostate cancer) xenografts combination of AZD8186 (25mg/kg bid) with single dose docetaxel (15mg/kg) gives >90% tumour growth inhibition (TGI), compared to 40-50% with docetaxel alone.

This data establishes the potential for AZD8186 to be used in combination with a number of different agents including the ability to customise dose and schedule to optimise both tolerability as well as anti-tumour effects.

        "Background":"['The majority of kinase inhibitors in cancer clinical trials have been evaluated in the context of cell autonomous induction of apoptosis. However, apoptosis can result in protumorigenic immunosuppression, which limits the durability of an anti-tumor response. Recent clinical trial data shows striking clinical and radiographic responses with kinase inhibitor cabozantinib (XL-184) in metastatic solid tumors, particularly in the context of bone metastases. However, the mechanism responsible for this robust antitumor response remain unknown. Here we show that cabozantinib eradicates poorly differentiated invasive cancer that develop in the context of prostate-specific PTEN and p53 loss, respectively, within 48 hours of cabozantinib treatment. This rapid tumor clearance was temporally associated with infiltration of mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the tumor bed. These anti-tumor effects of cabozantinib appear to be MET-independent, since the MET inhibitor PF-04217903 did not phenocopy the effects of cabozantinib in the prostate-specific PTEN/p53 deficient mouse model in vivo. Unexpectedly, in vitro treatment of PTEN/p53 deficient cell lines derived from murine tumors showed insignificant apoptosis, but robust extracellular release of HMGB1, a neutrophil chemoattractant, and marker of immunogenic cell death. To elucidate the relevance of an immunogenic anti-tumor mechanism in vivo, we performed RNA-seq profiling and quantitative RT-PCR analysis, which showed an acute increase in anti-tumor inflammatory cytokine gene expression signature and neutrophil activation/chemotaxis markers following acute cabozantinib treatment. Critically, blockade of neutrophil chemotaxis/trafficking with dexamethasone or depletion with anti-Ly6G antibody, reversed the effects of cabozantinib towards eradication of advanced PTEN/p53 deficient tumors. Finally, cytokine array profiling of supernatant from bone marrow metastases from castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients showed increased neutrophil markers and decreased IL-6 levels within the bone microenvironment following 6 weeks of cabozantinib treatment., thus polarizing the neutrophils into N1 effector cells. Collectively, these results shed light on a novel anti-tumor immunogenic mechanism for cabozantinib within the tumor microenvironment of PTEN/p53 deficient tumors, which unleashes a profound innate anti-tumor immune response. These findings suggest the possibility of combination therapies of cabozantinib with T-cell checkpoint blockade or vaccine-based approaches, to augment immunologic responses in advanced cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a robust technique when used with appropriate interpretative guidelines, and the assay can yield consistent results that provide diagnostically and prognostically useful information to help guide patient therapy. The establishment of quality control standards in clinical laboratories using routine FISH analysis of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections in different tumor types for fusion and break-apart strategies and gene amplifications have been developed for both analysis and reporting, but at the present time there are no comprehensive guidelines for the analysis of genomic deletions using FFPE sections. The use of FISH on archival FFPE samples is technically demanding and becomes more challenging when applied to paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays. The evaluation of FISH signals in interphase nuclei of FFPE sections is affected by truncation and overlapping of the nuclei due to varying cell density, tissue architecture differences and histological forms. In this study we report a generalizable four-color deletion FISH approach to assist interpretation problems arising when evaluating FISH signals. The guidelines will help address interpretative dilemmas associated with overlapping and truncated nuclei in FFPE prostate cancer sections. The four-color FISH approach was developed using the PTEN tumor suppressor gene deletion model in prostate cancer. The PTEN assay was based on a robust bioinformatics analysis of 311 published human genome array datasets and comprises a centromeric chromosome enumeration probe, a specific PTEN gene probe, and control flanking probes either side of the target probe. The sensitivity and specificity parameters of the four-color PTEN probe set were further characterized using a large number of well-characterized tumors and stringent scoring criteria. The incorporation of flanking control probes allowed the analysts to determine if the chromosomal region was subject to truncation loss. A minimum threshold for apparent deletion frequency was set to address the heterogeneous and homogeneous nature of tumor histology. In addition the approach facilitated analysis of genotypic heterogeneity and varying clonality within different foci of tumor in the prostate. Overall the approach provided robust and highly reproducible results that minimized inter- and intra-assay variability. The four-color FISH deletion assay reduced the frequency of misinterpretation and improved both the quality and throughput of FISH analyses using clinical samples. Moreover the use of established controls and conservative cut-offs for assigning deletions will facilitate more coherent approach to developing reporting standards for deletion assays as more tumor suppressor genes of clinical importance are discovered by next generation sequencing methods.']",

Mutations in PIK3CA and loss of PTEN activity lead to activation of AKT signaling; alterations in these genes occur frequently in prostate cancers while activation of the PI-3K/AKT signaling pathway is implicated in prostate cancer progression and treatment resistance. Hence, novel inhibitors of the pathway such as PX-866 are of interest.  Methods', '  In this multicenter, two-stage, phase II study, docetaxel-nave CRPC pts received PX-866, 8mg daily on a 6-week cycle. Primary endpoint was lack of progression at 12 weeks (PCWG2 criteria). Secondary endpoints included PSA and objective response rates and change in circulating tumor cells (CTC) during treatment. If 5 of the first 20 pts were progression free at 12 weeks, the study would stop.  Otherwise, 40 pts would be accrued and PX-866 deemed worthy of further study if 16 pts were progression free at 12 weeks.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) such as Olaparib and Talazoparib exploit the concept of synthetic lethality by selectively targeting cancer cells with defective DNA repair pathways. These drugs are currently only available in oral form which results in limited bioavailability, poor tumor accumulation, and systemic toxicity. Here we report the development of novel nanoformulations of Olaparib and Talazoparib to allow intravenous or intraperitoneal delivery, providing greater bioavailability and tumor accumulation, while limiting systemic toxicities.Methods', ' Nanoparticle formulations of Olaparib and Talazoparib were synthesized and tested in vitro and in vivo. Short-and long-term dose response with a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines were conducted. These cell lines include KURAMOCHI, SKOV3, OVSAHO, JHOS2, PA1, COV318, 403 and 404, derived from BRCA2-/-, PTEN-/-, TP53mut mice, and 4306 and 4412, developed from conditional LSL-K-rasG12D/+, PTENloxP/loxP mice. Radiosensitization with NanoOlaparib was tested in the radiation resistant prostate cancer cell line FK01, derived from Ptenpc-/-;Trp53pc-/- mice. In vivo, NanoOlaparib was tested in an IP spread model using 404 cells. Animals were treated IP with NanoOlaparib alone, and in combination with cisplatin. Radiosensitization with NanoOlaparib in vivo was tested in a xenograft model using FK01 cells to mimic castration resistant prostate cancer. Animals were treated biweekly with NanoOlaparib before and after radiation treatment.Results', ' The murine cell lines 403 and 404 were highly sensitive to this treatment due to the mutations in BRCA2, PTEN, and TP53. 4412 and 4306 showed comparable sensitivity, suggesting that a PTEN deletion confers similar sensitivity to PARP inhibitors as a BRCA2 deletion. PA1 demonstrated high sensitivity to NanoOlaparib which may be attributed to genetic instability. NanoTalazoparib is more potent than NanoOlaparib, resulting in a similar relationship in cell line sensitivity with overall lower IC50s. Strong synergistic radiosensitization was observed in FK01 cells with NanoOlaparib.Bioluminescence imaging illustrated that NanoOlaparib administered IP daily resulted in a greater inhibition of tumor growth than those treated with oral Olaparib daily. The FK01 xenografts are highly radioresistant with little difference between untreated and radiation only animals. NanoOlaparib delays tumor growth, while the combination of radiation and NanoOlaparib clearly shrinks tumors.Conclusions', ' Robust nanoparticle formulations of NanoTalazoparib and NanoOlaparib have been successfully developed for in vitro and in vivo studies.

The evidence for increased protein levels of B7-H1/PD-L1 comes largely from immunohistochemistry analysis of surgical and biopsy specimens. While several studies attempt to correlate B7-H1/PD-L1 expression with poor prognosis, there are studies that conclude no correlation based on technical difficulties associated with detecting B7-H1/PD-L1 protein expression on the cell surface. We were able to quantifiably measure soluble B7-H1/PD-L1 in conditioned medium from tumor cell cultures using two new immunoassays, a Quantikine® ELISA and a Simple Plex™ Assay. We show that breast, prostate, glioma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells express various levels of B7-H1/PD-L1 which correlate to their PTEN or proliferation status. This is in agreement with previous findings showing that increases in B7-H1/PD-L1 expression levels are frequently coincident with loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor or increased activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) pathway. The androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line does not exhibit measurable B7-H1/PD-L1 in any instance, while the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC-3 expresses measurable B7-H1/PD-L1 that is further inducible with PMA treatment. In all cell lines included in our study, incubation with PMA increases the level of B7-H1/PD-L1 released into the culture media, while pretreatment with the PI 3-K inhibitor, LY294002, abrogates this increase. Importantly, the Simple Plex platform is able to quantify very low levels of B7-H1/PD-L1 that are below detection by ELISA.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Gene fusion of the TMPRSS2 promoter and ERG that gives rise to aberrant ERG expression is detected in over 50% of prostate cancers (CaP). ERG overexpression abrogates cell differentiation, promotes cell invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and additional Pten loss or AKT up-regulation enhances the transformation into well-differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a calciumdependent phospholipidbinding protein that regulates cell adhesion, cellular junction formation, actin remodeling and genesis of cell polarity. Evidence from a variety of malignancies suggests that ANXA2 is vital for promoting adhesion, migration and metastasis in cancer cells. In CaP, ANXA2 expression is lost or reduced, however, is increased in high grade tumors. Microarray gene expression studies have shown an inverse correlated ERG and ANXA2 expression. We examined the cancer associated functions of ERG and ANXA2 such as cell invasion, cell migration and cell polarity in CaP cell lines.Methods', ' ANXA2 and ERG cellular localization were monitored using fluorescence microscopy. The prostate specific transcriptional initiation site of ANXA2 was defined by 5RACE. Ch-IP Assay was used to show the recruitment of ERG to the ANXA2 promoter. Cases consisting of well differentiated and poorly differentiated CaP with and without TMPRSS2-ERG fusion were stained with ANXA2 and ERG antibodies to determine correlation in expression.Results', ' The inverse correlation between ERG and ANXA2 protein expression was confirmed by ERG knockdown experiments in VCaP cells. ERG overexpression in prostate adenocarcinoma is correlated with the loss ANXA2 expression in 90% of cases examined. A subset of ERG positive tumors exhibit small clusters of cells with clonal expression of ANXA2. We evaluated the patterns of ERG-ANXA2 expression against available clinical-pathological features.Conclusions', ' Our findings suggest that the expression of ANXA2 and its function in establishing cell polarity and cellular junctions may be disrupted by ERG overexpression through the transcriptional repression of ANXA2. We hypothesize that the reemergence of ANXA2 expression in advanced tumors reflects the accumulation of genetic hits that resulted in a more aggressive tumor with higher metastatic capacity. An IHC based assay with combined ERG and ANXA2 antibody cocktail could enhance the pathological evaluation of prostate tumors discern the re-expression of ANXA2 in ERG positive tumors and improve the prognosis and treatment of CaPs.This research was in part supported by the National Cancer Institute R01CA162383 grant to S.

Here we screen for links between the clinical phenotype and molecular profile of AVPCa and corresponding PDX.  Methods', '  59 PC samples from 40 men (10 with SCC) registered to NCT00514540, and 8 PDX from 6 of them, were stained for RB, p53, AR, NKX3-1, ASCL1, AURKA, UBE2C and Ki67. We examined relationships between markers. We subjected DNA from 36 of the PC samples and all PDX to OncoScan to determine copy number alterations (CNA). We compared findings to reported TCGA data. We examined associated and downstream molecular events in the PDX.  Results', '  The 40 men with tissues available for study were similar to remaining NCT00514540 patients except for higher ECOG PS and LDH values. 67% stained negative for RB and 32% for AR. Nuclear (N)-AR showed strong positive correlations with RB, NKX3-1, N-AURKA, as did p53 with N-UBE2C and Ki67 with UBE2C. Most common CNA across morphologies were 8q24 amplification, PTEN loss (largely gene-specific) and RB1 loss (often regional). Clustering segregated samples by CNA rate and associated with Tp53 mutational status but not histology. CNA in RB1, PTEN and MYC carried the highest weight in linear discriminant analyses distinguishing AVPCa from TCGA samples. Seven of 8 PDX bore Tp53 mutations. 2 of 3 RB-positive PDX had high levels of hyperphosphorylated RB. Only AR-negative PDX expressed pro-neural transcription factors, albeit heterogeneously.  Conclusions', '  Clinically defined AVPCa of varied morphologies share molecular profile with SCC and are characterized by combined alterations in RB, p53 and/or PTEN. Analysis of corresponding PDX contributed biological insight.

It has been hypothesized that CTCs could be used as a liquid biopsy to obtain repeat molecular characterizations and provide dynamic insight into the biology of an underlying cancer. However, due to the low abundance of CTCs and technical limitations in the single-cell sequencing, it had been very difficult to characterize CTCs on a whole genome scale. The surrogacy of CTCs for conventional tumor tissues has never been demonstrated beyond targeted genomic alterations such as shared ETS fusions in prostate cancer (PC), EGFR mutations in lung cancer and BRAF mutations in melanoma. With recent technical advances in single-cell sequencing and single-CTC isolation technologies, we present the first study using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of isolated serially-collected single CTCs in a PC patient.Method\", ' By combining NanoVelcro CTC Chip with laser microdissection, we developed a robust platform for single-CTC isolation. Subsequent WGS was performed after the multiple displacement amplification of our single-CTC DNA. From a PC patient, we performed WGS on four of his CTCs on two different time point, his primary prostatectomy tissue and liver metastasis along with WBC and normal adjacent tissue from the prostatectomy as controls. Copy number variations, single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including rearrangements were identified for comparison.Results', ' We successfully performed WGS on isolated single CTCs, achieving 30X depth and >95% coverage. SNV analysis reveals that 33.5% (289/863) of founder somatic mutations (defined as mutations shared between primary and metastatic tumors) can be found in CTCs. Looking into the mutational landscape of CTCs, 48% of the CTC mutations can be traced back to either primary or metastatic tumor. Per SV analysis, we found and validated an intrachromosomal rearrangement in chr3 and an interchromosomal rearrangement between chr13 and chr15. These rearrangements are shared between both tumor tissues and most of the CTCs, but not discovered in WBC and normal adjacent tissue. At the same time, highly heterogeneous short SVs were discovered in PTEN, RB1 and BRCA2 in all tumor samples, suggesting a continuous evolution of SVs in these important tumor suppressor genes.Conclusion', ' Based on our capability to obtain high-quality WGS from single-CTCs, we validate the genomic surrogacy of CTCs by the detection of shared SNVs and rearrangements between CTCs and tumor tissues. The heterogeneous mutational landscapes of SNVs and SVs are also discovered in single-CTCs, indicating the value of our single-CTC WGS approach. We envision our single-CTC WGS approach will be utilized for studying tumor heterogeneity and the biological evolution of cancer during disease progression, even during anticancer therapy.']",

The down-regulation of Akt activation by ChK is independent of class I PI3K enzyme inhibition or the upstream mediators PDK1, PTEN, and mTORC2. The purpose of these studies was to investigate the effect of ChK on the proliferation and migration of prostate carcinoma cells of various metastatic potential and PTEN status. The activation of Akt was monitored to assess the ability of ChK to inhibit Akt in prostate carcinoma cells. In these studies, MTT assays were used to measure the number of viable PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells treated with ChK. Scratch wound and transwell migration assays were utilized to examine the effect of ChK on cell migration. To assess Akt activation, western blot analysis was performed to measure changes in Akt phosphorylation at the ser473 and thr308 sites after cells were treated with ChK or vehicle. ChK was found to inhibit the number of viable PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells with IC50 values in the 3-5M range. ChK inhibited migration of PC3 cells into the wound space at 1M by approximately 60% after 72 hours as compared to vehicle treated controls.

        "Background":"['Background', ' For cancer pts with BM, skeletal complications (SC) are common. Skeletal complications such as fracture may increase morbidity and mortality and reduce quality of life. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is an intravenous bisphosphonate (IVBP) with efficacy in reducing or delaying the incidence of SCs due to BM. This analysis was performed to assess the real-life benefit of long-term ZOL use. Methods', ' A claims-based analysis using commercial and Medicare data from a large, U.S.-managed care plan and from a database consisting of 45 health plans was used to evaluate mortality and risk of fracture in pts treated with ZOL, compared with those who were not treated with an IVBP. Pts age 18+ with a prostate cancer (PC), bladder cancer (BlC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) diagnosis between Jan 2001 and Dec 2006 as well as a BM were included. Continuous enrollment in the health plan for 6 months prior to the index date, with no evidence of BM or IVBP. Pts were followed until disenrollment, therapy switch, or end of study. Risk of fracture and mortality were assessed. Results', ' The analysis included 6,347 pts (4,976 PC, 941 RCC, and 430 BlC) with a mean age of 68.9 years (11.12); approximately 23% were treated with ZOL. Incidence of fracture was greater in the non-IVBP group (IRR=1.43, 95%CI=1.20, 1.73). Mortality was also greater in the non-IVBIS group (IRR=1.81, 95%CI=1.42, 2.35). Overall, pts who had higher levels of persistency on ZOL experienced reduced risk for fractures than those with a lower persistency of treatment (Table 1). Average time between BM Dx and ZOL initiation was between 76 (BIC) and 118 days (RCC). Conclusions', ' This retrospective analysis showed that in pts with GU cancers and BM, ZOL treatment is associated with lower risk of fracture and decreased mortality.

We assessed mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in primary and metastatic samples from untreated, hormone-treated and castration resistant pts.  Methods', '  Pts with localized and metastatic PC were enrolled on an IRB-approved protocol for tumor genomic profiling. Fixed tumor and matched germline samples were subjected to DNA sequencing analysis using MSK-IMPACT for the identification of somatic mutations and CNAs.  Results', '  135 tumor samples from 124 pts were successfully sequenced, including 83 primary and 52 metastatic tumors. Metastatic sites include LN (22), bone (12), liver (6), lung (2) and other soft tissue (10). 5 tumors were pathologically classified as neuroendocrine. Common alterations in the metastatic tumors include TP53 deletion/mutation (44%), AR amplification/mutation (38%), PTEN deletion/mutation (29%), RB1 deletion/mutation (17%), BRCA2 deletion/mutation (13%), FOXA1 mutation (12%) and SPOP mutation (8%). Common alterations in the primary tumors (67% with Gleason > 7) include TP53 mutation (20%), SPOP mutation (11%) and PTEN deletion/mutation (10%). Among metastatic samples, tumors from pts with castration resistant disease have higher CNA burden when compared to tumors from untreated or castration-sensitive pts (0.30 vs. 0.19 fraction genome altered, p < 0.05, unpaired t-test) as well as higher rates of AR amplification/mutation (50% vs. 7%, p < 0.01, Fishers exact test).  Conclusions', '  Genomic profiling of primary and metastatic prostate tumors is feasible with the targeted MSK-IMPACT assay and recapitulates findings from broader whole exome-based studies.

Two of the principal molecular mechanisms of progression to the castrate-resistant state include loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor pathway and alterations in androgen receptor signaling through mutation or amplification. These pathways contribute to increased PI3K/mTOR signaling and AR-dependent signaling, respectively, which leads to progressive tumor growth, survival, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Based on this rationale, we are conducting a single arm phase II study of the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus (Torisel) in combination with anti-androgen therapy, in order to assess the clinical activity of this combination on disease progression and changes in PSA and CTC counts. This trial is funded by the NCCN.

Biomarker development in HSPC has been hampered by the absence of primary tumor tissue in men who undergo radiation or present with metastatic disease. CTCs can address this challenge by providing real-time cancer tissue for biomarker analysis in HSPC. To test this approach we conducted a pilot of CTC capture and targeted NGS in HSPC.  Methods', '  Under IRB approval, blood samples from patients with HSPC were labeled with EpCAM ferrofluid and placed into the LiquidBiopsy platform (Cynvenio Biosystems, Inc.), an immunoaffinity-based microfluidic device tailored to query genomic events. CTCs were identified by CK, CD45 and DAPI expression. A matched WBC pellet served as a control representing germline sequence. Amplicon libraries were generated using Life Technologies AmpliSeq 2.0 and sequenced on an Ion Torrent platform. Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNV) present in CTCs but not in WBC were identified.  Results', '  CTCs were detected in all 8 patients with HSPC (CTC median 64.5, range 17-217). Germline variants were consistently detected in matched CTC and WBC samples. Significant SNVs (occurring in > 1% of DNA in a sample) were found in 4 of 8 CTC samples (range 1-5 SNVs/sample, frequency 1.2%-11.9% with 620X-14,422X coverage). Notably, 3 patients had biochemical recurrence only (no clinical metastases) yet still yielded CTCs associated with SNVs in KIT, APC, RET, SMAD4 and PTEN. One patient who had untreated metastatic disease had the highest number of CTCs which harbored 4 SNVs.  Conclusions', '  This pilot demonstrates the feasibility of using CTCs as real-time disease relevant substrate for NGS to identify personalized genomic targets in HSPC. A high number of CTCs were detectable in all patients and CTC germline variants correlated with matched WBC controls. Encouragingly, even with a relatively narrow, primary tumor-derived AmpliSeq platform, cancer relevant SNVs were detected in half of the patients including those with only biochemical recurrence, making targeted NGS of CTCs a promising approach for biomarker discovery and validation in HSPC.']",

        "Background":"['The mTOR pathway is frequently over-activated in human cancers. However, classic allosteric mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and its analogs only exert limited clinical benefits in patients. It has been shown that many tumors either fail to respond to rapamycin initially or are able to acquire resistance after the initial treatment of rapamycin. Such primary and secondary resistances remain as major concerns in rapamycin-based anti-cancer therapies that may inevitably lead to therapeutic failure. We have previously shown that the ATP-competitive dual mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 can significantly inhibit malignant behaviors however its functional efficacies in the rapamycin-resistance setting remains unclear.Cancer cells with wildtype PTEN were selected as models of primary rapamycin resistance since the mTOR pathway is usually less abnormal in these cells. To establish cells with acquired rapamycin resistance, PTEN-null prostate cancer PC-3 cells were gradually treated with increasing concentrations of rapamycin (up to 10 M) until the cells were completely unresponsive to rapamycin (PC-3RR). Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay and clonogenic survival was tested by colony formation assay. m7G pull-down assay was employed to detect the cap-dependent translation. mTOR downstream pathways, including p-S6K (T389)/p-S6 (S235/236), p-4EBP1 (T37/S46) and p-Akt (S473) were detected by Western Blotting.PTEN wildtype and PC-3RR cells essentially failed to respond to rapamycin; IC50 values were greater than 100 nM in PTEN wildtype cells and 1 M in PC-3RR cells. However, for both cell types AZD8055 suppressed proliferation at the nanomolar level in a dose dependent manner, with IC50 values less than 30 nM. Similarly, cellular clonogenic capacity was impaired by AZD8055 to a greater extent than was the case for rapamycin. At the molecular level, AZD8055, but not rapamycin, strongly prevents the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E, therefore blocking cap-dependent translation. Further, while the p-S6K and p-S6 pathway was potently inhibited by both agents, AZD8055 displayed more striking inhibition on p-4E-BP1 and p-Akt than did rapamycin in all cells tested. Interestingly, similar to rapamycin, AZD8055 slightly increased p-Akt (T308), suggesting the existence of the PI3K-mediated feedback loop. However, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin did not further sensitize cells to AZD8055, implying such feedback-dependent activation is less responsible for weakening the drug efficacy.These findings indicate that AZD8055 significantly inhibits malignant functions in cancer cells that are highly resistant to rapamycin. Such effects are likely to be associated with the deactivation of rapamycin-insensitive mTOR downstream components such as Akt and 4E-BP1, but not the upstream feedback pathway. These data provide in vitro evidence in support of future evaluation of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors in cancer models that are resistant to rapamycin analogs.']",

Unsupervised clustering revealed 15 phenotypic CTC subtypes based on digital pathology features (Type A-O). Phenotypic diversity was determined by a Shannon index of these subtypes in pt samples. Next, 856 CTCs representing each subtype were individually whole genome sequenced for copy number variation and genomic instability, to define phenogenomic single cell profile and taxonomy. Tx outcomes were associated with CTC profiles. Results', ' Pre-therapy identification of certain CTC phenotypic subtypes was associated with poor overall survival (OS) following ARSi and/or taxanes. 5/15 subtypes existed primarily in pts w/ high CTC het (84-94%, Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05, permutation test), and linked to amp of AR and cMYC, and loss of TP53 and PTEN.

The present work investigated the inhibition of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)-induced prostate carcinogenesis in CYP1A-humanized (hCYP1A) mice by -TmT. Male hCYP1A mice, maintained on the AIN93M diet or the same diet supplemented with 0.3% -TmT, were treated with a dose of PhIP (200 mg/kg, i.g.). At week 40 after PhIP treatment, all mice developed high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (hgPIN) in the dorso-lateral glands. The hgPIN was associated with elevated levels of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), DNMT1, COX-2 and p-AKT, as well as with loss of expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN, E-cadherin, GSTP1 and Nrf2 in the dorso-lateral glands. In the -TmT group, the number of glands with hgPIN (per 100 glands) was significantly lower than the control group (14.6  4.87 vs. 34.81  3.87, p < 0.01). The -TmT treatment also prevented the elevation of 8-oxo-dG, COX-2 and p-AKT and the loss of PTEN and Nrf2. The -TmT treatment significantly increased the plasma levels of -T and -T (to 1.7 and 0.8 M, respectively) as well as their side-chain degradation metabolites, carboxyethyl hydroxychromans and carboxymethylbutyl hydroxychromans (to 2.6-4.0 M, higher than their parent tocopherols). In a short-term experiment, PhIP-treatment elevated levels of 8-oxo-dG, H2AX and DNMT1, and caused gene expression changes in several p53-associated genes, including p53bp1, p21WAF1/CIP1, cyclin D1, Bax, Igf1 and cyclinG1 at 1 and/or 3 days after PhIP treatment. Dietary -TmT treatment partially prevented the elevation of 8-oxo-dG, H2AX and DNMT1. This action may contribute to the prostate cancer preventive effect of tocopherols. The presently observed inhibitory activities of -TmT against prostate carcinogenesis are hypothesized to be due to the decrease of oxidative stress and inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by - and -tocopherols, and this hypothesis remains to be tested further (supported by NIH grants CA159361 & CA133021).']",

Methods', '  This study evaluated safety and activity of DSTP3086S (0.3-2.8 mg/kg IV) given every 3 weeks (q3w) to pts with CRPC. A traditional 3+3 design was used to determine maximum-tolerated dose, followed by cohort expansion at the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Clinical activity was evaluated per PCWG2 criteria.  Results', '  As of 18 Dec 2013, 59 pts were enrolled with a median age of 68 (43-87), all ECOG PS 0-1, and with a median of 6 prior systemic regimens (71% received prior taxanes). Pts received a median of 3 doses (range 1-14) of DSTP3086S, with 14 pts (24%) still ongoing. Two patients in dose escalation (1 at 2.25 mg/kg and 1 at 2.8 mg/kg) had dose limiting G3 transaminitis. Cohort expansion started at 2.8 mg/kg (n=10). Frequent dose reductions at 2.8mg/kg led to testing 2.4 mg/kg (n=22) which had increased tolerability. The most common related AEs (>10%) across all doses were fatigue, nausea, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. There were 9 treatment-related serious AEs in 6 pts, including DVT (G3) at 1.5 mg/kg, sepsis (G5) and GI hemorrhage (G3) at 2.25 mg/kg, bacteremia (G4), neutropenia (G3 and G4), presyncope (G2), and constipation (G2) at 2.4 mg/kg; and abdominal pain (G3) at 2.8 mg/kg. Approximately 60% of archival tumor tissues from Ph1 dose escalation patients were STEAP1 IHC high (2+/3+), while STEAP1 IHC high was required in the expansion cohort.

        "Background":"['The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently activated in human cancer. AKT, a central element in the pathway, is essential for tumor growth, proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis. Activation of AKT is a key mechanism in resistance to chemo-, radio- and targeted therapies. Thus, AKT is considered an attractive drug target. Herein, we report on the preclinical profile and combinability of BAY 1125976, a potent, highly selective, allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor, which is particularly effective in models with PI3K-AKT pathway aberrations. In biochemical assays, BAY 1125976 demonstrates equal potency against AKT1 and AKT2 in the low nanomolar range (IC50  10 nM) while it displays weaker activity against AKT3 (IC50  500 nM) and is inactive against 230 other protein/ lipid kinases (IC50 > 1 M). Mechanistically, BAY 1125976 blocks AKT signalling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT at both Thr308 and Ser473 (IC50 < 1 nM), as well as downstream phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (IC50 < 50 nM). The strong inhibition of cellular p-AKT and downstream signalling translates to a broad inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in vitro. In particular, tumor cell lines carrying defects in the tumor suppressor PTEN, or oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA are most sensitive to BAY 1125976 treatment. Daily oral dosing of BAY 1125976 in human xenograft tumor models induces strong pharmacodynamic inhibition of AKT phosphorylation that correlates with drug exposure. In vivo, BAY 1125976 demonstrates dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in multiple xenograft tumor models of different histological types with PIK3CA mutations or PTEN deletions while being well tolerated. BAY 1125976 can be effectively combined with various anti-cancer therapies. In vitro combination profiling shows synergistic anti-proliferative effects with anti-hormonal therapeutics in breast and prostate cancer cell lines, which translates to enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with durable tumor regressions in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo combination of BAY 1125976 with external beam radiation results in strong additive to synergistic efficacy and significant tumor growth delay. Moreover, the combination of BAY 1125976 with the bone-targeting agent Radium 223 in a breast cancer bone metastasis model results in reduced tumor and metastases burden and increased necrotic and fibrotic bone area. In conclusion, BAY 1125976 is a highly selective, potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor with strong in vitro and in vivo activity in tumor models with activated AKT signalling and strong synergistic activity in combination. Targeting AKT might also provide a promising strategy for overcoming chemo/radio-resistance and increasing radio-sensitization and radio-potentiation.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (over 30% of all cancer in men) and the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are potent cholesterol lowering drugs. Recent epidemiology suggests that statins prevent aggressive PCa development. In previous cell experiments we have shown that statins can down-regulate nuclear Akt responses to insulin (J Biol Chem 2010; 285, 27900). We showed that atorvastatin decreases nuclear phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) levels in pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines within minutes. These effects were mediated by the P2X7 receptor, and its natural ligand, extracellular ATP, induced the same effects as statins. Our published work also implicates PTEN, PHLPP1 and 2 and other phosphatases, which form protein complexes. Akt has oncogene activity in PCa and many other cancer types, and we have now tested the possibility that the P2X7-Akt pathway is of importance for the anticipated anticancer effects of statins in the prostate. We performed SNP analysis of two cohorts of PCa patients (Cgems and Gasp). We found significant associations for SNPs in Akt1, Caveolin1, P2X7, NEDD4-1 and EHBP1 genes. NEDD4-1 negatively regulates PTEN. EHBP1 is a previously shown risk factor for aggressive PCa, and has been implicated in plasma membrane trafficking. A signaling pathway analysis (Hum Hered 2011; 71, 11) also indicated significant associations to PCa (p = 0.043). EHBP1 showed the strongest influence. In additional cell studies we employed PCa cells and found that knock down of EHBP1 or p110 (previously shown to have oncogenic activity in PCa; Nature 2008; 454, 776) prevented depletion of nuclear Akt. In further long term cell experiments (several weeks) we found that high concentrations of statins resulted in a decreased expression of p110. We also overexpressed a mutated NEDD4-1 and this treatment inhibited the effect of statin on nuclear pAkt in PCa cells (DU145). Taken together this study provides evidence for a role of a putative P2X7-EHBP1-Akt axis in PCa development. As this pathway is negatively regulated by statins it may have a role in the indicated chemo-preventive effect of statins.']",

We studied if co-administration of the oral corticosteroid budesonide (BUD) would decrease the incidence and severity of CBZ-induced diarrhea. Previously, we showed that BUD co-administration has no effect on CBZ plasma exposure (de Graan et al, PIII-41, ASCPT 2012). Methods', ' From Dec 2011 to Oct 2015, we performed a multicenter randomized phase II open-label trial in mCRPC patients [NTR2991].

        "Background":"['Podoplanin (PDPN) is a mucin like type-1 transmembrane protein consisting of 162 amino acids, which comprises a highly glycosylated extracellular domain and a nine amino acid intracellular domain. The specific expression of PDPN on lymphatic but not on blood vascular endothelial cells has established application as a histological marker for lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessels in different species. PDPN is highly expressed in tumors of different origin, including squamous cell cancers, germinal neoplasia and tumors of the central nervous system. Recently, we found strong overexpression of PDPN in human astrocytic brain tumors, specifically in primary glioblastoma multiforme (GB). Regulation of PDPN expression involves increased PI3 kinase activation, subsequent activation of protein kinaseB/Akt and the downstream transcription factor AP-1. Activation of this pathway is mediated by loss of PTEN function, consistently, mice lacking Pten exhibit elevated Pdpn protein levels in the subventricular zone of the brain tissue. Additionally, PDPN expression is subject to negative transcriptional regulation by promoter methylation in human GB and in glioma cell lines. In patients high expression of PDPN is associated with poor prognosis. Silencing of PDPN results in a decrease in proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cell lines in vitro and slows down the migration in orthotopic brain slices. Consistently, tumor formation after injection of PDPN knock-down cells into SCID mice is significantly reduced compared to tumors after injection of parental cells. These data highlight a functional role of PDPN in glioma progression and suggest targeting of PDPN expression as a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with primary GB.']",

Results', '  Baseline levels of tAR mRNA in AI were higher than AD and RV1 cells while SV1, SV7 and SV5-7 were higher in RV1 than AD and AI cells.

Conclusions', '  Inhibition of PI3K/mTOR with E increases overall levels of AR transcription that is more pronounced on SVs and uncouples ARs transcriptional activity on canonical downstream targets in vivo.

These findings are very encouraging, however the specific mechanisms of response and reasons why only a subset of patients respond to therapy are not known. The extraordinary potential of immune therapies in cancer suggests that human-relevant mouse models of cancer are required to understand mechanisms of response and to optimize therapy so that a larger proportion of patients respond.We have generated and evaluated a series of genetically engineered mouse models driven by alterations in Braf, Pten, Cdkn2a, beta catenin, p53, and Nras that reflect the genetic diversity of the vast majority of human melanoma. We have backcrossed 6 of these models to C57Bl/6, generated tumors, and isolated a series of over 20 congenic mouse melanoma cell lines.

Methods', ' A novel statistical approach for determining characteristically expressed genes (biomarkers) and optimal clustering of discretized expression profiles was applied to a published gene expression dataset of PC cell lines with variable sensitivity to dasatinib (GSE9633) and to a panel of 150 banked primary and metastatic PC specimens. Results', ' We identified 68 unique transcripts, each predicting in vitro sensitivity or resistance to dasatinib with 100% accuracy.

We performed NGS whole genome CNV analysis at the single CTC level to detect driver somatic alterations associated with CTC epithelial & AR exp profiles.  Methods', '  147 CTCs were individually sequenced from 9 mCRPC pt blood samples and classified as traditional, CK-, or small CTCs and analyzed for AR exp. CTCs were individually isolated, lysed, WGA, library constructed, sequenced, aligned, parsed, normalized, and subtracted from germline CNV. Each pt CTC CNV profile was used to identify distinct sub-clonal populations and characterize CTC genomes. The genomic alterations were associated with CTC phenotypes.  Results', '  Within each pt, 2-5 clonal populations were identified. On average, 11 CNV events were detected per CTC, with an intra-patient CTC correlation of 30-59%. The correlation increased 33% within a CTC specific phenotype (p = 0.013). The presence of mCRPC driver alterations (Amp- AR, cMYC; Del- TP53, PTEN, RB1) were predominantly in CTC subpopulations of pts not responding to tx. Overall, 59% of CTCs had a single driver alteration.  Conclusions', '  Tracking all CTC populations is important to assessing genomic driver alterations. Intra-patient CTC genomic heterogeneity is common and statistically associated with heterogeneity of size, shape, CK & AR exp. CK- & small CTCs, unlike traditional CTCs, often possess loss of tumor suppressors, and are associated with resistance. Actionable alterations may only be observed in rare CTC subtypes and represent a potential new target to delay disease progression.']",

Accumulating studies have witnessed the malfunction of many chemotherapeutic regimens and the current standard-of-care therapy, gemcitabine (GEM), enhances patient survival by only few months. Cucurbitacins, naturally occurring dietary tetracyclic triterpenoid compounds, have shown promising anti-cancer activities. Herein, we investigated the potency and anti-cancer efficacy of a novel analogue of cucurbitacin (Cuc D) in pancreatic cancer cell lines and in a xenograft mouse model. Additionally, we determined efficacy of this analogue on MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which are important regulators of genes that have crucial roles in pancreatic tumorigenesis.Methods', ' The effect of Cuc D on the growth of pancreatic cancer cells was determined by cell proliferation assay using six pancreatic cancer (MiaPaCa-2, CaPan-1, HPAF-II, Panc-1, BxPC-3 and AsPc-1) cells. Cell growth kinetic assay was carried out at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The clonogenic potential of cancer cells was also studied using the colony formation assay. Tumor suppressor miR-145, which is downregulated in pancreatic cancer, directly target MUC13. Thus the effect of Cuc D was also investigated on the expression of miR-145 through qPCR analysis. Immunoblotting techniques were performed to study the known direct targets of miRNA-145 and its associated proteins. The anti-cancer potential of Cuc D in pancreatic cancer was also evaluated in vivo using a xenograft mouse model.Results', ' Our results demonstrate potent anticancer effects of Cuc D on pancreatic cancer cells. Cuc D induces dose and time dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in a panel of gemcitabine sensitive/resistant pancreatic cancer cell line models at nanomolar concentrations (100-500 nM). It also inhibits colony formation and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, Cuc D blocks the cell cycle progression in G2/M phase and decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential in pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, Cuc D significantly increases the expression of tumor suppressor miR-145 in HPAF-II cells as observed by qPCR. Furthermore, Cuc D decreases the expression of MUC13 and its associated proteins including pAKT and HER2. In addition, it restores the expression of p53 level as studied by immunofluorescence technique. The expression of key oncogenic proteins including NF-B, STAT3 (Tyr-705) and Mcl-1 were also downregulated. The levels of PTEN and p27 (Kip1) tumor suppressor genes were increased after Cuc D treatment. Additionally, in vivo administration of Cuc D effectively inhibited pancreatic tumor growth in xenograft mouse model.Conclusion', ' Overall, this study suggests that Cuc D modulates the expression of key oncogenes and tumor suppressors, thus it can be a promising therapeutic modality for pancreatic cancer prevention and treatment.']",

The median age at biopsy or resection was 63 (25-83), 55% of the tissue came from liver, 16% from pancreas, 7% lung, 4% peritoneum, and 18% from another type of tissue. 87% of the patients were diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the remaining with another form of confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer.The most identified pathogenic mutations were KRAS (85%), TP53 (72%), CDKN2A (47%), CDKN2B (24%), SMAD4 (22%), ARID1A (10%), STK11 (7%), and BRCA2 (5%). The average number of genomic alterations (likely but not confirmed to be somatic) detected was five per patient from a panel of 320 genes. Molecular modifications that are linked to a treatment option were observed in 44% of patients. Twenty four of 144 patients (17%) had mutations in at least one DNA repair gene potentially benefiting from platinum or PARP inhibitor-based therapies, including BRCA2 (5%), ATM (4%), BAP1 (4%), SMARCA4 (3%), FANC (1%), CHEK2 (1%), and PALB2 (<1%). Other actionable molecular phenotypes observed include anti-HER2 therapies targeting ERBB2 amplifications (3%) and mTOR inhibitors suitable for patients with mutations in STK11/LKB1 (7%), PTEN (3.5%), PIK3R1 (<1%), or PIK3CA (3%). Actionable alterations identified with a low frequency (<2%) include RET fusions, amplifications of FGFR, CRKL, AXL, and mutations in NTRK3, MEN1 (PNET), and BRAF. One patient harbored the BRAF V600E mutation, prompting consideration of off label melanoma-approved therapy. Overexpression of ALK by IHC was observed in one patient who chose to enroll in a ceritinib clinical trial. Six percent of patients were PDL-1 positive, and 22% were positive for PD-1 from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting possible activity from immune checkpoint inhibitors.To date, 7 of the 152 patients have enrolled in a clinical trial, 4 were treated with an off label treatment, 67 have yet to make their next treatment decision, and 53 are known to be deceased.

        "Background":"['The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling cascade is activated in human cancers by elevated membrane receptor activity, mutation, amplification, and deletion of genes encoding components of the pathway. An oncogenic, single hotspot mutation in the AKT1 gene, G49A', 'E17K, in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1, was described in human cancers with highest relative incidence in breast cancer. The E17K mutation in AKT1 results in PI3K-independent membrane recruitment of AKT1.Recently we reported the development of a highly selective, potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor BAY 1125976 with strong in vitro and in vivo activity in tumor models with activated AKT signaling and strong synergistic activity in combination.The efficacy of BAY 1125976 was evaluated in tumor models carrying activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway by either deletion of PTEN or activating mutation in PI3K.We investigated whether BAY 1125976 can also inhibit AKT signaling in cell lines carrying an activating mutation in AKT. To this extend, KU-19-19 (AKT1E17K; NRASQ61R) bladder cancer as well as LAPC4 (AKT1E17K) prostate cancer cell lines both bearing the AKT1E17K mutation were profiled. BAY 1125976 potently inhibited AKT activation as well as downstream signaling in KU-19-19 and LAPC4 cells.Furthermore, anti-tumor efficacy of BAY 1125976 was tested in the patient-derived anal cancer xenograft AXF 984 (AKT1E17K). BAY 1125976 shows dose-dependent potent pathway activity in AKT1mut patient derived tumor model with inhibition of pAKT473 as well as downstream targets p- PRAS40 and p-FOXO3a compared to selected PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors.Continuous daily treatment of AXF 984 (AKT1E17K) mouse xenografts with 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg QD p.o. BAY 1125976 resulted in very potent statistically significant anti-tumor efficacy. All animals of these treatment groups exhibited tumor shrinkage or disease control with response rates of 88% and 83%, respectively. Furthermore, for animals treated with 50 mg/kg BAY 1125976 the delay of reaching a relative tumor volume of 600% was statically significant compared to the vehicle-treated control group.In summary, BAY 1125976 showed superior anti-tumor activity in AKT1E17K mutated models compared to PI3K and mTOR inhibitors. These results indicate that the clinical development of BAY 1125976 in patients with activating mutation in AKT could result in an innovative and more effective alternative to current treatments.']",

        "Background":"['Background', \" Analysis of CTCs from patient blood represents a non-invasive method for real time monitoring of disease status. Often, targeted therapies require prior knowledge of a patient's somatic mutational status and overall tumor heterogeneity at therapeutic decision points for optimum efficacy. CTCs are a product of tumor metastasis and their heterogeneity is reflective of tumor clonal evolution in response to treatment decisions and/or sequence. We sought to develop a method to characterize genomic heterogeneity of CTCs by NGS mediated CNV analysis. Typically, CTC detection platforms enrich CTCs by epithelial cell surface markers or physical properties in pools of CTCs. The loss of cells without typical CTC characteristics and the lack of single cell resolution may bias clonal evolution monitoring. The Epic Sciences CTC platform is a non-selective method for the detection and characterization of CTCs with single cell resolution, enabling individual phenotype to genotype comparisons. Characterization of CTC sub-populations at this level, prior to therapeutic decisions and in response to targeted therapy may represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer.Methods\", ' 2 healthy donor blood samples were spiked with 1 of 3 prostate cancer cell lines (n = 6).

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in men. While some of the causes of prostate neoplasia are subject of intensive research, the influence of genetic predisposition as well as diet and other environmental factors are not well studied. Recently it has been shown that prenatal exposure to ethanol makes the offspring more susceptible to the development of childhood cancers. However, it is not known whether prenatal ethanol induces fetal programming for prostate neoplasia. In order to test this, we fed pregnant rats a liquid diet containing alcohol, some were pair-fed with isocaloric liquid diet, or other were fed ad libitum with rat chow between gestational days 7 and 21. A group of male offspring rats were sacrificed at 7 to 8 months of age and their prostates were removed for histopathology. Another group of male offspring rats were treated with N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) and testosterone to induce prostate neoplasia. After the tissue was processed, the ventral, lateral, and dorsal parts of the epithelium were viewed under a microscope to determine whether the tissue exhibited normal histology, or abnormalities in the form of atypia, low-grade, or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Additionally, levels of various cellular proteins associated with prostate pathology were determined by immunohistochemistry. The prostates of most (77%) of the alcohol exposed animals, but not ad lib-fed or pair-fed animals, demonstrated atypical hyperplasia, atypia-dysplasia characterized by nuclear stratification, and epithelial evagination with intense inflammatory infiltration in the ventral prostate gland. Furthermore, a significant number of in utero alcohol exposed animals developed high-grade PIN, whereas control animals developed hyperplasia and low grade PIN during adulthood in response to NMU and testosterone treatments. We also found increased levels of estradiol receptor (ER)-alpha, decreased levels of androgen receptor (AR) in the dorsal and ventral prostate, and low levels of circulating testosterone in alcohol-fed offspring who were not treated with carcinogens. In addition, these rats showed a decreased level of E-cadherin and increased Ki-67 in the ventral prostate. Fetal alcohol exposed rats treated with carcinogens showed increased levels of Ki-67 with concomitant decreased levels of PTEN and Nkx3.1 in the ventral prostate epithelium. The protein data corroborates well with the increased neoplastic transformation of the ventral prostatic cells in fetal alcohol exposed rats. These results suggest for the first time that prenatal ethanol exposure induces pre-malignant lesions in prostatic cells and increases the susceptibility toprostate cancer.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Urine excretion is the primary route for arsenic elimination. The bladder may thus be exposed to higher concentrations of arsenic due to the bioconcentration of urine by the kidneys. The molecular etiology of cancer linked to arsenic exposure is complex and multiple factors have been described as playing a role in this process. Although there is extensive epidemiologic evidence of increased risk for the development of urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) associated with arsenic exposure, the mechanisms by which arsenic participates in tumorigenesis are not fully elucidated. Materials and Methods', ' To prepare in vitro model we chronically exposed immortalized normal human bladder cell line (HUC-1) to arsenic. Briefly, HUC1 cells were cultured in 25cm flask in F12K complete medium with or without 1M As2O3. Medium and arsenic was changed every two days. Cells were sub-cultured as necessary and frozen down each month for future studies. Morphology differences were monitored over the entire treatment schedule, using a light microscope. Cell growth was monitored by MTT assay. Tumorigenic properties were analyzed by soft agar and invasion assay. Expression of several key molecules of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was determined by western blot analysis. Results', ' At 6 months arsenic treated HUC1 cells started to became more rounded and had a tendency to pile on to one another. MTT was performed for each month of treatment in order to determine any changes in cell proliferation due to arsenic treatment. As expected the growth of the HUC1 cells was increased in a time dependent manner after arsenic treatment. Anchorage independent growth was evaluated using soft agar assay. Colonies were observed only in arsenic treated cells and the number of colonies was gradually increased with longer period of treatment. Similarly invaded cells were determined only in arsenic treated cells after 8 months. Withdrawal of arsenic for 2.5 months from 8 and 10 months arsenic treated cells does not reverse the tumorigenic properties. Western Blot analysis of AKT pathway genes, PTEN decreased and AKT and mTOR increased in arsenic treated HUC cells. Conclusion', ' Our study suggests that the exposure of HUC-1 to arsenic rapidly induces a multifaceted dedifferentiation program characterized by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth and invasion, a motive that is also present after the end of the arsenic treatment indicating that such a manifestation seems to be irreversible. Further studies are needed in order to delineate the molecular effect of arsenic exposal to primary urothelial cancer tissue collected from patients exposed to arsenic. Studies are in progress to understand the mechanisms that induce this tumorigenic properties and potential stem cells activities in arsenic exposed urothelial cells.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Increased MMPs activity in MDM2 overexpressing cancer cell lines.",
        "Background":"['The matrix metalloprotenases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidase and have proteolysis activity which found to impact several physiological and pathophysiological conditions including cancer. In cancer, over 20 types of MMPs promote invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and proliferation. For instance, MMP-9 is involved in many processes such as wound healing, tissue remodeling and regulation of inflammation. So far, several studies have also shown that MMP-9 is associated with poor clinical outcome. MMP-9 can facilitate angiogenesis and metastasis by releasing cytokines, pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic factors. Conversely, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) is a well-known negative regulator of MMPs which can also modulate other biological functions independent of MMPs regulation. TIMP-1 dysregulation has been shown to impact ECM integrity and potentiate metastatic ability also. Similarly, MDM2 (Murine Double Minute) has been recognized as an important multi-domain protooncogene which is overexpressed in many types of cancer and is associated with poor prognosis in different tumor types including sarcomas and carcinomas. Previously, our group reported that MDM2 overexpression is regulating MMP-9/TIMP-1 axis in LNCaP and LNCaP-MST (MDM2 transfected) prostate cancer cells. In order to further analyze the status of MMP in MDM2 overexpressing cancers the fluorescence activity assay and the zymography assay were used for measuring the activity of MMPs including MMP-9. Immunoblotting analysis were also used to correlate the expression levels of MDM2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in MDM2 overexpressing cell lines with and without Nutlin-3 (20 uM) treatment. Our results indicated that MMP activity is elevated by 97.3 % in LNCaP-MST cells compared to LNCaP. This may be possibly due to the near knockdown levels of TIMP-1 that was observed in LNCaP-MST cells. However, the Nutlin 3 treatment was able to decrease the MMP-9 levels and activity only marginally, without elevating TIMP-1 levels. This suggests that, in addition to MDM2, the PTEN loss in LNCaP-MST cells may also play a role in regulating the levels of TIMP-1 and consequently the activity of MMP-9. Furthermore, in order to verify our original speculation, we analyzed the levels of TIMP-1 in SJSA1 and GI-101A cell lines, which are known to overexpress MDM2 and impart aggressive metastatic abilities. Interestingly, the levels of TIMP-1 were found to be elevated in both SJSA1 and GI-101A cell lines compared to LNCaP-MST cells. This finding indicates that TIMP-1 may paly dual role depending on cancer types and the gene expression status in the tumor microenvironment. Further studies are required to fully delineate the interplay between MDM2 and pro-metastatic mechanisms, including the expression of TIMP-1 and MMP-9.

The prostate cancer cell line LNCAP, expressing most of these genes, was used for spiking experiments. 10 ml blood of eight healthy donors (HDs), five HDs spiked with 10 LNCAP cells and 25 MBC patients were selected for CTC using AdnaTest BreastCancerSelect (AdnaGen AG) resulting in cDNA1. Subsequently, the same sample (with removed target cells) was processed again using the same procedure resulting in cDNA2. cDNA1 and cDNA2 were gene specifically preamplified using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix according to in house designed assays. qPCR was performed using Bio-Rad SYBR Green Mix.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Median survival is limited to only ~7 months in patients (pts) with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer despite current treatments. Upregulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on tumor or infiltrating immune cells may negatively regulate immunity and contribute to disease progression. Pembrolizumab, an antiPD-1 antibody, blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1/PD-L2. Results from the cervical cancer cohort of KEYNOTE-028 (NCT02054806), a phase 1b study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in pts with advanced solid tumors, are presented. Methods', ' Key eligibility criteria included advanced cervical squamous cell cancer, failure of prior systemic therapy, ECOG PS 0-1, and PD-L1 expression in 1% of tumor or stroma cells by IHC. Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg was given every 2 wk for up to 24 mo or until confirmed progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent. Response was assessed every 8 wk for the first 6 mo and every 12 wk thereafter. The primary end point was ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment. Results', ' 24 pts with advanced cervical cancer were enrolled; median age was 41.5 y, 75.0% had an ECOG PS of 1, and 62.5% had received 2 prior therapies for metastatic disease. As of Dec 10, 2015, median follow-up duration was 48.9 wk (range, 5.6-90 wk). 18 (75.0%) pts experienced a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), with pyrexia (n =4) and rash (n = 3) occurring in 10% of pts. 5 (20.8%) pts had grade 3 TRAEs, 2 of whom discontinued pembrolizumab (colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome). No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs occurred. ORR (confirmed) was 12.5% (3/24; 95% CI, 2.7%-32.4%; all were PRs); the median duration of response was 19.3 wk (range, 17.7-52.0 wk). The stable disease (SD) rate was 12.5% (3/24; 95% CI, 2.7%-32.4%); the median duration of SD was 19.6 wk (range, 16.3-29.7+ wk). The 6-mo PFS rate was 13.0%; the 6-mo OS rate was 66.7%. Conclusions', ' Pembrolizumab was well tolerated and showed promising antitumor activity in pts with PD-L1+ advanced cervical squamous cell cancer. The clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in advanced cervical cancer will be further investigated in the phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial (NCT02628067). Clinical trial information', ' NCT02054806']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Recently, we described the conditional reprogramming (CR) which allows to rapidly establish primary cultures from normal and tumor specimens. The Combination of CR and Organoids ( (Matrigel, air-liquid interface (ALI)) cultures represents next generation human cancer models and functional diagnostics for cancer precision medicine as described in August in the NCI precision medicine initiative and three nature review articles (Nat Rev Cancer. 2015 Dec; Nat Rev Genet. 2015 Jul; Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2014 Nov.). The technique is relatively simple and has been reproduced in more than 50 laboratories (including an original and independent article in Science from Massachusetts General Hospital) (Science. 2014, 346(6216)', '1480-6.). Importantly, the CR technology can generate 2106cells in a week from small biopsies, and can generate cultures from cryopreserved tissue and from fewer than four viable cells. We therefore initiated studies to examine whether CR cultures reflected the biology and genotype of the original tumor and whether cultures might be used to predict clinical responses. Methods', ' Surgical specimens from patients with prostate and lung cancer were collected. CR and Organoids cultures were used. Results', ' We first worked out standard protocols for clinical sampling, storage, shipping, freezing and the preparation of conditioned medium. CR methods were then used to generate matched cultures from both tumor cells and adjacent normal cells from patients with prostate cancer or lung cancer. CR cultures were established efficiently from these tumors ( > 95% for prostate and lung cancer CRCs). The data with Organoids cultures demonstrated that CR cells re-expressed cell specific markers and were well-differentiated. We also characterized them for their growth properties, induction of tumors in immunodeficient mice, karyotype, and their exome and transcriptome profile. Conclusions', ' The combination of CR (2D) and Organoids (3D) culture conditions provides optimal conditions for establishing patient-derived cells and for study of translational cancer biology. These cell-based approaches should be useful for defining the functional heterogeneity of the respective primary tumors and for evaluating appropriate therapies.']",

        "Meeting_name":" A phase I study of EC0225 administered weeks 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle.",
        "Background":"['Background', ' The folate receptor (FR) is expressed on many human tumors (e.g., ovarian, NSCLC, etc.) where it functions as a high-affinity receptor for folic acid. The FR is minimally expressed in normal tissue, making it a logical target for anticancer therapy. Indeed, the relevance of FR as a molecular target for antitumor agents was discussed in detail at the 2008 ASCO Annual Meeting. Folic acid can be used as a carrier molecule to deliver covalently-linked therapeutic and diagnostic moieties to the FR and EC0225 is a conjugate of folic acid coupled to mitomycin-C and desacetyl vinblastine hydrazide (DAVLBH). The EC0225 conjugate is a high-affinity ligand for the folate receptor (FR). This phase I study assessed the safety of escalating intravenous bolus doses of EC0225. Methods', ' Eligible patients with adequate performance status and organ function that had previously failed standard therapy were treated with EC0225 on days 1, 3, 5 (week 1) and 8, 10, 12 (week 2) of a 28-day cycle. Patients in the final cohort received drug on days 1, 3, 5 and 15, 17, 19 of a 28-day schedule. Endpoints included identification of the maximally-tolerated dose (MTD), the toxicity profile and any evidence of antitumor effect. Results', ' As of DEC 2009, 63 patients had received EC0225 at doses of 0.38, 0.8, 1.1, 1.5, 2.3, 3.1 and 3.9 mg (flat dose) and at 2.3 and 2.88 mg/m2; (where n =10, 8, 4, 14, 4, 5, 4, 7 and 7, respectively). EC0225 was generally well tolerated at dose levels  2.3 mg/m2. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (all grades) included anemia (25%), constipation (17%), leukopenia (12%) and fatigue (10%). Grade 3 hypotension and Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient each at the highest dose tested (2.88 mg/m2) defining the MTD at 2.3 mg/m2. Longer-term disease stabilization ( 4 months) occurred in patients with colorectal (4, 6 mo.), breast (4 mo.) and prostate cancer (10 mo.) and in patients with leiomyosarcoma (4 mo.) and mesothelioma (4 mo.). Traditional MMC- related pulmonary toxicities were not identified in this study. Conclusions', ' EC0225, a conjugate of folate, mitomycin-C and DAVLBH may be administered safely as a 2.3 mg/m2 intravenous bolus dose on days 1, 3, 5 and 8, 10, 12 of a 28-day schedule.']",

Methods', '  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced ESCC, measureable tumor, and no prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy except adjuvant treatment were enrolled. Patients were given cisplatin 60mg/m2, paclitaxel 175mg/m2per 21 days for at least 2 cycles. The nimotuzumab was given 200mg weekly. Radiotherapy was admitted for patients with unresectable local advanced disease after 4 cycle of TCN treatment. The primary endpoints were safety and objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and over-all survival (OS). The expression of EGFR and ERCC1 were also analyzed by histoimmunochemical staining.  Results', '  Between Mar. 2011 and Dec. 2012, 55 patients with advanced ESCC were enrolled and 53 (96.4%) were eligible for evaluation. The ORR was 54.7% (29/53) and the DCR was 94.3% (50/53). The expression of EGFR and ERCC1 were detected in 46 and 31 patients respectively. The ORR had no relation to both the expression of EGFR (55.3% vs 62.5%, p=0.71) and ERCC1 (41.7% vs 58.3%, p=0.47). As a median follow-up of 15months, the median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI 8.7 to 12.3 months).The TCN combination treatment was well tolerated and the most common adverse events were alopecia (86.8%), leukopenia (84.9%), anorexia (84.9%), vomiting (73.6%), fatigue (73.6%), pain (66.0%), and anaemia (39.6%).  And 18 (34%) patients had Grade 3 to 4 leukopenia. The median OS have not yet been reached.  Conclusions', '  In this study, the ORR, DCR and PFS are superior to previous published studies. The addition of anti-EGFR treatment of nimotuzumab to standard chemotherapy was well tolerated with no serious AEs. But the expression of EGFR by IHC could not predict the outcome of nimotuzumab treatment. A phase III study of TCN followed by radiotherapy in unresectable local advanced ESCC had been designed to explore the survival benefits. Clinical trial information', ' NCT01336049.']",

Methods', ' This phase I/II open-label, dose-escalation study assesses the safety and tolerability of oral twice-daily (BID) TAK-700 in patients (pts) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy, as shown by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and TAK-700 pharmacokinetics (PK). Here we report the phase I portion of the study. Results', ' 26 pts (median age 70 y, 11 had received prior ketoconazole) received TAK-700 at 5 dose levels', ' 100 (3 pts), 200 (3), 300 (3), 400 (6) or 600 (5) mg BID; a further 6 pts received TAK-700 400 mg BID plus prednisone 5 mg BID. At data cut-off (29 Dec 2009), 11 pts remain on study; 15 patients discontinued, including 6 due to adverse events (AEs), 4 due to radiologic disease progression, 2 due to PSA progression, 2 due to patient request and 1 for other reasons. All pts experienced 1 treatment-emergent AE (TEAE); 92% were drug-related and 54% were grade 3. The most common TEAE was fatigue (17 pts, 3 grade 3 with 600 mg BID), followed by non-dose-related GI events such as nausea (11 pts, 1 grade 3), constipation (10), anorexia (9) and vomiting (7, 2 grade 3). Preliminary PK analysis indicates approximate dose- proportional increases in single- and multiple-dose Cmax and AUC0-8hr over the 100-600 mg BID dose range. Multiple-dose PK are consistent with the single-dose PK. At 4 wks, median testosterone and DHEA-S levels had decreased from 5.5 to 0.6 ng/dL and 50.0 g/dL to below quantifiable levels, respectively, in all patients treated with TAK-700. All patients treated with 300 mg had a PSA decrease; of 15 pts who received TAK-700 300 mg for 3 cycles and had a 3-month PSA determination, 12 (80%) had PSA reductions 50% and 4 (27%) had reductions 90%. Conclusions', ' TAK-700 300 mg BID appears active and well tolerated in pts with mCRPC. The phase II portion of the study is ongoing (31 pts enrolled by data cut-off) and will further assess the safety and efficacy of TAK-700 and the need for concomitant prednisone.']",
