Because c-kit expression has been reported in adenoid cystic carcinoma of various anatomic sites, we evaluated BACC for c-kit by immunohistochemical analysis, comparing the findings to similarly stained mimickers. Tested cases included 6 BACCs, 15 low-grade infiltrating ductal carcinomas (LGIDCs) chosen as potential mimickers, and 15 head-neck adenoid cystic carcinomas (HNACCs). All BACCs showed plasma membranous and cytoplasmic staining equal to or greater than that of adjacent benign epithelium. Five BACCs (83%) expressed c-kit in more than 50% of tumor cells. Only 2 of 15 LGIDCs expressed low-intensity, focal c-kit staining. Of the 15 HNACCs, 10 (67%) expressed c-kit. Hormone receptors were consistently negative in BACCs. All BACCs expressed c-kit, whereas LGIDCs infrequently expressed low-intensity c-kit. Immunohistochemical evaluation for c-kit might aid in accurately classifying carcinomas with histologic features overlapping adenoid cystic carcinoma and LGIDC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast represents a unique clinicopathologic entity with a variable histological appearance and a relatively indolent clinical course in most of the cases. Adenoid cystic carcinoma may be difficult to differentiate from infiltrating duct carcinomas, and in particular from tubular and cribriform carcinomas, especially in core or vacuum-assisted biopsies. We evaluated the prevalence of c-kit, p63, and e-cadherin immunoreactivity in a series of 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas, comparing the results with those obtained in a series of infiltrating tubular carcinomas and infiltrating cribriform carcinomas. The hormone receptor status, proliferation labeling index, and HER/2 immunoreactivity had been previously investigated in all the cases. Three (15%) adenoid cystic carcinomas and all infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas showed estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor immunoreactivity (P < 0.00001 for estrogen and P = 0.00002 for progesterone receptors). Adenoid cystic carcinomas consistently lacked any immunoreactivity for HER/2, whereas three (15%) infiltrating and cribriform carcinomas showed weak and incomplete membrane staining (P = 0.23077). Membranous immunoreactivity for c-kit was found in all except one (predominantly basaloid) adenoid cystic carcinomas (95%), and in none of the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas (P < 0.00001). Nuclear immunoreactivity for p63 was found in all except three (predominantly basaloid) adenoid cystic carcinomas (85%) and in none of the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas (P < 0.00001). All infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas and 18/20 (90%) adenoid cystic carcinomas showed immunoreactivity for e-cadherin (P = 0.48718). In summary, adenoid cystic carcinomas showed the following phenotype: estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-/c-kit+/p63+ (13 cases, 65%), estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor/c-kit+/p63- (three cases, 15%), estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-/c-kit-/p63+ (one case, 5%), estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+/c-kit+/p63+ (two cases, 10%), and estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor-/c-kit+/p63+ (one case). By contrast, all the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas showed the estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+/c-kit-/p63- phenotype. Our data provide evidence that immunoreactivity for c-kit and/or p63 may be useful in differentiating adenoid cystic carcinomas from other types of breast cancer.",

Recently, a single adnexal adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) was reported to demonstrate KIT expression, however, examination of KIT expression or c-kit mutation in ACC of salivary glands has not been performed. We examined archival tissue samples from 30 ACC of major and minor salivary glands for KIT protein expression by immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal antibody and c-kit gene mutation by polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing. KIT protein expression was noted in 90% of ACCs. An association between the presence of at least 50% KIT positive neoplastic cells and Grade 3 ACC or a solid growth pattern was observed (P < .05). KIT expression in normal or nonneoplastic salivary gland tissue was absent. No c-kit juxtamembrane domain (exon 11) or phosphotransferase domain (exon 17) mutations were found in any of the tumors examined.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is characterized by persistent, relentless growth and a high rate of eventual metastasis. In contrast, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) has a much lower risk of recurrence and rarely metastasizes. The histologic patterns of these two neoplasms can be similar. Expression of c-kit, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, has recently been reported to be expressed in ACC but not PLGA. Expression of galectin-3, a nonintegrin beta-galactosidase-binding lectin, has been reported to be significant in PLGA and decreased in ACC.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 9 ACC and 14 PLGA were immunostained for c-kit and galectin-3. Cases were scored as 1+ (5-25% positive), 2+ (26-50% positive), or 3+ (>50% positive). C-kit was expressed by 100% of ACC (3+: 7 cases; 2+: 1 case; 1+: 1 case) and by 57% of PLGA (2+: 2 cases; 1+: 6 cases). In all but one ACC, c-kit expression was confined to the inner cell layer. C-kit expression was also noted in the intercalated duct epithelium of the salivary glands and the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland. Galectin-3 was expressed in 8 of 9 cases of ACC and 14 of 14 cases of PLGA. The results of this, the first study to compare c-kit and galectin-3 expression in ACC and PLGA, suggest that c-kit expression characterizes ACC, but not PLGA. Galectin-3 immunohistochemistry does not have a role in the differentiation of ACC and PLGA. C-kit immunostaining may be a valuable adjunctive tool for this differential diagnosis, particularly in the setting of a limited biopsy. Our finding of different patterns of c-kit expression in tubular and solid variants of ACC supports the concept of solid variant ACC as a high-grade tumor, with progression toward an entirely \"inner cell\" phenotype.",

The diagnosis may be even more challenging in needle core biopsies. Immunohistochemical expression of p63 and c-kit distinguishes adenoid cystic carcinoma from invasive cribriform carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. A formal comparison of the immunophenotype of adenoid cystic carcinoma to collagenous spherulosis has not been reported. Of concern is the overlap in myoepithelial markers between these two entities. Both may express S100, smooth muscle actin, and p63. This overlap may cause diagnostic confusion yet is under-emphasized in the literature. The expression profile of newer myoepithelial markers has not been studied in this setting. We evaluated smooth muscle actin, p63, calponin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, as well as c-kit, in nine cases of cribriform pattern adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in comparison to 12 cases of collagenous spherulosis. Both entities strongly expressed p63 and smooth muscle actin; in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the basaloid myoepithelial-like tumor cells expressed these markers, but the ductular epithelial cells did not. Neither calponin nor smooth muscle myosin heavy chain was expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma but both were strongly expressed in collagenous spherulosis. Whereas the ductular epithelial cells of adenoid cystic carcinoma were positive for c-kit in all cases, collagenous spherulosis was negative for c-kit. Positive p63 expression by a cribriform breast lesion is not sufficiently specific to confirm a diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma. A broader panel that includes calponin or smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and c-kit is required to exclude collagenous spherulosis in settings in which the distinctive morphologic features that separate these entities are not conspicuously present. Reliance on p63 or smooth muscle actin alone poses a potential diagnostic pitfall in evaluating cribriform breast lesions.",

We analyzed 27 sporadic ACC tumor specimens to examine the biologic and clinical significance of c-Kit activation. Mutational analysis revealed expression of wild-type c-Kit in all, eliminating gene mutation as a cause of activation. Because stem cell factor (SCF) is c-Kit's sole ligand, we analyzed its expression in the tumor cells and their environment. Immunohistochemistry revealed its presence in c-Kit-positive tumor cells, suggesting an activation of autocrine signaling. We observed a significant induction of ERK1/2 in the cells. SCF staining was also found in other types of non-cancerous cells adjacent to tumors within salivary glands, including stromal fibroblasts, neutrophils, peripheral nerve, skeletal muscle, vascular endothelial cells, mucous acinar cells, and intercalated ducts. Quantitative PCR showed that the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression distinguished ACCs from normal salivary tissues and was cross-correlated with short-term poor prognosis. Expression levels of SCF and c-Kit were highly correlated in the cases with perineural invasion. These observations suggest that c-Kit is potentially activated by receptor dimerization upon stimulation by SCF in ACC, and that the highest quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression could be a predictor of poor prognosis. Our findings may support an avenue for c-Kit-targeted therapy to improve disease control in ACC patients harboring the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression. ",

We wanted to evaluate clinical value of the KIT mutation and protein expression in ACC.;We analyzed 33 cases of ACC. Gene mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 were analyzed using paraffin-embedded tissue, and two different sets of primers with direct sequencing after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for exon 9, 11, 13, and 17, and cloning of PCR products for exon 11. KIT protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between clinicopathological findings and these biomarkers was analyzed.;No KIT mutation was observed in all of the 33 cases. With one primer set, KIT mutation was found in nine of 33 cases (27.3%). However, these mutations were not reproducible in the experiment using another primer set. KIT protein overexpression was detected in 22 of 33 patients (66.7%). KIT protein expression was not statistically correlated with either clinicopathological factors or survival. Patients with metastasis showed a tendency of longer progression-free survival (P = 0.052) and overall survival (P = 0.080) when the tumor overexpressed KIT protein.;This study supports that mutational study using paraffin-embedded tissue should be interpreted with great caution. KIT gene mutation is very rare in ACC, and gene mutation is not the cause of protein overexpression. KIT protein expression may have a potential value for better prognostic factor in patients with metastasis.",

Although these neoplasms exhibit nearly similar histologic patterns, their biologic behavior is significantly different. This study was carried out in an attempt to overcome the histological overlap between these tumors using immunohistochemical method for c-kit and galectin-3 proteins on twenty cases of salivary gland tumors including twelve ACC and eight PLGA. Results revealed positive cytoplasmic reactivity for c-kit in 100% of ACC cases and only in 25% of PLGA. On the other hand, galectin-3 expression was observed in 100% of both ACC and PLGA cases. Moreover, solid variant of ACC showed overexpression of both proteins than cribriform and tubular subtypes. Significant positive correlation between the two studied proteins in ACC and PLGA was also observed (p < 0.05). Upon these results, over expression of c-kit and galectin-3 in ACC cases supports the concept of solid variant as a high-grade tumor. Moreover, c-kit may be used as a helpful marker to distinguish ACC from PLGA in cases where the diagnosis can be challenging. ",

This study reports an opposite finding: we have found strong evidence that the MAPK pathway is inhibited in a subset of adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the salivary glands. ACC tumors consistently overexpress the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-Kit, which has been considered a therapeutic target. We performed mutational analysis of the c-Kit gene (KIT in 17 cases of ACC and found that 2 cases of ACC had distinct missense mutations in KIT at both the genomic DNA and messenger RNA levels. These mutations caused G664R and R796G amino acid substitutions in the kinase domains. Surprisingly, the mutations were functionally inactive in cultured cells. We observed a significant reduction of MAPK (ERK1/2) activity in tumor cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. We performed further mutational analysis of the downstream effectors in the c-Kit pathway in the genes HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN. This analysis revealed that two ACC tumors without KIT mutations had missense mutations in either KRAS or BRAF, causing S17N K-Ras and V590I B-Raf mutants, respectively. Our functional analysis showed that proteins with these mutations were also inactive in cultured cells. This is the first time that MAPK activity from the RTK signaling has been shown to be inhibited by gene mutations during tumor development. Because ACC seems to proliferate despite inactivation of the c-Kit signaling pathway, we suggest that selective inhibition of c-Kit is probably not a suitable treatment strategy for ACC.",

According to this new biological classification, the objectives of our study were to assess the clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in order to classify this subtype of breast carcinoma. A total of 18 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma were identified from the Institut Curie files. Clinical information was available for 16 patients with a median follow-up of 6.5 years. Morphologically, all tumors were graded according to the system defined by Kleer and Oberman (histologic and nuclear grade). Immunophenotype was assessed with anti-ER, PR, HER-2, KIT, basal (CK5/6) and luminal cytokeratins (CK8/18) and p63 antibodies. One out of 18 tumors was nuclear grade 1 (16%), nine were nuclear grade 2 (50%) and eight were nuclear grade 3 (44%). All cases were estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2 negative. Epithelial cells were strongly positive around glandular lumina with one or both cytokeratins, identifying the coexistence of CK5/6+ cells, CK5/6 and CK8/18+ cells, CK8/18+ cells and p63+ cells. All cases (100%) were also KIT positive. In all, 15 patients were treated by surgery. Nine of them received adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up was available for 16 patients. In all, 14 patients were alive. Two of them, initially treated by surgery only, presented a local recurrence. Two patients died (one of them treated by radiation therapy only died from her disease). Our study shows that adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a special, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2 negative and highly KIT-positive, basal-like breast carcinoma, associated with an excellent prognosis. This highly specific immunophenotype could be useful to differentiate adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast from other subtypes of breast carcinoma such as cribriform carcinoma.",

ACC is uniquely formed of dual epithelial and myoepithelial cells that give rise to different phenotypic patterns. We hypothesize that the dual myoepithelial/ epithelial composition of ACCs underlie their biological heterogeneity and may impact on their therapeutic management. A recurrent reciprocal translocation of t(6;9)(q22-23; p23-24) resulting in fusion gene partners comprising MYB gene the transcription factor NFIB has been reported in ACC of breast, salivary, lachrymal and ceruminal glands. In fusion positive and a subset of fusion negative ACCs, high expression of the transcript Myb was found. However, the role of Myb protein expression and the potential effect on the downstream targets have not been investigated. To investigate the biological and prognostic significance of use of elevated levels of Myb and its downstream target genes (c-kit, cox-2, bcl-2), we analyzed, by immunohistochemistry, the protein expression of these genes in 156 ACCs. We have found that 55% of ACCs have increased Myb expression mainly confined to myoepithelial cells. We validated Myb expression on a large cohort of ACCs (156 patients). Although no significant effects of the individual Myb and downstream targets c-kit, bcl-2 and cox-2 on survival was noticed, the combinations survival curve for Myb+/c-kit+/cox-2+ showed better survival than combination Myb-/c-kit+/cox-2+. Myb may serve as a new target for the management of this disease, and future therapeutic trials of these tumors may be better based on biomarker stratification and the cellular composition of these tumors.",

One exhibited typical histological image of adenoid cystic carcinoma, the other one showed the image of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of salivary gland, and support the diagnosis of biphasic malignant adenomyoepithelioma. Transition between the two lobules was gradual. Immunohistochemically, CK18 and P63 highlighted the epithelial and myoepithelial cells respectively in both lesions. CD117 was positive in the epithelial cells of adenoid cystic carcinoma, but was totally negative in malignant adenomyoepithelioma.;This report is, to our knowledge, the first case that combines these two tumors in a single mass. In addition, we present a review of the literature. The histogenesis of these tumors is also discussed.;The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://med.motic.com/MoticGallery/Slide?id=D562817E-23C2-4F72-9823-86EF6DA40005&user=2C69F0D6-A478-4A2B-ABF0-BB36763E8025 and http://med.motic.com/MoticGallery/Slide?id=38BB7126-6FFB-4B66-A208-B8C0F528DCA8&user=2C69F0D6-A478-4A2B-ABF0-BB36763E8025.",

The stains were interpreted semi-quantitatively.Staining for CD43 and CD117 was significantly more common in ACC than in BCC. Forty percent of ACCs showed staining for CD43, while no cases of BCC were positive. CD117 was positive in all cases of ACC, with 93% showing moderate or strong staining.

The most significant aspect of this treatment approach is the proof that head and neck cancers are suitable for targeted therapies as has been shown in other malignancies. Unfortunately, there are other rare histologic types of head and neck cancer such as adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. The latter has traditionally been considered to be chemotherapy resistant and surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy has been the rule as far as treatment is concerned. The course of adenoid cystic carcinoma ranges from indolent to aggressive; however, most patients succumb to the disease as a result of distant metastases. This clinical scenario poses a challenge to oncologists. Several conventional chemotherapy regimens and novel targeted agents have been tried in this rare histologic subtype without success.;In this case report, we present a 59-year-old Caucasian female with refractory adenoid cystic carcinoma of the maxilla metastatic to the lung that responded to sorafenib, a novel multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which targets angiogenesis, Raf kinase pathway, platelet-derived growth factor Ret, and c-Kit.;This case illustrates the possibility that this chemoresistant tumor may need the inhibition or blocking of several oncogenic pathways.

Oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization has been applied for cataloging genomic copy number alterations (CNAs) in 17 frozen salivary or bronchial tumors. Only four whole chromosome CNAs were found, and most cases had 2-4 segmental CNAs. No high level amplification was observed. There were recurrent gains at 7p15.2, 17q21-25, and 22q11-13, and recurrent losses at 1p35, 6q22-25, 8q12-13, 9p21, 12q12-13, and 17p11-13. The minimal region of gain at 7p15.2 contained the HOXA cluster. The minimal common regions of deletions contained the CDKN2A/CDKN2B, TP53, and LIMA1 tumor suppressor genes. The recurrent deletion at 8q12.3-13.1 contained no straightforward tumor suppressor gene, but the MIRN124A2 microRNA gene, whose product regulates MMP2 and CDK6. Among unique CNAs, gains harbored CCND1, KIT/PDGFRA/KDR, MDM2, and JAK2. The CNAs involving CCND1, MDM2, KIT, CDKN2A/2B, and TP53 were validated by FISH and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Although most tumors overexpressed cyclin D1 compared with surrounding glands, the only case to overexpress MDM2 had the corresponding CNA. In conclusion, our report suggests that ACC is characterized by a relatively low level of structural complexity. Array CGH and immunohistochemical data implicate MDM2 as the oncogene targeted at 12q15. The gain at 4q12 warrants further exploration as it contains a cluster of receptor kinase genes (KIT/PDGFRA/KDR), whose products can be responsive to specific therapies.",

The median age was 61 years (range: 32 to 72 y) with a male predominance (male to female ratio of 1.75:1). The most commonly involved sites were sinonasal (4/11) and submandibular (4/11). Lymph nodes were pathologically positive in 4/7 (57.1%) cases. Distant metastases to the lung (n=2) and soft tissue of the shoulder (n=1) were observed. Five of 9 patients (55.6%) died, all within 5 years with a median overall survival of 12 months. Histologically, ACC with high-grade transformation was distinguished from conventional ACC by nuclear enlargement and irregularity, higher mitotic counts, and the loss of the biphasic ductal-myoepithelial differentiation. Useful supportive criteria were prominent comedonecrosis and fibrocellular desmoplasia. The most common morphologies for the high-grade component were poorly differentiated cribriform adenocarcinoma and solid undifferentiated carcinoma. Micropapillary and squamoid patterns were occasionally present. Ki-67 and p53 labeling indices were elevated in the high-grade components, though c-kit and cyclin-D1 were not.

Mucin stains showed that the tumor cells and tubular lumens contained acidic mucin. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/3, CK34BE12, CK5/6, CK7, CK14, p63, alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), S100 protein, p53, Ki-67 (labeling 85%), KIT, PDGFRA and CD56.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a valuable technique in the diagnosis of GIST and may allow for preoperative therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Because of the morphologic diversity of these tumors, routine diagnosis of GIST often relies on C-Kit immunohistochemical staining in addition to morphologic findings. However, up to 15% of GISTs are C-Kit negative. Antibodies with increased sensitivity and specificity for detection of C-Kit-negative GIST cases may be of value, especially because some of these cases may also benefit from TKI therapy.;Immunohistochemical staining for DOG-1, C-Kit (CD117) and protein kinase C theta (PKCθ) was performed on FNA cell-block preparations representing 30 GISTs, 17 leiomyosarcomas, 16 melanomas, 16 schwannomas, 11 adenoid cystic carcinomas, and 8 leiomyomas.;DOG-1 was found to have 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in diagnosis of GIST. C-Kit demonstrated 70% sensitivity and 76% specificity, and PKCθ showed 40% sensitivity and 86% specificity. When only spindle-cell neoplasms were considered (adenoid cystic carcinomas excluded), the specificity of C-Kit increased to 89%. Of interest, all C-Kit-negative cases showed DOG-1 positivity.;DOG-1 was the most sensitive and specific of the 3 markers for the diagnosis of GIST in cell-block preparations and may be of particular use in the diagnosis of C-Kit-negative GIST.",

Primary cutaneous ACC has an excellent prognosis compared with salivary or lacrimal ACC. Activation of MYB by gene fusion or other mechanisms has been found in salivary, breast, and lacrimal ACCs but has not been described in cutaneous ACC. We analyzed the histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 19 primary cutaneous ACCs, 2 periorbital ACCs, and 12 salivary gland ACCs and assessed for MYB activation in primary cutaneous ACC by immunohistochemistry and molecular methods. The presence of perineural invasion differed significantly among ACCs of various sites (83% salivary, 50% eyelid, 11% skin, P=0.0002). Over 90% of all ACCs were grade 1 or 2 and exhibited diffuse (>50%) positivity with CD117, SOX-10, and smooth muscle actin immunostains. CK15 and vimentin showed diffuse positivity in 36% and 57% of cutaneous ACCs, respectively, and were negative or only focally positive in all salivary ACCs (P=0.04 and 0.002). Six of the 11 cutaneous and periorbital ACCs tested with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization had MYB rearrangements including 2 cases that expressed MYB-NFIB fusion transcripts. Diffuse expression of MYB protein assessed by immunostaining was present in 8 of 9 cutaneous ACCs, including cases both with and without MYB rearrangements. These results indicate that cutaneous ACCs possess the same types of MYB alterations as ACCs of other anatomic sites. Vimentin and CK15 appear to have some discriminatory value in differentiating between primary cutaneous and salivary gland ACCs. ",

These special histologic subtypes are characteristically negative for ER, PR, and HER2 (triple negative), and include adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. Approximately 75% of triple-negative breast carcinomas belong to the basal-like subtype by gene expression profiling. Immunohistochemical panels that include basal-like markers such as EGFR, CK5/6, p-cadherin, p63, and c-kit provide useful surrogates to gene expression arrays for classification of triple-negative breast cancers into the basal-like subtype. The purpose of this study was to explore the expression of these markers in salivary gland-like tumors of the breast.;Excisional specimens from 10 untreated invasive triple-negative mammary carcinomas with salivary gland-like morphologies were evaluated for the immunohistochemical expression of EGFR, CK5/6, p-cadherin, p63, and c-kit using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and the L-SAB detection method.;On the basis of morphology, 5 carcinomas were classified as adenoid cystic, 3 as mucoepidermoid, and 2 as polymorphous low grade. All of the adenoid cystic carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas showed strong and diffuse expression of CK5/6, p-cadherin, and p63.

Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 40 benign and 57 malignant salivary gland tumours were retrieved and retrospectively studied immunohistochemically using a polyclonal C-KIT antibody in an Envision/HRP technique. In addition five samples of chronic submandibular sialadenitis, five normal minor salivary glands and parotid or submandibular gland tissue adjacent to benign tumour were also studied. C-KIT expression was observed in cases of adenoid cystic, acinic cell polymorphous low grade, epithelial-myoepithelial, carcinosarcoma and basal cell adenocarcinomas, as in luminal cells of pleomorphic adenomas, in serous acinar and only in intercalated and a small number of striated ductal cells of inflammatory salivary gland tissue, whereas normal salivary lobules were generally negative except a weak positivity of intercalated cells. Contrary to other reports, this study suggests that, C-KIT protein does not appear to be an exclusively specific marker for benign or malignant salivary gland neoplasms, but may be useful in differential diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma from polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma.

Thymic basaloid carcinoma (thymic BC) is a particularly rare subtype, with less than 20 cases published in the English literature, mostly in the form of individual case reports. In this study, we present the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 12 new cases of thymic BC. There were 10 (83%) men and 2 (17%) women. Ages at the time of initial diagnosis ranged from 34 to 77 years (mean 55 y). The 2 most common manners of presentation were dyspnea on exertion (3 patients) and as an incidental finding on radiographic imaging (2 patients). Tumors ranged in size from 4.4 to 17 cm (mean 10.1 cm). One of 12 cases (8.3%) was associated with a multilocular thymic cyst. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 8 cases. Pan-cytokeratin was positive in all cases. CD117 (c-kit) was positive in 6 of 8 cases (75%), p63 was positive in 7 of 8 cases (88%), p53 was positive in 7 of 8 cases (88%), ranging from <10% to 90%, CD5 was focally positive in 3 of 8 cases (38%), collagen type IV was positive in 4 of 8 cases (50%), and proliferative index, as estimated by Ki67, ranged from <1% to approximately 15%. In 1 of 2 cases with sarcomatoid differentiation, Ki67 was greater than 80% in the sarcomatoid area.

PCACC has in most cases a rather indolent course but can produce local recurrences and, more rarely, regional (lymph node) and distant (pulmonary) metastases. We report herein a Greek woman with a long-standing PCACC that grew slowly over several years and produced metastasis in the regional lymph nodes, highlighting the potentially aggressive course of this tumor. The primary and metastatic tumors were studied immunohistochemically and proved to express several (sweat gland-related) antigens (such as keratin 7, epithelial membrane antigen, CD10, and CD117) but neither hormonal receptors nor p63 or Gross Cystic disease Fluid Protein 15.

On cryopreserved material, we analyzed the expression/activation status of TRK-A, HER-2/neu, and KIT receptors by means of immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis experiments, and the presence of their cognate ligands by means of Western blot analysis and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 9 SDCs, 12 ACCs, and 8 normal glands. The amplification status of HER-2/neu was also investigated by means of fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis on fixed material. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-deregulated profile of the SDCs was characterized by the overexpression of activated TRK-A in the presence of its ligand, and the overexpression of HER-2/neu sustained by gene amplification. The RTK signature of the ACCs was represented by the overexpression of activated KIT and TRK-A and their cognate ligands, and the overexpression of activated HER-2/neu, in the absence of gene amplification, possibly sustained by epidermal growth factor receptor heterodimerization. In conclusion, SDCs and ACCs, although sharing TRK-A autocrine loop activation, have different pathologically activated RTK-deregulated profiles that may be potential targets for pharmacological RTK inhibitors.",

Immunohistochemistry was performed for Ki-67, P53, C-KIT, HER2, EGFR, and maspin. Correlations to disease-specific long-term survival (mean follow-up 4.7 years) were followed by univariate and multivariate analysis.;Findings included the following: an association between loss of maspin and the presence of nodal metastasis, residual tumour, and poor overall survival for adenoid cystic carcinoma; common C-KIT expression in adenoid cystic carcinoma (92%); correlation of loss of C-KIT with high malignancy grade, nodal metastases, high proliferative activity (Ki-67>30%), and unfavourable survival in all tumours; common HER2 expression (83%) in salivary duct carcinoma but no relation to the total collective's survival. Overexpression of EGFR was associated with poor survival rates. In multivariate analysis, a high proliferation index was the strongest predictive factor, followed by the presence of residual tumour, overexpression of EGFR, and advanced clinical stage.;The clinical stage is of higher prognostic value than histology and grade of malignancy.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express KIT and respond favorably to imatinib therapy. To determine other tumors in which such a molecular targeted therapy might be indicated, we investigated KIT expression in different human tumor types. Because recent studies in GISTs suggest that KIT-activating mutations predict response to imatinib therapy, we also sequenced a subset of positive tumors.;More than 3,000 tumors from more than 120 different tumor categories were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format. Seven commercially available anti-KIT antibodies were initially evaluated. The antibody A4502 (DAKO) was selected for analysis because of a high frequency of positivity in GIST and low staining background in other tissues. To determine the frequency of KIT mutations in various tumor types, the exons 2, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 17 (where mutations previously were reported) were sequenced in 36 tumors with strong KIT expression.;KIT positivity was detected in 28 of 28 GISTs (100%), 42 of 50 seminomas (84%), 34 of 52 adenoid-cystic carcinomas (65%), 14 of 39 malignant melanomas (35%), and eight of 47 large-cell carcinomas of the lung (17%), as well as in 47 additional tumor types.

Over 90% of ACC tumors are c-kit-positive, and these primary cultures proved to be of short-term usefulness in assessing chemosensitivity. Interaction was determined over a wide range of drug combinations using a statistical three-dimensional analysis model. Both ACC short-term cultures and HNSCC cell lines were demonstrated to have a response ranging from additive to synergistic when imatinib and cisplatin were combined. The interaction of imatinib on cisplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was further investigated using the comet-X assay. In contrast, significant antagonism was observed when imatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Since gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the effect of imatinib on this enzyme was investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of dCK was observed, highlighting this kinase as a possible additional secondary molecular target for imatinib.

Eighty-six cases of STACC included 45 females and 41 males, aged 12-91 years (mean 54.4 years). Patients presented most frequently with obstructive symptoms (n = 54), followed by epistaxis (n = 23), auditory symptoms (n = 12), nerve symptoms (n = 11), nasal discharge (n = 11), and/or visual symptoms (n = 10), present for a mean of 18.2 months. The tumors involved the nasal cavity alone (n = 25), nasopharynx alone (n = 13), maxillary sinus alone (n = 4), or a combination of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (n = 44), with a mean size of 3.7 cm. Patients presented equally between low and high stage disease: stage I and II (n = 42) or stage III and IV (n = 44) disease. Histologically, the tumors were invasive (bone: n = 66; neural: n = 47; lymphovascular: n = 33), composed of a variety of growth patterns, including cribriform (n = 33), tubular (n = 16), and solid (n = 9), although frequently a combination of these patterns was seen within a single tumor. Pleomorphism was mild with an intermediate N:C ratio in cells containing hyperchromatic nuclei. Reduplicated basement membrane and glycosaminoglycan material was commonly seen. Necrosis (n = 16) and atypical mitotic figures (n = 11) were infrequently present. Pleomorphic adenoma was present in 9 cases; de-differentiation was seen in two patients. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive reactions for pan-cytokeratin, CK7, CK5/6, CAM5.2, and EMA, with myoepithelial reactivity with SMA, p63, calponin, S100 protein and SMMHC. CD117, CEA, GFAP and p16 were variably present. CK20 and HR HPV were negative. STACC needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of most sinonasal malignancies, particularly poorly differentiated carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma and pleomorphic adenoma. Surgery (n = 82), often accompanied by radiation therapy (n = 36), was generally employed. A majority of patients developed a recurrence (n = 52) 2-144 months after initial presentation. Overall mean follow-up was 19.4 years (range 0.4-37.5 years): 46 patients died with disease (mean 6.4 years); 5 were alive with disease (mean 5.4 years), and 35 patients were either alive or had died of unrelated causes (mean 16.3 years). ACC of the SNT is uncommon. Recurrences are common. The following parameters, when present, suggest an increased incidence of either recurrence or dying with disease: mixed site of involvement, high stage disease (stage IV), skull base involvement, tumor recurrence, a solid histology, perineural invasion, bone invasion, and lymphovascular invasion.",

The patients of cBCA ranged from 24 to 71 years with a distinct predilection for females (79%). The tumor was well-circumscribed and had no recurrent tendency after a local excision followed by a median of 67 months. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor was rich in blood supply. Microscopically, it was mainly composed by the basaloid cells with the peripheral palisading. The cells around the cribriform pattern expressed P63 protein and had almost no immunoreactivity for calponin, SMA, S100, or CK8&18.

Excisional biopsy revealed a pseudoencapsulated, bosselated tumor with a spindled, hypocellular and heavily PAS-positive stroma constituted by abundant basement membrane material and collagen. Scattered lumens and focal cribriform cellular clusters were present in the peripheries of several of the lobules. Immunohistochemistry showed epithelial membrane antigen+ and cytokeratin (CK) 7+ in many small lumenal structures. The spindled cells were calponin+, CK5/6+, CK14+, and p63+, confirming their myoepithelial nature.

Since both PDGF-R and c-kit both having a putative role in tumorigenesis, we investigated the efficacy and safety of the use of IM in patients with endocrine tumors unresponsive to conventional therapies that expressed c-kit and/or PDGF-R (within the framework of a comprehensive phase II multi-center study of IM in patients with solid tumors). IM was initiated at a dose of 400 mg/day, with possible dose escalation within 1 week to 600 mg/day and an option to raise the dose to 800 mg/day in the event of progression and in the absence of safety concerns for a period of up to 12 months. Between September 2002 and July 2003, 15 adult patients with disseminated endocrine tumors were recruited as follows: medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC, n = 6); adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC, n = 4); malignant pheochromocytoma (pheo, n = 2); carcinoid (non-secreting, n = 2), neuroendocrine tumor (NET, n = 1).

Although largely characterized as indolent, poor outcomes have been reported in a considerable fraction of cases. As yet, optimum treatment strategies for this cancer have not been developed. This study investigates protein expression of common or potential molecular therapeutic targets and reports on the clinicopathological features of 9 new cases. We evaluated the expression of ERBB2, KIT, androgen receptor, PTEN, EGFR, ERG, and p53 via immunohistochemistry. We also examined EGFR amplification and TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The mean clinical follow-up was 44 months. We found that basal cell carcinoma behaved aggressively with almost one-half of the cases displaying high-risk pathologic features or local recurrence (44%). One patient died as a result of metastatic disease. The most consistent abnormalities included a loss of PTEN expression (56% of cases) and EGFR overexpression (67% of cases). EGFR overexpression occurred in the absence of gene amplification. The TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement was not detected in any of the tumors studied, nor was ERG protein positivity identified by immunostaining. In addition, ERBB2, KIT, p53, and androgen receptor expressions were either absent or showed only weak, limited reactivity. Our results suggest that there is a high morbidity associated with this tumor, and more intense follow-up and additional treatment may be indicated. Furthermore, targeted therapies directed against the EGFR and PTEN proteins or their constitutive pathways may be promising for future clinical management. ",

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is included among these subtypes even if it has never been formally reported. We evaluated the clinical, radiologic, morphologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features of 4 cases of thymic neoplasms with ACC-like features retrieved from the authors' consult files. Most cases affected adult/elderly males (mean 68.5 y; range: 63 to 77 y; M:F ratio=3:1), and were asymptomatic. The clinical history (no evidence of ACC in other sites), radiologic findings (a mass in the thymic region), and morphologic features (residual thymic tissue at the periphery of the neoplasm) strongly supported their primary thymic nature. Grossly, most of the tumors presented as multicystic lesions. On microscopic examination there were true glandular spaces filled with periodic acid-Schiff+material, and pseudocysts containing stromal mucin, collagen IV, and laminin. Features favoring malignancy were overtly infiltrative margins (2/4), mitotic figures (2/4), cytologic atypia (1/4), vascular invasion (1/4), absence of organoid thymuslike pattern (4/4), and absence of immature (TdT+) T lymphocytes (3/3). Necrosis and nerve invasion were not observed. The tumor cells showed the following immunophenotype: p63+(3/3), CK34betaE12+(3/3), CD5+ in scattered cells (1/3), CD117- (3/3), chromogranin-(2/2), synaptophysin-(2/2), and CD56- (2/2). MIB-1 ranged from 1% to 10%. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed an isolated gain of chromosome 8 in 1/3 cases. One patient is alive and well after 20 months, 1 died of another cause 5 years later, and 2 were lost at follow-up. Exceptionally, primary thymic tumors may exhibit histologic features resembling those of ACC of salivary glands. They may be well circumscribed and cytologically bland or invasive and cytologically atypical. In either case they lack an organoid thymuslike pattern and immature T lymphocytes. We have interpreted them as a microscopic subtype of well-differentiated thymic carcinoma of low-grade malignancy, an impression supported by the admittedly limited follow-up information.",

In this study, the transcripts of KIT were identified by RT-PCR for a dominant white fox and a normal blue fox. Sequence analysis showed that the KIT transcript in normal blue fox contained the full-length coding sequence of 2919 bp (GenBank Acc. No KF530833), but in the dominant white individual, a truncated isoform lacking the entire exon 12 specifically co-expressed with the normal transcript. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (c.1867+1G>T) in intron 12 appeared only in the dominant white individuals and a 1-bp ins/del polymorphism in the same intron showed in individuals representing two different coat colours. Genotyping results of the SNP with PCR-RFLP in 185 individuals showed all 90 normal blue foxes were homozygous for the G allele, and all dominant white individuals were heterozygous. Due to the truncated protein with a deletion of 35 amino acids and an amino acid replacement (p.Pro623Ala) located in the conserved ATP binding domain, we propose that the mutant receptor had absent tyrosine kinase activity. These findings reveal that the base substitution at the first nucleotide of intron 12 of KIT gene, resulting in skipping of exon 12, is a causative mutation responsible for the dominant white phenotype of blue fox.",

Hence, analysis of the immunological responses in the mouse may elucidate the mechanisms of immunity to trichuriasis in man. The work described here investigates the roles of eosinophils, mast cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the elimination of T. muris from the host gut. Following ablation of IL-5, and hence eosinophilia, mice usually resistant to T. muris infection remained so. Further, blocking the stem cell factor receptor, c-kit, to facilitate complete ablation of mast cells over the period of parasite expulsion in resistant mice had no effect on the development of protective immunity. Therefore it can be deduced that eosinophils and mast cells are not critical in resistance. In addition to these studies, the role of antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxic mechanisms was investigated via the analysis of an infection time course in Fc gamma R-/- mice. These animals, on a resistant background, were fully immune and expelled the parasites before development of the adult stage. Thus this model provides evidence against a major role for ADCC in resistance to infection with T. muris. The studies described here have eliminated some of the major effector mechanisms traditionally associated with helminth infection, and work continues to elucidate the critical immune responses associated with resistance.",

The primary end-point was response rate (RR) including complete response or partial response (PR); secondary end-points included RR according to Choi criteria, disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).;Thirty-seven patients (19 adenoid cystic cancers, ACC) were enrolled. Six PRs were recorded. RR was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6-32; 11% in ACC and 22% in non-ACC). Choi criteria could be applied in 30 out of 37 cases with a RR of 50% (95% CI: 31-69%); DCR was 76% (95% CI: 59-88%). Incidence of ≥G3 adverse events was 29.7%. Median PFS and OS for the entire population were 5.9 months and 23.4 months, respectively. Median PFS and OS were 8.9 and 26.4 months for ACC versus 4.2 and 12.3 months for non-ACC patients. All the cases showed expression of PDGFRβ in the stroma and VEGFR2 in endothelial cells; PDGFRα positivity was found in the stroma of four (27%) cases. All except for two cases showed no PDGFRβ, VEGFR2 and PDGFRα expression in the tumour cells. KIT expression was restricted to ACC and a weak RET expression was limited to one adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS). No BRAF mutation was found. No correlation was observed between the sorafenib activity and the expression of its markers although all six responders (two ACC, one adenocarcinoma, NOS, one salivary duct cancer [SDC], one high-grade mucoepidermoid [HG-MEC] and one poorly-differentiated cancer) are enriched in the stromal component showing a PDGFRβ immunodecoration. In ACCs, immunohistochemistry revealed MYB protein expression in 15/16 cases (94%) and the MYB-NFIB fusion oncogene was observed in 9/14 (64%).;Sorafenib is the first anti-angiogenic agent to demonstrate activity in RMSGC patients, particularly in some histotypes such as HG-MEC, SDC and adenocarcinoma, NOS. The PDGFRβ-positive rich stromal component characterising these histotypes and the lack of correlation between the activity of sorafenib and its targets suggests anti-angiogenic effect as the prevalent mechanism of action of sorafenib in SGCs.",

Unfortunately, the cell preparation of all commercial kits available includes cell washing known to cause cell loss which is most likely to affect apoptotic cells in particular. To address this, we developed a seven-color single-platform no-wash analysis technique and compared the results with those from an analogous procedure including cell washing. A five-color mAb cocktail was employed to address target cells by surface labeling, Yo-PRO-1® and DAPI were used to discriminate apoptotic and necrotic from viable cells. Cells were quantified on the basis of internal-standard fluorescent beads. Jurkat cells ACC 282 treated with camptothecin were employed to establish the staining procedure, which was then applied to blood cells collected by extracorporeal apheresis and treated with UV irradiation. Data evaluation showed that although each method by itself was highly reproducible (R(2) = 0.973), the numbers of apoptotic cells detected with the no-wash procedure were significantly higher than those obtained after cell washing (P = 6.6 E(-5), Wilcoxon Test). In addition, the observed differences increased with higher cell numbers (Bland and Altmann). We conclude that the described test is a feasible and reliable tool for apoptosis measurement and it provides results that are definitely closer to the truth than those obtained from kits that require cell washing.",

In this study, effects of RSG on duck preadipocyte differentiation were investigated. We detected cell viability using CCK method and measured the mRNA expression of key genes and protein contents involved in preadipocyte differentiation via qRT-PCR and ELISA kits, respectively. Lipid accumulation was determined via Oil Red O staining extraction, and lipolysis was measured by free fatty acid release in the culture medium. Results showed that high concentrations of RSG (50, 100 μM) significantly decreased cell viability. RSG (0-10 μM) enhanced preadipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner and thus promoted lipid accumulation. With increasing RSG concentrations, cellular lipid content gradually decreased and preadipocyte differentiation was suppressed. mRNA expression of key genes involved in preadipocyte differentiation including FAS, ACC, SCD1, LPL, PLIN, SREBP1c, and ATGL were significantly upregulated by RSG, and the protein content of FAS, ACC, and ATGL were also increased in response to RSG. Meanwhile, RSG exposure increased free fatty acid release in the culture medium. Similar results were obtained in response to RSG plus oleate that was used to induce cell differentiation. These findings suggest that RSG does not promote duck preadipocyte viability, but it does induce duck preadipocyte differentiation, which might influence both lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether cytokine genotypes TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-6, interferon-gamma, and transforming growth factor beta were associated with acute persistent rejection after lung transplantation.;Cytokine genotyping was performed in 119 adult lung transplantation recipients who underwent surveillance transbronchial biopsies during their first year after transplantation. We categorized recipients with acute persistent rejection if they had 2 consecutive biopsy specimens at >/=Grade A2 despite anti-rejection treatment. We performed cytokine genotyping using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers technique, with a commercially available kit.;We analyzed the IL-10 genotype in 116 patients. For the increased IL-10 production genotype, 7 of 20 patients (35%) were persistent rejecters. In comparison, 57 of 96 patients (59%) with intermediate or decreased IL-10 production genotype had acute persistent rejection (p = 0.046). For IL-10 haplotypes associated with intermediate IL-10 production, 30 of 45 patients with GCC/ACC haplotype (67%) had acute persistent rejection compared with 10 of 22 patients with GCC/ATA (45%). In the patients with intermediate IL-10 production, 17 of 22 (77%) with IL-10 GCC/ACC and IL-6 G/C had acute persistent rejection, whereas only 2 of 7 patients (29%) with IL-10 GCC/ATA and IL-6 G/G had acute persistent rejection (p = 0.018).;In lung transplant recipients, the increased IL-10 production genotype protects against acute persistent rejection when compared with the intermediate or decreased IL-10 production genotypes. The intermediate IL-10 production genotype in lung transplant recipients can be differentiated into 2 haplotype responses, with the GCC/ACC haplotype associated more with acute persistent rejection. In lung transplant recipients, the immunomodulatory effects of IL-6 are differentiated in the G/C and G/G alleles in conjunction with IL-10 haplotypes, with G/C being associated with more acute persistent rejection in conjunction with the IL-10 GCC/ACC haplotype. Future pharmacogenomic models may incorporate these associations with acute persistent rejection in lung transplant recipients to formulate individualized therapeutic regimens.",

White adipose tissues from several anatomical locations were dissected. Serum parameters were analyzed by using commercial kits. The activities of fatty acid synthase and heparin-releasable lipoprotein lipase (HR-LPL) were measured using spectrophotometric and fluorimetric methods, and protein expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipose tissue triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) by western blot.;The administration of either resveratrol or quercetin separately did not induce significant reductions in adipose tissue weights. By contrast, the combination of both molecules led to a significant reduction in all the fat depots analyzed.

Here we evaluated both the analytical performance and clinical performance of this assay. Analytical studies with corresponding panels demonstrated that the accuracy for detection of different mutation types (10 wild-type samples and 12 mutant type samples), the limit of detection (2×10(3) to 2×10(4) bacilli/ml), reproducibility (standard deviation [SD], <0.4°C), and the lowest heteroresistance level (40%) all met the parameters preset by the kit. The assay could be run on five types of real-time PCR machines, with the shortest running time (105 min) obtained with the LightCycler 480 II. Clinical studies enrolled 1,096 clinical isolates collected from three geographically different tuberculosis centers, including 437 INH-resistant isolates and 659 INH-susceptible isolates characterized by traditional drug susceptibility testing on Löwenstein-Jensen solid medium. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the MeltPro TB/INH assay were 90.8% and 96.4%, respectively. DNA sequencing analysis showed that, except for the 5 mutants outside the detection range of the MeltPro assay, a concordance rate between the two methods of 99.1% (457/461) was obtained.

Intracellular lipid droplets were detected by Oil-Red-O staining, and the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP-1), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 and 2, Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1(CPT-1) was analyzed by real time reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). And glucose consumption was measured with commercial kit. Furthermore, Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with HFD to induce NAFLD. Groups of mice were given plant extracts orally at 100 and 300 mg/kg at daily for 4 weeks. After 3 weeks of AE extract treatment, we performed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Liver tissue was procured for histological examination, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activity.;In the present study, AE extract was shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and significantly downregulate the level of lipogenic genes and upregulate the expression of lipolysis genes in HepG2 cells. And also, AE extract significantly increased the glucose consumption, indicating that AE extract improved insulin resistance. Subsequently, we confirmed the inhibitory activity of AE extract on NAFLD, in vivo. Treatment with AE extract significantly decreased body weight and the fasting glucose level, alleviated hyperinsulinism and hyperlipidemia, and reduced glucose levels, as determined by OGTT. Additionally, AE extract decreased PI3K and Akt activity.;Our results suggest that treatment with AE extract ameliorated NAFLD by inhibiting insulin resistance through activation of the Akt/GLUT4 pathway.",
