In this study we have investigated the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression as a prognostic marker for predicting cancer behavior and clinical outcome in gastric cancer patients undergoing potentially curative surgery.;Epidermal growth factor receptor determination using a commercially available immunohistochemistry (IHC) kit was performed in tissues from 82 gastric cancer patients receiving primary surgical treatment and in 25 normal gastric mucosa specimens from noncancer patients. The EGFR positivity was correlated with disease recurrence and survival in univariate and multivariate analyses.;Forty-four percent (36 cases) of gastric cancers were EGFR positive. In 66 curatively treated patients, EGFR expression correlated with disease recurrence and poorer survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In a multivariate model for predicting recurrence and survival, advanced tumor extension (T(3) or T(4)), nodal metastases, and EGFR expression were the only independent covariates. In particular, EGFR expression was shown to be a significant predictor of poor prognosis among gastric cancer patients having the same stage according to the current TNM staging system.;These findings suggest that EGFR expression may be useful in identifying high-risk gastric cancer patients undergoing potentially curative surgery.

In the current study we explored the role of EGFR and its potential use as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer. First we analyzed 66 gastric cancer samples of Asian and Caucasian patients for the presence of EGFR mutations. No activating EGFR mutations were found and gefitinib alone was only weakly effective in gastric cancer cell lines. However, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of gefitinib indicating synergistic action. Whole genome expression profiling indicated significant regulation of 120 genes in the case of co-administration of gefitinib and ASA (32 induced, 88 repressed) in gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Further analyses indicated that several important signalling pathways were effectively inhibited by simultaneous exposure to gefitinib and ASA. Our findings indicate that although gastric cancer does not seem to harbour mutations which render the cancer cells constitutively susceptible to gefitinib, the co-administration of ASA can strengthen RTK inhibitor activity in adenocarcinoma cells by EGFR activation. This is the first report of effective modulation of EGFR-inhibition activity in cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancers of the esophagus and stomach present a major health burden worldwide. In the past 30 years we have witnessed some interesting shifts in terms of epidemiology of esophago gastric cancers. Regardless of a world region, the majority of patients diagnosed with esophageal or gastric cancers die from progression or recurrence of their disease. While there are many active cytotoxic agents for esophageal and stomach cancers, their impact on the disease course has been modest at best. Median survival for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer is still less than a year. Therefore, novel strategies, based on our understanding of biology and genetics, are desperately needed. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway has been implicated in pathophysiology of many epithelial malignancies, including esophageal and stomach cancers. EGFR inhibitors, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have been explored in patients with esophageal and gastric cancers. It appears that tumors of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) may be more sensitive to EGFR blockade than distal gastric adenocarcinomas. Investigations looking into potential molecular predictors of sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors for patients with esophageal and GEJ cancers are ongoing. While we are still searching for those predictors, it is clear that they will be different from ones identified in lung and colorectal cancers. Further development of EGFR inhibitors for esophageal and GEJ cancers should be driven by better understanding of EGFR pathway disregulation that drives cancer progression in a sensitive patient population.",

Because of the causal involvement of EGFR and its ligands in gastric cancer growth, we investigated expression of ERRP and cell proliferation in human gastric cancer.;We examined ERRP expression and localisation in surgical specimens of gastric cancers from 47 patients versus non-malignant gastric mucosa and determined their relationship to cell proliferation and differentiation. We also examined expression of ERRP by western blotting in three different gastric cancer cell lines. To further determine the functional properties of ERRP, we examined the effect of ERRP on epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced EGFR phosphorylation essential for its activation in MKN-28 gastric cancer cells.;ERRP expression was dramatically reduced in gastric cancers (34% of all specimens positive) compared with non-malignant gastric mucosa (66% of specimens positive). Expression of ERRP in cancer cells inversely correlated with cell proliferation and grade of malignancy. Cell lines derived from metastatic gastric cancers had reduced ERRP expression compared with cell lines derived from a non-metastatic cancer. Exogenous ERRP protein markedly inhibited EGF induced EGFR phosphorylation in gastric cancer cells providing a novel molecular mechanism of its action.;Our data indicate that downregulation of ERRP could play an important role in gastric cancer differentiation and progression.

Forty cases of GC and the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) were collected, and the expression of EGFR was assessed using immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples. Furthermore, EGFR signaling was blocked by constructed recombinant small hairpin RNA lentiviral vector (Lv-shRAGE) used to transfect into human GC SGC-7901 cells.

Cell apoptosis and cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. EGFR was found highly expressed in cancer tissues compared with the ANCT and correlated with lymph node metastases. Knockdown of EGFR reduced cell proliferation and invasion of GC with decreased expression of AKT, PCNA and MMP-9 and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest.

The combination of 5FU and cetuximab synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in GC cells with EGFR overexpression. Cetuximab also induced down-regulation of phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT, leading to diminished signaling.

Somatic MEK1 gene mutations have been reported as oncogenic activating mutations in gastric cancer, and MEK inhibitors can be effective against such gastric cancers. In the present study, however, activated EGFR and HER2 signals after treatment with a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) were found in a MEK1-mutated gastric cancer cell line (OCUM-1 cell line) using a phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array. The phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 reactivated ERK1/2, which had been inhibited by trametinib, and EGF stimulation led to resistance to trametinib in this cell line. Lapatinib, an EGFR and an HER2 inhibitor, reversed the activation of ERK1/2 by inhibiting the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 and cancelled the resistance. The combination of trametinib and lapatinib synergistically inhibited the cell growth of the OCUM-1 cell line and strongly induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activated EGFR and HER2 signals. These results suggest that the EGFR and HER2 signals play a salvage role and are related to resistance to MEK inhibitors in MEK1‑mutated gastric cancer. Moreover, combination therapy with trametinib and lapatinib can exhibit a synergistic effect and may contribute to overcoming the resistance to MEK inhibitors. ",

Of the four epidermal growth factor receptors, EGFR and HER2 are well-known oncogenes involved in gastric cancer. Little, however, is known about the role played by HER3 and HER4 in this disease. We obtained paired samples from the tumor and the adjacent normal tissue from the same patient undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. Using RT-qPCR, we quantified the mRNA expression of the four receptors including the HER4 splicing isoforms and all the ligands activating these receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, the protein expression of HER4 was also quantified. We found that HER2 mRNA expression was upregulated in the tumor tissue compared to the matched normal tissue (p = 0.0520). All ligands with affinity for EGFR were upregulated, whereas the expression of EGFR was unchanged. Interestingly, we found the mRNA expression of HER4 (p = 0.0002) and its ligand NRG4 (p = 0.0009) to be downregulated in the tumor tissue compared to the matched normal tissue. HER4 downregulation was demonstrated for all the alternatively spliced isoforms of this receptor. These results support the involvement of EGFR and HER2 in gastric cancer and suggest an interesting association of reduced HER4 expression with development of gastric cancer. ",

The frequency of positive EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 protein expression in all patients was 17.5%, 11.8%, 14.8% and 32.9%, respectively. There were no differences in protein expression of any of the markers between the two groups. There were, however, statistically significant associations between HER4 and all other HER family members, as well as between HER2 and HER3 expression. Of note, EGFR-positive membranous protein expression was significantly associated with the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p=0.027) and HER3 and HER4 negative cytoplasmic protein expression with well/moderately-differentiated tumors (p=0.030 and p=0.014, respectively). None of the HER family members were of prognostic value for OS in univariate analysis.;The present study confirmed the known protein expression frequencies of HER family members in gastric cancer in a Greek population. Several associations were observed among the HER family members and between clinicopathological characteristics and HER family members. Further research is needed on their exact prognostic role, as well as their therapeutic targeting.",

The molecular mechanisms that underlie this aggressiveness are underexplored. Here, we aimed to identify molecules associated with this unique phenotype. Tumor specimens from patients with stage III gastric cancer with high or low ND (n = 4 for both) were compared at the mRNA level using Affymetrix microarray (harboring 54,675 genes). The expression data were prioritized, and genes that correlated with ND were selected. Ultimately, the EGFR was validated as such a candidate molecule in patients with primary advanced gastric cancer who underwent standard treatment (n = 167). Expression data of the microarray were prioritized based on gene expression ratio and frequency of gene expression. The first priority genes to be selected were genes that are known to be amplified in cancer, which included NKX2.1, CHST9, CTNND2, SLC25A27, FGFR2, EGFR, and PTGER1. Of these genes, the EGFR gene was of particular interest. EGFR expression in primary gastric cancer was examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The Student's t-test elucidated a significant difference in EGFR expression between IHC 2+/3+ and IHC 1+ according to ND (P = 0.0035). The Chi-square test also indicated a significant difference between high and low levels of EGFR immunohistochemical staining (IHC2+/3+ and IHC1+, respectively) and ND status (P = 0.0023). According to the least squares method, as ND increased, the risk that EGFR staining levels changed from IHC 1+ to IHC 2+ also increased. In this study, we determined that high EGFR expression may underlie the aggressive mechanism of advanced gastric cancer with high ND. ",

However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have also proven ineffective against most tumors with EGFR wild-type (WT) alleles. Although some genetic changes, including the KRAS mutation, have been shown to confer resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, novel strategies for the treatment of cancer patients with tumors harboring EGFR WT alleles have yet to be thoroughly delineated. The principal objective of this study was to improve our current understanding of drug interactions between EGFR and MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors in an effort to gain insight into a novel therapeutic strategy against EGFR WT tumors. Using a panel of human EGFR WT gastric cancer cell lines, we showed that gastric cancer cells harboring the KRAS mutation were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition as compared with those cells harboring KRAS and PI3K mutations and KRAS WT alleles. However, all cell lines were found to be resistant to EGFR inhibition. The results from Western blots and phosphoprotein arrays showed that, in MEK inhibitor resistant cell lines, AKT was activated through the EGFR/HER3/PI3K pathway following AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) treatment. Blockade of this feedback mechanism through the targeting of MEK and EGFR resulted in detectable synergistic effects in some cell lines in vitro and in vivo.

The results demonstrated that EGFR phosphorylation was markedly inhibited in gastric cancer cell lines (SGC7901 and MGC803) which possessed functional K‑ras and BRAF following treatment with cetuximab.

Furthermore, cetuximab induced phosphorylation of the non‑receptor tyrosine kinase c‑steroid receptor co‑activator (Src). Treatment of gastric cancer cells with a Src inhibitor was shown to significantly reduce cetuximab‑induced phosphorylation of IGF‑IR as well as Src, which resulted in enhanced sensitivity to cetuximab treatment.

Moreover, strong correlation was detected among these three factors. To examine whether a causal link exists, we used two human gastric carcinoma lines, SNU-5 and HGC27, to study the molecular basis of miRNA-34a, EGFR signaling, and MMP7 activation. We found that EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation in SNU-5 or HGC27 cells activated MMP7 and consequently cancer invasiveness. Both an inhibitor for EGFR and an inhibitor for Akt significantly inhibited the EGF-induced activation of MMP7, suggesting a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade dependent pathway. Moreover, miRNA-34a levels were not affected by EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation. However, overexpression of miRNA-34a antagonized EGF-induced MMP7 activation without affecting EGFR phosphorylation in SNU-5 or HGC27 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that miRNA-34 inhibits EGFR signaling via downstream PI3K signaling cascades to regulate MMP7 expression in gastric carcinoma. Thus, miRNA-34a, EGFR, and MMP7 appear to be promising therapeutic targets for preventing the metastasis of gastric carcinoma.",

Reliable biomarkers for the identification of patients who             are likely to benefit from this treatment are not available. In this study, we             assessed the activity of cetuximab in five gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, AZ521,             Hs746T, LMSU and MKN1). The viability of two of these cell lines, AZ521 and MKN1,             was significantly reduced by cetuximab treatment. High expression and secretion             levels of the EGFR-binding ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), were associated with cetuximab             responsiveness. MET activation and mutations in Kirsten-Ras gene (KRAS) were associated             with cetuximab resistance. By introducing a hierarchy between these markers, we             established a model that facilitated the correct classification of all five gastric             cancer cell lines as cetuximab responsive or non-responsive. The highest priority             was allocated to activating KRAS mutations, followed by MET activation and finally             by the levels of secreted AREG. In order to validate these results, we used three             additional human gastric cancer cell lines (KATOIII, MKN28 and MKN45).

The miRNA miR-7 was selected for further investigation, which included real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of miR-7 levels in different gastric cancer cell lines and tissues and distant non-tumor tissues from patient resections. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell migration and invasion, and western blot assays were performed to assess tumor cell viability, invasion and gene expression, respectively, after miR-7 transfection. The miRNA microarray profiling revealed 14 upregulated miRNAs (including miR-21, miR-26b and miR-30b) and 19 downregulated miRNAs (including let-7i, miR-7 and miR-622) between gastric cancer and normal cell lines. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that reduced miR-7 expression occurred more frequently in poorly and moderately differentiated gastric cancer MGC-803, MKN-45 and SGC-7901 cell lines than in the well-differentiated gastric cancer NCI-N87 cell line, which was consistent with the results for gastric cancer tissues. Expression of miR-7 was downregulated in 86.9% (20/23) of the gastric cancer tissues compared with that in the distant non-tumor tissues. Restoration of miR-7 expression significantly inhibited tumor cell viability, invasiveness and migration when compared with the control cells. Luciferase assay confirmed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a target gene of mR-7, and expression of miR-7 significantly suppressed EGFR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels.

However, the mechanisms by which H. pylori causes cancer are currently unknown. Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor (EGFR) may be important in the development of gastric cancer. This interaction accelerates cell proliferation and migration, and triggers epithelial cell signaling. In this study, we investigated the effects of H. pylori on EGFR- and AP-1-mediated signal transduction pathways in the AGS gastric epithelial cell line and gastric tissue from humans.;Cells were treated with H. pylori and cell death was examined at a variety of time points using cell viability and trypan blue exclusion dye assay. To investigate the effects on EGFR regulation, AGS cells were transfected with a full-length and truncated EGFR luciferase (luc) reporter. Tissue microarray containing 44 samples of gastric biopsies from H. pylori-positive patients was analyzed for protein expression level of EGFR by immunohistochemistry.;EGFR promoter activity was increased (twofold) 3 h after treatment with H. pylori commenced. Using a series of EGFR promoter deletion mutants, we identified a region that was crucial for transactivation of the EGFR by H. pylori. To determine whether AP-1 binding was altered, we transfected AGS cells with an AP-1 luciferase construct and then treated them with H. pylori for up to 6 h. We found that AP-1 activity was induced by H. pylori in gastric cells, while electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that binding of AP-1 to the EGFR promoter site was increased following H. pylori treatment. Binding of c-Jun and c-Fos to the EGFR promoter region -1,062/-900 was induced eight- and six fold, respectively, using ChIP assay. Active EGFR staining was markedly increased in gastric mucosa from infected persons, compared to uninfected controls.;We conclude that exposure of gastric cells to H. pylori induces increased production of EGFR through various signal transduction pathways, including those mediated by the EGFR and AP-1. Distinct effects on EGFR activation may specify the subset of AP-1 target genes that are selected, including those involved in proliferation and apoptosis. This is consistent with EGFR activation that was found in the gastric mucosa of humans infected with H. pylori. Hence, the balance between apoptosis and proliferation in these cells may be altered in response to injury caused by H. pylori infection, leading to an increased risk of cancer.",

In this study, we showed a novel signal transduction pathway using two human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN28 and MKN74. Both gastric cancer cells expressed leptin and its receptors (Ob-R) at the protein level. We found that leptin, even at as low as 0.1 ng/mL, induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Time-course experiments revealed that phosphorylation was maximal after 5 minutes of stimulation and declined thereafter. We also revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR induced by leptin was significantly attenuated by two inhibitors, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478, and a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM6001. This indicates that the pathway of EGFR transactivation induced by leptin is dependent on proteolytically released EGFR ligands. Leptin induced JAK2 activation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation in these gastric cancer cells, both of which occurred after the peak of EGFR transactivation. Pretreatment of gastric cancer cells with AG1478 significantly reduced the degree of phosphorylation of both JAK2 and ERK1/2. These findings indicate the involvement of EGFR transactivation in the activation of JAK2 and ERK1/2. Our results reveal that EGFR transactivation is involved in the leptin signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells, which extends the physiologic action of leptin beyond its central effects in the hypothalamus to regulate body weight.",

EGFR activation regulates PKM2 functions in a subcellular compartment-dependent manner and promotes gene transcription and tumor growth. In addition, PKM2 is upregulated in EGFR-induced pathways in glioma malignancies. However, we found that PKM2 could also regulate the activity of the EGF/EGFR signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells. We aimed to define the biological mechanisms for PKM2 in regulating the cell motility and invasion.;We employed stable transfection with short hairpin RNA to stably silence the expression of PKM2 in the BGC823, SGC7901 and AGS gastric cancer cell lines. The effects of PKM2 in vitro were determined by assessing cell migration and invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to explore the relationship among PKM2 and other proteins.;Our results indicate that the knockdown of PKM2 decreased the activity of E-cadherin and enhanced the EGF/EGFR signaling pathway in the gastric cell lines BGC823 and SGC7901 that were positive for E-cadherin expression. However, in the undifferentiated gastric carcinoma cell line AGS, which lacks E-cadherin expression, PKM2 promoted cell migration and invasion. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that the levels of E-cadherin expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and cytoplasmic PKM2 expression were correlated with each other.;PKM2 may play different roles in differently differentiated gastric cancer cell types, and this finding would be consistent with the previous clinical research.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a rate-limiting enzyme for prostanoid biosynthesis, including prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and plays a key role in both inflammation and cancer. It has been demonstrated that inhibition of COX-2 and PGE(2) receptor signaling results in the suppression of tumor development in a variety of animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying COX-2/PGE(2)-associated inflammation in carcinogenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. In order to study the role of PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses in tumorigenesis, it is important to use in vivo mouse models that recapitulate human cancer development from molecular mechanisms with construction of tumor microenvironment. We have developed a gastritis model (K19-C2mE mice) in which an inflammatory microenvironment is constructed in the stomach via induction of the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway. We also developed a gastric cancer mouse model (Gan mice) in which the mice develop inflammation-associated gastric tumors via activation of both the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway and Wnt signaling. Expression analyses using these in vivo models have revealed novel mechanisms of the inflammatory responses underlying gastric cancer development. PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling through the induction of EGFR ligands and ADAMs that release EGFR ligands from the cell membrane. In Gan mice, a combination treatment with EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors significantly suppresses gastric tumorigenesis. Moreover, PGE(2)-associated inflammation downregulates tumor suppressor microRNA, miR-7, in gastric cancer cells, which suppresses epithelial differentiation. These results indicate that PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses promote in vivo gastric tumorigenesis via several different molecular mechanisms.",

This study evaluated the mechanism of interleukin (IL)-8- and IL-1beta-dependent shedding of the EGFR ligand in KATO III cells.;We established transfectants stably expressing alkaline phosphatase-tagged heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), transforming growth factor alpha, or amphiregulin precursors, and depleted ADAM proteins, using short interfering RNA against ADAM10, 12, or 17. We assessed shedding of EGFR ligands by measuring AP activities in the conditioned media after IL-1beta or IL-8 stimulation. EGFR activation was examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibody. KB-R7785 and anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody were used to inhibit activities of ADAMs and IL-8 action, respectively.;IL-8 dose dependently released the EGFR ligands and transiently phosphorylated EGFR, with a peak at 15 minutes.

IL-1beta dose dependently enhanced shedding of HB-EGF, which was not blocked by KB-R7785 in the early phase. In the late phase, however, the EGFR transactivation was blocked by KB-R7785 and abrogated by anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody.;IL-8 induces shedding of EGFR ligands because of an ADAM10-dependent pathway in gastric cancer cells, whereas IL-1beta acts principally by an ADAM-independent pathway.

Here, we analyzed the relationship between PAR1 activation, proliferation, invasion, and the signaling pathways downstream of PAR1 activation in gastric cancer.;We established a PAR1 stably transfected MKN45 human gastric cancer cell line (MKN45/PAR1) and performed cell proliferation and invasion assays employing this cell line and MKN28 cell line exposed to PAR1 agonists (alpha-thrombin and TFLLR-NH2). We also quantified NF-kappaB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and the level of Tenascin-C (TN-C) expression in conditioned medium by ELISA of MKN45/PAR1 following administration of alpha-thrombin. A high molecular weight concentrate was derived from the resultant conditioned medium and subsequent cultures of MKN45/PAR1 and MKN28 were exposed to the resultant concentrate either in the presence or absence of TN-C-neutralizing antibody. Lysates of these subsequent cells were probed to quantify levels of phospholyrated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).;PAR1 in both PAR1/MKN45 and MKN28 was activated by PAR1 agonists, resulting in cell proliferation and matrigel invasion. We have shown that activation of NF-kappaB and EGFR phosphorylation initially were triggered by the activation of PAR1 with alpha-thrombin. Quantitative PCR and Western blot assay revealed up-regulation of mRNA and protein expression of NF-kappaB target genes, especially TN-C, a potential EGFR activator. The suppressed level of phosphorylated EGFR, observed in cells exposed to concentrate of conditioned medium in the presence of TN-C-neutralizing antibody, identifies TN-C as a putative autocrine stimulatory factor of EGFR possibly involved in the sustained PAR1 activation responses observed.;Our data indicate that in gastric carcinoma cells, PAR1 activation can trigger an array of responses that would promote tumor cell growth and invasion. Over expression of NF-kappaB, EGFR, and TN-C, are among the effects of PAR1 activation and TN-C induces EGFR activation in an autocrine manner.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility of molecular therapy targeting HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer liver metastasis. We developed three new HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines (GLM-1, GLM-2, GLM-4) without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations derived from such liver metastasis, two of which had HER2 gene amplifications. All these GLM series of cell lines were highly sensitive to gefitinib in vitro, a specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase (Iressa) rather than anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), whereas most of the HER2 low-expressing counterparts were not. In these HER2-overexpressing GLM series, protein kinase B (Akt), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), was constitutively phosphorylated, and gefitinib efficiently inhibited this Akt phosphorylation, induced strong apoptosis in vitro and exhibited antitumour activity in tumour xenografts in nude mice. This gefitinib-mediated antitumour effect in xenograft was significantly potentiated by trastuzumab treatment. On the other hand, gefitinib-resistant cells (GLM-1R) exhibited increased EGFR expression, followed by constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These results suggest that the antitumour effect of gefitinib is due to the effective inhibition of HER2-driven constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and that the acquired resistance to gefitinib is due to the constitutive activation of Ras/MAPK pathway in compensation for PI3K/Akt pathway. Gastric cancer liver metastasis with HER2 overexpression would be a potential molecular target for gefitinib and trastuzumab.",

Lapatinib, a dual HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promising in vitro results in treating HER2(+) cancer cells. However, several studies have shown that activation of alternative receptor tyrosine kinases can mediate resistance to HER-targeted therapy. Here, we investigated whether activated MET can confer resistance to lapatinib inhibition of gastric cancer cells. A panel of gastric cancer cell lines was treated with lapatinib, and we observed that cell proliferation was reduced by 70% and that the degree of HER2 amplification corresponds to sensitivity to lapatinib. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, MET, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase was inhibited by lapatinib and presumably led to cell-cycle arrest as observed with flow cytometry. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activation of MET receptors rescued cells from lapatinib-induced growth inhibition by restimulating the downstream pathways and restoring normal cell-cycle progression. This rescue effect could be abrogated by inhibiting MET with PHA-665752 (a highly specific MET inhibitor) or downregulating MET expression with short interfering RNA. No synergy in growth inhibition was observed when cells were treated with a combination of lapatinib and PHA-665752. Repeat studies using insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibroblast growth factor 3 could not uniformly rescue the lapatinib-treated gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, HGF/MET-mediated resistance to lapatinib is a novel mechanism of resistance to HER2-targeted agents in gastric cancer cells. Development of inhibitors targeting multiple receptors or common downstream signaling proteins merits further investigation.",

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were studied by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to cyclooxygenase-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and CD34. The immunohistochemical results were correlated with clinicopathological features and survival. In our study population, we found a male/female ratio of 72:43, a median age of 59 years, stage III and IV incidence of 66.9%, and a median follow-up of 96 months. Positive expression rates of cyclooxygenase-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor were 89.6 and 23.5%, respectively. The median microvascular density value was 52.5. When this value was determined as the cut-off point, 50% of patients were found to have high microvascular density. Epidermal growth factor receptor over-expression correlated with high microvascular density values, advanced lymph node involvement (N3), and TNM stage presentation (III and IV). Similarly, lymph node involvement was associated with cyclooxygenase-2 over-expression and high microvascular density. Univariate analysis showed that epidermal growth factor receptor over-expression, pathological T3 and T4 disease, and overall stage III and IV disease were adverse prognostic factors. On multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model, expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, and advanced TNM stage were significant adverse prognostic factors for overall survival.

However, mutation status of KRAS remains unclear in gastric cancer from Chinese Mainland. It has been proved that KRAS mutation associates with resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. In this study, KRAS mutations were detected in 52 gastric adenocarcinomas from Northern China. High-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was used and positive samples were confirmed by direct sequencing. Of the 52 cancers, KRAS mutations were found in 5 (9.6%). All cancers with KRAS mutation were from male patients. Frequencies of KRAS mutation were 14.3% (3/21) and 6.5% (2/31) in differentiated and undifferentiated cancers; 25% (1/4) and 8.3% (4/48) in early and advanced wall penetration cancers; and were 13.3% (2/15) and 8.1% (3/37) in without and with lymph node metastasis cancers, respectively. There was no significant correlation between KRAS mutation and clinicopathological features. There were 3 mutation types in the 5 mutations, including 2 G12D, 1 G12V and 2 G13D mutations. All codon 12 mutations were found in patients with lymph node metastasis and at advanced stage, whereas all codon 13 mutations were found in patients without lymph node metastasis and at early stage. These results support KRAS mutation may only be involved in carcinogenesis of partial gastric cancers and the different mutation types of KRAS may take part in development of gastric cancer at different stages. The resistance of partial gastric cancer patients to EGFR inhibitors may be induced by KRAS mutation.",

Regenerating islet-derived family, member 4 (REG4) is believed to promote peritoneal metastasis, however, its mechanism is still a moot point at present. In the present study, we show that high expression of REG4 correlates with advanced stage and poor survival prognosis for gastric cancer patients. REG4 overexpression significantly enhances peritoneal metastasis by increasing adhesion ability. Moreover, SP1 is proved to be a transcription factor of REG4 and induce REG4 expression upon TGF-alpha stimulation. Also, G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) is identified to be in the same complex of REG4, which mediates REG4's signal transduction and promotes peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer cell. Interestingly, we also discover a positive feedback loop triggered by REG4, amplifying itself through EGFR transactivation, consisting of GPR37, ADAM17, TGF-alpha, EGFR, SP1 and REG4. In conclusion, REG4 promotes peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer through GPR37 and triggers a positive feedback loop. ",

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in 20-25% of breast and gastric cancer patients, and HER2-targeted antibody therapy using trastuzumab is effective in many of these patients. Nonetheless, improving therapeutic efficacy and patient survival is important, particularly in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Here, we describe the development of 1E11, a HER2-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody showing increased efficacy in a highly synergistic manner in combination with trastuzumab in the HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines NCI-N87 and OE-19. The two antibodies bind to sub-domain IV of the receptor, but have non-overlapping epitopes, allowing them to simultaneously bind HER2. Treatment with 1E11 alone induced apoptosis in HER2-positive cancer cells, and this effect was enhanced by combination treatment with trastuzumab. Combination treatment with 1E11 and trastuzumab reduced the levels of total HER2 protein and those of aberrant HER2 signaling molecules including phosphorylated HER3 and EGFR. The synergistic antitumor activity of 1E11 in combination with trastuzumab indicates that it could be a novel potent therapeutic antibody for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing gastric cancers.",

HER2 expression was specifically downregulated by YB-1 silencing using its cognate siRNA, whereas there was less change in the expression of EGFR and HER3. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed the specific binding of YB-1 to its consensus sequence on the 5'-regulatory region of HER2. YB-1 knockdown induced drug resistance to lapatinib, a dual EGFR and HER2 kinase inhibitor, and also to erlotinib, an EGFR kinase inhibitor. Moreover, phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) was not markedly affected by lapatinib or erlotinib when YB-1 was silenced. Nuclear YB-1 expression was significantly (P = 0.026) associated with HER2 expression, but not with EGFR or HER3, in patients with gastric cancer (n = 111).

Conventional chemotherapy and radiation have shown limited efficacy for advanced gastric cancer, showing an overall survival (OS) rate of ~10 months. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is the first approved molecularly targeted agent for HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer, which was found to prolong the OS and the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients. However, HER2 overexpression is present only in a minority of patients with gastric cancer. Hence, other targeted agents are urgently needed. Ramucirumab, a novel human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), is regarded as a new standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer. The combination of two or more targeted agents directed against two different molecular targets may improve the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer. Although great efforts have been made, the effect of targeted therapy for gastric cancer is limited. One key reason is that participants in clinical trials for new targeted agents were not selected by detection of the targeted molecule.

We found that the expression level of Rab11-FIP2 was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues and high expression of Rab11-FIP2 was closely correlated with nodal metastasis in gastric cancer patients. Rab11-FIP2 overexpression promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a manner associated with gastric cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We also found that hypoxia could enhance the expression of Rab11-FIP2 through HIF-1α. Inactivation of Rab11-FIP2 dramatically decreased hypoxia-induced migration of gastric cancer cells. Suppression of the internalization of EGFR, at least in part, plays an important role in EMT induced by overexpression of Rab11-FIP2 in gastric cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that Rab11-FIP2 could regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

In vitro, the geldanamycin derivate 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) led to marked reduction in constitutive and inducible activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Akt, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha protein. In addition, EGFR and HER-2 were down-regulated after Hsp90 inhibition. With respect to regulation of angiogenic molecules, 17-AAG significantly reduced EGF-mediated VEGF secretion. Phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin were both abrogated by 17-AAG, which resulted in significant impairment of cancer cell motility. Interestingly, cytotoxic effects of 17-AAG in vitro were higher on cancer cells and gastric fibroblasts than on pericytes. In vivo, the water-soluble compound 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG; 25 mg/kg, thrice per week) significantly reduced s.c. xenografted tumor growth. By immunohistochemistry, 17-DMAG significantly reduced vessel area and numbers of proliferating tumor cells in sections. Furthermore, similar significant growth-inhibitory effects of 17-DMAG were achieved when administered as low-dose therapy (5 mg/kg, thrice per week). In conclusion, blocking Hsp90 disrupts multiple proangiogenic signaling pathways in gastric cancer cells and inhibits xenografted tumor growth in vivo. Hence, gastric cancer harbors attractive molecular targets for therapy with Hsp90 inhibitors, which could lead to improved efficacy of antineoplastic therapy regimens.",

Coactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) plays a critical role in tumor response to targeted therapeutics. We examined concomitant overexpression of EGFR and MET in patients with HER2(+) and HER2(-) gastric cancers (GCs). Tissue microarray samples obtained from 1,589 GC patients who received R0 gastrectomy with extensive node dissection and adjuvant chemoradiationtherapy were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. HER2(+) was observed in 169 patients (11%). Out of 169 HER2(+) patients, 15 (9%) were EGFR(+) and MET(+) , 29 (17%) were EGFR(+) , 37 (22%) were MET(+) and the remaining 88 patients (52%) were HER2(+) only, without concomitant EGFR or MET overexpression. Greater number of overexpressed RTKs correlated with younger age (p < 0.001), larger tumor size (p = 0.027), intestinal histology (p < 0.001) and shorter overall survival (p = 0.002). The mean overall survival was 113 months for HER2(-) /EGFR(-) /MET(-) and 63 months for HER2(+) /EGFR(+) /MET(+) subgroups. Patients with HER2(+) /EGFR(+) /MET(+) GCs had a substantial risk of death with a hazard ratio of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.54-5.90), compared with HER2(-) /EGFR(-) /MET(-) GC patients. Using patient-derived tumor cell models isolated from pericardial effusion of HER2(+) and MET(+) GC cases, we demonstrated that the combination of HER2-inhibitor (lapatinib) and MET-inhibitor offered a more profound inhibition in the ERK/AKT pathway and cell proliferation than lapatinib alone. Co-overexpression of RTKs was demonstrated in small subsets of GC associated with aggressive behavior and in these cases, combination therapy may be considered as potential treatment options. ",

Herein, we demonstrated that M. hyorhinis p37 protein expression in gastric cancer tissues predicts poor survival and associates with metastasis. M. hyorhinis infects mammalian cells and promotes gastric cancer cell invasiveness via its membrane protein p37. Synthesized peptide corresponding to the N-terminus of p37 prevents M. hyorhinis infection. Host Annexin A2 (ANXA2) interacts with the N-terminus of p37. In addition, EGFR forms a complex with p37 and ANXA2, and is required for M. hyorhinis-induced phosphorylation and membrane recruitment of ANXA2. M. hyorhinis infection is inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ANXA2 or EGFR, but is enhanced by expression of ectopic ANXA2 or EGFR. Downstream of ANXA2 and EGFR, the NF-κB pathway is activated and mediates M. hyorhinis-driven cell migration.

Sulforaphene (4-isothiocyanato-4R-(methylsulfinyl)-1-butene), a structural analog of sulforaphane, has been found to exhibit anticancer potential against different cancers. Our aim was to investigate whether dietary isothiocyanate sulforaphene (SFE) can promote human gastric cancer (AGS) cells apoptosis and inhibit migration. Cells were treated with various concentrations of SFE and cell viability, morphology, intracellular ROS, migration and different signaling protein expressions were investigated. The results indicate that SFE decreases AGS cell viability and induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Intracellular ROS generation, dose- and time-dependent Bax/Bcl2 alteration and signaling proteins like cytochrome c, Casp-3, Casp-8 and PARP-1 higher expression demonstrated the SFE-induced apoptotic pathway in AGS cells. Again, SFE induced apoptosis also accompanied by the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) like JNK and P-38. Moreover, dose-dependent EGFR, p-ERK1/2 down-regulation and cell migration inhibition at non-toxic concentration confirms SFE activity in AGS cell migration inhibition. Thus, this study demonstrated effective chemotherapeutic potential of SFE by inducing apoptisis as well as inhibiting migration and their preliminary mechanism for human gastric cancer management. ",

In this study, we have characterized the effect of four E-cadherin germline missense mutations (T340A, A634V, P799R and V832M) in the interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We challenged the hypothesis that E-cadherin mutations perturb its ability to bind to EGFR, leading to constitutional activation of the EGFR, triggering activation of downstream effectors. We verified that missense mutations localized in the extracellular domain of the protein (T340A and A634V) exhibited reduced stability of the EGFR/E-cadherin heterodimers in contrast to germline mutations localized at the cytoplasmatic domain of the protein (P799R and V832M). We observed that cells expressing E-cadherin extracellular mutants displayed increased levels of phosphorylated EGFR upon ligand stimulation, when compared with cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin or intracellular mutants. We showed that upon treatment of E-cadherin extracellular mutant cells with the EGFR inhibitor, the increase of RhoA activation is abrogated and accompanied by decreased migratory behaviour, supporting the idea that Rho-like proteins are EGFR downstream effectors. Our results bring new insights into the understanding of the distinct in vitro behaviours observed for E-cadherin missense mutations localized in different domains of the protein.

Expression of EREG affects sensitivity to cetuximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody that inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway. The mechanism through which EREG is regulated is largely unknown, but a methyl-array study previously performed by our group revealed that EREG is methylated in gastric cancer cells. In this study, we found that EREG gene expression was low in 7 out of 11 gastric cancer cells and this downregulation was mediated by aberrant CpG methylation of the EREG promoter. Treatment with 5-aza-CdR restored EREG expression and demethylated CpG sites in the EREG promoter. Compared with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), knock-down of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) significantly increased the expression of EREG and led to the demethylation of specific CpG sites in the EREG promoter, suggesting that DNMT3b primarily regulates CpG methylation and silencing of the EREG gene. EREG methylation was observed in 30% (4/13) of human primary gastric tumor tissues we evaluated. In addition to DNA methylation, results from a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that transcriptional levels of EREG were associated with the enrichment of active histone marks (H3K4me3 and AcH3) and of a repressive mark (H3K27me2). Treatment with 5-aza-CdR dynamically increased the low occupancy of H3K4me3 and AcH3, while decreasing the high enrichment of H3K27me2, indicating that dynamic histone modifications contribute to EREG regulation in addition to DNA methylation. Finally, the combination of 5-aza-CdR and cetuximab exerted a synergistic anti-proliferative effect on gastric cancer cells. Taken together, the results of our study showed for the first time that EREG is epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer cells by aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification.",

However, it remains unclear whether gene expression levels differ among specific sites of tumors in gastric cancer.;We studied differences in gene expression levels among specific sites of primary tumors and synchronous lymph node metastases, using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens resected surgically from 48 patients with previously untreated advanced gastric cancer. Specimens were obtained by laser-captured microdissection from five regions: (1) nonneoplastic mucosa, (2) surface layer (mucosa) of the primary tumor (surface sections), (3) middle layer (submucosa) of the primary tumor (middle sections), (4) the deepest layer of the primary tumor (muscularis propria or deeper) at the site of deepest invasion (deep sections), and (5) level 1 synchronous lymph node metastasis (lymph node metastases). Expression levels of the following target genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction: thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α).;TP, DPD, EGFR, and HIF1α gene expression levels were significantly higher in deep sections than in surface sections. TP, EGFR, VEGF, and HIF1α gene expression levels were significantly higher in lymph node metastases than in surface sections. TP, DPD, EGFR, VEGF, and HIF1α gene expression levels were positively correlated with the specific samples harvested from the tumors.;Our results show that the expression levels of some genes in tumor cells can change in specific sites of tumors and can become higher in association with tumor progression.",

In advanced and metastatic gastric cancer, the conventional chemotherapy with limited efficacy shows an overall survival period of about 10 months. Patient specific and effective treatments known as personalized cancer therapy is of significant importance. Advances in high-throughput technologies such as microarray and next generation sequencing for genes, protein expression profiles and oncogenic signaling pathways have reinforced the discovery of treatment targets and personalized treatments. However, there are numerous challenges from cancer target discoveries to practical clinical benefits. Although there is a flood of biomarkers and target agents, only a minority of patients are tested and treated accordingly. Numerous molecular target agents have been under investigation for gastric cancer. Currently, targets for gastric cancer include the epidermal growth factor receptor family, mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor axis, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathways. Deeper insights of molecular characteristics for gastric cancer has enabled the molecular classification of gastric cancer, the diagnosis of gastric cancer, the prediction of prognosis, the recognition of gastric cancer driver genes, and the discovery of potential therapeutic targets. Not only have we deeper insights for the molecular diversity of gastric cancer, but we have also prospected both affirmative potentials and hurdles to molecular diagnostics.

As gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for these patients. However, no standard palliative chemotherapy regimen has been accepted for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Palliative chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine, platin compounds, docetaxel and epirubicin prolongs survival, and improves a high quality of life to a greater extent than best supportive care. The number of clinical investigations associated with targeted agents has recently increased. Agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been widely tested. Trastuzumab was the first target drug developed, and pivotal phase III trials showed improved survival when trastuzumab was integrated into cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy was thus approved to be a new standard of care for patients with HER2-positive advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Thus, the evaluation of HER2 status in all patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma should be considered. Other agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, mammalian target of rapamycin, and other biological pathways have also been investigated in clinical trials, but showed little impact on the survival of patients.

Cell cycle distribution analysis revealed that G0-G1 arrest was not induced by exposure to 9-cis-RA in the sensitive TMK-1 and KATO-III cells or the resistant MKN-7 cells. Interestingly, 9-cis-RA temporarily increased the amount of the cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1/p21 protein, and also reduced the amount of cdk-7, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclin D1 proteins, followed by reduction in phosphorylation of the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (Rb) in the sensitive TMK-1 cells, but not in the resistant MKN-7 cells. These results suggest that 9-cis-RA has a cytostatic effect on gastric cancer cells that synthesize the receptor molecules through cell cycle regulatory machinery.",

The majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and chemotherapy represents the only possible therapeutic approach. However, chemotherapy seems to have reached an efficacy plateau in this setting. Gastric cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease because it emerges from multiple interactions of genetic, environmental and host factors. A better understanding of its molecular characteristics may lead to an improvement of outcomes. The recent molecular classification by The Cancer Genome Atlas project divides gastric cancer into four subtypes that could be taken into consideration in future clinical trials with targeted agents. So far trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody addressing the HER2 receptor, is the only targeted agent approved in the first-line setting, but only in patients overexpressing HER2. Negative data have been obtained in first-line therapy when antiangiogenics, anti-EGFR or anti-MET monoclonal antibodies have been studied in randomised controlled trials. Ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody binding to VEGFR2, is the only antiangiogenic agent currently recommended in patients progressing after first-line treatment. In this review, we discuss whether personalised therapy may have a role in gastric cancer. ",

In the western world, it is most often diagnosed at an advanced stage, after becoming metastatic at distant sites. Patients with advanced disease (locally advanced or metastatic) have a somber prognosis, with a median overall survival of 10-12 mo, and palliative chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. In recent years, novel approaches using inhibition of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with overexpression of HER2. In addition, both second-line chemotherapy and treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-inhibitor ramucirumab demonstrated significant benefits in terms of overall survival, compared with best supportive care, in randomized studies. Moreover, ramucirumab in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated further significant benefits in terms of progression-free and overall survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in second-line treatment for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. A recently published molecular classification of gastric cancer is expected to improve patient stratification and selection for clinical trials and provide a roadmap for future drug development. Nevertheless, despite these developments the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer remains poor.

High expression of receptor type tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has repeatedly represented poor prognosis for cancers. However it has not been demonstrated whether RTKs have prognostic relevance for stage II/III gastric cancer with standard treatment. Tumor tissues were obtained from 167 stage II/III advanced gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery and received postoperative S-1 chemotherapy from 2000 to 2010. Expression of the RTKs including EGFR, HER2, HER3, IGF-1R, and EphA2 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Analysis using a multivariate proportional hazard model identified the most significant RTKs that represented independent prognostic relevance. When tumor HER3 expression was classified into IHC 1+/2+ (n = 98) and IHC 0 (n = 69), the cumulative 5-year Relapse Free Survival (5y-RFS) was 56.5 and 82.9%, respectively (P = 0.0034). Significant prognostic relevance was similarly confirmed for IGF-1R (P = 0.014), and EGFR (P = 0.030), but not for EphA2 or HER2 expression. Intriguingly, HER3 expression was closely correlated with IGF-1R (P < 0.0001, R = 0.41), and EphA2 (P < 0.0001, R = 0.34) expression. Multivariate proportional hazard model analysis identified HER3 (IHC 1+/2+) (HR; 1.53, 95% CI, 1.11-2.16, P = 0.0078) as the sole RTK that was a poor prognostic factor independent of stage. Of the 53 patients who recurred, 40 patients (75.5%) were HER3-positive. Thus, of the RTKs studied, HER3 was the only RTK identified as an independent prognostic indicator of stage II/III advanced gastric cancer with standard treatment. ",

We evaluated whether the number of tissue blocks analyzed or the antibodies used may influence the immunohistochemical results in gastrectomy specimens. Clinicopathologic data from 148 patients receiving gastric surgery for cancer were collected. One tissue block for each of 88 primary tumors and 60 paired primary tumors and metastases was examined for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status by immunohistochemistry using 3 different antibodies (HercepTest, CB11, and 4B5) and by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Two additional tissue blocks of the primary tumor were tested by immunohistochemistry if the results were negative on the first tissue block. The concordance among the 3 antibodies was 94.5% (testing 1 tissue block). Two cases showed a clinically significant discrepancy between primary tumor (score 0) and lymph nodes metastases (score 3+). Additional block analysis increased both the sensitivity (from 63% to 83%) and the accuracy (from 91% to 94%) of immunohistochemistry as compared with fluorescent in situ hybridization. The multiblock approach could potentially identify a greater number of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive gastric cancers, particularly those with higher levels of intratumor heterogeneity. In turn, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity correlated with a worse prognosis (P=.011) and was an independent variable in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.57). In conclusion, testing more than 1 tissue block of cancer from specimens of gastric resection provides a more reliable human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 assessment regardless of the antibody used.",

Surgical treatment is the only therapeutic modality that has a potentially curative effect. According to certain criteria, early gastric cancer limited to the mucosa or submucosa is indicated for endoscopic mucosal resection. In advanced gastric cancer with surgical approach, the questions of type of resection, extent of lymph node dissection and indication for splenectomy do arise. R0 resection represented with macroscopic- and microscopic-free resection margins is the ultimate goal for a surgeon. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in stage IV for unresectable disease. According to numerous randomized controlled trials, adjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy have been accepted for stages Ib-IIIb of this disease. Combination chemotherapy seems to be more effective than monotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered with the aim to downstage a locally advanced tumor prior to attempting curative resection. New therapeutic possibilities include agents like angiogenesis inhibitors, human epidermal growth factor receptor family inhibitors and inhibitors of small molecules (tyrosine kinase inhibitors).

Clinical trials using lapatinib in HER2-positive gastric cancer are also currently underway. As with other molecularly targeted agents, the emergence of acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment is an imminent therapeutic problem for HER2-positive gastric cancer. In order to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment in gastric cancer, we generated lapatinib-resistant gastric cancer cell lines (SNU216 LR) in vitro by chronic exposure of a HER2-positive gastric cancer cell line (SNU216) to lapatinib. The resultant SNU216 LR cells were also resistant to gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab, afatinib and dacomitinib. Interestingly, SNU216 LR cells displayed an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and maintained the activation of MET, HER3, Stat3, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the presence of lapatinib. Using gene expression arrays, we identified the upregulation of a variety of EMT-related genes and extracellular matrix molecules, such as Testican-1, in SNU216 LR cells. We showed that the inhibition of Testican-1 by small interfering RNA decreased Testican-1-induced, MET-dependent, downstream signaling, and restored sensitivity to lapatinib in these cells. Furthermore, treatment with XAV939 selectively inhibited β-catenin-mediated transcription and Testican-1-induced EMT signaling, leading to G1 arrest. Taken together, these data support the potential role of EMT in acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment in HER2-positive gastric cancer, and provide insights into strategies for preventing and/or overcoming this resistance in patients.

Fluoropyrimidines include 5-fluorouracil(5-FU), S-1, and capecitabine. There has been an accumulation of data showing the non-inferiority of oxaliplatin to cisplatin. Moreover, the importance of salvage chemotherapy has also been proven in prospective studies. However, retrospective analyses still indicate that the 5-year survival rates associated with metastatic gastric cancer are only a few percent with chemotherapy. To improve survival, newer triplet regimens, such as a combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and S-1(DCS)and modified folinic acid, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan(modified FOLFOXIRI), are now under clinical investigation. Despite the limitations of retrospective data, surgical resection for gastric cancer liver metastases appears to be beneficial in carefully selected patients.

Several MET inhibitors have recently entered clinical trials; however, as with other molecularly targeted agents, resistance is likely to develop. Therefore, elucidating possible mechanisms of resistance is of clinical interest. We hypothesized that collateral growth factor receptor pathway activation can overcome the effects of MET inhibition in MET-amplified cancer cells by reactivating key survival pathways. Treatment of MET-amplified GTL-16 and MKN-45 gastric cancer cells with the highly selective MET inhibitor PHA-665752 abrogated MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, resulting in cyclin D1 loss and G(1) arrest. PHA-665752 also inhibited baseline phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-3, which are transactivated via MET-driven receptor cross-talk in these cells. However, MET-independent HER kinase activation using EGF (which binds to and activates EGFR) or heregulin-beta1 (which binds to and activates HER-3) was able to overcome the growth-inhibitory effects of MET inhibition by restimulating MEK/MAPK and/or PI3K/AKT signaling, suggesting a possible escape mechanism. Importantly, dual inhibition of MET and HER kinase signaling using PHA-665752 in combination with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib or in combination with inhibitors of MEK and AKT prevented the above rescue effects. Our results illustrate that highly targeted MET tyrosine kinase inhibition leaves MET oncogene-\"addicted\" cancer cells vulnerable to HER kinase-mediated reactivation of the MEK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, providing a rationale for combined inhibition of MET and HER kinase signaling in MET-amplified tumors that coexpress EGFR and/or HER-3.",

The efficacy of hertuzumab-MC-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE (hertuzumab-vcMMAE) on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive human gastric cancer cells, NCI-N87, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The cytotoxicity of hertuzumab was significantly enhanced after conjugation with MMAE.

After conjugation with MMAE, the binding specificity for HER2 was not affected. Furthermore, the internalization of hertuzumab-vcMMAE in HER2 positive gastric cancer cells was verified. Although the conjugation of hertuzumab and MMAE decreased the ADCC effect, the overall cytotoxicity was dramatically increased in HER2 positive gastric cancer cells. In vitro data on this hertuzumab-vcMMAE has exerted much stronger antitumor activity compared to trastuzumab-DM1 in HER2 positive gastric cancer cells.

Tyrosine phosphorylation in NUGC-4 was strongly activated by treatment with epidermal growth factor and quickly reduced by the acid treatment which is effective in removing growth factors from cellular surface receptors. On the contrary, phosphorylation in MKN-45 did not respond to either growth factor or acid treatment. These results suggest that NUGC-4 and MKN-45 have tyrosine kinases which are activated by different mechanisms but share similar substrates.",

Emerging evidence also underscores the importance of signaling pathways involved in the developmental process, including transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein signaling, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, Hedgehog signaling and Notch signaling.

Here, we demonstrate that linifanib (ABT-869), a novel multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, markedly augments cytotoxicity of chemotherapies in human gastric cancer. ABT-869 and chemotherapeutic agents exhibited a strong synergy to inhibit the viability of several gastric cancer cell lines, with combination index values ranging from 0.017 to 0.589. Additionally, the combination of ABT-869 and chemotherapeutic agents led to remarkable suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in a preclinical gastric cancer xenograft mouse model, drug co-treatments led to increased mouse survival as well as a synergistic reduction in tumor size and the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Mechanistic studies further revealed that all of the co-treatments containing ABT-869 resulted in decreased activation of the VEGF receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor and the insulin growth factor receptor. Inhibition of these receptor tyrosine kinases consequently attenuated the activation of the downstream AKT/mTOR signaling pathway both in cultured gastric cancer cells and in gastric cancer xenografts. Collectively, our findings suggest that the addition of ABT-869 to traditional chemotherapies may be a promising strategy for the treatment of human gastric cancer. ",

Cell transfection and selection of stable cell lines and the gene and protein levels of HER2 and MMP-9 were examined to determine the molecular relationship between them in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. We demonstrated that vector-based shRNA significantly knocked down the expression of HER2 and considerably inhibited both the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. HER2 knockdown resulted in the downregulation of the expression of MMP-9, whereas HER2 overexpression improved the transcription of MMP-9 through the activation of an MMP-9 promoter. The promoter region of MMP-9 between -2500 and -2000 bp was found to be crucial for the upregulation of HER2-mediated transcription. Furthermore, a truncated promoter (-70 to +63) did not display any transcriptional activity. Cell invasion activity was almost completely inhibited when MMP-9 was knocked down. Conversely, the overexpression of MMP-9 partly rescued the invasion ability of cell strains with knockdown HER2. These findings help further understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which HER2 promotes malignancy, and suggest that targeting both HER2 and MMP-9 may be required to effectively block HER2 signaling in gastric cancer therapy.

The aim of this study is to identify the responsible receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) potentially conferring lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2+ gastric cancer and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this RTKs-induced resistance.;A functional RNAi screen targeting human RTKs and related growth factors was used to identify candidate RTKs conferring lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2+ gastric cancer cells. Independent siRNAs transfection and corresponding ligands supplement were performed to validate the effects of candidate RTKs on lapatinib sensitivity. Cross-talks of pathways involved were analyzed via Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis and cell motility were detected using FACS system and Transwell assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze protein expression in clinical samples.;MET, HER3, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1R, and INSR were identified to mediate lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2+ gastric cancer cells. Activation of these bypass RTKs attenuated lapatinib-induced apoptosis and suppression of cell motility, mechanistically because of restimulating the shared downstream AKT or ERK signaling, as well as restimulating WNT signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process. Patients' specimens revealed that these unresponsiveness-conferring RTKs were particularly enriched in the majority of patients with HER2+ gastric cancer.;MET, HER3, IGF1R, and INSR pathways activation represent novel mechanism underlying lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2+ gastric cancer.

The positive expression rate of Her-2 in cancerous tissue detected using qPCR and IHC was 11.17% (46/412) and 13.38% (57/426), respectively. The positive expression of the Her-2 protein/gene was significantly correlated with the depth of invasion and lymphatic metastasis, as well as the TNM stage (P<0.05). No significant correlation was identified between positive expression of the Her-2 protein/gene and tumor location, age, gender, differentiation degree and Lauren classification (P>0.05). The diagnostic consistency was good between the two methods (κ=0.828). The results indicate that the expression of Her-2/neu is closely associated with the development of gastric cancer. qPCR is a convenient, objective and efficient method, which may be used as an alternative to IHC or fluorescence ",

Combination therapies with HER2-targeting agents and cytotoxic agents are considered a potential therapeutic option for gastric cancer with HER2 amplification. We have now investigated the effects of combination treatment with the oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 and the HER2-targeting agents lapatinib or trastuzumab in gastric cancer cells with or without HER2 amplification. We used 5-fluorouracil (5FU) instead of S-1 for in vitro experiments, given that tegafur, a component of S-1, is metabolized to 5FU in the liver. The combination of 5FU and HER2-targeting agents synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in gastric cancer cells with HER2 amplification, but not in those without it. Lapatinib or trastuzumab also induced downregulation of thymidylate synthase (TS) expression and activity only in cells with HER2 amplification. The combination of 5FU and TS depletion by RNA interference also exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in cells with HER2 amplification. These observations thus suggest that lapatinib-induced or trastuzumab-induced downregulation of TS is responsible, at least in part, for the synergistic antitumor effect of combined treatment with 5FU and HER2-targeting agents. The antitumor effect of the combination of S-1 and HER2-targeting agents in vivo was also greater than that of either drug alone. Our preclinical findings thus indicate that the combination of S-1 and HER2-targeting agents is a promising treatment option for gastric cancer with HER2 amplification.",

In this study, we investigate clinicopathologic characteristics of RA-GCs and propose a screening algorithm for their identification. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6, key RTKs (EGFR, HER2, MET), and p53, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoding RNA, and silver in situ hybridization (SISH) for EGFR, HER2, and MET using tissue microarrays of 993 AGCs. On IHC, 157 (15.8%) 61, (6.15%), and 85 (8.56%) out of 993 cases scored 2+ or 3+ for EGFR, HER2, and MET, respectively. On SISH, 31.2% (49/157), 80.3% (49/61), and 30.6% (26/85) of 2+ or 3+ cases on IHC showed amplification of the corresponding genes. Of the 993 cases, 104 were classified as RA-GCs. RA-GC status correlated with older age (P < 0.001), differentiated histology (P = 0.001), intestinal or mixed type by Lauren classification (P < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.026), and mutant-pattern of p53 (P < 0.001). The cases were divided into four subgroups using two classification systems, putative molecular classification and histologic-molecular classification, based on Lauren classification, IHC, and SISH results. The histologic-molecular classification showed higher sensitivity for identification of RA-GCs and predicted patient prognosis better than the putative molecular classification. In conclusion, RA-GCs show unique clinicopathologic features.

Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has limited efficacy for metastatic gastric cancer, with an overall survival of approximately ten months. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled the implementation of personalized cancer therapy for high-risk patients. The use of such high-throughput technologies, including microarray and next generation sequencing, have promoted the discovery of novel targets that offer new treatment strategies for patients lacking other therapeutic options. Many molecular pathways are currently under investigation as therapeutic targets in gastric cancer, including those related to the epidermal growth factor receptor family, the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor axis, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin factors. Advances in molecular diagnostic tools further support the discovery of new molecular targets. Limitations exist, however; not all patients can be tested for biomarkers, and numerous challenges hamper implementation of targeted therapy in clinical settings. Indeed, the scale of tumor genomic profiling is rapidly outpacing our ability to appropriately synthesize all the information in order to optimally refine patient care. Therefore, clinicians must continue to educate themselves regarding new tools and frameworks, and to utilize multidisciplinary team science, comprised of oncologists, geneticists, pathologists, biologists and bioinformaticians, to successfully implement this genomic approach therapeutically.

Specific EHF siRNAs was used to determine the biologic impacts and mechanisms of altered EHF expression in vitro and in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) assays were performed to identify its downstream targets. Our results demonstrated that EHF was significantly upregulated and frequently amplified in gastric cancer tissues as compared with control subjects. Moreover, EHF amplification was positively correlated with its overexpression and significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients. We also found that EHF knockdown notably inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic potential in nude mice and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Importantly, we identified EHF as a new HER2 transcription factor and the modulator of HER3 and HER4 in gastric cancer.

We found that with the application of laser microdissection, most CNAs were detected at higher frequency than in previous studies. Notably, gain at 20q13 was detected in almost all cases (97%), suggesting that this may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. By comparing the array CGH data with expression profiles of the same samples, we showed that both genomic amplification and deletion strongly influence the expression of genes in altered genomic regions. Furthermore, we identified 125 candidate genes, consisting of 114 up-regulated genes located in recurrent regions (>10%) of amplification and 11 down-regulated genes located in recurrent regions of deletion. Up-regulation of several candidate genes, such as CDC6, SEC61G, ANP32E, BYSL and FDFT1, was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, some candidate genes were localized at genomic loci adjacent to well-known genes such as EGFR, ERBB2 and SMAD4, and concordantly deregulated by genomic alterations.

Furthermore, Spearman rank correlation analysis also showed no correlation of YAP1 with EGFR, Ki-67, CD34 and topoisomerase II (TOP II). Taken together, YAP1 is highly expressed in GC tissues compared with the dysplasia and CG tissues and its expression level is elevated with the ascending order of tumor malignancy; but, YAP1 expression does not correlate with the clinicopathologic characteristics and the expression of EGFR, Ki-67, CD34 and TOP II in GC.",

Lymph node ratio-based N system (Nr) has been repeatedly reported to be of prognostic relevance in advanced gastric cancer independent of stage in the multivariate analysis world-wide, and proposed as more sophisticated than N with regard to predicting accurate prognosis. As a result, proposed TNrM system may predict survival more accurately than the present TNM staging system for patients undergoing limited lymph node analysis. It could adjust stage migration when the lymph node number was used as staging factor. Although correlation of the number of metastatic lymph nodes and lymph node ratio is obvious, biological characteristics other than that could also have been reflected on. It may indicate how successful the operation of lymph node dissection was, or it may be revealing the potential of the patient's lymph node immune-reaction. Recently, high lymph node ratio is closely associated with EGFR expression in advanced gastric cancer. When efficiency of applying lymph node ratio as a biomarker is verified and confirmed in an expansive research, and when cancer causing molecules are identified, as well as the competence as a treatment target is studied, the new biomarker, namely, lymph node ratio, could find itself in a limelight in gastric cancer treatment in the future.

However, this still needs confirmation in a large, prospective, well-designed phase III study.

However, 54% of patients appeared to have had suboptimal surgery. The fact that adjuvant therapy reduced locoregional (and not distant) relapse suggests that its benefit may lie in compensating for inadequate dissection. Combined modality therapy was associated with moderate toxicity, but a high requirement for changes in radiation planning. Therefore, the role and feasibility of adjuvant radiotherapy needs to be confirmed in patients operated on in Western Europe. Several approaches to the development of early systemic therapy in gastric cancer are being pursued. These include the evaluation of cisplatin-based adjuvant regimens, the use of neoadjuvant treatment, the incorporation into adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens of newer cytotoxics such as docetaxel and irinotecan, and the assessment of novel, molecularly targeted agents such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and angiogenesis inhibitors.",

Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry were used to determine the localization of HMGB1 in gastric cancer tissues, four gastric carcinoma cell lines (BGC-823, SGC-7901, MKN-28 and MKN-45) and a gastric epithelial cell line GES-1. Western blot analysis and ELISA were used to assess the effects of gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, on autophagy and HMGB1 release in BGC-823 cells. MTT assay and western blot analysis assessed the effects of extracellular HMGB1 on cell proliferation and signaling transduction. Released HMGB1 promoted proliferation through activation of ERK1/2 MAPK. HMGB1 expression in gastric cancer tissues and serum was significantly increased compared to the controls and healthy serum. Gastric carcinoma cells showed an increased HMGB1 in the nuclei and cytoplasm, whereas GES-1 cells exhibited a lower HMGB1 with nuclear localization. Gefitinib increased autophagy and cytoplasmic HMGB1 release from the BGC-823 cells. Extracellular HMGB1 in autophagic cell supernatant promoted proliferation that was abolished by glycyrrhizic acid, an HMGB1 inhibitor. BGC-823 cells incubated with HMGB1 had increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while levels of JNK, p38 or AKT were not affected.

Thus: the ability to modulate the functional activity of these receptors is an attractive target for diagnostic intervention. In this study we examined the effect of a well characterised tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RG13022) on the cellular proliferation and EGF activated tyrosine kinase signalling pathway of two primary gastric cell lines: MKN45 and N87. RG13022 has a dose dependent, antiproliferative effect on both gastric cell lines when grown either in serum-free conditions or in the presence of FCS. Western blotting revealed RG13022 caused an inhibition of EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFr in A431 cells and both EGFr and c-erbB-2 in MKN45 cells. No clear modulation of EGFr or c-erbB-2 phosphorylation was observed in N87 cells. In both A431 cells and N87 cells (which overexpress EGFr and c-erbB-2 respectively) exposed to EGF, MAP2 kinase immunoblot analysis resulted in the detection of a second protein band with reduced migration in SDS-PAGE. In N87 cells, this protein appeared to co-mi,orate with a strongly tyrosine phosphorylated protein, which suggests that it is a hyper-phosphorylated form of MAP2 kinase. However, treatment with RG13022, whilst inhibiting phosphorylation of this protein, did not prevent a shift in gel mobility (suggestive of activation) of MAP2 kinase in response to EGF. These findings demonstrate that the tyrphostin RG13022 inhibits cell proliferation of two primary gastric cancer cell lines. Investigation of intracellular signalling pathways suggests that alterations in intracellular signalling are responsible for the actions of RG 13022 in these cells. The biochemical analysis revealed that in N87 and A431, cells which overexpress c-erbB-2 and EGFr respectively, the tyrphostin affects the MAP2 kinase immunoreactivity and migration on SDS gels but fails to affect this protein in the MKN45 cell line. This data questions the usefulness of MAP2 kinase gel shift assays as markers of activation but supports the further development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as potential inhibitors of gastric tumour proliferation.",

EGFR was found to be overexpressed in 60-86% of gastric or gastroesophageal tumors and in 50-70% of esophageal cancers. Cetuximab was shown to be a radiosensitizing agent in the treatment of ENT neoplasia. These results led to several phase II encouraging therapeutic trials evaluating the combination of cetuximab with radiochemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancers. Numerous encouraging phase II trials evaluating cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction cancer were reported. These promising results are still to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III trials. Several studies reported HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer (7-34%), which appeared to be associated with poorer prognosis. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular HER2 domain. The international phase III trial known as ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile of trastuzumab in combination with first-line chemotherapy in HER2-overexpressing gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. Angiogenesis is an essential step in the initial phase of tumorigenesis, and it is normally absent from healthy tissues except for particular physiological situations, such as wound healing. VEGF-A plays a role in endothelial growth and angiogenesis. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF-A antibody, is currently being studied for gastric cancer.

Since RTKs exhibit a high level of conservation in their molecular structure, we hypothesized that PKG II may exert a similar inhibitory effect on the activation of other members of the RTK family. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential inhibitory effect of PKG II on the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). The AGS gastric cancer cell line was transfected with adenoviral vector encoding PKG II cDNA (Ad-PKG II) to increase the expression of PKG II and incubated with 8-pCPT-cGMP to activate the kinase. The cells were then stimulated with VEGF, PDGF and IGF-1, and the phosphorylation/activation of relative RTKs was detected by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that stimulating cells with VEGF-C (100 ng/ml), PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml) and IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) for 5 min led to a clear increase of phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Tyr 951), PDGFRβ (Tyr 751) and IGF-1R (Tyr 1161), respectively.

        "Doc_abstract":"Multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes, tumour-suppressor genes, cell-cycle regulators, cell adhesion molecules, DNA repair genes and genetic instability as well as telomerase activation are implicated in the multistep process of human stomach carcinogenesis. However, particular combinations of these alterations differ in the two histological types of gastric cancer, indicating that well-differentiated or intestinal-type and poorly differentiated or diffuse-type carcinomas have distinct carcinogenetic pathways. In the multistep process of well-differentiated-type carcinogenesis, the genetic pathway can be divided into three subpathways: an intestinal metaplasia-->adenoma-->carcinoma sequence, an intestinal metaplasia-->carcinoma sequence and de novo. In the multistep process of well-differentiated-type or intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis, infection with Helicobacter pylori may be a strong trigger for hyperplasia of hTERT-positive 'stem cells' in intestinal metaplasia. Genetic instability and hyperplasia of hTERT-positive stem cells precede replication error at the D1S191 locus, DNA hypermethylation at the D17S5 locus, pS2 loss, RARbeta loss, CD44 abnormal transcripts and p53 mutation, all of which accumulate in at least 30% of incomplete intestinal metaplasias. All of these epigenetic and genetic alterations are common events in intestinal-type gastric cancer. An adenoma-->carcinoma sequence is found in about 20% of gastric adenomas with APC mutations. In addition to these events, p53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), reduced p27 expression, cyclin E expression and the presence of c-met 6.0-kb transcripts allow malignant transformation from the above precancerous lesions to intestinal-type gastric cancer. DCC loss, APC mutations, 1q LOH, p27 loss, reduced tumour growth factor (TGF)-beta type I receptor expression, reduced nm23 expression and c-erbB gene amplification are frequently associated with an advanced stage of intestinal-type gastric cancer. The de-novo pathway for carcinogenesis of well-differentiated gastric cancer involves LOH and abnormal expression of the p73 gene that is responsible for the development of foveolar-type gastric cancers with pS2 expression. On the other hand, LOH at chromosome 17p, mutation or LOH of p53 and mutation or loss of E-cadherin are preferentially involved in the development of poorly differentiated gastric cancers. In addition to these changes, gene amplification of K-sam, and c-met and p27 loss as well as reduced nm23 obviously confer progression, metastasis and diffusely productive fibrosis. Mixed gastric carcinomas composed of well-differentiated and poorly differentiated components exhibit some but not all of the molecular events described so far for each of the two types of gastric cancer. Besides these genetic and epigenetic events, well-differentiated and poorly differentiated gastric cancers also organize different patterns of interplay between cancer cells and stromal cells through the growth factor/cytokine receptor system, which plays an important role in cell growth, apoptosis, morphogenesis, angiogenesis, progression and metastasis. Meta-analysis of epidemiological studies and animal models show that both intestinal and diffuse types of gastric cancer are equally associated with H. pylori infection. However, H. pylori infection may play a role only in the initial steps of gastric carcinogenesis. Differences in H. pylori strain, patient age, exogenous or endogenous carcinogens and genetic factors such as DNA polymorphism and genetic instability may be implicated in two distinct major genetic pathways for gastric carcinogenesis.",

Since the successful targeting of amplified ERBB2 with a humanized monoclonal antibody, the amplified genes of other receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, FGFR2, and MET, as well as those of other cell regulator genes, are being considered as candidate targets of molecular therapy. The aim of the present study was to determine the amplification status of 26 genes, which are frequently amplified in solid cancers, in advanced gastric cancers. A total of 93 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded advanced gastric cancer tissues were examined by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification, and 32 cases with 'gain' or 'amplified' status of 16 genes were further examined for the respective gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and for the respective protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The frequencies of gene amplifications in advanced gastric cancers were as follows: ERBB2 (13 cases, 14%), FGFR2 (7 cases, 8%), MYC (7 cases, 8%), TOP2A (7 cases, 8%), MET (4 cases, 4%), MDM2 (4 cases, 4%), CCND1 (3 cases, 3%), FGF10 (2 cases, 3%), and EGFR (1 case, 1%). Amplification of the receptor tyrosine kinases genes occurred in a mutually exclusive manner except for one tumor in which ERBB2 and FGFR2 were both amplified but in different cancer cells. Co-amplification of ERBB2 and MYC, and EGFR and CCND1, in single nuclei but on different amplicons, was confirmed in one case each. Attempts at correlating the FISH status with the immunohistochemical staining pattern showed variable results from complete concordance to no correlation. In conclusion, combination of multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification and FISH analysis is a feasible approach for obtaining the semi-comprehensive genetic information that is necessary for personalized molecular targeted therapy.

Despite recent progress in diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, prognosis remains poor. A better understanding of GC biology and signaling pathways is expected to improve GC therapy, and the integration of targeted therapies has recently become possible and appears to be promising. This article focuses on anti-Her-2 therapy, specifically trastuzumab, as well as other epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists such as cetuximab, panitumub, matuzumab, nimotzumab, gefitinib, and erlotinib. Additionally, drugs that target angiogenesis pathways are also under investigation, particulary bevacizumab, ramucirumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, and cediranib. Other targeted agents in preclinical or early clinical development include mTOR inhibitors, anti c-MET, polo-like kinase 1 inhibitors, anti-insulin-like growth factor, anti-heat shock proteins, and small molecules targeting Hedgehog signaling.",

However, little is known about HER2 in gastric cancer. In this study, we explored the pharmacological activities of natural triterpenoid corosolic acid (CRA) in HER2 signaling and its role in gastric cancer development and progression. In this study, CRA dramatically inhibited HER2 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, effectively inhibited cell proliferation, and induced G(0)/G(1) arrest through the induction of p27(kip1) and cyclin D(1) down-regulation. CRA exposure enhanced apoptotic cell death, as confirmed by caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage activities. CRA inhibited signaling pathways downstream of HER2, including phospho-proteins such as Akt and Erk. In addition, CRA combined with adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil enhanced this growth inhibition, but not with docetaxel and paclitaxel. These findings demonstrate that CRA suppresses HER2 expression, which in turn promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death of gastric cancer cells, providing a rationale for future clinical trials of CRA in the treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancers.",

The prognostic value of HER2 in gastric cancer remains controversial. Intestinal type gastric cancer has better prognosis and higher HER2 positive proportion. What is the interaction between these two factors? We hypothesized that a combination of Lauren-classification and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status (L-H status) might be more meaningful than either factor alone.;We collected 838 gastric cancer patients at all stages who had received treatment in our cancer center. This study was registered in the website of ClinicalTrials.Gov, with the number NCT01927146. We divided the patients into six groups according to their L-H status: Group A, HER2 negative and intestinal type; Group B, HER2 positive and intestinal type; Group C, HER2 negative and diffuse type; Group D, HER2 positive and diffuse type; Group E, HER2 negative and mixed type; and Group F, HER2 positive and mixed type.;Diffuse type and intestinal type accounted for 51.0% and 33.9%, respectively. The proportion of HER2 positive patients was 11.2%, 25.4%, 2.1% and 10.2% in the whole patient group, intestinal, diffuse and mixed type, respectively. Median overall survival was 34.0 months, 25.3 months, 27.6 months, 19.2 months, 25.9 months and 26.4 months in the six groups patients, P = 0.053. There was a significant difference in survival among the first four groups (P < 0.001). HER2 was an independent prognostic factor in the intestinal type and in stage I + II patients, but not in the diffuse type or stage III + IV patients. L-H status was an independent prognostic factor in patients at all stages. For the diffuse and intestinal types, the multivariate analysis showed that HER2 was not an independent prognostic factor, while Lauren classification and L-H status were. Moreover, L-H status was a better prognostic factor than the Lauren classification.;L-H status is a prognostic factor in diffuse and intestinal type patients, but not in the mixed type. Patients with HER2 negative and intestinal type had the best survival, while patients with HER2 positive status and diffuse type had the worst survival.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) pathway plays a pivotal role in the progression of human gastric cancer. The angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be induced by EGF in various cancer cell lines. Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) acts as a coreceptor for VEGF-165 and increases its affinity for VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) in endothelial cells. Furthermore, NRP-1 has been found to be expressed by tumour cells and has been shown to enhance tumour angiogenesis and growth in preclinical models. We examined the expression of NRP-1 mRNA and EGF-R protein in seven human gastric cancer cell lines. NRP-1 expression was expressed in five of seven cell lines, and EGF-R expression closely mirrored NRP-1 expression. Moreover, in EGF-R-positive NCI-N87 and ST-2 cells, EGF induced both NRP-1 and VEGF mRNA expression. C225, a monoclonal antibody to EGF-R, blocked EGF-induced NRP-1 and VEGF expression in NCI-N87 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment of NCI-N87 cells with EGF resulted in increases in phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Akt, and P38. Blockade of the Erk, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt, or P38 pathways in this cell line prevented EGF induction of NRP-1 and VEGF. These results suggest that regulation of NRP-1 expression in human gastric cancer is intimately associated with the EGF/EGF-R system. Activation of EGF-R might contribute to gastric cancer angiogenesis by a mechanism that involves upregulation of VEGF and NRP-1 expression via multiple signalling pathways.",

The target gene of microRNA-218, epidermal growth factor receptor-coamplified and overexpressed protein (ECOP) encoded by the VOPP1 gene, has been implicated in tumorigenesis. However, few studies on expression and function of ECOP in gastric cancer have been reported. ECOP expression was determined in matched normal and gastric adenocarcinoma tissue specimens by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Subsequently, ectopic overexpression and RNAi-mediated silencing of VOPP1 was effected in the human gastric cancer cell line, AGS. Proliferation and migration of parental, VOPP1 overexpressing and VOPP1-silenced AGS cells were evaluated by cell proliferation assay and scratch wound-healing motility assay. Finally, intracellular localization of ECOP in AGS cells was assessed by green fluorescent protein tagging and fluorescent microscopy. Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed overexpression of ECOP in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues compared to matched normal tissue specimens. Ectopic overexpression and RNAi-mediated silencing of VOPP1 promoted and inhibited, respectively, cell proliferation and migration in AGS cells. Intracellular localization of ECOP in perinuclear lysosomes mimicked colocalization earlier reported for other cancerous cells.

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of metformin on human gastric cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and to study microRNAs (miRNA) associated with antitumor effect of metformin. We used MKN1, MKN45, and MKN74 human gastric cancer cell lines to study the effects of metformin on human gastric cancer cells. Athymic nude mice bearing xenograft tumors were treated with or without metformin. Tumor growth was recorded after 4 weeks, and the expression of cell-cycle-related proteins was determined. In addition, we used miRNA array tips to explore the differences among miRNAs in MKN74 cells bearing xenograft tumors treated with or without metformin in vitro and in vivo. Metformin inhibited the proliferation of MKN1, MKN45, and MKN74 in vitro. Metformin blocked the cell cycle in G(0)-G(1)in vitro and in vivo. This blockade was accompanied by a strong decrease of G(1) cyclins, especially in cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4, Cdk6 and by a decrease in retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation. In addition, metformin reduced the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in vitro and in vivo. The miRNA expression was markedly altered with the treatment of metformin in vitro and in vivo. Various miRNAs altered by metformin also may contribute to tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.",

With TPT, DT-13 promoted EGFR ubiquitin--mediated degradation through myosin IIA-induced and Src/ caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-induced endocytosis of EGFR; inhibited EGFR downstream signalling and then increased the pro-apoptotic effects. Moreover, the synergistic pro-apoptotic efficacy of DT-13 and TPT in GCs with high EGFR expression was eliminated by both the NM II inhibitor (-)-blebbistatin and MYH-9 shRNA. The combination therapy of DT-13 with TPT showed stronger anti-tumour effects in vivo compared with their individual effects.

This study aimed to elucidate the profiling between gene alterations and protein expression in AGC to aid in future clinical trials on AGC.;Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 121 stage III/IV gastric cancer patients were examined for protein expression of tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs; ERBB2, EGFR, c-MET, and FGFR2) using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, 409 cancer-related genes were sequenced to detect mutations and copy number variations using NGS.;Most ERBB2 overexpression (IHC 3+) cases (80.0%) had ERBB2 amplification and did not have other RTK amplification or oncogene mutations. However, one-fourth of MET overexpression cases (25.0%) had ERBB2 alterations. EGFR and FGFR2 overexpression cases had ERBB2 alterations or other gene alterations such as KRAS or PIK3CA. On the other hand, most of the four RTK amplification cases (88.2%) were mutually exclusive with each amplification. However, RTK amplification did not simply correlate with protein overexpression, whereas cases with RTK high-level amplification had protein overexpression and rarely showed other co-existing gene alterations.;AGC involves a complicated arrangement of protein expression and gene alterations. Comprehensive analyses of NGS and IHC will be necessary to design the optimal therapy for treating the appropriate population of patients in future clinical trials.",

Pertuzumab, a HER2 dimerization inhibitor, showed prolonged progression-free survival when used with trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining T-DM1 and pertuzumab on xenografted gastric tumors. T-DM1 as a single agent showed significant antitumor activity in all the three HER2-high expression tumor models tested (NCI-N87, SCH and 4-1ST) but was ineffective against two HER2-low expression tumors (SNU-16 and MKN-28). Using the T-DM1-sensitive NCI-N87 model, the combination efficacy of T-DM1 and pertuzumab was elucidated. The combination induced significant tumor regression, whereas T-DM1 or pertuzumab alone did not. In cultured NCI-N87 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin-α, concomitant treatment of T-DM1 and pertuzumab significantly inhibited proliferation and increased caspase 3/7 activity compared to either agent alone. Only the combination significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3, and its downstream factor AKT. Suppressed HER3 phosphorylation by the combination was also seen in the NCI-N87 xenografted tumors. Compared to single agent treatments, the combination treatment significantly enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against NCI-N87 cells. These findings suggest that T-DM1 in combination with pertuzumab shows significant antitumor activity by increasing AKT signal inhibition and ADCC in HER2-positive gastric cancers. ",

However, the mechanism through which PKG II inhibits             proliferation of gastric cancer cells is still not clear. Herein, we show that             PKG II can inhibit EGF-induced MAPK signal transduction. In the gastric cancer             cell line BGC-823, the expression and activity of PKG II were increased by infecting             the cells with adenoviral construct encoding PKG II cDNA and treating the cells             with the cGMP analogue 8-pCPT-cGMP. We found that PKG II inhibited the EGF-induced             dual phosphorylation of ERK, a key component of the MAPK signal transduction pathway.             Upstream of ERK, PKG II inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, the phosphorylation/activation             of Raf-1, the activation of Ras, and the binding between adaptor protein Grb2             and GTP exchange factor Sos1 induced by EGF.

Downstream of ERK, the EGF-induced nuclear             translocation of phospho-ERK was also inhibited by PKG II. The results suggest             that PKG II inhibits the proliferation of gastric cancer cells through blocking             EGF-triggered MAPK signal transduction and the key blocking point is the tyrosine             phosphorylation of the EGF receptor.",

ILK stimulated Ras activity to activate the c-Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/ribosomal S6 kinase/inhibitor of κBα/NF-κB signaling by facilitating the formation of the IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1)-Ras complex. Forced enzymatic ILK expression promoted cell growth by facilitating ERK1/2/NF-κB signaling. PI3K activation or decreased PTEN expression prolonged ERK1/2 activation by protecting ILK from proteasome-mediated degradation. C-terminus of heat shock cognate 70 interacting protein, an HSP90-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediated ILK ubiquitination to control PI3K- and HSP90-regulated ILK stabilization and signaling.

Oncogene amplification was detected in 11 cancers, 10 of which were advanced gastric cancers and 1 was an early differentiated type. The amplification of c-erbB-2 and K-sam genes was found exclusively in differentiated- and undifferentiated-type cancers, respectively. Of the 11 cancers, 5 were DNA-diploid and 6 were DNA-aneuploid. All the 11 tumours with oncogene amplification contained polyploid cell populations (polyploidy), whereas none of the tumours without polyploidy showed oncogene amplification. In differentiated-type cancers the incidence of polyploidy was high in both early and advanced stages, while in undifferentiated-type cancers it was low in early stages but significantly higher in advanced stages. It was shown that amplification of growth factor receptor genes is closely related to the presence of polyploidy, irrespective of any different stemline DNA-ploidy mode.

Here, we report that LPA markedly enhanced SphK1 mRNA and protein in gastric cancer MKN1 cells but had no effect on SphK2. LPA also up-regulated SphK1 expression in other human cancer cells that endogenously express the LPA(1) receptor, such as DLD1 colon cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, but not in HT29 colon cancer cells or MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, which do not express the LPA(1) receptor. An LPA(1) receptor antagonist or down-regulation of its expression prevented SphK1 and S1P(3) receptor up-regulation by LPA. LPA transactivated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in these cells, and the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 attenuated the increased SphK1 and S1P(3) expression induced by LPA. Moreover, down-regulation of SphK1 attenuated LPA-stimulated migration and invasion of MNK1 cells yet had no effect on expression of neovascularizing factors, such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), or uPA receptor induced by LPA. Finally, down-regulation of S1P(3), but not S1P(1), also reduced LPA-stimulated migration and invasion of MKN1 cells.

The results also suggested that HER2 overexpression was associated with Bormann type (odds ratio (OR) = 1.76, 95% CI 1.19-2.59; Z = 2.85; P = 0.004), tumor differentiation (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.91-5.17; Z = 4.49; P = 0.000), Lauren's classification (OR = 6.25, 95% CI 4.29-9.10; Z = 9.54; P = 0.000), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.77; Z = 3.23; P = 0.001), venous invasion (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.15-2.48; Z = 2.67; P = 0.008), and lymphovascular invasion (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.21-2.04; Z = 3.4; P = 0.001). However, it had no correlation with tumor size, depth of invasion, and tumor stage. This study showed that HER2 overexpression had an unfavorable prognostic role for patients with gastric cancer. HER2-positive expression was associated with Bormann type, Lauren's classification, tumor differentiation, lymph node status, venous invasion, and lymphovascular invasion.",

HER2 gene amplification and protein expression were examined using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gastric cancer samples from all patients. For scoring, Hofmann's HER2 gastric cancer scoring system was adopted. All cases showing IHC3+ or FISH positivity were defined as HER2 positive. Patient clinicopathological data and survival information were collected. Finally, χ² statistical analysis was performed to analyze the HER2 positivity rate amongst the subgroups with different clinicopathological characteristics including; gender, age, tumor location, Lauren classification, differentiation, TNM staging, depth of invasion, lymph node metastases and distant metastasis. The probability of survival for different subgroups with different clinicopathological characteristics was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves plotted using log rank inspection.;According to Hofmann's HER2 gastric cancer scoring criteria, 31 cases (15.74%) were identified as HER2 gene amplified and 19 cases (9.64%) were scored as strongly positive for HER2 membrane staining (3+), 25 cases (12.69%) were moderately positive (2+) and 153 cases (77.66%) were HER2 negative (0/1+). The concordance rate between IHC and FISH analyses was 88.83% (175/197). Thirty-six cases were defined as positive for HER2 gene amplification and/or protein expression, with 24 of these cases being eligible for Herceptin treatment according to United States recommendations, and 29 of these cases eligible according to EU recommendations. Highly consistent results were detected between IHC3+, IHC0/1 and FISH (73.68% and 95.42%), but low consistency was observed between IHC2+ and FISH (40.00%). The positivity rates in intestinal type and well-differentiated gastric cancer were higher than those in diffuse/mixed type and poorly-differentiated gastric cancer respectively (28.57% vs 13.43%, P = 0.0103; 37.25% vs 11.64%, P < 0.0001), but were not correlated with gender, age, tumor location or TNM stage, depth of invasion, lymph node metastases and distant metastasis. In poorly-differentiated gastric cancer patients, those without lymph node metastasis showed a higher HER2 positivity rate than those with lymph node metastasis (26.47% vs 7.14%, P = 0.0021). This association was not present in those patients with well-differentiated gastric cancer (28.57% vs 43.33%, P = 0.2832). Within our patient cohort, 26 cases were lost to follow-up. The median survival time for the remaining 171 patients was 18 mo. The median survival times of the HER2 positive and negative groups were 17 and 18.5 mo respectively. Overall survival was not significantly different between HER2-positive and negative groups (χ(2) = 0.9157, P = 0.3386), but in patients presenting well-differentiated tumors, the overall survival of the HER2-positive group was significantly worse than that of the HER2-negative group (P = 0.0123). In contrast, patients with poorly differentiated and diffuse/mixed subtype gastric cancers showed no significant differences in overall survival associated with HER2. Furthermore, the median survival time of the HER2 positive group did not show any statistically significant differences when compared to the subgroups of gender, age, tumor location, TNM classification, lymph node metastases and distant metastasis.;Patients with intestinal type gastric cancer (GC), well-differentiated GC and poorly-differentiated GC without lymph node metastasis, may all represent suitable candidates for targeted therapy using Herceptin.",

Its clinical activity is currently limited by both intrinsic (natural) and acquired drug resistance. A better understanding of the underlying resistance mechanisms is needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Exposure of tumor cells to irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38 is accompanied by EGFR activation, either by stimulation of EGFR autophosphorylation or by Src-mediated phosphorylation. Accordingly, combinations of irinotecan and EGFR inhibitors have been associated with supra-additive activity. We now show that acquired resistance to SN-38 is accompanied by increased expression of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and Src proteins in two colorectal cancer cell models as well as by Src activation. One SN-38 resistant model (HT-29) showed increased sensitivity to erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, and afatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, while the other SN-38 resistant model (HCT-116) showed increased resistance to erlotinib but unchanged or increased sensitivity to afatinib. Unexpectedly, both models showed increased or unaltered resistance to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. Therefore, tyrosine kinase upregulation is not necessarily accompanied by increased sensitivity to targeted agents. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that prolonged exposure to topoisomerase I inhibitors is accompanied by upregulation of different signal transduction pathways which can alter tumor sensitivity to molecular targeted agents. These results suggest that chemotherapy exposure may lead to creation of novel targets which could be exploited therapeutically.",

Recent evidence that HER3 is responsible for tumor resistance to therapeutic agents targeting EGFR or HER2/neu, along with the new findings that HER3 is involved in the process of dedifferentiation of gastric cancer (GC) have highlighted the critical role of HER3 in cancer research. HER3 is becoming a new targeted molecule in cancer treatment. Here, we comparatively investigated the expression of HER2/neu and HER3 in gastric cancer of two pathologic types (intestinal type and diffuse type) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and analyzed the correlation between overexpression of HER2 and HER3 and clinicopathologic parameters.;An IHC study for HER2 and HER3 was performed on 102 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of GC-60 intestinal and 42 diffuse types. The correlation between overexpression of HER2 and HER3 and clinicopathologic parameters was statistically analyzed.;In the GC group, overexpression of HER2 and HER3 was detected in 19 (18.6%) and 14 (13.7%) of 102 GC patients, respectively. In a nontumorous group of 102 specimens, 5 were HER2-positive (4.9%) (18.6% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.01), and 2 were HER3-positive (2.0%) (13.7% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.01). No co-overexpression of HER2 and HER3 was observed. The intestinal type of GC exhibited a higher rate of HER2 overexpression than did the diffuse type (26.7% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.05), whereas the diffuse type of GC exhibited a significantly higher rate of HER3 overexpression than did the intestinal type (26.2% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.01). The overexpression rates of HER2 and HER3 in phase III-IV (TNM stage) disease were significantly higher than that in phase I-II disease (24.0% vs. 7.7%, p < 0.05 and 22.0% vs. 5.8%, p < 0.05, respectively).

A combination of cell viability assay, immunoblotting, and RNA interference revealed that PS-101 induced EGFR-dependent inhibition selectivity. Further studies showed that PS-101 caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, changed cell size, induced apoptosis and led to cell death by increasing the proportion of sub-G1 cells. Molecular mechanism studies suggested that blocking the EGFR-driven antiapoptotic pathway is essential for PS-101-induced apoptosis. The contribution of blocking the EGFR-driven antiapoptotic pathway was verified through examines abundance of likely candidate proteins and RNA interference. The root cause for increase in BAD and decrease in Bcl-2 which altogether initiated caspase-dependent apoptosis were predominantly due to down-regulation the expression of EGFR after PS-101 treatment. PS-101 strongly down-regulated the EGFR expression to trigger proapototic protein BAD increase and antiproapototic protein Bcl-2 decrease, which altogether actived effector caspase-3/9 to initiate cell apoptisis. Taken together, these results suggest that PS-101 may be a potential candidate for cancer therapy against human lung cancer. ",

However, no significant SNP has been identified using GWAS due to multiple testing problems. Therefore, we propose a combination method consisting of knowledge-based algorithm, two stages of screening, and permutation test for identifying SNPs in the present study. We applied this method to a genome-wide pharmacogenomics study for which 109,365 SNPs had been genotyped using Illumina Human-1 BeadChip for 119 gastric cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine. We identified rs2293347 in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is as a candidate SNP related to chemotherapeutic response. The p value for the rs2293347 was 2.19 × 10(-5) for Fisher's exact test, and the p value was 0.00360 for the permutation test (multiple testing problems are corrected). Additionally, rs2293347 was clearly superior to clinical parameters and showed a sensitivity value of 55.0% and specificity value of 94.4% in the evaluation by using multiple regression models. Recent studies have shown that combination chemotherapy of fluoropyrimidine and EGFR-targeting agents is effective for gastric cancer patients highly expressing EGFR.

The median overall survival (OS) is less than one year for advanced GC patients; thus, there is an urgent unmet need to develop novel therapy for GC.

The expression of EGFR by GECs was increased by exposure to either H. pylori, recombinant MIF, or recombinant IL-8. However, cag pathogenicity island knockout strains of H. pylori had very little effect on expression. MIF and IL-8 also induced phosphorylation of EGFR, signaling events, and proliferation during H. pylori exposure, all of which were decreased when they were neutralized by these cytokines or were blocked from their receptors.

All the patients were followed up for more than 6 months, with no confirmed deaths. The patients were dichotomized into a good and poor survival group based on cutoff points of overall survival of 12 months. A receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to test the ability of each texture parameter to identify the good survival group. Kaplan-Meier curves for patients above and below each threshold were constructed. Using a threshold of >265.8480 for contrast, >488.3150 for variance, and ≤0.1319×10-3. for correlation, all of the area under the ROC curves showed fair accuracy (>0.7). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed statistically significant survival difference between two groups according to optimal cutoff values of contrast, variance, correlation and ASM. However, as this study had a small number of patients, a further study with a larger population will be needed to validate the results.;Heterogeneous texture features on CT images were associated with better survival in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer who received trastuzumab-based treatment. Therefore, texture analysis shows potential to be a clinically useful imaging biomarker providing additional prognostic information for patient selection.",

Many molecular-targeted therapies inhibiting signaling pathways of various tyrosine kinase receptors have been developed, and monoclonal antibodies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have become standard therapy for HER2-positive GC. An inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 or MET has also produced promising results in patients with GC. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) play key roles in tumor growth via activated signaling pathways in GC. Genomic amplification of FGFR2 leads to the aberrant activation found in GC tumors and is related to survival in patients with GC. This review discusses the clinical relevance of FGFR in GC and examines FGFR as a potential therapeutic target in patients with GC. Preclinical studies in animal models suggest that multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including FGFR inhibitor, suppress tumor cell proliferation and delay tumor progression. Several TKIs are now being evaluated in clinical trials as treatment for metastatic or unresectable GC harboring FGFR2 amplification. ",

However, intrinsic or acquired drug resistance has emerged as a major challenge to their clinical use. In this study, we demonstrated that several receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), including EGFR, HER3 and MET, activations contributed to AZD4547 (a selective FGFR2 inhibitor) hyposensitivity in FGFR2 amplified GC cells. The rescue effect was abrogated by inhibiting these RTKs with their targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In addition, synergy in growth inhibition was observed when the GC cells were treated with a combination of AZD4547 and cetuximab (an EGFR monoclonal antibody) both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, tissue microarray analysis revealed that these resistance-conferring RTKs were highly expressed in FGFR2 positive GC patients. Taken together, these observations demonstrated RTKs including EGFR, HER3 and MET activations as novel mechanisms of hyposensitivity to AZD4547. It will be clinically valuable to investigate the involvement of RTK-mediated signaling in intrinsicor acquired resistance to FGFR2 TKIs in GC. A combination targeted therapeutic strategy may be recommended for treating FGFR2 amplified GC patients with these RTK activations. ",

In addition, we evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of a panel of molecular markers. Patients with histologically proven, radically resected gastric cancer, stage > or =T3 and/or N+ were randomized to 6 cycles of docetaxel with cisplatin, both at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (arm A) or the same treatment with RT (arm B; 45 Gy). Due to excessive nausea and vomiting, cisplatin was substituted by carboplatin at AUC (area under the curve) of 5 after the first 45 patients (22 group A, 23 group B). The prognostic value of EGFR, ERCC1, HER2, MET/HGFR, MAP-Tau, and PTEN expression was also studied in a subset of 67 patients using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMAs). A total of 147 patients were randomized. After a median follow-up of 53.7 months, no differences in overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were found between the two arms.

OCUM-2M was derived from a primary gastric tumour, and OCUM-2D was derived from a sample of disseminated metastasis. The two cell lines were derived from the same patient. We investigated biological differences between the two cell lines to study mechanisms involved in disseminated metastasis. The growth activity of OCUM-2D cells as determined by doubling time and tumorigenicity was greater than that of OCUM-2M cells. The level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in OCUM-2D cells was about twice that of OCUM-2M cells and the growth of OCUM-2D cells was stimulated more by epidermal growth factor (EGF) than that of OCUM-2M cells. The invasive activity of OCUM-2D cells was higher than that of OCUM-2M cells and was increased after addition of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). An increase in the number of attached and spreading cells was found following the addition of 10 ng ml-1 TGF-beta 1. These findings suggest that high growth and invasive activity may play an important role in disseminated metastasis and that EGF and TGF-beta 1, which affect the growth and invasive activity of OCUM-2D cells, might be factors associated with metastasis in scirrhous gastric carcinoma.

Peripheral blood samples were collected before surgery, and patients were re-evaluated within operation and divided into two groups: resectable and non-resectable GC. A new size-based separation test for enrichment and cultivation of CTCs was used (MetaCell(®)). In addition to cytomorphological analysis, gene expression of tumor associated genes (Cytokeratin-18, Cytokeratin-19, Cytokeratin-20, Cytokeratin-7, EPCAM, MUC1, HER2, EGFR) and of leukocyte markers (e.g. CD45, CD68) was tested in enriched CTC fractions.

The cytomorphological characterization of the CTCs was a prerequisite of random gene expression testing in CTC-positive samples.

Anti-p185(HER-2)-RTA was prepared by chemical conjugation of anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and RTA. The SGC7901-HER-2+ cells were incubated with RTA, anti-p185(HER-2)-RTA, and/or 5-flurouracil. The effects of drugs on cells were evaluated by MTT assay and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide double staining flow cytometry. The expression of caspase-3, caspase-9, cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear factor-kappaB/p65 were assayed by western blot. SGC7901-HER-2+ cells were transplanted into BALB/c nude mice to produce solid tumors in an attempt to study the immunotoxin activity in vivo.;In vitro, anti-p185(HER-2)-RTA inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in SGC7901-HER-2+ cells. Anti-p185(HER-2)-RTA enhanced caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity, while downregulating the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-kappaB/p65. Its combination with 5-flurouracil further inhibited the growth of SGC7901-HER-2+ cells. In vivo, our data showed that anti-p185(HER-2)-RTA significantly inhibited the growth of SGC7901-HER-2+ cells-transplanted tumors.;Anti-p185(HER-2)-RTA inhibits the growth of SGC7901-HER-2+ cells. The effect may be related to the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-kappaB/p65. Anti-p185(HER-2)-RTA plus 5-FU enhance anti-cancer activity, suggesting useful clues for further study for the treatment of HER-2 positive gastric cancers.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lymphatic metastasis is commonly observed in gastric cancer (GC), but hematogenous metastasis is more likely responsible for the cancer-related mortality. Since Stephen Paget first introduced the \"seed and soil hypothesis\" a century ago, growing evidence recognizes that numerous essential secreted factors and signaling pathway effectors participate in the pre-metastatic niche formation and distant organ metastasis. The cross-talk between GC cells and surrounding microenvironment may consist of a series of interrelated steps, including epithelial mesenchymal transition, intravasation into blood vessels, circulating tumor cell translocation, and secondary organ metastasis. Secreted factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases and cancer-derived extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes, are essential in formation of premetastatic niche. Circulating tumor cells and microRNAs represent as ''metastatic intermediates'' between primary tumors and sites of dissemination. Many biomarkers have been identified as novel metastatic markers and prognostic effectors. In addition, molecular therapy has been designed to target biomarkers such as growth factors (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, VEGF) and chemokines, although they have not clearly proven to be effective in inhibiting GC metastasis in clinical trials. In this review, we will systematically discuss the emerging molecules and their microenvironment in hematogenous metastasis of GC, which may help us to find new therapeutic strategies in the future.

The results show that Akt activation requires the phosphorylation of T308 in the A-loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and S473 within the HM by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase complex 2 (mTORC2: Rictor, mLST8, mSin1, mTOR kinase) with participation neither of G(i)(/o)-protein nor Gbetagamma dimers. Obestatin induces the association of GPR39/beta-arrestin 1/Src signalling complex resulting in the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream Akt signalling. Upon administration of obestatin, phosphorylation of mTOR (S2448) and p70S6K1 (T389) rise with a time course that parallels that of Akt activation.

We studied the relationship between clinicopathological factors, biological markers (p53, ki67, nm23, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), E-cadherin (E-cad), beta-catenin (b-catenin), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and topoisomerase II (Topo II)), and LNM of EGC patients by chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Meta-analyses were further conducted to review the effects of the proteins (P53, ki67, E-cad, and b-catenin) on LNM in ECG patients. LNM was detected in 42 (18.3 %) of 230 patients. Incidences of LNM was distinct in different tumor size (p = 0.044), depth of submucosal invasion (p < 0.0001), and P53 overexpression (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis further indentified that large tumor size (≥20 mm, odds ratio (OR) = 2.168, p = 0.041), submucosa (OR = 4.000, p = 0.0005), and P53 overexpression (OR = 3.010, p = 0.022) were independent risk factors of LNM in EGC patients. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly statistical association of P53, ki67, and b-catenin with an increased risk of LNM in EGC patients (P53, OR = 1.81, p = 0.017; ki67, OR = 2.53, p = 0.0003; b-catenin, OR = 0.53, p = 0.01). Tumor size (≥20 mm), the depth of invasion (submucosa), and P53 overexpression may be helpful predictors of LNM in EGC patients.

In addition, non-ERBB2-expressing patient samples were selected as comparison to study the effect of expression of this oncogene. We detected 196 proteins in ERBB2-positive patient tumor samples that had minimal overlap (29 proteins) with the non-ERBB2 tumor samples.

However, unsatisfactory results of recent phase III clinical trials involving lapatinib suggested biomarkers for selection of patients. The aim of this study was to identify JWA as a biomarker for lapatinib resistance in GC cells and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Lapatinib was effective to the intrinsic cisplatin-resistant GC cells. JWA activation conferred lapatinib unresponsiveness, but reversed cisplatin resistance in GC cells. Whereas, deletion of JWA significantly restored lapatinib suppression on proliferation and lapatinib-induced apoptosis. JWA-induced down-regulation of HER2 and activation of ERK phosphorylation led to lapatinib resistance. Furthermore, c-Cbl represented a novel mechanism for HER2 degradation enhanced by JWA in GC cells. Taken together, JWA is a potential predictive marker for lapatinib resistance, targeting the patients that may benefit from lapatinib treatment in human GC.",

The subjects comprised 37 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent tissue biopsy or surgical resection of the primary sites and 49 paired synchronous or metachronous metastatic sites (excluding lymph nodes) at the Fukuoka University Hospital between January, 1998 and September, 2012. All the samples were evaluated for HER2 status at the invasive front by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The HER2 positivity rate of the primary sites was ~16% and the concordance ratio of the IHC results between primary and paired metastatic sites was ~97%. No discordant cases regarding HER2 status were found among metachronous interventions for metastatic lesions. Only one patient exhibited conversion from a HER2-negative status in all the portions of the primary site to a positive status in a metastatic site. In conclusion, a high concordance ratio for HER2 status was observed between primary and paired metastatic lesions.

After the discovery of targeted therapies, research has focused on the new treatment options for AGC. In the last two decades, many targeted molecules were developed against AGC. Currently, two targeted therapy molecules have been approved for patients with AGC. In 2010, trastuzumab was the first molecule shown to improve survival in patients with HER2-positive AGC as part of a first-line combination regimen. In 2014, ramucirumab was the second targeted molecule to improve survival rates and was suggested as treatment for patients with AGC who had progressed after first-line platinum plus fluoropyrimidine with or without anthracycline chemotherapy. Ramucirumab was the first targeted therapy acting as a single agent in patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers. Although these two molecules were introduced into clinical use, many other promising molecules have been tested in phase I-II trials. It is obvious that in the near future many different targeted therapies will be in use for treatment of AGC. In this review, the current status of targeted therapies in the treatment of AGC and gastroesophageal junction tumors, including HER (2-3) inhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, c-MET inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, agents against other molecular pathways fibroblast growth factor, Claudins, insulin-like growth factor, heat shock proteins, and immunotherapy, will be discussed.",

The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated for the eligible studies. The summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed and the area under the SROC (AUSROC) was used to evaluate overall diagnostic performance. Eight studies comprising a total of 1170 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR were 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21-0.61), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.87-1.00), and 27 (95% CI: 9-81), respectively.

Prognostic value of pathway activation patterns was determined by correlating disease-free survival times of the various GC subgroups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. CEER was also used to determine the presence of tyrosine phosphorylated signaling cascades in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and ascites tumor cells (ATCs).;Utilizing a novel diagnostics immunoassay, CEER, we demonstrate the presence of p95HER2 and concomitantly activated signaling pathways in GC tumor tissues, CTCs and ATCs isolated from GC patients for the first time. p95HER2 is expressed in ~77% of HER2(+) GCs. Approximately 54% of GCs have an activated HER1, HER2, HER3, cMET or IGF1R and demonstrate a poorer prognosis than those where these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are not activated. Hierarchical clustering of RTKs reveals co-clustering of phosphorylated HER1:cMET, HER2:HER3 and IGF1R-PI3K. Coactivation of HER1 with cMET renders GCs with a shorter disease-free survival as compared to only cMET activated GCs.;Our study highlights the utility of a novel companion diagnostics technology, CEER that has strong implications for drug development and therapeutic monitoring.

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis results showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the ErbB signaling pathway and other pathways. Additionally, the AKT/ERK signaling pathway, which is the pathway downstream of ErbB, was predicted to be active in PTX-resistant GC cell lines. ErbB3 overexpression and AKT/ERK activation in PTX-resistant cell lines were validated, respectively, by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Furthermore, 10 miRs were dramatically differently expressed in the three GC cell lines, and a miR-gene network was constructed from these data.

Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur at a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will concentrate on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will concentrate on gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift in the personalized treatment of GC patients where multiplex comprehensive screening of all GC patients for all these potential driver mutations simultaneously is performed to achieve efficiencies and timeliness in diagnosis and allowing enrollment into different molecularly targeted therapy trials and the prospective discovery of novel yet unknown actionable driver mutations.

DNA ploidy and proliferative activity, evaluated in terms of DNA index (DI) and proliferative index (PI), respectively, were determined by flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. EGF-R expression was detected by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tumor sections of the same specimens.

To shed light on this important question, we performed a systematic review and meta-analyses on each relevant targeted-pathway. By searching literature databases and proceedings of major cancer meetings in the time-frame 2005-2014, 22 randomized clinical trials exploring targeted therapy for a total of 7022 advanced gastric cancer patients were selected and included in the final analysis. Benefit was demonstrated for antiangiogenic agents in terms of overall survival (HR 0.759; 95%CI 0.655-0.880; p < 0.001). Conversely no benefit was found for EGFR pathway (HR 1.077; 95%CI 0.847-1.370; p = 0.543). Meta-analysis of HER-2 pathway confirmed improvement in terms of survival outcome, already known for this class of drugs (HR 0.823; 95%CI 0.722-0.939; p = 0.004). Pooled analysis demonstrated a significant survival benefit (OS: HR 0.823; PFS: HR 0.762) with acceptable tolerability profile for targeted-based therapies as compared to conventional treatments. This finding conflicts with the outcome of most individual studies, probably due to poor trial design or patients selection. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a significant survival benefit for targeted therapy in its whole, which can be ascribed to anti-angiogenic and anti-HER2 agents. ",

A total of 210 cases of gastric cancer who underwent curative R0 resection were registered from four independent facilities. Immunohistochemical staining for the aforementioned molecules was performed for the surgically resected specimens of the 210 cases to investigate the correlation between clinicopathological factors and expression of each molecule.;No significant correlation was observed between the immunostaining expression of any of the eight factors and postoperative recurrence. However, the expressions of p53 and MMP-7 were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS). When 210 gastric cancer patients were divided into three groups based on the expression of p53 and MMP-7 (G0 group: negative for both p53 and MMP-7, n = 69, G1 group: positive for either p53 or MMP-7, n = 97, G2 group: positive for both of the molecules, n = 44), G2 group demonstrated significantly higher recurrence rate (59%) compared to 38% in G0 (p = 0.047). The multivariate regression analysis revealed that G2 group was independently associated with a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio 1.904, 95% CI 1.098-3.303; p = 0.022), although the association with OS was not significant. Stage II patients among the G2 group had significantly inferior prognosis both in terms of OS and DFS when compared with those among the G0/G1 group, with survival curves similar to those of Stage III cases.;G-factor based on the expression of p53 and MMP-7 was found to be a promising factor to predict outcome of Stage II/III gastric cancer, and possibly to help select the treatment for Stage II cancer, thus supplementing the conventional TNM system.",

This study was designed to investigate the inhibitory effect of PKG II on the activation of c-Met and consequent biological activities. The results from CCK8 assay, Transwell assay and TUNEL assay showed that HGF enhanced cell proliferation and migration, and decreased cell apoptosis. Activated PKG II reversed the above changes caused by HGF. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting results showed that PKG II could bind with c-Met and phosphorylate its Ser985, and thereby inhibited HGF-induced activation of c-Met and MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR mediated signal transduction. When Ser985 of c-Met was mutated to Alanine for preventing phosphorylation of this site, the blocking effect of PKG II on c-Met activation was annulled. When Ser985 of c-Met was mutated to Aspartic acid for mimicking phosphorylation of this site, HGF-induced activation of c-Met was prevented. In conclusion, the results indicated that PKG II could block c-Met activation via phosphorylating Ser985 of this RTK. ",

To develop effective therapeutic treatments, a dual-targeting hybrid nanoparticle (NP) system was designed and constructed to deliver the SN38 agent specifically to human solid gastric tumors bearing excessive Her2 and CD44. The hybrid NPs consist of a particle core made of the biodegradable polymer PLGA and a lipoid shell prepared by conjugating the AHNP peptides and n-hexadecylamine (HDA) to the carboxyl groups of hyaluronic acid (HA). Upon encapsulation of the SN38 agent in the NPs, the AHNP peptides and HA on the NP surface allow preferential delivery of the drug to gastric cancer cells (e.g., HGC27 cells) by targeting Her2 and CD44. Cellular uptake and in vivo biodistribution experiments verified the active targeting and prolonged in vivo circulation properties of the dual-targeting hybrid NPs, leading to enhanced accumulation of the drug in tumors. Furthermore, the anti-proliferation mechanism studies revealed that the inhibition of the growth and invasive activity of HGC27 cells was not only attributed to the enhanced cellular uptake of dual-targeting NPs, but also benefited from the suppression of CD44 and Her2 expression by HA and AHNP moieties. Finally, intravenous administration of the SN38-loaded dual-targeting hybrid NPs induced significant growth inhibition of HGC27 tumor xenografted in nude mice compared with a clinical antitumor agent, Irinotecan (CPT-11), and the other NP formulations. These results demonstrate that the designed dual-targeting hybrid NPs are promising for targeted anti-cancer drug delivery to treat human gastric tumors over-expressing Her2 and CD44. ",

Additionally, we aimed to determine NET1-dependent transcriptomic events that occur in GC.;An in vitro model of stable knockdown of NET1 was achieved in AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells via lentiviral mediated transduction of short-hairpin (sh) RNA targeting NET1. Knockdown was assessed using quantitative PCR. Cell proliferation was assessed using an MTS assay and cell migration was assessed using a wound healing scratch assay. Cell invasion was assessed using a transwell matrigel invasion assay. Gene expression profiles were examined using affymetrix oligonucleotide U133A expression arrays. A student's t test was used to determine changes of statistical significance.;GC cells were transduced with NET1 shRNA resulting in a 97% reduction in NET1 mRNA (p < 0.0001). NET1 knockdown significantly reduced the invasion and migration of GC cells by 94% (p < 0.05) and 24% (p < 0.001) respectively, while cell proliferation was not significantly altered following NET1 knockdown. Microarray analysis was performed on non-target and knockdown cell lines, treated with and without 10 μM lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) allowing us to identify NET1-dependent, LPA-dependent and NET1-mediated LPA-induced gene transcription. Differential gene expression was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Shortlisted NET1-dependent genes included STAT1, TSPAN1, TGFBi and CCL5 all of which were downregulatd upon NET1 downregulation. Shortlisted LPA-dependent genes included EGFR and PPARD where EGFR was upregulated and PPARD was downregulated upon LPA stimulation. Shortlisted NET1 and LPA dependent genes included IGFR1 and PIP5K3. These LPA induced genes were downregulated in NET1 knockdown cells.;NET1 plays an important role in GC cell migration and invasion, key aspects of GC progression.

Through in vitro experiments, this study evaluated the effects of broth culture filtrate protein (BCF-P) from the supernatant of liquid culture media of H. pylori on proliferation and apoptosis of immortalized human gastric epithelial cell lines (GES-1) and gastric cancer cell lines (AGS).;For the study, GES-1 and AGS cell lines mix with BCF-P and epidermal growth factor (EGF).

        "Doc_abstract":"Helicobacter pylori is a helical bacterium that colonizes the stomach in over half of the world's population. Infection with this bacterium has been linked to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The bacterium has been shown to affect regulatory pathways in its host cells through specific virulence factors that control gene expression. Infection with H. pylori increases levels of phosphorylation of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (pRKIP) in gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the role of H. pylori in the phosphorylation of RKIP as a possible mechanism to downregulate pro-survival signals in gastric adenocarcinoma. pRKIP induces RKIP transcriptional activity, which serves to induce apoptosis of damaged cells to prevent further tumorigenesis. Infection of wild type and RKIP knockout mice with H. pylori for 2 months further confirmed roles of RKIP and pRKIP in the prevention of gastric cancer progression. Loss of RKIP in AGS cells results in increased expression of the Cag A virulence factor after H. pylori infection and RKIP overexpression inhibits H. pylori-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 and NF-κB transcriptional activity. We examined the role of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) after H. pylori infection on the phosphorylation of RKIP. Cells treated with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, displayed less expression of pRKIP after H. pylori infection. Microarray antibody analysis was conducted on wild-type and RKIP-knockdown AGS cells and showed that in the absence of RKIP, there was increased expression of pro-tumorigenic proteins such as EGFR, Raf-1, and MAPKs. Although further work is needed to confirm the interaction of RKIP and mTOR in AGS cells as a result of H. pylori infection, we hypothesize that H. pylori-mediated induction of pro-survival signaling in gastric epithelial cells induces a feedback response through the activation of RKIP. The phosphorylated, or active, form of RKIP is important in protecting gastric epithelial cells from tumorigenesis after H. pylori infection. ",

Addition of a chimeric monoclonal antibody against EGFR (cetuximab) to first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal tumours improved outcomes of patients (stratified for KRAS wild-type cancers), whereas GC patients did not benefit from this approach. In GC, however, stratification based on KRAS mutations was not performed, and the 30 % KRAS mutation frequency in microsatellite instable cancers (MSI), which represents ∼4 % of total GC, was disregarded. Further, intratumoural heterogeneity regarding KRAS mutant subpopulations might also contribute to anti-EGFR therapy failure. We assessed the mutational status of the entire KRAS coding sequence in 19 MSI-GC cases by multiplex PCR/sequencing and used peak height ratio determined from electropherograms from KRAS heterozygous mutants and histopathological evaluation to infer tumour heterogeneity in GC. Using 2 multiplex reactions per sample, we found that 26 % (5/19) of MSI-GC cases harboured KRAS mutations (2 G12D, 2 G13D, 1 G12V). No mutations were found outside the codon 12 and 13 hotspots. Our analysis supported the co-existence of KRAS-positive and KRAS-negative tumour populations in 4/5 MSI-GC cases. In conclusion, the method developed stands as a cost-effective and practical way for mutation screening of the entire KRAS coding sequence. KRAS mutations are frequent in our series of MSI cases and are often found in a subpopulation of the tumour and not in the whole tumour. Further studies are needed to access the implications of this heterogeneity in KRAS mutant and wild-type tumour clones in anti-EGFR therapy response.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gastric carcinoma remains one of the most prevalent forms of cancer worldwide, despite the decline in incidence rates, increased awareness of the disease and advancement in treatment strategies. Helicobacter pylori infection, dietary factors, lifestyle influences and various genetic aberrations have been shown to contribute to the development and progression of gastric cancer. Recent studies on the genomic landscape of gastric adenocarcinoma have identified several key signaling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) members, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR) members and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway components, that have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancers. However, clinical trials with compounds that target these molecules have failed to show a significant improvement in overall survival rates when supplemented with conventional therapies. Therefore, it is essential to identify effective prognostic and/or diagnostic biomarkers and develop molecular targeted therapies. The JAK/STAT cascade is a principal signal transduction pathway in cytokine and growth factor signaling, regulating various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling is a driving force in the pathogenesis of various solid cancers as well as hematopoietic malignancies. Hence, a large number of preclinical and clinical studies of drugs targeting this pathway are currently underway. Notably, aberrant JAK/STAT signaling has also been implicated in gastric cancers. In this review, we focus on the ongoing research on the JAK/STAT cascade in gastric carcinoma and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting JAK/STAT signaling for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

Eligible studies included prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating therapies with or without TAs in elderly patients with AGC. The endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Statistical analyses were conducted by using Comprehensive Meta Analysis software (Version 2.0).;A total of 1,759 elderly patients with AGC from ten RCTs were included for analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that the addition of TAs to therapies in elderly patients significantly improved OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99, p = 0.032), but not for PFS (HR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.66-1.06, p = 0.13) when compared to controls. Subgroup analysis according to targeted agents indicated that survival benefit was observed for anti-HER-2 agents (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.91, p = 0.006) and angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs) (HR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62-0.99, p = 0.04) in terms of OS. Conversely, no survival benefit was found for anti-EGFR agents in terms of OS (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 0.93-1.36, p = 0.24) and PFS (HR 1.35, 95% CI: 0.88-2.07, p = 0.17). No publication bias was detected by Begg's and Egger's tests for OS.;The findings of this study suggest that the addition of TAs to therapies in elderly patients with AGC offers an improved OS, which can be ascribed to AIs and ant-HER2 agents.

In this review, an overview of the morphological classification, current treatment approaches, and molecular alterations that have been characterized for GC are provided. In particular, the most recent molecular classification of GC and alterations identified in relevant signaling pathways, including ErbB, VEGF, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and HGF/ MET signaling pathways, are described, as well as inhibitors of these pathways. An overview of the completed and active clinical trials related to these signaling pathways are also summarized. Finally, insights regarding emerging stem cell pathways are described, and may provide additional novel markers for the development of therapeutic agents against GC. The development of more effective agents and the identification of biomarkers that can be used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and individualized therapy for GC patients, have the potential to improve the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness for GC treatments.

The carcinogenesis of this tumor provides information regarding two transcription and signaling pathways of great interest and with therapeutic potential. Infection by Helicobacter pylori is recognized as the cause of gastric cancer development, and there are two elements that play an important role in this process: the CagA gene, whose protein is introduced in the cell by H. pylori initiates the process; and the hedgehog signaling pathway, which regulates the gastric mucosa and is very frequently activated in gastric cancer.

IL-4-stimulated STAT6 activation, Arg1 and YM1 gene expression, and HB-EGF production were further enhanced by inhibition of EGFR activity in Raw 264.7 cells using an EGFR kinase inhibitor and in peritoneal macrophages from Egfr(wa5) mice with kinase inactive EGFR and by knockdown of EGFR in peritoneal macrophages from Egfr(fl/fl) LysM-Cre mice with myeloid cell-specific EGFR deletion. Chitin induced a higher level of M2 polarization in peritoneal macrophages in Egfr(fl/fl) LysM-Cre mice than that in Egfr(fl/fl) mice. Accordingly, IL-4-conditioned medium stimulated growth and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in gastric epithelial and colonic tumor cells, which were suppressed by that from Raw 264.7 cells with HB-EGF knockdown but promoted by that from Egfr(wa5) and Egfr(fl/fl) LysM-Cre peritoneal macrophages. Clinical assessment revealed that the number of macrophages with EGFR expression became less, indicating decreased inhibitory effects on M2 polarization, in late stage of human gastric cancers. Thus, IL-4-stimulated HB-EGF-dependent transactivation of EGFR in macrophages may mediate inhibitory feedback for M2 polarization and HB-EGF production, thereby inhibiting gastrointestinal tumor growth.

Here, we investigated if picking 2 paraffin blocks for Her2/neu evaluation on 1 slide is an economical, efficient, and practical method, which may reduce false negativity of Her2/neu IHC assessment due to intratumoral heterogeneity. A total of 251 gastric cancer (GC) patients were divided into a cohort using 1 tumor tissue paraffin block (single-block group, n = 132) and a cohort using dual tumor tissue paraffin blocks (dual-block group, n = 119) when evaluating Her2/neu expression status by IHC. In dual-block group, we combined the results from 2 different paraffin blocks and used the higher one as the final score. The number of IHC 1+, 2+, and 3+ specimens in the single-block group was 31 (23.5%), 40 (30.3%), and 19 (14.4%), respectively. The combined final IHC score in the dual-block group of 1+, 2+, and 3+ was 26 (21.8%), 34 (28.6%), and 23 (19.3%), respectively. Inconsistent Her2/neu expression between blocks was found in 36 (30.3%) cases in the dual-block group. The pooled data in the single-block group and the dual-block group indicated that, when using dual blocks, the Her2/neu-positive (3+) rate of GC was higher compared to that in the single-block group. Our results implied that using dual paraffin blocks to assess Her2/neu expression of GC may help identify more patients with Her2/neu-positive GC who could benefit from targeted therapy, by reducing false-negative rate of Her2 status assessment. This is an efficient, economical, and practical method for Her2/neu evaluation of GC. ",

We have discussed the scientific findings and the impact on practice guidelines and ongoing clinical trials. The report on KRAS status in patients with metastatic CRC receiving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted antibody treatment has led to a change in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline that recommends only patients with wild-type KRAS tumor should receive this treatment. The results of double biologics (bevacizumab and anti-EGFR antibody) plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic CRC has shown a worse outcome than bevacizumab-based regimen. Microsatellite Instability has again been confirmed to be an important predictor in patients with stage II colon cancer receiving adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant gemcitabine therapy for pancreatic cancer was investigated by the CONKO-001 study; this resulted in superior survival as compared with observation and can be regarded as an acceptable option, without the addition of radiotherapy. The addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine and erlotinib was not supior to gemcitabine and erlotinib for advanced disease. Second-line therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin resulted in a survival benefit. Irinotecan plus cisplatin and paclitaxel plus cisplatin result in similar survival when combined with radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. The novel fluoropyrimidine S1 appears to be active in gastric cancer, as a single agent or as combination therapy. Adjuvant intraperitoneal mitomycin-C may decrease the incidence of peritoneal recurrence of gastric cancer. Sorafenib is an effective agent in Asian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to hepatitis B; its utility in child's B cirrhosis remains to be proven. Sunitinib is also an active agent in hepatocellular carcinoma, and may represent an alterative to sorafenib for advanced disease.

The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is constitutively activated in many gastric cancers and its expression is strictly required for survival of some gastric cancer cells. Thus, MET is considered a good candidate for targeted therapeutic intervention in this type of tumor, and MET inhibitors recently entered clinical trials. One of the major problems of therapies targeting tyrosine kinases is that many tumors are not responsive to treatment or eventually develop resistance to the drugs. Perspective studies are thus mandatory to identify the molecular mechanisms that could cause resistance to these therapies.;Our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that, in MET-addicted gastric cancer cells, the activation of HER (Human Epidermal Receptor) family members induces resistance to MET silencing or inhibition by PHA-665752 (a selective kinase inhibitor). We provide molecular evidences highlighting the role of EGFR, HER3, and downstream signaling pathways common to MET and HER family in resistance to MET inhibitors. Moreover, we show that an in vitro generated gastric cancer cell line resistant to MET-inhibition displays overexpression of HER family members, whose activation contributes to maintenance of resistance.;Our findings predict that gastric cancer tumors bearing constitutive activation of HER family members are poorly responsive to MET inhibition, even if this receptor is constitutively active.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated a superficial depressed-type gastric cancer in the antrum, and abdominal computed tomography showed no evidence of distant metastases. A tumor measuring 11 mm in diameter was removed by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Since histological examinations of ESD specimens showed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the submucosal layer with lymphatic invasion, the patient subsequently underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection, resulting in no residual carcinoma and no lymph node metastasis. The patient developed solitary liver metastasis one year later and was treated with trastuzumab plus capecitabine/cisplatin since results of the immunohistochemical analysis of the resected specimens demonstrated overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The patient was alive 12 months after surgical resection of the liver metastasis and subsequently developed bone metastasis. Controversy remains over the role of HER2 status as a prognostic factor in gastric cancer. However, it has been generally reported that HER2 overexpression correlates with aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis.

In this study, we aimed to establish additional PDGCX models and to evaluate whether these models accurately reflected the histological and genetic diversities of the corresponding patient tumors. By engrafting fresh patient gastric cancer (GC) tissues into immune-compromised mice (SCID and/or nude mice), thirty two PDGCX models were established. Histological features were assessed by a qualified pathologist based on H&E staining. Genomic comparison was performed for several biomarkers including ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3, FGFR2, MET and PTEN. These biomarkers were profiled to assess gene copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All 32 PDGCX models retained the histological features of the corresponding human tumors. Furthermore, among the 32 models, 78% (25/32) highly expressed ERBB1 (EGFR), 22% (7/32) were ERBB2 (HER2) positive, 78% (25/32) showed ERBB3 (HER3) high expression, 66% (21/32) lost PTEN expression, 3% (1/32) harbored FGFR2 amplification, 41% (13/32) were positive for MET expression and 16% (5/32) were MET gene amplified. Between the PDGCX models and their parental tumors, a high degree of similarity was observed for FGFR2 and MET gene amplification, and also for ERBB2 status (agreement rate = 94~100%; kappa value = 0.81~1). Protein expression of PTEN and MET also showed moderate agreement (agreement rate = 78%; kappa value = 0.46~0.56), while ERBB1 and ERBB3 expression showed slight agreement (agreement rate = 59~75%; kappa value = 0.18~0.19).

An alternative or complement might be to target the extracellular domain of HER2 with therapy-effective radionuclides. The fraction of patients with HER2 expression in primary tumors and major metastatic sites, e.g., lymph nodes and liver, was analyzed to evaluate the potential for such therapy. Samples from primary tumors and lymph node and liver metastases were taken from each patient within a few hours, and to our knowledge, such sampling is unique. The number of analyzed cases was therefore limited, since patients that had received preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or HER2-targeted therapy were excluded. From a large number of considered patients, only 29 could be included for HER2 analysis. Intracellular mutations were not analyzed since they are assumed to have no or minor effect on the extracellular binding of molecules that deliver radionuclides.

Recurrence is a major factor leading to treatment failure and low level of 5-year survival rate in GC patients following surgical resection. Therefore, identification of biomarkers with potential in predicting recurrence risk is the key problem of the prognosis in GC patients.;A total of 74 GC patients were selected for systematic analysis, consisting of 31 patients with recurrence and 43 patients without recurrence. Firstly, miRNAs microarray and bioinformatics methods were used to characterize differential expressed miRNAs from primary tumor samples. Following, we used a ROC method to select signature with best sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we validated the signature in GC samples (frozen fresh and blood samples) using quantitative PCR.;We have identified 12 differential miRNAs including 7 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated miRNAs in recurrence group. Using ROC method, we further ascertained hsa-miR-335 as a signature to recognize recurrence and non-recurrence cases in the training samples. Moreover, we validated this signature using quantitative PCR method in 64 test samples with consistent result with training set. A high frequency recurrence and poor survival were observed in GC cases with high level of hsa-miR-335 (P<0.001). In addition, we evaluated that hsa-miR-335 were involved in regulating target genes in several oncogenic signal-pathways, such as p53, MAPK, TGF-β, Wnt, ERbB, mTOR, Toll-like receptor and focal adhesion.;Our results indicate that the hsa-miR-335 has the potential to recognize the recurrence risk and relate to the prognosis of GC patients.",

In addition the effects of food on PK was tested.;A modified Fibonacci 3 plus 3 dose-escalation design was employed to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in patients with advanced solid tumors. The following dose levels were investigated: once daily (QD) at two dose levels (400-and 800 mg), twice daily (BID) in five dose levels (600-, 800-, 1000-, 1200- and 1500 mg), and three times daily (TID) in three dose levels (800-, 1000- and 1200 mg). In the PK and extension study, at least eight patients per dose cohort in three dose levels (maximum tolerated dose [MTD], one or two doses level lower than the MTD) were enrolled to evaluate the PK profiles.;Seventy-one patients were enrolled, with breast (n = 22) and lung cancers (n = 14) being the most common primary cancers. The most frequent drug-related adverse events were grade 1 to 3 diarrhea and rash, grade 1 to 2 fatigue. During dose escalation, the key DLT was grade 3 diarrhea observed in 5 patients at 1000 mg BID (n = 1), 1500 mg BID (n = 1), 800 mg TID (n = 1) and 1200 mg TID (n = 2). AST1306 was rapidly absorbed and had moderate to high clearance. PK concentration parameters increased with dose over the range evaluated, with no evidence of accumulation over time. Under fed conditions, the mean T(max) was prolonged, C(max) was increased, and AUC(0-∞) was raised. Of the 55 evaluable patients, 7 patients experienced partial responses, including 5 with breast cancer, 1 with lung cancer, and 1 with gastric cancer.

There is currently no guideline indicating the number of biopsy specimens and the location from which they should be obtained to reliably determine the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in GC. The aim of this pilot study was (a) to quantify HER2-positive tumor cells in different tumor regions to assess the spatial heterogeneity of HER2 expression and (b) to establish the required number of biopsy specimens and the location from which they should be obtained within the tumor to achieve concordance between HER2 expression status in the biopsy specimens and the resection specimen.;HER2 expression was quantified in six different regions of 24 HER2-positive GC and in six virtual biopsy specimens from different luminal regions. Intratumoral regional heterogeneity and concordance between HER2 status in the biopsy specimens and the resection specimen were analyzed.;HER2-positive cells were more frequent in the luminal tumor surface compared with deeper layers (p < 0.001). GCs with differentiated histological features were more commonly HER2 positive (p < 0.001). Assessment of HER2 expression status in five biopsy specimens was sufficient to achieve 100 % concordance between the biopsy specimens and the resection specimen.;This is the first study to suggest preferential HER2 positivity at the luminal surface in GC and to establish a minimum number of biopsy specimens needed to obtain a biopsy HER2 result which is identical to that from the whole tumor.

The patients' age, sex, tumor location, depth of invasion, pathological type, lymph node metastasis, and pathological stage were determined by a review of the medical records. Expression of HER2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the HercepTest(TM) kit. Standard criteria for HER2 positivity (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+) were used. Tumors that scored 3+ were considered HER2-positive. Expression of phospho Akt (pAkt) was also analyzed by IHC. Tumors were considered pAkt-positive when the percentage of positive tumor cells was 10% or more. PI3K, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA) mutations in exons 1, 9 and 20 were analyzed by pyrosequencing. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was analyzed by in situ hybridization targeting EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) with an EBER-RNA probe. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using the mononucleotide markers BAT25 and BAT26.;HER2 expression levels of 0, 1+, 2+ and 3+ were found in 167 (72%), 32 (14%), 12 (5%) and 20 (8.7%) samples, respectively. HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+) significantly correlated with intestinal histological type (15/20 vs 98 /205, P = 0.05). PIK3CA mutations were present in 20 cases (8.7%) and significantly correlated with MSI (10/20 vs 9/211, P < 0.01). The mutation frequency was high (21%) in T4 cancers and very low (6%) in T2 cancers. Mutations in exons 1, 9 and 20 were detected in 5 (2%), 9 (4%) and 7 (3%) cases, respectively. Two new types of PIK3CA mutation, R88Q and R108H, were found in exon1. All PIK3CA mutations were heterozygous missense single-base substitutions, the most common being H1047R (6/20, 30%) in exon20. Eighteen cancers (8%) were EBV-positive and this positivity significantly correlated with a diffuse histological type (13/18 vs 93/198, P = 0.04). There were 7 cases of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas (LELC) and 6 of those cases were EBV-positive (percent/EBV: 6/18, 33%; percent/all LELC: 6/7, 86%). pAkt expression was positive in 119 (53%) cases but showed no correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. pAkt expression was significantly correlated with HER2 overexpression (16/20 vs 103/211, P < 0.01) but not with PIK3CA mutations (12/20 vs 107/211, P = 0.37) or EBV infection (8/18 vs 103/211, P = 0.69). The frequency of pAkt expression was higher in cancers with exon20 mutations (100%) than in those with exon1 (40%) or exon9 (56%) mutations. One case showed both HER2 overexpression and EBV infection and 3 cases showed both PIK3CA mutations and EBV infection. However, no cases showed both PIK3CA mutations and HER2 overexpression. One EBV-positive cancer with PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) was MSI-positive. Three of these 4 cases were positive for pAkt expression. In survival analysis, pAkt expression significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (hazard ratio 1.75; 95%CI: 1.12-2.80, P = 0.02).;HER2 expression, PIK3CA mutations and EBV infection in gastric cancer were characterized. pAkt expression significantly correlates with HER2 expression and with a poor prognosis.",

We selected from a DNA library an aptamer specifically recognizing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB-2/HER2), a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, including breast and gastric tumors. Treatment of human gastric cancer cells with a trimeric version (42 nucleotides) of the selected aptamer (14 nucleotides) resulted in reduced cell growth in vitro, but a monomeric version was ineffective. Likewise, when treated with the trimeric aptamer, animals bearing tumor xenografts of human gastric origin reflected reduced rates of tumor growth. The antitumor effect of the aptamer was nearly twofold stronger than that of a monoclonal anti-ErbB-2/HER2 antibody. Consistent with aptamer-induced intracellular degradation of ErbB-2/HER2, incubation of gastric cancer cells with the trimeric aptamer promoted translocation of ErbB-2/HER2 from the cell surface to cytoplasmic puncta. This translocation was associated with a lysosomal hydrolase-dependent clearance of the ErbB-2/HER2 protein from cell extracts. We conclude that targeting ErbB-2/HER2 with DNA aptamers might retard the tumorigenic growth of gastric cancer by means of accelerating lysosomal degradation of the oncoprotein. This work exemplifies the potential pharmacological utility of aptamers directed at cell surface proteins, and it highlights an endocytosis-mediated mechanism of tumor inhibition.",

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to be a potent epithelial mitogen and oncoprotein when sustained over expression occurs. Our aim was to compare gastric mucosal levels of EGF and its receptor (EGFR) among controls, H. pylori infected subjects, and subjects following H. pylori eradication using quantitative flow cytometric analysis.;Patients referred for evaluation of dyspepsia underwent EGD and six antral biopsies were performed (two each for rapid urease testing (RUT), histopathology, and flow cytometry). Controls were those found to be H. pylori negative while subjects had confirmed infection. The study patients were treated, then had repeat EGD with biopsies.;There were 17 controls and 28 cases. Mean EGF and EGFR values were 2.69 and 2.46 for controls and 4.67 and 4.64 for subjects. Subjects' mean EGF was 73% higher (p = .035) and EGFR was 88% higher (p = 0.029) than controls. After treatment, the subjects' mean values declined 55% (p = 0.0001) for EGF and 40% (p = 0.002) for EGFR. Three subjects had persistent infection and showed no change in their EGF/EGFR levels. No difference was found among factor levels with respect to endoscopic findings.;Both EGF and EGFR from gastric antral biopsies are increased nearly 2-fold in infection with H. pylori. Infection eradication reduces levels of both factors to those of controls. One major pathogenic mechanism for gastric mucosal hyperproliferation and possibly carcinogenesis related to H. pylori may be the over expression of EGF and increased receptor density of EGFR on gastric mucosal cells.",

The data on the patients' age, sex, the anatomical location of the tumor and the Lauren's histological classification were collected from clinical and pathological records. The immunohistochemical (IHC) results were examined by two pathologists and the cases were classified as positive (3+), equivocal (2+) and negative (0 or 1+), according to the criteria of the IHC scoring system of gastric cancer. TMAs and whole-tissue sections were evaluated separately and independently. All cases yielding discordant IHC results and/or scored as 2+ were subjected to dual-color in situ hybridization in order to determine the final HER2 status. Besides determining the sensitivity and predictive value for HER2-positive status, we measured the accuracy of each antibody by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The agreement between the results obtained using the TMAs and those obtained using the whole-tissue sections was assessed by means of Kappa coefficient.;Intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 expression was observed with all antibodies. HER2-positive expression (3+) in the whole-tissue sections was observed in 23 cases (11.6%) using the 4B5 antibody, in 18 cases (9.1%) using the SP3 antibody and in 10 cases (5.1%) using the HercepTest antibody. In the TMAs, 11 positive cases (5.6%) were identified using SP3 antibody, 9 (4.6%) using the 4B5 antibody and 6 (3%) using the HercepTest antibody. The sensitivity using whole-tissue sections and TMA, respectively, was 95.2% and 42.9% with 4B5, 90.5% and 66.7% with SP3 and 47.6% and 42.9% with HercepTest. The accuracy, calculated from the area under the ROC curve, using whole-tissue sections and TMA, respectively, was 0.91 and 0.79 by 4B5, 0.86 and 0.80 by SP3 and 0.73 and 0.71 by HercepTest. The concordance of the results obtained using whole-tissue sections and TMA was 97.4% (Kappa 0.75) using HercepTest, 85.6% (Kappa 0.56) using SP3 and 84.1% (Kappa 0.38) using 4B5.;The use of the 4B5 antibody on whole-tissue sections was the most accurate IHC method for evaluating HER2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma.",

In this review, we provide an overview of recent developments in HER2 testing and results of clinical trials targeting HER2 in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Based on the encouraging ToGA trial findings it is now expected that routine HER2 testing will be included in the diagnostic work-up of patients with advanced gastric cancer. With regard to this testing, overexpression of the HER2 protein seems to possess the best predictive properties. However, HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is subject to assay and interobserver variability, so standardization and internal and external proficiency testing is an absolute prerequisite, especially as the IHC scoring system in gastric cancer is different from that of breast cancer. Further study is needed to investigate the clinical meaning of the significant heterogeneity observed in both gene amplification and protein overexpression in gastroesophageal cancer.

However, using biologic agents to target key molecular pathways, such as those regulated by human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family members, may be effective. Indeed, the positive results achieved by the anti-HER2 agent trastuzumab in a phase III trial in HER2-positive patients support this approach. Many new anti-HER molecules are now under evaluation for the treatment of gastric and gastro-esophageal junction cancer, but so far attempts to identify reliable predictive factors from phase I and II trials have produced inconclusive results.

CagA is injected into host cells via a Type IV secretion system where it activates growth factor-like signaling, disrupts cell-cell junctions, and perturbs host cell polarity. Using a transgenic Drosophila model, we have shown that CagA expression disrupts the morphogenesis of epithelial tissues such as the adult eye. Here we describe a genetic screen to identify modifiers of CagA-induced eye defects. We determined that reducing the copy number of genes encoding components of signaling pathways known to be targeted by CagA, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), modified the CagA-induced eye phenotypes. In our screen of just over half the Drosophila genome, we discovered 12 genes that either suppressed or enhanced CagA's disruption of the eye epithelium. Included in this list are genes involved in epithelial integrity, intracellular trafficking, and signal transduction. We investigated the mechanism of one suppressor, encoding the epithelial polarity determinant and junction protein Coracle, which is homologous to the mammalian Protein 4.1. We found that loss of a single copy of coracle improved the organization and integrity of larval retinal epithelia expressing CagA, but did not alter CagA's localization to cell junctions. Loss of a single copy of the coracle antagonist crumbs enhanced CagA-associated disruption of the larval retinal epithelium, whereas overexpression of crumbs suppressed this phenotype. Collectively, these results point to new cellular pathways whose disruption by CagA are likely to contribute to H. pylori-associated disease pathology.",

The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands (EGF family) are known to play a significant role in gastrointestinal cancer. In particular, the EGF receptor, HER1, is one of the main candidates for the molecular-targeted therapy of colon cancer, and HER2 is a candidate for the treatment of gastric cancer which overexpresses HER2. In contrast, the role of the HER and EGF families in malignant lymphoma has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of the HER and EGF families in lymphoma cell lines and tumor samples. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the ligands for HER1 were mainly expressed in gastric cancer and colon cancer cell lines, but not in lymphoma cell lines. On the other hand, the EGF family member, neuregulin (NRG) 4, was highly expressed in lymphoma cell lines. Immunohistochemical analyses of malignant lymphoma clinical samples revealed that NRG4 and HER4 were mainly expressed in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and follicular lymphoma. Immunoprecipitation of Raji and Daudi cell lines revealed that recombinant NRG4 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER4. Additionally, recombinant NRG4 activated the proliferation of lymphoma cell lines.

Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy improved the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin has become a new standard for first-line treatment of advanced biliary cancer. Octreotide LAR significantly lengthened median time to tumor progression compared with placebo in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of the midgut. Addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidines for preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage II or III rectal cancer did not improve local tumor response but increased toxicities. Bevacizumab did not provide additional benefit to chemotherapy in adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II or III colon cancer. In patients with resected stage II colon cancer, recurrence score estimated by multigene RT-PCR assay has been shown to provide additional risk stratification. In stage IV colorectal cancer, data have supported the routine use of prophylactic skin treatment in patients receiving antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor, and the use of upfront chemotherapy as initial management in patients with synchronous metastasis without obstruction or bleeding from the primary site.",

This paper was designed to investigate the effect of CHAG on metastasis and growth of tumor cells. Migration and invasion assays, Western blotting, pull down assay, siRNA interference, and nude mice implantation tumor model were applied in this study. The results of in vitro experiments with gastric cancer cell line AGS and hepatic cancer cell line HepG2 showed that CHAG inhibited the migration and invasion activities, the MAPK and PI3K/Akt mediated signaling, the activation of small G proteins Rac1 and RhoA, and the expression of MMPs and PCNA initiated by EGF, through blocking the activation of EGFR. CHAG also had inhibitory effect on activation of other membrane receptors, including integrin and VEGFR. When the expression of hyaluronic acid receptors (CD44 or RHAMM) was interfered, the above inhibitory effects of CHAG still existed. In vivo experimental results showed that CHAG suppressed colonization, growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 in peritoneal cavity of nude mice. In conclusion, CHAG had inhibitory effect on tumor cells, through covering cell surface and blocking the interaction between extracellular stimulative factors and their receptors.",

The incidence of oesophageal and oesophagogastric junctional tumours is increasing, making these important disease entities to understand and research. Despite improvements in surgical and peri-operative supportive care, 3-year overall survival with surgery alone for resectable disease is still poor. Outcomes in localised oesophageal cancer are improved with pre-operative chemotherapy, and in gastric cancer with peri-operative treatment or post-operative chemoradiotherapy. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma can be treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy as an alternative to surgery. While survival in patients presenting with metastatic disease is improved with the addition of systemic chemotherapy, median survival remains <1 year. Patients who are otherwise fit can be offered chemotherapy and this is superior to best supportive care. Regimens including a platinum and an anthracycline agent are favoured by the results of randomised trials. No standard second-line therapy has emerged. New research into taxanes has shown promising anti-cancer activity, and novel areas of investigation include incorporation of agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor or epidermal growth factor receptor into standard regimens.

        "Doc_abstract":"Concerns have been raised regarding a possible link between the increasing utilization of RAAS blocking strategies in the United States and the increasing ESRD epidemic. Most reports of accelerated renal failure in CKD patients with renal artery stenosis on RAAS blockade are retrospective. We hypothesized that this syndrome is therefore poorly understood, may be under-recognized, and demanded prospective analysis. As part of a larger cohort of 100 CKD patients on RAAS blockade presenting with worsening renal failure (>25% increased serum creatinine from baseline) while concurrently on an ACE inhibitor and/or an angiotensin receptor blocker, 26 patients (26%) enrolled between September 2002 and February 2005 had hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. RAAS blockade was discontinued, standard nephrology care applied, and eGFR by MDRD monitored. They consisted of 26 Caucasian patients, M:F = 10:16, age 75.3 +/- 6.4 (63-87) years. Mean follow-up was 26.4 +/- 16.4 (1-49) months. Duration of RAAS blockade prior to enrollment was 20.2 +/- 16.4 (0.5-48) months. Contrary to previous reports, precipitating factors were often absent (15/26), unilateral RAS lesions in patients with dual kidneys was common (19/26), and progression to ESRD was frequent (5/26). Four-fifths of the ESRD patients were dead after 5.5 +/- 4.1 (1-11) months. A fifth patient with improved eGFR died after 14 months from metastatic gastric cancer. Excluding five patients who progressed to ESRD and two patients lost early to follow-up, in 19 patients, eGFR increased from 27.8 +/- 9.5 (11-47) to 36.7 +/- 16 (14-68) mL/min/1.73 m(2) BSA (p = 0.014) after 34.8 +/- 10.1 (14-49) months of follow-up. This improvement in eGFR was evident after weeks to months of stopping RAAS blockade in these patients with and without renal PTA and stenting. Nevertheless, renal PTA/stenting further improved eGFR in selected patients. We conclude that renal failure/ESRD associated with concurrent RAAS blockade in older CKD patients with renal stenosis remains poorly understood and mostly unrecognized. Unilateral lesions in patients with dual kidneys, absent precipitating factors, and progression to ESRD with high mortality, despite discontinuation of RAAS blockade, are more common than previously thought. Lower baseline eGFR (<35) predicted ESRD. Our findings call for a larger prospective study, especially given growing concerns of iatrogenic renal failure from RAAS blockade in the aging U.S. population. An aging U.S. population further raises the probability of the presence of increasing and unrecognized renal artery stenosis in our CKD patient population.",

To select patients for treatment, HER2 status is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization. Gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas demonstrate heterogeneity in HER2 expression. Nonetheless, testing is often performed on biopsies alone, which raises the issue of nonrepresentative sampling. We investigated the correlation of HER2 status between matched biopsy and resection specimens and the role of tumor heterogeneity in contributing to discrepancy. A total of 128 patients with gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma had tissue available from a biopsy and subsequent resection. HER2 IHC was performed and evaluated by the criteria used in the Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer clinical trial. In situ hybridization was performed if IHC was equivocal (2+) in either the biopsy or resection and in discrepant cases. Tumor heterogeneity was defined as 3+ or 2+ staining in 10% to 60% of tumor cells. Overall, HER2 was overexpressed in 18 tumors (14%), with a biopsy-resection concordance of 96.1%. Five cases were discrepant; 2 were positive on biopsy only, and 3 were positive on resection only. Tumor heterogeneity was seen in 80% of discrepant biopsies and resections, compared with 24% of concordant cases (P = .016). Our study demonstrates strong concordance between biopsy and resection specimens for HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer. Discordance was correlated with tumor heterogeneity. Overall, both biopsy and resection specimens are appropriate for HER2 testing, but generous sampling for biopsy specimens is necessary to ensure accurate assessment. ",

A panel of gastric and esophageal cancer cell lines was treated with wortmannin as an Akt-signal inhibitor; the MAPK signal inhibitor PD98059; lapatinib, which inhibits both the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 tyrosine kinase; or siRNA for MAPK. The levels of HER2-signaling molecules, APM components, and HLA class I were evaluated by Western blot, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry. Resected gastric tumor tissues (n = 102) were analyzed for p-Erk and HLA class I expression by immunohistochemistry. As a result, inhibition of the MAPK pathway induced upregulation of HLA-A02 and HLA-A24 expression in parallel with an increase in APM components and enhanced target sensitivity to tumor Ag-specific CTL lysis. HLA-A expression was predominantly regulated by the MAPK pathway, but it was also influenced, in part, by the Akt pathway.

So far, the development of targeted therapies stays somewhat behind their integration into treatment concepts compared to other gastrointestinal diseases. Thus, the review summarizes the recent advances in the development of targeted therapies in advanced esophagogastric cancer. The majority of agents tested were angiogenesis inhibitors or agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR1 and HER2. For trastuzumab and bevacizumab, phase III trial results have been presented recently. While addition of trastuzumab to cisplatin/5-fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy results in a clinically relevant and statistically significant survival benefit in HER 2+ patients, the benefit of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy was not significant. Thus, all patients with metastatic disease should be tested for HER-2 status in the tumor. Trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin/5-fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is the new standard of care for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.",

As a result, HER2 testing is now recommended for all patients with advanced or metastatic disease, although there is still some debate as to the optimal methods of assessment. HER2 expression in gastric and GEJ tumors shows several differences compared with breast tumors and, for this reason, the proposed criteria for scoring HER2 expression in biopsies and resections of gastric and GEJ carcinomas differ from those used in breast carcinomas.

Perioperative combination chemotherapy based on cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) improves the prognosis of patients with stage II and stage III disease. Preoperative initiation of chemotherapy seems to be essential for achieving this result, according to studies performed in the West. On the other hand, Japanese investigators demonstrated that postoperative administration of oral fluoropyrimidine prodrugs can substantially improve the prognosis of patients with curatively resected gastric cancer. The addition of docetaxel to cisplatin and 5-FU has significantly improved response rate, time to progression, and overall survival in patients treated for advanced gastric cancer, as well as prolonging time to definitive worsening of global health status and Karnofsky performance status. Due to increased hematologic toxicity with this regimen, particularly neutropenic infections, careful patient selection and optimal supportive care, including prophylactic granulocyte colonystimulating factor, are required. Alternative schedules are being investigated that could improve the tolerability of docetaxel plus platinum/fluoropyrimidine combination regimens. Further improvements in outcome may be achieved when even more active chemotherapy combinations including docetaxel are systematically implemented into the preoperative treatment of locally advanced gastroesophageal cancers. Initial results with biologic targeted agents in this setting are promising. Pathways currently under investigation include the epidermal growth factor receptors Her-1 and Her-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule EpCAM. It is hoped that targeting these pathways will further increase the efficacy of biochemotherapy of gastroesophageal cancer. Evaluating early response to biochemotherapy using metabolic imaging is a novel approach that may allow for tailoring systemic therapy to individual tumor biology. A deeper understanding of the relevant pathognomonic molecular patterns and signatures in individual tumors may facilitate faster drug development and permit more accurate selection of active therapies in the future.",

The HER2 targeting antibody trastuzumab treatment requires accurate measurement of HER2 levels for proper diagnosis. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) with highly direct, precise and absolute nucleic acid quantification could be used to detect HER2 amplification levels.;Our objective was to evaluate a robust, accurate and less subjective application of ddPCR for HER2 amplification levels and test the assay performance in clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast and gastric carcinoma samples.;Genomic DNA from HER2 amplified cell line SK-BR-3 was used to set up the ddPCR assays. The copy number of HER2 was compared to the chromosome 17 centromere reference gene (CEP17), expressed as HER2:CEP17 ratio. Genomic DNAs of FFPE specimens from 145 Asian patients with breast and gastric carcinomas were assayed using both standard methods, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and ddPCR.;Based on 145 clinical breast and gastric carcinoma cases, our study demonstrated a high concordance of ddPCR results to FISH and IHC. In breast cancer specimens, the ddPCR results had high concordance with FISH and IHC defined HER2 status with a sensitivity of 90.9% (30/33) and a specificity of 100% (77/77). In gastric cancer specimens that were concordant in both FISH and IHC, our assay was 95.5% concordant with FISH and IHC (21/22).;ddPCR has the advantage of automation and also allows levels of HER2 amplification to be easily evaluated in large numbers of samples, and presents a potential option to define HER2 status.",

The peptide hormone, gastrin, stimulates acid secretion but also induces proliferation of the acid-secreting mucosa. Because the relationship between these peptides of overlapping function is not understood, we chose to investigate the regulatory effect of gastrin on TFF2 expression. The expression of mRNA and protein of TFF2 was determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. A series of truncated and mutant murine TFF2 promoter constructs was generated. Promoter activity was assessed using dual luciferase reporter assays. Gastrin-responsive DNA-binding sites in the TFF2 promoter were evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Gastrin significantly increased the level of endogenous mRNA of TFF2 in the gastrin receptor-expressing AGS-E gastric cancer cell line in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TFF2 protein expression in the gastric fundus was elevated in hypergastrinemic (INS-GAS) transgenic mice and reduced in gastrin-deficient mice. Gastrin treatment increased TFF2 promoter activity through cis-acting regions, containing CCAATA- and GC-rich enhancers. Pretreatment with Y-F476, a gastrin/CCK(B) receptor antagonist, abolished gastrin-dependent promoter activity. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK1), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) reduced gastrin-dependent TFF2 promoter activity, whereas an epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor had no effect. We found that gastrin regulates TFF2 transcription through a GC-rich DNA-binding site and a PKC-, MEK1- and PI 3-kinase-dependent but EGFR-independent pathway.

High-throughput mutation profile has shown that lung cancer frequently harbors comutation of cancer-related genes. Therefore, given that cancer cells have multiple genetic alterations, combinatorial therapeutic strategy is demanded for effective cancer therapy. To address this, we first characterized MEK dependence in four NSCLC cells. Two cells (H358, A549) carried KRAS mutation only, and the other two (H23, H157) harbored comutation of KRAS/PTEN. H358 cells with KRAS mutation only were sensitive to MEK inhibition. However, the other KRAS mutant A549 cells were resistant to MEK inhibition. Previously, we have shown that dual inhibition of EGFR and MEK signaling shows a synergistic effect on KRAS mutant gastric cancer cells by suppressing compensatory activation of AKT. Here we also observed that this combination was effective in KRAS mutant A549 cells. However, the combination was ineffective in H23 and 157 cells with comutation of KRAS/PTEN. Compared to KRAS mutant/PTEN wild-type cells, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was significantly activated following MEK inhibition in KRAS/PTEN comutant cells. Combined STAT3 inhibition by a JAK2 inhibitor or gene knockdown with MEK inhibition blocked STAT3 activation, synergistically suppressed cell growth, and induced apoptosis in comutant cells. Taken together, our study provides molecular insights that help explain the heterogeneous response to MEK inhibition in KRAS mutant lung cancers, and presents a rationale for the clinical investigation of combination of MEK and EGFR inhibitor or MEK and JAK2 inhibitor depending on PTEN status.",

Apoptosis occurs via extrinsic or intrinsic signaling each triggered and regulated by many different molecular pathways. In recent years, the selective induction of apoptosis in tumor cells has been increasingly recognized as a promising approach for cancer therapy. A detailed understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis is essential for developing novel effective therapeutic approaches. Apoptosis can be induced by many different approaches including activating cell surface death receptors (for example, Fas, TRAIL and TNF receptors), inhibiting cell survival signaling (such as EGFR, MAPK and PI3K), altering apoptosis threshold by modulating pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, down-regulating anti-apoptosis proteins (such as XIAP, survivin and c-IAP2), and using other pro-apoptotic agents.

At a concentration of 0.1 μM, Pb(2+) induced IL-8 gene activation in gastric carcinoma AGS cells. Using a IL-8 promoter-deletion analysis, transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) was identified as a necessary component of Pb(2+) -induced IL-8 gene activation. Upregulation of the IL-8 gene was abrogated by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, and partially suppressed by the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, AG1478 and PD153035. Furthermore, c-Jun protein expression was induced in cells treated with Pb(2+) , and overexpression of c-Jun enhanced Pb(2+) -induced IL-8 activation.

A total of 212 patients were screened for HER2 expression.;Immunohistochemical (IHC) HER2 expression was: 83 (40%) grade 0, 71 (34%) grade 1, 31 (15%) grade 2, 22 (11%) grade 3. A total of 17 patients with IHC +3 HER2 expression or gene amplification could be assessed for the treatment response. Grade 3/4 treatment toxicities were: each 7% leucopenia, diarrhoea, nausea and hand-foot syndrome. Progression-free survival after 12 weeks was 23.5%, median overall survival (OS) 6.9 months.;This study demonstrates +3 HER2 expression or gene amplification in 11% of patients. Contrary to breast and gastric cancer, only 7 out of 11 (64%) patients with IHC +3 HER2 expression showed gene amplification. Although the therapy was well tolerated, PFS and OS did not perform favourably compared with standard chemotherapy.

Since the approval of trastuzumab, targeted therapies are emerging as promising treatment options for the disease. This study aimed to explore the molecular segmentation of several known therapeutics targets, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), MET and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), within GC using clinically approved or investigational kits and scoring criteria. Knowledge of how these markers are segmented in the same cohort of GC patients could improve future clinical trial designs.;Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH methods, overexpression and amplification of HER2, FGFR2 and MET were profiled in a cohort of Chinese GC samples. The correlations between anti-tumour sensitivity and the molecular segments of HER2, MET and FGFR2 alterations were further tested in a panel of GC cell lines and the patient-derived GC xenograft (PDGCX) model using the targeted inhibitors.;Of 172 GC patients, positivity for HER2, MET and FGFR2 alternations was found in 23 (13.4%), 21 (12.2%) and 9 (5.2%) patients, respectively. Positivity for MET was found in 3 of 23 HER2-positive GC patients. Co-positivity for FGFR2 and MET was found in 1 GC patient, and amplification of the two genes was found in different tumour cells. Our study in a panel of GC cell lines showed that in most cell lines, amplification or high expression of a particular molecular marker was mutually exclusive and in vitro sensitivity to the targeted agents lapatinib, PD173074 and crizotinib was only observed in cell lines with the corresponding high expression of the drugs' target protein. SGC031, an MET-positive PDGCX mouse model, responded to crizotinib but not to lapatinib or PD173074.;Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, MET and FGFR2 oncogenic driver alterations (gene amplification and overexpression) occur in three largely distinct molecular segments in GC.

We identified the novel Hsp90 inhibitor, CH5164840, and investigated its induction of oncogenic client protein degradation, antiproliferative activity, and apoptosis against an NCI-N87 gastric cancer cell line and a BT-474 breast cancer cell line. Interestingly, CH5164840 demonstrated tumor selectivity both in vitro and in vivo, binding to tumor Hsp90 (which forms active multiple chaperone complexes) in vitro, and being distributed effectively to tumors in a mouse model, which, taken together, supports the decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt by CH5164840 that we observed in tumor tissues, but not in normal tissues. As well as being well tolerated, the oral administration of CH5164840 exhibited potent antitumor efficacy with regression in NCI-N87 and BT-474 tumor xenograft models. In addition, CH5164840 significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy against gastric and breast cancer models when combined with the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted agents, trastuzumab and lapatinib. These data demonstrate the potent antitumor efficacy of CH5164840 when administered alone, and its significant combination efficacy when combined with trastuzumab or lapatinib, supporting the clinical development of CH5164840 as an Hsp90 inhibitor for combination therapy with HER2-targeted agents against HER2-overexpressing tumors.",

However, 8 (21%) of the normal gastric mucosa samples showed moderate levels of staining with the AR antibody. Within the carcinomas, there was a slight trend for association between TGFalpha and CR-1 expression (p<0.05), but no correlation was found between epidermal growth factor receptor and CR-1 expression. Staining for p53 was observed in 26 (70%) of the carcinomas, 3 (10%) intestinal metaplasias and none of the gastric mucosa samples.

The effects of 8-Cl-cAMP on human gastric carcinoma cell lines were studied. Twenty microM 8-Cl-cAMP clearly inhibited cell growth in six cell lines (TMK-1, KATO-III, MKN-7, -28, -45, and -74) but not in MKN-1. Cell population in the G1 phase was increased in KATO III cells, which were more responsive to 8-Cl-cAMP, while cell cycle progression in TMK-1 and MKN-1 cells was apparently not influenced by 8-Cl-cAMP. The various changes induced by 8-Cl-cAMP were further analyzed in TMK-1 cells. Decrease of type I regulatory subunit (RI) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and translocation of RII from cytosol to nucleus were induced by 8-Cl-cAMP treatment. 8-Cl-cAMP increased the level of cAMP-response element (CRE) binding protein in addition to inducing FOS mRNA, whose promoter contains CRE. 8-Cl-cAMP decreased the expression of mRNA for transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), while the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor was not changed. Expression of HRAS and MYC mRNAs was slightly increased, whereas the amounts of HRAS and MYC proteins remained unchanged. Our results overall suggest that 8-Cl-cAMP might be a useful tool for antitumor therapy of gastric cancers and that cell growth inhibition by 8-Cl-cAMP might account for the decrease of TGF-alpha expression by tumor cells.",

Under physiologic levels of expression, HER2 heterodimerizes with other members of the EGF receptor/HER/ErbB family, and the HER2-HER3 dimer forms one of the most potent oncogenic receptor pairs. Previous structural biology studies have individually crystallized the kinase domains of HER2 and HER3, but the HER2-HER3 kinase domain heterodimer structure has yet to be solved. Using a reconstituted membrane system to form HER2-HER3 kinase domain heterodimers and carboxyl group footprinting mass spectrometry, we observed that HER2 and HER3 kinase domains preferentially form asymmetric heterodimers with HER3 and HER2 monomers occupying the donor and acceptor kinase positions, respectively. Conformational changes in the HER2 activation loop, as measured by changes in carboxyl group labeling, required both dimerization and nucleotide binding but did not require activation loop phosphorylation at Tyr-877. Molecular dynamics simulations on HER2-HER3 kinase dimers identify specific inter- and intramolecular interactions and were in good agreement with MS measurements. Specifically, several intermolecular ionic interactions between HER2 Lys-716-HER3 Glu-909, HER2 Glu-717-HER3 Lys-907, and HER2 Asp-871-HER3 Arg-948 were identified by molecular dynamics. We also evaluated the effect of the cancer-associated mutations HER2 D769H/D769Y, HER3 E909G, and HER3 R948K (also numbered HER3 E928G and R967K) on kinase activity in the context of this new structural model.

In this single institution experience, 35 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were treated with irradiation and 200 mg doses of nimotuzumab. The first 6 doses were administered weekly, together with radiotherapy, and then treatment continued every 21 days until 1 year.

The most frequent treatment-related toxicities were increase in liver function tests, fever, nausea, anorexia, asthenia, dizziness, and tremors. These adverse reactions were classified as mild and moderate. The median survival time was 12.4 mo or 27.0 mo for patients with GBM or AA patients, respectively, who received curative-intent radiotherapy in combination with the antibody. The survival time of a matched population treated at the same hospital with irradiation alone was decreased (median 8.0 and 12.2 mo for GBM and AA patients, respectively) compared with that of the patients who received nimotuzumab and curative-intent radiotherapy.

In fact, only 9 of the 86 cases with a weak-to-moderate staining intensity, which showed a fragmented membrane signal, resulted in being amplified by FISH, whereas 19 of the 51 cases presenting an overall strong IHC reaction and some extent of continuous membrane signal were FISH amplified (P=0.002).;Combined intensity and linearity of membrane signal, although limited, resulted in the best aid (P=0.0002) in making the final score decision in borderline IHC Her2 tests similar to what is envisaged in the Her2 scoring system for gastric cancer.",

Additionally, gastrin markedly increased the S-phase cell population, whereas GKN1 significantly inhibited the effect of gastrin by regulating the expression of G1/S cell-cycle regulators. Furthermore, gastrin induced activation of the NF-kB and β-catenin signaling pathways and increased the expression of CCKBR, EGFR, and c-Met in AGS and MKN1 cells. However, GKN1 completely suppressed these effects of gastrin via downregulation of gastrin/CCKBR/growth factor receptor expression. Moreover, GKN1 reduced gastrin and CCKBR mRNA expression in AGS and MKN1 cells, and there was an inverse correlation between GKN1 and gastrin, as well as between GKN1 and CCKBR mRNA expression in noncancerous gastric mucosae.;These data suggest that GKN1 may contribute to the maintenance of gastric epithelial homeostasis and inhibit gastric carcinogenesis by downregulating the gastrin-CCKBR signaling pathway.",

To reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy on the bone marrow, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 were applied to patients suffering of gastrointestinal cancers. To determine the influence of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 on human pancreas and gastric cancer cell cells in vitro, a sensitive microculture test system was established that allows precise quantification of proliferation. A more than twofold enhancement of proliferation was observed by interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in two of two cell cultures derived from gastric carcinoma cells, while two of nine cultures from pancreas carcinoma cells have shown enhanced cell growth in the presence of recombinant human interleukin 3 or recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In comparison, recombinant human epidermal growth factor increased cell growth in two of two gastric and in five of nine pancreas carcinoma cultures. In general, 1-10 ng/mL of the growth factors yielded the highest growth rate, but even 1-pg amounts produced increased cell growth. Expression of messenger RNA for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, and the oncogene HER2/neu remained undetectable in all of the tested cell lines, while the various abundance of messenger RNA for the epidermal growth factor receptor was different in each cell line.

Expansion efficiency, NK receptor repertoire before and after expansion, expression of NK specific ligands, cytolytic activity against allogeneic and autologous tumor targets, with and without the addition of chimeric EGFR monoclonal antibody, were investigated.;Cell expansion shifted the NK cell receptor repertoire towards activation and resulted in cytotoxicity against various allogeneic tumor cell lines and autologous gastric cancer cells, while sparing normal PBMC.

Trastuzumab anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated within these PDECX models (n = 8 animals/group). Furthermore, hotspot mutations of EGFR, K-ras, B-raf and PIK3CA genes were screened for in the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues. Similarity between the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissue was confirmed by histology, morphology, HER-2 GCN and mutation.;None of the PDECX models (or their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues) harbored HER-2 gene amplification.

It is overexpressed in breast, esophageal, and gastric cancers, and may contribute to the invasive potential of cancer cells. Molecular interactions involving Grb7 therefore provide attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. We have utilized phage display random peptide libraries as a source of small peptide ligands to the SH2 domain of Grb7. Screening these libraries against purified Grb7 SH2 resulted in the identification of Grb7-binding peptide phage clones that contained a non-phosphorylated Tyr-X-Asn (YXN) motif. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of this motif is characteristic of Grb7 SH2 domain binding sites identified in RTKs and other signaling proteins such as Shc. Peptides that are non-phosphorylated have greater potential in the development of therapeutics because of the instability of a phosphate group in vivo. Using a biased library approach with this conserved YXN motif, we identified seven different peptide phage clones, which bind specifically to the SH2 domain of Grb7. These peptides did not bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (which also selects for Asn at pY(+2)) or Grb14, a closely related family member. The cyclic structure of the peptides was required to bind to the Grb7 SH2 domain. Importantly, the synthetic Grb7-binding peptide G7-18 in cell lysates was able to specifically inhibit the association of Grb7 with the ErbB family of RTKs, in particular ErbB3, in a dose-dependent manner. These peptides will be useful in the development of targeted molecular therapeutics for cancers overexpressing Grb7 and in the development of Grb7-specific inhibitors to gain a complete understanding of the physiological role of Grb7.",

An alternative labeling protocol based on the combination of immunogold and immunoenzymatic techniques was utilized to confirm the results derived from immunoenzymatic double staining.;In total, single CK18-positive tumor cells were detected in 180 (33.8%) of 532 bone marrow aspirates, with few differences among patients with breast or gastrointestinal cancer in TNM stage M0 (i.e., no distant metastasis). In patients with overt metastasis (stage M1), however, the incidence of metastatic cells in marrow increased to 73.7% in breast cancer, 52.5% in gastric cancer, and 39.0% in colon cancer. Whereas expression of Ki-67 or p120 on micrometastatic cells was observed only in 11 (15.9%) of 69 cancer patients analyzed, ErbB2+/CK18+ cells were found in 48 (67.6%) of 71 breast cancer patients and 14 (28.0%) of 50 patients with gastrointestinal cancer (P = .0001). The incidence of ErbB2+/CK18+ cells was positively correlated with the clinical stage of tumor progression.;The high incidence of ErbB2 expression on micrometastatic breast cancer cells in the bone marrow suggests that these cells might have been positively selected during early stages of metastasis. The majority of these cells appear to be in a dormant state of cell growth.;Although support from clinical follow-up is still needed, this study demonstrates that, beyond the mere presence of micrometastatic cells in bone marrow, useful prognostic information can be obtained by analysis of additional cell growth markers.",
