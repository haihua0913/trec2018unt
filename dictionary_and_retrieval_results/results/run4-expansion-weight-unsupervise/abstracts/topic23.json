        "Doc_abstract":"To evaluate the mutational profiles associated with BRAF mutations in human melanoma, we have studied BRAF, RAS, PTEN, TP53, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes and their expression in melanoma lesions. Owing to the lack of sufficient material from fresh specimens, we employed short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma biopsies. In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival. These data support the existence of several molecularly defined melanoma groups which likely reflect different clinical/biological behaviour, thus suggesting that a more extensive molecular classification of melanoma would significantly impact its clinical management.",

It has been suggested that the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT signaling with concurrent loss of function of the tumor suppressor molecule PTEN contributes to cancer formation. Members of the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway, including these proteins and mTOR, are altered in melanoma tumors and cell lines. A hallmark of activation of the pathway is the loss of function of PTEN. Indeed, loss of heterozygosity of PTEN has been observed in approximately 30% of human melanomas, implicating this signaling pathway in this cancer. PI3K signaling activation, via loss of PTEN function, can inhibit proapoptotic genes such as the FoxO family of transcription factors, while inducing cell growth- and cell survival-related elements such as p70S6K and AKT. Determining how the PI3K-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, alone or in cooperation with other pathways, orchestrates the induction of target genes involved in a diverse range of activities is a major challenge in research into melanoma initiation and progression. Moreover, the acquisition of basic knowledge will help patient management with appropriate therapies that are already, or will shortly be, on the market.",

One such target is the V600E \"gain-of-function\" BRAF mutation found in 60% of melanomas; other mutations or molecular alterations cooperate with V600E BRAF, particularly those that cause loss of function of PTEN, upstream of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin.

        "Doc_abstract":"Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in from chromosome ten (PTEN), initially also known as mutated in multiple advanced cancers or TGF-beta-regulated and epithelia cell-enriched phosphatase, is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in a large fraction of human melanomas. A broad variety of human cancers carry PTEN alterations, including glioblastomas, endometrial, breast, thyroid and prostate cancers. The PTEN protein has at least two biochemical functions: it has both lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity. The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN decreases intracellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) level and downstream Akt activity. Cell-cycle progression is arrested at G1/S, mediated at least partially through the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. In addition, agonist-induced apoptosis is mediated by PTEN, through the upregulation of proapoptotic machinery involving caspases and BID, and the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl2. The protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is apparently less central to its involvement in tumorigenesis. It is involved in the inhibition of focal adhesion formation, cell spreading and migration, as well as the inhibition of growth factor-stimulated MAPK signaling. Therefore, the combined effects of the loss of PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase activity may result in aberrant cell growth and escape from apoptosis, as well as abnormal cell spreading and migration. In melanoma, PTEN loss has been mostly observed as a late event, although a dose-dependent loss of PTEN protein and function has been implicated in early stages of tumorigenesis as well. In addition, loss of PTEN and oncogenic activation of RAS seem to occur in a reciprocal fashion, both of which could cooperate with CDKN2A loss in contribution to melanoma tumorigenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer cells acquire several traits that allow for their survival and progression, including the ability to evade the host immune response. However, the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade host immune responses remain largely elusive. Here we study the phenomena of immune evasion in malignant melanoma cells. We find that the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is an important regulator of the host immune response against melanoma cells. Mechanistically, PTEN represses the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines by blocking the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. In melanoma cells lacking PTEN, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activates the transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines in a PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, conditioned media from PTEN-deficient, patient-derived short-term melanoma cultures and established melanoma cell lines blocked the production of the interleukin-12 (IL-12) in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Inhibition of IL-12 production was rescued by restoring PTEN or using neutralizing antibodies against the immunosuppressive cytokines. Furthermore, we report that PTEN, as an alternative mechanism to promote the host immune response against cancer cells, represses the expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand, a known repressor of the host immune response. Finally, to establish the clinical significance of our results, we analyzed malignant melanoma patient samples with or without brisk host responses. These analyses confirmed that PTEN loss is associated with a higher percentage of malignant melanoma samples with non-brisk host responses compared with samples with brisk host responses. Collectively, these results establish that PTEN functions as a melanoma tumor suppressor in part by regulating the host immune response against melanoma cells and highlight the importance of assessing PTEN status before recruiting melanoma patients for immunotherapies.

In the present study, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to determine how BRAF inhibition remodeled the signaling network of melanoma cell lines that were BRAF mutant and PTEN null. Short-term BRAF inhibition was associated with marked changes in fibronectin-based adhesion signaling that were PTEN dependent. These effects were recapitulated through BRAF siRNA knockdown and following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Increased fibronectin expression was also observed in mouse xenograft models as well as specimens from melanoma patients undergoing BRAF inhibitor treatment. Analysis of a melanoma tissue microarray showed loss of PTEN expression to predict for a lower overall survival, with a trend for even lower survival being seen when loss of fibronectin was included in the analysis. Mechanistically, the induction of fibronectin limited the responses of these PTEN-null melanoma cell lines to vemurafenib, with enhanced cytotoxicity observed following the knockdown of either fibronectin or its receptor α5β1 integrin. This in turn abrogated the cytotoxic response to BRAF inhibition via increased AKT signaling, which prevented the induction of cell death by maintaining the expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1. The protection conveyed by the induction of FN expression could be overcome through combined treatment with a BRAF and PI3K inhibitor. ",

In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2.

It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-α and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways.

Both incidence and mortality rates continue to rise each year, with no effective long-term treatment on the horizon. In part, this reflects lack of identification of critical genes involved and specific therapies targeted to correct these defects. We report that selective activation of the Akt3 protein promotes cell survival and tumor development in 43 to 60% of nonfamilial melanomas. The predominant Akt isoform active in melanomas was identified by showing that small interfering RNA (siRNA) against only Akt3, and not Akt1 or Akt2, lowered the amount of phosphorylated (active) Akt in melanoma cells. The amount of active Akt3 increased progressively during melanoma tumor progression with highest levels present in advanced-stage metastatic melanomas. Mechanisms of Akt3 deregulation occurred through a combination of overexpression of Akt3 accompanying copy number increases of the gene and decreased PTEN protein function occurring through loss or haploinsufficiency of the PTEN gene. Targeted reduction of Akt3 activity with siRNA or by expressing active PTEN protein stimulated apoptotic signaling, which reduced cell survival by increasing apoptosis rates thereby inhibiting melanoma tumor development. Identifying Akt3 as a selective target in melanoma cells provides new therapeutic opportunities for patients in the advanced stages of this disease.",

Levels of ITK protein differed among melanoma cell lines and representative lines were transduced with four different lentiviral constructs that each contained an shRNA designed to knockdown ITK mRNA levels.

In melanoma cell lines, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of ITK decreased proliferation and migration and increased the percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phase. Treatment of melanoma-bearing mice with BI 10N reduced growth of ITK-expressing xenografts or established autochthonous (Tyr-Cre/Pten(null)/Braf(V600E)) melanomas.;We conclude that ITK, formerly considered an immune cell-specific protein, is aberrantly expressed in melanoma and promotes tumor development and progression.

To date, most studies which strongly implicate PTEN in the etiology of sporadic melanomas have depended on cell lines, short-term tumor cultures and noncultured metastatic melanomas. The only study which reports PTEN protein expression in melanoma focuses on cytoplasmic expression, mainly in metastatic samples. To determine how PTEN contributes to the etiology or the progression of primary cutaneous melanoma, we examined cytoplasmic and nuclear PTEN expression against clinical and pathologic features in a population-based sample of 150 individuals with incident primary cutaneous melanoma. Among 92 evaluable samples, 30 had no or decreased cytoplasmic PTEN protein expression and the remaining 62 had normal PTEN expression. In contrast, 84 tumors had no or decreased nuclear expression and 8 had normal nuclear PTEN expression. None of the clinical features studied, such as Clark's level and Breslow thickness or sun exposure, were associated with cytoplasmic PTEN expressional levels. An association with loss of nuclear PTEN expression was indicated for anatomical site (p = 0.06) and mitotic index (p = 0.02). There was also an association for melanomas to either not express nuclear PTEN or to express p53 alone, rather than both simultaneously (p = 0.02). In contrast with metastatic melanoma, where we have shown previously that almost two-thirds of tumors have some PTEN inactivation, only one-third of primary melanomas had PTEN silencing. This suggests that PTEN inactivation is a late event likely related to melanoma progression rather than initiation. Taken together with our previous observations in thyroid and islet cell tumors, our data suggest that nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of PTEN might also play a role in melanoma progression.",

Distinct copy number alterations were detected, including loss or gain of whole chromosomes but also minute amplifications and homozygous deletions. Most common overlapping regions with losses were mapped to 9p24.3-q13, 10 and 11q14.1-qter, whereas copy number gains were most frequent on chromosomes 1q, 7, 17q and 20q. Amplifications were delineated to oncogenes such as MITF (3p14), CCND1 (11q13), MDM2 (12q15), CCNE1 (19q12) and NOTCH2 (1p12). Frequent findings of homozygous deletions on 9p21 and 10q23 confirmed the importance of CDKN2A and PTEN. Pair-wise comparisons revealed distinct sets of alterations, for example, mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutual mutations in BRAF and PTEN, concomitant chromosome 7 gain and 10 loss and concomitant chromosome 15q22.2-q26.3 gain and 20 gain.

We validated several putative PTEN ceRNAs and further characterized one, the ZEB2 transcript. We show that ZEB2 modulates PTEN protein levels in a microRNA-dependent, protein coding-independent manner. Attenuation of ZEB2 expression activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, enhances cell transformation, and commonly occurs in human melanomas and other cancers expressing low PTEN levels.

Loss of RICTOR in turn prevents mTORC2 activation, which is critical for melanoma formation and growth.

We expanded our previous survey of PTEN/MMAC1 mutations and analyzed the RAS status of 53 cutaneous melanoma cell lines, 18 glioma cell lines, and 17 uncultured cutaneous melanoma metastasis.

PTEN has also been found to be somatically deleted, mutated, and/or silenced in various sporadically occurring cancers such as glioblastoma, breast cancer, kidney cancer, malignant melanoma, and endometrial cancer. Loss or reduction of PTEN protein expression as well as inappropriate subcellular compartmentalization is seen in non-medullary thyroid cancers. However, although allelic loss of the PTEN locus in 10q23.3 is frequently seen, this is not coupled with mutations in the PTEN gene. To approach further the frequency and mechanism behind PTEN silencing, we screened a panel of 87 sporadic thyroid tumors for PTEN mRNA expression, including 14 anaplastic carcinomas, 37 follicular carcinomas, 21 atypical adenomas, and 15 ordinary adenomas. Complete loss of PTEN mRNA expression was evident in six of the tumors, including four anaplastic carcinomas, one widely invasive carcinoma, and one ordinary adenoma. The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors. No association was observed between the expression, loss of heterozygosity, and mutation status in the 33 cases in which these parameters were compared. This indicates that PTEN silencing is a result of a wide variety of epigenetic and/or structural silencing mechanisms rather than a consequence of structural biallelic inactivation of the classical type. Furthermore, the high rate of alterations in the 10q23 region might indicate the presence of an as-yet unknown tumor-suppressor gene with an important role in the development of thyroid tumors.",

Higher copy number of CCND1 (P=0.009) and lower copy number of CDKN2A (P=0.012) at baseline were significantly associated with decreased PFS. Although no melanomas had high-level amplification of BRAF, the two patients with progressive disease as their best response had BRAF copy gain in their tumors.;Copy number changes in CDKN2A, CCND1, and mutation/copy number changes in PTEN correlated with the duration of PFS in patients treated with dabrafenib. The results suggest that these markers should be considered in the design and interpretation of future trials with selective BRAF inhibitors in advanced melanoma patients.",

Akt accelerates degradation of p53.;We assessed the expression of PTEN, phospho-Akt (p-Akt), and p53 by immunohistochemistry in benign acral nevi, acral dysplastic nevi, and acral melanomas in the radial growth phase and with a vertical growth component.;Ten specimens in each group were included.

The final score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score by the proportion score.;All specimens of benign acral nevi except one showed some degree of PTEN-negative cells. The numbers of p-Akt and p53-positive cells were higher in acral dysplastic nevi and melanoma than in benign nevi. P-Akt scores were 1.7, 1.8, 2.6, and 4.4, and p53 scores were 2.0, 2.1, 3.8, and 4.1 in each group.

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib significantly improved overall survival. However, brain metastases still limit the effectiveness of this therapy. In a series of patients, we observed that treatment with vemurafenib resulted in substantial regression of extracerebral metastases, but brain metastases developed. This study aimed to identify factors that contribute to treatment resistance in brain metastases. Matched brain and extracerebral metastases from melanoma patients had identical ERK, p-ERK, and AKT immunohistochemistry staining patterns, but there was hyperactivation of AKT (p-AKT) and loss of PTEN expression in the brain metastases. Mutation analysis revealed no differences in BRAF, NRAS, or KIT mutation status in matched brain and extracerebral metastases. In contrast, AKT, p-AKT, and PTEN expression was identical in monolayer cultures derived from melanoma brain and extracerebral metastases. Furthermore, melanoma cells stimulated by astrocyte-conditioned medium showed higher AKT activation and invasiveness than melanoma cells stimulated by fibroblast-conditioned medium. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling resensitized melanoma cells isolated from a vemurafenib-resistant brain metastasis to vemurafenib. Brain-derived factors appear to induce hyperactivation of the AKT survival pathway and to promote the survival and drug resistance of melanoma cells in the brain. Thus, inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling shows potential for enhancing and/or prolonging the antitumor effect of BRAF inhibitors or other anticancer agents in melanoma brain metastases.",

Although the reasons for monosomy in cancer has remained obscure, one possibility is that multiple tumor suppressor genes residing on this chromosome must be lost in unison during tumor progression, and this is easier to accomplish by chromosome segregation rather than by multiple mutational and/or deletion events. The localization and identification of these genes has been hampered by the monosomy itself, which has resulted in a paucity of small defining deletions in tumors. Here, we have addressed the issue of monosomy in tumor development by using functional complementation mapping to localize and demonstrate the existence of different melanoma suppressor genes on chromosome 10 and assigned each locus a distinct tumorigenic phenotype. We report that a locus on 10q distal to 10q23.1, likely involving the PTEN tumor suppressor, causes a severe reduction in the kinetics of melanoma tumor formation in animals. In contrast, a previously unrecognized region at 10p15.3 has a distinct, but lesser, effect on in vivo melanoma growth. Thus, the loss of both of these regions, which is accomplished by tumor-associated monosomy, provides a significant growth advantage over the individual loss of either region, thereby explaining the monosomy observed in sporadic melanomas.",

The energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to be a major cellular target of biguanides. Based on our discovery of cross-talk between the AMPK and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) signaling pathways, we investigated the antitumor effects of combining phenformin with a BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 on the proliferation of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells in vitro and on BRAF-driven tumor growth in vivo. Cotreatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines with phenformin and PLX4720 resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell viability, compared with the effects of the single agent alone. Moreover, treatment with phenformin significantly delayed the development of resistance to PLX4720 in cultured melanoma cells. Biochemical analyses showed that phenformin and PLX4720 exerted cooperative effects on inhibiting mTOR signaling and inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, phenformin selectively targeted subpopulations of cells expressing JARID1B, a marker for slow cycling melanoma cells, whereas PLX4720 selectively targeted JARID1B-negative cells. Finally, in contrast to their use as single agents, the combination of phenformin and PLX4720 induced tumor regression in both nude mice bearing melanoma xenografts and in a genetically engineered BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(null)-driven mouse model of melanoma. These results strongly suggest that significant therapeutic advantage may be achieved by combining AMPK activators such as phenformin with BRAF inhbitors for the treatment of melanoma. ",

Sustained PI3'-lipid production commonly occurs via silencing of the PI3'-lipid phosphatase PTEN or, less commonly, through mutational activation of PIK3CA, encoding the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI3'-kinase-α (PI3Kα). To define the PI3K catalytic isoform dependency of BRAF-mutated melanoma, we used pharmacologic, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors in conjunction with melanoma-derived cell lines and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. Although BRAF(V600E)/PIK3CA(H1047R) melanomas were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of selective PI3Kα blockade, inhibition of BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(Null) melanoma proliferation required combined blockade of PI3Kα, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ, and was insensitive to PI3Kβ blockade. In GEM models, isoform-selective PI3K inhibition elicited cytostatic effects, but significantly potentiated melanoma regression in response to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted inhibition. Interestingly, PI3K inhibition forestalled the onset of MEK inhibitor resistance in two independent GEM models of BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma. These results suggest that combination therapy with PI3K inhibitors may be a useful strategy to extend the duration of clinical response of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies.;Although BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies elicit melanoma regression, the onset of drug resistance limits the durability of response. Here, we show that combined treatment with PI3K inhibitors significantly forestalled the onset of MEK1/2 inhibitor-resistant disease in BRAF-mutated GEM melanoma models. These results provide a conceptual framework for the combined deployment of BRAF(V600E) plus PI3K pathway-targeted inhibitors in the treatment of a subset of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma.",

In this study, we elucidated the involvement of the up-regulation of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT cascades in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer and melanoma by analyzing the genes and molecules in these cascades. Twelve cell lines, six melanoma and six endometrial cancer, were analyzed; 4 (67%) of the 6 melanomas had gene mutations in the RAS/MAPK cascade, and a decrease or loss of PTEN expression was also observed. These results suggested that simultaneous up-regulations in these two cascades play important roles in carcinogenesis of melanocytes. However, no activation of AKT by phosphorylation was observed. On the other hand, 4 (67%) of the 6 endometrial cancer cell lines had mutually exclusive up-regulations in these cascades.

Melanomas from both groups of bigenic RXRα(ep-/-) mice are larger in size with higher proliferative capacity, and exhibit enhanced angiogenic properties and increased expression of malignant melanoma markers. Analysis of tumor adjacent normal skin from these mice revealed altered expression of several biomarkers indicative of enhanced melanoma susceptibility, including reduced expression of tumor suppressor p53 and loss of PTEN, with concomitant increase in activated AKT. Loss of epidermal RXRα in combination with UVB significantly enhances invasion of melanocytic cells to draining lymph nodes in bigenic mice expressing oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) compared with controls with functional RXRα.

Amplification of CCND1, CDK4, and other loci was significantly increased in cell lines without BRAF-NRAS mutations and so was the loss of chromosome arms 13q and 16q. Our data suggest involvement of distinct genetic pathways that are driven either through oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations complemented by aberrations in the CDKN2A and PTEN genes or involve amplification of oncogenic genomic loci and loss of 13q and 16q.

Epigenetic profiling showed that the multiple metastases after a single primary melanoma share similar methylation patterns for many genes, although differences in methylation between the lesions were evident for several genes, example, PTEN, TFAP2C, and RARB. In addition, DNA copy number and global gene expression profiles of tumors from individual patients were highly similar, confirming common origin of metastases. Some of the identified genomic aberrations, for example, gain of chromosome 6p and loss of chromosomes 6q and 10, persisted during progression, indicating early changes highly important for melanoma development. Homozygous deletions at 3p26.1 and 6q23.2-q23.3 appeared in two consecutive metastases originating from the same primary tumor, respectively, in a mutually exclusive manner that provides evidence for two genetically different subclones. However, in another case, the similarity of the copy number aberrations in subsequent metastatic lesions suggests sequential metastatic development through the clonal evolution.

This leads to increased PI3K/AKT signaling associated with reduced DNA methylation and increased cell proliferation in NRAS-mutant melanoma. Here, we provide additional data that indicates a reciprocal regulation of PREX2 by PTEN whereby loss of PTEN results in a dramatic increase in expression of PREX2 at the protein level. Pharmacologic studies revealed destabilization of PREX2 by inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling. Additionally, we provide data to show a selective decrease in a particular histone mark, H4 Lys20 trimethylation, in cells expressing PREX2 (E824*) truncating mutation globally and at the imprint control region of CDKN1C (also known as p57) and IGF2. The decrease in H4K20 trimethylation coupled with DNA hypomethylation at this particular locus is associated with genomic imprinting and regulation of expression of p57 and IGF2.

It is thus important to have a better understanding of the molecular resistance mechanisms to improve patient survival benefit from these agents. Here we show that BRAFV600E is a negative regulator of the AKT pathway. Expression of BRAFV600E in NIH3T3 cells significantly suppresses MEK inhibitor (RG7167) or mTORC1 inhibitor (rapamycin) induced AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) and downstream signal activation. Treatment-induced pAKT elevation is found in BRAF wild type melanoma cells but not in a subset of melanoma cell lines harboring BRAFV600E. Knock-down of BRAFV600E in these melanoma cells elevates basal pAKT and downstream signals, whereas knock-down of CRAF, MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 or treatment with a BRAF inhibitor have no impact on pAKT. Mechanistically, we show that BRAFV600E interacts with rictor complex (mTORC2) and regulates pAKT through mTORC2. BRAFV600E is identified in mTORC2 after immunoprecipitation of rictor. Knock-down of rictor abrogates BRAFV600E depletion induced pAKT. Knock-down of BRAFV600E enhances cellular enzyme activity of mTORC2. Aberrant activation of AKT pathway by PTEN loss appears to override the negative impact of BRAFV600E on pAKT. Taken together, our findings suggest that in a subset of BRAFV600E melanoma cells, BRAFV600E negatively regulates AKT pathway in a rictor-dependent, MEK/ERK and BRAF kinase-independent manner. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of feedback loops between the MAPK and AKT pathways.",

Nevertheless, drug resistance develops in treated patients, and strategies to overcome primary and acquired resistance are required. To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in primary resistance to PLX4032, we investigated its effects on cell proliferation and signaling in a panel of 27 genetically characterized patient-derived melanoma cell lines. Cell sensitivity to PLX4032 was dependent on BRAF(V600E) and independent from other gene alterations that commonly occur in melanoma such as PTEN loss, BRAF, and MITF gene amplification. Two cell lines lacking sensitivity to PLX4032 and harboring a different set of genetic alterations were studied as models of primary resistance. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor UO126 but not with PLX4032 inhibited cell growth and ERK activation. Resistance to PLX4032 was maintained after CRAF down-regulation by siRNA indicating alternative activation of MEK-ERK signaling. Genetic characterization by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed the activation of MET and SRC signaling, associated with the amplification of MET and of CTNNB1 and CCND1 genes, respectively. The combination of PLX4032 with drugs or siRNA targeting MET was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing cell invasion and migration in melanoma cells with MET amplification; similar effects were observed after targeting SRC in the other cell line, indicating a role for MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance to PLX4032.

Mutations or deletions of PTEN have been observed in up to 60% of melanoma cell lines, resulting in PI3K/Akt activation. The Forkhead family of transcription factors induce apoptosis in their unphosphorylated forms and were recently reported to be a substrate of Akt kinase. In the present study, an adenovirus expressing a triple mutant (TM) of FKHRL1, which cannot be phosphorylated by Akt, was assessed for its ability to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells. Marked overexpression of FKHRL1/TM was evident in the SK-MEL-2 cell line 24 hours after infection with Ad-FKHRL1/TM by Western blot analysis. The expression of FKHRL1/ TM was moderately delayed in SK-MEL-28 cells. Overexpression of FKHRL1/TM can efficiently inhibit melanoma cell growth and result in rapid loss of cell viability. Cell cycle analysis showed overexpression of FKHRL1/TM in both melanoma cell lines resulted in development of a Sub-G1 population, indicating apoptosis by Ad-FKHRL1/TM infection. Apoptosis was confirmed by morphologic inspection, poly-ADP-ribosepolymerase (PARP) cleavage assay, and annexin V-PE analysis. After Ad-FKHRL1/TM infection, the expression of Bax and Bak did not differ markedly, whereas Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) levels decreased markedly. Involvement of caspase 3 and 6 in FKHRL1/TM-mediated apoptosis was demonstrated by cleavage of caspase 3/CPP32 and PARP as well as fragmentation of the caspase 6 substrate lamin B in SK-MEL-2 cells as early as 24 hours after Ad-FKHRL1/ TM infection, but those events were delayed 72 hours in SK-MEL-28. In addition, we found that p27(kip1) was cleaved in SK-MEL-2 cells at 24 hours after treatment with Ad-FKHRL1/TM. This cleavage was observed in SK-MEL-28 cells until 72 hours after infection with Ad-FKHRL1/TM.

The unification of genotype-specific cell line data revealed the enrichment for the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoskeletal proteins to be associated with the presence of a BRAF mutation and oncogenic NRAS to be associated with increased receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. A number of proteins including cell cycle regulators (cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin dependent kinase 2, and cyclin dependent kinase 3), MAPK pathway components (Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and Extracellular signal regulated kinase 2), interferon regulators (tyrosine kinase-2), GTPase regulators (Ras-Rasb interactor 1), and controllers of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A) were common to all genotypes. Treatment of a BRAF-mutant/phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) null melanoma cell line with vemurafenib led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK, phospholipase C1, and β-catenin with increases in receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, signal transduction and activator of signaling 3, and glycogen synthase kinase 3α noted. In NRAS-mutant melanoma, MEK inhibition led to increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway components, Src family kinases, and protein kinase Cδ with decreased phosphorylation seen in STAT3 and ERK1/2.

Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities are common and include 6p gain, associated with a good prognosis, as well as 1p loss, 3 loss, and 8q gain, which correlate with high mortality. These are identified by techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation, comparative genomic hybridisation, microsatellite analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. UM can also be categorised by their gene expression profiles as class 1 or class 2, the latter correlating with poor survival, as do BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) inactivating mutations.

The dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in tumor initiation, cell growth and survival, invasion and angiogenesis, thus, PI3K and mTOR are promising therapeutic targets for cancer. We discovered GDC-0980, a selective, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of Class I PI3 kinase and mTOR kinase (TORC1/2) with excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmaceutical properties. GDC-0980 potently inhibits signal transduction downstream of both PI3K and mTOR, as measured by pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers, thereby acting upon two key pathway nodes to produce the strongest attainable inhibition of signaling in the pathway. Correspondingly, GDC-0980 was potent across a broad panel of cancer cell lines, with the greatest potency in breast, prostate, and lung cancers and less activity in melanoma and pancreatic cancers, consistent with KRAS and BRAF acting as resistance markers. Treatment of cancer cell lines with GDC-0980 resulted in G1 cell-cycle arrest, and in contrast to mTOR inhibitors, GDC-0980 induced apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, including those with direct pathway activation via PI3K and PTEN. Low doses of GDC-0980 potently inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models including those with activated PI3K, loss of LKB1 or PTEN, and elicited an exposure-related decrease in PD biomarkers.

This important observation has led a number of research teams, including our own, to collect DNA samples and clinical data from prostate cancer families, with the goal of localizing and characterizing prostate cancer susceptibility genes. The candidate tumor suppressor gene PTEN (also called MMAC1) has recently been shown to be somatically altered in several common malignancies, including cancers of the brain, kidney, skin, thyroid, endometrium, breast, and prostate. Germ-line mutations in this gene, which maps to chromosome 10q23, have been associated with Cowden disease, an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome that is characterized by multiple hamartomas. Although prostate cancer is not typically associated with Cowden disease, previous studies of sporadic prostate cancers demonstrate loss of heterozygosity at 10q23 loci in approximately 25% of cases. We, therefore, hypothesized that germ-line mutations in the PTEN gene may predispose to prostate cancer in a subset of families, particularly those in which cancers of the breast, kidney, and/or thyroid also segregate. To test this hypothesis, DNA was isolated from whole blood of 11 prostate cancer patients from 10 unrelated families. Four of the 10 families met the previously established clinical criteria for hereditary prostate cancer. Eight of the II men had at least one second primary malignancy, including cases of neuroendocrine cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, melanoma, kidney, and thyroid cancer. Although we identified some common as well as some unique polymorphisms, no nonsense or missense mutations were identified in any of the 11 samples. To further examine the possibility that PTEN mutations contribute to prostate cancer predisposition, we also studied the probands from each of 10 families with early-onset and/or multiple individuals with prostate cancer. Sequence analysis of the PTEN gene in these 10 men also revealed no mutations or novel polymorphisms. We conclude that germ-line mutations in the PTEN are unlikely to contribute in a significant way to the inherited predisposition to prostate cancer.",

The molecular determinants of immune resistance are poorly understood. We show that loss of PTEN in tumor cells in preclinical models of melanoma inhibits T cell-mediated tumor killing and decreases T-cell trafficking into tumors. In patients, PTEN loss correlates with decreased T-cell infiltration at tumor sites, reduced likelihood of successful T-cell expansion from resected tumors, and inferior outcomes with PD-1 inhibitor therapy. PTEN loss in tumor cells increased the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines, resulting in decreased T-cell infiltration in tumors, and inhibited autophagy, which decreased T cell-mediated cell death. Treatment with a selective PI3Kβ inhibitor improved the efficacy of both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in murine models. Together, these findings demonstrate that PTEN loss promotes immune resistance and support the rationale to explore combinations of immunotherapies and PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors.;This study adds to the growing evidence that oncogenic pathways in tumors can promote resistance to the antitumor immune response.

Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

A PTEN mutant associated with Cowden's disease (PTEN;G129E) has protein phosphatase activity yet is defective in dephosphorylating inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate in vitro and fails to arrest cells in G1. These data suggest a link between induction of a cell-cycle block by PTEN and its ability to dephosphorylate, in vivo, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. In keeping with this notion, PTEN can inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 3,4, 5-trisphosphate-dependent Akt kinase, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and constitutively active, but not wild-type, Akt overrides a PTEN G1 arrest. Finally, tumor cells lacking PTEN contain high levels of activated Akt, suggesting that PTEN is necessary for the appropriate regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.",

Vemurafenib, an oral BRAF V600 inhibitor, has pronounced activity in patients with metastatic melanoma, but its activity in patients with BRAF V600E-positive metastatic CRC was unknown.;In this multi-institutional, open-label study, patients with metastatic CRC with BRAF V600 mutations were recruited to an expansion cohort at the previously determined maximum-tolerated dose of 960 mg orally twice a day.;Twenty-one patients were enrolled, of whom 20 had received at least one prior metastatic chemotherapy regimen. Grade 3 toxicities included keratoacanthomas, rash, fatigue, and arthralgia. Of the 21 patients treated, one patient had a confirmed partial response (5%; 95% CI, 1% to 24%) and seven other patients had stable disease by RECIST criteria. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months. Patterns of concurrent mutations, microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylation status, PTEN loss, EGFR expression, and copy number alterations were not associated with clinical benefit. In contrast to prior expectations, concurrent KRAS and NRAS mutations were detected at low allele frequency in a subset of the patients' tumors (median, 0.21% allele frequency) and were apparent mechanisms of acquired resistance in vemurafenib-sensitive patient-derived xenograft models.;In marked contrast to the results seen in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, single-agent vemurafenib did not show meaningful clinical activity in patients with BRAF V600E mutant CRC. Combination strategies are now under development and may be informed by the presence of intratumor heterogeneity of KRAS and NRAS mutations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inhibition of protein synthesis by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) at Ser(51) occurs as a result of the activation of a family of kinases in response to various forms of stress. Although some consequences of eIF2alpha phosphorylation are cytoprotective, phosphorylation of eIF2alpha by RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is largely proapoptotic and tumor suppressing. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor protein that is mutated or deleted in various human cancers, with functions that are mediated through phosphatase-dependent and -independent pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the eIF2alpha phosphorylation pathway is downstream of PTEN. Inactivation of PTEN in human melanoma cells reduced eIF2alpha phosphorylation, whereas reconstitution of PTEN-null human glioblastoma or prostate cancer cells with either wild-type PTEN or phosphatase-defective mutants of PTEN induced PKR activity and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of PTEN were compromised in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lacked PKR or contained a phosphorylation-defective variant of eIF2alpha. Induction of the pathway leading to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha required an intact PDZ-binding motif in PTEN. These findings establish a link between tumor suppression by PTEN and inhibition of protein synthesis that is independent of PTEN's effects on phosphoinositide 3'-kinase signaling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"To evaluate dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, combined with trametinib, a selective MEK inhibitor, in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).;A total of 43 patients with BRAF V600-mutant mCRC were treated with dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus trametinib (2 mg daily), 17 of whom were enrolled onto a pharmacodynamic cohort undergoing mandatory biopsies before and during treatment. Archival tissues were analyzed for microsatellite instability, PTEN status, and 487-gene sequencing. Patient-derived xenografts were established from core biopsy samples.;Of 43 patients, five (12%) achieved a partial response or better, including one (2%) complete response, with duration of response > 36 months; 24 patients (56%) achieved stable disease as best confirmed response. Ten patients (23%) remained in the study > 6 months. All nine evaluable during-treatment biopsies had reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK relative to pretreatment biopsies (average decrease ± standard deviation, 47% ± 24%). Mutational analysis revealed that the patient achieving a complete response and two of three evaluable patients achieving a partial response had PIK3CA mutations. Neither PTEN loss nor microsatellite instability correlated with efficacy. Responses to dabrafenib plus trametinib were comparable in patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice and the biopsied lesions from each corresponding patient.;The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib has activity in a subset of patients with BRAF V600-mutant mCRC. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was inhibited in all patients evaluated, but to a lesser degree than observed in BRAF-mutant melanoma with dabrafenib alone. PIK3CA mutations were identified in responding patients and thus do not preclude response to this regimen. Additional studies targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in this disease are warranted.",
