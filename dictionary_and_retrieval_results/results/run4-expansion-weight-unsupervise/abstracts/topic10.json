        "Doc_abstract":"Point mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently been identified in mucosal, acral lentiginous, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas. We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous, chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in BRAF or c-kit have been reported in malignant melanoma. Because the activating mutations are dominant, it has been assumed that they are heterozygous in the affected tumors. To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing electropherograms on 43 BRAF mutation-positive and 3 c-kit mutation-positive malignant melanomas to determine the ratio of the normal to mutant allele. Of the 43 BRAF mutation-positive tumors, we classified 26 as presumptive heterozygous. Eight cases were indeterminate. Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the mutant allele. BRAF fluorescence in situ hybridization on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the mutant BRAF allele was due to amplification (2 cases) or chromosome 7 polysomy (7 cases). We have previously described the presence of the c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, in 2 of 100 malignant melanomas. In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the L576P mutation. Evaluation of the DNA sequencing electropherograms from all 3 cases of L576P mutation-positive melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal allele. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-kit on these 3 L576P mutation-positive tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the c-kit gene and the other 2 were present in a nonamplified diploid state. These results have important implications concerning the mechanism of oncogenesis in melanoma as well as in the response of the tumor to anticancer drugs targeting BRAF or c-kit.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mucosal and acral melanomas have demonstrated different genetic alterations and biological behavior compared with more common cutaneous melanomas. It was recently reported that gain-of-function KIT mutations and/or copy number increases are more common in mucosal and acral melanomas. Thus, we studied the frequency and pattern of KIT aberrations in mucosal and acral melanomas in Korea. We analyzed 97 patients who were pathologically confirmed with mucosal or acral melanoma between 1997 and 2010 at Samsung Medical Center. Of the 97 melanoma patients, 92 were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13, 17, and 18, BRAF and NRAS genes. KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative, real-time PCR. Of the 97 patients, 55 (56.7%) were mucosal, 40 (41.2%) were acral melanoma, and two were of unknown primary origin. Among seven cases with KIT mutation, five (60.0%) occurred in exon 11, one (20.0%) in exon 17, and one (20.0%) in exon 13. Point mutations were the most common, resulting in substitutions in exon 11 (K558R, T574A, L576P, and V559A), exon 13 (N655K), and exon 17 (N822K). A novel Thr574Ala (c.1720A>G) KIT mutation, which has not been reported in melanoma or other tumor types, was identified in one genital melanoma case. Of the 97 mucosal or acral melanoma specimens, 49 were tested for KIT gene copy number changes using quantitative PCR. Increased KIT copy number was identified in 15 patients: seven (40%) of 20 acral melanomas and eight (31%) of 26 mucosal melanomas. Our study implicates that a significant proportion of acral and mucosal melanomas have KIT mutations in Asian population.",

A number of reports have consistently demonstrated that mucosal and acral melanomas more commonly harbor KIT-activating mutations than do other subtypes. Success in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors with imatinib has led to speculation that KIT-mutated melanoma might also be effectively managed using this approach. A 78-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of rectal bleeding. A colonoscopy revealed a black polypoid mass, 30 mm in diameter, originating near the dentate line, and a biopsy revealed malignant melanoma. Computed tomography showed multiple liver and lung metastases. A KIT mutation analysis showed the L576P mutation in exon 11. The patient did not want to undergo chemotherapy including a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, so palliative radiotherapy for rectal symptoms was performed, but the patient died 4 months later due to disease progression. We describe the first case of anorectal melanoma with a KIT-activating mutation in Japan and summarize findings from the literature regarding the efficacy of KIT kinase inhibitors on this melanoma subtype.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in the BRAF kinase have been reported in a large number of cases of malignant melanoma. This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene. The presence of BRAF- and c-kit-activating mutations in malignant melanoma suggests new approaches to treating this disease involving specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove worthwhile and that mutation analysis by high-resolution melting analysis might help guide therapy.",

We evaluated the anti-tumor activity and safety of nilotinib, a KIT inhibitor, in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT alterations, either mutations or amplifications.;This study was open-label, single center, prospective phase II clinical trial. Between October 2009 and April 2011, 11 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT gene mutations or KIT gene amplifications were enrolled in the first stage of phase II study and nilotinib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoint was response rate and secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).;Of 11 patients, 9 patients were evaluable for treatment response. Of 9 patients, three patients had KIT mutations in exon 11, Leu576Pro, Val559Ala and Lys558Arg; and 6 patients had KIT amplifications > 50 copies compared to control DNA. Two patients achieved partial response (22.2%) and 5 patients achieved stable disease (55.6%). In two patients who responded to nilotinib, both had KIT mutations and showed durable response for 8.4 months and 10.0+ months. Of note, one patient with KIT amplification had stable disease with response for 6 months. A decrease in tumor size from baseline was observed in four patients (44.4%). Nilotinib 800 mg/d was very well tolerated with grade 1 nausea and grade 1 dry-eye being the most common adverse events.;We have decided to publish the preliminary results because anti-tumor activity of nilotinib was promising in KIT mutated patients. Although our results are preliminary, nilotinib had very favorable toxicity profile with durable response in metastatic melanoma patients with KIT mutations. The anti-tumor activity of nilotinib in melanoma patients with KIT amplification is yet to be determined in future studies. Currently, phase II nilotinib trial is ongoing in Korea as multi-center study.",

Most mutations are in exon 17, although exon 11-activating mutations have recently been described. For patients refractory to standard therapeutic protocols for seminoma, the presence of c-kit-activating mutations in some of these neoplasms might suggest an alternative therapy with KIT targeting drugs. We used the novel mutation scanning technique, high-resolution melting amplicon analysis, to screen a series of 22 testicular seminomas for c-kit-activating mutations. Four cases (18%) had exon 17-activating mutations and these included D816Y, D816V, Y823N and one case that contained both D816E and D820H. A single case (5%) had an exon 11-activating mutation. Interestingly, the exon 11-activating mutation was L576P, the same mutation that characterizes the rare c-kit mutation-positive cases of malignant melanoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for c-kit suggested that most seminomas are probably polysomic for c-kit and there was not a significant difference in c-kit FISH characteristics between the mutation-positive and mutation-negative cases. The use of high-resolution melting amplicon analysis as a screening technique will allow for the rapid identification of patients with testicular seminomas whose tumors contain c-kit-activating mutations.
