Each contains a transmembrane subunit with two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains that act as ligand for ErbB2. MUC4 and ErbB2 mediate intracellular signaling pathways that are linked to repression of apoptosis and either to proliferation or to differentiation of tumor cells. This study investigates the expression of human MUC4 in neoplastic and corresponding non-neoplastic tissues, and the relation of MUC4 expression in neoplastic tissues to ErbB2 expression, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and tumor stage in a series of 100 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). MUC4 and ErbB2 expressions and cell proliferation (PCNA) were shown using immunohistochemistry. Apoptotic index (AI) and tumor differentiation were determined by morphologic criteria. All the non-neoplastic bronchial tissues and 85% of NSCLCs showed MUC4 expression. MUC4 expression was found to be higher in neoplastic than in non-neoplastic tissues (Yates correction p: 0.0006). MUC4 expression was inversely correlated with AI (p=0.0002) and was correlated with ErbB2 expression (p=0.022), but not with PCNA counts and tumor stage. Our results indirectly suggest that MUC4, in association with ErbB-2, might be involved in the repression of apoptosis and differentiation rather than proliferation in tumor cells of NSCLCs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and its family members play an important role in the development and progression of lung cancers. It has been reported that somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR or ERBB2 genes occur in a subset of patients with lung cancer. We searched for mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) to determine the prevalence of these mutations in Korean lung cancer patients. In addition, we examined the relationship between the mutations and clinicopathologic features of lung cancers. Mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequencing in 115 surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers. EGFR mutations were present in 20 patients (17.4%). The EGFR mutations were found only in adenocarcinomas (20 of 55 adenocarcinomas, 36.4%). The ERBB2 mutation was found in 1 adenocarcinoma of the 115 NSCLCs (0.9% overall; 1.8% of the 55 adenocarcinomas). KRAS mutations were found in 6 (5.2%) of the 115 NSCLCs (2 of 60 squamous cell carcinomas, or 3.3%, and 4 of 55 adenocarcinomas, or 7.3%). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were more frequent in women (P = 0.02) and in never-smokers (P = 0.004). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were not associated with pathologic stage in never-smokers, but were more frequent in pathologic stage II-IV than in stage I in ever-smokers (P = 0.01). Of the 55 adenocarcinomas, 25 (45.5%) had mutations of one or another of the three genes; EGFR mutations were never found in adenocarcinomas together with ERBB2 or KRAS mutations. These findings suggest that the EGFR mutation is frequent in Korean lung cancer patients, and that the ERBB2 mutation is rare. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of EGFR mutations in the carcinogenesis of adenocarcinoma among smokers.",

Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene at the kinase domain have been found in lung cancer patients. These mutations are correlated with clinical response to targeted molecular therapy. Although Caucasian lung cancer patients have been shown to harbor Braf and erbB2 mutations, only a few reports exist concerning Braf and erbB2 mutations in Japanese lung cancer patients. We investigated the Braf and erbB2 mutation status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing. The study included 305 surgically removed lung cancer samples from the Nagoya City University Hospital, which were EGFR and Kras wild-type centric. Six Braf mutations were found in the adenocarcinoma cases. Among the adenocarcinoma cases, Braf mutations were more frequently noted in heavy smokers (Brinkman index >400, p=0.0476). We also detected five erbB2 mutations all in the non-smokers. All of these mutations existed exclusively. The erbB2 gene mutations were predominantly found in non-smokers with adenocarcinomas.

Human bronchiole epithelial cells and rat type II pneumocytes were found to express p185HER2 at low to undetectable levels by Western blot technique. In contrast, 13 lung cancer cell lines expressed p185HER2, and eight of these 13 expressed p185HER2 at levels at least 2-fold higher than that found in normal bronchiole epithelial cells or type II pneumocytes. Genomic Southern analysis showed that amplification of the HER2 gene was present in only one of the eight cell lines that expressed p185HER2 at these higher levels. Increased levels of steady-state HER2 mRNA occurred in the remaining seven cell lines. We conclude that in human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines the most common mechanism resulting in increased p185HER2 expression is due to mechanisms that increase HER2 mRNA levels, with HER2 gene amplification occurring less commonly.",

In adenocarcinomas, HER-2 and COX-2 overexpression were more common, whereas in squamous cell carcinomas, EGFR overexpression was more common.

HDAC inhibitors, such as depsipeptide FR901228 (FK228), induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells by mechanisms that cannot be attributed solely to histone acetylation. This study evaluated the mechanisms by which FK228 mediates apoptosis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.;Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines that vary in the expression of the growth-regulating proteins p53, pRb, and K-Ras treated with a clinically relevant dose of FK228 (25 ng/mL). Western blot and immunoprecipitation techniques were used to analyze expression of cell-cycle proteins (cyclin A, cyclin E, p53, and p21), signaling-related proteins (ErbB1, ErbB2, and Raf-1), activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), binding of mutant p53 and Raf-1 to heat shock protein (Hsp)90, and acetylation of Hsp90.;FK228 treatment inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells expressing wild-type or mutant p53. FK228 treatment led to altered expression of cyclin A, cyclin E, and p21, and to reduced expression of mutant, but not wild-type, p53. FK228-treated cells also were depleted of ErbB1, ErbB2, and Raf-1 proteins, and exhibited lower ERK1/2 activity. FK228 treatment also inhibited the binding of mutant p53 and Raf-1 to Hsp90; this inhibition was associated with acetylation of Hsp90.;FK228 depletes the levels of several oncoproteins that are normally stabilized by binding to Hsp90 in cancer cells. The resulting ability of FK228 to diminish signal transduction via pathways involving Raf-1 and ERK may contribute to the potency and specificity of this novel antitumor agent.",

In particular, cancers with specific EGFR-activating mutations seem to be the most sensitive to these agents. However, despite their initial response, such cancers almost invariably develop resistance. In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a novel compound, PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor. The results from these studies show that PF00299804 is a potent inhibitor of EGFR-activating mutations as well as the EGFR T790M resistance mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, PF00299804 is a highly effective inhibitor of both the wild-type ERBB2 and the gefitinib-resistant oncogenic ERBB2 mutation identified in lung cancers.

First, we evaluated expression levels of EGFR and HER2/neu by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation respectively; EGFR protein was detected in two of the five SCLC cell lines, whereas HER2/neu was not detected in any. Next, we analyzed expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and compared these results with EGFR (HER-1/ErbB1) and HER2/neu (ErbB2) expression levels, as EGFR conducts signals through Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway; gefitinib inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by EGF addition in cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression.

We sequenced the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2 in 671 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 80 NSCLC cell lines, and 55 SCLCs and other neuroendocrine lung tumors as well as 85 other epithelial cancers (breast, bladder, prostate, and colorectal cancers) and compared the mutational status with clinicopathologic features and the presence of EGFR or KRAS mutations. HER2 mutations were present in 1.6% (11 of 671) of NSCLC and were absent in other types of cancers. Only one adenocarcinoma cell line (NCI-H1781) had a mutation. All HER2 mutations were in-frame insertions in exon 20 and target the identical corresponding region as did EGFR insertions. HER2 mutations were significantly more frequent in never smokers (3.2%, 8 of 248; P=0.02) and adenocarcinoma histology (2.8%, 11 of 394; P=0.003). In 394 adenocarcinoma cases, HER2 mutations preferentially targeted Oriental ethnicity (3.9%) compared with other ethnicities (0.7%), female gender (3.6%) compared with male gender (1.9%) and never smokers (4.1%) compared with smokers (1.4%). Mutations in EGFR, HER2, and KRAS genes were never present together in individual tumors and cell lines. The remarkable similarities of mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes involving tumor type and subtype, mutation type, gene location, and specific patient subpopulations targeted are unprecedented and suggest similar etiologic factors.

These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known.;We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients. Lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were found to be highly resistant towards AEE788 treatment but remained sensitive towards the dual irreversible inhibitors CL-387785 and WZ-4002.;Patients harbouring certain ERBB2 kinase domain mutations at diagnosis may not benefit from lapatinib treatment. Moreover, secondary lapatinib resistance may develop due to kinase domain mutations.

Oncogene mRNA in the tumors was quantified by comparison with the homogeneously weak signals in normal lung tissue preparations with densitometry. The presence of two- to four-fold excess RNA was defined as moderate and a greater than fourfold RNA amount as strong gene overexpression. In contrast to normal tissue the oncogene mRNA amount varied considerably among tumors, showing increases up to 64-fold in erbB2, 13-fold in Ki-ras, and 57-fold in c-myc. Moderate and strong (in brackets) mRNA overexpression occurred with 33% (33%) in erbB2, 36% (18%) in Ki-ras, and 18% (23%) in c-myc.

Thus, ErbB2 is an important target for cancer therapies. Increased ErbB2 expression has been associated with drug resistance in cancer cells. Herceptin is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of ErbB2. In this study, we aimed to block ErbB2 signaling with Herceptin and assess cytotoxicity and effects on apoptosis, oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), and Survivin expression in Calu-3 cell line. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were used to assess cell viability as a marker of proliferation. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and caspase 3/7 activity were measured as the markers of apoptosis. The relative expressions of NF-kB-p50 and Survivin mRNAs were evaluated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our results show that Herceptin treatment inhibits cell proliferation and activates apoptosis but without effects on Survivin and NF-kB expression in Calu-3 cell line. Intracellular glutathione levels and SOD and CAT activities were decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner associated with oxidative stress. Also, ROS were increased at 24 h. These results provide evidence that Herceptin can be used as a cytotoxic and apoptotic agent in NSCLC.",

HER-2/neu overexpression has evolved as a prognostic/predictive factor in some solid tumors. We reviewed our experience with non-smokers who had CLL and subsequently developed lung carcinoma, in an effort to better understand the clinical course of these patients, and to evaluate the role of HER-2/neu overexpression. We reviewed the records of all patients who had a diagnosis of both CLL and lung carcinoma between 1986 and 2000. HER-2/neu overexpression was estimated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the Hercep test (DAKO). An IHC score of 2+ or greater was considered positive. Overall survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis of lung carcinoma by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Fourteen non-smokers in whom a diagnosis of CLL was made at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of lung carcinoma were identified. The median age for diagnosis of CLL in this group was 67 years while that for lung carcinoma was 70 years. The lung carcinomas included 10 non-small cell (NSCLC) and four small cell (SCLC) carcinomas. Nine specimens (six NSCLC and three SCLC) showed HER-2/neu overexpression. Interestingly, 90% of patients with advanced stage cancer (stage IIIB/IV NSCLC or extensive SCLC) overexpressed HER-2/neu. The presence of CLL did not alter outcome in patients with early stage lung cancer. However, after adjustment for age and performance status, patients with advanced stage NSCLC and CLL had a worse than expected outcome. HER-2/neu overexpression (independent of smoking) may be involved in the development/progression of lung cancer in patients with CLL, and has an associated worse outcome. It is appropriate to consider heightened surveillance of CLL patients for lung carcinoma.",

Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Met receptor families have been identified as important molecular targets for NSCLC. Two EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; erlotinib and gefitinib) are in current clinical use, but a majority of patients do not respond to these targeted therapies. We used receptor TK (RTK) capture arrays to identify receptors active in NSCLC cell lines. As Met and ErbBs were active, we explored the potential therapeutic advantage of combined targeting of Met with ErbB receptor family inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC. We found that Met physically interacts with both EGFR and Her2 in a NSCLC cell line with overexpression/overactivation of Met. Combined use of a dual EGFR/Her2 inhibitor with a Met inhibitor yields maximal growth inhibition compared with the use of EGFR and/or Met inhibitors. This suggests that simultaneous inhibition of multiple RTKs may be needed to effectively abrogate tumour cell growth. Phosphoproteomic analysis by RTK capture arrays may be a valuable tool for identifying the subset of tumours with functional receptor activation, regardless of mechanism.",

Pertuzumab can have antitumor activity in patients with HER-2 present on the tumor without gene amplification or 3+ staining by immunohistochemistry. Preclinical xenograft studies have shown efficacy of pertuzumab in treating NSCLC. Therefore, a trial was undertaken for patients with relapsed NSCLC.;Subjects with advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated previously with chemotherapy were treated with pertuzumab (840 mg i.v. loading dose then 420 mg every 3 weeks).

The present study shows that SM enhances HER2 expression in NSCLC large cell carcinoma H661 and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) H69 cells and may increase the susceptibility of the cells to trastuzumab, the humanized anti-HER2 antibody. The combinational treatment of SM and trastuzumab synergistically augments and inhibits H661 and H69 cell proliferation. After treatment with SM, coexpression of HER2 and topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) H661 and H69 cells is more sensitive to the TOP2 inhibitor, epirubicin. The combinatory use of low concentrations of SM with the low-toxic epirubicin accelerated greater apoptotic cell death than each drug did alone in H661 and H69 cells. Relevant studies have shown that HER2 overexpressing cancer cells are more resistant than HER2 low-expressing cells to the chemotherapeutic agent and tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. These investigations have indicated that HER2 overexpression does not suffice to induce intrinsic and pleomorphic drug resistance. The data presented herein suggest that the expression of HER2 did not influence the SM-induced apoptosis of different types of lung cancer cells and that the SM up-regulation of HER2 and TOP2A expressions simultaneously augmented trastuzumab and epirubicin-induced deaths of lung cancer H661 and H69 cells.",

However, cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies indicate that multiple other specific sites of actual or potential DNA loss may be present in lung cancers. Other changes may include development of drug resistance, and production of growth factors and their receptors. It is tempting to associate specific molecular changes with specific morphological changes, as has been attempted in the colon.

High levels of p185(neu) is correlated with intrinsic chemoresistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. We investigated the effects of tyrphostin AG825, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor preferentially inhibiting HER-2/neu kinase, on the chemosensitivities and on the drug-induced cell cycle changes of NSCLC cell lines that expressed different levels of p185(neu). Compared to the low-p185(neu) expressing cell lines, we found that the high-p185(neu) expressing cell lines were more resistant to doxorubicin, etoposide, and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) but more sensitive to AG825. AG825 was able to significantly enhance the chemosensitivities of the high-p185(neu) expressing cell lines, whereas it had little effect on the chemosensitivities of the low-p185(neu) expressing cells, with a few exceptions in which minor antagonistic effects were observed. Although high concentrations of AG825 could reduce the drug-induced G(2) arrest that was accompanied by the activation of phosphorylated p34(cdc2), we failed to find any remarkably differential effects of AG825 on drug-induced G(2), arrest and the accompanying phosphorylation status of p34(cdc2) of the high- and and the low-p185(neu) expressing cell lines. In summary, tyrphostin AG825 can enhance chemosensitivity in high- but not in low-p185(neu) expressing NSCLC cell lines. This differential effect cannot be explained by the alterations of drug-induced cell cycle changes by AG825.

We have previously reported that the adenovirus type 5 early region 1A (E1A) gene product can suppress HER-2/neu-mediated transformation phenotypes through inhibition of HER-2/neu expression. To find an efficient way to treat HER-2/neu-overexpressing lung cancer with E1A, a replication-deficient adenovirus containing the E1A gene, Ad.E1A(+), was used to transduce E1A into HER-2/neu-overexpressing and low expressing human lung cancer cell lines. Tumour cell growth in vitro and colony formation in soft agarose were greatly inhibited by Ad.E1A(+) transduction in HER-2/neu-overexpressing lung cancer cell lines. In HER-2/neu low expressing cell lines, E1A could not inhibit cell growth in vitro but could reduce the colony formation ability in soft agarose, indicating different effects of E1A in these two types of cancer cells. To test the therapeutic efficacy of E1A to lung cancer by systemic delivery in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were established by intratracheal injection of lung cancer cells and treated by i.v. tail injections of Ad.E1A(+). As a result, Ad.E1A(+) suppressed HER-2/neu overexpression and inhibited intratracheal lung cancer growth. However, no significant tumor suppression effect of Ad.E1A(+) was observed in mice bearing HER-2/neu low expressing cell line when the same therapeutic procedure was followed. Thus, we conclude that systemic delivery of Ad.E1A(+) can efficiently achieve therapeutic effect in HER-2/neu-overexpressing lung cancer in vivo.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of all lung cancer cases and is a highly lethal disease. For the last several decades, the standard treatment for SCLC has been deadlocked, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. HER2 is a member of the HER family and has been reported to be overexpressed in 30% of SCLC cases with poor prognosis. However, the clinical relevance of HER2-targeted therapy for SCLC remains unclear. Here, we first identify that cytotoxic drugs induce significant HER2 overexpression through microRNA-125a (miR-125a) and miR-125b downregulation, which in turn act as a novel therapeutic target for trastuzumab-mediated cellular cytotoxicity in SCLC. In this study, we showed that treatment of the HER2-positive SCLC cells, SBC-3 and SBC-5, with cytotoxic drugs induced a significant upregulation of HER2. Cisplatin (CDDP) treatment of SCLC cells resulted in a significant downregulation of miR-125a and miR-125b. We confirmed that miR-125a and miR-125b bound to the 3'-untranslated regions of HER2 mRNA, and that downregulation of miR-125a and miR-125b resulted in upregulation of HER2 in SCLC cells, suggesting a relationship between cytotoxic drug exposure and miR-125/HER2 dysregulation. Furthermore, using a calcein assay, we demonstrated a significantly enhanced cytotoxic effect of CDDP and trastuzumab that was mediated via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Finally, we clearly demonstrated the enhanced antitumor effect of these agents in an orthotopic lung cancer model in vivo. Our results offer a novel therapeutic strategy for HER2-positive SCLCs by using trastuzumab combined with cytotoxic drugs.",

Biochemical studies show that commonly observed variants of EGFR [G719C, G719S, L858R, L861Q, and Delta746-750 (del15)] are enzyme activating, increasing the tyrosine kinase V(max) and increasing the K(m)((app)) for ATP. The point mutations G719C and L861Q had minor effects on lapatinib K(i)s, whereas EGFR mutations L858R and del15 had a higher K(i) for lapatinib than wild-type EGFR. Structural analysis of wild-type EGFR-lapatinib complexes and modeling of the EGFR mutants were consistent with these data, suggesting that loss of structural flexibility and possible stabilization of the active-like conformation could interfere with lapatinib binding, particularly to the EGFR deletion mutants. Furthermore, EGFR deletion mutants were relatively resistant to lapatinib-mediated inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation in recombinant cells expressing the variants, whereas EGFR point mutations had a modest or no effect. Of note, EGFR T790M, a receptor variant found in patients with gefitinib-resistant NSCLC, was also resistant to lapatinib-mediated inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation. Two HER2 insertional variants found in NSCLC were less sensitive to lapatinib inhibition than two HER2 point mutants. The effects of lapatinib on the proliferation of human NSCLC tumor cell lines expressing wild-type or variant EGFR and HER2 cannot be explained solely on the basis of the biochemical activity or receptor autophosphorylation in recombinant cells. These data suggest that cell line genetic heterogeneity and/or multiple determinants modulate the role played by EGFR/HER2 in regulating cell proliferation.",

However, little is known about the benefit of HER2-targeted therapy for NSCLCs harboring HER2 alterations. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of afatinib, an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-HER2 dual inhibitor, in lung cancers harboring HER2 oncogene alterations, including novel HER2 mutations in the transmembrane domain, which we recently identified. Normal bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, ectopically overexpressing wild-type HER2 or mutants (A775insYVMA, G776VC, G776LC, P780insGSP, V659E, and G660D) showed constitutive autophosphorylation of HER2 and activation of downstream signaling. They were sensitive to afatinib, but insensitive to gefitinib. Furthermore, we examined the antitumor activity of afatinib and gefitinib in several NSCLC cell lines, and investigated the association between their genetic alterations and sensitivity to afatinib treatment. In HER2-altered NSCLC cells (H2170, Calu-3, and H1781), afatinib downregulated the phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR as well as their downstream signaling, and induced an antiproliferative effect through G1 arrest and apoptotic cell death. In contrast, HER2- or EGFR-non-dependent NSCLC cells were insensitive to afatinib. In addition, these effects were confirmed in vivo by using a xenograft mouse model of HER2-altered lung cancer cells.

Here we addressed this question by examining SFK phosphorylation in NSCLC biopsy samples and using genetic and pharmacological approaches to inhibit SFK expression and activity in cultured NSCLC cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of NSCLC biopsy samples using a Tyr416 phosphorylation-specific, pan-SFK antibody revealed staining in 123 (33%) of 370 tumors. Because c-Src is known to be both an upstream activator and downstream mediator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we next investigated SFK phosphorylation in a panel of NSCLC cell lines, including ones that depend on EGFR for survival. The EGFR-dependent NSCLC cell lines HCC827 and H3255 had increased phosphorylation of SFKs, and treatment of these cells with an SFK inhibitor (PP1 or SKI-606) induced apoptosis. PP1 decreased phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 and strikingly enhanced apoptosis by gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor. HCC827 cells transfected with c-Src short hairpin RNA exhibited diminished phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 and decreased sensitivity to apoptosis by PP1 or gefitinib. We conclude that SFKs are activated in NSCLC biopsy samples, promote the survival of EGFR-dependent NSCLC cells, and should be investigated as therapeutic targets in NSCLC patients.",

The currently available TKI (gefitinib and erlotinib) are EGFR reversible inhibitors. Afatinib is an oral, irreversible ErbB family blocker that covalently binds and blocks signaling from EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2) and ErbB4. The compound inhibits also the transphosphorylation of ErbB3. With this mode of action, afatinib is thought to have a mechanistic advantage over EGFR blockade alone, in that it provides a sustained, covalent inhibition of ErbB homo- and hetero-dimers. In the pivotal LUX-Lung 3 study, afatinib demonstrated a prolonged progression free survival over standard pemetrexed plus cisplatin chemotherapy (11.1 versus 6.9 months; HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.43-0.78; P = 0.001) in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients.

In genomically defined NSCLC cell lines, ganetespib caused depletion of receptor tyrosine kinases, extinguishing of downstream signaling, inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis with IC(50) values ranging 2 to 30 nmol/L, substantially lower than those required for 17-AAG (20-3,500 nmol/L). Ganetespib was also approximately 20-fold more potent in isogenic Ba/F3 pro-B cells rendered IL-3 independent by expression of EGFR and ERBB2 mutants. In mice bearing NCI-H1975 (EGFR L858R/T790M) xenografts, ganetespib was rapidly eliminated from plasma and normal tissues but was maintained in tumor with t(1/2) 58.3 hours, supporting once-weekly dosing experiments, in which ganetespib produced greater tumor growth inhibition than 17-AAG. However, after a single dose, reexpression of mutant EGFR occurred by 72 hours, correlating with reversal of antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Consecutive day dosing resulted in xenograft regressions, accompanied by more sustained pharmacodynamic effects.

We show here that somatic deletions in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR were associated with increased EGFR gene copy number in NSCLC.

H1819, a NSCLC cell line that expresses high levels of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 but has wild-type EGFR, showed intermediate sensitivity to TKIs. In both cell lines, ligand-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was delayed and prolonged and AKT was constitutively phosphorylated (but remained inhibitable by EGFR TKI).

Mutations in EGFR pathway genes were significantly more frequent in women and ACs than in women and SCCs (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively). The mutations occurred in a mutually exclusive pattern. When the genes were divided into three subgroups according to their roles in the signaling cascade, mutations in the EGFR/ERBB2 and KRAS/BRAF genes were more frequent in ACs than in SCCs (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). In marked contrast, mutations in the PIK3CA/PTEN were more frequent in SCCs than in ACs (p = 0.002). Furthermore, mutations in the PIK3CA/PTEN genes were more frequent in smokers (p = 0.04).;Our study demonstrates that mutations in each part of the EGFR pathway were associated with different clinicopathologic features in patients with NSCLCs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human cancers usually evolve through multistep processes. These processes are driven by the accumulation of abundant genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. However, some lung cancers depend on a single activated oncogene by somatic mutation, termed 'driver oncogenic mutations', for their proliferation and survival. EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangement are typical examples of such driver oncogenic mutations found in lung adenocarcinomas. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or ALK-TKIs significantly improved treatment outcomes compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, respectively. Therefore, treatment strategies for lung cancers have dramatically changed from a 'general and empiric' to a 'personalized and evidence-based' approach according to the driver oncogenic mutation. Several novel driver oncogenic mutations, which are candidates as novel targets, such as ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET, have been discovered. Despite these successes, several limitations have arisen. One example is that some lung cancers do not respond to treatments targeting driver oncogenic mutations, as exemplified in KRAS-mutated lung cancers. Another is resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. Such resistance includes de novo resistance and acquired resistance. A number of molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance have been reported. These mechanisms can be roughly divided into three categories: alteration of the targeted oncogenes themselves by secondary mutations or amplification, activation of an alternative oncogenic signaling track, and conversion of cellular characteristics. Overcoming resistance is a current area of urgent clinical research.",

For the detection of the oncoproteins the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase-complex method was used. An association between the resistance and c-fos and c-jun proteins was found (c-fos p = 0.01, c-jun p = 0.09), whereas a correlation between resistance and expression of c-neu and c-myc products was not observed. P-glycoprotein 170 was detected immunohistochemically in 91 tumors using the monoclonal antibody JSB-1.

In the present study, we addressed whether there are further significant immunogenic candidate targets that may induce strong immune reactions with a high frequency in lung cancer patients eligible for cellular immunotherapeutic approaches, such as in a polyvalent vaccination approach. In this study, we investigated specific CTL responses of 14 HLA-A*0201-positive patients (of 33 screened patients) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n=12) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC; n=2) against several known and novel TAA-derived peptides from lung cancer and/or other tumor entities, by measuring granzyme B (GrB) and/or interferon γ (IFNγ) secretion using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) analysis. Specific T cell responses could be detected for hTERT (4/13), two MAGE-A3-derived peptides (4/13 and 3/13, respectively), RHAMM (4/14), PRAME (8/14), G250 (7/12), survivin (3/13), HER2 (5/10) and WT1 (2/14), but also novel epitopes derived from Aurora kinase A (4/13) and B (5/13). Additionally, simultaneous CTL responses against the different peptides were examined and specific T cell responses against at least one of these TAAs could be detected in 13/14 (93%) patients. It could be shown that all patients with immune reactions against RHAMM and hTERT showed also immune responses against PRAME. Furthermore, patients with CTL responses against the Aurora kinase A peptide (Aura A1) also demonstrated a response against the Aurora kinase B peptide (Aura B1).

African Americans (AAs) have higher lung cancer incidence and mortality than Caucasians, yet discrepant results have been reported regarding the frequency of somatic driver mutations. We hypothesized that NSCLC has a distinct mutational profile in this group.;We collected NSCLC samples resected from self-reported AAs in five sites from Tennessee, Michigan, and Ohio. Gene mutations were assessed by either SNaPshot or next generation sequencing, and ALK translocations were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;Two hundred sixty patients were included, mostly males (62.3%) and smokers (86.6%). Eighty-one samples (31.2%) were squamous cell carcinomas. The most frequently mutated genes were KRAS (15.4%), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, 5.0%), PIK3CA (0.8%), BRAF, NRAS, ERBB2, and AKT1 (0.4% each). ALK translocations were detected in two nonsquamous tumors (1.7%), totaling 61 cases (23.5%) with driver oncogenic alterations. Among 179 nonsquamous samples, 54 (30.2%) presented a driver alteration. The frequency of driver alterations altogether was lower than that reported in Caucasians, whereas no difference was detected in either EGFR or KRAS mutations. Overall survival was longer among patients with EGFR mutations.;We demonstrated that NSCLC from AAs has a different pattern of somatic driver mutations than from Caucasians. The majority of driver alterations in this group are yet to be described, which will require more comprehensive panels and assessment of noncanonical alterations.",

In pulmonary carcinomas, however, there has been disagreement between the reported frequencies of gene amplification and overexpression. To clarify their relationship, the correlation between the cellular expression of p185(ERBB2) and the level of c-erb B-2 gene amplification was studied. A total of 195 pulmonary carcinomas (182 primary and 13 metastatic) were examined immunohistochemically using a polyclonal antibody, which recognizes the internal domain of the human c-erb B-2 protein, and positive tumors were further examined for the gene amplification by dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes for centromere 17 and 17q11.2--12. By immunohistochemistry, distinct membrane staining was found in an adenocarcinoma, a large cell carcinoma and a metastatic carcinoma from the breast, and cytoplasmic and/or faint membranous staining was observed in 23 non-small cell lung carcinomas. It was in the two primaries and the metastatic carcinoma that more than 8-fold amplification of c-erb B-2 was found by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Especially, in the two primary carcinomas, tumor cells had amplified genes with the signals forming one or two clusters, indicating that the amplified gene was present in homogeneously staining regions. Among the 23 tumors, three tumors showed low-level amplification (less than 3-fold), which was differentiated from polysomy 17 found in the other two. In the 30 non-small cell lung carcinomas selected at random from 151 with negative immunostaining, there were five trisomy 17, but no tumors with the gene amplification. This suggests that although c-erb B-2 amplification in pulmonary carcinoma is rare, it occurs in the form of a homogeneously staining region and is thought to control the overexpression of the protein in the cell membrane. New adjuvant therapy using a humanized antibody to the oncoprotein may be beneficial to patients with these tumors.",

The relationships between their expression levels and clinicopathological factors were evaluated by correlation analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the associations between the expression levels of these proteins and the survival of NSCLC patients.;Leptin was expressed in 71 and 25% (P < 0.05) of NSCLC and normal lung tissues, respectively, while OB-Rb was expressed in 62 and 31% (P < 0.05), respectively. Overexpression of HER-2 was detected in 53% of NSCLC tissues versus 0% of normal lung tissues (P < 0.05). A significant association was found between the expression levels of leptin and OB-Rb (P = 0.024), and between tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and HER-2 expression (P = 0.003). Univariate survival analysis showed that TNM stage (P < 0.001) and leptin expression (P = 0.009) influenced survival time. Multivariate analysis suggested that TNM stage [hazard ratio (HR) 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-2.04, P < 0.001] and leptin expression (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01-2.80, P = 0.044) were independent prognostic factors for NSCLC.;The expression of leptin, OB-Rb and HER-2 was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than in normal lung tissues.

Recent genomic studies in lung adenocarcinoma identified other potential therapeutic targets, including ROS1 rearrangements, RET fusions, MET amplification, and activating mutations in BRAF, HER2, and KRAS in frequencies exceeding 1%. Lung cancers that harbor these genomic changes can potentially be targeted with agents approved for other indications or under clinical development. The need to generate increasing amounts of genomic information should prompt health-care providers to be mindful of the amounts of tissue needed for these assays when planning diagnostic procedures.

Immunohistochemical studies suggest that non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours may over-express HER2. Our aim was to evaluate HER2 gene amplification and semi-quantitative immuno-expression in NSCLC. A total of 344 NSCLC cases were immunostained for HER2 expression in 2 centres using the HercepTest. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis for HER2 gene amplification was performed on most positive cases and a subset of negative cases. Fifteen cases (4.3%) demonstrated 2+ or 3+ membranous HER2 immuno-expression. There was no correlation between immuno-expression and tumour histology or grade. Tumours from higher-stage disease were more often HercepTest-positive (p < 0.001). All 4 HercepTest 3+ cases demonstrated gene amplification. One of the 5 2+ cases tested for gene amplification showed areas of borderline amplification and areas of polyploidy. None of the 19 HercepTest-negative cases demonstrated gene amplification or polyploidy (p < 0.001). Gene amplification was demonstrated in all HercepTest 3+ scoring NSCLC cases. Unlike breast cancer, gene amplification and HER2 protein over-expression assessed by the HercepTest appeared to be uncommon in NSCLC.

Cell-specific RNA was isolated and purified for RT-qPCR and microarray. Comparison of NSCLC cells to normal epithelia indicated increased levels of mRNA expression of ERbeta, ERalpha, EGFR, and HER-2 by 31%, 38%, 54%, and 62%, respectively, in LCs. The majority of NSCLC exhibiting low ERalpha and high HER-2 expression were from smokers. Although there was no correlation between ERbeta or EGFR expression and smoking history, there appeared to be an inverse relationship between levels of ERbeta and EGFR mRNAs in normal and neoplastic lung. Additionally, microarray analyses of LCM cells revealed >2,000 genes significantly altered in LC compared with normal epithelia. Herein, differences in NSCLC gene expression and normal lung cells were noted between specimens from gender and smoking groups. Microarray data revealed ERa expression was associated with alterations in <20 genes while ERbeta expression revealed >500 associated genes, suggesting a more prominent role for ERbeta in lung.

Expression of VHR inhibited the activation of phospholipase Cγ and protein kinase C, both downstream effectors of Tyr-992 phosphorylation of EGFR. Decreasing VHR expression by RNA interference caused higher EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-992. In addition to EGFR, VHR also directly dephosphorylated ErbB2. Consistent with these results, suppression of VHR augmented the foci formation ability of H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, whereas overexpression of VHR suppressed cell growth in both two- and three-dimensional cultures. Expression of VHR also suppressed tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, VHR expression was significantly lower in NSCLC tissues in comparison to that in normal lung tissues.

Concurrent mutations were not observed in case of BRAF V600 mutation, and were identified in 5 patients with BRAF non-V600E mutations, in all cases consisting of KRAS mutations. Non-V600E mutations were more likely to be observed in smokers, as compared V600E mutations. There was no significant difference in age, histologic type, performance status, and stage at diagnosis between cases of V600E and non-V600E mutations. Overall survival did not significantly differ in BRAF wild-type, V600E, and non-V600E patients.;This one of the largest series of patients with BRAF mutant NSCLC. Our clinical data suggest that BRAF mutations define specific subsets of patients with NSCLC; while their oncogenic nature is yet to be established in lung cancer, especially for non-V600E mutations, the value of BRAF mutations to predict the efficacy of targeted agents remains unclear.",

Erlotinib and gefitinib, two EGFR-targeted agents, have been shown to be relevant drugs for lung cancer treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2 receptors, is clinically effective against HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In this report, we investigated the activity of lapatinib against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;We selected the lung cancer cell line A549, which harbors genomic amplification of EGFR and HER-2. Proliferation, cell cycle analysis, clonogenic assays, and signaling cascade analyses (by western blot) were performed in vitro. In vivo experiments with A549 cells xenotransplanted into nude mice treated with lapatinib (with or without radiotherapy) were also carried out.;Lapatinib dramatically reduced cell proliferation (P < 0.0001), DNA synthesis (P < 0.006), and colony formation capacity (P < 0.0001) in A549 cells in vitro. Furthermore, lapatinib induced G1 cell cycle arrest (P < 0.0001) and apoptotic cell death (P < 0.0006) and reduced cyclin A and B1 levels, which are regulators of S and G2/M cell cycle stages, respectively. Stimulation of apoptosis in lapatinib-treated A549 cells was correlated with increased cleaved PARP, active caspase-3, and proapoptotic Bak-1 levels, and reduction in the antiapoptotic IAP-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels. We also demonstrate that lapatinib altered EGFR/HER-2 signaling pathways reducing p-EGFR, p-HER-2, p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, c-Myc and PCNA levels. In vivo experiments revealed that A549 tumor-bearing mice treated with lapatinib had significantly less active tumors (as assessed by PET analysis) (P < 0.04) and smaller in size than controls. In addition, tumors from lapatinib-treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in angiogenesis (P < 0.0001).;Overall, these data suggest that lapatinib may be a clinically useful agent for the treatment of lung cancer.",

HER2 and EGFR overexpression is detected in the cells of many tumours, mainly in breast, lung and oral cancer and may be connected with HER2 gene amplification or point mutations as well as with the presence of overactive polymorphic forms of HER1 gene.

Trastuzumab was effective only in the case of patients with high HER2 expression evaluated by immunohistochemical methods and with gene amplification ascertained by fluorescence in situ hybridisation assays. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HER2 overexpression was detected only in a few cases. Therefore, trastuzumab treatment seems to be problematic in NSCLC patients. A small molecule quinazoline (erlotinib, Tarceva) is a promising therapeutic agent selectively blocking EGFR.

The objective of this study was to examine HER-2/neu expression in a well-defined cohort of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and in nonneoplastic lung tissue utilizing a combination of high-density tissue microarray, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) under uniform test conditions. One hundred forty stage I-IIIA primary NSCLCs and 38 non-neoplastic lung samples were examined. IHC, using an FDA-approved Hercept monoclonal antibody kit, was performed and HER-2/neu gene alteration was assessed by FISH. The association of expression of HER-2/neu with clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. Ninety-four percent of tumor samples (131/140) were fully interpretable after tissue processing. Twenty-five of them (19%) overexpressed (2+, 3+) HER-2/neu, while 106 (81%) had no or weak expression. All thirty-four interpretable non-neoplastic lung samples were negative for HER-2/neu alteration at protein and gene level. HER-2/neu protein overexpression correlated well with HER-2/neu gene amplification (r =.83, P < 0.001). HER-2/neu overexpression was significantly associated with histologic subtype: 19 adenocarcinomas (19/82, 23%) versus 4 squamous cell carcinomas (4/44, 9%) overexpressed Her-2/neu (P = 0.04). Statistical significance was observed between HER-2/neu expression and tumor differentiation, with strong positive (3+) expression observed more frequently in poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.01). Patients with HER-2/neu abnormalities, particularly HER-2/neu gene amplification, exhibited a shorter survival (P = 0.043). The statistically significant difference (P < 0.005) between HER-2/neu alteration in tumor samples(25/131, 19%) and in the nonneoplastic tissue (0/34, 0%) implies that HER-2/neu may have a role in the carcinogenesis of NSCLC. The findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the HER-2/neu receptor may represent a useful molecular target in the treatment of NSCLC. The significant association of HER-2/neu expression and gene amplification with poorly differentiated carcinoma compared with well differentiated carcinoma suggests that HER-2/neu may be involved in NSCLC tumor evolution.

Here, we report mechanistic investigations of the P-gp-evading anti-tumor activity of CDBT. CDBT is evidently not a P-gp substrate and escapes the P-gp efflux pump. As a novel microtubule and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) dual targeting inhibitor, CDBT causes the destabilization of microtubules and degradation of HSP90 client proteins CRAF-1 and ERBB2, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptosis. Furthermore, CDBT effectively inhibits tumor growth by 60.4% relative to the vehicle control after intraperitoneal administration at 30 mg/kg for 11 days and shows no toxicity in normal tissues in the NSCLC H460TaxR xenograft mouse model. Our data suggest a novel drug discovery strategy to combat P-gp over-expressing drug-resistant NSCLC cancer cells with a single therapeutic agent. ",

Trastuzumab induced differential levels of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to HER2-positive SCLC cells. Furthermore, as a mechanism of the differential levels of ADCC, we have revealed that coexpression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on SCLC cells is essential to facilitate and accelerate the trastuzumab-mediated ADCC. Although SN-38-resistant SCLC cells lacking ICAM-1 expression were still refractory to trastuzumab, their in vivo growth was significantly suppressed by bevacizumab treatment due to dependence on their distinctive and abundant production of vascular endothelial growth factor.

Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was used to analyze the CD44 mRNA expression level in NSCLC tissue and DNA sequencing was performed to further verify the CD44 expression level. Differentially expressed genes between tumor tissues and controls were determined by DNA sequencing and the Gene_act_net between CD44 and its associated genes was constructed. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes was performed by the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was performed based on the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer test applied in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. RT‑qPCR results showed that CD34 was overexpressed in 21 of the 36 NSCLC tissues (58.3%).

In the present study, we examined patients with HER-2/ neu(+) breast, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers for preexisting CTL immunity to four recently described HER-2/ neu-derived and HLA-A2-restricted \"cytotoxic\" peptides and to a novel one spanning amino acids 777-785 also with HLA-A2-binding motif. We utilized enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay, which allows a quantitative and functional assessment of T cells directed against specific peptides after only brief in vitro incubation. CTL reactivity was determined with an interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISpot assay detecting T cells at the single cell level secreting IFN-gamma. CTLp were defined as peptide-specific precursors per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Patients' PBMCs with increased CTLp were also tested against autologous tumor targets and peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) in cytotoxicity assays. We also studied patients with HER-2/ neu-negative ((-)) tumors and healthy individuals. Of the HER-2/neu(+) patients examined, 31% had increased CTLp to HER-2(9(952)), 19% to HER-2(9(665)), 16% to HER-2(9(689)), and 12.5% HER-2(9(435)), whereas only 2 of 32 patients (6%) responded to HER-2(9(777)). The CTLp recognizing HER-2(9(952)) were extremely high in two patients with breast cancer, one with lung cancer, and one with prostate cancer. None of the HER-2/neu(-) patients or healthy donors exhibited increased CTLp to any of these peptides. Besides IFN-gamma production, preexisting CTL immunity to all five HER-2/ neu peptides was also shown in cytotoxicity assays where patients' PBMCs with increased CTLp specifically lysed autologous tumor targets and autologous peptide-pulsed DCs. Our results demonstrate for the first time that (1) preexisting immunity to peptides HER-2(9(435)), HER-2(9(952)), HER-2(9(689)), HER-2(9(665)), and HER-2(9(777)) is present in patients with HER-2/ neu(+) tumors of distinct histology, (2) HER-2(9(777)) is a naturally processed peptide expressed on the surface of HER-2/ neu(+) tumors, as are the other four peptides, and (3) HER-2/ neu(+) prostate tumor cells can be recognized and lysed by autologous HER-2 peptide-specific CTL.

As p185HER2 is also expressed in human lung cancers and human lung cancer cell lines, we hypothesized that these cell lines would also respond to p185HER2 antibodies. To test this hypothesis, we cultured human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in the presence of a p185HER2 monoclonal antibody called 4D5. 4D5 inhibited the growth of p185HER2-expressing cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, BEAS.2B, a p185HER2-nonexpressing bronchial epithelial cell line, was transfected with the HER2 cDNA, resulting in high-level p185HER2 expression, and growth of BEAS.HER2 was now inhibited by 4D5 exposure. Mechanistically, 4D5 appeared to have a weak agonist effect on the tyrosine kinase function of p185HER2, as exposure of p185HER2-expressing cell lines to 4D5 resulted in increased p185HER2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of tyrosine kinase function with Genistein reversed the 4D5-induced growth inhibition. Therefore, 4D5 can regulate the growth of p185HER2-expressing lung cancer cell lines through agonist effects on p185HER2.",

Research on non-small cell lung cancer has elucidated factors that may predict response to gefitinib. Less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in HNSCC patients.;We analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the EGFR/ErbB receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established HNSCC lines in vitro. IC50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. ErbB signaling was assessed by Western and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pEGFR, pErbB2, pErbB3, pAkt, and pErk. EGFR sequences encoding kinase domain and EGFR gene copy numbers were determined by cDNA sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. Finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux).;Expression levels of pErbB2 (P = 0.02) and total ErbB3 protein (P = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. Combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (Omnitarg), an antibody targeting ErbB2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines. The same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. In contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between EGFR gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (P = 0.0498) and cetuximab (P = 0.053). No activating EGFR mutations were identified.;EGFR amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in HNSCC. However, other EGFR/ErbB receptor family members than EGFR may contribute to resistance to gefitinib. ErbB2 and ErbB3 may have potential as predictive markers and as therapeutic targets for combination therapy in treatment of HNSCC with gefitinib.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. There is an urgent need for early diagnostic tools and novel therapies in order to increase lung cancer survival. Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIa (sPLA2-IIa) is involved in inflammation, tumorigenesis and metastasis. We were the first to uncover that cancer cells secrete sPLA2‑IIa. sPLA2‑IIa is overexpressed in almost all specimens of human lung cancers examined and is significantly elevated in the plasma of lung cancer patients. High levels of plasma sPLA2-IIa are significantly associated with advanced stage and decreased overall cancer survival. In this study, we further showed that elevated HER/HER2‑PI3K-Akt-NF-κB signaling contributes to sPLA2-IIa overexpression in lung cancer cells. sPLA2-IIa in turn phosphorylates and activates HER2 and HER3 in a time- and dose‑dependent manner in lung cancer cells. The structure and sequence‑based docking analysis revealed that sPLA2-IIa β hairpin shares structural similarity with the corresponding EGF hairpin. sPLA2-IIa forms an extensive interface with EGFR and brings the two lobes of EGFR into an active conformation. sPLA2-IIa also enhances the NF-κB promoter activity. Anti-sPLA2-IIa antibody, but not the small molecule sPLA2-IIa inhibitor LY315920, significantly inhibits sPLA2‑IIa-induced activation of NF-κB promoter. Our findings support the notion that sPLA2-IIa functions as a ligand for the EGFR family of receptors leading to an elevated HER/HER2-elicited signaling. Plasma sPLA2-IIa can potentially serve as lung cancer biomarker and sPLA2‑IIa is a potential therapeutic target against lung cancer.",

To identify the site of interaction, we recently used a chimeric EGFR/ErbB2 receptor approach to show that c-Src requires the kinase region of ErbB2 for binding. Here, we demonstrate that retention of a conserved amino acid motif surrounding tyrosine 877 (referred to here as EGFR(YHAD)) is sufficient to confer binding to c-Src. Surprisingly the association of c-Src was not dependent on its SH2 or SH3 domain or on the phosphorylation or kinase activity of the receptor. We further show that the chimeric EGFRs that contain the Y877 motif are transforming in vitro and in vivo following ligand stimulation. Transformation was also partially dependent on sustained activation of Stat3. Finally, we demonstrate that EGFRs with mutations in the catalytic domain, originally identified in lung cancer and conferring increased sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib, two EGFR kinase inhibitors, gained the capacity to bind c-Src. Moreover, transformation by these EGFR mutants was inhibited by Src inhibitors regardless of their sensitivities to gefitinib and erlotinib. These observations have important implications for understanding the molecular basis for resistance to EGFR inhibitors and implicate c-Src as a critical signaling molecule in EGFR mutant-induced transformation.",

Personalized therapy encompasses the strategy of matching these subtypes with effective targeted therapies. EGFR mutations and ALK translocation are the most effectively targeted oncogenes in NSCLC. EGFR mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are successfully being targeted with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The number of molecular subgroups of NSCLC continues to grow. The scope of this review is to discuss recent data on novel molecular targets as ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, HER2, c-MET, RET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and DDR2. Thereby the review will focus on therapeutic strategies targeting these aberrations. Moreover, the emerging challenge of acquired resistance to initially effective therapies will be discussed. ",

However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities. It is hoped that these discoveries may make a major contribution to improving outcome for patients with this poor prognosis disease. ",

In one attempt to demonstrate the role of tailoring chemotherapy, the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) phase II customized chemotherapy trial (NCT00883480) showed that RAP80, a component of the BRCA1-A complex, influenced outcome in patients with low BRCA1 expression treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine, and in patients with intermediate/high BRCA1 levels receiving cisplatin/docetaxel or docetaxel alone.

Here, we studied dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified lung cancers.;As a prespecified cohort of a phase II study, we included patients with stage IIIB/IV lung cancers with HER2 mutations or amplification. We gave oral dacomitinib at 30-45 mg daily in 28-day cycles. End points included partial response rate, overall survival, and toxicity.;We enrolled 30 patients with HER2-mutant (n = 26, all in exon 20 including 25 insertions and 1 missense mutation) or HER2-amplified lung cancers (n = 4). Three of 26 patients with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 30%] had partial responses lasting 3+, 11, and 14 months. No partial responses occurred in four patients with tumors with HER2 amplifications. The median overall survival was 9 months from the start of dacomitinib (95% CI 7-21 months) for patients with HER2 mutations and ranged from 5 to 22 months with amplifications. Treatment-related toxicities included diarrhea (90%; grade 3/4: 20%/3%), dermatitis (73%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%), and fatigue (57%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%). One patient died on study likely due to an interaction of dacomitinib with mirtazapine.;Dacomitinib produced objective responses in patients with lung cancers with specific HER2 exon 20 insertions.

Additional information on NSCLC cell lines such as that of transcriptomic data, genomic aberrations, and drug sensitivity was analyzed in the context of proteomic data using supervised and non-supervised approaches for data analysis. First, the unsupervised analysis of proteomic data indicated that proteins clustering closely together reflect well-known signaling modules, e.g. PI3K/AKT- and RAS/RAF/ERK-signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. However, mutations of EGFR, ERBB2, RAF, RAS, TP53, and PI3K were found dispersed across different signaling pathway clusters. Merely cell lines with an amplification of EGFR and/or ERBB2 clustered closely together on the proteomic, but not on the transcriptomic level. Secondly, supervised data analysis revealed that sensitivity towards anti-EGFR drugs generally correlated better with high level EGFR phosphorylation than with EGFR abundance itself. High level phosphorylation of RB and high abundance of AURKA were identified as candidates that can potentially predict sensitivity towards the aurora kinase inhibitor VX680. Examples shown demonstrate that the RPPA approach presents a useful platform for targeted proteomics with high potential for biomarker discovery.

We initially analyzed expression and phosphorylation of ERBB family receptors and their major downstream proteins, AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3, in a series of lung cancer cell lines with or without EGFR mutation. The expression levels of EGFR as well as of ERBB2 and ERBB3 proteins in cells with EGFR mutation tended to be higher than those in cells with wild type EGFR. There was no difference in stability between mutant and wild type EGFR proteins. EGF induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3 to various extents, but the level of induction was not associated with the existence of EGFR mutation. These results implied that the activation of AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3 signaling transmitted by EGFR would be critical for the growth and survival of lung cancer cells, but specific features of mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells was not discriminated by these approaches. We therefore performed transfection studies using PC-13 cells with no detectable endogenous EGFR expression. Exogenous expression of wild type and mutant EGFR (delE746-A750) in the cells revealed that only in the mutant EGFR transfected cells, EGFR itself as well as AKT and STAT3 were highly phosphorylated after 24h of serum deprivation. The survival time of mutant EGFR transfected cells was prolonged under serum-free culture conditions, but not under standard culture conditions with 10% serum. These results suggest that cells with a mutant EGFR survive through the activation of the AKT and/or STAT3 pathways, even in low EGF microenvironments. This specific property due to EGFR mutation could be an important step of multistage lung cancer progression.",

In this study, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect HER2 and COX-2 expression in NSCLC tissues. Then, pcDNA3.1-HER2 was used to overexpress HER2, while HER2 siRNA and COX-2 siRNA were used to silence HER2 and COX-2 expression. MTT assay and invasion assay were used to detect the effects of HER2 on cell proliferation and invasion. Our study revealed that HER2 and COX-2 expression were upregulated in NSCLC tissues and HER2 exhibited a significant positive correlation with the levels of COX-2 expression. Overexpression of HER2 evidently elevated COX-2 expression, while silencing of HER2 evidently decreased COX-2 expression. Furthermore, overexpressed HER2 induced the ERK phosphorylation, and this was abolished by the treatment with U0126, a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, an upstream kinase of ERK. HER2-induced expression and promoter activity of COX-2 were also suppressed by U0126, suggesting that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway regulates COX-2 expression. In addition, HER2 induced activation of AKT signaling pathway, which was reversed by pretreatment with U0126 and COX-2 siRNA. MTT and invasion assays revealed that HER2 induced cell proliferation and invasion that were reversed by pretreatment with U0126 and COX-2 siRNA. In this study, our results demonstrated for the first time that HER2 elevated COX-2 expression through the activation of MEK/ERK pathway, which subsequently induced cell proliferation and invasion via AKT pathway in NSCLC tissues.

Gene amplification for EGFR and HER2 is demonstrated in only 5-10% of the tumors. The treatment status and therapeutic limitation with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in lung cancer compared to breast cancer is discussed.",

Here, we report a case of an advanced chemotherapy-resistant NSCLC, harboring a novel HER3(V855A) somatic mutation homologous to the EGFR(L858R)activating mutation. Co-expression of HER3(V855A) and wild-type HER2 enhances ligand-induced transformation of murine and human cell lines, while HER-targeted inhibitors potently suppress mutant HER3 activity. Consistent with these observations, in silico computational modeling predicts that mutant V855A alters the kinase domain and c-terminal end of the HER3 protein. Taken together, these findings provide a basis for the clinical exploration of targeted therapies in HER3 mutant NSCLC and by extrapolation, in other cancers that more frequently carry somatic HER3 mutations.",

Despite improvements in conventional treatment for NSCLC, survival remains poor and improvements in patient outcome are warranted. Over recent years, basic scientific research has dramatically increased our knowledge of the pathogenesis of lung cancer and allowed us to uncover and understand the cellular pathways involved in this process. This has led to the development of therapies to selectively target these pathways. Among these, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase family and related downstream pathways play a critical role in cancer development and over recent years have become a validated target in NSCLC. The development of monoclonal antibodies and first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeted towards EGFR has had a considerable impact on patient outcomes. However, despite dramatic and sustained responses and the discovery of specific patient subgroups that may derive clinical benefit, resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs inevitably develops. A new generation of agents have been developed to provide superior potency of target inhibition and further individualize the treatment of NSCLC. This article reviews EGFR-targeted therapies currently available for use and undergoing clinical development for the treatment of NSCLC, specifically focusing on next generation agents including BIBW 2992, an irreversible dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 kinases.",

As multimodality treatments are now able to ensure better local control and a lower rate of extracranial metastases, brain relapse has become a major concern in lung cancer. As survival is poor after development of brain metastases (BM) in spite of specific treatment, PCI has been introduced in the 1970's. PCI has been evaluated in randomized trials in both SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to reduce the incidence of BM and possibly increase survival. PCI reduces significantly the BM rate in both limited disease (LD) and extensive disease (ED) SCLC and in non-metastatic NSCLC. Considering SCLC, PCI significantly improves overall survival in LD (from 15 to 20% at 3 years) and ED (from 13 to 27% at 1 year) in patients who respond to first-line treatment; it should thus be part of the standard treatment in all responders in ED and in good responders in LD. No dose-effect relationship for PCI was demonstrated in LD SCLC patients so that the recommended dose is 25 Gy in 10 fractions. In NSCLC, even if the risk of brain dissemination is lower than in SCLC, it has become a challenging issue. Studies have identified subgroups at higher risk of brain failure. There are more local treatment possibilities for BM related to NSCLC, but most BM will eventually recur so that PCI should be reconsidered. Few randomized trials have been performed. Most of them could demonstrate a decreased incidence of BM in patients with PCI, but they were not able to show an effect on survival as they were underpowered. New trials are needed. Among long-term survivors, neuro-cognitive toxicity may be observed. Several approaches are being evaluated to reduce this possible toxicity. PCI has no place for other solid tumours at risk such as HER2+ breast cancer patients.",

In some cases, patients with partial response or disease stabilization do not always have EGFR-mutated tumors. To go further in the characterization of the EGF pathway, we screened EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA for mutations in 2 groups of White patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (45 cancers from women and 46 cancers from men). Associations between TP53 mutations, clinicopathologic parameters, and EGF pathway molecular alterations were analyzed. All mutations were exclusive and essentially found in EGFR and KRAS. We demonstrated that EGFR mutations were linked to female sex, absence of smoking, late age at diagnosis, and adenocarcinoma (ADC) with bronchioloalveolar (BAC) features. Moreover, in invasive ADC with BAC component, microdissection assays showed that mutations were retrieved in both tumor subtypes suggesting that EGFR mutations appear early in lung carcinogenesis. On the contrary, KRAS mutations correlated with smoking, younger age at diagnosis, and ADC subtype regardless of BAC differentiation. These results suggest the existence of distinct carcinogenesis pathways both leading to disruption of EGF regulation and targeted either by tobacco carcinogens or by unidentified toxic. The identification of BAC features in ADC helps clustering patients that are more likely to fit the EGFR-mutated group.",

However, a frequently observed in-frame mutation that inserts amino acid quadruplex Tyr776-Val777-Met778-Ala779 at G776 (G776(YVMA)) in HER2 kinase domain can cause drug resistance and sensitivity, largely limiting the application of reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer therapy. A systematic investigation of the intermolecular interactions between the HER2(YVMA) mutant and clinical small-molecule inhibitors would help to establish a complete picture of drug response to HER2 G776(YVMA) insertion in lung cancer, and to design new tyrosine kinase inhibitors with high potency and selectivity to target the lung cancer-related HER2(YVMA) mutant. Here, we combined homology modeling, ligand grafting, structure minimization, molecular simulation and binding affinity analysis to profile a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against the G776(YVMA) insertion in HER2. It is found that the insertion is far away from HER2 active pocket and thus cannot contact inhibitor ligand directly. However, the insertion is expected to induce marked allosteric effect on some regions around the pocket, including A-loop and hinges connecting between the N- and C-lobes of HER2 kinase domain, which may exert indirect influence to inhibitor binding. Most investigated inhibitors exhibit weak binding strength to both wild-type and mutant HER2, which can be attributed to steric hindrance that impairs ligand compatibility with HER2 active pocket. However, the cognate inhibitor lapatinib and the non-cognate inhibitor bosutinib were predicted to have low affinity for wild-type HER2 but high affinity for HER2(YVMA) mutant, which was confirmed by subsequent kinase assay experiments; the inhibitory potencies of bosutinib against wild-type and mutant HER2 were determined to be IC(50) > 1000 and =27 nM, respectively, suggesting that the bosutinib might be exploited as a selective inhibitor for mutant over wild-type HER2. Structural examination revealed that formation of additional non-bonded interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with HER2 A-loop region due to G776(YVMA) insertion is the primary factor to improve bosutinib affinity upon the mutation.",

Since heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) stabilizes various oncoproteins including EGFR and c-Met, the inhibition of Hsp90 activity appears as a rational strategy to develop anticancer drugs. Despite preclinical efficacy of geldanamycin-anasamycin (GA)-derivatives containing benzoquinone moiety as Hsp90 inhibitors, the hepatotoxicity of these GA-derivatives restricts their therapeutic benefit. We have prepared WK-88 series of GA-derivatives, which lack the benzoquinone moiety. In this study, we have examined the anticancer effects of WK88-1 in Met-amplified- and gefitinib-resistant (HCC827GR) NSCLC cells and its parental HCC827 cells. Treatment with WK88-1 reduced the cell viability in both HCC827 and HCC827GR cells, which was associated with marked decrease in the constitutive expression of Hsp90 client proteins, such as EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, Met and Akt. Moreover, WK88-1 attenuated phosphorylation of these Hsp90 client proteins and reduced the anchorage-independent growth of HCC827GR cells. Administration of WK88-1 did not cause hepatotoxicity in animals and significantly reduced the growth of HCC827GR cells xenograft tumors in nude mice. Our study provides evidence that ErbB3 might be a client for Hsp90 in Met-amplified NSCLCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibition of Hsp90 dampens the activation of EGFR- or c-Met-mediated survival of Met-amplified NSCLCs and that WK88-1 as a Hsp90 inhibitor alleviates gefitinib resistance in HCC827GR cells.

The IHC VE1 assay was positive in 19 of 21 (90%) BRAF(V600E)-mutated tumours and negative in all BRAF(nonV600E)-mutated tumours.;IHC using the VE1 clone is a specific and sensitive method for the detection of BRAF(V600E) and may be an alternative to molecular biology for the detection of mutations in NSCLC.",

At the same time, we compared the ability of serum HER-2/neu, CA15.3, CA12-5, CA19-9, carcino embryonic antigen (CEA), and alpha-feto-protein (AFP) in breast, colorectal, and lung cancer patients. Forty, thirty-six, and twenty-three patients with lung, colon and breast cancer were included in this study, respectively. Serum levels of HER-2/neu, CA15.3, CA12-5, CA19-9, CEA, and AFP were measured. Her-2 neu levels were significantly higher in the breast cancer groups than colorectal and lung cancer and controls groups (P < 0.01). There is no significant difference when compared with others groups (P > 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the HER-2/neu and CA15-3 values in breast cancer groups. We found 0.75(0.59-0.90) for Her-2/neu from the area under the curve (AUC). P-value for breast cancer is 0.003, and we discovered that 9 ng/ml was the best inersection point. In this situation, we calculated that sensitivity was 65.2%, specificity was 100%, positive predictive value was 100%, negative predictive value 75.8%, and accuracy was 83.4%. These findings indicate that serum HER2/neu levels are clinically valuable in monitoring metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients. Prognosis of breast cancer provides an additional value over the commonly used CA15-3 test. Measurements of levels of serum HER-2/neu provide prognostic and predictive information to the clinician and can especially be used for monitoring metastatic breast cancer patients. Further clinical validation is needed to confirm these findings.",

In contrast, the diagnosis of other cancers at a young age has been demonstrated to define unique disease biology. Herein, we report on the association of young age with targetable genomic alterations and prognosis in a cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC.;To determine the relationship between young age at diagnosis and the presence of a potentially targetable genomic alteration, disease prognosis, and natural history.;A cohort of all 2237 patients with NSCLC who were genotyped at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between January 2002 and December 2014 were identified. Tumor genotype, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes were collected and studied at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between age and mutation status, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for survival analysis.;The frequency of targetable genomic alterations by defined age categories as well as the association of these age groups with survival. Age categories used in this analysis were younger than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years or older.;A cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC was studied. Of the 2237 participants, 1939 (87%) had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, 269 (12%) had NSCLC not otherwise specified, and 29 (1%) had squamous histologic findings; 1396 (63%) had either stage IIIB or IV cancers; and median (range) age was 62 (20-95) years. We found that gene mutations for EGFR (P = .02) and ALK (P < .001) were associated with cancer diagnosis at a younger age, and a similar trend existed for ERBB2 (P = .15) and ROS1 (P = .10) but not BRAF V600E (P = .43). Among patients tested for all 5 targetable genomic alterations (n = 1325), younger age was associated with an increased frequency of a targetable genotype (P < .001). Those diagnosed at 50 years or younger have a 59% increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype. While presence of a potentially targetable genomic alteration treated with a targeted agent was associated with improved survival, the youngest and oldest age groups had similarly poor outcomes even when a targetable genotype was present.;Younger age is associated with an increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype and is an underappreciated clinical biomarker in NSCLC. The survival of young patients with NCSLC is unexpectedly poor compared with other age groups, suggesting more aggressive disease biology. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive genotyping, including next-generation sequencing, in younger patients with lung cancer.",

Structural dysfunction of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR is associated with the clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with NSCLC. The most common EGFR gene mutations occur as either deletions in exon 19 or as substitution L858R in exon 21 and cause a clinically beneficial response to gefinitib or erlotinib treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of patients finally develop resistance to these drugs. Acquired resistance is linked to secondary mutations localised in the EGFR gene, mainly substitution T790M in exon 20. Through intense research a few different mechanisms of resistance to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been identified: amplification of MET or IGF-1R genes, abnormalities of PTEN and mTOR proteins as well as rare mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes. Extensively investigated new drugs could be of significant efficiency in NSCLC patients with secondary resistance to reversible EGFR TKI. ",

Gefitinib is currently being applied in clinical studies as either a monotherapy, or as part of a combination therapy against prostate, head and neck, gastric, breast, and colorectal tumors. However, success rates vary between different tumor types, and thus it is important to understand which molecular target(s) are responsible for limiting the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. In this study, we ask whether expression of HER2 affects sensitivity to gefitinib in human lung cancer cells. We established two clones, LK2/HER2-32 and LK2/HER2-57, by transfecting HER2 cDNA into LK2, a NSCLC line with a low expression level of HER2. We observed no mutations in exons 18, 19, and 21 of EGFR gene in LK2, LK2/mock- and two HER2-trasfectants when we observed in-frame deletion mutations (E746-A750) adjacent to K745 in a gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell line, PC9. These LK2/HER2-32 and LK2/HER2-57 were much more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of gefitinib than the parental LK2 lines. Treatment with 0.5 to 1 micromol/L gefitinib specifically blocked Akt activation in both HER2-transfectant lines, but not in the parental LK2 cells. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 activation, however, was not blocked by gefitinib up to 10 micromol/L in either the parent or transfectant lines. Gefitinib was also shown to induce cell cycle arrest in the G1-S phase, and an accompanying increase of p27Kip1 was observed. LK2/HER2 transfectants showed constitutive formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimer, which were seen to associate with a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, p85alpha, when active. Treatment of LK2/HER2 cells with gefitinib markedly decreased the formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimers, HER3 basal phosphorylation, and the association of p85alpha with HER3. This study is the first to show that under basal growth conditions, HER2 sensitizes low-EGFR NSCLC cell lines to growth inhibition by gefitinib.",

We examined a panel of 19 lung cancer cell lines to investigate possible association between ZD1839 sensitivity and histological type, expression level and constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR and K-ras gene status. Our results indicate that neither expression level nor constitutive activation status of EGFR seems to predict sensitivity to ZD1839.

In culture ZD1839 inhibited the growth of four NSCLC cell lines (A549, NCI-H23, NCI-H727, and NCI-H661) that expressed various levels of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4. A significant cytotoxic effect was observed when ZD1839 was combined with trastuzumab in A549 cells. However, this combination had no apparent effect in NCI-H23 cells. Significant G(1)-phase arrest, increased p27 expression and decreased cyclin E or D1 levels were detected in A549 cells treated with ZD1839 and trastuzumab. No significant effects were detected in NCI-H23 cells examined. The combination treatment significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, retinoblastoma, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, and protein kinase B/Akt in A549 cells, but not in NCI-H23 cells. Our results indicated that increased levels of constitutive EGFR/HER2 heterodimers were formed in A549 cells in the presence of ZD1839, whereas no heterodimer formation was detected in NCI-H23 cells. We therefore suggest that combination treatment with ZD1839 and trastuzumab might have improved therapeutic efficacy against NSCLC cells expressing both EGFR and HER2.",

Although heterotransplants of certain human solid tumors can be successfully grown in nude mice, they have never been appropriately explored for prediction of in vivo chemosensitivity to anticancer agents. We determined the tumor response rate and studied the influence of several biological and molecular tumor parameters on the in vivo sensitivity to paclitaxel in a series of heterotransplanted human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. One hundred consecutive resected NSCLC tumors were heterotransplanted s.c. in nude mice. The in vivo sensitivity to i.v. paclitaxel (60 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was studied in 34 successfully grown heterotransplants. Treatment started when the tumors reached a size of 5 mm in diameter, and strict standard clinical criteria (>50% shrinkage in tumor weight or cross-sectional surface) were used to define tumor response. Baseline multidrug resistance protein (MRP), Her-2/neu, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, and pre- and posttherapy bax and bcl-2 expression were determined by Western blot analysis. p53 status was determined by sequencing. The overall take rate was 46% (95% confidence interval, 36-56%) and was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for squamous carcinoma tumors (75%) than for adenocarcinoma tumors (30%) and bronchoalveolar tumors (23%). The heterotransplants were morphologically very similar to the original tumors. The response rate to paclitaxel was 21% (95% confidence interval, 9-38%). Baseline tumor parameters associated with response were no Her-2/neu expression (none of the responding tumors expressed Her-2/neu versus 48% of the nonresponding tumors, P = 0.05) and baseline bcl-2 expression (all responding tumors expressed bcl-2 versus only 43% of the nonresponding tumors, P = 0.02). There was a trend toward a higher response rate in bax-positive tumors, and MRP- and EGFR-negative tumors, but it was not statistically significant. The response was independent of baseline p53 status and baseline mitotic index. Responding tumors had a higher bax/bcl-2 ratio 24 h after therapy, but the difference was only marginally significant (2.8 for responding tumors versus 1.1 for nonresponding tumors, P = 0.07). The extent of mitotic arrest at 24 h after therapy was not associated with response. Human NSCLC heterotransplants are morphologically identical to the original tumors and have a response rate to paclitaxel that is equivalent to that reported in Phase II studies in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with single-agent paclitaxel. NSCLC heterotransplants deserve to be explored to evaluate new agents for lung cancer and to predict clinical response on an individual basis in selected groups of patients.",

Second, the CellSearch system identified 15% of patients (n = 48) as CTC positive whereas a multiplex RT-PCR for PIK3CA, AKT2, TWIST, and ALDH1 following EGFR, HER2 and EpCAM based enrichment detected CTCs in 29% of the patients.

Patients harbouring tumours with an altered EGFR genotype were more frequently CTC-positive compared to patients with EGFR wildtype tumours. In subsets of patients, CTCs were found to express genes involved in resistance to therapy such as HER3 and MET.

By use of monoclonal antibody CK2 to the epithelial cytokeratin component number 18 (CK18), individual disseminated carcinoma cells present in bone marrow of cancer patients can now be identified (G. Schlimok, I. Funke, B. Holzmann, G. Göttlinger, G. Schmidt, H. Häuser, S. Swierkot, H. H. Warnecke, B. Schneider, H. Koprowski, and G. Riethmüller, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84: 8672-8676, 1987; F. Lindemann, G. Schlimok, P. Dirschedl, J. Witte, and G. Riethmüller, Lancet, 340: 685-689, 1992). In the present study, we applied this approach to patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer. CK18 was expressed on 84 of 88 (95.5%) primary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Irrespective of primary tumor histology, single aspirates of iliac bone marrow from 18 of 82 (21.9%) lung cancer patients exhibited between 1 and 531 CK18+ cells/4 x 10(5) nucleated marrow cells. The specificity of our assay is underlined by the small rate of \"false-positive\" cells being observed in only 2 of 117 (1.7%) marrow samples from control patients with no evidence for an epithelial malignancy at the time of aspiration. Comparison with established risk factors demonstrated positive correlations (P < 0.05) between the size and histological grade of the primary carcinoma and cytokeratin positivity in iliac bone marrow. In contrast, the association with the metastatic involvement of regional lymph nodes was only weak (P = 0.09). Following a median observation period of 13 months, patients who displayed cytokeratin-positive cells in iliac bone marrow at the time of primary surgery relapsed more frequently as compared to patients with a negative marrow finding (66.7 versus 36.6%; P < 0.05). This difference was even more pronounced by comparing the rates of manifest skeleton metastasis observed in both groups (26.7 versus 2.4%; P < 0.005). Finally, colabeling of CK18+ cells in marrow with monoclonal antibodies to proliferation-associated markers, such as the nucleolar antigen p120 or the tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2, exemplified the oncogenic capacity of CK18+ micrometastatic cells. In conclusion, CK18+ cells present in the bone marrow of patients with apparently operable non-small cell lung cancer exhibit the potential to form solid metastases. Therefore, the approach presented here may be used to determine the risk of early relapse in operable non-small cell lung cancer with potential consequences for adjuvant therapy.",

The mutations in the exons 18-24 of EGFR gene were detected in the tumor tissues from 106 patients before the treatment of gefitinib, and HER2/3 expression in 84 tumor samples were detected by immunohistochemistry.;Mutation was identified in 32 (30.2%) tumor tissues. Overall remission rate was significantly higher in the HER2 high expression patients than in the HER2 low expression patients (36.8% vs 17.4%, P=0.044). HER2 and HER3 expression levels were not associated with time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). The patients with HER2/3 single high expression had relatively longer TTP and OS than those with HER2/3 single low expression (6.1 vs 9.1 months, P=0.725; 6.1 vs 9.0 months, P=0.862), while those with concomitant HER2/3 high expression had significant longer TTP and OS. EGFR-mutated patients with HER2 expression or high HER2 and HER3 expressions were more sensitive to gefitinib.;EGFR mutations combined with HER2/3 expressions is a significant predictor for gefitinib efficacy on Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC.",

Expert consensus has defined minimum requirements for routine testing and identification of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations (15% of tumors harbor EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitutions) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements (5% of tumors) in advanced lung adenocarcinomas (ACs). Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib). Notably, increasing feasibility, accessibility, and application of molecular profiling technologies has permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes. Emerging genomic aberrations for which TKIs have shown impressive results in clinical trials and expansion of drug labels for approved agents are awaited include ROS1 rearrangements (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib) and BRAF-V600E mutations (1-3% of tumors, drugs: vemurafenib, dafrafenib + trametinib). Evolving genomic events in which TKI responses have been reported in smaller series include MET exon 14 skipping mutations (2-4% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); high-level MET amplification (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); RET rearrangements (1% of tumors, drug: cabozantinib); and ERBB2 mutations (2-3% of tumors, drug: afatinib), among others. Unfortunately, the most common genomic event in NSCLC, KRAS mutations (25-30% of tumors), is not targetable with approved or in development small molecule inhibitors. Here, we review currently approved, emerging, and evolving systemic precision therapies matched with their driver oncogenes for the management of advanced NSCLC. ",

The positive rate of EGFR, p-EGFR, and HER2 was 97.2%, 44.4%, and 88.6%, respectively, and the overexpression rate was 80.6%, 0.0%, and 27.8%, respectively. EGFR overexpression and phosphorylation were seen at almost the same rate in each histological type of squamous and nonsquamous cell carcinoma (squamous vs. nonsquamous; 78.6% vs. 81.8% for EGFR, 35.7% vs. 50.0% for p-EGFR), while HER2 overexpression was seen less frequently in squamous cell carcinoma than in nonsquamous cell carcinoma (0.0% vs. 45.5%, P = 0.003). Univariate analysis revealed that EGFR overexpression was related to good performance status (P = 0.038) but not related to EGFR phosphorylation. EGFR phosphorylation was correlated to short time to progression (TTP) (P = 0.002) and poor prognosis (P = 0.002), although EGFR overexpression, HER2 overexpression, or EGFR-HER2 coexpression were not correlated to TTP or survival. Bivariate analysis showed EGFR phosphorylation was related to short TTP and poor prognosis both in early and advanced stages.

We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of these proteins in 92 non-small-cell lung cancer specimens to establish their role in lung cancer pathogenesis. Neu was overexpressed in 65% of cases, and although STAT3 was overexpressed in 52.1% in cytoplasm, it was expressed in nucleus (activated) in 60.8%.

Interestingly, we found nuclear expression of Bcl-xL in 30.4% of cases. Finally, we found correlation among histological types of lung cancer and nuclear expression of both STAT5 (P=0.005) and nuclear Bcl-xL (P=0.003). Besides, nuclear expression of Bcl-xL was correlated with TNM stage IV (distant metastasis) (P=0.02).

In this study, we examined the molecular basis of sensitivity to gefitinib using nine human lung cancer cell lines derived from NSCLC. PC9 was the most sensitive to gefitinib of the nine NSCLC cell lines when assayed either by colony formation or MTS assays. The various cell lines expressed different levels of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4, but there was no correlation between levels of EGFR and/or HER2 expression and drug sensitivity. Phosphorylation of EGFR, protein kinase B/AKT (Akt), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was inhibited by much lower concentration of gefitinib in PC9 cells than in the other eight cell lines under exponential growing conditions. About 80% of cell surface EGFR in PC-9 was internalized within 10 min, whereas only about 30-50% of the cell surface EGFR was internalized in more drug-resistant cell lines in 15-60 min. The present study is the first to demonstrate that sensitivity to growth inhibition by gefitinib in NSCLC cell lines under basal growth condition is associated with dependence on Akt and ERK1/2 activation in response to EGFR signaling for survival and proliferation and also that drug sensitivity may be related to the extent of EGF-induced down-regulation of cell surface EGFR.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Over the past 30 years, a relatively simple growth factor and its cognate receptor have provided seminal insights into the understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, as well as growth factor signalling. The epidermal growth factor (EGF), its cognate receptor (EGFR) and related family members have been shown to be important in normal, as well as the malignant growth of many cell types including: glioblastomata, astrocytomas, medulloblastomata, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and breast cancer. This review summarises the history of the EGFR gene and the v-ErbB oncogene, as well as diverse approaches developed to inhibit EGFR activity. The two most advanced therapies use either small-molecule cell membrane permeable kinase inhibitors or antibodies which prevent receptor activation. Recent clinical trials indicate that certain NSCLC patients have mutations in the EGFR gene which makes them more responsive to kinase inhibitors. These mutations appear to enhance the ability of the ligand to activate EGFR activity and also prolong the binding of the EGFR inhibitor to the kinase domain. Evidence to date suggests that these EGFR mutations in NSCLC occur more frequently in Japan than in the western hemisphere. Although these mutations are correlated with enhanced efficacy to the inhibitors in NSCLC, they can not explain or predict the sensitivity of many other cancer patients to the beneficial effects of the EGFR kinase inhibitors or antibody mediated therapy. As with as other small-molecule kinase inhibitors and susceptible diseases (e.g., imatinib and chronic myeloid leukaemia), resistance to EGFR inhibitors has been reported recently, documenting the requirement for development of multi-pronged therapeutic approaches. EGFR kinase inhibitors are also being evaluated as adjuvants in hormonal therapy of breast cancer - especially those which overexpress EGFR. Genetically engineered antibodies specific for the EGFR family member ErbB2 have been developed which show efficacy in the treatment of primary, and prevent the relapse of, breast cancer. Clearly, the EGF/EGFR signalling cascade has, and continues to play, an important role in the development of novel anticancer targeted therapies.",

Despite these achievements, tumour progression almost always occurs and a reassessment of the tumour genetic profile may contribute to modulating the therapeutic regimen. Resampling may provide tissue for additional tests to detect acquired resistance and/or new genetic alterations, but the currently available information is limited.;Histological and genetic reassessments of biopsy or surgical tissue samples from 50 non-squamous NSCLC patients before and after at least one systemic treatment were performed. EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and HER2 mutations were sequenced, p.T790M was identified with real-time PCR, and ALK and MET genomic alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;Overall in baseline biopsies, 37/50 (74 %) tumours had genetic alterations, either single (52 %) or multiple (22 %). Among them, 16 were EGFR mutations and 6 ALK rearrangements. In the second tissue sampling, 54 % of cases had additional genomic changes, including newly acquired alterations (81 %) or losses (18 %). The commonest changes were MET amplification and p.T790M mutation. One case had a histological shift from adenocarcinoma to small cell carcinoma.;The remarkable number of molecular changes following systemic therapy and the genetic complexity of some cases underline the value of histological and molecular re-evaluation of lung cancer to tailor the most appropriate therapy during disease progression.",

We reasoned that the simultaneous modulation of multiple radioresponse regulators by selenium should increase radiosensitivity if selenium is combined with radiation in cancer therapy. Therefore, we explored the possibility of whether we could obtain an enhancement of radiosensitivity by the combination of selenium and ionizing radiation. We used two human lung cancer cell lines, NCI-H460 and H1299, as well as a human diploid lung fibroblast, WI-38, as the normal cell counterpart. The combined treatment of the cancer cell lines with Seleno-methionine and ionizing radiation resulted in increased cell killing as assessed by clonogenic survival assay whereas it had little effect on the normal diploid WI-38 cells. The increased radiosensitivity in the cancer cells was correlated with the attenuation of the key proteins involved in either cell survival signaling [Akt, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), ErbB2 and Raf1] or DNA damage response (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1, Ku80, 53BP1 and DNAPK). The attenuation of the proteins by the selenium compound was possibly caused by the effect on transcription and on protein stability since selenium treatment decreased both the RNA transcript and the protein stability of EGFR and DNAPK. By contrast, Seleno-L-methionine had no effect on the protein profile of a normal diploid fibroblast which is consistent with an intact radiosensitivity. These data provide possible clinical applications, as selenium selectively enhanced the radiosensitivity of the tumor cells whereas that of the normal cells was unaffected. Moreover, the selective decrease of cell proliferation signaling in tumor cells but not in normal cells should facilitate the repopulation of normal cells required for healing during radiation therapy. On the whole, the results suggest that the cancer preventive activity of selenium can be combined with ionizing radiation to improve the control of lung cancer.",

Presentations at this meeting provided the outline of this report, which has also been supplemented with available data from the current literature.;The predictive factors for both the natural history and the therapy outcome of NSCLC are grouped as follows: (1) tumor related factors (anatomic factors); the extent of tumor (tumor stage) is one of most important prognostic factors affecting the therapy outcome. Tumor size (T stage), anatomical structures involved (T4 vs. T3 lesion), and the presence of regional lymph node metastasis have a significant impact on both prognosis and response to appropriate therapy; (2) host-related factors (clinical factors) that are important in therapy response include performance status, weight loss of more than 10% of body weight in the previous 6 months, and associated co-morbidities, i.e. pulmonary and cardiac diseases; (3) technical factors of radiation therapy which play a decisive role in successful outcome. The target volume should be defined accurately using modern imaging studies. The radiation dose fractionation schedule, in terms of the dose intensity and total dose, should be high enough to provide local tumor control in the majority of patients. Three-dimensional (3-D) conformal planning is an essential tool in dose escalation studies to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation; (4) biological/radiobiological/metabolic factors. Biologic markers resulting from genetic lesions in lung cancer are grouped as follows: (a) oncogene amplification and overexpression (aberrant gene expression) and mutated tumor suppressor genes -- ras gene, myc gene, HER-2/neu and survivin gene, p53 and mutated beta-tubulin gene; (b) tumor biologic/radiobiologic factors -- tumor cell proliferation kinetics, hypoxia, intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity, gamma factor, and DNA content; (c) enzymes and hormones: neuron-specific enolase, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and enhanced glucose metabolic rate supported by increased glucose transporter protein. The surviving fraction of tumor cells at 2.0 Gy of radiation (SF2) as a measure of intrinsic tumor cell radiosensitivity, potential doubling time (T(Pot)) as a measure of the rate of tumor cell proliferation and gamma factor representing the slope of the survival curve at 50% survival rate are being investigated as potential predictors for therapy response. Enhanced glucose utilization, a hallmark of malignant transformation, is being studied as a potential monitor for therapy response by using PET-FDG.;Current data indicate that there is a dose-response relationship between radiation dose and local tumor control, and also between local tumor control and survival in stage III NSCLC. Therapeutic factors, i.e. total radiation dose, fractionation schedule and dose intensity, and use of 3-D conformal radiation to secure the optimum therapeutic ratio are important for improved local tumor control and survival. Future research should be directed towards radiation dose escalation using 3-D conformal therapy to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation in chemo-radiotherapy, and the use of this MTD for improved local tumor control and survival. Radiobiological, molecular, and metabolic markers may have potential for monitoring tumor response and optimizing radiation therapy.",

ErbB receptors activate a multiplicity of intracellular pathways via their ability to interact with numerous signal transducers. Furthermore, there are now many ErbB-targeted inhibitors used in the clinic. In this review we will concentrate on breast tumors with ERBB2 gene amplification/receptor overexpression and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. We will discuss data showing the important role that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays, not only in cancer development, but also in response to targeted therapies.

Tissue macro-arrays prepared from surgical resection specimens from 35 patients with typical carcinoid (TC), six with atypical carcinoid (AC), 13 with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and 15 with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. Hybridizations with locus-specific DNA probes demonstrated a high incidence of deletion for the tumour suppressor genes p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), and for the oncogene cyclin D1, comparable in all carcinoma types. Similarly, an increase of DNA copy number for the Her-2/neu and c-myc oncogenes was noted in all neoplasms. A more detailed quantitative analysis of the results, however, demonstrated increasing numbers of cells harbouring these genomic alterations, from low-grade TC to highly malignant SCLC, with the exception of cyclin D1 deletion. Mutations of the p53 and Rb genes, as assayed by immunohistochemical studies, were observed at high incidence in high-grade carcinomas, compared with a low incidence in the low-grade carcinomas. Conversely, in all carcinoma types, neither membrane-bound Her-2/neu nor nuclear cyclin D1 was detected. It is concluded that structural genomic alterations are frequent in neuroendocrine lung carcinomas and that their occurrence may be underestimated by immunohistochemical studies alone.

Large-scale genomics have recently expanded the lung cancer landscape with FGFR1 amplification found in 10-20% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, the response rates have been low for biomarker-directed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor therapy in SCC, which contrasts to the relatively high rates of response seen in EGFR mutant and ALK-translocated lung cancers treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ALK inhibitors, respectively. In order to better understand the low response rates of FGFR1-amplified lung cancers to FGFR inhibitors, relationships between gene copy number, mRNA expression and protein expression of FGFR1 were assessed in cell lines, tumor specimens and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The importance of these factors for the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors was determined by analyzing drug screen data and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. We report that there was a discrepancy between FGFR1 amplification level and FGFR1 protein expression in a number of these cell lines, and the cancers with unexpectedly low FGFR1 expression were uniformly resistant to the different FGFR inhibitors. Further interrogation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these discordant cell lines revealed co-activation of HER2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) caused by gene amplification or ligand overexpression maintained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling even in the presence of FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, co-inhibition of FGFR1 and HER2 or PDGFRα led to enhanced drug responses. In contrast, FGFR1-amplified high FGFR1 protein-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to FGFR inhibitor monotherapy by downregulating ERK signaling. Addition of a PI3K inhibitor to these high FGFR1 protein-expressing cancers further sensitized them to FGFR inhibitor. These data reveal that biomarker-directed trials for FGFR1-amplified SCC require assessment of FGFR1 protein expression and uncover novel therapeutic strategies for FGFR1-amplified SCC with low FGFR1 protein expression.

Defective endocytosis characterizes a deletion mutant of EGFR, as well as a point mutant (L858R-EGFR), whose association with c-Cbl and ubiquitinylation are impaired. Our data raise the possibility that refractoriness of L858R-EGFR to downregulation is due to enhanced heterodimerization with the oncogene product HER2, which leads to persistent stimulation.",

We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 110 consecutive NSCLC specimens for which epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation testing was performed between November 2011 and December 2011 using Sanger sequencing. Using the Snapshot assay, mutation statuses were detected for EGFR, Kirsten rate sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), v-ras neuroblastoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), dual specificity mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in patient specimens and cell line DNA. Snapshot data were compared to Sanger sequencing data. Of the 110 samples, 51 (46.4%) harbored at least one mutation. The mutation frequency in adenocarcinoma specimens was 55.6%, and the frequencies of EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, and MEK1 mutations were 35.5%, 9.1%, 3.6%, 0.9%, and 0.9%, respectively. No mutation was found in the HER2, NRAS, or BRAF genes. Three of the 51 mutant samples harbored double mutations: two PIK3CA mutations coexisted with KRAS or EGFR mutations, and another KRAS mutation coexisted with a PTEN mutation. Among the 110 samples, 47 were surgical specimens, 60 were biopsy specimens, and 3 were cytological specimens; the corresponding mutation frequencies were 51.1%, 41.7%, and 66.7%, respectively (P = 0.532).

The objectives of this study were to analyze pathological specimens using immunohistochemistry for NE markers, p53 and HER2 to determine if there was a correlation between marker expression and response or survival. Of 160 eligible patients, 28 (18%) were not evaluable because of inadequate material. The percentage of specimens positive for markers was as follows: neuron-specific enolase 38%, Leu-7 2%, chromogranin A 0%, synaptophysin 5%, > or =2+NE markers 3%, p53 61%, and HER2 65%. There was no statistically significant correlation between any individual marker and response to induction chemotherapy or response to combined chemotherapy/radiation except for synaptophysin. Six of 6 (100%) synaptophysin positive tumors responded by the completion of all therapy compared with 69/125 (55%) synaptophysin negative tumors (P=0.04). None of the individual markers had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis. Neuron-specific enolase was marginally significant in multivariate analysis (P=0.08). In conclusion, this study did not demonstrate that expression of NE markers, p53 and HER2 were predictive of response to chemotherapy, combined chemotherapy/radiation or for survival in this group of patients with stage III NSCLC.

Preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies show that ceritinib is more effective against both crizotinib sensitive and resistant tumors. Although robust responses to crizotinib are observed in NSCLC harboring ALK mutations, majority of tumors eventually become resistant, posing a major challenge in treatment course. Thus, there is a need for the identification and development of second-generation of ALK inhibitors. Computer aided molecular docking data show Tivozanib and Lapatinib bind EML4-ALK with high score. Tivozanib is in clinical trials for renal cell cancer and Lapatinib is a known dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor effective in breast cancer patients with HER2 over-expression. Additional data on these compounds for use in EML4-ALK positive NSCLC will provide evidence for use in patients treated with crizotinib.

Several EGFR-targeted agents produce objective responses in a minority of unselected patients, but a majority of those with EGFR-activating mutations; however, all responders eventually develop resistance. The modest activity of agents that target only EGFR may be due, in part, to the complexity and interdependency of HER family signaling. The interdependent signaling that occurs between EGFR and HER2 provides a rationale for the simultaneous inhibition of these receptors with reversible and irreversible inhibitors. Several agents with activity against both EGFR and HER2 are currently under development. Irreversible EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (e.g., BIBW 2992, HKI-272) and pan-HER TKIs (e.g., PF00299804) comprise a novel class of agents in clinical development that may prevent and overcome inherent and acquired resistance to first-generation reversible EGFR TKIs. Other agents in development include the monoclonal antibody pertuzumab, and XL-647, which inhibits EGFR and HER2, as well as multiple vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family members.

Distinguishing prognostic from predictive makers is crucial to the development of customized drug therapy. Some markers, such as mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are prognostic; patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC have prolonged survival compared with those with wild-type disease, regardless of the treatment received. Although EGFR mutations are predictive of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, they do not appear to be predictive of a differential effect on survival. Other EGFR markers, such as protein expression or gene amplification, may be better predictors of a survival benefit from EGFR TKI. HER2 expression status and K-ras mutations provide additional information that may be useful in evaluating a patient for EGFR TKI therapy. Biological markers for chemosensitivity and resistance are also emerging. Patients with an elevated DNA repair capacity, evidenced by increased tumor expression of excision repair cross-complementing 1 or ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 messenger RNA, may benefit less from cisplatin and gemcitabine, respectively, than from other agents. Increased levels of class III beta-tubulin are associated with taxane-resistance, and K-ras mutations have been associated with a lack of survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC.

In combination group, no significant difference of disease-free survival rate (P=0.903) and survival time (P=0.238) was found between patients with histopathologic regression and patients without histopathologic regression; high gene expression had no correlation with pathologic regression (P= 0.862); the mean disease-free survival time was significantly lower in high gene expression subgroup than in low gene expression subgroup [(14.1+/-9.8) months vs. (27.2+/-13.6) months, P=0.032]; the 2-year disease-free survival rate was 38.1% in high gene expression subgroup, and 46.7% in low gene expression subgroup (P=0.607).;Pathologic regression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has no correlation with disease-free survival rate and survial time. The high gene expression maybe indicate high risk of postoperative metastasis; the necessity of postoperative chemotherapy needs further study.",

Based on supporting preclinical studies, we undertook a Phase II trial of pertuzumab in patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;Patients with previously treated NSCLC accessible for core biopsy and naive to HER pathway inhibitors were treated with pertuzumab i.v. once every 3 weeks. Tumor assessments were done at 6 and 12 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter. The primary efficacy end point was overall response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Measurement of tumor glucose metabolism (SUVmax) by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was used as an exploratory pharmacodynamic marker of drug activity.;Of 43 patients treated with pertuzumab, no responses were seen; 18 of 43 (41.9%) and 9 of 43 (20.9%) patients had stable disease at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. The median and 3-month progression-free survival rates (PFS) were 6.1 weeks (95% confidence interval, 5.3-11.3 weeks) and 28.4% (95% confidence interval, 14.4-44.2%), respectively. Of 22 patients who underwent F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, six (27.3%) had a metabolic response to pertuzumab as evidenced by decreased SUV max. These patients had prolonged PFS (HR = 0.11, log-rank P value = 0.018) compared with the 16 patients who had no metabolic response. Four patients (9.3%) experienced a grade 3/grade 4 adverse event judged related to pertuzumab; none exhibited grade 3/grade 4 cardiac toxicity.;Pertuzumab is well tolerated as monotherapy.

Microscopically, the involved pleurae are infiltrated by numerous tumor foci, which suggests that the cancer cells are highly invasive. Overexpression of HER-2/neu has been related to proliferation, antiapoptosis, and the high invasiveness of various cancer cells. We therefore were interested in studying the role of HER-2/neu in MPE-associated adenocarcinoma cell lung cancer (ADCLC).;The expression of HER-2/neu in pleural effusion was measured by ELISA. The HER-2/neu protein expression on tumor cells was evaluated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and gene amplification was assayed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;The mean value of HER-2/neu in pleural effusions of patients with ADCLC and other nonmalignant lung diseases was 9.9 and 2.7 ng/ml, respectively. The difference is statistically significant (P < 0.001). Compared with cytokeratin 19 fragment CYFRA 21-1, the performance of HER-2/neu as a tumor marker in pleural effusion diagnosis was better. Overexpression of HER-2/neu in tumor tissues was found in 70% (23 of 32) of patients with MPE-associated ADCLC, 30% (13 of 43) with stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 44% (14 of 32) with stage III NSCLC. The incidence of HER-2/neu overexpression in tumor tissues of patients with MPE-associated ADCLC was significantly higher than that of patients with stage I-III NSCLC without MPE. HER-2/neu gene amplification was uncommon (1.9%). The correlation between the IHC H-score in tumor samples and the pleural effusion level of HER-2/neu was significant (P < 0.01). A higher incidence of HER-2/neu expression beyond the cutoff point (5.5 ng/ml) in pleural effusions was also found in patients whose IHC H-scores were >50.;These findings indicate that HER-2/neu is important in the pathogenesis of MPE-associated ADCLC and is a potential tumor marker for a diagnosis of pleural effusion.",

All patients received two cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and vinorelbine prior to the operation. The response to therapy was assessed as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD), on the basis of CT scans performed before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. p53 and HER2/neu protein expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against p53 (clone PAb 1801, Novocastra) and against HER2/neu (Dako) in paraffin-embedded specimens of tumors. A response to therapy (CR+PR) was observed in 27 patients, while 40 patients (SD+PD) were regarded as resistant to therapy.

Several molecular alterations involving different genes (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, BRAF, and HER2) seem to have a remarkable predilection for adenocarcinoma and specific inhibitors of EGFR and ALK are now available for patients with adenocarcinoma harboring the relevant gene alterations. The efficacy of histology-based and molecular-targeted therapies had a deep impact in (1) re-defining classification of lung cancer (particularly adenocarcinomas) and (2) routine clinical practice of pathologists involved in optimization of handling of tissue samples in order to guarantee NSCLC subtyping with the help of immunohistochemistry and adequately preserve tumor cells for molecular analysis.

Receptor activation via ligand binding leads to downstream signaling that influence cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Aberrant expression or activity of EGFR and HER2 have been strongly linked to the etiology of several human epithelial cancers including but not limited to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and breast cancer. With this, intense efforts have been made to inhibit the activity of the EGFR and HER2 by designing antibodies against the ligand binding domains (cetuximab, panitumumab and trastuzumab) or small molecules against the tyrosine kinase domains (erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib). Both approaches have shown considerable clinical promise. However, increasing evidence suggests that the majority of patients do not respond to these therapies, and those who show initial response ultimately become refractory to treatment. While mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been extensively studied, resistance to monoclonal antibodies is less well understood, both in the laboratory and in the clinical setting. In this review, we discuss resistance to antibody-based therapies against the EGFR and HER2, similarities between these resistance profiles, and strategies to overcome resistance to HER family targeting monoclonal antibody therapy.",

In our study, the growth inhibitory effects of cotreatment differed between mutant EGFR and wild type EGFR. A synergistic antiproliferative effect was observed in the combined treatments in H1975 and PC-9GR cells carrying T790M EGFR. In addition, the cotreatment exhibited a much greater inhibition than either agent alone on the following metastatic processes: (a) invasion, (b) wound healing, and (c) tubule formation by endothelial cells. The phosphorylations of EGFR family (EGFR, HER-2, and HER-3) and EGFR downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in H1975 and PC-9/GR cells were also attanuated, whereas EEF or gefitinib alone had no obvious effects. Similarly, the combination effectively suppressed tumor growth and increased mice survival in PC-9GR xenografts.

Afatinib resistant H1975 tumor clones expressed less PTEN than control clones and in afatinib resistant clones this correlated with increased basal SRC Y416, ERBB3 Y1289, AKT T308 and mTOR S2448 phosphorylation, decreased expression of ERBB1, ERBB2 and ERBB3 and increased total expression of c-MET, c-KIT and PDGFRβ.

Current treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, provide only limited improvement in the natural course of this disease. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic strategies is highly awaited. This review focuses on recent achievements on a novel class of anticancer drugs targeting the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor). The EGFR family is a group of four structurally similar growth factor receptors with tyrosine-kinase activity (EGFR, HER2/neu, ErbB-3, ErbB-4), which dimerize upon binding with a number of ligands, including EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) and TGF (Transforming Growth Factor), allowing downstream transduction of mitogenic signals. Overexpression of EGFR and HER2 is frequently found in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for over 80% of all malignant lung tumors, and has been associated with a worse clinical outcome. New agents developed to inhibit EGFR function include monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. In this review, results of most recent clinical with EGFR inhibitors including monoclonal antibodies, such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin), IMC-C225 (Cetuximab) and others (ABX-EGF, EMD 72000), and tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, such as ZD1839 (Gefitinib, Iressa), OSI-774 (Erlotinib, Tarceva) and others (CI-1033, GW2016), are summarized. In particular, final results of phase II (IDEAL 1 and 2) and III (INTACT 1 and 2) studies of ZD1839 are reported. In IDEAL trials (ZD1839 single agent in patients pre-treated with chemotherapy) there was clear evidence of tumor regression, symptoms improvement and overall clinical benefit, whereas in the two INTACT trials (ZD1839 in combination with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in chemo-naive patients) ZD1839 did not improve either survival or other clinical endpoints.

The effect of ectopic expression of MDGI on EGFR, ErbB2, and integrin function and traffic was investigated in breast and lung cancer cell lines using multiple methods. The effect of anti-EGFR agents on these cells were tested by cell proliferation measurements and by assessing tumor growth of breast cancer cells in cetuximab treated and control athymic nude mice.;Here, we show that although MDGI is absent in cultured cell lines because of epigenetic silencing, MDGI mRNA is expressed in 40% of clinical breast carcinomas and 85% of lung cancers. Ectopic expression of MDGI rendered breast and lung cancer cells resistant to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in vitro and in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. When expressed in cancer cells, MDGI induces intracellular accumulation of EGFR, but not ErbB2, and the internalized receptor is phosphorylated and not degraded.;MDGI-driven inherent desensitization of cancer cells is a novel molecular mechanism for resistance to the anti-EGFR antibody therapy, and MDGI may be a biomarker for responsiveness to anti-EGFR antibody therapy.",

However, the role of ErbB4 as a potential cancer drug target has remained controversial. Recently, somatic mutations altering the coding region of ErbB4 were described in patients with breast, gastric, colorectal, or non-small cell lung cancer, but the functional significance of these mutations is unknown. Here we demonstrate that 2 of 10 of the cancer-associated mutations of ErbB4 lead to loss of ErbB4 kinase activity due to disruption of functionally important structural features. Interestingly, the kinase-dead ErbB4 mutants were as efficient as wild-type ErbB4 in forming a heterodimeric neuregulin receptor with ErbB2 and promoting phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt in an ErbB2 kinase-dependent manner. However, the mutant ErbB4 receptors failed to phosphorylate STAT5 and suppressed differentiation of MDA-MB-468 mammary carcinoma cells.

Mutations of EGFR (mEGFR) and copy number gains (CNGs) of EGFR (gEGFR) and HER2 (gHER2) have been reported to predict for TKI response. Mutations in KRAS (mKRAS) are associated with primary resistance to TKIs.;We investigated the relationship between mutations, CNGs and response to TKIs in a large panel of NSCLC cell lines. Genes studied were EGFR, HER2, HER3 HER4, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. Mutations were detected by sequencing, while CNGs were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). IC50 values for the TKIs gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) were determined by MTS assay. For any of the seven genes tested, mutations (39/77, 50.6%), copy number gains (50/77, 64.9%) or either (65/77, 84.4%) were frequent in NSCLC lines. Mutations of EGFR (13%) and KRAS (24.7%) were frequent, while they were less frequent for the other genes. The three techniques for determining CNG were well correlated, and qPCR data were used for further analyses. CNGs were relatively frequent for EGFR and KRAS in adenocarcinomas. While mutations were largely mutually exclusive, CNGs were not. EGFR and KRAS mutant lines frequently demonstrated mutant allele specific imbalance i.e. the mutant form was usually in great excess compared to the wild type form. On a molar basis, sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib were highly correlated. Multivariate analyses led to the following results: 1. mEGFR and gEGFR and gHER2 were independent factors related to gefitinib sensitivity, in descending order of importance. 2. mKRAS was associated with increased in vitro resistance to gefitinib.;Our in vitro studies confirm and extend clinical observations and demonstrate the relative importance of both EGFR mutations and CNGs and HER2 CNGs in the sensitivity to TKIs.",

A missense mutation, L755P, in the HER2 kinase domain has been involved in lung cancer in humans and exhibits reduced response to lapatinib therapy. However, the detailed mechanism of how the HER2 L755P mutation causes drug resistance to lapatinib remains elusive. Here, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations [molecular mechanics and generalized Born/surface area (MM-GBSA)] were performed to reveal the mechanism of drug resistance due to the HER2 L755P mutation. MD simulations revealed that the L755P mutation caused structural changes in the regions of helix αC, the glycine-rich loop, and the activation loop, thereby leading to the loss of interactions between the solubilizing group of lapatinib and HER2. Moreover, MM-GBSA calculations suggested that hydrophobic interactions between lapatinib and HER2 contribute most to the binding affinity, and that the L755P mutation could result in a less energetically favorable HER2/lapatinib complex. This may weaken the binding of lapatinib to the mutated HER2, thereby leading to the emergence of drug resistance. This study offers a structural explanation for the effect of the L755P mutation on the HER2/lapatinib complex. ",

Clinical and pathological data, including sex, age at diagnosis, stage, tumor differentiation, smoking history, histological subtype, relapse-free and overall survival, were further analyzed.;In all, 16 NSCLC patients were found to harbor primary EGFR T790M mutation, including 14 adenocarcinomas and two adenosquamous carcinomas, accounting for 2.04% of all the EGFR mutant cases and 0.84% of the total. No c-MET amplification was found to coexist with primary EGFR T790M. Fewer EGFR copy-number variations were found in samples harboring EGFR T790M mutations compared with those in patients with exon 19 deletions and L858R. Overall survival was significantly shorter for patients harboring EGFR T790M mutation than it was for patients with exon 19 deletions (logrank P=0.008). When taking patients harboring EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletions as one group, the overall survival was also significantly longer than that in patients with T790M mutation (logrank P=0.012).

Activating alterations in a variety of potential oncogenic driver genes have also been identified in NSCLC, including ROS1, RET, MET, HER2, and BRAF.

The identification of these oncogenic drivers has led to the design of rationally targeted therapies that have produced superior clinical outcomes in tumours harbouring these mutations. Many patients, however, have de novo or acquired resistance to these therapies. In addition, most NSCLCs are genetically complex tumours harbouring multiple potential activating events. For these patients, disease subsets are likely to be defined by combination strategies involving a number of targeted agents. These targets include FGFR1, PTEN, MET, MEK, PD-1/PD-L1, and NaPi2b. In light of the myriad new biomarkers and targeted agents, multiplex testing strategies will be invaluable in identifying the appropriate patients for each therapy and enabling targeted agents to be channelled to the patients most likely to gain benefit.

Patients with activating mutations of the EGFR gene show sensitivity to, and clinical benefit from, treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKls). First generation reversible ATP-competitive EGFR-TKls, gefitinib and erlotinib, are effective as first, second-line or maintenance therapy. Despite initial benefit, most patients develop resistance within a year, 50-60% of cases being related to the appearance of a T790M gatekeeper mutation. Newer, irreversible EGFR-TKls - afatinib and dacomitinib - covalently bind to and inhibit multiple receptors in the ErbB family (EGFR, HER2 and HER4). These agents have been mainly evaluated for first-line treatment but also in the setting of acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKls. Afatinib is the first ErbB family blocker approved for patients with NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations; dacomitinib is in late stage clinical development. Mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors (AZD9291, CO-1686, HM61713) that specifically target the T790M resistance mutation are in early development. The EGFR-TKIs differ in their spectrum of target kinases, reversibility of binding to EGFR receptor, pharmacokinetics and potential for drug-drug interactions, as discussed in this review.

Targeted NGS was performed using a novel methodology that maximizes on-target reads, and minimizes artifact, and was validated on DNA dilutions derived from cell lines. Plasma NGS was then blindly performed on 48 patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC and a known tumor genotype, and explored in two patients with incomplete tumor genotyping.;NGS could identify mutations present in DNA dilutions at ≥ 0.4% allelic frequency with 100% sensitivity/specificity.

Sensitivity was 77% across 62 known driver and resistance mutations from the 48 cases; in 29 cases with common EGFR and KRAS mutations, sensitivity was similar to droplet digital PCR. In two cases with incomplete tumor genotyping, plasma NGS rapidly identified a novel EGFR exon 19 deletion and a missed case of MET amplification.;Blinded to tumor genotype, this plasma NGS approach detected a broad range of targetable genomic alterations in NSCLC with no false positives including complex mutations like rearrangements and unexpected resistance mutations such as EGFR C797S.

The purpose of this study was to clarify in the role of MET activation in lung carcinogenesis.;MET gene copy number was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 187 of the patients with lung cancer and the MET gene splice mutation deleting the juxtamembrane domain was examined by direct sequencing in 262.

However, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs could affect long-term outcome in almost all patients. To identify the potential mechanisms of resistance, we established cell lines resistant to EGFR-TKIs from the human lung cancer cell lines PC9 and11-18, which harbored activating EGFR mutations. One erlotinib-resistant cell line from PC9 and two erlotinib-resistant cell lines and two gefitinib-resistant cell lines from 11-18 were independently established. Almost complete loss of mutant delE746-A750 EGFR gene was observed in the erlotinib-resistant cells isolated from PC9, and partial loss of the mutant L858R EGFR gene copy was specifically observed in the erlotinib- and gefitinib-resistant cells from 11-18. However, constitutive activation of EGFR downstream signaling, PI3K/Akt, was observed even after loss of the mutated EGFR gene in all resistant cell lines even in the presence of the drug. In the erlotinib-resistant cells from PC9, constitutive PI3K/Akt activation was effectively inhibited by lapatinib (a dual TKI of EGFR and HER2) or BIBW2992 (pan-TKI of EGFR family proteins). Furthermore, erlotinib with either HER2 or HER3 knockdown by their cognate siRNAs also inhibited PI3K/Akt activation. Transfection of activating mutant EGFR complementary DNA restored drug sensitivity in the erlotinib-resistant cell line. Our study indicates that loss of addiction to mutant EGFR resulted in gain of addiction to both HER2/HER3 and PI3K/Akt signaling to acquire EGFR-TKI resistance.",

Here we find that in mesenchymal-like tumor cells both tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 signaling networks and expression of EGFR family ligands were decreased. While chronic activation of EGFR can promote an EMT-like transition, once having occurred EGFR family signaling was attenuated. We investigated the mechanisms by which mesenchymal-like cells bypass EGFR signaling and acquire alternative routes of proliferative and survival signaling. Mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells exhibit aberrant PDGFR and FGFR expression and autocrine signaling through these receptors can activate the MEK-ERK and PI3K pathways. Selective pharmacological inhibition of PDGFR or FGFR receptor tyrosine kinases reduced cell proliferation in mesenchymal-like but not epithelial NSCLC cell lines. A metastable, reversible EMT-like transition in the NSCLC line H358 was achieved by exogenous TGFbeta, which served as a model EMT system. The H358/TGFbeta cells showed many of the attributes of established mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells including a loss of cell-cell junctions, a loss of EGF-family ligand expression, a loss of ErbB3 expression, increased EGFR-independent Mek-Erk pathway activation and reduced sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Notably an EMT-dependent acquisition of PDGFR, FGFR and TGFbeta receptors in H358/TGFbeta cells was also observed. In H358/TGFbeta cells both PDGFR and FGFR showed functional ligand stimulation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities. The findings of kinase switching and acquired PDGFR and FGFR signaling suggest investigation of new inhibitor combinations to target NSCLC metastases.",

Tumors showing acinar, lepidic, micropapillary, or papillary growth in glandular component were classified as classical AdSqLC.;Of the 76 AdSqLCs, 43 (56.6%) harbored known mutant kinases, including 24 (31.6%) with EGFR mutations, eight (10.5%) with KRAS mutations, two (2.6%) with AKT1 (2.6%) mutations, one (1.3%) with ERBB2 insertion mutation, one (1.3%) with PIK3CA mutation, four (5.3%) with ALK fusions, and three (4%) with KIF5B-RET fusions. No mutation was found in BRAF. The mutational profiles and clinicopathologic characteristics of classical AdSqLC were strikingly similar to that of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. However, AdSqLCs with solid growth pattern in glandular component had high frequency of ALK or RET fusions and low EGFR mutation rate.;To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study investigating major oncogenic driver mutations in a large cohort of AdSqLC patients in a Chinese population.

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung [HGNECs, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)].;Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

This study aimed to establish the recommended dosing of the erlotinib and pertuzumab combination; assess safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics; and analyze biomarkers.;Fifteen patients with stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer who failed chemotherapy were recruited. The patients received erlotinib (days -8 to -1), then combination therapy (21-day cycles for 6 cycles). Pertuzumab was given intravenous at 840 mg, then 420 mg once every three weeks, with erlotinib given daily (100 or 150 mg).;No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Adverse events were generally grade 1/2 and manageable. The objective response rate was 20% (3/15 patients; 2 responders had mutant HER1, 1 responder had wild-type HER1), median overall progression-free survival was 9.3 weeks. High HER1, HER2, and HER3 messenger RNA expression correlated with increased progression-free survival. Combination therapy did not affect erlotinib's pharmacokinetics; however, pertuzumab mean exposures (maximum concentration, 231 mg/L; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 21 days, 1780 mg*d/L) were slightly higher than in previous studies.;Combination therapy was well tolerated in patients with good performance status, with encouraging efficacy. A loading dose of pertuzumab 840 mg followed by 420 mg once every three weeks plus daily erlotinib 150 mg appears to be the most appropriate regimen for this combination.",

TCGA provides 'Level 3' data, which have been processed using a pipeline specific to that resource. However, we have found using experimentally derived data that this pipeline produces gene-expression values that vary considerably across biological replicates. In addition, some RNA-Sequencing analysis tools require integer-based read counts, which are not provided with the Level 3 data. As an alternative, we have reprocessed the data for 9264 tumor and 741 normal samples across 24 cancer types using the Rsubread package. We have also collated corresponding clinical data for these samples. We provide these data as a community resource.;We compared TCGA samples processed using either pipeline and found that the Rsubread pipeline produced fewer zero-expression genes and more consistent expression levels across replicate samples than the TCGA pipeline. Additionally, we used a genomic-signature approach to estimate HER2 (ERBB2) activation status for 662 breast-tumor samples and found that the Rsubread data resulted in stronger predictions of HER2 pathway activity. Finally, we used data from both pipelines to classify 575 lung cancer samples based on histological type. This analysis identified various non-coding RNA that may influence lung-cancer histology.;The RNA-Sequencing and clinical data can be downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE62944).

Several inhibitors that act on Hsp90 by binding to its N-terminal ATP pocket have entered clinical evaluation. Robust pre-clinical data suggested anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer types. Clinically, encouraging results have been demonstrated in melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, castrate refractory prostate cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma and multiple myeloma. In breast cancer, proof-of-concept was demonstrated by first generation Hsp90 inhibitors in combination with trastuzumab mainly in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+metastatic breast cancer. There are a multitude of second generation Hsp90 inhibitors currently under investigation. To date, however, there is no FDA approved Hsp90 inhibitor nor standardized assay to ascertain Hsp90 inhibition. This review summarizes the current status of both first and second generation Hsp90 inhibitors based on their chemical classification and stage of clinical development. It also discusses the pharmacodynamic assays currently implemented in clinic as well as other novel strategies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibitors.

There is a growing body of evidence showing that cooperation between them contributes to a more aggressive tumor phenotype and impacts on their response to targeted therapy. We explored immunohistochemical co-expression of HER family receptors (HER1, HER2, HER3, HER4) and its potential role as prognostic factor in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Expression of HER family receptors was assessed by immunohistochemistry on 125 surgically resected NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to recurrence were calculated for clinical variables and HER expression, using the Cox model for multivariate analysis. HER1 and HER3 expression was detected more frequently in squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.002 and p = <0.001, respectively). HER4 was more often expressed in patients older than 60 years (p = 0.02) and in tumors of low histological grade (p = 0.04). Cases which expressed only HER1 had a worse DFS (p = 0.01) and OS (p = 0.01) compared to cases expressing HER1 and one or more of the other family members and to cases which did not express HER1 but one of the other HERs. By multivariate analysis, stage was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS. Furthermore, different patterns of co-expression of HER family receptors showed a statistically significant correlation with a shorter DFS (p = 0.03) and OS (p = 0.02). Our findings suggest that expression of HER1 only is correlated with worse DFS and OS. A better understanding of the functional relationships between these receptors may lead to a useful predictive indicator of response to targeted therapy.",

Some recurrent tumors have a common secondary mutation in the EGFR kinase domain, T790M, conferring drug resistance, but in other cases the mechanism underlying acquired resistance is unknown. In studying multiple sites of recurrent NSCLCs, we detected T790M in only a small percentage of tumor cells. To identify additional mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib, we used NSCLC cells harboring an activating EGFR mutation to generate multiple resistant clones in vitro. These drug-resistant cells demonstrate continued dependence on EGFR and ERBB2 signaling for their viability and have not acquired secondary EGFR mutations. However, they display increased internalization of ligand-activated EGFR, consistent with altered receptor trafficking. Although gefitinib-resistant clones are cross-resistant to related anilinoquinazolines, they demonstrate sensitivity to a class of irreversible inhibitors of EGFR. These inhibitors also show effective inhibition of signaling by T790M-mutant EGFR and killing of NSCLC cells with the T790M mutation. Both mechanisms of gefitinib resistance are therefore circumvented by irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our findings suggest that one of these, HKI-272, may prove highly effective in the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs, including tumors that have become resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib.",

In these patients, there is often an initial dramatic response to treatment with the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib or gefitinib. A small number of patients with EGFR mutations have primary resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib, and most patients who initially respond to treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib will develop resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs. The problems with both primary and acquired resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib support the need for development of additional agents that inhibit EGFR signaling in such patients. This is an overview of three representative second-generation EGFR TKIs. HKI-272, a second-generation irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2, has completed accrual of a phase II trial in both untreated patients and patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib. XL647 is a reversible inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and vascular epidermal growth factor receptor. Preclinical work shows that XL647 can inhibit cell lines bearing mutated forms of EGFR that have been associated with acquired resistance. BIBW2992 is an irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2 and vascular epidermal growth factor receptors. In vitro work shows that this compound inhibits wild-type EGFR, EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R, and EGFR T790M, the mutation associated with acquired resistance.

In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment of different human breast cancer cell lines with honokiol resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent growth inhibition in both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cell lines, as well as in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines such as adriamycin-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. The inhibition of growth was associated with a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. The effects of honokiol might be reversely related to the expression level of human epidermal growth receptor 2, (HER-2, also known as erbB2, c-erbB2) since knockdown of her-2 expression by siRNA significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the her-2 over-expressed BT-474 cells to the honokiol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of HER-2 signalling by specific human epidermal growth receptor 1/HER-2 (EGFR/HER-2) kinase inhibitor lapatinib synergistically enhanced the anti-cancer effects of honokiol in her-2 over-expressed breast cancer cells. Finally, we showed that honokiol was able to attenuate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and upregulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten) expression. Combination of honokiol with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin presented synergistic effects on induction of apoptosis of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol, either alone or in combination with other therapeutics, could serve as a new, promising approach for breast cancer treatment.",

The schemes included clinically relevant biomarkers for metastatic colorectal (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, microsatellite instability) and non-small cell lung cancer (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, ERBB2), and they represent the first multigene/multicancer studies throughout Europe. In total, 56 laboratories coordinated by 28 regional molecular centers participated in the schemes. Laboratories received formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and were asked to use routine methods for molecular testing to predict patient response to targeted therapies. They were encouraged to return results within 14 calendar days after sample receipt. Both genotyping and reporting were evaluated separately. During the three external quality assessment rounds, mean genotype scores were all above the preset standard of 90% for all biomarkers. Participants were mainly challenged in case of rare insertions or deletions. Assessment of the written reports showed substantial progress between the external quality assessment schemes on multiple criteria.

Each patient completed a detailed questionnaire about risk factor exposure. Biomarker and pathological analyses were also collected. We report the main descriptive overall results with a focus on sex differences. 384 patients were included: 65 men and 319 women. 66% had been exposed to passive smoking (significantly higher among women). Definite exposure to main occupational carcinogens was significantly higher in men (35% versus 8% in women). A targetable molecular alteration was found in 73% of patients (without any significant sex difference): EGFR in 51%, ALK in 8%, KRAS in 6%, HER2 in 3%, BRAF in 3%, PI3KCA in less than 1%, and multiple in 2%. We present the largest and most comprehensive LCINS analysis in a European population.

In this era of personalized therapy, there is a critical need to uncover the signaling architecture of brain metastases; however, little is known about what signaling pathways are activated in the context of the brain microenvironment. Using a unique study set of 42 brain metastases from patients with breast or nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the phosphorylation/activation states of 128 key signaling proteins involved in cancer signaling were measured in laser capture microdissected tumor epithelium using reverse phase protein microarray (RPMA) technology. Distinct pathway activation subgroups from both breast and lung metastases were underpinned by, among others, ERBB2, AKT, mTOR, EGFR, SMAD, and ERK-p38 signaling. Breast cancer metastases showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher activation of the c-ERBB2/IGFR-AKT pathway network compared to NSCLC metastases, whereas NSCLC metastases to the brain exhibited higher relative levels of many members of the EGFR-ERK signaling network. Protein pathway activation mapping using RPMA revealed both the heterogeneity of signaling networks in brain metastases that would require a prior stratification to targeted therapies as well as the requirement of direct analysis of the metastatic lesion.",

Treatment of human cancer cells with JNJ-28871063 inhibited phosphorylation of functionally important tyrosine residues in both EGFR and ErbB2 and blocked downstream signal transduction pathways responsible for proliferation and survival. A single dose of compound reduced phosphorylation of ErbB2 receptors in tumor-bearing mice, demonstrating target suppression in vivo.

In this study, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of a therapeutic anti-ErbB3 antibody, MM-121. We found that MM-121 effectively blocked ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3 induced by either EGFR, HER2, or MET. Assessment of several cancer cell lines revealed that MM-121 reduced basal ErbB3 phosphorylation most effectively in cancers possessing ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. In those cancers, MM-121 treatment led to decreased ErbB3 phosphorylation and, in some instances, decreased ErbB3 expression. The efficacy of single-agent MM-121 was also examined in xenograft models. A machine learning algorithm found that MM-121 was most effective against xenografts with evidence of ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. We subsequently investigated whether MM-121 treatment could abrogate resistance to anti-EGFR therapies by preventing reactivation of ErbB3. We observed that an EGFR mutant lung cancer cell line (HCC827), made resistant to gefitinib by exogenous heregulin, was resensitized by MM-121. In addition, we found that a de novo lung cancer mouse model induced by EGFR T790M-L858R rapidly became resistant to cetuximab. Resistance was associated with an increase in heregulin expression and ErbB3 activation. However, concomitant cetuximab treatment with MM-121 blocked reactivation of ErbB3 and resulted in a sustained and durable response. Thus, these results suggest that targeting ErbB3 with MM-121 can be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancers with ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3.",

We evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER-2/neu, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, p53 and bcl-2 expression and microvessel density (MVD) in patients who underwent surgery with curative intent in our department between 1991 and 1996. Co-expression of EGFR/MMP-9, MVD and bcl-2 were found to be independent prognostic variables, which allowed prediction of patient outcome independent of surgical stage. Other prognostic factors identified in our series were gender, surgical stage, platelet count, extent of necrosis, the hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase-9 and beta-catenin. In collaboration with groups in Oxford and Greece, we were also able to establish the angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor as prognostic variables. The inter-relationships between these factors are currently being examined in an expanded patient series.

The cellular effects of gefitinib on cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry and the molecular effects of gefitinib EGFR inhibition on downstream signal proteins by Western blotting. Gefitinib in vivo effects were evaluated in athymic nude mice bearing sensitive and resistant NSCLC xenografts.;There was a significant correlation between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR gene mutations, and gefitinib sensitivity.

Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-β3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index case, and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing the fusion (P < 0.0001). Ectopic expression of CD74-NRG1 in lung cancer cell lines expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3 activated ERBB3 and the PI3K-AKT pathway, and led to increased colony formation in soft agar.

Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been designed to specifically antagonize the function of the HER2 receptor in HER2-positive tumors. Clinical phase II and III trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the humanized anti-HER2 MAb, trastuzumab (Herceptin), both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients. However, the prevalence of HER2 overexpression/amplification in various tumor types raises the possibility of using anti-HER2 MAbs to antagonize the abnormal function of overexpressed HER2 receptors in HER2-positive tumors other than breast. Preliminary in vitro studies indicate that anti-HER2 MAbs suppress the proliferation of ovarian, gastric and NSCLC cell lines that overexpress the HER2 receptor.

It has long been understood that metastasis is a hallmark of malignancy, and conceptual theories on the basis of metastasis from the nineteenth century foretold the existence of a tumour \"seed\" which is capable of establishing discrete tumours in the \"soil\" of distant organs. This prescient \"seed and soil\" hypothesis accurately predicted the existence of CTCs; microscopic tumour fragments in the blood, at least some of which are capable of forming metastases. However, it is only in recent years that reliable, reproducible methods of CTC detection and analysis have been developed. To date, the majority of studies have employed the CellSearch™ system (Veridex LLC), which is an immunomagnetic purification method. Other promising techniques include microfluidic filters, isolation of tumour cells by size using microporous polycarbonate filters and flow cytometry-based approaches. While many challenges still exist, the detection of CTCs in blood is becoming increasingly feasible, giving rise to some tantalizing questions about the use of CTCs as a potential biomarker. CTC enumeration has been used to guide prognosis in patients with metastatic disease, and to act as a surrogate marker for disease response during therapy. Other possible uses for CTC detection include prognostication in early stage patients, identifying patients requiring adjuvant therapy, or in surveillance, for the detection of relapsing disease. Another exciting possible use for CTC detection assays is the molecular and genetic characterization of CTCs to act as a \"liquid biopsy\" representative of the primary tumour. Indeed it has already been demonstrated that it is possible to detect HER2, KRAS and EGFR mutation status in breast, colon and lung cancer CTCs respectively. In the course of this review, we shall discuss the biology of CTCs and their role in metastagenesis, the most commonly used techniques for their detection and the evidence to date of their clinical utility, with particular reference to lung cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease caused by genomic aberrations and characterized by significant variability in clinical outcomes and response to therapies. Several subtypes of common cancers have been identified based on alterations of individual cancer genes, such as HER2, EGFR, and others. However, cancer is a complex disease driven by the interaction of multiple genes, so the copy number status of individual genes is not sufficient to define cancer subtypes and predict responses to treatments. A classification based on genome-wide copy number patterns would be better suited for this purpose.;To develop a more comprehensive cancer taxonomy based on genome-wide patterns of copy number abnormalities, we designed an unsupervised classification algorithm that identifies genomic subgroups of tumors. This algorithm is based on a modified genomic Non-negative Matrix Factorization (gNMF) algorithm and includes several additional components, namely a pilot hierarchical clustering procedure to determine the number of clusters, a multiple random initiation scheme, a new stop criterion for the core gNMF, as well as a 10-fold cross-validation stability test for quality assessment.;We applied our algorithm to identify genomic subgroups of three major cancer types: non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and malignant melanoma. High-density SNP array datasets for patient tumors and established cell lines were used to define genomic subclasses of the diseases and identify cell lines representative of each genomic subtype. The algorithm was compared with several traditional clustering methods and showed improved performance. To validate our genomic taxonomy of NSCLC, we correlated the genomic classification with disease outcomes. Overall survival time and time to recurrence were shown to differ significantly between the genomic subtypes.;We developed an algorithm for cancer classification based on genome-wide patterns of copy number aberrations and demonstrated its superiority to existing clustering methods. The algorithm was applied to define genomic subgroups of three cancer types and identify cell lines representative of these subgroups. Our data enabled the assembly of representative cell line panels for testing drug candidates.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive role of IGF-1R expression in the response to EGFR-TKIs of NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations.;We retrospectively studied 62 NSCLC patients who had activating EGFR mutations and received TKIs.

The relationship of progression-free survival (PFS) with IGF-1R expression and the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) were examined.;Of 62 EGFR mutation positive patients, 26 expressed IGF-1R, and 13 had DM. In the multivariate analysis, young age, squamous cell carcinoma, and IGF-1R expression were independently associated with a shorter PFS after treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Patients expressing IGF-1R showed a significantly shorter PFS in response to EGFR-TKIs compared with those lacking IGF-1R expression (9.1 vs. 20.1 months, p=0.005). The 13 patients with DM were more likely to express IGF-1R (p=0.001) and had shorter PFS times when treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs (7.6 vs. 18.6 months, p=0.005), compared with those without DM.;IGF-1R expression was a negative predictive factor for a response to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations. Moreover, patients with DM highly expressed IGF-1R in tumor tissues, which was associated with a poor response to first-line TKI therapy.

We analyzed 27 practicable samples using a tumor genotyping panel to assess 23 hot-spot sites of genetic alterations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2), gene copy number of EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2, and ALK, ROS1, and RET fusions.

Twenty-seven samples were analyzed using our tumor genotyping panel, and 34 samples were analyzed for EGFR mutations only by commercial clinical laboratories. Twenty-one patients (34 %) had EGFR T790M mutation. Using our tumor genotyping panel, MET gene copy number gain was observed in two of 27 (7 %) samples. Twenty patients received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs even after disease progression, and 11 of these patients had T790M mutation in rebiopsy samples. In contrast, only 10 of 41 patients who finished EGFR-TKI treatment at disease progression had T790M mutation.

Moreover, biological information with putative clinical relevance was revealed as potentially novel diagnostic genes for each subtype with specificity 93-100% (AUC = 0.93-1.00). Cancer subtypes were characterized by (a) differential expression of treatment target genes as TYMS, HER2, and HER3 and (b) overrepresentation of treatment-related pathways like cell cycle, DNA repair, and ERBB pathways. The vascular smooth muscle contraction, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, and actin cytoskeleton pathways were overexpressed in normal tissue.;Reanalysis of this public dataset displayed the known biological features of lung cancer subtypes and revealed novel pathways of potentially clinical importance.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules was greater in HBECs expressing the mutant EGFRs than in cells expressing WT EGFR or mutant KRAS.

Phosphorylation of some proteins differed in the two EGFR mutant-expressing cells; for example, some cell junction proteins (beta-catenin, plakoglobin, and E-cadherin) were more phosphorylated in HBECs expressing L858R EGFR than in cells expressing Del EGFR. There were also differences in degree of phosphorylation at individual tyrosine sites within a protein; for example, a previously uncharacterized phosphorylation site in the nucleotide-binding loop of the kinase domains of EGFR (Y727), ERBB2 (Y735), or ERBB4 (Y733), is phosphorylated significantly more in HBECs expressing the deletion mutant than in cells expressing the wild type or L858R EGFR.

Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including AXL, are involved in the progression of NSCLC. The AXL/MER/SKY subfamily is involved in cell adhesion, motility, angiogenesis, and signal transduction and may play a significant role in the invasiveness of cancer cells. Notably, no specific inhibitors of AXL have been described. A series of CL1 sublines with progressive invasiveness established from a patient with NSCLC has been identified that positively correlates with AXL expression and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The ectopic overexpression of AXL results in elevated cell invasiveness and drug resistance. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling activity is associated with AXL expression and may play an important role in the enhancement of invasiveness and doxorubicin resistance, as shown by using the NF-kappaB inhibitor, sulfasalazine, and IkappaB dominant-negative transfectants. In the current study, sulfasalazine exerted a synergistic anticancer effect with doxorubicin and suppressed cancer cell invasiveness in parallel in CL1 sublines and various AXL-expressing cancer cell lines. Phosphorylation of AXL and other RTKs (ErbB2 and epidermal growth factor receptor) was abolished by sulfasalazine within 15 min, suggesting that the inhibition of NF-kappaB and the kinase activity of RTKs are involved in the pharmacologic effects of sulfasalazine.

Synergistic interaction was observed in 2D and in 3D cultures conditions, both in fully epithelial cells expressing all ErbB receptors, and in cells that had undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition and expressed low levels of ErbB3. We provided evidences suggesting that differential modulation of ErbB receptors by vorinostat or VPA, also at low doses corresponding to plasma levels easily reached in treated patients, is responsible for the observed synergism. In details, we showed in epithelial cells that both vorinostat and VPA induced time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of all three ErbB receptors and of downstream signaling. On the contrary, in A3-resistant mesenchymal cells, we observed time- and dose-dependent increase of mRNA and protein levels as well as surface expression of ErbB3, paralleled by down-regulation of EGFR and ErbB2. Our results suggest that the combination of a HDACi plus an anti-ErbB3 MoAb represents a viable strategy that warrants further evaluation for the treatment of NSCLC patients. ",

Of 44 articles initially selected, 20 articles fulfilled eligibility criteria. DerSimonian-Laird random effects analysis was used to estimate the effects of HER-2 overexpression on survival differences (the survival rate among patients without HER-2 overexpression minus the survival rate among patients with HER-2 overexpression) at endpoints of 1 years, 3 years, and 5 years after resection of NSCLC.;In total, 2579 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall, HER-2 positivity differed according to histologic type and included 38% of patients with adenocarcinoma, 16% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and 18% of patients with large cell carcinoma (P < 0.0001). The combined survival differences in patients with NSCLC at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively, were 2.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.3-6.7%; P = 0.1787), 15.2% (95% CI, 5.8-24.5%; P = 0.0015), and 16.4% (95% CI, 7.9-14.8%; P = 0.0001), suggesting significant poorer survival at 3 years and 5 years among patients with HER-2 overexpression. In patients with adenocarcinoma, the combined survival difference at 5 years was 26.0% (95% CI, 16.0-36.1%; P < 0.0001), suggesting a particularly strong survival impact for HER-2 overexpression.;A significant, unfavorable prognostic effect of HER-2 overexpression in NSCLC was evident from the metaanalysis.

Tedious experiments are often required to determine which tumor types have amplifications of a specific oncogene. To facilitate rapid screening for molecular alterations in many different malignancies, a tissue microarray consisting of samples from 17 different tumor types was generated. Altogether, 397 individual tumors were arrayed in a single paraffin block. To determine whether results from the literature can be reproduced on minute tissue samples (diameter, 0.6 mm), amplification of three extensively studied oncogenes (CCND1, CMYC, and ERBB2) was analyzed in three fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments from consecutive sections cut from the tissue microarray. Amplification of CCND1 was found in breast, lung, head and neck, and bladder cancer, as well as in melanoma. ERBB2 was amplified in bladder, breast, colon, stomach, testis, and lung cancer. CMYC was amplified in breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovary, bladder, head and neck, and endometrial cancer. These results confirm and even extend existing data in the literature on such amplifications. In summary, we applied three fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments to analyze amplifications of three oncogenes in three x 397 tumors within a week.

However, the potential mechanisms of TOB1 are still debated. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of infrared (IR) radiation on TOB1 expression in the human lung cancer cell lines NCI-H1975 and A549 via western blot analysis. NCI-H1975 cells were transfected with TOB1 recombinant plasmid, and A549 cells were treated with TOB1-small interfering RNA (siRNA) to establish gain-of-function and loss-of‑function cell models. The effects of radiation and TOB1 overexpression and silencing on clonogenic survival, cell cycle distribution and DNA repair were assessed. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the related mechanisms. The expression levels of TOB1 were significantly induced by IR radiation. Overexpression of TOB1 abrogated radiation-induced G2/M arrest, reduced clonogenic cell survival and enhanced γ-H2AX foci in NCI-H1975 cells exposed to irradiation. TOB1-siRNA demonstrated opposite effects in A549 cells. TOB1 regulated the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and modulated the phosphorylation of p53 via activation of the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.

Overexpression of HER2 and deregulation of signaling has implications in breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. We have designed several peptidomimetics to block the HER2-mediated dimerization, resulting in antiproliferative activity for cancer cells. In this work, we have investigated the structure-activity relationships of peptidomimetic analogs of Compound 5. Compound 5 was conformationally constrained by N- and C-terminal modification and cyclization as well as by substitution with d-amino acids at the N-and C-termini. Among the compounds studied in this work, a peptidomimetic Compound 21 with d-amino acid substitution and its N- and C-termini capped with acetyl and amide functional groups and a reversed sequence compared to that of Compound 5 exhibited better antiproliferative activity in HER2-overexpressed breast, ovarian, and lung cancer cell lines. Compound 21 was further evaluated for its protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibition ability using enzyme fragment complementation assay, proximity ligation assay, and Western blot analysis. Results suggested that Compound 21 is able to block HER2:HER3 interaction and inhibit phosphorylation of the kinase domain of HER2. The mode of binding of Compound 21 to HER2 protein was modeled using a docking method. Compound 21 seems to bind to domain IV of HER2 near the PPI site of EGFR:HER2, and HER:HER3 and inhibit PPI.",

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor suppression by Rb are largely unknown. The neu gene is a dominant transforming oncogene and a member of the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase gene family. Both inactivation of the Rb gene and overexpression of the neu gene are involved in human breast and lung cancers. Therefore, it is of interest and importance to investigate the potential interactions between Rb and neu. Here we show that Rb suppresses neu-induced transformation by focus formation assays. This transformation suppression by Rb was further shown to be due to transcriptional repression of neu using Rb expressing effector plasmid and neu promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The cis-acting element conferring Rb-mediated repression was mapped to a recently identified novel enhancer in the neu promoter. The data indicate that the growth factor receptor neu is a target for the Rb gene product and transcriptional repression of a dominant oncogene expression may be one of the molecular mechanisms of Rb-mediated tumor suppression.",

Inhibitors targeting them are vigorously developed and some of them are tested in the clinical setting. Amplifications of certain RTKs (c-Met, FGFR2 and ErbB2) have been associated with human gastric cancer progression. According to our genome-wide scans of genetic lesions in 34 gastric cancer cell lines using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping microarrays, we confirmed that the c-met locus was amplified in four gastric cancer cell lines (Hs746T, MKN45, NUGC4 and SNU5). It was reported that somatic mutation is occasionally detected in tumor samples of a certain type of cancer with gene amplification. Previous reports showed gastric cancers harbored mutations of FGFR2 and ErbB2, but c-Met oncogenic mutation had not yet been reported. We performed mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domains of c-Met using the genome DNA of the gastric cancer cell lines, and found that Hs746T cells had a splice site mutation of exon 14. By cDNA sequencing and Western blotting, we showed that the mutation caused juxtamembrane domain deletion. Previously, this mutation had been detected only in lung cancer specimens and this deletion resulted in the loss of Cbl E3-ligase binding causing decreased ubiquitination and delayed down-regulation. In conclusion, four gastric cancer cell lines harbored amplification of c-met locus, and among them, Hs746T had a putative oncogenic mutation with amplification. This information will be useful for screening of inhibitors targeting gastric cancer with c-Met aberration.",

Nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) overexpresses HER-2 protein in approximately 20% of cases. In the current study, the authors combined trastuzumab with weekly taxanes in an attempt to improve outcomes over standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.;The primary objective was to determine whether docetaxel plus trastuzumab or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was the superior regimen based on response and toxicity, and to determine whether either regimen was appropriate for further testing in a randomized Phase III trial. After stratification based on the results of HER-2 immunohistochemistry, chemotherapy-naive patients were randomized to receive trastuzumab plus docetaxel or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel. The study was designed so patients with or without HER-2 overexpression would be distributed equally between the study arms.;Immunohistochemistry for HER-2 protein expression was attempted for 182 pathologic samples from 169 patients. Twenty-eight of the 179 evaluable samples (16%) revealed 2+ or 3+ staining. The objective response rate was 23% (7 of 30 patients) in the patients treated with docetaxel plus trastuzumab and 32% (11 of 34 patients) in the patients treated with paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (P=0.76, Wilcoxon test). No difference was noted in the median survival (16 mos vs. 14 mos) or 1-year survival (57% vs. 55%) (P=0.998). Toxicities were mild in both treatment arms. No difference with regard to response rates or survival was noted between HER-2-positive (2+ or 3+) and HER-2-negative (0-1+) patients.;The expression of HER-2 protein in patients with advanced NSCLC in this study was found to be similar to that reported in previous series. The response rates and toxicities for patients treated with docetaxel and trasuzumab or paclitaxel and trasuzumab were not significantly different, though survival in both arms was better than expected. HER-2 expression status did not appear to affect outcomes for this uniform group of patients who were treated in a comparable fashion.

Currently, only human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy has been successful in significantly prolonging the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC). There is a need for the discovery of additional novel targets in GC.;Anti-ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to screen 495 GC samples and was followed by simultaneous ROS1 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses in IHC-positive samples. Fusion partners in ROS1-rearranged GC were determined by RT-PCR. In all 495 samples, HER2 amplification was identified with FISH, and MET expression was identified by IHC.;Twenty-three tumor samples were ROS1 IHC-positive. Three of 23 patients were ROS1 FISH positive, HER2 FISH negative, and negative for MET overexpression; and 2 of those 3 patients harbored a solute carrier family 34 (sodium phosphate), member 2 (SLC34A2)-ROS1 fusion transcripts. No fusion partner was identified in the third patient. Both patients who had SLC34A2-ROS1 transcripts had poorly differentiated histology with recurrence and death within 2 years of curative surgery. ROS1 IHC-positive status was not identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.;In this study, an SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement was identified in GC, and the results provide a rationale for investigating the clinical efficacy of ROS1 inhibitors in this unique molecular subset of GC.

The expression of JUN, ERBB2, MYC, cyclin D, PCNA, bFGF, VEGF and Hsp70 proteins revealed a positive correlation to lymph node involvement. In contrast, caspase-3, Fas ligand, Fas/CD95, and PAI showed an inverse correlation to lymph node involvement. In a second step, these parameters were further analyzed by hierarchical cluster analyses. The resulting clusters were correlated to patients with or without lymph node involvement.

Over-expression of p185 can be detected immunologically by quantification of the extracellular domain of p185 (c-erbB-2 oncopeptide) in extracellular fluid in vitro and in serum in vivo. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the c-erbB-2 oncopeptide was used to examine banked serum samples of 11 pneumoconiosis patients who subsequently developed lung cancer and serum samples from 11 hospital controls matched for age, sex, ethnic group and smoking as well as 55 unmatched general population controls. The mean serum level for the c-erbB-2 oncopeptide in human neu units/ml in the lung cancer cases (1,756 +/- 549 HNU/ml) was statistically significantly elevated (p < 0.001) in comparison to the mean level in the matched controls (976 +/- 488 HNU/ml) or the general population controls (888 +/- 655 HNU/ml). Defining a positive elevation of the serum c-erbB-2 oncopeptide as any value more than 2 standard deviations above the mean of the matched controls, 64% (7 of 11) of the lung cancer cases were positive compared to 0% (0 of 11) matched controls and 5% (3 of 55) of the unmatched controls. In addition, 4 of the 7 c-erbB-2 oncopeptide-positive cancer cases had positive serum samples prior to the time of disease diagnosis (average = 35 months). These results suggest that serum c-erbB-2 oncopeptide may be elevated at an early stage of pulmonary carcinogenesis and that further prospective study of the utility of this biomarker is warranted.",

One larger MCR of gain contained NSD1. One focal amplification and nine gains contained FUS. NSD1 and FUS are oncogenes hitherto not known to be associated with lung cancer. FISH showed that the amplicon containing FUS was joined to the next telomeric amplicon at 16p11.2. FUS was over-expressed in 10 tumors with gain of 16p11.2 compared to 30 tumors without that gain. Other cancer genes present in aberrations included ARNT, BCL9, CDK4, CDKN2B, EGFR, ERBB2, MDM2, MDM4, MET, MYC and KRAS. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering with adjustment for false-discovery rate revealed clusters differing by the level and pattern of aberrations and displaying particular tumor characteristics. One cluster was strongly associated with gain of MYC. Another cluster was characterized by extensive losses containing tumor suppressor genes of which RB1 and WRN. Tumors in that cluster frequently harbored a central scar-like fibrosis. A third cluster was associated with gains on 7p and 7q, containing ETV1 and BRAF, and displayed the highest rate of EGFR mutations. SNP array analysis validated copy-number aberrations and revealed that RB1 and WRN were altered by recurrent copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity.;The present study has uncovered new aberrations containing cancer genes. The oncogene FUS is a candidate gene in the 16p region that is frequently gained in never smokers.

Pesticide risk (herbicide and insecticide) was assessed by telephone interviews using a predetermined questionnaire with emphasis on type of exposure, use of protective measures, and duration of exposure. An exposure index was calculated (h/day x days/year x years), and patients with an index > 2400 h were considered as exposed. HER-2/neu overexpression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the Hercep test developed by Dako. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-10.;A total of 193 patients (84 females and 109 males), with a mean age of 68.5 years (range, 42-90 years) were included in the study. Of these, 57 (29.5%) revealed HER-2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry. After adjusting for age, smoking, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, and treatment, HER-2/neu overexpression was associated with a statistically significant diminished survival (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test). We contacted 53 of 57 patients with overexpression and 121 of 136 patients without HER-2/neu overexpression to ascertain a history of pesticide exposure. Forty-one of 53 (77.4%) patients with HER-2/neu overexpression and 47 of the 121 patients without overexpression (38.8%) were exposed to pesticides. We found that patients with history of pesticide exposure had a higher risk of having HER-2/neu overexpression (odds ratio, 5.38; P < 0.01, 95% confidence interval, 2.5-11.2);HER-2/neu is overexpressed in approximately 30% patients with ESSCLC and is associated with decreased survival.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and to a less extent, HER-2/neu, are known to be overexpressed in non-small lung cancers, but their exact status in ABAF is not well-documented. Stimulation of these two receptors results in the initiation of two major cascades, namely phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) and Ras-dependent pathways. We have therefore studied the expressions of EGFR, HER-2/neu as well as phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and phosphorylated extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK), which are key molecules in these two pathways, in 15 ABAF patients. EGFR was found to be overexpressed in 9 of 15 patients (60%). HER-2/neu overexpression was detected in 6 of the 14 tumors tested (43%). pAKT and pERK were both found to be positive in 13 of 15 patients (87%). Six of the seven tumors with mucinous pattern were negative for EGFR, while all of the other eight cases were positive (P=0.001). Mucinous tumors were also less likely than non-mucinous tumors to overexpress HER-2/neu (17% versus 63%, respectively). These findings suggest that ABAF, particularly those with non-mucinous histology, commonly harbors EGFR and HER-2/neu overexpression. PI-3K and Ras-dependant pathways that lie downstream are generally activated, even in the absence of EGFR and/or HER-2/neu overexpression. ABAF may be a particularly promising candidate for EGFR-targeted strategies and this possibility merits extensive evaluation in clinical trials.",

The samples were collected between 1981 and 1987 from 111 asbestosis patients. X-ray pictures, taken three times during this period of time, were evaluated according to the ILO classification to deduce the severity of the disease (stable, unstable) and compared side by side to determine the progression of asbestosis. Follow-up of these patients until 1993 showed that 38 patients had developed cancer (27 lung, 3 pleural mesothelioma, 8 diverse malignancies). As determined by ELISA for EGFR and two different assays for Neu oncoprotein (Neu, nNeu) there was a statistically significant difference between EGFR levels in all the cancer and the non-lung cancer cases compared with the controls. No statistically significant differences were detected between Neu levels in the cancer cases and the controls. Protein concentrations showed no change prior the diagnosis of cancer. The serum levels of the proteins correlated with each other (EGFR-Neu, r=0.3; Neu-nNeu, r=0.7). Among 9 factors that were analyzed by multiple regression analysis progressive asbestosis was statistically significantly associated with the elevation of Neu and smoking with the elevation of nNeu. In logistic regression analysis only unstable asbestosis associated with cancer (OR = 6.25, p=0.0012). This study shows a coherence between the severity of asbestosis and development of cancer. Furthermore, the Neu concentration in the serum was elevated in both unstable and progressive asbestosis cases and may offer tools, supplementary to X-rays, for clinical monitoring of the pneumoconiosis patients.",

Massive parallel sequencing (MPS) has been suggested for routine diagnostics, but this technology has not been sufficiently evaluated with respect to feasibility, reliability, and cost effectiveness with routine diagnostic formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. We performed ultradeep targeted semiconductor-based MPS (190 amplicons covering hotspot mutations in 46 genes) in a variety of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diagnostic samples of lung adenocarcinoma tissue with known EGFR mutations (n = 28). The samples reflected the typical spectrum of tissue material for diagnostics, including small biopsies and samples with low tumor-cell content. Using MPS, we successfully sequenced all samples, with a mean read depth of 2947 reads per amplicon. High-quality sequence reads were obtained from samples containing ≥10% tumor material. In all but one sample, variant calling identified the same EGFR mutations as were detected by conventional Sanger sequencing. Moreover, we identified 43 additional mutations in 17 genes and detected amplifications in the EGFR and ERBB2 genes. MPS performance was reliable and independent of the type of material, as well as of the fixation and extraction methods, but was influenced by tumor-cell content and the degree of DNA degradation. Using sample multiplexing, focused MPS approached diagnostically acceptable cost rates. ",

Mutually exclusive somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (36/86, 41.8%), K-ras gene (11/86, 12.8%) and BRAF gene (1/86, 1.1%) were detected. KRAS mutations were observed significantly frequently in bronchial-type tumors, whereas the frequencies of EGFR mutations were similar in both the alveolar and bronchial types. Twenty-seven genes showed increased expression in EGFR-mutated tumors and these included molecules that function in the EGFR/KRAS/BRAF pathway (EGFR, AKT1 and BCR). In particular, expression of BCR, which is required for EGFR protein degradation, was induced by EGF stimulation, suggesting a negative feedback loop in lung cancer. A subgroup of the alveolar type tumors showed significantly better prognosis than other tumors.

In this article, the role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in detecting companion biomarkers is reviewed. The hormone receptor (HR) is a companion bi- omarker for hormonal therapy in breast cancers, and IHC is the standard assay for detecting HR expression. The overexpression/amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is predictive of a favorable response to anti-HER2 agents such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, and pertuzumab. IHC and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are used to determine the HER2 status. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations respond to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Recently, mutated EGFRs have been detected by IHC with mutation-specific antibodies, although it shows a lower sensitivity and specificity than DNA sequencing. In addition, NSCLCs with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene are highly responsive to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. Companion diagnostic assays for crizotinib are IHC, FISH, and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor a mutations, related to the effectiveness of imatinib. Thus, definite pathologic diagnosis using IHC is necessary for the appropriate treatment of GISTs. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, improves the treatment outcome for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the field, confirmation of CD20 expression by IHC is necessary for application of the drug.

This manuscript comprehensively reviews the preclinical data on afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) including EGFR, HER2 and ErbB4. Afatinib covalently binds to cysteine 797 of the EGFR and the corresponding cysteines 805 and 803 in HER2 and ErbB4, respectively. Such covalent binding irreversibly inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors, resulting in reduced auto- and transphosphorylation within the ErbB dimers and inhibition of important steps in the signal transduction of all ErbB receptor family members. Afatinib inhibits cellular growth and induces apoptosis in a wide range of cells representative for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer and several other cancer types exhibiting abnormalities of the ErbB network. This translates into tumour shrinkage in a variety of in vivo rodent models of such cancers. Afatinib retains inhibitory effects on signal transduction and in vitro and in vivo cancer cell growth in tumours resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors, such as those exhibiting the T790M mutations. Several combination treatments have been explored to prevent and/or overcome development of resistance to afatinib, the most promising being those with EGFR- or HER2-targeted antibodies, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors or inhibitors of downstream signalling molecules.

We profiled the mutation status of the PIK3Ca gene in the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-60 panel of human cancer cell lines maintained by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the NCI. Mutation hotspots on the gene were PCR amplified and sequenced, and the trace data were analyzed with software designed to detect mutations. Seven of the cell lines tested have PIK3Ca mutations: two lines derived from breast cancer, two from colon cancer, two from ovarian cancer, and one from lung cancer. BRAF and EGFR genes were normal in the PIK3Ca mutant lines. Two of the cell lines with mutant PIK3Ca also have a mutant version of the KRAS gene. The mutation status was correlated with array-based gene expression that is publicly available for the NCI-60 cell lines. We found increased expression levels for estrogen receptor (ER) and ERBB2 in PIK3Ca mutant lines. The PIK3Ca mutation status was also correlated with compound screening data for the cell lines. PIK3Ca-mutant cell lines were relatively more sensitive than PIK3Ca-normal cell lines to the ER inhibitor tamoxifen and the AKT inhibitor triciribine, among other compounds. The results provide insights into the role of mutant PIK3Ca in oncogenic signaling and allow preliminary identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in cancers harboring PIK3Ca mutations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ErbB3 receptors are unique members of the erbB receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are often aberrantly expressed and/or activated in human cancers. Unlike other members in the family, erbB3 lacks or has impaired kinase activity. To transduce cell signaling, erbB3 has to interact with other RTKs and to be phosphorylated by its interactive partners, of those, erbB2 is the most important one. ErbB3 is frequently co-expressed with other RTKs in cancer cells to activate oncogenic signaling, such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) pathway, etc. and thereby promote tumorigenesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that activation of erbB3 signaling plays an important role in the progression of a variety of tumor types, such as erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, platinum refractory/resistant ovarian cancer, epidermal growth factor receptor TKI-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer, and others. Basic research on the underlying mechanisms implicated the functions of erbB3 as a major cause of treatment failure in cancer therapy. Thus, concomitant inhibition of erbB3 is thought to be required to overcome the resistance and to effectively treat human cancers. This review focuses on the latest advances in our understanding of erbB3-initiated signaling in the development of resistance to cancer treatments.",

Tissue micro-arrays were constructed of ER+/PR±/HER2- (n = 37), ER-/PR-/HER2+ (n = 15), ER-/PR-/HER2- (n = 61) and ER+/PR+/HER2+ (n = 20) breast cancers; including 13 inflammatory breast carcinomas. FISH was performed using ALK break-apart and chromosome 2 centromere enumeration probes (CEP2). Neither ALK rearrangements nor amplification were identified in the 133 breast cancer cases evaluated. However, copy number gains (CNG) of ALK were identified in 82 of 133 patients (62 %). The CEP2 analysis revealed polysomy of chromosome 2 in all HCNG and LCNG cases, indicating the CNG of ALK are due to polysomy of chromosome 2, rather than true amplification of ALK. To conclude, we observed CNG of ALK secondary to chromosome 2 polysomy in a significant percentage of breast cancer cases, a phenomenon similar to polysomy 17.

HER2 protein is an attractive target for tumor-specific drug delivery because of its overexpression in multiple malignancies, including breast, gastric, ovarian, and lung cancers.;In this paper, we developed a new HER2 aptamer (HB5) by using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technology (SELEX) and exploited its role as a targeting ligand for delivering doxorubicin (Dox) to breast cancer cells in vitro.;The selected aptamer was an 86-nucleotide DNA molecule that bound to an epitope peptide of HER2 with a Kd of 18.9 nM. The aptamer also bound to the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2 protein with a Kdof 316 nM, and had minimal cross reactivity to albumin or trypsin. In addition, the aptamer was found to preferentially bind to HER2-positive but not HER2-negative breast cancer cells. An aptamer-doxorubicin complex (Apt-Dox) was formulated by intercalating Dox into the DNA structure of HB5. The Apt-Dox complex could selectively deliver Dox to HER2-positive breast cancer cells while reducing the drug intake by HER2-negative cells in vitro. Moreover, Apt-Dox retained the cytotoxicity of Dox against HER2-positive breast cancer cells, but reduced the cytotoxicity to HER2-negative cells.;The results suggest that the selected HER2 aptamer may have application potentials in targeted therapy against HER2-positive breast cancer cells.",

Clinical toxicities were also compared.;The survival benefit with CAB in advanced prostate cancer appears to be approximately 3 months. The survival benefit with the addition of vinorelbine to cisplatin for the treatment of advanced NSCLC is approximately 2 months, and the survival benefit with the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil (and leucovorin) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is approximately 2 to 3 months. The survival benefit with anastrozole or exemestane in advanced breast cancer, or with the addition of trastuzumab to standard chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is approximately 4 to 5 months. The calculated cost per month of survival benefit with bicalutamide in CAB for prostate cancer is 437 US dollars to 1107 US dollars. The cost per month of survival benefit with vinorelbine for NSCLC is 1241 US dollars and with irinotecan for colorectal cancer is 6812 to 11,214 US dollars. The calculated cost per month of survival benefit with anastrozole for breast cancer is 170 US dollars, for exemestane is 185 US dollars, and the cost per month with the addition of trastuzumab is 5230 US dollars.

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family consists of four members that belong to the ErbB lineage of proteins (ErbB1-4). These receptors consist of an extracellular domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and an intracellular portion with a juxtamembrane segment, a protein kinase domain, and a carboxyterminal tail. The ErbB proteins function as homo and heterodimers. Growth factor binding to EGFR induces a large conformational change in the extracellular domain. Two ligand-EGFR complexes unite to form a back-to-back dimer in which the ligands are on opposite sides of the aggregate. Following ligand binding, EGFR intracellular kinase domains form an asymmetric dimer. The carboxyterminal lobe of the activator kinase of the dimer interacts with the amino-terminal lobe of the receiver kinase thereby leading to its allosteric stimulation. Several malignancies are associated with the mutation or increased expression of members of the ErbB family including lung, breast, stomach, colorectal, head and neck, and pancreatic carcinomas. Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are orally effective protein-kinase targeted quinazoline derivatives that are used in the treatment of ERBB1-mutant lung cancer and lapatinib is an orally effective quinazoline derivative used in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies that target the extracellular domain of ErbB2 are used for the treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancer and monoclonal antibodies that target ErbB1 and are used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Cancers treated with these targeted drugs eventually become resistant to them, and a current goal of research is to develop drugs that are effective against drug-resistant tumors. ",

Further improvements of these therapies may be guided by a quantitative, dynamic integrative systems understanding of the complexities of ErbB dimerisation, trafficking and activation, for it is these complexities that render difficult intuiting how perturbations such as drug intervention will affect ErbB signalling activities. Towards this goal, we have developed a computational model implementing commonly accepted principles governing ErbB receptor interaction, trafficking, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Using this model, we are able to investigate several hypotheses regarding the compartmental localisation of dephosphorylation. Model results applied to experimental data on ErbB 1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 phosphorylation in H292 human lung carcinoma cells support a hypothesis that key dephosphorylation activity for these receptors occurs largely in an intracellular, endosomal compartment rather than at the cell surface plasma membrane. Thus, the endocytic trafficking-related compartmentalisation of dephosphorylation may define a critical aspect of the ErbB signalling response to ligand.",

Aberrant EGFR signaling is correlated with progression of various malignancies, and somatic tyrosine kinase domain mutations in the EGFR gene have been discovered in patients with non-small cell lung cancer responding to EGFR-targeting small molecular agents, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. EGFR overexpression is thought to be the principal mechanism of activation in various malignant tumors. Moreover, an increased EGFR copy number is associated with improved survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients, suggesting that increased expression of mutant and/or wild-type EGFR molecules could be molecular determinants of responses to gefitinib. However, as EGFR mutations and/or gene gains are not observed in all patients who respond partially to treatment, alternative mechanisms might confer sensitivity to EGFR-targeting agents. Preclinical studies showed that sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors depends on how closely cell survival and growth signalings are coupled with EGFR, and also with HER2 and HER3, in each cancer.

This marker is also considered a powerful prognostic factor in BC, with similar data emerging in other solid tumours such as bladder, ovarian, endometrial, gastro-oesophageal and non-small cell lung cancer. Her2 amplification and/or overexpression are highly predictive of response to HER2-targeted compounds such as trastuzumab and lapatinib but have been inconsistent predictors of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. There is also evidence that these tumours are relatively resistant to anti-oestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) but not to oestrogen deprivation (e.g. with aromatase inhibitors). T2A aberrations are uncommon events in solid tumours, with an overall prevalence of approximately 10%. T2A amplification has shown inconsistent correlation with T2A protein expression in preclinical and clinical studies, mainly because non-genetic events such as proliferation rate can also affect protein expression. Expression of T2A protein has not been shown to reliably predict response to T2A inhibitors, despite the fact that this enzyme is the direct target for these compounds. In BC, T2A amplification appears to be a good predictor of response to anthracyclines, but these data are still in the process of validation.

Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur at a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will concentrate on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will concentrate on gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift in the personalized treatment of GC patients where multiplex comprehensive screening of all GC patients for all these potential driver mutations simultaneously is performed to achieve efficiencies and timeliness in diagnosis and allowing enrollment into different molecularly targeted therapy trials and the prospective discovery of novel yet unknown actionable driver mutations.

Known EGFR inhibitors were exposed to distinct drug resistance against the various EGFR mutants within non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly the T790M mutation. Although so far a number of studies have been reported on the development of third-generation EGFR inhibitors for overcoming the resistance issue, the design procedure largely depends on the intuition of medicinal chemists. Here we retrospectively make a detailed analysis of the 42 EGFR family protein crystal complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Based on the analysis of inhibitor binding modes in the kinase catalytic cleft, we identified a potent EGFR inhibitor (compound A-10) against drug-resistant EGFR through fragment-based drug design. This compound showed at least 30-fold more potency against EGFR T790M than the two control molecules erlotinib and gefitinib in vitro. Moreover, it could exhibit potent HER2 inhibitory activities as well as tumor growth inhibitory activity. Molecular docking studies revealed a structural basis for the increased potency and mutant selectivity of this compound. Compound A-10 may be selected as a promising candidate in further preclinical studies. In addition, our findings could provide a powerful strategy to identify novel selective kinase inhibitors on the basis of detailed kinase-ligand interaction space in the PDB. ",

It is overexpressed in several human cancers of epithelial origin, such as pancreatic cancer. Previously, we demonstrated that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) derived from breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer recognized a peptide derived from HER2/neu. To evaluate whether this HLA-A2-binding peptide is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) in pancreatic cancer, the ability of HER2/neu-reactive CTL to lyse human pancreatic carcinoma cells was tested. CTL were generated from tumor-associated T lymphocytes from HLA-A2+ HER2/neu+ breast and ovarian cancer patients. All CTL recognized autologous and allogeneic HER2/ neu+ tumor cells in an HLA-A2-restricted fashion. Furthermore, all CTL recognized p654-662 (GP2) derived from HER2/neu. These CTL also recognized HER2/neu+ pancreatic cancer cells in an HLA-A2-restricted fashion. HER2/neu+ HLA-A2- pancreatic cancer were not or only poorly lysed. Repeated stimulation of HLA-A2+ PBL from pancreatic cancer patients using the HER2/neu-derived peptide resulted in specific recognition of this peptide and, more importantly, HER2/neu+ pancreatic tumors in an HLA-A2-restricted fashion. Autologous HLA-A2+ fibroblasts or HLA-A2+ malignant melanoma cells were not recognized. HLA-A2- peptide-stimulated T lymphocytes showed no significant cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that this HER2/neu-derived peptide is a shared TAA among several adenocarcinomas including pancreatic carcinoma, suggesting a common mechanism of recognition of these human tumors by T lymphocytes. The identification of the HER2/neu-derived peptide GP2 as a TAA in pancreatic cancer provides an opportunity for the design of novel immunotherapy and vaccine strategies.",

Only one of the ROS1-positive FISH cases was characterized by a classical split pattern, the others showed a variant pattern, most commonly involving a loss of the 5' telomeric probe. Considering a positivity threshold of 2+ stained cells, the sensitivity of the ROS1 D4D6 antibody compared to FISH was 100% and the specificity 96.9%, as two HER2-mutated tumors were positive with D4D6 antibody, without any translocation in FISH.

Unfortunately, acquired resistance is an inevitable consequence of this treatment strategy, with a broad variety of resistance mechanisms including acquired EGFR mutations (e.g., T790M) and activation of bypass signaling pathways, such as MET and HER2. Several therapeutic strategies hypothesized to delay or overcome resistance have been tested in clinical trials, including \"next-generation\" EGFR TKIs and rational combinations of targeted agents. However, to date, there are no FDA-approved therapies for patients with acquired resistance to first-line EGFR TKI therapy. There remains a critical need for more effective and better tailored treatments in this setting to match treatments to the individual patient and specific resistance mechanism at hand. In this review, we discuss known mechanisms of resistance to first-line EGFR TKI therapy and describe previous and ongoing strategies to overcome resistance.",

The increasing knowledge of molecular mechanism for survival and proliferation of cancer cells leads to the development of targeted therapies with impressive results for some cancers even if not associated with chemotherapy. These targeted treatments could be monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Inactivation of only one oncogene can lead to the regression of tumours as well as the inhibition of only one pathway with one or more inhibitors. This result is related to the oncogenic addiction of these tumours. Examples are imatinib in CML and GIST, trastuzumab in HER2 positive breast cancer, gefitinib in mutated EGFR, crizotinib in EML4-ALK positive lung cancer and, also, vemurafenib in BRAF 600E mutated metastatic melanoma. We shall specifically discuss HER2 positive breast cancer, which represent some 15-20% of breast cancers and the recent targeted and bi-targeted therapies. Trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody has changed the prognosis of the disease improving survival in the metastatic and adjuvant setting. Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 is approved with capecitabine in trastuzumab resistant patients and in combination with letrozole in first line. Unfortunately, 20% of patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab relapse and metastatic patients only transienly respond to trastuzumab or lapatinib combined with chemotherapy. New HER2 targeted drugs are currently in development like pertuzumab, T-DMI or mTOR and PI3K inhibitors. New strategies combining these drugs with or without chemotherapy showed interesting results in metastatic and neoadjuvant trials. The selection of patients who will most benefit from these combinations is still a challenge. Currently, chemotherapy in association with anti-HER2 therapy remains the most effective treatment option.",

We explored whether all EGFR TKIs similarly select for the T790M mutation using data from early clinical trials and established in vitro models of acquired resistance.;We analyzed the clinical characteristics of eight patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma who were treated first-line with XL647 and then progressed. XL647 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, KDR, and EPHB4. Additional molecular preclinical studies were performed to characterize resistance.;Four patients displayed confirmed partial responses (PRs), three patients had unconfirmed PRs, and one patient displayed stable disease. Only one of five patients' tumor samples available for analysis after disease progression harbored the T790M mutation. Eight patients subsequently received erlotinib, with (n = 3) or without (n = 5) chemotherapy. Three of five patients treated with single-agent erlotinib derived additional benefit, staying on drug up to 9 months. EGFR-mutant PC-9 cells with acquired resistance to XL647 did not harbor the T790M mutation, displayed a distinct mRNA profile from PC-9 cells with T790M-mediated resistance, and were moderately sensitive to erlotinib in growth inhibition assays. Crystal structure analyses of XL647/EGFR T790M did not reveal a different binding mode from that of erlotinib.;The findings of this exploratory study suggest that different EGFR TKIs may select for distinct mechanisms of resistance.

There was a wide range of kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis despite comparable inhibition of the target and associated downstream signaling pathways. Surprisingly, pretreatment RNA levels of the BH3-only pro-apoptotic BIM strongly predicted the capacity of EGFR, HER2, and PI3K inhibitors to induce apoptosis in EGFR-mutant, HER2-amplified, and PIK3CA-mutant cancers, respectively, but BIM levels did not predict responsiveness to standard chemotherapies.

Breast cancers expressing MGB1 were also analyzed clinicopathologically to determine whether these cancers constitute a characteristic subset. Immunohistochemically, MGB1 was expressed specifically in breast cancers. Of the other cancers examined, including 29 of the head and neck, eight of the thyroid, 106 of the lung, 35 of the gastrointestinal tract, three of the pancreas, 14 of the uterine cervix and 13 of the ovary, none were positive for MGB1 except a proportion of salivary gland tumors (6/11, 55%) and endometrial cancers (3/23, 13%). Among the 238 breast cancers, MGB1 was expressed in 114 (48%), most of which were classified histologically as invasive duct or lobular carcinomas. Clinicopathologically, MGB1 expression was associated with positive expression of estrogen receptors and negative expression of CK5, but not with pathological stage, HER2 gene amplification or p53 immunoreactivity. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed prolonged disease-free survival in patients with MGB1-positive breast cancers (log rank test, P=0.016), but the Cox proportional hazard model failed to confirm that MGB1 was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio 1.77, P=0.1755). In terms of practical diagnosis, MGB1 immunohistochemistry can serve as a differential marker of breast cancer metastasis from primary lung cancer for two reasons. Firstly, HER2-positive breast cancer frequently lacks estrogen receptor expression, but MGB1 is expressed in about half of this subtype. Secondly, as primary lung adenocarcinomas may express estrogen receptors, MGB1 expression provides further discrimination of the origin of breast cancers.",

After exposure to different doses of irradiation or a certain dose for different time intervals, the expression of TOB1 mRNA and protein in HBE cells was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Liposome-induced recombinant plasmid transfection and G418 selection were performed to establish a stably transfected TOB1-overexpressing HBE cell line. A clonogenic assay was used to determine the radiosensitivity of the HBE cells with different TOB1 expression statuses. The cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. The ionizing radiation (IR)-induced γ-H2AX foci formation was detected by immunofluorescence assay. The related mechanism was explored by western blot analysis. TOB1 expression in the HBE cells was not induced by IR, neither dose-dependently nor time-dependently. Compared to the parental or 'mock' transfected HBE cells, the radiosensitivity of HBE cells overexpressing TOB1 was significantly decreased (P<0.05). Exogenous TOB1 prevented HBE cells from apoptosis after IR, in contrast to the control cells (P<0.05), and significantly decreased the IR-induced γ-H2AX foci formation. After IR, the expression of DNA damage repair proteins such as XRCC1, MRE11, FEN1 and ATM was increased in the TOB1‑overexpressing HBE cells when compared with the expression levels in the control cells. HBE/TOB1 cells presented a much higher phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated p53 when compared with the levels in the control cell lines when receiving 6 Gy of X-rays. Notably, the increased expression of phosphorylated p53 in HBE/TOB1 cells after IR was sufficiently blocked by U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2. Different from its functions in several lung cancer cell lines, TOB1 demonstrated a radioprotective function in the immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cell line HBE via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that primarily repress target mRNAs. Here, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 were selected as representative cardio-miRs that are upregulated in human heart failure. To bridge the gap between miRNA studies in cardiology and oncology, the targets and functions of these miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and cancers will be reviewed. ACVR1B, BCL2, BIM, eNOS, FGFR3, JPH2, MEN1, MYC, p16, and ST7L are miR-24 targets that have been experimentally validated in human cells. ARID3B, BAK1, BCL2, BMPR1B, ERBB2, FGFR2, IL6R, MUC1, SITR7, Smoothened, STAT3, TET2, and TP53 are representative miR-125b targets. ACVR2A, BCL2, CCND1, E2F3, GLUT3, MYB, RAF1, VEGF, WEE1, and WNT7A are representative miR-195 targets. BCL2L2, ß-catenin, BIM, CADM1, EZH2, FGFR1, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, and TWIST1 are representative miR-214 targets. miR-125b is a good cardio-miR that protects cardiomyocytes; miR-195 is a bad cardio-miR that elicits cardiomyopathy and heart failure; miR-24 and miR-214 are bi-functional cardio-miRs. By contrast, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 function as oncogenic or tumor suppressor miRNAs in a cancer (sub)type-dependent manner. Circulating miR-24 is elevated in diabetes, breast cancer and lung cancer. Circulating miR-195 is elevated in acute myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal adenoma. Circulating miR-125b and miR-214 are elevated in some cancers. Cardio-miRs and onco-miRs bear some similarities in functions and circulation profiles. miRNAs regulate WNT, FGF, Hedgehog and other signaling cascades that are involved in orchestration of embryogenesis and homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of human diseases. Because circulating miRNA profiles are modulated by genetic and environmental factors and are dysregulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations in somatic cells, circulating miRNA association studies (CMASs) within several thousands of cases each for common non-cancerous diseases and major cancers are necessary for miRNA-based diagnostics.

There are currently no effective therapies against metastatic TNBC. Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, EGFR is frequently overexpressed in TNBC and a potential therapeutic target for this disease. There are two types of EGFR inhibitors, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and monoclonal antibody (mAb), for the treatment of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer, however, the clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors have failed due to low response rates. Because a small portion of patients do demonstrate response to EGFR inhibitors, it may be necessary to stratify patients to enhance the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC and to develop the effective combination therapy for this patient population. In this review, we describe some of the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFR inhibitor sensitivity and further discuss the possible therapeutic strategies to increase the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC.

Curcumin is a diferuloylmethane derived from the Indian spice, turmeric (popularly called \"curry powder\") that has been shown to interfere with multiple cell signaling pathways, including cell cycle (cyclin D1 and cyclin E), apoptosis (activation of caspases and down-regulation of antiapoptotic gene products), proliferation (HER-2, EGFR, and AP-1), survival (PI3K/AKT pathway), invasion (MMP-9 and adhesion molecules), angiogenesis (VEGF), metastasis (CXCR-4) and inflammation (NF-kappaB, TNF, IL-6, IL-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX). The activity of curcumin reported against leukemia and lymphoma, gastrointestinal cancers, genitourinary cancers, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, melanoma, neurological cancers, and sarcoma reflects its ability to affect multiple targets.

Studies in PKCδ-/- mice have confirmed a pro-apoptotic role for this kinase in response to DNA damage and a tumor promoter role in some oncogenic contexts. In non-transformed cells, inhibition of PKCδ suppresses the release of cytochrome c and caspase activation, indicating a function upstream of apoptotic pathways. Data from PKCδ-/- mice demonstrate a role for PKCδ in the execution of DNA damage-induced and physiologic apoptosis. This has led to the important finding that inhibitors of PKCδ can be used therapeutically to reduce irradiation and chemotherapy-induced toxicity. By contrast, PKCδ is a tumor promoter in mouse models of mammary gland and lung cancer, and increased PKCδ expression is a negative prognostic indicator in Her2+ and other subtypes of human breast cancer.

Human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro are being used to investigate the functional role of these specific oncogenes and growth regulatory genes in carcinogenesis and tumour progression. When transferred into normal human bronchial epithelial cells by the highly efficient protoplast fusion method, the v-Ha-ras oncogene initiates a cascade of events leading to decreased responsiveness of these cells to inducers of squamous differentiation, aneuploidy and, less frequently, 'immortality' and tumorigenicity with metastasis in athymic nude mice. Transfection of the SV40 T antigen gene results in nontumorigenic cell lines that have a nearly normal pathway of terminal squamous differentiation and can be transformed into malignant cells by transfected Ha-ras, N-ras or Ki-ras. The combination of transfected c-myc and c-raf-1 also transforms human bronchial epithelial cells into neoplastic cells that exhibit some phenotypic traits found in small-cell carcinomas. These and other results indicate that proto-oncogenes dysregulate the pathways of growth and differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells and play an important role in human carcinogenesis. Analyses of allelic deletion and somatic cell hybrids are being used to identify the chromosomal localization of tumour suppressor genes. We have examined 54 non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinomas with 13 polymorphic markers. Loss of heterozygosity was more frequent than among 23 squamous-cell carcinomas than among 23 adenocarcinomas or eight large-cell carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 17p was found in 89% of cases of squamous-cell carcinoma and 18% of adenocarcinomas. Analysis of chromosome 11 for allelic deletions revealed two commonly deleted regions (11p13 and 11p15.5). Somatic cell hybrids between normal human bronchial epithelial cells and Hut292DM, a lung carcinoma cell line, had a finite lifespan in vitro and were nontumorigenic in athymic nude mice. Tumour suppressive effects of individual or combinations of specific human chromosomes on Hut292DM are being examined by formation of microcell-cell hybrids. Chromosome 11 has tumour suppressor activity in these hybrids.

Since ErbBs are closely associated to Mucin 1 (MUC1), a glycoprotein component of airway mucus that is overexpressed in lung tumors, we have investigated the role of this signaling system in the survival response of airway epithelial cells against Ni(2+)-induced cell death. We found that A549 cells exposed to Ni(2+) do not show any significant increase of MUC1 levels. Conversely, Beas-2B cells exposed to equivalent concentrations of Ni(2+) showed increased expression of MUC1 levels and this correlated with increased phosphorylation of both EGFR and of the extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and increase resistance to apoptosis, as indicated by cell viability assessments and DNA damage. Interestingly, suppression of MUC1 by small interfering RNA inhibited the EGFR activation in Beas-2B cells, leading to a significant decrease of survival and enhancement of DNA fragmentation and cleaved Caspase-3 expression.

The current success of molecular targeting therapy is shown by: imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec), targeted to the Bcr/Abl fusion protein derived from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 in chronic myelogenous leukemia; rituximab (Rituxan), a monoclonal antibody to CD20 used in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; trastuzumab (Herceptin), a chimeric monoclonal antibody to HER-2 used in breast cancer; and gefinitib (ZD1839, Irresa), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor used in non-small cell lung cancer. The superior therapeutic efficacy of these molecular targeting agents over traditional chemotherapy has been shown by the survival benefit achieved for patients with advanced or recurrent cancers. Although the precise molecular mechanisms by which these agents produce or enhance an antitumor effect, alone or in combination with anticancer drugs, are not known, the specific inhibition of target genes critically involved in tumor progression and metastasis by the agent is clear. However, further studies to determine which patient groups and anticancer drugs are appropriate for combination therapy with these molecular targeting agents are needed. Herein, we discuss the current status and potential for overcoming drug resistance in solid tumors and focus on the differential features of the tumor microenvironment in solid and hematologic malignancies.",

Here we propose a simple cell by cell correction for autofluorescence that is suitable for multiparameter laser scanning cytometry (LSC) studies in human solid tumors that relies on the ratio of mean autofluorescence to mean total cell fluorescence (mean Flauto/mean Fltotal). This approach assumes a correlation between the autofluorescence component and the total signal in individual cells. This correction does not require specialized instrumentation, and does not sacrifice a data channel in multiparameter studies. A potential disadvantage is that errors may be introduced by the assumption of a correlation between the two components of the total fluorescence signal in individual cells in samples in which no such correlation exists.;Distributions of cell autofluorescence and total Her-2/neu cell fluorescence were obtained separately by LSC in three human breast cancer cell lines and in three samples of primary human lung cancer. In the breast cancer cell lines, autofluorescence measurements and Her-2/neu measurements were also obtained on the same cells.;We show that there is a partial correlation between autofluorescence and total Her-2/neu/FITC fluorescence in individual cells in the three breast cancer cell lines. We also show that the results of a ratio-based autofluorescence correction agree with those based on a true cell by cell correction. Computer simulation studies suggest that in samples with no correlation between the autofluorescence component and the true probe/dye fluorescence component, the ratio correction produces robust estimates of the mean true fluorescence signal, with relatively small but systematic underestimates of the coefficient of variation of such measurements under conditions commonly encountered in the measurement of human solid tumors.;A simple cell by cell correction for autofluorescence based on the ratio of mean Flauto to mean Fltotal can be applied in cell samples in which there is a correlation between cell autofluorescence and true probe/dye fluorescence in individual cells. In cell samples that lack this correlation, or in which it is not known whether such a correlation exists, this correction can be used with the reservation that there is a systematic but relatively small underestimation of the degree of variability of the measurements.",

Preclinical data suggested that anti-VEGF-A therapy may prevent the formation of nsNSCLC brain metastases. Whether non-brain metastases are also prevented, and whether bevacizumab shows a brain metastases-preventive activity in cancer patients is unknown. Data of one nsNSCLC (stage IIIB/IV, AVAiL) and two breast cancer bevacizumab trials (HER2 negative, AVADO; HER2 positive, AVEREL) were retrospectively analyzed regarding the frequency of the brain versus other organs being the site of first relapse. For animal studies, the outgrowth of PC14-PE6 lung adenocarcinoma cells to brain macrometastases in mice was measured by intravital imaging: under control IgG (25 mg/kg) treatment, or varying doses of bevacizumab (25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg). Brain metastases as site of first relapse were significantly less frequent in the bevacizumab arm of the AVAiL trial (HR = 0.36, P < 0.001). In AVADO and AVEREL, no significant difference was seen. In mice, bevacizumab treatment led to secondary regressions of non-brain macrometastases, but did not reduce their total incidence, and did not improve survival. In a brain-seeking nsNSCLC metastasis model, treatment with bevacizumab inhibited brain metastases formation, which resulted in improved overall survival. In summary, bevacizumab has the potential to prevent brain metastases in nsNSCLC, but no preventive activity could be detected outside the brain. These data indicate that anti-VEGF-A agents might be particularly relevant for those stage III nsNSCLC patients who are at high risk to develop future brain metastases.

Three patented mAbs are currently approved in clinical cancer treatment: Trastuzumab (Herceptin) directed against HER2 and used to treat breast cancer, Cetuximab and Panitumumab which are anti-EGFR antibodies approved for colorectal cancer treatment. Unfortunately, these mAbs are facing cancer resistance mediated by paracrine activation of other ErbB members or compensatory ErbB signalling factors. In parallel, three TKIs have been approved to treat cancer: Gefitinib (Iressa), Erlotinib (Tarceva) inhibiting specifically EGFR and approved to treat non small cell lung cancer and Lapatinib (Tykerb) which has the dual specificity EGFR/HER2 and recently approved to treat metastatic breast cancer.

Tumor cells uptake was initially assessed by ICP-MS and MRI on four types of tumor (TUBO, B16-F10, MCF-7, A549) and one healthy (N-MUG) cell lines.

From the clinical editor: In this article, the authors described an improvement to existing boron neutron capture therapy.

HER2 is a potent activator of several signaling pathways that support cell survival, proliferation and metabolism. In HER2-positive breast cancer there are most likely unexplored proteins that act directly or indirectly downstream of well established pathways and take part in tumor development and treatment response.;In order to identify novel copy number variations (CNVs) in HER2-positive breast cancer whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used. A PCR-based loss of heterozygosis (LOH) assay was conducted to verify presence of deletion in HER2-positive breast cancer cases but also in HER2 negative breast cancers, cervical cancers and lung cancers. Screening for mutations was performed using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by PCR sequencing. Protein expression was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC).;A common deletion at chromosome Xq24 was found in 80% of the cases. This locus harbors the gene solute carrier (SLC) family 25A member 43 (SLC25A43) encoding for a mitochondrial transport protein. The LOH assay revealed presence of SLC25A43 deletion in HER2-positive (48%), HER2-negative (9%), cervical (42%) and lung (67%) cancers. HER2-positive tumors with negative or low SLC25A43 protein expression had significantly lower S-phase fraction compared to tumors with medium or high expression (P = 0.024).;We have found deletion in the SLC25A43 gene to be a common event in HER2-positive breast cancer as well as in other cancers. In addition, the SLC25A43 protein expression was shown to be related to S-phase fraction in HER2-positive breast cancer.

Signal transduction elements interact through complex biochemically related networks. Aberrations in signal transduction elements can lead to increased proliferative potential, sustained angiogenesis, tissue invasion and metastasis, and apoptosis inhibition. Most human neoplasms have aberrant signal transduction elements. Several compounds that target aberrant signal transduction elements, such as those in the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors and mammalian target of rapamycin, are in development. To date, commercially available signal-transduction-targeting compounds include trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the ErbB-2 receptor for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer overexpressing the ErbB-2 (HER-2) receptor, and gefitinib, an inhibitor of the ErbB-1 receptor tyrosine kinase that recently received regulatory approval for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In contrast to traditional cytotoxic treatments, although signal transduction inhibitors are capable of inducing tumor regression, particularly in malignancies that are principally driven by specific target aberrations, preclinical and early clinical investigations suggest that their predominant beneficial effects are growth inhibitory in nature; therefore, new clinical trial designs and evaluation end points may be required to ultimately assess their value. Prospective profiling of patients and tumors to determine treatment response is also essential to the success of these clinical trials. However, responsiveness to these novel therapies is dependent on a multitude of factors that ultimately determine the robustness and quality of the downstream response.",

It has been recently reported that molecular-targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are effective in patients with lung carcinoma. In efforts to improve the prognosis of patients with LCNEC, we analyzed gene expression, gene mutations and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of known molecular targets in LCNECs, and compared the expression to that of lung adenocarcinomas (ACs). Thirteen patients with primary LCNEC and 14 patients with AC were analyzed. We evaluated IHC expression for c-KIT, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), gene mutations for EGFR, K-ras and c-kit, and gene expression using fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGFR. In cases with LCNEC, the IHC expression of c-KIT, HER2 and VEGF was 76.9, 30.8 and 100%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the IHC expression of c-KIT and HER2 between the LCNEC and AC cases. Two cases of LCNEC had overexpression of HER2, and the frequency of EGFR gene mutations was higher in the the AC group, with only a single EGFR mutation (exon 18) identified in the LCNEC group. Although LCNEC had a higher rate of expression of c-KIT by IHC, no c-kit gene mutations were found.

As these genes are partially homologous to viral oncogenes and are activated in some tumour cell lines they are termed \"proto-oncogenes\". In tumour cell lines proto-oncogenes are activated by either quantitative or qualitative changes in gene structure: activation of these genes was originally thought to be a necessary primary event in carcinogenesis, but activated cellular oncogenes, unlike viral oncogenes, do not transform normal cells in culture. In experimental models cooperation between two oncogenes can induce transformation of early passage cells, and this has become the basis of an hypothesis for multistep carcinogenesis. Proto-oncogene products also show sequence homology to various components in the mitogenic pathway (growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transducing proteins and nuclear proteins), and it has been postulated that they may cause deregulation of the various components of this pathway. In human tumours single or multiple oncogene activation occurs. The pattern of oncogene activation in common solid malignancies is not consistent within any one class of tumour, nor is it uniform between classes, with three exceptions. In neuroblastoma, breast cancer, and perhaps in lung cancer there is relatively consistent activation of N-myc, neu, and c-myc/N-myc, respectively. Amplification of these genes generally correlates with poor prognosis. The introduction of methods for the direct study of oncogene transcription and their products will undoubtedly broaden our vision of cancer biology in man and, hopefully, add diagnostic and prognostic precision to tumour typing.",

Although both these classifications are essential for personalized treatment, their integrated clinical effect remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed 981 lung adenocarcinomas to detect the potential correlation and combined effect of oncogenic mutations and histological subtype on prognosis. Analysis for oncogenic mutations included the direct sequencing of EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, and RET for oncogenic mutations/rearrangements, and a rereview of the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification was undertaken. Eligible tumors included 13 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia/adenocarcinoma in situ, 20 minimally invasive adenocarcinomas, 901 invasive adenocarcinomas, 44 invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas, and three other variants. The invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas had a lower prevalence of EGFR mutations but a higher prevalence of KRAS, ALK, and HER2 mutations than invasive adenocarcinomas. Smoking, a solid predominant pattern, and a mucinous component were independently associated with fewer EGFR mutations. The ALK rearrangements were more frequently observed in tumors with a minor mucinous component, while the KRAS mutations were more prevalent in smokers. In addition, 503 patients with stage I-IIIA tumors were analyzed for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival. The stage and histological pattern were independent predictors of relapse-free survival, and the pathological stage was the only independent predictor for the OS. Although patients with the EGFR mutations had better OS than those without the mutations, no oncogenic mutation was an independent predictor of survival. Oncogenic mutations were associated with the novel IASLC/ATS/ERS classification, which facilitates a morphology-based mutational analysis strategy. The combination of these two classifications might not increase the prognostic ability, but it provides essential information for personalized treatment. ",

Although p53 immunostaining has been found to correlate with chromosome 17 polysomy in nonsmall cell lung carcinomas, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and bladder carcinomas, its expression has not been correlated with chromosome 17 polysomy in breast carcinomas. In this study, we compared p53 expression by immunohistochemistry in cases of invasive breast carcinoma showing unamplified chromosome 17 polysomy (P) with cases showing HER2 amplification (A) and with those showing neither amplification nor polysomy (N). There was a significant overexpression of p53 in both cases with HER2 amplification and unamplified polysomy 17 compared with cases with neither amplification nor polysomy (7% of N, 25% of P, and 37% of A group were p53 positive). We have shown in an earlier study that invasive breast carcinoma with unamplified chromosome 17 polysomy is associated with several adverse prognostic indicators including a higher Nottingham score and greater estrogen receptor (ER) negativity with a trend toward the amplified group, in contrast to patients with neither amplification nor polysomy. In this study, we now show that p53 positivity in unamplified 17 polysomy identifies cases that are associated with an even higher Nottingham score and greater hormone receptor negativity that is similar to cases with HER2 amplification.",

Immunohistochemistry of erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) and p53 oncogene expression was performed on two separate paraffin tumor blocks for each patient with normal lung as control. Gene amplification of erbB-2 was measured after DNA extraction from 20-micrometer sections of erbB-2-positive and -negative tumors. All analyses were blinded and included Kaplan-Meier survival estimates with Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Two adequate blocks of tumor and normal lung were available for 138 (92%) patients. Immunohistochemical identification of expression of p53 was observed in 49 (37%) patients and erbB-2 in 17 (13%) patients.

Here, we report BAY 80-6946, a highly selective and potent pan-class I PI3K inhibitor with sub-nanomolar IC50s against PI3Kα and PI3Kδ. BAY 80-6946 exhibited preferential inhibition (about 10-fold) of AKT phosphorylation by PI3Kα compared with PI3Kβ in cells. BAY 80-6946 showed superior antitumor activity (>40-fold) in PIK3CA mutant and/or HER2 overexpression as compared with HER2-negative and wild-type PIK3CA breast cancer cell lines. In addition, BAY 80-6946 revealed potent activity to induce apoptosis in a subset of tumor cells with aberrant activation of PI3K as a single agent. In vivo, single intravenous administration of BAY 80-6946 exhibited higher exposure and prolonged inhibition of pAKT levels in tumors versus plasma. BAY 80-6946 is efficacious in tumors with activated PI3K when dosed either continuously or intermittently. Thus, BAY 80-6946 induced 100% complete tumor regression when dosed as a single agent every second day in rats bearing HER2-amplified and PIK3CA-mutated KPL4 breast tumors. In combination with paclitaxel, weekly dosing of BAY 80-6946 is sufficient to reach sustained response in all animals bearing patient-derived non-small cell lung cancer xenografts, despite a short plasma elimination half-life (1 hour) in mice. Thus, BAY 80-6946 is a promising agent with differential pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties for the treatment of PI3K-dependent human tumors.",

Several prognostic factors have been identified for patients with metastatic breast cancer, including tumor volume and location, comorbid conditions, response to prior therapy, and the presence of molecular tumor markers (e.g., estrogen receptors [ER] and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]). Metastatic breast cancer is usually incurable, and the goals of therapy are palliation of symptoms, extending survival, and improving quality of life. Options for the medical management of metastatic breast cancer include endocrine therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and targeted biologic agents. Treatment guidelines developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network generally recommend endocrine therapy for patients with ER-positive or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive disease, for patients with bone or soft tissue metastasis, or those with asymptomatic visceral disease. Cytotoxic chemotherapy alone is usually recommended for patients with ER-negative/PR-negative disease, who have symptomatic visceral disease, or whose tumors are HER2-negative or rapidly growing. Biologic agents (e.g., trastuzumab and lapatinib) alone or in combination are recommended for patients with HER2-positive disease.;Treatment options for meta-static breast cancer continue to increase as new antitumor medications enter clinical practice and controlled clinical trials evaluate the optimal combinations of established and novel medications.",

However, the correlation between the duration and magnitude of Hsp90 inhibition and the downstream effects on client protein degradation and cancer cell growth inhibition has not been thoroughly investigated. To investigate the relationship between Hsp90 inhibition and cellular effects, we developed a method that measures drug occupancy on Hsp90 after treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 in living cells and in tumor xenografts. In cells, we find the level of Hsp90 occupancy to be directly correlated with cell growth inhibition. At the molecular level, the relationship between Hsp90 occupancy and Hsp90 client protein degradation was examined for different client proteins. For sensitive Hsp90 clients (e.g. HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), client protein levels directly mirror Hsp90 occupancy at all time points after IPI-504 administration. For insensitive client proteins, we find that protein abundance matches Hsp90 occupancy only after prolonged incubation with drug. Additionally, we investigate the correlation between plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), tumor PK, pharmacodynamics (PD) (client protein degradation), tumor growth inhibition, and Hsp90 occupancy in a xenograft model of human cancer. Our results indicate Hsp90 occupancy to be a better predictor of PD than either plasma PK or tumor PK. In the nonsmall cell lung cancer xenograft model studied, a linear correlation between Hsp90 occupancy and tumor growth inhibition was found. This novel binding assay was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo and could be used as a pharmacodynamic readout in the clinic.",

The immunostaining results were then correlated with tumor biopathological characteristics and patients' survival. Membranous CD117 immunoreactivity was documented in 19 (22%) of 88 adenocarcinomas and 15 (13%) of 113 squamous cell carcinomas, whereas cytoplasmic labelling was seen in 28 (32%) adenocarcinomas and eight (7%) squamous cell carcinomas. In both tumor types, membranous or cytoplasmic CD117 immunoreactivity was associated with higher proliferative fraction and with features of more aggressive tumor behavior, including higher stage, size and grade, occurrence of clinical symptoms, high microvessel density and neuroendocrine differentiation. Furthermore, immunoreactive tumors exhibited increased levels of bcl-2, cyclin-E, Her-2, p27(Kip1) and fascin, the latter being a marker of tumor cell metastatization in lung cancer. Membranous but not cytoplasmic labelling emerged as an independent risk factor for death and reduced time to progression in adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell carcinoma patients, when singly adjusted for confounding factors. CD117 immunoreactivity identifies a peculiar subset of stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with highly proliferative tumors and may have prognostic relevance in adenocarcinoma patients. Targeting the CD117 pathway could be a novel therapeutic strategy in a subset of pulmonary carcinomas.",

Cilengitide, an αvβ3/αvβ5 integrin inhibitor, has previously been studied as an anti-cancer drug in various tumor types. Previous studies have shown additive effects of cilengitide and radiation in lung cancer and glioblastoma cell lines. The ability of cilengitide to enhance the effects of radiation was examined preclinically in the setting of breast cancer to assess its possible efficacy in the setting of brain metastasis from breast cancer.;Our panel of breast cells was composed of four cell lines: T-47D (ER/PR+, Her2-, luminal A), MCF-7 (ER/PR+, Her2-, luminal A), MDA-MB-231 (TNBC, basal B), MDA-MB-468 (TNBC, basal A). The presence of cilengitide targets, β3 and β5 integrin, was first determined. Cell detachment was determined by cell counting, cell proliferation was determined by MTS proliferation assay, and apoptosis was measured by Annexin V staining and flow cytometry. The efficacy of cilengitide treatment alone was analyzed, followed by assessment of combined cilengitide and radiation treatment. Integrin β3 knockdown was performed, followed by cilengitide and radiation treatment to test for incomplete target inhibition by cilengitide, in high β3 expressing cells.;We observed that all cell lines examined expressed both β3 and β5 integrin and that cilengitide was able to induce cell detachment and reduced proliferation in our panel. Annexin V assays revealed that a portion of these effects was due to cilengitide-induced apoptosis. Combined treatment with cilengitide and radiation served to further reduce proliferation compared to either treatment alone. Following β3 integrin knockdown, radiosensitization in combination with cilengitide was observed in a previously non-responsive cell line (MDA-MB-231). Clonogenic assays suggested little radiosensitization effects of cilengitide.;Cilengitide appears to enhance radiation response in preclinical models of breast cancer. These data suggest that the combination of radiation therapy and cilengitide may prove to be effective where radiation is utilized for the treatment of gross disease in breast cancer, such as in the setting of brain metastasis.",

This might suggest that patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma, who also have tumors with EGFR-activating mutations, might represent a patient population who could benefit from gefitinib or erlotinib therapy. High-resolution melting amplicon analysis (HRMAA) is a recently described technique which can be used for screening tumor DNA isolated from paraffin blocks for tyrosine kinase-activating mutations. In this report we screened 24 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, either primary in the head and neck or secondarily involving the head and neck area, for activating mutations in EGFR exons 18, 19, 20, 21, and for HER2 exons 19 and 20. All cases were followed up by direct DNA sequencing. Two (8%) of the 24 cases were positive. One case was a maxillary sinus tumor which contained an exon 20-activating mutation (N771YinsG). Surprisingly, the other case was a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which invaded the head and neck area only secondarily. This tumor contained an exon 19-activating mutation (G729E). No HER2-activating mutations were found. The presence of a small number of squamous cell carcinomas in the head and neck area with EGFR-activating mutations suggests the existence of a population of patients who could derive benefit from gefitinib or erlotinib therapy.

PKI-402 inhibited growth of human tumor cell lines derived from breast, brain (glioma), pancreas, and non-small cell lung cancer tissue and suppressed phosphorylation of PI3K and mTOR effector proteins (e.g., Akt at T308) at concentrations that matched those that inhibited cell growth. In MDA-MB-361 [breast: Her2(+) and PIK3CA mutant (E545K)], 30 nmol/L PKI-402 induced cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a marker for apoptosis. In vivo, PKI-402 inhibited tumor growth in MDA-MB-361, glioma (U87MG), and lung (A549) xenograft models. In MDA-MB-361, PKI-402 at 100 mg/kg (daily for 5 days, one round) reduced initial tumor volume of 260 mm(3) to 129 mm(3) and prevented tumor regrowth for 70 days. In MDA-MB-361 tumors, PKI-402 (100 mg/kg, single dose) suppressed Akt phosphorylation (at T308) and induced cleaved PARP. Suppression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) was complete at 8 hours and still evident at 24 hours. Cleaved PARP was evident at 8 and 24 hours. In normal tissue (heart and lung), PKI-402 (100 mg/kg) had minimal effect on p-Akt, with no detectable cleaved PARP. Preferential accumulation of PKI-402 in tumor tissue was observed. Complete, sustained suppression of Akt phosphorylation may cause tumor regression in MDA-MB-361 and other xenograft models. We are testing whether dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors can durably suppress p-Akt, induce cleaved PARP, and cause tumor regression in a diverse set of human tumor xenograft models.

However, drug delivery into primary brain tumors and metastases is impeded by the blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB), significantly limiting drug use in brain cancer treatment.;We examined the effect of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in nude mice on drug delivery to intracranially implanted human lung and breast tumors as the most common primary tumors forming brain metastases, and studied underlying mechanisms of drug transport. In vitro assays demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitors enhanced the uptake of [(14)C]dextran and trastuzumab (Herceptin, a humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2/neu) by cultured mouse brain endothelial cells (MBEC). The mechanism of drug delivery was examined using inhibitors for caveolae-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis and coated pit/clathrin endocytosis. Inhibitor analysis strongly implicated caveolae and macropinocytosis endocytic pathways involvement in the PDE5 inhibitor-enhanced Herceptin uptake by MBEC. Oral administration of PDE5 inhibitor, vardenafil, to mice with HER2-positive intracranial lung tumors led to an increased tumor permeability to high molecular weight [(14)C]dextran (2.6-fold increase) and to Herceptin (2-fold increase). Survival time of intracranial lung cancer-bearing mice treated with Herceptin in combination with vardenafil was significantly increased as compared to the untreated, vardenafil- or Herceptin-treated mice (p<0.01). Log-rank survival analysis of mice bearing HER2-positive intracranial breast tumor also showed a significant survival increase (p<0.02) in the group treated with Herceptin plus vardenafil as compared to other groups. However, vardenafil did not exert any beneficial effect on survival of mice bearing intracranial breast tumor with low HER2 expression and co-treated with Herceptin (p>0.05).;These findings suggest that PDE5 inhibitors may effectively modulate BTB permeability, and enhance delivery and therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in hard-to-treat brain metastases from different primary tumors that had metastasized to the brain.",

Our goal was to design a small peptide that possesses similar functions to an antibody drug conjugate with regard to targeting and killing cancer cells, but that overcomes size restrictions.;We designed a novel cancer-specific killer peptide created by fusion of the toxic peptide (KLAKLAK)2 with the cancer recognition peptide LTVSPWY.;This bi-functional peptide showed toxicity to breast cancer, prostate cancer, and neuroblastoma cell lines. Only low toxicity to non-cancer cells, colon cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma cell lines was observed. In vivo injections of the bi-functional peptide caused tumor growth retardation compared to mice treated with control peptides. The bi-functional peptide caused retardation of MDA-MB-435S tumors in vivo and increased survival to 80% at day 100 after tumor implantation, whereas all control animals died at day 70. Previous reports showed that the recognition moiety LTVSPWY targets the tumor-associated antigen HER2. Here we found that our new peptide TP-Tox also excerts toxic effects on HER2-negative cell lines. Therefore, we searched for the molecular target of the bi-specific peptide using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Our data suggest a possible interaction with RAS GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1).;We designed a bi-functional peptide of 23 amino acids and demonstrated its ability to bind and kill several cancer cell lines in vitro and to strongly increase survival in breast cancer bearing mice in vivo.

Molecular diagnosis is a key element to identify oncogenic drivers predicting the efficacy of these agents. In stage IV patients, histopathological diagnosis is often performed on bone metastases biopsy, but routine procedure of decalcification may alter DNA quality for subsequent molecular tests. We set up a procedure to perform molecular analyses on bone metastasis and describe the results of mutational profiling. POUMOS-TEC is a prospective study conducted in stage IV lung adenocarcinomas. Bone metastasis specimens from surgery and CT-scan guided biopsies were sent fresh for immediate formalin-fixation. Decalcification was performed, only when necessary, using EDTA. Controls were processed with acid decalcification. DNA extraction was performed after laser microdissection. Mutational profiling of oncogenic drivers was conducted as recommended by the French National Cancer Institute. Diagnosis efficiency of the computed tomography (CT)-scan guided biopsy process was assessed. Among 177 collected bone metastases specimens, 49 came from lung adenocarcinomas. Specimens processed with no decalcification or EDTA (n=45) provided high-quality DNA. Molecular profiling was performed in 44/45 (98%) of cases. The results of the whole panel of oncogenic drivers (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, HER2 and ALK) were obtained in 41/45 (91%) of cases. A mutation was observed in 50% of cases including 32% of KRAS and 14% of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. CT-scan biopsy efficiency rate was 96%. We demonstrated the feasibility to routinely conduct mutational profiling on bone metastases biopsies. We observed a higher rate of EGFR mutations (+42%) in comparison with the average rate of all stage IV lung adenocarcinomas. This procedure is a new step toward the goal of personalized medicine to treat lung cancers and other osteophilic tumors. ",

The clinical course of patients after given diagnosis of prostate cancer is highly variable and the underlying reasons for such variability remain elusive. To better understand the pathophysiology of prostate cancer, there has been a push to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that mediate the development and progression of prostate cancer. Recent literature has pointed that a complex interplay between various cytokines, growth factors, and androgen receptors regulate the growth and functions of the prostate gland. Amongst the currently implicated anomalous pathways involved in prostate oncogenesis, the IGF-IGFBP axis has been demonstrated to play a very important role, although the precise molecular events regulated by IGF remain to be elucidated. The tumor promoting functions of VEGF has been defined in tumor angiogenesis and currently remains the central focus of anti-angiogenesis therapy in prostate cancer. Another key cytokine, TGF-beta has tumor-suppressor functions in normal prostate gland, but its pleiotropic functions in prostate cancer are influenced by the hormonal state of the disease. In partnership with other deregulated growth factor signaling, the TGF-beta cascade has also been implicated in the spread of prostate cancer. Lastly, members of the EGFR family, particularly the HER2 receptor, have also been recognized as crucial elements of aberrant signal transduction pathways, which induce activation of downstream signaling, involved in cellular proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenesis. The abnormal function of a number of growth factors in prostate cancer biology explains the heterogeneity of its histologic grade, mode of presentation and disease prognosis. At the same time, continued research in this field allows for the potential development of drug therapies against a diverse pool of cancer causing targets.",

However, nothing is currently known about the role of this tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Here, we test the hypothesis that loss of REST function plays a role in breast cancer. To assay breast tumors for REST function, we developed a 24-gene signature composed of direct targets of the transcriptional repressor. Using the 24- gene signature, we identified a previously undefined RESTless breast tumor subtype. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we confirmed the aberrant expression of REST target genes in the REST-less tumors, including neuronal gene targets of REST that are normally not expressed outside the nervous system. Examination of REST mRNA identified a truncated splice variant of REST present in the REST-less tumor population, but not other tumors. Histological analysis of 182 outcome-associated breast tumor tissues also identified a subpopulation of tumors that lack full-length, functional REST and over-express the neuroendocrine marker and REST target gene Chromogranin A. Importantly, patients whose tumors were found to be REST-less using either the 24-gene signature or histology had significantly poorer prognosis and were more than twice as likely to undergo disease recurrence within the first 3 years after diagnosis. We show here that REST function is lost in breast cancer, at least in part via an alternative splicing mechanism. Patients with REST-less breast cancer undergo significantly more early disease recurrence than those with fully functional REST, regardless of estrogen receptor or HER2 status. Importantly, REST status may serve as a predictor of poor prognosis, helping to untangle the heterogeneity inherent in disease course and response to treatment. Additionally, the alternative splicing observed in REST-less breast cancer is an attractive therapeutic target.",

These include but are not limited to the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, used in lymphoma treatment, as well as anti-HER-2 antibody for breast cancer therapy. The efficacy of this cancer immunotherapy modality is, however, limited by the large size of the antibody (160 kd) and its relatively nonspecific binding to the reticuloendothelial system. This latter property is particularly problematic if the antibody is used as a vehicle to deliver radionuclides, cytotoxic drugs, or toxins to the tumor site. Peptides, peptidomimetic, or small molecules are thus attractive as alternative cell surface targeting agents for cancer imaging and therapy. Cancer cell surface targeting peptides can be derived from known native peptide hormones such as somatostatin and bombesin, or they can be identified through screening combinatorial peptide libraries against unknown cell surface receptor targets. Phage-display peptide library and one-bead one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library methods have been successfully used to discover peptides that target cancer cells or tumor blood vessel endothelial cells. The phage-display peptide library method, because of its biological nature, can only display l-amino acid peptides. In contrast, the OBOC combinatorial library method allows for bead-surface display of peptides that contain l-amino acids, d-amino acids, unnatural amino acids, or other organic moieties. We have successfully used the OBOC method to discover and optimize ligands against unique cell surface receptors of prostate cancer, T- and B-cell lymphoma, as well as ovarian and lung cancers, and we have used some of these peptides to image xenografts in nude mice with high specificity. Here, we (i) review the literature on the use of phage-display and OBOC combinatorial library methods to discover cancer and tumor blood vessel targeting ligands, and (ii) report on the use of an ovarian cancer targeting ligand, OA02, as an in vivo PET imaging probe in a xenograft model in nude mice.",

A novel subseries of 4-anilinoquinazolines that possess basic side chains at the C-7 position of the quinazoline nucleus have been synthesized. This subseries contains potent, nanomolar inhibitors of KDR (median IC(50) 0.02 microM, range 0.001-0.04 microM), which are comparatively less potent vs Flt-1 tyrosine kinase (median IC(50) 0.55 microM, range 0.02-1.6 microM). The compounds also retain some inhibitory activity against the tyrosine kinase associated to the endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) (median IC(50) 0.2 microM, range 0.075-0.8 microM) but demonstrate selectivity vs that associated to the FGF receptor 1 (median IC(50) 2.5 microM, range 0.9-19 microM). This selectivity profile is also evident in a growth factor-stimulated human endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation assay (i.e., inhibition of VEGF > EGF > FGF), with inhibition of VEGF-induced proliferation being achieved at nanomolar concentrations (median IC(50) 0.06 microM). Further examination of compound 2 (ZD6474) in recombinant enzyme assays revealed excellent selectivity for the inhibition of KDR tyrosine kinase (IC(50) 0.04 microM) vs the kinase activity of erbB2, MEK, CDK-2, Tie-2, IGFR-1R, PDK, PDGFRbeta, and AKT (IC(50) range: 1.1 to >100 microM). Anilinoquinazolines possessing basic C-7 side chains exhibited markedly improved aqueous solubility over previously described anilinoquinazolines possessing neutral C-7 side chains (up to 500-fold improvement at pH 7.4). In addition, aqueous solubility of the neutral fraction present at pH 7.4 of the basic subseries of anilinoquinazoline proved to be higher than that of the neutral analogue 1 (ZD4190). Oral administration of representative compounds to mice (50 mg/kg) produced plasma levels between 0.2 and 3 microM at 24 h after dosing. Our development candidate 2 demonstrated a very attractive in vitro profile combined with excellent solubility (330 microM at pH 7.4) and good oral bioavailability in rat and dog (> 80 and > 50%, respectively).

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, which have resulted in a decrease in mortality in recent decades, breast cancer remains a major public health problem. One of the most significant unresolved clinical and scientific problems is the occurrence of resistance to clinical treatments and their toxicity (and how to predict, prevent and overcome them). However, the heterogeneity of human breast cancer in terms of genetic features, molecular profiles and clinical behavior represents a constraint obstructing the discovery of a solution to the disease. It is currently considered that the chances of success of therapy may increase if the tumor cells are selectively removed before they can evolve to their mature stages up to metastases production. Therefore, novel and more sensitive diagnostic tools are being developed, with the aim of improving the early and noninvasive detection of rising malignancies and the accuracy of tumor tissue localization. Meanwhile, there is an emerging use of targeted therapies in oncology, depending on the expression of specific proteins or genes present in tumor cells. Among the molecular targets considered for the treatment of breast cancer cells so far, we chose to focus on examples involving overexpression and/or gene amplification of \"Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2\" (HER2) protein. In current studies, various types of nanoparticles conjugated with the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, the so-called \"trastuzumab\", are investigated extensively due to promising results in biological and preclinical applications aimed at improving the treatment of breast cancer. In this paper, we present a critical review of the preparation and use of different kinds of trastuzumab-functionalized nanoparticles, with an emphasis on the therapeutic and diagnostic (theranostic) potential of this generation of hybrid nanoparticles, exploiting the multifaceted mechanisms of action of trastuzumab against malignant cells.",

On the other hand, there are no established biomarkers to predict the bevacizumab efficacy in spite of clinical needs. Therefore, we tried to identify the predictive markers for efficacy of bevacizumab in gastric cancer patients by using bevacizumab-sensitive and insensitive tumor models.;Nine human gastric and two colorectal cancer mouse xenografts were examined for their sensitivity to bevacizumab. We examined expression levels of angiogenic factors by ELISA, bioactivity of VEGF by phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in HUVEC after addition of tumor homogenate, tumor microvessel density by CD31-immunostaining, and polymorphisms of the VEGF gene by HybriProbe™ assay.;Of the 9 human gastric cancer xenograft models used, GXF97, MKN-45, MKN-28, 4-1ST, SC-08-JCK, and SC-09-JCK were bevacizumab-sensitive, whereas SCH, SC-10-JCK, and NCI-N87 were insensitive. The sensitivity of the gastric cancer model to bevacizumab was not related to histological type or HER2 status. All tumors with high levels of VEGF were bevacizumab-sensitive except for one, SC-10-JCK, which had high levels of VEGF. The reason for the refractoriness was non-bioactivity on the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and micro-vessel formation of VEGF, but was not explained by the VEGF allele or VEGF165b. We also examined the expression levels of other angiogenic factors in the 11 gastrointestinal tumor tissues. In the refractory models including SC-10-JCK, tumor levels of another angiogenic factor, bFGF, were relatively high. The VEGF/bFGF ratio correlated more closely with sensitivity to bevacizumab than with the VEGF level.;VEGF levels and VEGF/bFGF ratios in tumors were related to bevacizumab sensitivity of the xenografts tested.

Our goal was to correlate PD-L1 mRNA expression with clinical variables in primary breast carcinomas.;The fluorescent RNAscope paired-primer assay was used to quantify in situ PD-L1 mRNA levels in 636 stage I-III breast carcinomas on two sets of tissue microarrays [YTMA128 (n = 238) and YTMA201 (n = 398)]. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were assessed by hematoxylin/eosin stain and quantitative fluorescence.;On YTMA128 and YTMA201, 55.7% and 59.5% of cases showed PD-L1 mRNA expression, respectively.

We have learned that the clinical development of these agents is far from simple and we need to better understand biological and clinical criteria for patient selection and how to best use the different available agents. The recent discovery of EGFR mutations and the potential identification of other markers that might predict patient response could help to optimize the use of these agents in the future. Irreversible EGFR inhibitors, dual EGF/HER2 and pan-ErbB receptor inhibitors may have greater antitumor activity although the tolerance of these compounds compared to specific EGFR TKIs needs further characterization. HER2 specific TKIs are also in development. Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 TK inhibitors, is particularly promising in breast cancer. Newer agents, such as BMS-599626, have recently entered into the clinic. In addition to the use of these agents as single agents, many clinical studies are addressing the role of combining them with hormonal agents, biological agents or chemotherapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In February 2010, the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) began work on evidence-based reviews of published literature surrounding three pharmacogenomic tests. This project came about when Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) asked MAS to provide evidence-based analyses on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three oncology pharmacogenomic tests currently in use in Ontario.Evidence-based analyses have been prepared for each of these technologies. These have been completed in conjunction with internal and external stakeholders, including a Provincial Expert Panel on Pharmacogenomics (PEPP). Within the PEPP, subgroup committees were developed for each disease area. For each technology, an economic analysis was also completed by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA) and is summarized within the reports.THE FOLLOWING REPORTS CAN BE PUBLICLY ACCESSED AT THE MAS WEBSITE AT: www.health.gov.on.ca/mas or at www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas_about.htmlGENE EXPRESSION PROFILING FOR GUIDING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY DECISIONS IN WOMEN WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER: An Evidence-Based and Economic AnalysisEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation (EGFR) Testing for Prediction of Response to EGFR-Targeting Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Drugs in Patients with Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: An Evidence-Based and Ecopnomic AnalysisK-RAS testing in Treatment Decisions for Advanced Colorectal Cancer: an Evidence-Based and Economic Analysis;To review and synthesize the available evidence regarding the laboratory performance, prognostic value, and predictive value of Oncotype-DX for the target population.;CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION The target population of this review is women with newly diagnosed early stage (stage I-IIIa) invasive breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone-receptor (PR) positive. Much of this review, however, is relevant for women with early stage (I and II) invasive breast cancer that is specifically ER positive, lymph node (LN) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) negative. This refined population represents an estimated incident population of 3,315 new breast cancers in Ontario (according to 2007 data). Currently it is estimated that only 15% of these women will develop a distant metastasis at 10 years; however, a far great proportion currently receive adjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit. There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR) expression.;What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated with the risk of distant recurrence or death due to any cause in women with early breast cancer receiving tamoxifen?What is the predictive value of Oncotype-DX?Does Oncoytpe-DX recurrence score predict significant benefit in terms of improvements in 10-year distant recurrence or death due to any cause for women receiving tamoxifen plus chemotherapy in comparison to women receiving tamoxifen alone?How does Oncotype-DX compare to other known predictors of risk such as Adjuvant! Online?How does Oncotype-DX impact patient quality of life and clinical/patient decision-making?;A literature search was performed on March 19(th), 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1(st), 2006 to March 19(th), 2010. A starting search date of January 1(st), 2006 was because a comprehensive systematic review of Oncotype-DX was identified in preliminary literature searching. This systematic review, by Marchionni et al. (2008), included literature up to January 1(st), 2007. All studies identified in the review by Marchionni et al. as well as those identified in updated literature searching were used to form the evidentiary base of this review. The quality of the overall body of evidence was identified as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology.;Any observational trial, controlled clinical trial, randomized controlled trial (RCT), meta-analysis or systematic review that reported on the laboratory performance, prognostic value and/or predictive value of Oncotype-DX testing, or other outcome relevant to the Key Questions, specific to the target population was included.;Studies that did not report original data or original data analysis,Studies published in a language other than English,Studies reported only in abstract or as poster presentations (such publications were not sought nor included in this review since the MAS does not generally consider evidence that is not subject to peer review nor does the MAS consider evidence that lacks detailed description of methodology).;Outcomes of interest varied depending on the Key Question. For the Key Questions of prognostic and predictive value (Key Questions #2 and #3), the prospectively defined primary outcome was risk of 10-year distant recurrence. The prospectively defined secondary outcome was 10-year death due to any cause (i.e., overall survival). All additional outcomes such as risk of locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival (DFS) were not prospectively determined for this review but were reported as presented in included trials; these outcomes are referenced as tertiary outcomes in this review. Outcomes for other Key Questions (i.e., Key Questions #1, #4 and #5) were not prospectively defined due to the variability in endpoints relevant for these questions."}]
