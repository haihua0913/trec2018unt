No particular risk factor has been clearly identified for ALCL. ALK+ ALCL shows a broad morphologic spectrum, but all cases contain a variable proportion of cells with eccentric, horseshoe- or kidney-shaped nuclei often with an eosinophilic region near the nucleus (hallmark cells). Five morphologic patterns can be recognized. ALK+ ALCL occurs in young subjects (median age ∼35 years), with male predominance, and frequently presents at an advanced stage, with systemic symptoms and extranodal involvement. Near 40% of patients are low risk according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Overall, the prognosis of ALK+ ALCL is remarkably better than other T-cell lymphomas. The IPI and the PIT scores in general predict survival in patients with ALK+ ALCL. Standard first-line treatment for ALK+ ALCL consists of doxorubicin-containing polychemotherapy, which is associated with an overall response rate of ∼90%, a 5-year relapse-free survival of ∼60%, and a 5-year overall survival of 70%. Excellent results have been reported with a variety of anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens including CHOP, CHOEP or MACOP-B. Consolidative high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT) has also been evaluated in patients in first remission with favourable results, however, superiority to standard chemotherapy is unproven and this approach remains investigational. Following universally accepted guidelines for the treatment of failed aggressive lymphomas, HDC/ASCT can effectively salvage a proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory ALK+ ALCL. Recently, the development of novel therapies targeting CD30 and ALK appear promising.",

Brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy is being explored as a first-line therapy in ALCL. Crizotinib is an inhibitor of ALK tyrosine kinase that has been approved for the treatment of ALK non-small cell lung cancer. Successful treatment of ALK ALCL with crizotinib has been reported in pediatric patients and small case series leading to ongoing trials in relapsed/refractory ALCL.

This chromosomal translocation induces the formation of the chimeric protein nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), which possesses significant oncogenic potential resulting from the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase ALK. In addition to its specific pathophysiologic events, NPM-ALK-expressing lymphoma presents with consistent clinical manifestations. Only 13 years after the identification of NPM-ALK, tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of this molecule because of the relentless efforts of multiple investigators who have dissected its biologic roles using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Several upstream modulators, cross-reacting oncogenes, and downstream effectors of NPM-ALK have been identified and characterized. Understanding these interacting oncogenic systems is expected to facilitate the design of new therapeutic strategies and agents. In this review, we briefly discuss ALCL and focus on NPM-ALK.",

Among several pathways triggered by ALK signaling, constitutive activation of STAT3 is strictly required for ALK-mediated transformation and survival. Here we performed genome-wide microRNA profiling and identified 48 microRNA concordantly modulated by the inducible knock-down of ALK and STAT3. To evaluate the functional role of differentially expressed miRNA, we forced their expression in ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, and monitored their influence after STAT3 depletion. We found that the expression of the microRNA-17~92 cluster partially rescues STAT3 knock-down by sustaining proliferation and survival of ALK(+) cells. Experiments in a xenograft mouse model indicated that forced expression of microRNA-17~92 interferes with STAT3 knock-down in vivo. High expression levels of the microRNA-17~92 cluster resulted in down-regulation of BIM and TGFβRII proteins, suggesting that their targeting might mediate resistance to STAT3 knock-down in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells. We speculate that the microRNA-17~92 cluster is involved in lymphomagenesis of STAT3(+) ALCL and that its inhibition might represent an alternative avenue to interfere with ALK signaling in anaplastic large cell lymphomas.

The normal cellular counterpart of this malignancy is presumed to be the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), and this presumption is partly based on the observation that these tumour cells often express cytotoxic granules containing Granzyme B (GzB) and Perforin. Chromosomal translocations involving the gene encoding for the ALK tyrosine kinase are also characteristic of ALK+ ALCL, and the resulting fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK) initiate signalling events important in ALK+ ALCL pathogenesis. These events include the elevated expression of JunB; an AP-1 family transcription factor that promotes ALK+ ALCL proliferation. In this report we demonstrate that JunB is a direct transcriptional activator of GzB and that GzB transcription is also promoted by NPM-ALK. We found that Perforin expression was not regulated by JunB, but was promoted by NPM-ALK in some cell lines and inhibited by it in others. In conclusion, our study makes the novel observation that signalling through NPM-ALK and JunB affect the expression of cytotoxic molecules in ALK+ ALCL. Moreover, these findings demonstrate the expression of GzB and Perforin in this lymphoma is not solely due its presumed CTL origin, but that oncogenic signalling is actively influencing the expression of these proteins.",

Classical Hodgkin lymphoma and ALK(-) anaplastic large cell lymphoma can usually be distinguished by PAX5 expression in the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expression of cytotoxic molecules in tumor cells of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. However, in some cases the differential diagnosis is difficult owing to absence of established markers. To be able to better classify these cases, we reevaluated gene expression data of microdissected tumor cells of both lymphomas for differentially expressed genes. A classifier was established, comprising four genes strongly expressed in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (MDC/CCL22, CD83, STAT3, and TUBB2B). Applying this classifier to a test cohort, Hodgkin lymphoma was successfully distinguished from ALK(-) anaplastic large cell lymphoma with an accuracy of 97% (43/44). MDC/CCL22, CD83, and STAT3 have also been found to be expressed in antigen-presenting cells.

The diagnosis of ALK-positive ALCL has become straightforward due to the generation of the reliable monoclonal antibody ALK-1 that also has led to the recognition of the histologic spectrum of the disease.

Histological subtypes containing small-cell or lymphohistiocytic components indicate a high risk of failure. Minimal disseminated disease (MDD) detected by qualitative RT-PCR for NPM-ALK in bone marrow or blood is associated with a relapse risk of 50%. Quantification of MDD and persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) characterize very high risk patients. Serum ALK-autoantibody titres inversely correlate with relapse risk. The combination of MDD and ALK-antibody titre separates both low and very high risk patients from those with standard risk. In relapse, the time of relapse/progression, central nervous system and bone marrow involvement are major risk factors.

The ablation of ALK leads to the down-modulation of known ALK downstream effectors, cell growth arrest, and reversion of the transformed phenotype of ALK(+) mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo.

Here we show that NPM-ALK impedes CD30 signaling and NF-kappaB activation, dependent on both ALK kinase activity and the N-terminal NPM domain. NPM-ALK transduction into H-RS cell lines abrogates recruitment and aggregation of TRAF proteins, inducing an ALCL-like morphology and phenotype.

The discovery of the t(2;5), involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene on chromosome 2 and the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5 in the majority of systemic ALCL, has soon pointed out that ALCL is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease.

The aim of this review is to illustrate clinical features, histology, immunophenotype, genetics and biology of ALCL and discuss possible relationship(s) among different T-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL).",

We recently reported that ALK-negative ALCLs are genetically heterogenous. The largest subset, representing 30% of cases, had rearrangements of the DUSP22 locus. These cases had favorable outcomes similar to ALK-positive ALCL, and superior to other ALK-negative ALCLs. Here, we examined the morphologic features of these cases in more detail. First, we conducted blinded review of hematoxylin and eosin slides of 108 ALCLs from our previous study, scoring cases for the presence of 3 histologic patterns and 5 cell types. Cases then were unblinded and re-reviewed to understand these features further. DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs were more likely than other ALK-negative ALCLs to have so-called doughnut cells (23% vs. 5%; P=0.039), less likely to have pleomorphic cells (23% vs. 49%; P=0.042), and nearly always (95%) had areas with sheet-like growth (common pattern). To examine the reproducibility of these findings, we conducted blinded review of hematoxylin and eosin slides of 46 additional ALK-negative ALCLs using a 0 to 3 scoring system to predict likelihood of DUSP22 rearrangement, the results of which correlated strongly with subsequent findings by fluorescence in situ hybridization (P<0.0001). Although all ALCLs share certain morphologic features, ALCLs with DUSP22 rearrangements show significant differences from other ALK-negative ALCLs, typically showing sheets of hallmark cells with doughnut cells and few large pleomorphic cells. These morphologic findings and our previous outcome data suggest that ALK-positive ALCLs and DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs represent prototypical ALCLs, whereas ALCLs lacking rearrangements of both DUSP22 and ALK require further study.

ALK+ ALCL is also characterized by strong activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity and overexpression of two AP-1 transcription factors, CJUN and JUNB. Here, we hypothesized that a biologic link between AP-1 and AKT kinase may exist, thus contributing to ALCL oncogenesis. We show that JUNB and CJUN bind directly to the AKT1 promoter, inducing AKT1 transcription in ALK+ ALCL. Knockdown of JUNB and CJUN in ALK+ ALCL cell lines downregulated AKT1 mRNA and promoter activity and was associated with lower AKT1 protein expression and activation. We provide evidence that this is a transcriptional control mechanism shared by other cell types even though it may operate in a way that is cell context-specific. In addition, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)-induced control of AKT1 transcription was functional in ALK+ ALCL and blocking of STAT3 and AP-1 signaling synergistically affected cell proliferation and colony formation.

We previously demonstrated that Jak3 potentiates the activity of NPM-ALK. Jak3 activation is restricted to interleukins that recruit the common gamma chain (gammac) receptor, including IL-9. NPM-ALK was previously shown to promote widespread lymphomas in IL-9 transgenic mice by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that IL-9 plays an important role in ALK+ ALCL via Jak3 activation. Our studies demonstrate the expression of IL-9Ralpha and IL-9 in 3 ALK+ ALCL-cell lines and 75% and 83% of primary tumors, respectively. IL-9 was detected in serum-free culture medium harvested from ALK+ ALCL-cell lines, supporting autocrine release of IL-9. Treatment of these cells with an anti-IL-9-neutralizing antibody decreased pJak3 and its kinase activity, along with pStat3 and ALK kinase activity. These effects were associated with decreased cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar and cell-cycle arrest. Evidence suggests that cell-cycle arrest can be attributed to up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of Pim-1.

A subset of ALCL is characterized by chromosomal translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene on chromosome 2. While the most common translocation is the t(2;5)(p23;q35) involving the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5, up to 12 other translocations partners of the ALK gene have been identified. One of these is the t(1;2)(q25;p23) which results in the formation of the chimeric protein TPM3-ALK. While several of the signaling pathways induced by NPM-ALK have been elucidated, those involved in ALCLs harboring TPM3-ALK are largely unknown. In order to investigate the expression profiles of ALCLs carrying the NPM-ALK and TPM3-ALK fusions, we carried out cDNA microarray analysis of two ALCL tissue samples, one expressing the NPM-ALK fusion protein and the other the TPM3-ALK fusion protein. RNA was extracted from snap-frozen tissues, labeled with fluorescent dyes and analyzed using cDNAs microarray containing approximately 9,200 genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Quantitative fluorescence RT-PCR was performed to validate the cDNA microarray data on nine selected gene targets. Our results show a significant overlap of genes deregulated in the NPM-ALK and TPM-ALK positive lymphomas. These deregulated genes are involved in diverse cellular functions, such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, proliferation, and adhesion. Interestingly, a subset of the genes was distinct in their expression pattern in the two types of lymphomas.

In previous studies of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), we showed that inhibition of Jak3 down-regulates activated/phosphorylated Stat3 (pStat3), decreases anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) enzymatic activity, and induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALK-positive ALCL. These findings implicate Jak3 as playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of ALK-positive ALCL; most likely via Stat3 and ALK activation. To assess this possibility, we used immunohistochemical staining to evaluate the frequency of expression of Jak3 and its activated/phosphorylated form (pJak3) in 48 systemic ALCL tumors included in a tissue microarray. pJak3 was detected in 17 (81%) of 21 ALK-positive tumors, compared with 3 (11%) of 27 ALK-negative tumors (P < .0001, Fisher exact test). pStat3 was present in 12 (86%) of 14 ALK-positive tumors and in 10 (40%) of 25 ALK-negative tumors assessed (P = .0078). Of 12 ALK-positive/pStat3-positive tumors, 8 (67%) expressed pJak3, but none of 10 ALK-negative/pStat3-positive tumors expressed pJak3. We conclude that Jak3 activation is predominantly restricted to ALK-positive ALCL tumors. Most likely, Jak3 collaborates with ALK in activating Stat3, leading to cell survival, cell-cycle progression, and tumor growth. In contrast, the mechanism of Stat3 activation in ALK-negative ALCL tumors appears to be independent of Jak3.",

Because it has been shown that STAT3 can be inhibited by STAT1 in some experimental models, we hypothesized that the STAT1 signaling pathway is defective in ALK+ ALCL, thereby leaving the STAT3 signaling unchecked. Compared with normal T cells, ALK+ ALCL tumors consistently expressed a low level of STAT1. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway appreciably increased STAT1 expression in ALK+ ALCL cells. Furthermore, we found evidence that NPM-ALK binds to and phosphorylates STAT1, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation in a STAT3-dependent manner. If restored, STAT1 is functionally intact in ALK+ ALCL cells, because it effectively upregulated interferon-γ, induced apoptosis/cell-cycle arrest, potentiated the inhibitory effects of doxorubicin, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. STAT1 interfered with the STAT3 signaling by decreasing STAT3 transcriptional activity/DNA binding and its homodimerization. The importance of the STAT1/STAT3 functional interaction was further highlighted by the observation that short interfering RNA knockdown of STAT1 significantly decreased apoptosis induced by STAT3 inhibition. Thus, STAT1 is a tumor suppressor in ALK+ ALCL. Phosphorylation and downregulation of STAT1 by NPM-ALK represent other mechanisms by which this oncogenic tyrosine kinase promotes tumorigenesis. ",

We have identified a distinct profile of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) that characterize ALCL; furthermore, this profile distinguishes ALK(+) from ALK(-) subtypes, and thus points toward potential mechanisms of tumorigenesis induced by aberrant ALK. Using a nucleophosmin-ALK transgenic mouse model as well as human primary ALCL tumor tissues and human ALCL-derived cell lines, we reveal a set of overlapping deregulated miRNAs that might be implicated in the development and progression of ALCL. Importantly, ALK(+) and ALK(-) ALCL could be distinguished by a distinct profile of \"oncomirs\": Five members of the miR-17-92 cluster were expressed more highly in ALK(+) ALCL, whereas miR-155 was expressed more than 10-fold higher in ALK(-) ALCL. Moreover, miR-101 was down-regulated in all ALCL model systems, but its forced expression attenuated cell proliferation only in ALK(+) and not in ALK(-) cell lines, perhaps suggesting different modes of ALK-dependent regulation of its target proteins. Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR, which is targeted by miR-101, led to reduced tumor growth in engrafted ALCL mouse models.

In this study, we hypothesized that NPM-ALK promotes the oncogenic activity of β-catenin via its functional interactions with the Wnt canonical pathway (WCP). To test this hypothesis, we examined if NPM-ALK modulates the gene expression of various members in the WCP. Using a Wnt pathway-specific oligonucleotide array and Western blots, we found that the expression of casein kinase 2α (CK2α) was substantially downregulated in ALK(+)ALCL cells in response to siRNA knockdown of NPM-ALK. CK2α is biologically important in ALK(+)ALCL, as its inhibition using 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole or siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth and a substantial decrease in the β-catenin protein level. Furthermore, CK2α co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK and regulated its level of serine phosphorylation, a feature previously shown to correlate with the oncogenic potential of this fusion protein. To conclude, this study has revealed a novel crosstalk between NPM-ALK and CK2α, and our data supports the model that these two molecules work synergistically to promote the tumorigenicity of these lymphomas.",

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) ALCL is associated with the NPM-ALK t(2;5) translocation, which is highly correlated with the identification of the ALK protein by immunohistochemistry. ALK+ ALCL typically occurs in younger patients and has a more favorable prognosis with 5-year survival rates of 70% to 90% in comparison with 40% to 60% for ALK-negative (ALK-) ALCL. Studies support young age as a strong component of the favorable prognosis of ALK+ ALCL. Until recently, no recurrent translocations were identified in ALK- ALCL. However, emerging data now highlight that ALK- ALCL is genetically and clinically heterogeneous with a subset having either a DUSP22 translocation and a survival rate similar to ALK+ ALCL or a less common P63 translocation, the latter associated with an aggressive course. Anthracycline-based regimens such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) remain the standard first-line treatment choice for systemic ALCL, but in many patients with ALK- ALCL, it is ineffective, and thus it is often followed by consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation. However, selection of appropriate patients for intensified therapy remains challenging, particularly in light of genetic and clinical heterogeneity in addition to the emergence of new, effective therapies. The antibody drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin is associated with a high response rate (86%) and durable remissions in relapsed/refractory ALCL and is under investigation in the first-line setting. In the future, combining clinical and genetic biomarkers may aid in risk stratification and help guide initial patient management. ",

In this study, we have investigated 46 cases of ALCL for expression and localization of ALK protein and its association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (by hybridization to EBV-encoded nuclear RNA-1 [EBER-1] and immunostaining for LMP-1). ALCL patients with a null cell phenotype were significantly younger as compared with those of T-cell phenotype (mean age: 28 years v 42 years; P =.018). Sixteen of 46 ALCL cases (34%) were ALK positive. ALK-positive patients were significantly younger (mean age: 25 years for those with both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining; 22 years for those with exclusive cytoplasmic staining; and 41 years for those negative for the ALK gene; P =.023). EBER-1 was detected in 9 of 46 cases (20%), and LMP-1 expression was noted in 5 of them. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, all EBV-associated cases that were investigated showed type I EBV.

Their treatment, based on aggressive chemotherapy, is not optimal since ALCL patients can still expect a 30% 2-year relapse rate. Tumor relapses are very aggressive and their underlying mechanisms are unknown. Crizotinib is the most advanced ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is already used in clinics to treat ALK-associated cancers. However, crizotinib escape mechanisms have emerged, thus preventing its use in frontline ALCL therapy. The process of autophagy has been proposed as the next target for elimination of the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this study, we investigated whether autophagy is activated in ALCL cells submitted to ALK inactivation (using crizotinib or ALK-targeting siRNA). Classical autophagy read-outs such as autophagosome visualization/quantification by electron microscopy and LC3-B marker turn-over assays were used to demonstrate autophagy induction and flux activation upon ALK inactivation. This was demonstrated to have a cytoprotective role on cell viability and clonogenic assays following combined ALK and autophagy inhibition. Altogether, our results suggest that co-treatment with crizotinib and chloroquine (two drugs already used in clinics) could be beneficial for ALK-positive ALCL patients. ",

Most of ALCLs (85%) carry a chromosomal translocation involving different partners in the 5' portion, and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor kinase domain in the 3' portion. These translocations induce the ectopic expression of X-ALK proteins, thought to be involved in lymphomagenesis, through the dysregulation of cell proliferation and apoptotic pathways. In the present study, based on several ALK+ and ALK- ALCL cell lines and biopsy specimens, we showed that serpin A1, a secretory glycoprotein, was overexpressed in ALK+ ALCL cell lines and ALK+ tumors at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The crucial role of NPM-ALK in the regulation of serpin A1 expression was further demonstrated by using both ectopic expression and downregulation, by RNA interference, of the NPM-ALK oncogene. In addition, in ALK+ tumors, serpin A1 expression appeared to be correlated with the clinical status of the patients as the serpin A1 mRNA level was higher in patients presenting with extranodal dissemination. These data, together with the pattern of expression of serpin A1 we observed in ALK+ tumors, suggest that serpin A1 has an invasion-promoting effect in ALK+ ALCL.",

Using RT-PCR and Western blots, Twist1 was detectable in all 3 ALK+ALCL cell lines examined but absent in normal T-cells. By immunohistochemistry, Twist1 was detectable in all 10 cases of ALK+ALCL examined; benign lymphoid tissues were consistently negative. Twist1 expression in ALK+ALCL cells can be attributed to the NPM-ALK/STAT3 signaling axis, the key oncogenic driving force in this tumor type. Twist1 is biologically important in ALK+ALCL cells, as Twist1 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in their invasiveness in an in-vitro assay. Further investigation revealed that this increase in invasiveness is linked to the activation of AKT and down-regulation of p66Shc, two signaling proteins known to be involved in NPM-ALK-mediated oncogenesis. Lastly, knockdown of Twist1 sensitizes ALK+ALCL cells to the growth inhibitory effect of PF-2341066 (Crizotinib®), an ALK inhibitor being used in clinical trials.

It induces JAK3/STAT3 signaling, a biologically important cellular pathway activated in most cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-expressing anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+)ALCL). Therefore, we hypothesize that IL-21 may contribute to JAK3/STAT3 activation and cell growth in ALK(+)ALCL. By reverse transcription-PCR, we found consistent expression of IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) in all ALK(+)ALCL cell lines and frozen tumors examined. IL-21 was also consistently expressed in ALK(+)ALCL tumors, although its mRNA was detectable in only one of three cell lines tested. By immunohistochemistry, we examined 10 paraffin-embedded ALK(+)ALCL tumors; all cases were positive for both IL-21 and IL-21R in these neoplastic cells. IL-21 signaling is biologically significant in ALK(+)ALCL since the addition of recombinant IL-21 enhanced the activation of JAK3/STAT3 and significantly increased cell growth in ALK(+)ALCL cell lines. However, small interfering RNA down-regulation of IL-21R significantly decreased both STAT3 activation and cell growth. IL-21R expression is not linked to nucleophosmin-ALK since forced expression of nucleophosmin-ALK and small interfering RNA down-regulation of nucleophosmin-ALK did not significantly change the expression of either IL-21R or IL-21. Our findings thus support the enhancement of JAK3/STAT3 activation and cell growth in ALK(+)ALCL via IL-21 signaling.

She presented with inguinal, axillary, and paraaortic lymph node swellings that showed spontaneous regression over a 3-month period, followed by recurrence after an interval of 8 months. Radiological and clinical findings indicated Ann Arbor stage IIIA. Pathological findings showed that staining of ALK was restricted to the cytoplasm of ALCL cells. ATIC-ALK chimeric transcripts were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The patient was assigned to the standard risk group proposed by the international multicenter study for pediatric ALCL, ALCL99. The patient responded well to the treatment and remained in complete remission for more than 26 months. To date, 7 genes have been identified as a fusion partner of ALK, with the highest frequency in nucleophosmin (NPM). Little is known about the clinical implications of subtypes of ALCL harboring each of the 7 fusion genes, especially those of variant fusion genes other than NPM-ALK. In this paper, we review 9 patients with ATIC-ALK-positive ALCL in the literature in addition to discussing our patient. In eight of these 10 cases, disease occurred within the first three decades. Five of 6 cases that were followed continuously remained in complete remission.",

In this study, we assessed whether the Dvls are important in the pathogenesis of ALK(+)ALCL. By Western blotting, Dvl-2 and Dvl-3 were found to be highly expressed in ALK(+)ALCL cell lines and patient samples. The higher molecular weight forms, consistent with phosphorylated/active Dvl proteins, were observed in these lysates. siRNA knock-down of Dvls did not affect the Wnt canonical pathway, as assessed by the β-catenin protein levels and nuclear localization. In contrast, the same treatment led to changes in the transcriptional activity of NFAT and the phosphorylation status of Src, both of which are known to be regulated by the Wnt non-canonical signaling pathways in other cell types. Coupled with these biochemical changes, there was a significant decrease in cell growth and soft agar colony formation. NPM-ALK, the oncogenic tyrosine kinase characteristic of ALK(+)ALCL, was found to bind to the Dvls and enhance their tyrosine phosphorylation. In conclusion, our data suggest that the Dvls contribute to the pathogenesis of ALK(+)ALCL via signaling in the Wnt non-canonical pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating a physical and functional interaction between the Dvls and an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.",

To fully assess the biologic significance of loss of SHP1 in ALK(+)ALCL, we transfected SHP1 plasmids into 2 SHP1(-), ALK(+)ALCL cell lines, Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1. After 24 hours of transfection, pJAK3 and pSTAT3 were decreased, and these changes correlated with down-regulation of STAT3 downstream targets including cyclin D3, mcl-1, and bcl-2. Expression of SHP1 in these 2 cell lines also resulted in marked decreases in the protein levels of JAK3 and NPM-ALK, and these effects were reversible by proteosome inhibitor MG132. Conversely, when SHP1 expression in SUP-M2 (a SHP1(+) ALK(+)ALCL cell line) was inhibited using siRNA, pSTAT3, pJAK3, JAK3, and NPM-ALK were all up-regulated. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that SHP1 was physically associated with JAK3 and NPM-ALK. SHP1 expression in Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 led to significant G(1) cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. To conclude, loss of SHP1 contributes to the pathogenesis of ALK(+)ALCL by 2 mechanisms: (1) it leaves the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK3/STAT3 unchecked and (2) it decreases proteosome degradation of JAK3 and NPM-ALK.",

This study is the first complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis using RNA extracted from tumor tissue (7 ALK+ ALCLs and 7 ALK- ALCLs) to identify genes differentially expressed or shared between the ALK+ and ALK- tumors. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the top 11 most statistically significant discriminator cDNAs correctly grouped all ALK+ and ALK- tumors. Hierarchical clustering analysis using the 44 cDNAs with the greatest differential expression between ALK+ and ALK- RNAs grouped 6 of 7 ALK+ ALCLs together and 1 ALK+ ALCL with the ALK- group. In general, ALK+ tumors overexpress genes encoding signal transduction molecules (SYK , LYN , CDC37) and underexpress transcription factor genes (including HOXC6 and HOX A3 ) compared with the ALK- group. Cyclin D3 was overexpressed in the ALK+ group and the cell cycle inhibitor p19INK4D was decreased in the ALK- group, suggesting different mechanisms of promoting G 1 /S transition. Both groups had similar proliferation rates.

In this report, we describe the existence of an autocrine stimulatory loop involving interleukin-22 (IL-22) that contributes to STAT3 activation and tumorigenicity of ALK(+)ALCL. The IL-22 receptor, a heterodimer composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2, was expressed in all ALK(+)ALCL cell lines and tumors examined. The expression of IL-22R1 in ALK(+)ALCL is aberrant, as this protein is absent in benign lymphocytes. Although ALK(+)ALCL cells produce endogenous IL-22, addition of recombinant IL-22 to ALK(+)ALCL cell lines significantly increased STAT3 activation, cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Opposite biological effects were observed in cells treated with recombinant IL-22 binding protein (a naturally occurring IL-22 decoy) or IL-22-neutralizing antibody. Nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, the characteristic fusion gene oncoprotein expressed in ALK(+)ALCL, directly contributes to the aberrant expression of IL-22R1, as transfection of NPM-ALK in Jurkat cells-induced IL-22R1 expression and IL-22-mediated STAT3 activation. To conclude, for the first time, we demonstrate the importance of the IL-22 autocrine pathway in a lymphoid malignancy, and reveal yet another novel function of NPM-ALK.",

Biopsies were immunostained with antibodies against CD30, ALK, T- and B-cell antigens.;Persistent skin lesions developed after solitary insect bites in three patients and after multiple bites in two. Regional lymphadenopathy developed within weeks after the bite in three cases. In four cases the correct diagnosis was delayed due to misinterpretation of the findings as a reactive infiltrate in the skin (n=2) or lymph nodes (n=2); all cases subsequently showed small numbers of cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for ALK. The final diagnoses were lymphohistiocytic variant (n=3) and composite common/small cell type (n=2) anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The patients were treated and three were alive at the last follow-up.

Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is regarded as an ALK-negative variant confined to the skin and is part of the spectrum of primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Thirty-three of 487 pediatric patients registered within the Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma-99 trial (1999 to 2006) presented with a skin limited CD30-positive lympho-proliferative disorder. In 23 of the 33 patients, material for international histopathological review was available, and the cases were studied for histopathological, immunophenotypical and clinical features as well as for breaks within the ALK gene. Five of 23 cases and one additional case (identified after closure of the trial) expressed ALK-protein. Complete staging excluded any other organ involvement in all children. Expression of ALK proteins was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in all cases and the presence of breaks of the ALK gene was genetically confirmed in 5 evaluable cases. The histopathological and clinical picture of these skin-restricted ALK-positive lymphomas was indistinguishable from that of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Five children presented with a single skin lesion that was completely resected in 4 and incompletely resected in one. Three of these patients received no further therapy, 2 additional local radiotherapy, and one chemotherapy. All children remain in complete remission with a median follow up of seven years (range 1-8 years). We present 6 pediatric cases of ALK-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphomas.

As the chimeric tyrosine kinase is involved in tumorigenesis and pathogenesis of ALCL, we were interested to inhibit NPM-ALK expression using an exogenous and an endogenous ribozyme approach.;We designed five anti-ALK hammerhead ribozymes that were targeted to cleave the ALK proportion of NPM-ALK. The ribozyme with the highest cleavage activity was used as a modified RNA/DNA chimera (RZ1*) for transient transfection and as a self-splicing ribozyme vector (pRZ1) for endogenous expression. Ribozyme performance was tested in 293 cells (cotransfected with NPM-ALK) and in the ALCL cell line Karpas 299 by transient and stable transfection and Western blotting. The half-life time of NPM-ALK was determined by pulse-chase experiments.;In vitro cleavage assays demonstrated different catalytic efficiencies depending on the targeted site of the substrate. Constant transfection of Karpas 299 cells with RZ1* for 96 hours did not lead to a significant reduction of NPM-ALK protein, presumably due to the long half-life of NPM-ALK (48 hours). In contrast, NPM-ALK protein expression was almost completely suppressed in transiently transfected 293 cells. Stable transfection of Karpas 299 cells with pRZ1 also resulted in significant reduction of NPM-ALK expression.;These results suggest that ribozymes targeted against NPM-ALK are able to inhibit expression of this oncogenic kinase efficiently and will be a useful tool to analyze its role in the pathophysiology of ALCL.",

These transcription factors are involved in the regulation of various aspects of cellular growth and differentiation. Although C/EBPbeta has important functions in B- and T-cell differentiation, its expression has not been well studied in lymphoid tissues. We, therefore, analyzed its expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in normal lymphoid tissues and in 248 well-characterized lymphomas and lymphoma cell lines. Nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues and most B-cell, T-cell, and Hodgkin lymphomas lacked detectable levels of C/EBPbeta. In contrast, most (40 of 45; 88%) cases of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) strongly expressed C/EBPbeta. Western blot analysis confirmed C/EBPbeta expression in the ALK-positive ALCLs and demonstrated elevated levels of the LIP isoform, which has been associated with increased proliferation and aggressiveness in carcinomas. Transfection of Ba/F3 and 32D cells with NPM-ALK and a kinase-inhibitable modified NPM-ALK resulted in the induction of C/EBPbeta and demonstrated dependence on NPM-ALK kinase activity. In conclusion, we report the constitutive expression of C/EBPbeta in ALK-positive ALCL and show its relationship to NPM-ALK.

The latter is capable of activating ERK kinase, which upregulates JUNB expression through ETS1. JUNB, in turn, interacts with the TNFRSF8 (CD30) gene promoter and induces CD30 (TNFRSF8) overexpression. However, the role of CD30 overexpression in ALK+ ALCL oncogenesis remains unknown. Here we show that the JUNB gene is frequently amplified in ALK+ ALCL, suggesting gene amplification as an additional underlying mechanism for JUNB overexpression. Silencing of JUNB resulted in reduced cell growth and colony formation associated with decreased activator protein-1 activity and G1/S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. These effects were linked to decreased CD30 levels, downregulation of CCNA2 (Cyclin A), CCND2 (Cyclin D2) and CCND3 (Cyclin D3) and upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2A (p14) and CDKN1A (p21), but not CDKN1B (p27). Similar cell cycle changes were observed following the knock-down of TNFRSF8 gene or blockade of its function using anti-CD30 antibodies, which were associated with upregulation of CDKN2A and CDKN1A, but not CDKN1B. These findings indicate that JUNB may partly operate through CD30 signalling. Silencing of JUNB also sensitized NPM1-ALCL+ cells to standard chemotherapeutic agents.

In the present study, we analyzed ALK kinase domain mutational status of 36 paediatric ALCL patients at diagnosis to identify point mutations and gene aberrations that could impact on NPM-ALK gene expression, activity and sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors. Amplicon ultra-deep sequencing of ALK kinase domain detected 2 single point mutations, R335Q and R291Q, in 2 cases, 2 common deletions of exon 23 and 25 in all the patients, and 7 splicing-related INDELs in a variable number of them. The functional impact of missense mutations and INDELs was evaluated. Point mutations were shown to affect protein kinase activity, signalling output and drug sensitivity. INDELs, instead, generated kinase-dead variants with dominant negative effect on NPM-ALK kinase, in virtue of their capacity of forming non-functional heterocomplexes. Consistently, when co-expressed, INDELs increased crizotinib inhibitory activity on NPM-ALK signal processing, as demonstrated by the significant reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation. Functional changes in ALK kinase activity induced by both point mutations and structural rearrangements were resolved by molecular modelling and dynamic simulation analysis, providing novel insights into ALK kinase domain folding and regulation. Therefore, these data suggest that NPM-ALK pre-therapeutic mutations may be found at low frequency in ALCL patients.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of these aberrant immune-phenotypes is largely unknown. Here, we report that microRNA-135b (miR-135b) mediates nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK)-driven oncogenicity and empowers IL-17-producing immunophenotype in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). NPM-ALK oncogene strongly promoted the expression of miR-135b and its host gene LEMD1 through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. In turn, elevated miR-135b targeted FOXO1 in ALCL cells. miR-135b introduction also decreased chemosensitivity in Jurkat cells, suggesting its contribution to oncogenic activities of NPM-ALK. Interestingly, miR-135b suppressed T-helper (Th) 2 master regulators STAT6 and GATA3, and miR-135b blockade attenuated IL-17 production and paracrine inflammatory response by ALCL cells, indicating that miR-135b-mediated Th2 suppression may lead to the skewing to ALCL immunophenotype overlapping with Th17 cells. Furthermore, antisense-based miR-135b inhibition reduced tumor angiogenesis and growth in vivo, demonstrating significance of this \"Th17 mimic\" pathway as a therapeutic target. These results collectively illuminated unique contribution of oncogenic kinase-linked microRNA to tumorigenesis through modulation of tumor immune-phenotype and microenvironment.",

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering demonstrated distinct clustering of ALCL, PTCL-NOS, and the AITL subtype of PTCL. Cases of ALK(+) ALCL and ALK(-) ALCL were interspersed in unsupervised analysis, suggesting a close relationship at the molecular level. We identified an miRNA signature of 7 miRNAs (5 upregulated: miR-512-3p, miR-886-5p, miR-886-3p, miR-708, miR-135b; 2 downregulated: miR-146a, miR-155) significantly associated with ALK(+) ALCL cases.

Previous studies have reported differences in apoptotic rate and expression levels of apoptosis regulatory proteins between ALK+ and ALK- ALCL. In this study, we assessed for expression of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway proteins cytochrome c, apoptosis protease-activating factor 1, and procaspase 9 in 2 ALK+ ALCL cell lines and 42 ALCL tumors (17 ALK+, 25 ALK-). We used the Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cell lines, and the inhibitors Z-LEHD-FMK (specific for caspase 9) and Boc-D-FMK (general caspase inhibitor) to investigate the role of caspase 9 activation in chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death. Caspase 9 activity was significantly increased in Karpas-299 and SU-DHL-1 cells after chemotherapy treatment, but remained as low as control levels with addition of either caspase inhibitor. Both caspase inhibitors rescued a substantial fraction of Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cells from drug-induced cell death. In ALCL tumors, expression of cytochrome c, apoptosis protease-activating factor 1, and procaspase 9 was also assessed and correlated with apoptotic rate and activated caspase 3 levels. Cytochrome c was expressed in all 13 (100%) ALK+ and 18 (95%) of 19 ALK- ALCL tumors. Apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 was detected in 14 (88%) of 16 ALK+ and 19 (79%) of 24 ALK- ALCL tumors. Procaspase 9 was expressed in 5 (30%) of 17 ALK+ and 2 (8%) of 25 ALK- ALCL tumors (P = .09). In the entire study group (ALK+ and ALK- ALCL), procaspase 9 expression levels significantly correlated with apoptotic rate (P = .02) and activated caspase 3 levels (P = .05). This correlation could not be shown in the ALK+ or ALK- ALCL subgroups, presumably because of the small sample size. In conclusion, chemotherapy-induced cell death in ALK+ ALCL cells involves the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and apoptosome function may be an important determinant of apoptosis in ALCL tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) provides an excellent example of how molecular insights into tumor pathogenesis are influencing and improving tumor classification. ALCL was described initially as a subtype of T-cell/null-cell lymphoma characterized by unusual tumor cell morphology and the expression of CD30. However, it was soon recognized that a subset of ALCLs contained chromosomal translocations involving anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a novel receptor tyrosine kinase gene. These rearrangements create chimeric genes encoding self-associating, constitutively active ALK fusion proteins that activate a number of downstream effectors, including phospholipase C-gamma, phosphoinositol 3'-kinase, RAS, and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins, all of which seem potentially important in cellular transformation. Not all tumors classified as ALCLs have ALK rearrangements and, conversely, ALK rearrangements occur in lymphomas of widely varying morphology. Hence, only molecular markers can reliably identify ALK+ ALCL. The importance of doing so is reflected by clinical studies suggesting that ALK+ ALCLs have a significantly better prognosis than other aggressive peripheral T-cell or B-cell lymphomas, including ALK- ALCLs. The unique molecular pathogenesis of ALK+ ALCL is likely to lead to novel therapeutic approaches directed at specific inhibition of ALK or downstream effectors.",

Consistent with flavopiridol activity, phosphorylation at cdk2, cdk4, cdk9 sites on RB and RNA polymerase II was inhibited. This correlated with induction of cell death through rapid mitochondrial damage, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and transcripts.

Among 70% to 80% of ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are caused by the aberrant oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK. Crizotinib was the first clinically relevant ALK inhibitor, now approved for the treatment of late-stage and metastatic cases of lung cancer. However, patients frequently develop drug resistance to Crizotinib, mainly due to the appearance of point mutations located in the ALK kinase domain. Fortunately, other inhibitors are available and in clinical trial, suggesting the potential for second-line therapies to overcome Crizotinib resistance. This study focuses on the ongoing phase I/II trial small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AP26113, by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which targets both ALK and EGFR. Two NPM-ALK(+) human cell lines, KARPAS-299 and SUP-M2, were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of AP26113, and eight lines were selected that demonstrated resistance. All lines show IC50 values higher (130 to 1,000-fold) than the parental line. Mechanistically, KARPAS-299 populations resistant to AP26113 show NPM-ALK overexpression, whereas SUP-M2-resistant cells harbor several point mutations spanning the entire ALK kinase domain. In particular, amino acid substitutions: L1196M, S1206C, the double F1174V+L1198F and L1122V+L1196M mutations were identified. The knowledge of the possible appearance of new clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance is a useful tool for the management of new TKI-resistant cases.;This work defines reliable ALCL model systems of AP26113 resistance and provides a valuable tool in the management of all cases of relapse upon NPM-ALK-targeted therapy.",

Of the 160 cases, 103 (64.4%) were positive for CD99. The distribution of CD99 positivity was similar for nodal (66/103 [64.1%]), extranodal, (21/32 [66%]), and primary cutaneous lesions (16/25 [64%]). CD99 expression was present in 96 (64.4%) of 149 of the common type, 4 (80%) of 5 of the small cell variant, and 3 (50%) of 6 of the lymphohistiocytic variant cases.

Sporadic variant 2p23/ALK abnormalities identified in ALK-positive ALCL indicate that genes other than NPM may also be involved in the deregulation of ALK and lymphomagenesis. We report here three cases with an inv(2)(p23q35) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in young male patients with ALK-positive ALCL. In contrast to ALCL cases with the classical t(2;5)(p23;q35) that usually show both cytoplasmic and nuclear or predominantly nuclear alone localization of the NPM-ALK chimeric product, in all three cases with an inv(2)(p23q35) the ALK protein accumulated in the cytoplasm only, supporting the previous assumption that the oncogenic potential of ALK may not be dependent on its nuclear localization. As the first step to identify the ALK partner gene involved in the inv(2)(p23q35), we performed extensive FISH studies and demonstrated that the 2q35 breakpoint occurred within the 1,750-kb region contained within the 914E7 YAC. Moreover, a striking association of the inv(2)(p23q35) with a secondary chromosomal change, viz, ider(2)(q10)inv(2)(p23q35), carrying two additional copies of the putative ALK-related fusion gene, was found in all three patients, suggesting that, in contrast to the standard t(2;5)/NPM-ALK fusion, multiple copies of the putative 2q35-ALK chimeric gene may be required for efficient tumor development. In summary, we demonstrate that the inv(2)(p23q35), a variant of the t(2;5)(p23;q35), is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in ALK-positive ALCL, the further characterization of which should provide new insight into the pathogenesis of these lymphomas.",

In line with this function, Sox2 expression is largely restricted to ESCs and somatic stem cells. We report that Sox2 is expressed in cell lines and tumor samples derived from ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+)ALCL), for which the normal cellular counterpart is believed to be mature T-cells. The expression of Sox2 in ALK(+)ALCL can be attributed to nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), the oncogenic fusion protein carrying a central pathogenetic role in these tumors. By confocal microscopy, Sox2 protein was detectable in virtually all cells in ALK(+)ALCL cell lines. However, the transcriptional activity of Sox2, as assessed using a Sox2-responsive reporter construct, was detectable only in a small proportion of cells. Importantly, downregulation of Sox2 using short interfering RNA in isolated Sox2(active) cells, but not Sox2(inactive) cells, resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth, invasiveness and tumorigenicity. To conclude, ALK(+)ALCL represents the first example of a hematologic malignancy that aberrantly expresses Sox2, which represents a novel mechanism by which NPM-ALK mediates tumorigenesis. We also found that the transcriptional activity and oncogenic effects of Sox2 can be heterogeneous in cancer cells.",

SHP1, a tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates JAK/STAT, is frequently absent in ALK+ ALCL owing to gene methylation. To test the hypothesis that loss of SHP1 contributes to JAK3/STAT3 activation in ALK+ ALCL cells, we induced SHP1 expression using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, in ALK+ ALCL cell lines, and correlated with changes in the JAK3/STAT3 pathway. 5-AZA gradually restored SHP1 expression in Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cells over 5 days. The initially low level of SHP1 expression did not result in significant changes to the expression or tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT3. However, higher levels of SHP1 seen subsequently correlated with substantial decreases in JAK3 and pJAK3, followed by pSTAT3 (but not STAT3). Importantly, the decrease in JAK3 was abrogated by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. 5-AZA induced no significant increase in apoptosis but it sensitized ALCL cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Our findings support the concept that loss of SHP1 contributes to the constitutive activation of JAK3/STAT3 in ALK+ ALCL cells.

The simulations reveal the predominant role of the VAV1-CDC42 (cell division control protein 42) pathway in NPM-ALK-driven cellular proliferation and of the Ras / mitogen-activated ERK kinase (MEK) / extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade in controlling cell survival. Our results also highlight the importance of a group of interleukins together with the Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) / signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling in the development of NPM-ALK derived ALCL. Depending on the activity of JAK3 and STAT3, the system may also be sensitive to activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP1), which has an inhibitory effect on cell survival and proliferation.

In view of the oncogenic potential of STAT3, we further examined its biological significance in ALCL using two ALK(+) ALCL cell lines (Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1) and an adenoviral vector that carries dominant-negative STAT3 (AdSTAT3DN). Infection by AdSTAT3DN led to the expression of STAT3DN in both ALK(+) ALCL cell lines at a similar efficiency. Subcellular fractionation studies showed that a significant proportion of the expressed STAT3DN protein translocated to the nucleus, despite the fact that STAT3DN has a mutation at residue 705(tyrosine --> phenylalanine), a site that is believed to be crucial for STAT3 activation and nuclear translocation.

Both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms account for the constitutive expression of the protein, and the PI3K/Akt pathway is essential for this process. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CDC25 dramatically inhibits the proliferation of NPM/ALK-expressing cells, while moderately affecting the proliferation of control Ba/F3 cells. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of CDC25A confirmed that NPM/ALK-expressing cells are highly dependent on this protein for their proliferation. Moreover, similar PI3K/AKt-mediated constitutive expression of CDC25A takes place down-stream of other hematological oncogenes, including BCR/ABL in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and FLT3-ITD in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

Although the t(2;5) product nucleophosmin-ALK has been extensively studied for its transforming properties, very little is known regarding cooperative genetic mutations that may contribute to lymphomagenesis and may predict survival outcome, specifically in a purely pediatric population. We set out to determine the frequency and positions of genomic imbalances in this relatively rare disease. We collected biopsy material from 15 UK-resident children with ALK-expressing ALCL. We performed array comparative genomic hybridization at a resolution of 1 MB using DNA isolated from tumor tissue. Some of the more common genomic gains were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Regions of genomic gain were far more common than losses and were most often detected on chromosomes 1-4, 5-12, 14, and 17, with Chromosome 11 being the most frequent site of genomic imbalances. Patients with 14 or fewer imbalances had a lower overall 3-year survival (87.5-40%, P = 0.14) as did patients with gains in the regions of DDB1 or BIRC5. A range of genomic imbalances exist in ALK-expressing ALCL of a pediatric origin, with a greater number associated with poorer overall survival.",

Here we demonstrate that HSP90 is overexpressed in primary and cultured ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL cells, and we evaluate the potential role of the small molecule inhibitor of HSP90, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in treating ALCL.;The antiproliferative effect of 17-AAG-cultured cells was determined by MTS assay. Apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest were determined by Annexin-V/propidium iodide and propidium iodide staining, respectively, and fluorescein-activated cell sorting analysis. Expression of HSP90 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and molecular changes were determined by Western blot.;Treatment of cultured ALCL cells with 17-AAG induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, irrespective of ALK expression. At the molecular level, 17-AAG induced degradation of ALK and Akt proteins, dephosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and degraded the cell-cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1 and its cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, but had a differential effect on p27 and p53 proteins. Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation by the mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor U0126 induced cell death in all ALCL cell lines, and sublethal concentration 17-AAG showed synergistic antiproliferative effects when combined with U0126 or doxorubicin.;Our data demonstrate that targeting HSP90 function by 17-AAG may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for ALCL, either as single-agent activity or by combining 17-AAG with conventional or targeted therapeutic schemes.",

Recently, a fusion protein containing anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was described in systemic nodal ALCL, and shown to be associated with a good prognosis. The aims of this study were to investigate whether the presence of ALK protein differs between ALCL of different sites of origin; to determine whether ALK expression occurs before dissemination to other sites; and, finally, to investigate whether the site of origin remains a prognostic parameter in ALK negative ALCL.;ALK expression, as detected by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibodies ALK1 and ALKc, was studied in 85 ALCLs from different sites of origin. In 22 patients, ALK expression was studied in multiple biopsies from different sites (including 13 skin, 16 lymph node, and nine other). Overall survival time was analysed using the Kaplan Meier method.;ALK expression was found in 20 of 51 systemic ALCLs with (primary) nodal involvement. No ALK expression was found in 15 primary cutaneous, 14 gastrointestinal, and five nasal ALCLs. Multiple and subsequent biopsies of patients showed ALK expression to be identical to that seen in the primary diagnostic biopsy. Kaplan Meier survival curves showed that in ALK negative ALCLs originating from different sites, primary cutaneous cases are associated with an excellent overall survival, whereas the other cases show a comparable five years survival of less than 40%.;If present, ALK expression favours systemic ALCL with (primary) nodal involvement, and can be used in differentiating between extranodal involvement of systemic (nodal) ALCL and primary extranodal ALCL. ALK is expressed consistently in multiple biopsies of a given patient, indicating that the chromosomal abnormality leading to aberrant ALK expression occurs before dissemination to other sites. Finally, in ALK negative non-cutaneous ALCLs, different sites of origin show comparable poor survival.",

Approximately 20% of ALCLs that express ALK do not contain the t(2;5), suggesting that other genetic abnormalities can result in aberrant ALK expression. Here we report the molecular characterization of an alternative genetic means of ALK activation, the inv(2)(p23q35). This recurrent abnormality produces a fusion of the amino-terminus of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), a bifunctional homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate and final steps of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, with the intracellular portion of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase. RT-PCR analysis of 5 ALCL tumors that contained the inv(2) revealed identical ATIC-ALK fusion cDNA junctions in all of the cases. Transient expression studies show that the ATIC-ALK fusion transcript directs the synthesis of an approximately 87-kd chimeric protein that is localized to the cytoplasm, in contrast to NPM-ALK, which typically exhibits a cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular distribution. ATIC-ALK was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and could convert the IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line BaF3 to cytokine-independent growth. Our studies demonstrate an alternative mechanism for ALK involvement in the genesis of NHL and suggest that ATIC-ALK activation results from ATIC-mediated homodimerization. In addition, expected decreases in ATIC enzymatic function in ATIC-ALK-containing lymphomas may render these tumors more sensitive to antifolate drugs such as methotrexate.

Although ALK-positive ALCLs have a more favorable outcome than ALK-negative ALCL, refractory and/or relapsed forms are common and novel treatments are needed. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of a novel bromodomain inhibitor, OTX015/MK-8628 in ALK-positive ALCLs.The effects of OTX015 on a panel of ALK+ ALCL cell lines was evaluated in terms of proliferation, cell cycle and downstream signaling, including gene expression profiling analyses. Synergy was tested with combination targeted therapies.Bromodomain inhibition with OTX015 led primarily to ALCL cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner, along with downregulation of MYC and its downstream regulated genes. MYC overexpression did not compensate this OTX015-mediated phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis of OTX015-treated ALCL cells identified a gene signature common to various hematologic malignancies treated with bromodomain inhibitors, notably large cell lymphoma. OTX015-modulated genes included transcription factors (E2F2, NFKBIZ, FOS, JUNB, ID1, HOXA5 and HOXC6), members of multiple signaling pathways (ITK, PRKCH, and MKNK2), and histones (clusters 1-3). Combination of OTX015 with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib led to cell cycle arrest then cell death, and combination with suboptimal doses of the ALK inhibitor CEP28122 caused cell cycle arrest. When OTX015 was associated with GANT61, a selective GLI1/2 inhibitor, C1156Y-resistant ALK ALCL growth was impaired.These findings support OTX015 clinical trials in refractory ALCL in combination with inhibitors of interleukin-2-inducible kinase or SHH/GLI1.",

These translocations generate fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK) with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, which activate numerous signalling pathways important for ALK+ ALCL pathogenesis. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) plays a critical role in allowing NPM-ALK and other signalling proteins to function in this lymphoma. Co-chaperone proteins are important for helping Hsp90 fold proteins and for directing Hsp90 to specific clients; however the importance of co-chaperone proteins in ALK+ ALCL has not been investigated. Our preliminary findings suggested that expression of the immunophilin co-chaperone, Cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), is up-regulated in ALK+ ALCL by JunB, a transcription factor activated by NPM-ALK signalling. In this study we examined the regulation of the immunophilin family of co-chaperones by NPM-ALK and JunB, and investigated whether the immunophilin co-chaperones promote the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines.;NPM-ALK and JunB were knocked-down in ALK+ ALCL cell lines with siRNA, and the effect on the expression of the three immunophilin co-chaperones: Cyp40, FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 51, and FKBP52 examined. Furthermore, the effect of knock-down of the immunophilin co-chaperones, either individually or in combination, on the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines and NPM-ALK levels and activity was also examined.;We found that NPM-ALK promoted the transcription of Cyp40 and FKBP52, but only Cyp40 transcription was promoted by JunB. We also observed reduced viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines treated with Cyp40 siRNA, but not with siRNAs directed against FKBP52 or FKBP51. Finally, we demonstrate that the decrease in the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines treated with Cyp40 siRNA does not appear to be due to a decrease in NPM-ALK levels or the ability of this oncoprotein to signal.;This is the first study demonstrating that the expression of immunophilin family co-chaperones is promoted by an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.

To study the function of ALK, an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system was stably introduced into cultured human ALCL cells. Inducing shRNA expression in the generated cells resulted in cellular ALK gene silencing and led to inactivation of multiple signaling pathways and growth arrest. Interestingly, a combination of ALK gene silencing with U0126, a kinase inhibitor specific for the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 pathway, resulted in an augmented reduction in cellular JunB expression. Functional studies indicated that combining ALK gene silencing with U0126 treatment provided a synergistic growth inhibition, which occurred faster and was more profound than with either treatment alone. This synergistic effect was also observed when measuring cell proliferation, apoptosis, and in vitro cell colony formation. Importantly, the combination of ALK gene silencing and U0126 had a prolonged inhibitory effect, preventing recovery of ALCL cell growth even after treatments were removed. Moreover, this synergistic inhibitory effect was confirmed in vivo using a mouse model with xenografted ALCL tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive lymphoma that is frequently associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35), resulting in expression of a fusion protein, nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), which can be detected by either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to the ALK protein. The clinical features of adults with ALCL are incompletely described, and the prognostic factors that are useful for predicting survival remain unclear. This report describes the clinical and laboratory findings in 70 adults with systemic ALCL who were treated with curative intent. We attempted to identify the clinical and pathological factors of prognostic importance, including the International Prognostic Index (IPI), immunophenotype, and expression of the ALK protein. The median age of the patients was 49 years (range, 15 to 75). There were 26 women and 44 men with a median follow-up of 50 months for living patients. Advanced stage was present in 56% and B symptoms were noted in 70% of the patients. Immunostains showed that 46% of the cases had a T-cell phenotype, 36% a null phenotype, and 18% a B-cell phenotype. The expression of ALK protein was found in 51% of the cases. The IPI factors were evenly distributed between the ALK+ and ALK- groups, except that the ALK+ patients were younger (median age, 30 v 61 years; P <.002). The ALK+ cohort included cases with null (44%), T-cell (42%), and B-cell (14%) phenotypes. All 10 cases with cytogenetic or molecular evidence of a t(2;5) were ALK+. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 65%. The 5-year OS of the ALK+ and ALK- cases was 79% and 46%, respectively (P <.0003). Analysis of only the T-cell/null cases (n = 57) showed a 5-year OS of 93% for the ALK+ cases and only 37% for the ALK- cases (P <.00001). Univariate analysis of the clinical features showed that age </=60 years (P <.007), a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P <.00001), a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] <2) (P <.03), </=1 extranodal site of disease (P <.012), and an IPI score </=3 (P <.00001) were associated with improved OS. Although a younger age correlated with ALK positivity, multivariate analysis showed that only a normal serum LDH (P <. 00001), an IPI score of </=3 (P <.0005), and ALK protein expression (P <.005) predicted independently for an improved OS. We conclude that ALCL is a heterogeneous disorder. However, ALK protein expression is an independent predictor of survival and serves as a useful biologic marker of a specific disease entity within the spectrum of ALCL.",

In this study, we assessed ALK+ and ALK- ALCL tumors for p53 gene alterations using PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing methods. We also immunohistochemically assessed ALCL tumors for p53 expression. Three of 36 (8%) ALCL tumors (1/14 ALK+, 2/22 ALK-) with adequate DNA showed p53 gene mutations. By contrast, p53 was overexpressed in 36 of 55 (65%) ALCL tumors (16 ALK+, 20 ALK-). p21, a target of p53, was expressed in 15 of 31 (48%) ALCL tumors including seven of 15 (47%) p53-positive tumors. p21 expression in a subset of ALCL suggests the presence of functional p53 protein. Apoptotic rate was significantly higher in p53-positive than p53-negative tumors (mean 2.78 vs 0.91%, P = 0.0003). We conclude that the p53 gene is rarely mutated in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL tumors.

Given that survivin is a target of the STAT3 signaling pathway and STAT3 is activated in ALCL, survivin expression was also correlated with STAT3 activation.;Survivin was expressed in 34 tumors (55%) and did not correlate with ALK. A significant association between survivin expression and STAT3 activation was observed (P =.007, Fisher's exact test). For the ALK-positive group, the 5-year failure-free survival (FFS) was 34% for patients with survivin-positive ALCL compared with 100% for patients with survivin-negative ALCL (P =.009, log-rank test). For the ALK-negative group, the 5-year FFS was 46% for patients with survivin-positive tumors compared with 89% for patients with survivin-negative tumors (P =.03, log-rank test). Overall survival was similarly worse for patients with survivin-positive tumors in both the ALK-positive and ALK-negative groups. Furthermore, multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of survivin expression, along with age older than 60 years and Ann Arbor stage III or IV.;Survivin is expressed in approximately half of ALCL tumors and independently predicts unfavorable clinical outcome.

To further study survival signaling by NPMALK, we generated Ba/F3 cell lines with either inducible or constitutive expression of NPM-ALK and examined the regulation of the AKT target FOXO3a. We hypothesized that NPM-ALK signaling through phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and AKT would regulate FOXO3a, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, thereby stimulating proliferation and blocking programmed cell death in NPM-ALK-transformed cells. In Ba/F3 cells with induced or constitutive expression of NPM-ALK, concomitant AKT activation and phosphorylation of its substrate, FOXO3a, was observed. In addition, transient expression of NPM-ALK in U-20S cells inhibited FOXO3a-mediated transactivation of reporter gene expression. Furthermore, NPM-ALK-induced FOXO3a phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells resulted in nuclear exclusion of this transcriptional regulator, up-regulation of cyclin D2 expression, and down-regulation of p27(kip1) and Bim-1 expression. NPMALK reversal of proliferation arrest and of p27(kip1) induction was dependent on the phosphorylation of FOXO3a.

All cases were studied by FISH using dual color break apart probes of ALK for detection of chromosomal translocation, compared with the previous results of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of ALK aberrations.;The result of FISH showed that the clear red and green fluorescence signals were detected in 38 cases of ALCL, in which conspicuous split signals were observed in tumor cells in 24 cases (63.2%), suggesting the rearrangement of the ALK locus, with multiple copies of ALK gene in one case. In addition, the rearrangement of the ALK locus was not identified in 14 of 38 cases (36.8%); and the FISH results were unable to be evaluated in 7 cases, because no fluorescent signals involving ALK gene were found or signals were too weak to be analyzed.

The interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is known to be highly expressed in both ALK(+) and ALK(-) ALCLs. However, the role of IRF4 in the pathogenesis of these lymphomas remains unclear. Here we show that ALCLs of both subtypes are addicted to IRF4 signaling, as knockdown of IRF4 by RNA interference was toxic to ALCL cell lines in vitro and in ALCL xenograft mouse models in vivo. Gene expression profiling after IRF4 knockdown demonstrated a significant downregulation of a variety of known MYC target genes. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that MYC is a primary target of IRF4, identifying a novel regulatory mechanism of MYC expression and its target gene network in ALCL. MYC, itself, is essential for ALCL survival, as both knockdown of MYC and pharmacologic inhibition of MYC signaling were toxic to ALCL cell lines. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ALCLs are dependent on IRF4 and MYC signaling and that MYC may represent a promising target for future therapies. ",

The anaplastic lymphoid cell line TS1G6 established by interleukin (IL)-9 transfection of T-helper cells represents a murine model of this subtype. Here, we describe the cytogenetic features of this cell line using spectral karyotyping (SKY) and single-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We show that TS1G6 cells exhibit a hypotetraploid karyotype with complex structural alterations. Several unbalanced translocations involved the chromosomal region 14E5, and different translocation partners, i.e. X?A6, 3A3 and 8A1. FISH analysis using a BAC clone containing c-myc confirmed the presence of six copies, but also demonstrated that two loci were irregularly located, indicating that additional intrachromosomal rearrangements had occurred. Moreover, a duplication of the region XF2 approximately 3 was identified.

We recently identified recurrent rearrangements of the DUSP22 locus on 6p25.3 in both primary cutaneous and systemic ALK-negative ALCLs. This study aimed to determine the relationship between these rearrangements and expression of the chemokine receptor gene, CCR8. CCR8 has skin-homing properties and has been suggested to play a role in limiting extracutaneous spread of primary cutaneous ALCLs. However, overexpression of CCR8 has also been reported in systemic ALK-negative ALCLs. As available antibodies for CCR8 have shown lack of specificity, we examined CCR8 expression using quantitative real-time PCR in frozen tissue and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in paraffin tissue. Both approaches showed higher CCR8 expression in ALCLs with DUSP22 rearrangements than in nonrearranged cases (PCR: 19.5-fold increase, P=0.01; ISH: 3.3-fold increase, P=0.0008). CCR8 expression was not associated with cutaneous presentation, cutaneous biopsy site, or cutaneous involvement during the disease course. These findings suggest that CCR8 expression in ALCL is more closely related to the presence of DUSP22 rearrangements than to cutaneous involvement and that the function of CCR8 may extend beyond its skin-homing properties in this disease. This study also underscores the utility of RNA-ISH as a paraffin-based method for investigating gene expression when reliable antibodies for immunohistochemical analysis are not available. ",

There were 10 males and 3 females with a median age of 49 years old. Seven presented with pure nodal disease and 5 had bony involvement. The staging results were stage I (5 patients), II (1), III (1), and IV (4). The pathologic subtypes were common variant (10), lymphohistiocytic variant (2), and small cell variant (1). Eleven tumors were of T-cell lineage; 2, null-cell. Immunohistochemically, 5 tumors (38.5%) expressed cytotoxic markers, T-cell intracellular antigen-1 and/or granzyme B. Two tumors (15.4%) expressed anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Long-term follow-up information was available in 8 patients. The 2 patients with ALK-expressing tumors (37 and 49 years old) were free of disease for 61 and 54 months, respectively. The other 6 patients were either died of disease (5 patients) or experienced relapse with progressive disease (1). In conclusion, we reported the largest series of ALCL in Taiwan. We confirmed ALK-expressing ALCL carries favorable prognosis and ALK-negative ALCL has similar poor prognosis as non-anaplastic T-cell lymphoma.

We have shown previously that MUC-1 is expressed as a consequence of t(1;14)(q21;32) in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. ALCLs are known to express MUC-1, but its clinical significance is undefined. For this study, eligible patients with ALCL were HIV negative, received anthracycline-containing regimens, and had pretreatment archival tissue. Expression of MUC-1 and ALK was determined immunohistochemically after heat-induced antigen retrieval. A 10% cutoff for MUC-1 positivity was used. We identified 63 patients with systemic ALCL (22 ALK+, 41 ALK-) with a median age of 47 years, and 41 were male. MUC-1 was detected in 16 of 22 (73%) ALK-positive and 20 of 41 (49%) ALK-negative ALCL (P = 0.06, chi(2) test). MUC-1 expression was not associated with apoptotic rate as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay or proliferation index as evaluated by MIB-1 antibody. For 48 patients with ALCL (16 ALK+, 32 ALK-) and complete clinical follow-up, 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 39.7% for patients with MUC-1-positive tumors versus 75.2% (P = 0.027 by Log-rank) for patients with MUC-1-negative tumors. For the ALK-negative ALCL group of 32 patients, the 5-year PFS was 26 versus 70.8% for patients with MUC-1-positive versus MUC-1-negative tumors (P = 0.0096 by Log-rank). For the ALK-positive ALCL group of 16 patients, the 5-year PFS was 52 versus 100% for patients with MUC-1-positive versus MUC-1-negative tumors (P, not significant). In summary, MUC-1 is frequently expressed in systemic ALCL, and its expression is associated with significantly inferior outcome in patients untreated previously with ALK-negative tumors.

The examples predominated by small cells or showing a mixed cell population can be difficult to recognize as being neoplastic. We report four such cases with a remarkably hypocellular granulation tissue-like appearance, mimicking an inflammatory or reparative process. All patients were young and presented with lymphadenopathy in multiple sites. The lymph node biopsies showed a hypocellular appearance, with wide separation of the small to medium-sized lymphoid cells by edematous or fibromyxoid stroma. There were interspersed spindly neoplastic cells resembling myofibroblasts, sometimes forming short, sweeping fascicles, as well as histiocytes. Occasional large cells with atypical nuclei were identified. The larger lymphoid cells tended to form cuffs around the venules. In two cases, the capsule and fibrous trabeculae were markedly broadened with increased spindly cells, mimicking inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph node. Immunostaining showed dispersed and clustered CD30+ ALK+ cells, confirming a diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. In conclusion, a diagnosis of hypocellular anaplastic large cell lymphoma requires a high index of suspicion. The young age of the patients and the presence of perivascular cuffs of larger lymphoid cells should provide the strongest clues to the correct diagnosis.",

Using the SSH technique, we compared the transcriptome of 2 cases of ALK+ and ALK- anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and of 2 cases of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) with opposite behavior. Regarding ALCL, we showed that ALK-positive tumors overexpressed genes involved in different signaling pathways such as activation or signaling of T-cells, regulation of apoptosis, phospholipase Cgamma and phosphatidyl inositol-3 Kinase. In addition, the characterization of a specific molecular signature may be of clinical relevance since ALK+ tumors generally have a better prognosis than ALK- ones. Similar problems of differential prognosis is observed in cases of cHL, which in addition, may be morphologically and immunologically indistinguishable. Therefore, we applied the same SSH technique to 2 cHL samples from patients with favorable and poor outcome, respectively. Forty-four cDNAs were significantly overexpressed in the poor outcome case. In addition to the defender against death cell 1 (DAD1) gene, overexpressed clones corresponded mostly to expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Interestingly, the present study identifies new genes which may be involved in the pathogenesis and/or clinical outcome of cHL and deserve further investigations.",

Previously, NPM-ALK had been shown to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. As the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27(Kip1) (p27) is usually not expressed in ALCL, we hypothesized that activated Akt (pAkt) phosphorylates p27 resulting in increased p27 proteolysis and cell cycle progression. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of pAkt activity in ALCL decreases p27 phosphorylation and degradation, resulting in increased p27 levels and cell cycle arrest. Using immunohistochemistry, pAkt was detected in 24 (57%) of 42 ALCL tumors, including 8 (44%) of 18 ALK-positive tumors and 16 (67%) of 24 ALK-negative tumors, and was inversely correlated with p27 levels. The mean percentage of p27-positive tumor cells was 5% in the pAkt-positive group compared with 26% in the pAkt-negative group (P = .0076).

In our study, we retrospectively analyzed 92 patients with S-ALCL from the Peking University Lymphoma Center for clinical and molecular prognostic factors to make clear the role of ALK and other prognostic factors in Han Chinese S-ALCL.;The majority of Chinese S-ALCL patients were young male patients (median age 26, male/female ratio 1.7) and the median age was younger than previous reports regardless of ALK expression status. The only statistically significant different clinical characteristic in S-ALCL between ALK positive (ALK+) and ALK negative (ALK-) was age, with a younger median age of 22 for ALK+ compared with 30 for ALK-. However, when pediatric patients (≤ 18) were excluded, there was no age difference between ALK+ and ALK-. The groups did not differ in the proportion of males, those with clinical stage III/IV (49 vs 51%) or those with extranodal disease (53 vs 59%). Of 73 evaluable patients, the 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 60% and 47%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that three factors: advanced stage III/IV, lack of expression of ALK, and high Ki-67 expression, were associated with treatment failure in patients with S-ALCL. However, ALK expression correlated with improved survival only in patients younger than 14 years, while not in adult patients. In multivariate analysis, only clinical stage was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Expressions of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (BCL-2) correlated with the expression of ALK, but they did not have prognostic significance. High Ki-67 expression was also a poor prognostic factor.;Our results show that ALK expression alone is not sufficient to determine the outcome of ALCL and other prognostic factors must be considered.

To identify new locations of ALCL-related oncogenes, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was applied to three ALCL cell lines (SU-DHL-1, Karpas 299, and DEL) exhibiting the 5q35 bp and expressing the NPM/ALK transcript. The CGH profiles were compared with those obtained with DNA from U937, HL-60 cells, and altered lymph nodes from two children with ALCL. Significant DNA copy number gains and/or losses were observed on several chromosomes in all ALCL cell lines. Distinct amplicons were detected on 1q21 approximately q44 (DEL), 7q12 (SU-DHL-1), and 1q12 approximately q22 (Karpas 299) regions. The NPM/ALK fusion gene was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in more than 80% of interphase nuclei and metaphase spreads. Enhanced expression of TGF-beta2 and c-MET candidate genes located at the amplified regions was revealed in DEL and SU-DHL1 cell lines by Northern blot analysis.

Essential defining features comprise of a proliferation of large lymphoid cells with strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 and a characteristic growth pattern. Using molecular and clinical criteria three entities of ALC-lymphoma have been identified: primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALC-lymphoma, primary systemic ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma and primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma. The ALK expression in the primary systemic ALC-lymphoma entity is caused by chromosomal translocations, most commonly t(2;5), and can nowadays be reliably detected by immuno-histology. ALK-positive ALC-lymphoma predominantly affects young male patients and if treated with chemotherapy has a favourable prognosis. They show a broad morphological spectrum, with the \"common type\", the small cell variant and the lymphohistiocytic variant being most commonly observed. The knowledge of the existence of these variants is essential in establishing the correct diagnosis. ALK-negative ALC-lymphomas occur in older patients, equally affecting both genders and have an unfavorable prognosis. The morphology and the immuno-phenotype of primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma shows an overlap with that of lymphomatoid papulosis. Both diseases have an excellent prognosis and secondary systemic dissemination is only rarely observed. The ALC-lymphomas described above derive from T cells and are generally accepted as biological entities. In contrast, large B-cell-lymphomas with anaplastic morphology are now believed not to represent an own entity but a morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Malignant lymphomas with morphological features of both Hodgkin- and ALC-lymphoma have formerly been classified as ALCL Hodgkin-like. Recent immuno-histological analysis of these cases however suggests that ALCL Hodgkin-like does not represent an own lymphoma entity. Most of these cases are likely to be examples of tumor cell rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while a minority of these cases appear to fall either into the category of ALK-positive or ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma.",

Probes for the identification of mRNAs containing (Bplus) and lacking (Bdel) exons 7 and 8 of the hTERT mRNA were used. Normal lymphocyte populations equally expressed both Bplus and Bdel mRNAs. Although all ALCL examined were found positive for hTERT expression with RT-PCR, hTERT mRNAs were identified in 68% of these tumors with ISH, with a higher incidence in the group bearing ALK translocations (10 out of 11; 90.9%) compared to the ALK negative group (17 out of 27; 59.3%) (PPearson's = 0.002).

Here we show using an integrated phosphoproteomic and metabolomic strategy that NPM-ALK induces a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis, increased lactate production, and biomass production. The metabolic shift is mediated through the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) phosphorylation of the tumor-specific isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) at Y105, resulting in decreased enzymatic activity. Small molecule activation of PKM2 or expression of Y105F PKM2 mutant leads to reversal of the metabolic switch with increased oxidative phosphorylation and reduced lactate production coincident with increased cell death, decreased colony formation, and reduced tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model. This study provides comprehensive profiling of the phosphoproteomic and metabolomic consequences of NPM-ALK expression and reveals a novel role of ALK in the regulation of multiple components of cellular metabolism. Our studies show that PKM2 is a novel substrate of ALK and plays a critical role in mediating the metabolic shift toward biomass production and tumorigenesis. ",

The genes involved are nucleophosmin (NPM) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the resulting chimeric NPM-ALK protein is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of t(2;5) positive ALCL. Few data on bone marrow (BM) involvement in ALCL have been published and they mostly rely on morphological examination of BM smears. We studied 52 ALCL for NPM-ALK expression by RT-PCR: 47/52 biopsies were positive. In 41 of the 47 cases we obtained the BM at diagnosis and investigated the prevalence of minimal BM infiltration by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. Minimal disseminated disease was positive in 25/41 patients (61%), of whom six had morphologically infiltrated BM. Survival analysis demonstrated a 5-year progression-free survival of 41 +/- 11% for patients with molecularly positive BM vs 100% for patients with negative BM (P = 0.001). These results suggest that minimal BM involvement at diagnosis is a common event in pediatric ALCL and that minimal BM disease monitoring could identify patients at risk of relapse.",

The proliferation and survival of ALCL cells are determined by the ALK activity. Here we show that the kinase activity of the nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion regulated the shape of ALCL cells and F-actin filament assembly in a pattern similar to T-cell receptor-stimulated cells. NPM-ALK formed a complex with the guanine exchange factor VAV1, enhancing its activation through phosphorylation. VAV1 increased Cdc42 activity, and in turn, Cdc42 regulated the shape and migration of ALCL cells. In vitro knockdown of VAV1 or Cdc42 by short hairpin RNA, as well as pharmacologic inhibition of Cdc42 activity by secramine, resulted in a cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of ALCL cells. Importantly, the concomitant inhibition of Cdc42 and NPM-ALK kinase acted synergistically to induce apoptosis of ALCL cells. Finally, Cdc42 was necessary for the growth as well as for the maintenance of already established lymphomas in vivo. Thus, our data open perspectives for new therapeutic strategies by revealing a mechanism of regulation of ALCL cell growth through Cdc42.",

Histologically, there was an infiltrate consisting of atypical large lymphocytes and small lymphocytes in the dermis and fat tissue. Southern blot analysis showed monoclonal T-cell receptor Cbeta1 gene rearrangement. Atypical large lymphocytes were positive for CD30, CD4 and CD25, and negative for CD3 and CD79a. They were also positive for ALK only in the cytoplasm, and neurophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion transcript was not detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This suggested that the translocation partner of the ALK gene in this case was different from NPM (variant translocation). The tumour on the forehead resolved in 1 month after biopsy. Nodular lesions recurred on the right knee, and were histologically identical with the forehead lesion.

We examined B7-H1 expression in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and found that it was constitutively expressed in both clinical samples and cell lines. In anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK(+)) ALCL cells, B7-H1 expression was suppressed by the blocking of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and upregulated by the augmentation of ERK activity by phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate stimulation, suggesting that B7-H1 expression is regulated by ERK signaling pathway in ALCL. ERK is one of the downstream mediators of nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK signaling in ALK(+)ALCL, and pharmacological inhibition of ALK was shown to dephosphorylate ERK and down-regulate B7-H1. The involvement of NPM/ALK in B7-H1 expression was also demonstrated by introducing the construct into human non-ALCL lymphoid cell lines, which resulted in B7-H1 expression. In the case of HL, B7-H1 expression was shown to be dependent on the ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. These results suggest that B7-H1 expression is controlled by common ERK signaling pathways in ALCL and HL cells.

In this study, we investigated the cellular, biologic, and proteomic changes occurring in ALK-positive ALCL cells in response to GA treatment. GA induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, quantitative proteomic changes analyzed by cleavable isotope-coded affinity tag-LC-MS/MS (cICAT-LC-MS/MS) identified 176 differentially expressed proteins. Out of these, 49 were upregulated 1.5-fold or greater and 70 were downregulated 1.5-fold or greater in GA-treated cells. Analysis of biological functions of differentially expressed proteins revealed diverse changes, including induction of proteins involved in the 26S proteasome as well as downregulation of proteins involved in signal transduction and protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed changes in MAPK, WNT, NF-kappaB, TGFbeta, PPAR, and integrin signaling components.

ALK protein expression leads to activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is more commonly expressed in ALK-positive than in ALK-negative tumours. Activated STAT3 leads to the induction of several genes such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1. In this study, we analysed TIMP-1 expression in five ALCL cell lines and 11 tumours by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We identified high-level TIMP-1 expression by RT-PCR in three ALK-positive ALCL-derived cell lines and in all ALK-positive ALCLs, whereas ALK-negative ALCLs generally demonstrated a lower level of TIMP-1 expression. Concordant with these results, we observed TIMP-1 immunostaining in all ALK-positive ALCLs and in only two of six ALK-negative ALCLs. No relationship was observed between the levels of ALK and TIMP-1 expression in the ALK-positive tumours. STAT3 expression levels were similar in all ALCL samples. Double staining with either CD30 or CD68 demonstrated that TIMP-1 expression was restricted to macrophages in the majority of TIMP-1-positive tumours. Expression of the TIMP-1 substrate MMP-2 was more prominent in ALK-negative tumours, while MMP-9 levels were low in all cases. Expression levels of IL-6 and TGF-beta1, which are cytokines known to induce TIMP-1, were higher in ALK-negative ALCLs and moderate in ALK-positive tumours. No clear relationship was observed between IL-10 expression and ALK positivity. Overall, no correlation was seen in ALCLs between the expression of TIMP-1 and that of cytokines that induce TIMP-1. Lack of TIMP-1 expression in the tumour cells of ALK-positive ALCLs argues against a direct role for ALK-induced activation of STAT3 in the regulation of TIMP-1 expression in ALCL.",

A comprehensive review of the 71 reported cases of breast implant associated ALCL (iALCL) is presented indicating the apparent risk factors and main characteristics of this rare cancer. The average patient is 50 years of age and most cases present in the capsule surrounding the implant as part of the periprosthetic fluid or the capsule itself on average at 10 years post-surgery suggesting that iALCL is a late complication. The absolute risk is low ranging from 1:500,000 to 1:3,000,000 patients with breast implants per year. The majority of cases are ALK-negative, yet are associated with silicone-coated implants suggestive of the mechanism of tumorigenesis which is discussed in relation to chronic inflammation, immunogenicity of the implants and sub-clinical infection. In particular, capsulotomy alone seems to be sufficient for the treatment of many cases suggesting the implants provide the biological stimulus whereas others require further treatment including chemo- and radiotherapy although reported cases remain too low to recommend a therapeutic approach.

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) are lymphomas of T or null phenotype often associated with a chromosomal translocation, t(2;5)(p23;q35). This translocation leads to the expression of a hybrid protein consisting of the N-terminal portion of nucleophosmin (NPM) and the intracellular domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). NPM-ALK possesses a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity responsible for its oncogenic property through activation of downstream effectors such as phospholipase C gamma (PLC-gamma) and the type IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Here, we show that the Src-kinases, particularly pp60(c-src), associate with and are activated by NPM-ALK expression in various cells, and in cell lines established from patients with ALCL. The kinase activity and the tyrosine 418 of NPM-ALK are required for its association with Src-kinases. Y418F mutation of NPM-ALK impaired its association with Src-kinases and strongly reduced the proliferation rate of Ba/F3 cells. In agreement, Src-kinase inhibitors or pp60(c-src) siRNA significantly decreased the proliferation rate of NPM-ALK-positive ALCL cell lines. Moreover, using active or inactive forms of pp60(c-src) and NPM-ALK, we provide evidence that NPM-ALK is a potential substrate of pp60(c-src). Overall, our data place Src-kinases as new important downstream effectors of NPM-ALK and as attractive potential therapeutic targets for new ALCL treatment.",

In most of these tumors, the t(2;5)(p23;q35) generates the NPM-ALK fusion gene. However, several studies have now demonstrated that genes other than NPM may be fused to the ALK gene. We have recently described two different ALK rearrangements involving the TRK-fused gene (TFG) in which the same portion of ALK was fused to different length fragments of the 5' TFG region. These two rearrangements encoded chimeric proteins of 85 kd (TFG-ALK(S)) and 97 kd (TFG-ALK(L)), respectively. In this study, we have identified a new ALK rearrangement in which the catalytic domain of ALK was fused to a larger fragment of the TFG gene (TFG-ALK(XL)), encoding for a fusion protein of 113 kd. Genomic analysis of these three TFG-ALK rearrangements revealed that the TFG breakpoints occur at introns 3, 4, and 5, respectively, whereas the ALK breakpoints always occur in the same intron. No homologous regions or known recombination sequences were found in these regions. Transfection experiments using NIH-3T3 fibroblasts showed a similar transforming efficiency of TFG-ALK variants compared with NPM-ALK. In addition, in common with NPM-ALK, the TFG-ALK proteins formed stable complexes with the signaling proteins Grb2, Shc, and PLC-gamma. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the TFG may use a variety of intronic breakpoints in ALK rearrangements generating fusion proteins of different molecular weights, but with similar transforming potential than NPM-ALK.",

Similar to the nodal biopsy, the predominant cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood were small atypical lymphoid cells. The large tumor cells expressed ALK immunoreactivity with a cytoplasmic and nuclear pattern, whereas some of the small cells showed only a nuclear-restricted pattern of staining. An RT-PCR study detected the NPM-ALK chimeric product in the nodal biopsy and in a peripheral blood sample in the early phase of the disease, but it became negative in a peripheral blood sample obtained after completion of the chemotherapy treatment, suggesting that this assay may be useful in the follow-up of these patients.

The results show that in advanced-stage pediatric ALCL, although most tumors express ALK and a majority show activated STAT3, cytoplasmic localization of survivin and TIMP1 is not frequent, nor is expression of CD56.

Subsequent cDNA cloning revealed p80 to be a fusion protein of two genes, the novel tyrosine kinase gene and the nucleophosmin gene, in accordance with the sequence of the NPM/ALK gene (Morris et al.). Meanwhile, the clinicopathologic features of p80-carrying ALCLs have remained unclear. Paraffin sections of 105 cases of ALCL were immunostained using anti-p80 antibody, and 30 of them were shown to express p80. Clinicopathological comparison between p80-positive and -negative ALCLs revealed that p80-positive cases occurred in a far younger patient age group and the patients showed a far better 5-year survival rate.

Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been considered as a therapeutic target for cancer where PI3K/Akt activation is a causative factor. Genistein, a natural isoflavonoid found in soy products, has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cell lines. Here, we demonstrated that treatment of two t(2;5) ALCL cell lines, SUDHL-1 and Karpas299, with genistein induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Concurrently, these cells exhibited a decrease in Akt protein levels and subsequent downregulation of Akt activity (Akt phosphorylation). Furthermore, genistein treatment induced mitochondrial membrane potential change, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. From these results, we conclude that inhibition of the Akt signaling pathway and induction of apoptosis by genistein could be used as a new treatment modality for the prevention and/or treatment of t(2;5) ALCL and other hematopoietic malignancies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are frequently associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35). This translocation fuses the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene at 5q35, which encodes a nucleolar protein involved in shuttling ribonucleoproteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23, encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor. In this report, we describe a typical case of ALCL whose malignant cells exhibited a novel (1;2)(q25;p23) translocation. These cells expressed ALK protein, but, in contrast to t(2;5)-positive ALCL (which show cytoplasmic, nuclear, and nucleolar staining), labeling was restricted to the malignant cell cytoplasm. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique to walk on chromosome 2 from the known ALK gene across the breakpoint, we showed that the gene involved at 1q25 is TPM3, encoding a nonmuscular tropomyosin. We subsequently identified, using reverse transcription-PCR analysis of cases showing similar ALK cytoplasm-restricted staining, fusion of the ALK and TPM3 genes in 2 other cases of ALCL. The TPM3 gene has been previously found in papillary thyroid carcinomas as a fusion partner with the TRK kinase gene. We showed that TPM3 is constitutively expressed in lymphoid cell lines, suggesting that, in these t(1;2)-bearing ALCL cases, the TPM3 gene contributes an active promoter for ALK expression. Activation of the ALK catalytic domain probably results from homodimerization of the hybrid protein TPM3-ALK, through the TPM3 protein-protein interaction domain. The present cases of ALCL associated with a novel t(1;2)(q25;p23) demonstrate that at least one fusion partner other than NPM can activate the intracytoplasmic domain of the ALK kinase.",

Study of the biologic features of diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells in HD, in search of specific markers for Reed-Sternberg cells, has suggested fascin as a relatively specific and sensitive marker. We studied the frequency of fascin expression in 30 ALCLs and 34 cases of classic HD, including 17 cases of the syncytial variant. Staining with CD30 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-1 also was performed in all cases. All ALCL and HD cases showed membranous and Golgi zone CD30 positivity. Fascin stained all HD cases but also stained 67% (20/30) of the ALCLs in a cytoplasmic pattern. Fascin positivity was observed in 59% (10/17) of T-cell ALCLs and 77% (10/13) of null-cell ALCLs; ALK-1-positive ALCLs, regardless of origin, were usually fascin-positive (91% [10/11]). In conclusion, fascin shows strong positivity in all cases of classic HD but also is positive in the majority of ALCLs, including ALK-1-positive and ALK-1-negative cases. Positive staining for fascin is not useful for distinguishing ALCL from HD. In some cases, fascin negativity may help rule out classic HD.",

Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK was confirmed in nuclei of tumor cells in both ALCL and HL. CD30-ERK1/2 MAPK signals induce JunB expression, which maintains high activity of the CD30 promoter. JunB induction seems to be largely independent of nuclear factor kappaB in ALCL and HL.

At transplant, 28 patients (82.4%) were in CR, whereas 6 exhibited detectable disease. Conditioning regimens were mostly myelo-ablative (n=31).

A durable CR had been obtained in 4/6 patients after injection of donor lymphocytes (n=1) or vinblastine-corticosteroid therapy (n=3). Ten patients had died, eight due to transplant toxicity and two due to progressive disease. Allo-SCT is an efficient treatment for pediatric patients with high-risk relapsed ALK+ ALCL.

        "Doc_abstract":"In vitro studies suggest that resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis might explain poor response to therapy in fatal cases. Actual execution of apoptosis depends on proper functioning of effector caspases, particularly caspase 3, and on the expression levels of apoptosis-regulating proteins, including Bcl-2 and the recently identified granzyme B- specific protease inhibitor 9 (PI9). Thus, high levels of caspase 3 activation should reflect proper functioning of the apoptosis pathways, resulting in chemotherapy-sensitive neoplastic cells and a favorable prognosis. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying numbers of tumor cells positive for active caspase 3, Bcl-2, and PI9, respectively, in pretreatment biopsies of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) patients and by comparing these numbers with clinical outcome. Activation of caspase 3 in more than 5% of the tumor cells was strongly correlated with a highly favorable outcome. High numbers of Bcl-2- and PI9-positive tumor cells were found to predict unfavorable prognosis. This prognostic effect was strongly related to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status: ALK-positive ALCL had significantly higher levels of active caspase 3, while high expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and PI9 was almost completely restricted to ALK-negative cases. In conclusion, high numbers of active caspase 3-positive tumor cells predict a highly favorable prognosis in systemic ALCL patients. Poor prognosis is strongly related to high numbers of Bcl-2- and PI9-positive neoplastic cells. These data support the notion that a favorable response to chemotherapy depends on an intact apoptosis cascade. Moreover, these data indicate that differences in prognosis between ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL might be explained by differences in expression of apoptosis-inhibiting proteins.",

Clinicopathologic studies have shown that ALK expression in ALCL is associated with improved 5-year survival rates when compared with ALCL lacking ALK expression. This study used paraffin-embedded tissue to compare interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of t(2;5) with immunohistochemical analysis for the detection of ALK protein expression in 27 patients with CD30-positive ALCLs. ALK protein expression was detected with ALK1 antibody in 14 of the 27 patients. The neoplastic cells in 13 of these 14 lymphomas reacted with the p80NPM/ALK antibody. FISH, using a two-color ALK DNA probe, correlated 100% with the immunohistochemical results: a translocation involving the ALK gene was detected in all 14 lymphomas that reacted with anti-ALK1. RT-PCR, performed on 21 lymphomas, detected NPM-ALK mRNA in five of the lymphomas, all of which reacted with anti-ALK1 and showed ALK gene rearrangement by FISH. Lymphomas showing ALK1 reactivity occurred in a younger patient population (median age, 19.5 years) and were associated with improved 5-year survival rates (84%), as compared with lymphomas lacking ALK1 reactivity (median age, 68.0 years; 5-year survival rate, 35%; p = 0.008).

Using a new monoclonal antibody (ALK1) that recognizes the native anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein as well as the fusion product of the t(2;5)(p23;q35), nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK, we investigated for ALK expression cases diagnosed as ALCL as well as lympho-proliferative disorders possessing overlapping features with ALCL. Thirteen cases showed cytoplasmic staining of the neoplastic cells. These cases were characterized by a fairly uniform morphology and occurred in children and young adults as a systemic disease. All other cases comprising T or null ALCL (17 cases), B ALCL (8 cases), Hodgkin's disease (HD) (15 cases), HD-like ALCL (23 cases), and lymphomatoid papulosis (9 cases), were negative for ALK expression. Translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) was found by classical cytogenetics or interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in 8 of the ALK1-positive cases and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 1 other case. Two additional ALK1-positive cases with an abnormal karyotype, but without t(2;5)(p23;q35), showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis a cryptic NPM/ALK gene fusion caused by an insertion of ALK near NPM in one case and a translocation of ALK to 2q35 as a result of an indiscernible inv(2)(p23q35) in the other. The latter variant translocation points to a localization of an unknown gene at 2q35 that, like NPM, might deregulate ALK and be involved in the pathogenesis of ALCL. In summary, immunohistochemistry with ALK1 antibody allows the identification of a distinct subgroup within the ALCL of T or null phenotype that is associated with 2p23 abnormalities and lacks the marked histological pleomorphism described in ALCL in general. Whereas immunostaining is the most sensitive method to identify this group, it does not help to additionally clarify the relationship among ALCL, HD, and HD-like ALCL.",

The nanocomplexes were formulated by incorporating both ALK siRNA and a RNA-based CD30 aptamer probe onto nano-sized polyethyleneimine-citrate carriers. To minimize potential cytotoxicity, the individual components of the nanocomplexes were used at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Dynamic light scattering showed that formed nanocomplexes were ~140 nm in diameter and remained stable for more than 24 hours in culture medium. Cell binding assays revealed that CD30 aptamer probes selectively targeted nanocomplexes to ALCL cells, and confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed intracellular delivery of the nanocomplex. Cell transfection analysis showed that nanocomplexes silenced genes in an ALCL cell type-selective fashion. Moreover, exposure of ALCL cells to nanocomplexes carrying both ALK siRNAs and CD30 RNA aptamers specifically silenced ALK gene expression, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis.;Taken together, our findings indicate that this functional RNA nanocomplex is both tumor cell type-selective and cancer gene-specific for ALCL cells.",

In vitro data suggest that p27 degradation may be accelerated by the c-Jun activation domain binding protein-1 (JAB1), originally identified as a coactivator of the gene regulatory AP-1 proteins. We assessed p27 and JAB1 in systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a group of tumors in which a substantial subset overexpresses anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).;The study included 5 ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, namely Karpas 299, JB-6, SR-786, SU-DHL1, and TG-S1, and 66 ALCL tumors (24 ALK positive and 42 ALK negative). The cell lines were analyzed by Western blot methods, and the tumors were assessed immunohistochemically.;SU-DHL1 and TG-S1 cells were positive for p27 and negative for JAB1, whereas SR-786 and JB-6 cells were positive for JAB-1 but negative for p27. Karpas 299 expressed p27 at relatively low levels and JAB1 at high levels. Using a 10% cutoff, p27 was positive in 12 of 66 (18.2%) ALCL tumors (5 ALK positive and 7 ALK negative), whereas JAB1 was detected in 47 of 53 (88.7%) tumors (15 ALK positive and 32 ALK negative) assessed. p27 and JAB1 expression were inversely correlated (Spearman r = -0.27, P = 0.03). For 54 ALCL patients with complete follow-up, and in separate analyses of patients with ALK-positive or -negative tumors, p27 expression correlated with poorer prognosis.;p27 is absent or expressed at low levels in most ALCL tumors and inversely correlates with JAB1. These findings suggest that JAB1-mediated degradation of p27, allowing cell cycle progression, may play a role in the pathogenesis of ALCL.",

Because aberrant CD30 expression was also observed in the T-cell lymphoma derived from lineage-specific NPM-ALK transgenic mice, we tested the hypothesis that there might be a functional relationship between the two neoplastic-related proteins: NPM-ALK and CD30. In this study, we used the RNA interference method to modulate NPM-ALK protein expression in ALCL-derived, t(2;5)-positive Karpas 299 cells. We observed decreased CD30 expression when NPM-ALK was repressed. Further analysis suggested that JunB functioned as the mediator of NPM-ALK-derived CD30 transcriptional regulation. The NPM-ALK-repressed cells, which had low CD30 expression, were characterized with lower cell proliferation compared with cells in the control group, suggesting that altered CD30 expression may correlate to NPM-ALK-mediated tumor cell growth inhibition. Combination of NPM-ALK repression and CD30 ligand leads to significantly increased tumor cell growth inhibition compared with one method alone, suggesting its potential application for ALCL-specific cancer treatment.",

The histologic features were reviewed. Immunohistochemical study for CD30, ALK protein, epithelial membrane antigen, CD2, CD3, granzyme B and TIA-1 was carried out. In-situ hybridization for small mRNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBER) was also performed. The chromosomal abnormalities were studied by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). The differences between ALK-positive and ALK-negative cases were statistically analyzed.;There were 48 cases of ALK-positive ALCL and 18 cases of ALK-negative ALCL. The patients with ALK-positive ALCL were younger than those with ALK-negative ALCL (P < 0.05), with the median age being 18 years and 36 years, respectively. Fever, especially hyperpyrexia, was more commonly observed in ALK-positive ALCL patients than in ALK-negative ALCL patients (33 cases versus 4 cases, P < 0.05). The overall survival rate and median duration of survival in patients with ALK-positive ALCL were higher and longer than those in patients with ALK-negative ALCL (80% versus 71%; 21 months versus 12.5 months, P > 0.05). There were however no significant differences in histology between ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL. Histologically, most cases showed diffuse growth pattern. Nodular pattern was demonstrated in a minority of cases. \"Hallmark\" cells were seen in most of the ALCL cases. Focal necrosis and myxomatous stroma were identified in a few cases. Most ALK-positive cases belonged to the common variant (35 cases). A small number represented lymphohistiocytic variant (8 cases). Small cell variant and sarcomatoid subtype were found only in few cases (3 cases and 2 cases, respectively).On the other hand, common variant (17 cases) constituted the majority of ALK-negative ALCL. Lymphohistiocytic variant was seen in only 1 case. Immunohistochemical study showed that ALK-positive ALCL always expressed CD30 and epithelial membrane antigen. ALK-positive ALCL more often expressed epithelial membrane antigen (100% versus 72%; P < 0.05) but less so for T-cell markers (including CD2, CD3, CD43 and CD45RO). Cytotoxic molecules were more commonly expressed in ALK-positive ALCL (P > 0.05). EBER was negative in all cases studied. FISH showed that in ALK-positive ALCL, 1 case had normal ALK gene, 1 had deletion and multicopy and 2 had deletion. On the other hand, 1 case of ALK-negative ALCL had normal ALK gene.;While there are no significant morphologic differences between ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL, the clinical features, immunophenotypes and genetic features of both groups vary. These differences are helpful in guiding the differential diagnosis.",

To discover biomarkers and/or genes involved in ALK-negative ALCL pathogenesis, we applied the cancer outlier profile analysis algorithm to a gene expression profiling data set including 249 cases of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and normal T cells. Ectopic coexpression of ERBB4 and COL29A1 genes was detected in 24% of ALK-negative ALCL patients. RNA sequencing and 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends identified 2 novel ERBB4-truncated transcripts displaying intronic transcription start sites. By luciferase assays, we defined that the expression of ERBB4-aberrant transcripts is promoted by endogenous intronic long terminal repeats. ERBB4 expression was confirmed at the protein level by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Lastly, we demonstrated that ERBB4-truncated forms show oncogenic potentials and that ERBB4 pharmacologic inhibition partially controls ALCL cell growth and disease progression in an ERBB4-positive patient-derived tumorgraft model. In conclusion, we identified a new subclass of ALK-negative ALCL characterized by aberrant expression of ERBB4-truncated transcripts carrying intronic 5' untranslated regions.",

Although autologous transplant in first remission is often used, its role as consolidation therapy in first remission remains unclear and may preferentially benefit low-risk patients.

The breakpoints of the t(2;5) (p23;q35) [corrected] translocation, which is reported in about 40% of Ki-1 ALCL, have recently been cloned. They involve a novel tyrosine kinase gene, ALK, at 2p23 and the nucleophosmin gene, NPM, at 5q35. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using NPM and ALK primers consistently detects a fusion product in Ki-1 ALCL cases with the translocation. To determine if this tumor-specific genetic alteration also occurs in HD, we performed NPM-ALK RT-PCR on RNA samples extracted from 40 lymph node biopsies of HD (25 nodular sclerosis, 11 mixed cellularity, 2 lymphocyte depleted, 2 lymphocyte predominant). Using control samples, the sensitivity of the NPM-ALK RT-PCR assay was shown to be at least 1:10(4). Amplifiable template was confirmed in all samples by RT-PCR using beta-actin primers. None of the 40 cases showed the expected 177-bp RT-PCR product indicative of the translocation. We conclude that the most common primary genetic alteration in Ki-1 ALCL, the t(2;5), is absent or very infrequent in typical cases of HD.

Information on clinical findings and treatment outcome of ALK+ lymphoma is still limited, and no data are available concerning the value of the International Prognostic Index when applied to this homogeneous disease entity. To clarify these issues, a recently developed monoclonal antibody ALKc (directed against the cytoplasmic portion of ALK) was used to detect expression of the ALK protein in paraffin-embedded biopsies from 96 primary, systemic T/null anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, and the ALK staining pattern was correlated with morphological features, clinical findings, risk factors (as defined by the International Prognostic Index), and outcome in 78 patients (53 ALK+ and 25 ALK-). Strong cytoplasmic and/or nuclear ALK positivity was detected in 58 of 96 ALCL cases (60.4%), and it was associated with a morphological spectrum (common type, 82.7%; giant cell, 3.5%; lymphohistiocytic, 8. 6%; and small cell, 5.2%) that reflected the ratio of large anaplastic elements (usually showing cytoplasmic and nuclear ALK positivity) to small neoplastic cells (usually characterized by nucleus-restricted ALK expression). Clinically, ALK+ lymphoma mostly occurred in children and young adults (mean age, 22.01 +/- 10.87 years) with a male predominance (male/female [M/F] ratio, 3.0) that was particularly striking in the second-third decades of life (M/F ratio, 6.5) and usually presented as an aggressive, stage III-IV disease, frequently associated with systemic symptoms (75%) and extranodal involvement (60%), especially skin (21%), bone (17%), and soft tissues (17%). As compared with ALK+ lymphoma, ALK- cases occurred in older individuals (mean age, 43.33 +/- 16.15 years) and showed a lower M/F ratio (0.9) as well as lower incidence of stage III-IV disease and extranodal involvement at presentation. Overall survival of ALK+ lymphoma was far better than that of ALK- anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (71% +/- 6% v 15% +/- 11%, respectively). However, within the good prognostic category of ALK+ lymphoma, survival was 94% +/- 5% for the low/low intermediate risk group (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, 0 to 1) and 41% +/- 12% for the high/high intermediate risk group (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, >/=2). Multivariate analysis identified ALK expression and the International Prognostic Index as independent variables that were able to predict survival among T/null primary, systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Thus, we suggest that such parameters should be taken into consideration for the design of future clinical trials.",

The anaplastic cells in both the primary and recurrent lesions were positive for monoclonal antibodies CD30, CD25 and a monoclonal antibody directed against the chimeric protein p80(NPM-ALK).

PF-2341066 also potently inhibited NPM-ALK phosphorylation in Karpas299 or SU-DHL-1 ALCL cells (mean IC(50) value, 24 nmol/L). In biochemical and cellular screens, PF-2341066 was shown to be selective for c-Met and ALK at pharmacologically relevant concentrations across a panel of >120 diverse kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited cell proliferation, which was associated with G(1)-S-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in ALK-positive ALCL cells (IC(50) values, approximately 30 nmol/L) but not ALK-negative lymphoma cells. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed using terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling and Annexin V staining (IC(50) values, 25-50 nmol/L). P.o. administration of PF-2341066 to severe combined immunodeficient-Beige mice bearing Karpas299 ALCL tumor xenografts resulted in dose-dependent antitumor efficacy with complete regression of all tumors at the 100 mg/kg/d dose within 15 days of initial compound administration. A strong correlation was observed between antitumor response and inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis in tumor tissue. In addition, inhibition of key NPM-ALK signaling mediators, including phospholipase C-gamma, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and Akt by PF-2341066 were observed at concentrations or dose levels, which correlated with inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and function.

Translocations involving ALK, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene, are associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Such ALK-positive ALCLs are usually responsive to a multidrug chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). However, there is no general consensus on the optimal therapy for relapsed or refractory ALCL. We report the case of a 24-year-old male suffering from ALK-positive ALCL with an uncommon manifestation of only extranodal disease in the gastric cardia region that showed primary refractoriness to standard CHOP chemotherapy. A combination therapy consisting of the anti-CD30 drug conjugate, brentuximab vedotin, and classical lymphoma salvage regimen DHAP (cisplatin, high-dose cytarabine and dexamethasone) was administered. Following two treatment cycles in 21-day intervals, the lymphoma showed considerable regression based on imaging diagnostics and no evidence of vital lymphoma in a subsequent biopsy. We did not observe any increase in toxicity; in particular, polyneuropathy and febrile neutropenia were not observed. In summary, we report that the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin and a classical regimen used for aggressive lymphoma, DHAP, could be combined as salvage therapy in a case of refractory ALK-positive ALCL.

Previously, nucleophosmin-ALK has been shown to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector, the serine/threonine kinase AKT. In this study, we hypothesized that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which functions downstream of AKT, mediates the oncogenic effects of activated PI3K/AKT in ALK+ ALCL. Here, we provide evidence that mTOR signaling phosphoproteins, including mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1, p70S6K, and ribosomal protein S6, are highly phosphorylated in ALK+ ALCL cell lines and tumors. We also show that AKT activation contributes to mTOR phosphorylation, at least in part, as forced expression of constitutively active AKT by myristoylated AKT adenovirus results in increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream effectors. Conversely, inhibition of AKT expression or activity results in decreased mTOR phosphorylation. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K/AKT down-regulates the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. We also show that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin, as well as silencing mTOR gene product expression using mTOR-specific small interfering RNA, decreased phosphorylation of mTOR signaling proteins and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALK+ ALCL cells. Cell cycle arrest was associated with modulation of G(1)-S-phase regulators, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(waf1) and p27(kip1). Apoptosis following inhibition of mTOR expression or function was associated with down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins, including c-FLIP, MCL-1, and BCL-2. These findings suggest that the mTOR pathway contributes to nucleophosmin-ALK/PI3K/AKT-mediated tumorigenesis and that inhibition of mTOR represents a potential therapeutic strategy in ALK+ ALCL.",

Among 43 830 lymphomas registered in the French Lymphopath network since 2010, 300 breast lymphomas comprising 25 peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) were reviewed. Among PTCL, ALK-negative ALCL was the most frequent and all of them were associated with breast implants.;Since 2010, all i-ALCL cases were collected from different institutions through Lymphopath. Immuno-morphologic features, molecular data and clinical outcome of 19 i-ALCLs have been retrospectively analyzed.;The median age of the patients was 61 years and the median length between breast implant and i-ALCL was 9 years. Most implants were silicone-filled and textured. Implant removal was performed in 17 out of 19 patients with additional treatment based on mostly CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy regimens (n = 10/19) or irradiation (n = 1/19). CHOP alone or ABVD following radiation without implant removal have been given in two patients. The two clinical presentations, i.e. effusion and less frequently tumor mass correlated with distinct histopathologic features: in situ i-ALCL (anaplastic cell proliferation confined to the fibrous capsule) and infiltrative i-ALCL (pleomorphic cells massively infiltrating adjacent tissue with eosinophils and sometimes Reed-Sternberg-like cells mimicking Hodgkin lymphoma). Malignant cells were CD30-positive, showed a variable staining for EMA and were ALK negative. Most cases had a cytotoxic T-cell immunophenotype with variable T-cell antigen loss and pSTAT3 nuclear expression. T-cell receptor genes were clonally rearranged in 13 out of 13 tested cases. After 18 months of median follow-up, the 2-year overall survival for in situ and infiltrative i-ALCL was 100% and 52.5%, respectively.;In situ i-ALCLs have an indolent clinical course and generally remain free of disease after implant removal. However, infiltrative i-ALCLs could have a more aggressive clinical course that might require additional therapy to implant removal.",

Because in vitro studies showed that CCR4 expression is a marker for lymphocytes bearing a T-helper 2 (Th2) phenotype, it was suggested that expression of TARC is a new immune escape mechanism in HD. To find out whether this mechanism might also be operative in CD30+ malignant lymphomas other than HD, TARC and CCR4 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry on paraffin and frozen-tissue sections of 39 nodal CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), including 27 ALK-negative and 12 ALK-positive ALCL, 25 primary cutaneous CD30+ ALCL, including 11 patients with lymphomatoid papulosis, and 31 cases of HD. TARC was expressed by the neoplastic cells in 12/27 (44%) nodal ALK-negative ALCL and all cases of classic HD, but not in nodal ALK-positive ALCL (0/12) and only rarely in primary cutaneous CD30+ ALCL (3/25). In contrast, CCR4 was expressed by the neoplastic cells in 9/9 cutaneous CD30+ ALCL, and in 9/15 (60%) nodal ALK-negative ALCL, but only in 1/4 (25%) nodal ALK-positive ALCL and not by the H/RS cells in HD (0/8). Apart from three cases of HD showing 10 to 15% CCR4-positive lymphocytes surrounding TARC-positive H/RS cells, CCR4-positive reactive T cells were few (<5%) in all other cases studied. Our results demonstrate a differential expression of TARC and CCR4 in different types of CD30+ malignant lymphomas. The small number of CCR4-positive reactive T cells in most cases studied argues against an important role of TARC expression in the evasion of antitumor responses.",

The morphological differential diagnosis was complex because the EMA-positive immunophenotype, CD45 and CD3 negativity and the clinical manifestation simulated a transitional cell carcinoma.

T-cell receptor-gamma clonal rearrangement could be also helpful in these cases.

However, the clinicopathologic significance of identification of p80 among ALCL cases has not been completely resolved. Difficulties also exist in the histologic and immunophenotypic identification of ALCL and Hodgkin's disease (HD) as separate processes, often complicating the clinicopathologic evaluation of and therapeutic approach to these entities. In order to clarify these issues, 67 specimens of ALCL and 63 specimens of HD (31 of the nodular-sclerosing type [NS-HD] and 32 of the mixed-cellularity type [MC-HD]) were immunostained using anti-p80 antibody and other relevant markers on paraffin sections. The clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features were reviewed on the basis of p80 reactivity. The expression of p80 was detected in 43 of 67 cases of ALCL (64%), but none of HD. The p80+ ALCL cases constituted a very homogeneous group of tumors, characterized by the occurrence in a much younger group and relatively more favorable clinical course than the p80- ALCL, which were in keeping with the data previously reported. They showed virtually the identical immunophenotypic findings of p80+, CD30+, EMA+, CD15-, bcl-2-, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with T- and null-cell phenotype, and showed the distinct morphologic features, including three cases of lymphohistiocytic/small-cell variant, as follows: the indented nuclei, often termed as reniform, embryolike, and horseshoelike; multiple, irregular, but indistinct nucleoli; and few reactive cells of eosinophils and epithelioid cells. Conversely, the 24 p80- ALCL cases, in which epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and bcl-2 positivities were 33% and 55%, respectively, were heterogeneous and could be subdivided into five different categories, namely (a) 11 cases of HD-like ALCLs, (b) six cases of p80 common ALCL, (c) three cases of secondary ALCL, (d) two cases of primary cutaneous ALCL, and (e) two cases of primary classical ALCL that lacked p80 expression. This study clearly demonstrated that the immunohistochemical detection of p80 is of a crucial importance in delineating the biologically distinct entity of \"primary classical ALCL\" from various diseases that show morphologic and immunohistologic overlap, including HD and HD-like ALCL.",

Trofosfamide therapy is considered rather non-toxic with an overall response rate from 50 to 80%. Most responses are, however, partial and their duration is short. We report a patient with a very aggressive ALK + anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), relapsing shortly after high dose chemotherapy. Unrelated allogeneic transplantation was hot possible. After several radio/chemotherapy regimens trofosfamide was started as palliative treatment. This therapy resulted in a complete remission, still ongoing, 27 months after termination of intravenous cytotoxic therapy and 16 months after withdrawal of trofosfamide. Thus, in this particular case, trofosfamide turned out to be an unexpectedly effective salvage therapy for an otherwise very aggressive relapsing ALCL.",

However, the regulator(s) of RU/RR dichotomy are not identified. In this study, we aim to delineate the key regulator(s) of RU/RR dichotomy.;JASPER motif match analysis was used to identify the putative factors binding to SRR2 sequence. SRR2 probe pull-down assay and quantitate real-time PCR were performed to analyze the regulation of Sox2 transcriptional activity by MYC. Methylcellulose colony formation assay, chemoresistance to doxorubicin and mouse xenograft study were performed to investigate the biological functions of MYC. PCR array and western blotting were executed to study related signaling pathways that regulate MYC expression. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assay were initiated to evaluate the expression of MYC and its correlation with its regulator by chi-square test analysis in human primary tumor cells.;We identified MYC as a potential regulator of RU/RR dichotomy. In support of its role, MYC was highly expressed in RR cells compared to RU cells, and inhibition of MYC substantially decreased the Sox2/SRR2 binding, Sox2 transcriptional activity, chemoresistance, and methylcellulose colony formation. In contrast, enforced expression of MYC in RU cells conferred the RR phenotype. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a positive regulator of MYC, was highly active in RR but not RU cells. While inhibition of this pathway in RR cells substantially decreased MYC expression and SRR2 reporter activity, experimental activation of this pathway led to the opposite effects in RU cells. Collectively, our results support a model in which a positive feedback loop involving Wnt/β-catenin/MYC and Sox2 contributes to the RR phenotype. In a mouse xenograft model, RU cells stably transfected with MYC showed upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin/MYC/Sox2 axis and increased tumorigenecity. Correlating with these findings, there was a significant correlation between the expression of active β-catenin and MYC in ALK + ALCL primary tumor cells.;A positive feedback loop involving the Wnt/β-catenin/MYC/Sox2 axis defines a highly tumorigenic cell subset in ALK + ALCL.",

The initial transbronchial lung biopsy showed discohesive pleomorphic malignant cells in a strong inflammatory milieu reminiscent of inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). Subsequent cervical lymph node biopsy revealed a spindle cell sarcoma predominantly composed of plump spindle and oval neoplastic cells in interweaving fascicles, with sparse inflammatory infiltrates, resembling pleomorphic-storiform type of MFH. However, these tumor cells in the lung and node lesions revealed essentially similar immunohistochemical features that were positive for CD30, EMA, TIA-1, granzyme B, and fascin, but negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and T- or B-lineage-specific marker. The spindled cells stains diffuse strong positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA), along with vimentin. Further studies showed that the tumor produced large quantities of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and IL-8, which we believe may contribute to the pathogenesis of sarcomatoid transformation of this tumor, and was associated with the patient's inflammatory symptoms.

The diagnosis was made via excisional biopsy of cervical lymphadenopathy in a 20-year-old woman at 27 weeks' gestation. Involvement of the placenta was noted on gross examination after cesarean section delivery of a girl at 30 weeks' gestation. The ALCL was microscopically confined to intervillous spaces in a manner similar to previous reports of other NHLs. The immunophenotype was characteristic (CD30+, EMA+, BNH9+), and the now frequently associated t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation with this lymphoma was detected by the recently produced monoclonal antibody ALK1 against the nucleophosmin/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM/ALK) chimeric protein. Complete remission was induced in the mother after delivery. Both mother and child are healthy at 10 years' follow-up. The case is reported in light of the sparse literature on lymphomatous involvement of the placenta.",

However, the prognostic value of AKT/mTOR activation in ALCL remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim to address this question from a clinical perspective by comparing the expressions of the AKT/mTOR signaling molecules in ALCL patients and exploring the therapeutic significance of targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway in ALCL.;A cohort of 103 patients with ALCL was enrolled in the study. Expression of ALK fusion proteins and the AKT/mTOR signaling phosphoproteins was studied by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The pathogenic role of ALK fusion proteins and the therapeutic significance of targeting the ATK/mTOR signaling pathway were further investigated in vitro study with an ALK + ALCL cell line and the NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells.;ALK expression was detected in 60% of ALCLs, of which 79% exhibited the presence of NPM-ALK, whereas the remaining 21% expressed variant-ALK fusions. Phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 1 (p70S6K1) was detected in 76%, 80%, 91%, and 93% of ALCL patients, respectively. Both phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and p-mTOR were correlated to ALK expression, and p-mTOR was closely correlated to p-AKT. Both p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K1 were correlated to p-mTOR, but were not correlated to the expression of ALK and p-AKT. Clinically, ALK + ALCL occurred more commonly in younger patients, and ALK + ALCL patients had a much better prognosis than ALK-ALCL cases. However, expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, or p-p70S6K1 did not have an impact on the clinical outcome. Overexpression of NPM-ALK in a nonmalignant murine pro-B lymphoid cell line, BaF3, induced the cells to become cytokine-independent and resistant to glucocorticoids (GCs). Targeting AKT/mTOR inhibited growth and triggered the apoptotic cell death of ALK + ALCL cells and NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells, and also reversed GC resistance induced by overexpression of NPM-ALK.;Overexpression of ALK due to chromosomal translocations is seen in the majority of ALCL patients and endows them with a much better prognosis. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is highly activated in ALK + ALCL patients and targeting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway might confer a great therapeutic potential in ALCL.",

The ALK gene products were identified in paraffm sections by using a new anti-ALK (cytoplasmic portion) monoclonal antibody (ALKc) that tends to react more strongly than a previously described ALK1 antibody with the nuclei of ALK-expressing tumor cells after microwave heating in 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer, pH 8.0. The ALKc monoclonal antibody reacted selectively with 60% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases (60 of 100), which occurred mainly in the first three decades of life and consistently displayed a T/null phenotype. This group of ALK-positive tumors showed a wide morphological spectrum including cases with features of anaplastic large cell lymphoma \"common\" type (75%), \"lymphohistiocytic\" (10%), \"small cell\" (8.3%), \"giant cell\" (3.3%), and \"Hodgkin's like\" (3.3%). CD30-positive large anaplastic cells expressing the ALK protein both in the cytoplasm and nucleus represented the dominant tumor population in the common, Hodgkin's-like and giant cell types, but they were present at a smaller percentage (often with a perivascular distribution) also in cases with lymphohistiocytic and small cell features. In this study, the ALKc antibody also allowed us to identify small neoplastic cells (usually CD30 negative) with nucleus-restricted ALK positivity that were, by definition, more evident in the small cell variant but were also found in cases with lymphohistiocytic, common, and \"Hodgkin's-like\" features. These findings, which have not been previously emphasized, strongly suggest that the neoplastic lesion (the NPM-ALK gene) must be present both in the large anaplastic and small tumor cells, and that ALK-positive lymphomas lie on a spectrum, their position being defined by the ratio of small to large neoplastic cells. Notably, about 15% of all ALK-positive lymphomas (usually of the common or giant cell variant) showed a cytoplasm-restricted ALK positivity, which suggests that the ALK gene may have fused with a partner(s) other than NPM. From a diagnostic point of view, detection of the ALK protein was useful in distinguishing anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases of lymphohistiocytic and small cell variants from reactive conditions and other peripheral T-cell lymphoma subtypes, as well as for detecting a small number of tumor cells in lymphohemopoietic tissues. In conclusion, ALK positivity appears to define a clinicopathological entity with a T/null phenotype (\"ALK lymphomas\"), but one that shows a wider spectrum of morphological patterns than has been appreciated in the past.",

A characteristic chromosomal translocation has been identified in ALCL of T-or null-cell lineage which juxtaposes a novel tyrosine kinase (anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK) located at 2p23 with the nucleophosmin gene (NPM) at 5q35. A chimeric mRNA transcript is produced, and the translocation results in constitutive expression of a truncated form of the ALK protein, p80. There is controversy concerning whether or not the translocation occurs in Hodgkin's disease. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect the t(2;5)(p23;q35), and to compare the results with conventional cytogenetics, reverse-transcriptase PCR and immunostaining for the p80 protein.;Twenty-five cases of malignant lymphoma (11 ALCL and 14 HD) were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the diagnosis and for analysis of p80 expression. Conventional cytogenetics were analyzed on G-banded metaphase spreads. FISH was performed using whole chromosome paints for chromosomes 2 and 5 on metaphase spreads and YAC probes for interphase nuclei. Reverse-transcriptase PCR using primers for ALK and NPM was used to amplify the translocation breakpoint in extracted mRNA.;Among 11 cases of ALCL examined by FISH, the translocation was detected in 4. Two of these cases also had RT-PCR and p80 staining performed, with positive results. Among 7 cases where the t(2;5) was not detected by FISH, 3 cases were examined by RT-PCR with negative results and 4 cases by p80 staining, also negative. The RT-PCR was negative in all 14 cases of Hodgkin's disease, 4 of which were also examined by FISH and found to be negative.;Fluorescent in situ hybridization is a useful method for detection of the t(2;5)(p23;q35) in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. The results concur with those of RT-PCR for the chimeric transcript and immunostaining for the p80 protein. The frequency with which the translocation was found was 36% in this small series, and no evidence of the translocation was found in cases of Hodgkin's disease.",

Morphology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular genetics which demonstrated the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from the t(2;5)(p23;q35), confirmed the identity of the xenograft with the original tumor. The tumor produced transcripts for interleukin-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma which could explain the patient's B-symptoms. Treatment of mice with monoclonal antibody (HeFi-1) which activates CD30 antigen administered on day 1 after tumor transplantation prevented tumor growth. Treatment with HeFi-1 after tumors had reached a 0.2 cm(3) volume caused tumor growth arrest and prevention of tumor dissemination.

The absence of the NPM-ALK fusion gene was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 8 cases and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in a further 2 cases. In each case, ALK staining was restricted to the cytoplasm and the N-terminus of NPM to the nucleus (contrasting with lymphomas expressing NPM-ALK in which cytoplasmic as well as nuclear labeling is seen). However, in the course of screening 53 ALK-positive lymphomas, 2 biopsies were found that had a \"cytoplasm-only\" ALK staining pattern but that nevertheless were shown to carry the (2;5) (by NPM staining and RT-PCR). The 15 cases resembled typical NPM-ALK-positive lymphomas in that all were of T or null phenotype, usually occurred in young male patients, and frequently presented with advanced disease associated with systemic symptoms and extranodal involvement. Moreover, their prognosis was excellent and indistinguishable from that of classical t(2;5)-positive tumors, but was clearly different from that of ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphomas. These results suggest that lymphomas carrying variants of the NPM-ALK fusion protein can be detected by immunostaining for ALK and NPM and also that they can be grouped with classical t(2;5)-positive tumors as a single entity (ALK-positive lymphoma or \"ALKoma\") that shows a better prognosis than ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.",

Here, we focused our attention on the anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), where the oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK, responsible for 70% to 80% of cases, represents an ideal crizotinib target.

These mutations also conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells expressing human NPM-ALK. The resistant cell populations, as well as mutated Ba/F3 cells, were characterized for sensitivity to two additional ALK inhibitors: the dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113 and NVP-TAE684.

Histologically, a population of large pleomorphic cells extensively infiltrated the lamina propria of the bladder. These cells were diffusely and strongly immunoreactive for CD30, ALK, EMA, and vimentin, but were negative for AE1/AE3, CK20, CK7, CK5/6, P63, SMA, HMB-45, pan-Melan, S-100, Myo D1, synaptophysin, CD56, desmin, CD15, CD20, Pax-5, and CD3. Few cells exhibited positive immunohistochemical staining of CD45. The patient underwent cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) regime of chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission after four cycles. This case is the tenth documented case of systemic ALCL involving urinary bladder. Due to its rarity, it is important to be aware of the features of ALCL in bladder, and make prompt and accurate diagnosis. ",

Absence of ALK expression from normal hematolymphoid cells provides a basis for the morphologic assessment of t(2;5). The distribution of the t(2;5) in ALC lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease (HD), as assayed by nonmorphologic methods, is controversial. We used in situ hybridization and/or immunohistology to show ALK gene products in 85 ALC lymphomas, 82 HD cases, 40 other lymphoproliferations, as well as in 6 HD- and 4 ALC lymphoma-derived cell lines. ALK gene products were restricted to t(2;5)-positive ALC lymphoma cell lines and tumor cells of 16 primary non-B cell, common-type ALC lymphomas. These were mainly from young patients with initial lymphonodal disease. ALK expression was not detectable in any other specimen, including all cases of HD and HD-like type ALC lymphoma as well as secondary ALC lymphomas. Full congruence was noted for labeling results obtained with both methods. In agreement with cytogenetic analyses, but at variance with recently published studies, ALK gene expression distinguishes a subset of ALC lymphomas from other CD30+ lymphomas, including HD.

All such cases result from a novel fusion created by the ALK gene on chromosome 2p23 and NPM on 5q35 or other variant translocation partners. A rare variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), originally described in 1997, was thought to overexpress full-length ALK in contrast to a chimeric protein characteristic of ALCL. However, full-length ALK protein lacks tyrosine kinase activity and thus the mechanism of oncogenesis has remained elusive. We describe 6 cases of ALK+ DLBCL characterized by a simple or complex t(2;17)(p23;q23) involving the clathrin gene (CLTC) at chromosome band 17q23 and the ALK gene at chromosome band 2p23. All cases were studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), complemented in one case with standard cytogenetic analysis, multicolor karyotyping (M-FISH), and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. These results clearly demonstrate that most cases of ALK+ DLBCL share the same mechanism of deregulated ALK expression. Moreover, these results demonstrate the presence of CLTC-ALK fusions in these tumors and extend the list of diseases associated with this genetic abnormality to include classical T-cell or null ALCL, ALK+ DLBCL, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.",

The presence of advanced chronic periodontitis and dental plaque raised suspicion for a benignancy. An excisional biopsy was performed, and large pleomorphic cells with an abundant cytoplasm, sometimes containing prominent nucleoli and \"Hallmark\" cells, were observed through hematoxylin and eosin staining. The tumor cells showed strong CD30 expression, EMA, Ki-67, and LCA, and negative stain for p80(NPM/ALK), CKAE1/AE3, CD20, CD3, CD56, and CD15. The final diagnosis was ALCL (ALK-negative). Further laboratory tests revealed positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patient was submitted to chemotherapy, but four months after diagnosis, the patient died due to pneumonia and respiratory failure. Oral anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare disorder.

Using a mass spectrometry (MS)-driven approach to identify changes in protein expression caused by the NPM/ALK fusion, we identified diverse NPM/ALK-induced changes affecting cell proliferation, ribosome synthesis, survival, apoptosis evasion, angiogenesis, and cytoarchitectural organization. MS-based findings were confirmed using Western blotting and/or immunostaining of NPM/ALK-transfected cells and ALK-deregulated lymphomas. A subset of the proteins distinguished NPM/ALK-positive ALCLs from NPM/ALK-negative ALCLs and Hodgkin lymphoma. The multiple NPM/ALK-deregulated pathways identified by MS analysis also predicted novel biologic effects of NPM/ALK expression. In this regard, we showed loss of cell adhesion as a consequence of NPM/ALK expression in a kinase-dependent manner, and sensitivity of NPM/ALK-positive ALCLs to inhibition of the RAS, p42/44ERK, and FRAP/mTOR signaling pathways. These findings reveal that the NPM/ALK alteration affects diverse cellular pathways, and provide novel insights into NPM/ALK-positive ALCL pathobiology.

To further analyse the transforming activity in an animal model, a cDNA encoding the protein product, NPM-ALK, was incorporated into a retrovirus construct and introduced into mouse bone marrow progenitors by infection. In a bone marrow gene transfer and transplantation protocol the hematopoietic compartments of lethally irradiated IL-9 transgenic mice were reconstituted with npm-alk infected progenitor cells. IL-9 transgenic mice were chosen, because IL-9, a pleiotropic T helper 2 cytokine, is expressed in most cases of human ALCL and was shown to have an oncogenic potential at least on T cells. Reconstituted mice developed NPM-ALK positive lymphomas including lymphoblastic lymphomas of T-cell type (T-LB), mature and immature plasmacytoma (PZ) and plasmoblastic/anaplastic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after 10-30 weeks. The combined overexpression of NPM-ALK and IL-9 exerts cooperative oncogenic activity in the transformation of murine lymphoid cells leading to accelerated and enhanced development of T-LB.

Clinical features combined fever (8/9), nodal and extra-nodal disease (9/9), including hepato-splenic (9/9) and lung involvement (7/9). The level of hyperleucocytosis ranged from 30 to 120 × 10(9) /l, with 12-90% of tumour cells.

In such cancers, the oncogenic activity of ALK stimulates signaling pathways that induce cell transformation and promote tumor growth. In search for common pathways activated by oncogenic ALK across different tumors types, we found that hypoxia pathways were significantly enriched in ALK-rearranged ALCL and NSCLC, as compared with other types of T-cell lymphoma or EGFR- and K-RAS-mutated NSCLC, respectively. Consistently, in both ALCL and NSCLC, we found that under hypoxic conditions, ALK directly regulated the abundance of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which are key players of the hypoxia response in normal tissues and cancers. In ALCL, the upregulation of HIF1α and HIF2α in hypoxic conditions required ALK activity and its downstream signaling proteins STAT3 and C/EBPβ. In vivo, ALK regulated VEGFA production and tumor angiogenesis in ALCL and NSCLC, and the treatment with the anti-VEGFA antibody bevacizumab strongly impaired ALCL growth in mouse xenografts. Finally, HIF2α, but not HIF1α, was required for ALCL growth in vivo whereas the growth and metastasis potential of ALK-rearranged NSCLC required both HIF1α and HIF2α. In conclusion, we uncovered an ALK-specific regulation of the hypoxia response across different ALK(+) tumor types and propose HIFs as a powerful specific therapeutic target in ALK-rearranged ALCL and NSCLC.",

ALCLs are characterized by the presence of ALK translocations. Aberrant Cyclin D1 expression seems to promote proliferation in other types of lymphoma, while a growth promoting CCND1/TACSD1(TROP2) fusion product has also been described in tumors. Herein, we investigated 44 ALCL cases for chromosome 11 and CCND1 status (by FISH), cyclin D1 mRNA expression (by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR) and Cyclin D1 protein (by immunohistochemistry with two different monoclonal antibodies), as well as for the expression of Trop-2/GA733-1 (by immunohistochemistry). Polysomy of CCND1 (11q13) and chromosome 11 was found in 15/38 evaluated cases (39.5%). This change was specific for CD30+ neoplastic cells, as shown by double fluorescent staining. Neoplastic cells in the majority of ALCL expressed cyclin D1 mRNA (29/41 [70.7%]), in association with the presence of ALK translocations (p=0.024) and systemic, rather than cutaneous disease (p=0.021). Remarkably, however, Cyclin D1 protein was not detected in neoplastic cells (0/44 cases), neither were these found positive for Trop-2. In conclusion, aberrant copies of CCND1 / chromosome 11 may be observed in ALCL, probably as a consequence of the reported ploidy changes in these tumors. ALCL may often express cyclin D1 mRNA, which, however, does not result in the production of functional Cyclin D1 protein or Trop-2, suggesting that these proteins do not play a role in the pathogenesis of ALCL.",

These studies led to the concept that NPM-ALK acts at the transcriptional level through the activation of several transcription factors downstream of many different signaling pathways including JAK3/STAT3, PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK. Nevertheless, the discovery of several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) within ALK interactome suggested an additional and complementary role of this oncogenic kinase at the post-transcriptional level. This review gives emerging views in ALK-mediated post-transcriptional regulation with a focus on RBPs that are associated with ALK. We will summarize the capacity of NPM-ALK in modulating the biological properties of RBPs and then discuss the role of cytoplasmic aggregates, called AGs for \"ALK granules\", which are observed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) expressing the ALK kinase. AGs contain polyadenylated mRNAs and numerous RBPs but are distinct from processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs), two well-known discrete cytoplasmic sites involved in mRNA fate. ",

They involve a novel tyrosine kinase gene, ALK, at 2p23 and the nucleophosmin gene, NPM, at 5q35. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with NPM and ALK primers detects a consistent fusion product in Ki-1 ALCL cases that have the translocation. In the course of a survey of 15 cases of Ki-1 ALCL, we identified a single case with a slightly smaller NPM-ALK RT-PCR product, among 12 cases positive for this fusion RNA. Sequencing of this novel NPM-ALK RT-PCR product showed an in-frame junction of NPM to ALK, 30 bases distal to the usual ALK junction site, but at the usual NPM Junction site. The predicted chimeric protein in this case is thus shorter by 10 amino acids, but the putative ALK catalytic domain remains intact. PCR with ALK primers bracketing the novel fusion point, performed on either cDNA or genomic DNA, yielded the same product, confirming that this novel ALK fusion point was located within an exon. Hybridization analysis of the genomic junction fragment isolated by long-range DNA PCR suggested that the ALK genomic breakpoint was also exonic. Cloning and sequencing of the genomic breakpoint confirmed that the break occurred within the 5' portion of the ALK exon participating in the fusion junction, 28 bases 3' to the normal ALK exon boundary, resulting in the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site two bases distal to the breakpoint. This case demonstrates that, in translocations resulting in chimeric transcripts, genomic breakpoints may rarely lie within an exon, provided that the reading frame is maintained and no domains presumed critical to tumorigenesis are deleted.",

Recently, the association between IgG4-related sclerosing disease and the risk of malignancies has been suggested. IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis with pancreatic cancer has been reported. Further, a few cases of extraocular malignant lymphoma in patients with IgG4-related sclerosing disease have also been documented. Herein, we describe the first documented case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) following IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis and cholecystitis and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A 61-year-old Japanese male, with a past history of DLBCL, was detected with swelling of the pancreas and tumorous lesions in the gallbladder. Histopathological study of the resected gallbladder specimen revealed diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with fibrosclerosis in the entire gallbladder wall. Eosinophilic infiltration and obliterative phlebitis were also noted. Immunohistochemically, many IgG4-positive plasma cells had infiltrated into the lesion, and the ratio of IgG4/IgG-positive plasma cells was 71.6%. Accordingly, a diagnosis of IgG4-related cholecystitis was made. Seven months later, he presented with a painful tumor in his left parotid gland. Histopathological study demonstrated diffuse or cohesive sheet-like proliferation of large-sized lymphoid cells with rich slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregular-shaped large nuclei. These lymphoid cells were positive for CD30, CD4, and cytotoxic markers, but negative for CD3 and ALK. Therefore, a diagnosis of ALK-negative ALCL was made. It has been suggested that the incidence of malignant lymphoma may be high in patients with IgG4-related sclerosing disease, therefore, intense medical follow-up is important in patients with this disorder.

ALK-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become important new drugs for ALK-driven lung cancer, but acquired resistance via multiple mechanisms including kinase-domain mutations eventually develops, limiting median progression-free survival to less than a year. Here we assess the impact of several kinase-domain mutations that arose during TKI resistance selections of ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines. These include novel variants with respect to ALK-fusion cancers, R1192P and T1151M, and with respect to ALCL, F1174L and I1171S. We assess the effects of these mutations on the activity of six clinical inhibitors in independent systems engineered to depend on either the ALCL fusion kinase NPM-ALK or the lung-cancer fusion kinase EML4-ALK. Our results inform treatment strategies with a likelihood of bypassing mutations when detected in resistant patient samples and highlight differences between the effects of particular mutations on the two ALK fusions.

The oncogenic tyrosine kinase nucleophosmin/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM/ALK) delivers a strong survival signal in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). Although NPM/ALK activates multiple antiapoptotic pathways, the biologic relevance and therapeutic potential of more downstream apoptotic effectors are mostly unknown. In this report, the NPM/ALK-mediated induction of Bcl-XL (but not of Bcl-2) was identified in human ALCL-derived cells. NPM/ALK kinase activity was required to promote Bcl-XL expression and its protective effect on mitochondrial homeostasis. Down-regulation of Bcl-XL significantly reduced the antiapoptotic potential of NPM/ALK in both transformed murine Ba/F3 pro-B cells and human ALCL-derived KARPAS-299 cells. To elucidate the role of Bcl-XL in vivo, Ba/F3-NPM/ALK+ cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Bcl-XL antisense transgene (pTet-ON) were injected into nude mice. Doxycycline administration prevented a fatal systemic disease in 15 of 15 intravenously injected mice and the appearance of subcutaneous tumor xenografts in 9 of 12 mice; in vivo down-regulation of Bcl-XL was also documented. Our results show a pivotal role for Bcl-XL in ALK-mediated oncogenicity; a single protein placed downstream of a known oncogene can be crucial for the survival of neoplastic cells both in vitro and in vivo. Bcl-XL deserves further investigation as a possible therapeutic target in ALK+ ALCLs.",

Recent studies with small molecule kinase inhibitors have provided solid proof-of-concept validation that inhibition of ALK is sufficient to attenuate the growth and proliferation of ALK (+) ALCL cells. In this study, several missense mutants of ALK in the phosphate anchor and gatekeeper regions were generated and their kinase activity was measured. NPM-ALK L182M, L182V, and L256M mutants displayed kinase activity in cells comparable to or higher than that of NPM-ALK wild type (WT) and rendered BaF3 cells into IL-3-independent growth, while NPM-ALK L182R, L256R, L256V, L256P, and L256Q displayed much weaker or little kinase activity in cells. Similar kinase activities were obtained with corresponding GST-ALK mutants with in vitro kinase assays. With regard to inhibitor response, NPM-ALK L182M and L182V exhibited sensitivity to a fused pyrrolocarbazole (FP)-derived ALK inhibitor comparable to that of NPM-ALK WT but were dramatically less sensitive to a diaminopyrimidine (DAP)-derived ALK inhibitor. On the other hand, NPM-ALK L256M exhibited >30-fold lower sensitivity to both FP-derived and DAP-derived ALK inhibitors. The growth inhibition and cytotoxicity of BaF3/NPM-ALK mutant cells induced by ALK inhibitors were consistent with inhibition of cellular NPM-ALK autophosphorylation. In a mouse survival model, treatment with the orally bioavailable DAP-ALK inhibitor substantially extended the survival of the mice inoculated with BaF3/NPM-ALK WT cells but not those inoculated with BaF3/NPM-ALK L256M cells. Binding of ALK inhibitors to ALK WT and mutants was analyzed using ALK homology models. In summary, several potential active ALK mutants were identified, and our data indicate that some of these mutants are resistant to select small molecule ALK inhibitors. Further characterization of these mutants may help to identify and develop potent ALK inhibitors active against both WT and resistant mutants of ALK.",

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using NPM and ALK primers detects a consistent fusion product in Ki-1 ALCL cases with the translocation, resulting from genomic breakpoints within the same respective introns of NPM and ALK. To examine the feasibility of long-range DNA PCR with the same exonic NPM and ALK primers for the detection of the genomic NPM-ALK rearrangement, we examined 20 cases of Ki-1 ALCL previously characterized by NPM-ALK RT-PCR. Ten cases were positive for the NPM-ALK fusion RNA and 10 were negative. We first confirmed that both the NPM and ALK normal introns are relatively short, approximately 1 and 2 kb, respectively, suggesting that the largest possible size for the chimeric NPM-ALK intron would be about 3 kb. All 10 cases positive by RT-PCR were also positive by long-range DNA PCR. The DNA PCR products ranged, as expected, from the sizes of the normal introns, between 0.5 and 2.5 kb. All 10 RT-PCR-negative cases were also negative by long-range DNA PCR, and control templates for RT-PCR and long-range DNA PCR were successfully amplified. Thus, we have shown that the introns involved by the NPM-ALK rearrangement seen in some Ki-1 lymphomas are relatively short, making the genomic rearrangement amenable to reliable detection by long-range DNA PCR. Furthermore, the variability observed in the sizes of chimeric introns in evidence against clustering of the genomic breakpoints within these introns.",

The NPM-ALK kinase, on dimerization, shows phosphotransferase activity and, through its interaction with various ALK-adapter proteins, induces cell transformation and increases cell proliferation in vitro. The chaperones heat shock proteins 90 (Hsp90) and 70 (Hsp70) play a critical role in the folding and maturation of several oncogenic protein kinases, and perturbation of Hsp90 structure affects the stability and degradation of Hsp90- and Hsp70-bound substrates. This process is triggered by benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics, Hsp90-binding small molecules. We have studied the effect of 17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a benzoquinone ansamycin, on NPM-ALK steady-state level in ALCL cells. Treatment with 17-AAG decreased NPM-ALK expression and phosphorylation, thus impairing its association with phospholipase C-gamma, Src homology 2 domain-containing protein (Shc), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also observed that NPM-ALK associates with Hsp90, and incubation with 17-AAG disrupts this complex without affecting Hsp90 expression. As shown previously for other Hsp90 client proteins, destabilization of the Hsp90/NPM-ALK complex induced by 17-AAG resulted in increased binding of the chimeric protein to Hsp70, which is known to affect protein degradation. Hsp/NPM-ALK complex formation appears to be independent of NPM sequences, because we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate NPM with either Hsp90 or Hsp70. Similar to NPM-ALK, the exogenously expressed variant fusion protein TPR-ALK showed decreased expression and phosphorylation after 17-AAG treatment, suggesting that the effect of 17-AAG on ALK chimeric proteins depends on the ALK portion and not on the partner protein moiety. Our data demonstrate that NPM-ALK cell content is determined by its interaction with Hsp90 and Hsp70, and suggest that the alteration of such associations can interfere with NPM-ALK function in ALCL cells.",

One of the critical issues in the development of efficient vaccination protocols is the identification of the appropriate TAAs. The TAA should be effective as a \"tumor rejection antigen\" able to induce an immune response that will affect tumor growth. A distinct pathologic entity characterized by the expression of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) protein and named \"ALKoma\" has recently emerged within the heterogeneous group of CD30+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose expression is normally restricted to a few scattered cells in the nervous system. Its pathological expression in lymphoma cells is due to a chromosomal translocation that leads to the formation of an ALK-derived oncogenic fusion proteins. ALK fusion proteins ectopically over-expressed and constitutively activated in lymphoid cells play a key role in the neoplastic transformation by the aberrant phosphorylation of intracellular substrates that likely contributes to the molecular pathogenesis of ALCL.

Approximately half of these lymphomas are associated with a typical chromosomal translocation, t(2;5)(p23;q35). Much confusion about the exact classification and clinicopathological features of this subgroup of NHL was clarified with the identification of NPM-ALK (nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase) as the oncogene created by the t(2;5) (Morris et al., 1994). With the discovery of NPM-ALK as the specific lymphoma gene mutation, this NHL subtype could be redefined on the molecular level. This achievement was enhanced by the availability of specific antibodies that recognize ALK fusion proteins in paraffin-embedded lymphoma tissues. Several excellent recent reviews have summarized the histopathological and molecular findings of ALCL and their use in the classification of this lymphoma entity (Anagnostopoulos and Stein, 2000; Benharroch et al., 1998; Drexler et al., 2000; Foss et al., 2000; Gogusev and Nezelof, 1998; Kadin and Morris, 1998; Ladanyi, 1997; Morris et al., 2001; Shiota and Mori, 1996; Skinnider et al., 1999; Stein et al., 2000). This review will focus on the molecular function and signal transduction pathways activated by ALK fusion oncogenes, with recent advances and possible clinical implications to be discussed.",

NPM-ALK triggers several signaling cascades, leading to increased cell growth, resistance to apoptosis, and changes in morphology and migration of transformed cells. To search for new NPM-ALK interacting molecules, we developed a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach in HEK293 cells expressing an inducible NPM-ALK and identified the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 as a candidate substrate. We found that NPM-ALK was able to bind Shp2 in coprecipitation experiments and to induce its phosphorylation in the tyrosine residues Y542 and Y580 both in HEK293 cells and ALCL cell lines. In primary lymphomas, antibodies against the phosphorylated tyrosine Y542 of Shp2 mainly stained ALK-positive cells. In ALCL cell lines, Shp2-constitutive phosphorylation was dependent on NPM-ALK, as it significantly decreased after short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated NPM-ALK knock down. In addition, only the constitutively active NPM-ALK, but not the kinase dead NPM-ALK(K210R), formed a complex with Shp2, Gab2, and growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2), where Grb2 bound to the phosphorylated Shp2 through its SH2 domain. Shp2 knock down by specific shRNA decreased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and of the tyrosine residue Y416 in the activation loop of Src, resulting in impaired ALCL cell proliferation and growth disadvantage. Finally, migration of ALCL cells was reduced by Shp2 shRNA. These findings show a direct involvement of Shp2 in NPM-ALK lymphomagenesis, highlighting its critical role in lymphoma cell proliferation and migration.",

We recently identified that MSH2, a key DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein integral to the suppression of tumorigenesis, is an NPM-ALK-interacting protein. In this study, we found in vitro evidence that enforced expression of NPM-ALK in HEK293 cells suppressed MMR function. Correlating with these findings, six of nine ALK(+)ALCL tumors displayed evidence of microsatellite instability, as opposed to none of the eight normal DNA control samples (P = 0.007, Student's t-test). Using co-immunoprecipitation, we found that increasing levels of NPM-ALK expression in HEK293 cells resulted in decreased levels of MSH6 bound to MSH2, whereas MSH2·NPM-ALK binding was increased. The NPM-ALK·MSH2 interaction was dependent on the activation/autophosphorylation of NPM-ALK, and the Y191 residue of NPM-ALK was a crucial site for this interaction and NPM-ALK-mediated MMR suppression. MSH2 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of NPM-ALK. Finally, NPM-ALK impeded the expected DNA damage-induced translocation of MSH2 out of the cytoplasm. To conclude, our data support a model in which the suppression of MMR by NPM-ALK is attributed to its ability to interfere with normal MSH2 biochemistry and function.",

With variable frequency ALCL bear the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation that fuses the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5q35 to a novel protein kinase gene, Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), on chromosome 2p23. We determined the frequency of this translocation with a novel DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using 0.5 microgram of genomic DNA, 5'-primers derived from the NPM gene and 3'-primers derived from the ALK gene and hybridization with internal probes. The presence of amplifiable DNA in the samples was tested with the inclusion in the PCR reaction of oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify a 3016-bp fragment from the beta-globin locus. NMP-ALK fusion amplicons were detected using DNA isolated either from all three ALCL cell lines tested, or from all four primary ALCL tumors known to contain the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation. Nested amplicons were detected by hybridization in 100% of specimens diluted 10(4)-fold and in 20% of those diluted 10(5)-fold. We subsequently examined archival genomic DNA from 20 patients with ALCL, 39 with diffuse large cell, 2 with mantle cell, 20 with peripheral T cell, 13 with low-grade NHL, 31 with Hodgkin's disease (HD), and 6 with lymphomatoid papulosis. Fusion of the NPM and ALK genes was detected in three of 18 patients with ALCL who had amplifiable DNA (17%, 95% confidence intervals 4% to 41%), but not in any patients with other NHL, HD, or lymphomatoid papulosis. The amplicon sizes were different in all cell lines and patients reflecting unique genomic DNA breakpoints. We conclude that with genomic DNA-PCR the rearrangement of the NPM and ALK loci is restricted to patients with ALCL. Further studies are needed to determine the prognostic significance of the NPM-ALK rearrangement, to determine whether its detection can aid in the differential diagnosis between ALCL. Hodgkin's disease, and lymphomatoid papulosis, and to establish the usefulness of the genomic DNA PCR in the monitoring of minimal residual disease in those patients whose tumors bear the t(2;5).",

A direct role for NPM-ALK in cellular transformation has been shown in vitro with immortalized cell lines and in vivo using retroviral transfer experiments. Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence of its oncogenic potential in T lymphocytes, which represent the most common target of ALK chimeras. Here, we describe a new mouse model of lymphomagenesis in which human NPM-ALK transcription was targeted to T cells. NPM-ALK transgenic (Tg) mice were born with the expected mendelian distribution, normal lymphoid organs, and a normal number and proportion of helper and suppressor T cells. However, after a short period of latency, all NPM-ALK Tg mice developed malignant lymphoproliferative disorders (mean survival, 18 weeks). NPM-ALK Tg thymic lymphomas displayed a T-cell phenotype characteristic of immature thymocytes and frequently coexpressed surface CD30. A subset of the NPM-ALK Tg mice also developed clonal B-cell plasma cell neoplasms. These tumors arose in peripheral lymphoid organs (plasmacytomas) or within the bone marrow and often led to peripheral neuropathies and limb paralysis.

In 70-80% of cases, the chromosomal aberration t(2;5)(p23;q35) results in the juxtaposition of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with nucleophosmin (NPM) and the subsequent expression of the NPM-ALK fusion protein. NPM-ALK is a chimeric tyrosine kinase, which induces numerous signaling pathways that drive proliferation and abrogate apoptosis. However, the mechanisms that lead to activation of downstream growth regulatory molecules have not been completely elucidated. Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screen, we identified GSK3β as a signaling mediator of NPM-ALK. Using a selective inhibitor of ALK, we demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase activity of ALK regulates the serine-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β. Expression of NPM-ALK in 293T cells led to an increase of pS(9)-GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) compared with kinase-defective K210R mutant NPM-ALK, but did not affect total GSK3β levels. Phosphorylation of pS(9)-GSK3β by NPM-ALK was mediated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. ALK inhibition resulted in degradation of GSK3β substrates Mcl-1 and CDC25A, which was recovered upon chemical inhibition of the proteasome (MG132). Furthermore, the degradation of Mcl-1 was recoverable with inhibition of GSK3β. ALK inhibition also resulted in decreased cell viability, which was rescued by GSK3β inhibition. Furthermore, stable knockdown of GSK3β conferred resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of ALK inhibition using viability and colony formation assays. pS(9)-GSK3β and CDC25A were selectively expressed in neoplastic cells of ALK+ALCL tissue biopsies, and showed a significant correlation (P<0.001). Conversely, ALK-ALCL tissue biopsies did not show significant correlation of pS(9)-GSK3β and CDC25A expression (P<0.2). Our results demonstrate that NPM-ALK regulates the phosphorylation of S(9)-GSK3β by PI3K/AKT. The subsequent inhibition of GSK3β activity results in accumulation of CDC25A and Mcl-1, which confers the advantage of growth and protection from apoptosis. These findings provide support for the role of GSK3β as a mediator of NPM-ALK oncogenesis.",

In ALCLs, dimerization of NPM-ALK leads to constitutive autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase, necessary for NPM-ALK oncogenicity. To investigate whether NPM-ALK, like other oncogenic tyrosine kinases, can inhibit drug-induced apoptosis, we permanently transfected NPM-ALK into Jurkat T-cells. As in ALCLs, NPM-ALK was expressed as a constitutively kinase-active 80 kDa protein, and could be detected by immunocytochemistry in nucleoli, nuclei and cytoplasm. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (assessed by cell morphology and annexin V-FITC binding) was significantly inhibited in two independent NPM-ALK-expressing clones (5.2+/-1.8 and 7.5+/-0.8% apoptosis), compared to control vector-transduced cells (36+/-6.7%). Similar results were observed with etoposide. In contrast, Fas-induced apoptosis was not inhibited. Cytochrome c release into the cytosol was delayed in doxorubicin-, but not anti-Fas-treated transfectant cells, indicating that apoptosis inhibition occurred upstream of mitochondrial events. Using NPM-ALK mutants, we demonstrated that inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis: (1) requires functional kinase activity, (2) does not involve phospholipase C-gamma, essential for NPM-ALK-mediated mitogenicity and (3) appears to be phosphoinositide 3-kinase independent, despite a strong Akt/PKB activation observed in wild type NPM-ALK-expressing cells.

In one case, malignant cells showed a translocation involving chromosomes 1q25 and 2p23 and were strongly positive for P80 staining. Such a result could be expected because P80 antibody detects the kinase domaine of the ALK protein encoded by chromosome 2p23. Overall 73.2% (41 of 56) of cases were found to be positive.

Despite constitutive activation of the kinase through gene alterations, such as chromosomal translocation, gene amplification or mutation, treatments with kinase inhibitors invariably lead to the development of resistance. Aiming to develop new tools for ALK targeting, we took advantage of our previous demonstration identifying ALK as a dependence receptor, implying that in the absence of ligand the kinase-inactive ALK triggers or enhances apoptosis. Here, we synthesized peptides mimicking the proapoptotic domain of ALK and investigated their biological effects on tumor cells. We found that an ALK-derived peptide of 36 amino acids (P36) was cytotoxic for ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and neuroblastoma cell lines. In contrast, ALK-negative tumor cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were insensitive to P36. The cytotoxic effect was due to caspase-dependent apoptosis and required N-myristoylation of the peptide. Two P36-derived shorter peptides as well as a cyclic peptide also induced apoptosis. Surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry analysis of P36-interacting proteins from two responsive cell lines, Cost lymphoma and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, uncovered partners that could involve p53-dependent signaling and pre-mRNA splicing. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 rescued these cells from P36-induced apoptosis. Finally, we observed that a treatment combining P36 with the ALK-specific inhibitor crizotinib resulted in additive cytotoxicity. Therefore, ALK-derived peptides could represent a novel targeted therapy for ALK-positive tumors. ",

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare T-cell lymphoma typically seen in children and young adults with the breast being one of the least common locations. There are a total of eleven cases of primary ALCL of the breast described in the literature. Eight of these cases occurred in proximity to breast implants, four in relation to silicone breast implant and three in relation to saline filled breast implant with three out of the eight implant related cases having previous history of breast cancer treated surgically. Adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy is given in only one case. Secondary hematological malignancies after breast cancer chemotherapy have been reported in literature. However in contrast to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the association between lymphoma and administration of chemotherapy has never been clearly demonstrated.;In this report we present a case of primary ALCL of the breast arising in reconstruction mammoplasty capsule of saline filled breast implant after radical mastectomy for infiltrating ductal carcinoma followed by postoperative chemotherapy twelve years ago.;Primary ALK negative ALCL arising at the site of saline filled breast implant is rare. It is still unclear whether chemotherapy and breast implantation increases risk of secondary hematological malignancies significantly. However, it is important to be aware of these complications and need for careful pathologic examination of tissue removed for implant related complications to make the correct diagnosis for further patient management and treatment.

Its most common form is a classical systemic type that involves multiple nodal and extranodal sites. In this study, morphologic, immunohistologic, and genetic studies were performed on ALCL cases in Pakistani patients. The median age of the patients in this study was 45 years (age range: 5-70 years), with a male to female ratio of 3.4:1. Thirty-seven (37) patients were diagnosed to have Ki-1 (CD30+) ALCL, which constituted 2% of all NHLs and 12.6% of all T-NHLs, over a period of 11 years (January 01, 1992-December 31, 2002). The tumors were of either T- or null-cell type with constant (100%) expression of CD30 (Ki-1). The majority of the cases (89.2%) expressed EMA, whereas 40.5% of the cases expressed either CD45 (LCA), CD45RO (UCHL1), or ALK. The mean age of ALCL patients with null-cell phenotype was 33.8 years as compared to those with T-cell phenotype having a mean age of 36.3 years. Out of the 37 cases diagnosed as ALCL, amplifiable DNA was isolated from 28 cases, which were further assessed for T-cell clonality for T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta, gamma, and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) for the FR2 and FR3 regions. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique demonstrated clonal rearrangement of the TCR beta, gamma, and IgH regions in 15 (53.6%), 11 (39.3%), and 2 (7.1%) ALCL cases, respectively, out of 28 cases. Association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was noted in seven out of 28 cases (25%) of ALCL by PCR, whereas ISH for EBV-encoded nuclear RNA-1 (EBER-1) detected the presence of EBV in two (16.7%) out of 12 cases, where one was T-cell ALCL and the other null-cell ALCL. Immunostaining for LMP-1 could not be performed, because tissue material was not available. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the prevalence of ALCL in Pakistan is comparable to that reported for some of the Asian communities and by the International Lymphoma Study Group and that EBV could be partly responsible for the pathogenesis of ALCL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The 2;5 chromosomal translocation is frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). The translocation creates a fusion gene consisting of the alk (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene and the nucelophosmin (npm) gene: the 3' half of alk derived from chromosome 2 is fused to the 5' portion of npm from chromosome 5. A recent study shows that the product of the npm-alk fusion gene is oncogenic. To help understand how the npm-alk oncogene transform cells, it is important to investigate the normal biological function of the alk gene product, ALK. Here, we show molecular cloning of cDNAs for both the human and mouse ALK proteins. The deduced amino acid sequences reveal that ALK is a novel receptor protein-tyrosine kinase having a putative transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain. These sequences are absent in the product of the transforming npm-alk gene. ALK shows the greatest sequence similarity to LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase) whose biological function is presently unknown. RNA blot hybridization analysis of various tissues reveals that the alk mRNA is dominantly detected in the brain and spinal cord. Immunoblotting with anti-ALK antibody shows that ALK is highly expressed in the neonatal brain. Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization analysis shows that the alk mRNA is dominantly expressed in neurons in specific regions of the nervous system such as the thalamus, mid-brain, olfactory bulb, and ganglia of embryonic and neonatal mice. These data suggest that ALK plays an important role(s) in the development of the brain and exerts its effects on specific neurons in the nervous system.",

The conditioning regimen was based on total body irradiation given in association with etoposide in three patients, and with thiotepa and cyclophoshamide in one patient. Graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin, a short course of methotrexate and rabbit antithymocyte globulin.;All patients had rapid engraftment within 3-4 wk for neutrophils and platelets, and achieved a stable full donor chimerism that has been maintained to the last follow-up visit. One patient later developed a restrictive pneumonopathy. This patient had been heavily pretreated during the course of the disease having suffered four relapses and had received a cumulative dose of bleomycin of 160 mg/m(2). After a follow-up of 11-42 months, all patients are alive in complete hematological and molecular remission; and three of them without any chronic GVHD.;The increasing number of volunteer bone marrow donors and the reduced toxicity of unrelated stem cell transplantation, especially in children, make this therapeutic option worth more extensive investigation in the treatment of high-risk failure ALCL, although more data is needed to evaluate the long-term benefits. In this regard, the presence of factors predictive of worst outcome such as an early relapse (within 12 months from diagnosis), a refractory or relapsing ALCL and the persistent detection on blood or bone marrow of nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein (NPM-ALK) transcript may help select the patients eligible to allogeneic related or unrelated stem cell transplantation.",

However, a small subset of cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) have been reported to either carry the t(2;5) or express ALK. In this study, we have immunohistochemically evaluated 327 cases of HD with the ALK-11 antibody. ALK-11 is a well characterized polyclonal antibody raised against an intracellular portion of the ALK protein. We detected ALK-11 immunoreactivity in 8 (2.4%) cases of HD. We further studied these positive cases with ALK-1 monoclonal antibody, which reacts with an intracellular portion of ALK, similar to ALK-11. All 8 ALK-11 positive cases were negative for ALK-1. These results indicate that rare cases of HD may react with ALK-11 antibody, similar to previous reports by others using different polyclonal anti-ALK antibodies. However, the absence of ALK-1 expression in these HD cases suggests that ALK protein is not truly present and that polyclonal anti-ALK antibodies may rarely yield non-specific cross reactivity.

Here, we report 2 cases of ALK-positive DLBCL. The 2 cases presented similar morphologic features and immunohistochemical characteristics, that is, positivity for ALK, IgA, CD138, and MUM1; weak positivity for CD30 and CD79a; and negativity for CD20. The clathrin-ALK transcript was identified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the sequence was determined by direct sequencing. Recently, the essential role of STAT3 activation as well as STAT 5 activation in nucleophosmin-ALK fusion protein-mediated lymphomagenesis was reported. However, differential effects of ALK-fusion variant proteins on proliferation, transformation, and invasion properties were reported. Thus, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of STAT 3 and STAT 5, and found highly hyperphosphorylated STAT 3 on tyrosine 705 but not STAT 5 in our 2 cases of ALK-positive DLBCL with clathrin-ALK fusion. Furthermore, STAT 5A expression was not detected in either of the ALK-positive DLBCL cases, although 11 of the 36 ALK-negative DLBCL cases revealed STAT 5A expression. Expression of the antiapoptotic proteins survivin and BCL-X(L), which were believed to be the targets of STAT 3, was investigated. However, there were no significant associations between expression of survivin or BCL-X(L) and ALK positivity among the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.

Oncogene-dependent DNA damage and activation of the ARF/p53 pathway play a central role in OIS and, accordingly, ARF and p53 are frequently mutated in human cancer. A number of leukemia/lymphoma-initiating oncogenes, however, inhibit ARF/p53 and only infrequently select for ARF or p53 mutations, suggesting the involvement of other tumor-suppressive pathways. We report that NPM-ALK, the initiating oncogene of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs), induces DNA damage and irreversibly arrests the cell cycle of primary fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors. This effect is associated with inhibition of p53 and is caused by activation of the p16INK4a/pRb tumor-suppressive pathway. Analysis of NPM-ALK lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice showed p16INK4a-dependent accumulation of senescent cells in premalignant lesions and decreased tumor latency in the absence of p16INK4a. Accordingly, human ALCLs showed no expression of either p16INK4a or pRb. Up-regulation of the histone-demethylase Jmjd3 and de-methylation at the p16INK4a promoter contributed to the effect of NPM-ALK on p16INK4a, which was transcriptionally regulated. These data demonstrate that p16INK4a/pRb may function as an alternative pathway of oncogene-induced senescence, and suggest that the reactivation of p16INK4a expression might be a novel strategy to restore the senescence program in some tumors.",

To elucidate the ALK pathways sustaining lymphomagenesis and tumor maintenance, we analyzed the tyrosine-kinase protein profiles of ALK-positive cell lines using 2 complementary proteomic-based approaches, taking advantage of a specific ALK RNA interference (RNAi) or cell-permeable inhibitors. A well-defined set of ALK-associated tyrosine phosphopeptides, including metabolic enzymes, kinases, ribosomal and cytoskeletal proteins, was identified. Validation studies confirmed that vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC) associated with nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, and their phosphorylation required ALK activity. ATIC phosphorylation was documented in cell lines and primary tumors carrying ALK proteins and other tyrosine kinases, including TPR-Met and wild type c-Met. Functional analyses revealed that ALK-mediated ATIC phosphorylation enhanced its enzymatic activity, dampening the methotrexate-mediated transformylase activity inhibition. These findings demonstrate that proteomic approaches in well-controlled experimental settings allow the definition of informative proteomic profiles and the discovery of novel ALK downstream players that contribute to the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype.

Moreover, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative ALCL clustered in a separate branch together with ALCL-like HL.

To evaluate this entity in a pediatric population, 36 cases of childhood large cell lymphoma were evaluated for abnormalities of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene that has been associated with ALCL morphology and immunophenotype. ALK abnormalities were evaluated by assay for the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation by RT-PCR and/or expression of NPM-ALK fusion protein by immunohistochemistry. Results showed 17 patients to have evidence of ALK gene expression. All of these children (mean age, 9.3 years) had tumors that were of T-cell phenotype (with the exception of a single case of null phenotype) and that expressed CD30. In contrast, 19 children with no evidence of ALK expression were older (mean, 12.7 years), and the majority (12/19) had tumors of B-cell phenotype. CD30 was also diffusely expressed in 8 of these 19 tumors. The difference in mean age between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.015). In three cases tested for both ALK and the t(2;5), ALK protein was detected in the absence of the t(2;5) translocation but no cases showed the reverse pattern, consistent with ALK fusion to genes other than NPM or activation of the ALK gene by another mechanism. These findings provide further support that ALK-positive ALCL is a distinct pathologic entity among pediatric large cell lymphomas primarily characterized by expression of T-cell markers, CD30, and EMA, and by a younger mean age.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase, which undergoes post-translational N-linked glycosylation. The catalytic domain of ALK was originally identified in the t(2;5) translocation that produces the unglycosylated oncogenic protein NPM-ALK, which occurs in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). Recently, both germline and somatic activating missense mutations of ALK have been identified in neuroblastoma (NB), a pediatric cancer arising from neural crest cells. Moreover, we previously reported that ALK expression is significantly upregulated in advanced/metastatic NB. We hypothesized that ALK function may depend on N-linked glycosylation and that disruption of this post-translational modification would impair ALK activation, regardless the presence of either gene mutations or overexpression.;We employed tunicamycin to inhibit N-linked glycosylation. The following ALK-positive NB cell lines were used: SH-SY5Y and KELLY (ALK mutation F1174L), UKF-NB3 (ALK mutation R1275Q) and NB1 (ALK amplification). As a control, we used the NB cell lines LA1-5S and NB5 (no ALK expression), and the ALCL cell line SU-DHL1 (NPM-ALK).;Tunicamycin treatment of ALK-positive NB cells resulted in a hypoglycosylated ALK band and in decreased amounts of mature full size receptor. Concomitantly, we observed a marked reduction of mature ALK phosphorylation. On the contrary, tunicamycin had no effects on NPM-ALK phosphorylation in SU-DHL1 cells. Moreover, phosphorylation levels of ALK downstream effectors (AKT, ERK1/2, STAT3) were clearly impaired only in ALK mutated/amplified NB cell lines, whereas no significant reduction was observed in both ALK-negative and NPM-ALK-positive cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of N-linked glycosylation considerably impaired cell viability only of ALK mutated/amplified NB cells. Finally, the cleavage of the Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) suggested that apoptotic pathways may be involved in cell death.;In this study we showed that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation affects ALK phosphorylation and disrupts downstream pro-survival signaling, indicating that inhibition of this post-translational modification may be a promising therapeutic approach. However, as tunicamycin is not a likely candidate for clinical use other approaches to alter N-linked glycosylation need to be explored. Future studies will assess whether the efficacy in inhibiting ALK activity might be enhanced by the combination of ALK specific small molecule and N-linked glycosylation inhibitors.",

ALK gene products, which are absent from normal lymphohaematopoietic cells, are a phenotypic marker of lymphomas carrying the t(2;5). We used in situ hybridization and immunohistology to screen 14 cutaneous ALC lymphomas, 21 cases of LyP, and one nodal ALC lymphoma associated with LyP for ALK gene products. ALK gene products were not detectable in these cases. In contrast, ALK gene products were found in a lymphonodal ALC lymphoma with subsequent extension to the skin and in t(2;5)-positive cell lines. Detection of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small nuclear transcripts (EBER), and of immunoglobulin light chain transcripts served to check for the presence of cellular RNA in the tissue sections. EBER transcripts were found in scattered reactive lymphoid cells, but not in atypical or tumour cells. ALK gene expression and EBV infection seem to be a rare finding in cutaneous ALC lymphomas and LyP. This points to a molecular aetiology of primary cutaneous ALC lymphomas and LyP distinct from that of extracutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disease.

Proteins that interact with ALK tyrosine kinase play important roles in mediating downstream cellular signals, and are potential targets for novel therapies. Using a functional proteomic approach, we determined the identity of proteins that interact with the ALK tyrosine kinase by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-ALK antibody, followed by electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A total of 46 proteins were identified as unique to the ALK immunocomplex using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, while 11 proteins were identified in the NPM immunocomplex. Previously reported proteins in the ALK signal pathway were identified including PI3-K, Jak2, Jak3, Stat3, Grb2, IRS, and PLCgamma1. More importantly, many proteins previously not recognized to be associated with NPM-ALK, but with potential NPM-ALK interacting protein domains, were identified. These include adaptor molecules (SOCS, Rho-GTPase activating protein, RAB35), kinases (MEK kinase 1 and 4, PKC, MLCK, cyclin G-associated kinase, EphA1, JNK kinase, MAP kinase 1), phosphatases (meprin, PTPK, protein phosphatase 2 subunit), and heat shock proteins (Hsp60 precursor). Proteins identified by MS were confirmed by Western blotting and reciprocal immunoprecipitation. This study demonstrates the utility of antibody immunoprecipitation and subsequent peptide identification by tandem mass spectrometry for the elucidation of ALK-binding proteins, and its potential signal transduction pathways.",

These ALK gene rearrangements are present in 3-5 % of NSCLC patients, typically younger, never or light smokers with adenocarcinomas. Crizotinib is a first-in-class ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant activity in ALK-positive NSCLC that received accelerated US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC in 2011, just 4 years after identification of ALK rearrangements in this setting. Subsequently, two phase III trials have shown crizotinib to have a tolerable toxicity profile and to be superior to standard chemotherapy for the first- or second-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive lung cancer and numerous countries have approved its use. Despite initial responses, acquired resistance to crizotinib invariably leads to disease progression. Mechanisms of resistance have been described to include ALK tyrosine kinase mutations, activation of bypass signalling pathways and pharmacokinetic failure of crizotinib. Several next-generation ALK inhibitors, including ceritinib and alectinib, are in clinical development and show efficacy in both the crizotinib naïve and crizotinib refractory settings. Ongoing clinical trials will identify the optimal strategy to incorporate these novel agents in the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.",

Similar cases have been reported in the literature. Although an increased risk of ALCL in patients with breast prostheses has been speculated, no studies have been conducted so far.;To determine whether ALCL risk is associated with breast prostheses.;A search for all patients with lymphoma in the breast diagnosed in The Netherlands between 1990 and 2006 was performed through the population-based nationwide pathology database. Subsequently, we performed an individually matched case-control study. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative risk of ALCL associated with breast prostheses.;Eleven patients with breast ALCL were identified in the registry. For each case patient with ALCL in the breast, we selected 1 to 5 controls with other lymphomas in the breast, matched on age and year of diagnosis. For all cases and controls (n = 35), pathological and clinical information was obtained with special emphasis on the presence of a breast prosthesis.;Association between breast implants and ALCL of the breast.;The 11 patients with ALCL of the breast were diagnosed between 1994 and 2006 at a median age of 40 years (range, 24-68 years). In 5 of these patients, bilateral silicone breast prostheses had been placed 1 to 23 years before diagnosis. All received prostheses for cosmetic reasons. Lymphoma classes of 35 eligible control patients were 12 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, including 1 T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma; 5 Burkitt lymphomas; 10 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type lymphoma; 3 follicular lymphomas; 3 peripheral T-cell lymphomas; and 2 indolent B-cell lymphomas, unclassified. One of 35 control patients had a breast implant placed before diagnosis of lymphoma. The odds ratio for ALCL associated with breast prostheses was 18.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-156.8).;These preliminary findings suggest an association between silicone breast prostheses and ALCL, although the absolute risk is exceedingly low due to the rare occurrence of ALCL of the breast (11 cases in The Netherlands in 17 years).

Whether these tumors represent a single entity or several, and what the exact cell origin, is controversial. Recently, granzyme B, a cytotoxic granule component, was reported in a small percentage of ALCL, suggesting that some cases may originate from cytotoxic lymphocytes. To further investigate this possibility, we performed an immunohistochemical study of 33 ALCLs of T- and null-cell type, using monoclonal antibodies to cytotoxic cell-associated antigens, including CD8, CD56, CD57, and the cytotoxic granular proteins perforin and TIA-1. In addition, CD4 expression was also evaluated. ALCL cases included 27 classical systemic forms and variants, 3 primary cutaneous (PC) forms, and 3 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated forms. Cytotoxic antigen expression was also studied in 51 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 17 large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) with anaplastic cytomorphology and/ or CD30 positivity. We found that 76% of ALCLs, representing all subtypes except the PC forms, expressed either TIA-1, perforin, or both proteins. Expression of TIA-1 and perforin were highly correlated (P < .001). On the basis of their immunophenotypic profiles, several subtypes of cytotoxic antigen positive and negative ALCL could be recognized. Fifty-five percent of ALCLs (18 of 33) displayed an immunophenotypic profile consistent with cytotoxic T cells. Six cases expressed cytotoxic granular proteins in the absence of lineage specific markers, and one case expressed both T-cell- and natural killer cell-like markers. These 7 cases (21%) were placed into a phenotypic category of cytotoxic lymphocytes of unspecified subtype. Twenty-four percent (8 cases) of ALCLs were cytotoxic granule protein negative. All but one of these displayed a T-cell phenotype. Cytotoxic granule protein expression did not correlate with the presence of the NPM-ALK fusion transcript. Only 10% of the 51 HD cases were found to be TIA-1+, and none expressed perforin. Cytotoxic antigen expression was absent in LBCL. The expression of cytotoxic granule proteins in the majority of ALCL implies a cytotoxic lymphocyte phenotype and suggests that most cases originate from lymphocytes with cytotoxic potential. Furthermore, the demonstration of cytotoxic cell related proteins may be a useful addition to the current panel of antibodies used to distinguish ALCL, HD, and anaplastic LBCL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered as part of the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. The native ALK protein is normally expressed in the developing and, at a weaker level, adult nervous system. We recently demonstrated that ALK is a novel dependence receptor. As such, in the absence of ligand, the ALK receptor is kinase inactive and its expression results in enhanced apoptosis, whereas kinase activation, due to a ligand or constitutive as in NPM-ALK, decreases apoptosis. Unligated/kinase unactivated ALK receptor facilitates apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the exposure of a proapoptotic juxta-membrane intra-cellular domain. This review summarizes the biological significance of the ALK receptor in cancer and development, in perspective with its dependence receptor function. The dual function of ALK in the physiology of development is illustrated in the visual system of Drosophila. In this part of the nervous system, ALK in the presence of ligand appears essential for axonal guidance, whereas in the absence of ligand, ALK expression can lead to developmental neuronal apoptosis. ALK is also found expressed in neural crest-derived tumors such as human neuroblastomas or glioblastomas but its role is not fully elucidated. However, an excessive or constitutive ALK tyrosine kinase activation can lead to deregulation of cell proliferation and survival, therefore to human cancers such as lymphomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Our observations could have important implications in the therapy of ALK-positive tumors harboring the chimeric or wild type ALK protein.",

We previously demonstrated that the constitutive phosphorylation of ALK chimeric proteins is sufficient to induce cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo and that ALK activity is strictly required for the survival of ALK-positive ALCL cells. To elucidate the signaling pathways required for ALK-mediated transformation and tumor maintenance, we analyzed the transcriptomes of multiple ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, abrogating their ALK-mediated signaling by inducible ALK RNA interference (RNAi) or with potent and cell-permeable ALK inhibitors. Transcripts derived from the gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis uncovered a reproducible signature, which included a novel group of ALK-regulated genes. Functional RNAi screening on a set of these ALK transcriptional targets revealed that the transcription factor C/EBPbeta and the antiapoptotic protein BCL2A1 are absolutely necessary to induce cell transformation and/or to sustain the growth and survival of ALK-positive ALCL cells. Thus, we proved that an experimentally controlled and functionally validated GEP analysis represents a powerful tool to identify novel pathogenetic networks and validate biologically suitable target genes for therapeutic interventions.",

By gene expression profiling we previously reported unsupervised clusters of peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified correlating with CD30 expression. In this work we extended the analysis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma molecular profiles to prototypical CD30(+) peripheral T-cell lymphomas (anaplastic large cell lymphomas), and validated mRNA expression profiles at the protein level. Existing transcriptomic datasets from peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified and anaplastic large cell lymphomas were reanalyzed. Twenty-one markers were selected for immunohistochemical validation on 80 peripheral T-cell lymphoma samples (not otherwise specified, CD30(+) and CD30(-); anaplastic large cell lymphomas, ALK(+) and ALK(-)), and differences between subgroups were assessed. Clinical follow-up was recorded. Compared to CD30(-) tumors, CD30(+) peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified were significantly enriched in ALK(-) anaplastic large cell lymphoma-related genes. By immunohistochemistry, CD30(+) peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified differed significantly from CD30(-) samples [down-regulated expression of T-cell receptor-associated proximal tyrosine kinases (Lck, Fyn, Itk) and of proteins involved in T-cell differentiation/activation (CD69, ICOS, CD52, NFATc2); upregulation of JunB and MUM1], while overlapping with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. CD30(-) peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified tended to have an inferior clinical outcome compared to the CD30(+) subgroups. In conclusion, we show molecular and phenotypic features common to CD30(+) peripheral T-cell lymphomas, and significant differences between CD30(-) and CD30(+) peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified, suggesting that CD30 expression might delineate two biologically distinct subgroups.

Genomic alterations in ALK, including rearrangements, point mutations, and genomic amplification, have now been identified in several malignancies, including lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), neuroblastoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and others. Importantly, ALK serves as a validated therapeutic target in these diseases. Several ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), including crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib, have been developed, and some of them have already been approved for clinical use. These ALK inhibitors have all shown remarkable clinical outcomes in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Unfortunately, as is the case for other kinase inhibitors in clinical use, sensitive tumors inevitably relapse due to acquired resistance. This review focuses on the discovery, function, and therapeutic targeting of ALK, with a particular focus on ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",

Thus, the development of ALK specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a current therapeutic challenge. Animal models are essential to assess, in vivo, the efficiency of ALK-oncogene inhibitors and to identify new and/or additional therapeutic targets in the ALK tumorigenesis pathway. Using the tetracycline system to allow conditional and concomitant TPM3-ALK and luciferase expression, we have developed a unique transplant model for bioluminescent TPM3-ALK-induced fibroblastic tumors in athymic nude mice. The reversible TPM3-ALK expression allowed us to demonstrate that this oncogene is essential for the tumor growth and its maintenance. In addition, we showed that this model could be used to precisely assess tumor growth inhibition upon ALK chemical inactivation. As proof of principle, we used the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A to inhibit ALK oncoprotein activity. As expected, herbimycin A treatment reduced tumor growth as assessed both by tumor volume measurement and bioluminescent imaging.

These tumors often exhibit a plasmablastic morphology, a finding which prompted our interest in looking for ALK fusions in plasma cell neoplasms. We studied 46 cases of extramedullary plasmacytoma by immunostaining with anti-ALK antibody and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using an ALK break-apart probe and found one case to be ALK protein-positive and demonstrated the disruption of the ALK gene in this case.

Despite considerable progress, several questions remain open regarding the pathogenesis of both ALCL subtypes. To investigate the molecular pathogenesis and to assess the relationship between the ALK(+) and ALK(-) ALCL subtypes, we performed a genome-wide DNA profiling using high-density, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays on a series of 64 cases and 7 cell lines. The commonest lesions were losses at 17p13 and at 6q21, encompassing the TP53 and PRDM1 genes, respectively. The latter gene, coding for BLIMP1, was inactivated by multiple mechanisms, more frequently, but not exclusively, in ALK(-)ALCL. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that that PRDM1 is a tumor suppressor gene in ALCL models, likely acting as an antiapoptotic agent.

Most ALK positive cases of ALCL harbor the t(2;5) translocation that leads to expression of Nucleophosmin-Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (NPM-ALK). NPM-ALK induces a variety of oncogenic signaling pathways that lead to malignant transformation of T-cells via Activator Protein-1 (AP-1), STAT3 and other (transcription) factors. In addition to the commonly known AP-1 activators Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), there are other signaling pathways, such as PI3K/mTOR/AKT, which are implicated in AP-1 activation/expression in ALCL. The AP-1 factor JUNB was shown to drive ALCL proliferation and the expression of the characteristic ALCL Ki-1 antigen, CD30. cJUN and JUNB target PDGFRB, thereby leading to tumor progression and dissemination. Furthermore, aberrant gene expression in ALCL is frequently accompanied by changes in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA methylation patterns.

In this report, we describe cases of lung cancer with concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement and identify their clinical characteristics. Non-small cell lung cancer patients with multiple molecular alterations were retrospectively analyzed from an academic referral center from 2011-2013. An additional review was conducted of reported cases with dual alterations. Four cases of NSCLC with alterations in both EGFR and ALK were identified and evaluated with 16 published cases for a total of 20 cases. The age of patients ranged from 37 to 77 years. Nine patients were never smokers. The disease control rates in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors and ALK inhibitors were 46% (6/13) and 71% (5/7), respectively. This series highlights the importance of comprehensive molecular profiling of newly diagnosed lung cancer, as NSCLC may be driven by concurrent molecular alterations. EGFR- and ALK-targeted therapies appear to have modest activity in patients with tumors possessing both alterations. Dual-altered NSCLC patients may have distinct clinical characteristics warranting further study.

This report describes three new monoclonal antibodies, two of which recognize, by Western blotting, the N-terminal portion of NPM present in the NPM-ALK fusion protein and also in two other NPM fusion proteins (NPM-RARalpha and NPM-MLF1). The third antibody recognizes the C-terminal portion (deleted in NPM-ALK) and reacts only with wild-type NPM. The three antibodies immunostain wild-type NPM (in paraffin-embedded normal tissue samples) in cell nuclei and in the cytoplasm of mitotic cells. Cerebral neurones, exceptionally, show diffuse cytoplasmic labeling. In contrast to normal tissues, the two antibodies against the N-terminal portion of NPM labeled the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells, in four ALK-positive ALCL, reflecting their reactivity with NPM-ALK fusion protein, whereas the antibody to the C-terminal NPM epitope labeled only cell nuclei. Immunocytochemical labeling with these antibodies can therefore confirm that an ALK-positive lymphoma expresses NPM-ALK (rather than a variant ALK-fusion protein) and may also provide evidence for chromosomal anomalies involving the NPM gene other than the classical (2;5) translocation.",

We report a case of aggressive anaplastic large cell lymphoma expressing the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein in a 58 year old man who had previously undergone liver transplantation. A definite diagnosis was not possible on histopathological examination. Immunostaining clearly showed a predominant population of small irregular lymphocytes, admixed with large cells strongly positive for CD30, epithelial membrane antigen, and the ALK protein. Neoplastic cells were of the T/cytotoxic phenotype. In situ hybridisation with EBV encoded early RNA probes showed only a few scattered positive non-neoplastic small lymphocytes. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor rearrangements was negative. The NPM-ALK fusion transcript associated with the t(2;5) translocation was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A review of the literature revealed 76 cases of T cell PTLD, showing a broad spectrum of morphological features and clinical behaviour. Most of these cases were EBV negative (61 of 76) and occurred after renal transplantation (48 of 76). To our knowledge, this is the first case of ALK positive lymphoma occurring in the setting of organ transplantation.

Hodgkin's disease (HD) is a malignant lymphoma characterized by large multinucleated tumour cells, Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H&RS) cells, surrounded by a dense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Our group recently demonstrated NPM/ALK fusion cDNAs by single-cell RT-PCR in < 3% of CD30+ tumour cells in 2/9 cases of HD. To further delineate the relevance of this finding for HD, we studied the occurrence of NPM/ALK fusion genes in peripheral blood cells of healthy donors by RT-PCR. NPM/ALK fusion cDNAs were found by RT-PCR in 14/29 healthy individuals and confirmed by hybridization with a breakpoint-specific oligonucleotide. Due to the low rate of NPM/ALK-positive cells in the peripheral blood of positive individuals, an assignment to a defined cellular subpopulation was not possible. We conclude that NPM/ALK fusion genes are present in peripheral blood cells of healthy donors. After t(14;18) and t(9;22), t(2;5) represents the third example of tumour-associated translocation products in blood cells of apparently healthy donors.

For the first time, we performed a proteome-wide identification of NPM-ALK-binding proteins using tandem affinity purification and a highly sensitive mass spectrometric technique. Tandem affinity purification is a recently developed method that carries a lower background and higher sensitivity compared with the conventional immunoprecipitation-based protein purification protocols. The NPM-ALK gene was cloned into an HB-tagged vector and expressed in GP293 cells. Three independent experiments were performed and the reproducibility of the data was 68%. The vast majority of the previously reported NPM-ALK-binding proteins were detected. We also identified proteins that are involved in various cellular processes that were not previously described in association with NPM-ALK, such as MCM6 and MSH2 (DNA repair), Nup98 and importin 8 (subcellular protein transport), Stim1 (calcium signaling), 82Fip (RNA regulation), and BAG2 (proteosome degradation).

Although important novel insights into the pathobiology of nodal PTCL have been gained recently from molecular profiling studies and clinico-pathological analyses, the pathogenetic molecular lesions remain to be deciphered for most entities. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) comprises CD4+ CXCL13+ neoplastic cells displaying overlapping immunophenotypical and molecular features with normal follicular helper T cells. This derivation might account for the presence of a prominent non-neoplastic component in AITL tissues and the clinical manifestations of the disease reflective of an immunological dysfunction. ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), defined by ALK gene translocation with various gene partners, is composed of CD30+ ALK+ cells with a cytotoxic phenotype and usually carries a good prognosis. ALK- ALCL, now considered as a distinct disease entity, is morphologically and immunophenotypically similar to ALK+ ALCL, except for ALK expression, but has distinctive molecular features. PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), the largest PTCL category, which is derived from activated CD4+ (or CD8+) T cells, is markedly heterogeneous, including at the molecular level.

We evaluated ALK status in NSCLC with a novel ALK mRNA test based on the break-apart FISH concept, which we called break-apart transcript (BAT) test. ALK5' and ALK3' transcript patterns were established with qPCR for ALK-expressing controls including fusion-negative neuroblastomas, as well as fusion-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas and NSCLC. The BAT test was evaluated on 271 RNA samples from routinely processed paraffin NSCLC tissues. Test results were compared with ALK FISH (n=121), immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis (n=86), and automated quantitative analysis (AQUA, n=83). On the basis of the nonoverlapping ALK BAT patterns in ALK-expressing controls (P<0.0001), 8/174 adenocarcinomas (4.6%) among 259 informative NSCLC were predicted as fusion positive. Overall concordance for paired method results was high (94.1% to 98.8%) but mainly concerned negative prediction because of the limited availability of positive-matched cases. Tumors with 100% cytoplasmic IHC staining of any intensity (n=3) were positive for AQUA, FISH, and BAT test; tumors with lower IHC positivity and different staining patterns were AQUA-negative. Upon multiple reevaluations, ALK gene status was considered as originally misinterpreted by FISH in 3/121 cases (2.5%). Tumors with >4 ALK gene copies were associated with longer overall survival upon first-line chemotherapy. In conclusion, application of the ALK BAT test on routinely processed NSCLC tissues yields the same fusion partner independent information as ALK break-apart FISH but is more robust and cost-effective. The BAT concept may be considered for the development of further drug-predictive translocation tests. ",

Twelve cases of the borderline malignant disorder lymphomatoid papulosis were also studied. Twenty seven of the 28 cases of ALK-positive ALCL showed the extensive cytoplasmic labelling for phosphotyrosine in the neoplastic cells. The remaining case containing moesin-ALK exhibited membrane-associated phosphotyrosine expression. There was no nuclear phosphotyrosine labelling in any of the ALK-positive ALCL, even though ALK was present within the cell nuclei in 23 of the tumours. Variable degrees of phosphotyrosine labelling, usually membrane-restricted, were observed in 7/40 cases of ALK-negative ALCL, 9/29 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 3/6 cases of mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, 2/7 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3/6 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified, 4/6 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 2/6 cases of follicular lymphomas and 2/12 cases of lymphomatoid papulosis studied.

Their therapeutic effect was determined in vitro by MTT assay, [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- and [(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT)-uptake, and by biochemical analysis of ALK-induced signaling. Micro-FDG- and FLT-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in immunodeficient mice bearing ALCL xenotransplants were carried out with the cell lines SUDHL-1 and Karpas299 to assess early treatment response to NVP-AUY922 or everolimus in vivo. SUDHL-1 cells showed sensitivity to both inhibitors in vitro. Importantly, we detected a significant reduction of FLT-uptake in SUDHL-1 bearing animals using both inhibitors compared with baseline as early as 5 days after initiation of targeted therapy. Immunostaining showed a decrease in Ki-67 and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 staining. In contrast, FDG-uptake did not significantly decrease at early time points. Karpas299 xenotransplants, which are resistant to NVP-AUY922 and sensitive to everolimus treatment, showed an increase of mean FLT-uptake on day 2 after administration of NVP-AUY299, but a significant reduction in FLT-uptake upon everolimus treatment.

ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase, with a single transmembrane domain, that plays an important role in development. Upon ligand binding to the extracellular domain, the receptor undergoes dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain. In recent years, ALK inhibitors have been developed for cancer treatment. These inhibitors target ALK activity and show effectiveness in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, acquired treatment resistance makes the future of this therapy unclear; new strategies are underway to overcome the limitations of current ALK inhibitors. ",

The latter differs by expression of CD15 and lack of CD45, pan-T antigens and ALK expression. We report nine cases of large cell hematopoietic neoplasms in which the neoplastic cells co-expressed CD30 and CD15, and had immunophenotypic and morphologic features of T-cell lymphoproliferative process. The average age of the CD15-positive group was 61.9 years; 6 cases occurred in men and 3 in women. The tumors were located in lymph nodes in 8 cases, and in liver in 1 case. Two cases expressed ALK protein. There were no statistically significant differences in phenotypic parameters between the CD15-positive and CD15-negative neoplasms (p>0.05). However, the CD15-positive group appeared to show a minor trend toward less positivity for EMA (44% versus 72%), ALK protein (22% versus 51%), and CD45RO (33.3% versus 83.3%, p=0.07), when compared to the typical CD15-negative neoplasms. In summary, although the co-expression of CD30 and CD15 is typical for classical HL, it may be also present in a subset of peripheral T-cell neoplasms including ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Combined and sensible use of morphology and a broad immunophenotypic panel in cases with limited material and/or those with overlapping histologic patterns will best discriminate between HL and ALCL. It is incumbent upon the pathologist to distinguish between these two clinicopathologic entities, since treatment options and clinical outcomes differ.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) are mesenchymal solid tumors that occur preferentially in children and young adults. They present as myofibroblastic cell proliferations accompanied by plasmocytes and lymphocytes. Recent cytogenetic and molecular observations showed non-random abnormalities of chromosomal band 2p23 resulting in a rearrangement of the ALK gene. This finding of a specific gene alteration suggests a neoplastic rather than a reactive inflammatory process for IMT tumorigenesis. ALK is a tyrosine kinase oncogene initially found to be rearranged in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCL). Of note, the breakpoints within ALK, and also within some of the ALK fusion gene partners, such as TPM3 or CLTC, are similar in IMT and ALCL. The consistent involvement of ALK, together with the diversity of partner genes, underlines the central role of ALK constitutive activation in IMT development, as well as the importance of homodimerization mechanisms of the chimeric fusion proteins in this activation. Immunohistochemical analyses performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections have shown positive ALK expression with cytoplasmic localization in half of the IMT cases containing the molecular ALK rearrangement. In conclusion, these novel molecular data have defined a group of IMT of neoplastic origin characterized by the presence of ALK alterations. The description of ALK gene rearrangements in IMT and ALCL is the second example, after the observation of ETV6-NTRK3 in congenital fibrosarcoma and in a case of chronic myeloid leukemia, of identical gene fusions occurring in two different cell lines: hematopoietic and mesenchymal. The search for rearrangement of ALK by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a useful complementary tool for IMT diagnosis.",

It has similarity to the insulin receptor subfamily of kinases and is emerging as having increased pathologic and potential therapeutic importance in malignant disease. This gene was originally established as being implicated in the pathogenesis of rare diseases including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) and ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, which is a subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently the number of diseases in which ALK is implicated in their pathogenesis has increased. In 2007, an inversion of chromosome 2 involving ALK and a fusion partner gene in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer was discovered. In 2008, publications emerged implicating ALK in familial and sporadic cases of neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer of the sympatho-adrenal system. Chromosomal abnormalities involving ALK are translocations, amplifications or mutations. Chromosomal translocations are the longest recognised ALK genetic abnormality. When translocations occur a fusion gene is created between ALK and a gene partner. This has been described in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma in which ALK is fused to NPM (nucleolar protein gene) and in non-small cell lung cancer where ALK is fused to EML4 (Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein 4). The most frequently described partner genes in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour are tropomyosin 3/4 (TMP3/4), however in IMTs a diversity of ALK fusion partners have been found, with the ability to homodimerise a common characteristic. Point mutations and amplification of the ALK gene occur in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Therapeutic targeting of ALK fusion genes using tyrosine kinase inhibition, vaccination using an ALK specific antigen and treatment using viral vectors for RNAi are emerging potential therapeutic possibilities.",

Immunohistochemically (IHC), the tumour cells were CD30(+), CD20(+), CD45(+), BCL-2(+), BCL-6(+), MUM1(+), Ki-67(+), CD45RO(-), CD3(-), CD10(-), CD15(-), CD56(-), EMA(-), TIA-1(-) and ALK(-).

Electron microscopically, the tumour cells were similar to large transformed lymphocytes and had circumferentially profuse microvillous projections resembling those of epithelial mesothelioma cells. In conclusion, CD30-positive MVLs are indistinguishable from ALCLs that have ultrastructural microvillous projections by morphology alone. However, the lack of EMA, TIA-1 and ALK expression in this MVL case facilitated a definite distinction from ALCLs.

In view of the possible use of imatinib as experimental therapy for patients with c-kit-positive tumors, we assessed c-kit expression in CD30+ cell lines and lymphomas. The cell lines were assessed using multiple methods (RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and Western blot). c-Kit expression was also immunohistochemically assessed in 168 CD30+ lymphomas including 87 classical Hodgkin's disease, 63 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and 15 cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. We also studied 18 cases of lymphomatoid papulosis, a CD30+ lesion closely related to cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Neither c-kit mRNA nor protein was detected in any of the cell lines assessed. Furthermore, treatment with imatinib did not inhibit proliferation of cell lines in vitro. Using immunohistochemistry, only one of 183 (0.5%) lesions was positive for c-kit, the positive case being an ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

Targeting hsp90 by the ansamycins geldanamycin and 17-allyl-amino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) promotes degradation of several proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, including oncogenic Raf, v-Src, erbB2, and BCR-ABL. We have previously shown that 17-AAG prevents hsp90/NPM-ALK complex formation and fosters NPM-ALK turnover, perhaps through its association with the hsp70 chaperone. Here, we show that inhibition of the proteasome activity by the potent and specific compound pyrazylcarbonyl-Phe-Leu-boronate (PS-341) blocks 17-AAG-induced down-regulation of NPM-ALK, which becomes detergent-insoluble and relocates into ubiquitin-rich perinuclear vesicles that represent aggregated polyubiquitinated forms of the protein. Kinase activity was not mandatory for proteasomal degradation of NPM-ALK, because kinase-defective NPM-ALK was even more rapidly degraded upon 17-AAG treatment. Prolonged exposure to the proteasome inhibitor was shown to trigger caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in proliferating ALCL cells at nanomolar concentrations. However, we verified that the accumulation of detergent-insoluble NPM-ALK in ALCL cells was not a spurious consequence of PS341-committed apoptosis, because caspase inhibitors prevented poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage whereas they did not affect partitioning of aggregated NPM-ALK. In line with these observations, the carboxyl hsp70-interacting ubiquitin ligase (CHIP), was shown to increase basal ubiquitination and turnover of NPM-ALK kinase, supporting a mechanism whereby NPM-ALK proceeds rapidly toward hsp70-assisted ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, when chaperoning activity of hsp90 is prohibited by 17-AAG.",

Recently, the t(2;5) has been cloned and described to represent fusion of the NPM gene with the ALK gene on chromosome 5. To better define the spectrum of lymphomas containing this abnormality we have analyzed 50 continuous human cell lines established from various types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ALCL and HD. In a first step, the expression of the NPM-ALK fusion gene was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In a second step, the t(2;5)-carrying cells were tested for the translation of functional chimeric mRNA into a fusion protein by immuno-staining of single cells with a polyclonal antibody. The NPM-ALK fusion transcript and the p80 protein were detected in eight of nine ALCL cell lines. We were unable to find PCR evidence for the t(2;5) in any of the non-ALCL cell lines including other CD30+ cell lines.

Data on pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of crizotinib, as well as preliminary clinical data for second-generation compounds, are reviewed. The issue of drug resistance is discussed.;Understanding the specific genetic aberration that causes cancer development and progression allows major advances in cancer therapy. Along the same way shown by imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia, compounds that selectively target ALK are bringing a revolution in the treatment of ALK-positive tumors. Crizotinib has just been approved, and new more potent ALK inhibitors will shortly follow. These molecules represent another excellent proof-of-principle for targeted therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Selective kinase inhibitors have had a substantial impact on the field of medical oncology. Whereas these agents can elicit dramatic clinical responses in some settings, their activity is generally limited to a subset of treated patients whose tumor cells harbor a specific genetic lesion. We have established an automated platform for examining the sensitivity to various molecularly targeted inhibitors across a large panel of human tumor-derived cell lines to identify additional genotype-correlated responses that may be clinically relevant. Among the inhibitors tested in a panel of 602 cell lines derived from a variety of human cancers, we found that a selective inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) potently suppressed growth of a small subset of tumor cells. This subset included lines derived from anaplastic large cell lymphomas, non-small-cell lung cancers, and neuroblastomas. ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that was first identified as part of a protein fusion derived from a chromosomal translocation detected in the majority of anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients, and has recently been implicated as an oncogene in a small fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and neuroblastomas. Significantly, sensitivity in these cell lines was well correlated with specific ALK genomic rearrangements, including chromosomal translocations and gene amplification. Moreover, in such cell lines, ALK kinase inhibition can lead to potent suppression of downstream survival signaling and an apoptotic response. These findings suggest that a subset of lung cancers, lymphomas, and neuroblastomas that harbor genomic ALK alterations may be clinically responsive to pharmacologic ALK inhibition.",

Problems with PTCL include their rarity, representing usually 10-15% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the Western Hemisphere, morphologic heterogeneity, and lack of immunophenotypic markers for clonality. Additionally, their clinical behavior is variable and may not correlate with morphology. Dr. Kinney gives a general overview of the diagnosis of PTCL and NK cell neoplasms. Emphasis will be placed on extranodal T cell and natural killer (NK) cell lymphomas such as hepatosplenic lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like lymphoma and nasal/nasal type T/NK-cell lymphoma. The use of ALK gene regulation in the classification of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is also reviewed. Dr. Loughran describes current understanding of the pathogenesis of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. The discussion focuses on LGL leukemia as an instructive model of dysregulated apoptosis causing both malignant and autoimmune disease. Current management options and mechanisms of therapeutic response are also described. Dr. Greer addresses whether PTCL should be treated differently from the more common diffuse large B cell lymphomas. He discusses the therapeutic options for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), from a conservative approach for primary cutaneous ALCL to combination chemotherapy for the highly chemosensitive ALCL expressing anaplastic lymphoma kinase. He reviews therapy options for the extranodal subtypes of PTCL by drawing from series in adults, pediatrics, dermatology, and the Far East.",

Expression of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene product has also been described as an important prognostic indicator in ALCL. ALK positive systemic nodal ALCL are associated with a good prognosis. However, primary cutaneous ALCL that are ALK negative have a better overall survival. The current study was done to see if mutated p(53) gene or ALK reactivity were poor prognostic indicators in those patients with CD 30(+) cutaneous LPD who showed progression of the disease.;Mutations of the p(53) gene and expression of the ALK gene product were analysed in 36 patients (23 of LyP and 13 of CD30(+) cutaneous ALCL).

Crizotinib (XalkoriTM), a potent ALK inhibitor, represents the current front-line treatment for ALK+ NSCLC and shows great clinical efficacy. However, resistant disease often develops after initial response. ASP3026 is a novel second-generation ALK inhibitor with activity on crizotinib-resistant ALK-L1196M gatekeeper mutant. As resistance is likely to be a relevant hurdle for any drug, we sought to determine the resistance profile of ASP3026 in the context of NPM/ALK+ ALCL. We selected six ASP3026-resistant cell lines by culturing human ALCL cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of drug. The established resistant cell lines carry several point mutations in the ALK kinase domain (G1128S, C1156F, I1171N/T, F1174I, N1178H, E1210K and C1156F/D1203N were the most frequent) that are shown to confer resistance to ASP3026 in the Ba/F3 cell model. All mutants were profiled for cross-resistance against a panel of clinically relevant inhibitors including ceritinib, alectinib, crizotinib, AP26113 and PF-06463922. Finally, a genetically heterogeneous ASP3026-resistant cell line was exposed to second-line treatment simulations with all inhibitors. The population evolved according to relative sensitivity of its mutant subclones to the various drugs. Compound PF-06463922 did not allow the outgrowth of any resistant clone, at non-toxic doses. ",

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe flanking the ALK gene at 2p23 and immunostaining for the ALK gene product, we studied formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of pulmonary IP and found a subset (33%) with 2p23 aberrations.

We performed a phase III diagnostic accuracy study to test the ability of gene expression profiles (GEPs; index test) to identify PTCL subtype.;We studied 244 PTCLs, including 158 PTCLs NOS, 63 AITLs, and 23 ALK-negative ALCLs. The GEP-based classification method was established on a support vector machine algorithm, and the reference standard was an expert pathologic diagnosis according to WHO classification.;First, we identified molecular signatures (molecular classifier [MC]) discriminating either AITL and ALK-negative ALCL from PTCL NOS in a training set. Of note, the MC was developed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and validated in both FFPE and frozen tissues. Second, we found that the overall accuracy of the MC was remarkable: 98% to 77% for AITL and 98% to 93% for ALK-negative ALCL in test and validation sets of patient cases, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the MC significantly improved the prognostic stratification of patients with PTCL. Particularly, it enhanced the distinction of ALK-negative ALCL from PTCL NOS, especially from some CD30+ PTCL NOS with uncertain morphology. Finally, MC discriminated some T-follicular helper (Tfh) PTCL NOS from AITL, providing further evidence that a group of PTCLs NOS shares a Tfh derivation with but is distinct from AITL.;Our findings support the usage of an MC as additional tool in the diagnostic workup of nodal PTCL.",

In addition, cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) were divided into classical, small cell, and primary cutaneous subtypes, and immunostaining for the anaplastic large-cell kinase (ALK) protein was performed on all cases of ALCL. Clinical features, response to therapy and survival were abstracted. Ninety-two cases of PTCL with adequate clinical information were retrieved. There were 40 cases of ALCL (30 classical, 7 small cell variant, 3 primary cutaneous), 28 PTCL, unspecified, 13 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and 11 with other entities. The patients had a median age of 48 years with a range of 6-84 and had an estimated overall survival (OS) of 49% and progression-free survival (PFS) of 22% at 5 years. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) was a significant prognostic factor for both progression-free and OS. Histology was a significant predictor of PFS with anaplastic large cell having the best prognosis. ALK expression was not associated with an improved progression-free or overall-survival in patients with systemic T-cell ALCL. In conclusion, the REAL classification describes distinct PTCL entities.

Historically, PTCL was treated like aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and to date cyclophosphamide, prednisone, vincristine, and doxorubicin (CHOP) remains the most commonly used regimen, despite disappointing results. Given the poor outcomes of PTCL patients, a number of studies have investigated the role of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) in the upfront setting, with different results. However, there are no prospective randomized trials, and the clinical benefit appears to be restricted to patients who achieve an objective response after induction chemotherapy. Nevertheless, with the exception of low-risk ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma, in light of the available data, HDT/ASCT for consolidation should be recommended for patients deemed eligible. The results of phase II trials showed that allogeneic stem cell transplantation can cure some relapsed/refractory patients, and few studies have evaluated this strategy in the frontline setting. With the availability of recently approved new drugs as well as new targeted agents under investigation, a number of ongoing studies are testing novel combinations aiming to improve rate and durability of responses to induction chemotherapy.",

The neoplastic cells resembling Reed-Sternberg cells or Hodgkin cells were mainly situated within sinusoidal spaces, which are characteristically seen in ALCL.

In January 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a possible association between breast implants and ALCL, which was likened to systemic ALCL and treated accordingly. We analyzed existing data to see if implant-associated ALCL (iALCL) may represent a distinct entity, different from aggressive ALCL. We conducted a systematic review of publications regarding ALCL and breast implantation for 1990-2012 and contacted corresponding authors to obtain long-term follow-up where available. We identified 44 unique cases of iALCL, the majority of which were associated with seroma, had an ALK(-) phenotype (97%), and had a good prognosis, different from the expected 40% 5-year survival rate of patients with ALK(-) nodal ALCL (one case remitted spontaneously following implant removal; only two deaths have been reported to the FDA or in the scientific literature since 1990). The majority of these patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone with or without radiation, but radiation alone also resulted in complete clinical responses. It appears that iALCL demonstrates a strong association with breast implants, a waxing and waning course, and an overall good prognosis, with morphology, cytokine profile, and biological behavior similar to those of primary cutaneous ALCL. Taken together, these data are suggestive that iALCL may start as a reactive process with the potential to progress and acquire an aggressive phenotype typical of its systemic counterpart. A larger analysis and prospective evaluation and follow-up of iALCL patients are necessary to definitively resolve the issue of the natural course of the disease and best therapeutic approaches for these patients.",

Immunohistological staining of routine biopsy sections for increased levels of phosphotyrosine may therefore provide a simple means of screening for tumours containing activated tyrosine kinases. In this study, monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine were used to immunostain a cell line and tumour biopsies from lymphomas known to contain the activated anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase. A range of normal and other neoplastic tissues were also immunostained for comparison. An anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell line carrying the (2;5) translocation, which creates the activated nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) tyrosine kinase, was strongly labelled. Routine tissue biopsies from five cases of ALK-positive ALCL were also strongly positive for phosphotyrosine. The characteristic granular cytoplasmic labelling pattern for phosphotyrosine observed in a B-cell lymphoma (expressing full length ALK kinase) was identical to that obtained using an ALK-specific antibody, thus confirming that labelling for phosphotyrosine in lymphoma cells reflects the presence of an activated kinase. When normal lymphoid tissues were stained, there was little or no labelling for phosphotyrosine, but stronger labelling was seen in other cells and tissues; for example, endothelial cells and some carcinoma samples. Whilst the strong labelling for phosphotyrosine observed in the lymphoma cells is due to the presence of activated ALK, the strong staining of some normal cells presumably represents physiologically active kinases and this should be taken into account when interpreting the immunostaining of non-lymphoid tumours. The simplicity of this method, however, means that it offers a new rapid approach to the screening of large numbers of tumours for the presence of aberrant tyrosine kinase activation, particularly if they arise from tissues which normally contain only background levels of phosphotyrosine.",

The clinical course is aggressive and despite multiagent chemotherapy, the median survival is about 2 years. Optimal first-line chemotherapy is not established and the role of high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support is still controversial.;To analyze the long-term outcome of PTCL patients treated with intensive first-line chemotherapy with highdose therapy and autologous transplant consolidation.;Sequential chemotherapy protocol consisting of 3 cycles of CHOEP-21-like regimen (PACEBO), 1 cycle of an ifosfamide and methotrexate-based regimen (IVAM) and a priming regimen with high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HAM).

In this study, the interactions of the three binding sites in NPM-ALK with the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of SNT-2 were analyzed. First, by isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that the phosphorylation-independent binding site in NPM-ALK interacts with the SNT-2 PTB domain more tightly than the phosphorylation-dependent binding sites. Second, the solution structure of the SNT-2 PTB domain in complex with the nonphosphorylated NPM-ALK peptide was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The NPM-ALK peptide interacts with the hydrophobic surface of the PTB domain and intermolecularly extends the PTB beta-sheet. This interaction mode is much broader and more extensive than those of the phosphorylation-dependent binding sites.

Our studies show that NPM/ALK, similar to other members of this family, activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and that this activation is essential for lymphomagenesis. NPM/ALK-mediated activation of STAT5 was demonstrated by detection of: (a) constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced DNA binding ability of STAT5 in NPM/ALK-transformed cells; and (b) NPM/ALK-dependent stimulation of STAT5-mediated transactivation of the beta-casein promoter. Retroviral infection of NPM/ALK+ cells with a dominant-negative STAT5B mutant (STAT5-DNM) inhibited the antiapoptotic activity of NPM/ALK in growth factor and serum-free medium. In addition, STAT5-DNM inhibited proliferation and diminished the clonogenic properties of NPM/ALK-positive cells. Finally, SCID mice injected with NPM/ALK+ cells infected with a virus carrying STAT5-DNM survived significantly longer than mice inoculated with NPM/ALK+ cells infected with the empty virus.

Dimerization of the ALK kinase domain leads to its autophosphorylation and constitutive activation. Activated NPM/ALK stimulates downstream survival and proliferation signaling pathways leading to malignant transformation. Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of autoactivation of the catalytic domain of ALK. Because kinases are typically regulated by autophosphorylation of their activation loops, we systematically mutated (Tyr --> Phe) three potential autophosphorylation sites contained in the \"YXXXYY\" motif of the ALK activation loop, and determined the effect of these mutations on the catalytic activity and biological function of NPM/ALK. We observed that mutation of both the second and third tyrosine residues (YFF mutant) did not affect the kinase activity or transforming ability of NPM/ALK. In contrast, mutation of the first and second (FFY), first and third (FYF), or all three (FFF) tyrosine residues impaired both kinase activity and transforming ability of NPM/ALK. Furthermore, a DFF mutant, in which the aspartic residue introduces a negative charge similar to a phosphorylated tyrosine, possessed catalytic activity similar to the YFF mutant. Together, our findings indicate that phosphorylation of the first tyrosine of the YXXXYY motif is necessary for the autoactivation of the ALK kinase domain and the transforming activity of NPM/ALK.",

In general, the ALK catalytic domain is rearranged and fused to a dimerization domain encoded by an unrelated gene. Less frequently, full-length ALK is activated by point mutations. The common theme is unregulated firing of ALK downstream signalling, leading to uncontrolled cell division and increased cell survival. ALK-driven tumors can be treated with Crizotinib, an orally available dual ALK/MET inhibitor, currently approved for advanced ALK-positive NSCLCs. Crizotinib-treated patients achieve high response rates, with an excellent toxicity profile. However, drug-resistant disease often develops, particularly in NSCLC patients. The processes leading to drug resistance include both ALK-dependent (point mutations or gene amplification), as well as ALK-independent mechanisms, which are here briefly discussed. Recently, Ceritinib has been approved for Crizotinib-refractory NSCLC, further extending patients' survival, but resistance again emerged. Novel ALK kinase inhibitors are currently under clinical development, showing great promise for improved efficacy in drug-resistance disease. It is opinion of the author that drug-resistance is likely to arise under any treatment, due to intrinsic heterogeneity and adaptability of cancer. To prevent or delay this phenomenon, we need to treat less advanced disease, with drugs that are rapidly effective in order not to allow enough time for tumor evolution, and we want to have more and more drugs with non-overlapping resistance profiles, for subsequent lines of targeted therapy. Finally, the use of drug combinations may exponentially decrease the chances of resistance. ",

These disorders comprise a spectrum of clinically benign lymphomatoidpapulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). The peak incidence of LyP is in the 5th decade of life, and the incidence of primary cutaneous ALCL peaks in the 6th decade, but children are also affected. Both LyP and primary cutaneous ALCL have an excellent prognosis. However, LyP is associated with development of malignant lymphoma (mycosis fungoides, Hodgkin lymphoma, or ALCL) in 20% of cases, and also with an increased risk of non-lymphoid cancers. The diagnosis of LyP is difficult and often delayed. Primary cutaneous ALCL must be distinguished from secondary skin lesions in systemic ALCL, which confer a poor prognosis. Correlation of clinical findings with histopathology and immunopathology (stains for ALK kinase, epithelial membrane antigen, and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen) are important to achieve a correct diagnosis. When a diagnosis of CD30+ PCLPD is established, minimal clinical staging is required. Low-dose methotrexate (10-25 mg weekly) is the most effective therapy for PCLPD but is usually reserved for aggressive cases of LyP and multifocal lesions of cutaneous ALCL Many patients with LyP can be followed expectantly, with special attention to changes in character of the skin lesions or development of lymphadenopathy. Patients with localized cutaneous ALCL can be treated with irradiation. Extracutaneous spread of disease is an indication for multiagent chemotherapy. Other treatment alternatives are discussed.",

The authors of the current study hypothesized that Id2 also is overexpressed in T-cell lymphomas.;By using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses, high Id2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, respectively, were detected in all 4 T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines that were tested.;Immunohistochemistry results indicated that Id2 was expressed strongly in 21 of 27 (78%) ALCL tumors (79% anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]-negative and 75% ALK-positive), in 5 of 10 (50%) extranodal natural killer/T (NK/T)-cell lymphomas of the nasal type, in 2 of 8 (25%) cutaneous ALCLs, in 2 of 9 (22%) enteropathy type T-cell lymphomas, in 1 of 5 (20%) peripheral T-cell lymphomas not otherwise specified, and in 1 of 8 (13%) T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias. Other types of T-cell lymphoma were negative for Id2. Because it is known that myc is expressed in ALCL, myc was inhibited selectively in 2 ALCL cell lines, resulting in a concentration-dependent decrease in Id2 mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, forced expression of myc in HEK 293T cells using an myc/green fluorescent protein adenoviral vector resulted in Id2 up-regulation.;Taken together, the current data suggest that Id2 commonly is overexpressed in highly proliferative T-cell lymphomas, and its expression may result from transcriptional activation of myc in these tumors.",

Such rearrangements juxtapose the intracellular domain of ALK to 5'-end sequences belonging to different genes and create transforming fusion proteins. To understand how the oncogenic versions of ALK contribute to lymphomagenesis, it is important to analyze the biological effects and the biochemical properties of this receptor under controlled conditions of activation. To this aim, we constructed chimeric receptor molecules in which the extracellular domain of the ALK kinase is replaced by the extracellular, ligand-binding domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Upon transfection in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the EGFR/ALK chimera was correctly synthesized and transported to the cell surface, where it was fully functional in forming high versus low affinity EGF-binding sites and transducing an EGF-dependent signal intracellularly. Overexpression of the EGFR/ALK chimera in NIH 3T3 was sufficient to induce the malignant phenotype; the appearance of the transformed phenotype was, however, conditionally dependent on the administration of EGF. Moreover, the EGFR/ALK chimera was significantly more active in inducing transformation and DNA synthesis than the wild type EGFR when either was expressed at similar levels in NIH 3T3 cells. Comparative analysis of the biochemical pathways implicated in the transduction of mitogenic signals did not show any increased ability of the EGFR/ALK to phosphorylate PLC-gamma and MAPK compared with the EGFR. On the contrary, EGFR/ALK showed to have a consistently greater effect on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity compared with the EGFR, indicating that this enzyme plays a major role in mediating the mitogenic effects of ALK in NIH 3T3 cells.",

We examined a wider variety of soft tissue tumors to further advance the survey of ALK status in mesenchymal lesions. ALK protein expression was evaluated immunohistochemically with 2 specific antibodies (ALK1 and 5A4) in 249 benign and malignant soft tissue tumors, and the expression of ALK transcripts and 8 types of ALK fusion transcripts was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 165 and 100 tumors, respectively. Moreover, ALK gene status was analyzed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 17 tumors with ALK expression. Immunohistochemically, ALK protein was detected in 69 cases (28%), including IMTs (4 of 4), rhabdomyosarcomas (4 of 7), various lipogenic tumors (35 of 65), Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (6 of 10), malignant fibrous histiocytomas (8 of 37), leiomyosarcomas (3 of 18), and other non-IMT tumors (9 of 108); however, most of these, except the IMTs, displayed merely low-level expression. Although ALK transcripts were identified in 85 (52%) of the 165 cases examined by RT-PCR, the full-length (wild-type) ALK, rather than the truncated or chimeric forms detected in IMTs, predominated in most non-IMT tumors. Except for 2 IMTs, all cases with the expression of ALK messages displayed no detectable ALK fusion transcripts. More than 67% of the cases analyzed by both RT-PCR and immunohistochemical assays demonstrated concordant results. ALK gene amplification was found in 4 non-IMT tumors (2 leiomyosarcomas and 1 case each of rhadomyosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma) analyzed by FISH, and the rearrangement of this gene was identified in 2 IMTs. The current data expands the variety of non-IMT soft tissue tumors with ALK expression, and warrants further investigation of its underlying molecular mechanisms.",

In this review, the revised points in the lymphoid neoplasms in the fourth edition were summarized from the viewpoint of doctors and medical technologists in clinical laboratories in hospitals. The diseases are classified based on information about morphology, immunophenotype, genetic features, and clinical features. B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with 7 recurrent genetic abnormalities is individually classified as a provisional entity. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is divided into two entities, ALK positive and ALK-negative. The pathogenesis of the former is involved with ALK gene rearrangement with several partner genes. Two borderline categories between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, and between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma are newly recognized as a distinct disease entity based on the overlapping morphological and genetic features. In the diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasms, understanding the morphological features is fundamental. On the other hand, the importance of immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry to clarify the immunophenotype, and chromosomal analysis and genetic examination to clarify the genetic features has been raised.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Numerous molecular abnormalities have been described in lymphomas. They are of diagnostic and prognostic value and are taken into account for the WHO classification of these tumors. They also shed some light on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in lymphomas. Overall, four types of molecular abnormalities are involved: mutations, translocations, amplifications and deletions of tumor suppressor genes. Several techniques are available to detect these molecular anomalies: conventional cytogenetic analysis, multicolor FISH, CGH array or gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays. In some lymphomas, genetic abnormalities are responsible for the expression of an abnormal protein (e.g. tyrosine-kinase, transcription factor) detectable by immunohistochemistry. In the present review, molecular abnormalities observed in the most frequent B, T or NK cell lymphomas are discussed. In the broad spectrum of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas microarray analysis shows mostly two subgroups of tumors, one with gene expression signature corresponding to germinal center B-cell-like (GCB: CD10+, BCL6 [B-Cell Lymphoma 6]+, centerine+, MUM1-) and a subgroup expressing an activated B-cell-like signature (ABC: CD10-, BCL6-, centerine-, MUM1+). Among other B-cell lymphomas with well characterized molecular abnormalies are follicular lymphoma (BCL2 deregulation), MALT lymphoma (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue) [API2-MALT1 (mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-lymphoma-translocation-gene1) fusion protein or deregulation BCL10, MALT1, FOXP1. MALT1 transcription factors], mantle cell lymphoma (cycline D1 [CCND1] overexpression) and Burkitt lymphoma (c-Myc expression). Except for ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, well characterized molecular anomalies are rare in lymphomas developed from T or NK cells. Peripheral T cell lymphomas not otherwise specified are a heterogeneous group of tumors with frequent but not recurrent molecular abnormalities. Gene profiling analysis shows that the expression of several genes is deregulated including PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) gene, encoding a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. In angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphomas molecular abnormalities are found in follicular helper T-cell (TFH) that express some distinctive markers such as CD10, PD-1, CXCR5 and the CXCL13 chemokine. ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a paradigme of T-cell lymphoma since it is associated with an X-ALK oncogenic fusion protein due to a translocation involving ALK gene at 2p23. ALK tyrosine kinase activates downstream pathways (Stat3/5b, Src kinases, PLCγ, PI3 kinase) implicated in lymphomagenesis, proliferation and protection against apoptosis. Specific ALK inhibitors are currently in clinical evaluation. Lastly several lymphomas are associated with infectious agents that play a direct (EB virus, HTLV1) or indirect role (e.g. Helicobacter pylori in MALT lymphoma) in lymphomagenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is abnormally expressed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and its expression associated with chromosomal translocations involving the ALK gene at 2p23. These translocations lead to the synthesis of novel chimeric proteins that retain the C-terminal portion of ALK, where the tyrosine kinase domain is located. In most of these tumors, the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation causes fusion of the ALK gene to the 5' region of the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene, but other different ALK partners have been identified, including nonmuscle tropomyosin (TPM3), TRK-fused gene (TFG), 5' aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltranferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), clathrin heavy chain gene (CLTC), and moesin (MSN). The characterization of these ALK partners has been performed using different molecular methods, including the 5' Rapid Amplification of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) Ends (5'RACE) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. This approach allows the potential amplification and identification of either 5' or 3' mRNA ends from an internal known sequence. In ALK translocations, identification of the 5' gene involved has been performed using primers designed within the known 3' catalytic domain of the ALK. Initial reaction consists in a first-strand cDNA synthesis primed using a gene-specific antisense primer (ALK1), performing the cDNA conversion of specific messenger ribonucleic acids, and maximizing the potential for complete extension to the 5'-end of the message. After cDNA synthesis, the first-strand product is purified from unincorporated dNTPs and ALK1. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is used to add homopolymeric tails to the 3' ends of the cDNA. Tailed cDNA is then amplified by PCR using a nested gene-specific primer (ALK2), which anneals 3' to ALK1, and a complementary homopolymer containing an anchor primer (i.e., AAP), which permits amplification from the homopolymeric tail. This allows amplification of unknown sequences between the ALK2 and the 5' end of the mRNA. Further, nested PCRs usually are required to confer an adequate level of specificity to the process to permit the characterization of RACE products. The reamplification is achieved by using a nested gene-specific primer (ALK3), which anneals 3' to ALK2, and a universal amplification primer, which anneals to the 5' sequence previously introduced by the AAP primer.",

The standard therapy for PTCLs is CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or a comparable CHOP-like regimen that incorporates anthracyclines. With the exception of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+) ALCL), the cure rate for PTCLs with CHOP is low, and limited evidence suggests that anthracyclines do not improve the prognosis. However, there is no compelling evidence that any other regimen or approach is superior. It remains challenging to compare alternative therapies or treatment strategies with CHOP because the majority of data are retrospective and include diverse patient populations. Recently, prospective studies have been initiated exclusively for PTCL, and in some, select histologic subtypes are evaluated in an effort to remove heterogeneity. Encouragingly, there have been several new therapies emerging with activity in PTCLs and exciting novel combinations under consideration that will hopefully move the field forward and improve outcome in this challenging group of diseases.",

The NOVA1 expression level varied according to the subtype; it was higher in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-LBL), but it was lower in ALK-positive ALCL. In almost all B-cell lymphomas, NOVA1 expression was very low or negative.

Sixty-one cases of inflammatory pseudotumors were retrieved from the surgical pathology archives and consultation files. Paraffin sections were immunostained with the antibody ALK1. The patients ranged in age from 0.5 to 79 years (median age, 50 years), with 10 patients (16.4%) younger than 20 years. Five cases (8.2%) were ALK+, including two of six urogenital inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, none of eight pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumors, three (one adrenal, one small bowel, one liver) of 31 extrapulmonary inflammatory pseudotumors, none of nine hepatic/splenic inflammatory pseudotumors expressing follicular dendritic cell markers and harboring Epstein-Barr virus, and none of seven inflammatory pseudotumors of the lymph node. When only those patients 40 years or younger were considered, the ALK positivity rate became 21.7% (five of 23). All five ALK+ cases occurred in young patients aged 0.5 to 37 years, who were alive and well at 3.5 to 17 years. The tumors exhibited a spectrum of histologic features typical of inflammatory pseudotumors/myofibroblastic tumors, but there was at least focal nuclear atypia. Immunostaining for ALK produced fibrillary or granular cytoplasmic staining in the neoplastic cells, sometimes with cell membrane accentuation. This study confirms that ALK is implicated in a proportion of inflammatory pseudotumors, and is generally associated with a favorable outcome.

In contrast, all ALK-positive tumors showed diffuse reactivity for the Th2-associated receptor CCR4 (5 of 5 patients). CCR4 expression was also a consistent feature of the large-cell transformation of mycosis fungoides. CCR5 expression showed no consistent association with any T-cell tumor type.

The NPM-ALK chimeric gene is an activated tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be a potent oncogene. We have developed a cellular model for the study of p80 action in rat 1a fibroblasts. Expression of cDNA's encoding NPM-ALK (p80) in rat 1a fibroblasts induces anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and promotes foci formation in culture. Cells expressing exogenous p80 showed significantly increased proliferation characterized by accelerated cell cycle entry into S-phase. Consistent with increased G0/G1 to S-phase transition, there is also marked up-regulation of cyclin A and cyclin D1 expression. In addition, p80 transformed cells showed elevated expression of several immediate early genes involved in cellular proliferation, including fos, jun, and c-myc. DNA binding analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from p80 transformed cells reveal marked up-regulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity. Functional AP-1-specific transfection assays also show up-regulation of AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation. These finding demonstrate that p80 transformed rat 1a fibroblast can be a highly useful model system for the molecular and biochemical characterization of the mechanisms of action of this interesting new oncogene.",

Serious complications at presentation due to tumor lysis syndrome or local tumor effects are commonly observed. Thus, a rapid diagnosis with the least invasive procedure enabling the initiation of early and specific therapy is necessary to diminish early fatality or persistent impairment. In 56 centrally registered patients with NHL, cytomorphologic analyses (FAB criteria) of May-Grünwald-Giemsa-stained touch imprints or malignant effusions and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (EGIL criteria) of fresh cell suspensions with a standardized panel of monoclonal antibodies were performed. The authors identified 23 patients with Burkitt lymphoma by the combination of FAB L3 morphology and a mature B-cell phenotype and 22 patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma by FAB L1/L2 morphology and a T-/B-cell precursor phenotype. They also found 11 patients with large cell lymphomas, 3 of them with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (T-cell phenotype; NPM/ALK-positive). In the remaining 8 patients diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was suspected by the combined use of cytologic and immunophenotypic findings (mature B-cell phenotype). In all cases with available solid tumor material (n = 42/56) the preliminary diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and, in a few cases, some large cell lymphomas could be classified reliably by cytomorphology and immunophenotyping of freshly obtained tumor cell material, enabling an early start of specific lymphoma treatment.",

Lymphomas arising adjacent to breast implants are rare, and most cases reported to date have been anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Here we report a 41-year-old white woman with bilateral saline breast implants placed for cosmetic reasons who almost 9 years later developed painful swelling at the right-breast implant site. Excisional biopsy revealed lymphoma composed of monomorphic large cells associated with necrosis and angioinvasion. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an aberrant, NK/T-cell immunophenotype with the lymphoma cells being CD2+, CD3+, CD56+, partial CD30+, granzyme B, TIA-1+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7+, and CD8+. In situ hybridization analysis showed Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA within the neoplastic cells. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed monoclonal T-cell receptor-γ chain gene rearrangement. These findings support the diagnosis of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. On the basis of our review of the literature, this case is unique. In addition, we believe this case is important to report, because it expands the spectrum of T-cell lymphomas that can be associated with breast implants and may be a forerunner of additional cases to follow.",

The common phenotypic hallmark is the expression of CD30-antigen by the tumor cells which morphologically resemble Reed-Sternberg cells. Although LyP is a non-fatal recurring disorder, it is associated with systemic lymphomas including Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), mycosis fungoides (MF) and ALCL in 5-20% of the cases. Currently there is no marker to predict the development of systemic lymphomas in patients with LyP. Fascin, an actin bundling protein, has recently been shown to be a unique marker found in almost 100% of classical HL.;Because of the association of LyP with HL, fascin expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in LyP (n = 45), cutaneous CD30+ ALCL (n = 17) and pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma (n = 9) (PTL) and LyP associated with systemic lymphomas (7 HL, 2 ALCL, 1 MF), with the intent to determine if fascin expression can predict disease progression.;Fascin was expressed by tumor cells in 11/45 (24%) cases of LyP, 11/17 (64%) cases of ALCL, 7/9 (77%) cases of PTL and 6/10 (60%) cases of LyP associated with systemic lymphomas. Fascin expression in LyP was significantly less frequent than in ALCL (p < 0.001) and also than in LyP associated with lymphomas (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference of fascin expression within the histological subtypes of LyP. We found no evidence of ALK expression nor of Epstein-Barr virus expression in any case either by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry in the LyP cases associated with HL.;This is the first study to demonstrate that fascin is expressed in cutaneous CD30+ LPD and that it is a candidate marker of disease progression in LyP.",

AGL is associated with high risk for lymphoma, especially PTCL. Autoimmunity likely contributes to this risk. Lymphoma developed with or without metreleptin, suggesting metreleptin does not directly cause lymphoma development; a theoretical role of metreleptin in lymphoma progression remains possible.

Differential diagnosis with other tumor processes is sometimes difficult. Similar anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene abnormalities as in anaplastic large cell lymphoma have been reported.

This article aims to evaluate ALK, EBV, and HHV-8 expression in children with IMT and to correlate our findings with clinical features.;Sixteen children (range, 1-15 years) who had surgery for IMT between 1978 and 2003 were evaluated retrospectively. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues were stained for HHV-8 and ALK with immunohistochemistry. Epstein-Barr virus was detected by in situ hybridization (EBER probes).;Tumors were located in the pulmonary lobe (n = 4), urinary tract (n = 4), mesentery or bowel (n = 4), hepatic lobe (n = 1), vena cava (n = 1), spinal cord (n = 1), and soft tissue (n = 1). Five children were treated with steroids and/or antibiotics before surgery, with no substantial result. IMT was excised totally in all but 2 cases. Four patients presented aggressive IMT with recurrence or metastasis requiring new surgery. ALK was positive in 3 (18.8%) cases and EBV in 1 pulmonary and 1 bladder tumor, all of them without recurrence or metastasis. None of the cases were positive for HHV-8. All patients are now disease-free with a mean follow-up of 4.2 years.;Considering the present lack of efficient medical treatment, surgery should still be considered as the mainstay therapy in IMT, even in cases of recurrence or metastases.

Many findings have revealed a complex scenario of NPM functions and interactions, pointing to proliferative and growth-suppressive roles of this molecule. The gene NPM1 that encodes for nucleophosmin (NPM1) is translocated or mutated in various lymphomas and leukemias, forming fusion proteins (NPM-ALK, NPM-RARalpha, NPM-MLF1) or NPM mutant products. Here, we review the structure and functions of NPM, as well as the biological, clinical and pathological features of human hematologic malignancies with NPM1 gene alterations. NPM-ALK indentifies a new category of T/Null lymphomas with distinctive molecular and clinico-pathological features, that is going to be included as a novel disease entity (ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma) in the new WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms. NPM1 mutations occur specifically in about 30% of adult de novo AML and cause aberrant cytoplasmic expression of NPM (hence the term NPMc+ AML). NPMc+ AML associates with normal karyotpe, and shows wide morphological spectrum, multilineage involvement, a unique gene expression signature, a high frequency of FLT3-internal tandem duplications, and distinctive clinical and prognostic features. The availability of specific antibodies and molecular techniques for the detection of NPM1 gene alterations has an enormous impact in the biological study diagnosis, prognostic stratification, and monitoring of minimal residual disease of various lymphomas and leukemias. The discovery of NPM1 gene alterations also represents the rationale basis for development of molecular targeted drugs.",

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissues from 10 IMTs and 125 other soft tissue tumors were stained for ALK1 and p80 with standard immunohistochemistry. ALK1 and/or p80 reactivity was observed in a cytoplasmic pattern in IMT (4/10; 40%), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (4/10; 40%), rhabdomyosarcoma (6/31; 19%), leiomyosarcoma (1/10; 10%), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1/11; 9%). No staining was observed in nodular fasciitis, desmoid, infantile myofibromatosis, infantile fibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyoma, or myofibrosarcoma. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (4/16; 25%) displayed a distinctive dot-like cytoplasmic positivity. No cases displayed nuclear reactivity. Fluorescent in situ hybridization on 12 of the positive cases revealed a combination of abnormalities including ALK break-apart signals, nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK fusions, or extra copies of 2p23. This study demonstrates that in addition to IMT, abnormalities of ALK1 and p80 expression with a variety of structural chromosomal changes are found in several sarcomas, especially rhabdomyosarcoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Although immunoreactivity in non-IMTs cannot distinguish between structural abnormalities involving 2p23 or additional copies of 2p23, it supports the concept of ALK involvement in a larger group of neoplasms, some of which have other documented clonal abnormalities. In IMT, immunohistochemistry for ALK1 and p80 is useful as an indicator of a 2p23 abnormality, but it must be interpreted in the context of histologic and other clinicopathologic data if used as an adjunct to differential diagnosis.",

The most common PTCLs, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-negative), despite their unique presentations and histologies, are currently treated similarly. Here we discuss our general approach to the treatment of the most common PTCLs. Based on the best data currently available, which include retrospective analyses and phase 2 prospective studies, our approach has involved cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone-based therapy followed by consolidation in first remission with autologous stem cell transplant. This treatment strategy likely improves the outcome for patients compared with historical series; however, progression-free survival rates remain disappointing, ranging from 40% to 50%. This is currently an exciting time in the treatment of PTCL due to the advent of recently approved drugs as well as new targeted agents currently under investigation. In addition, gene expression profiling is allowing for a better understanding of underlying disease biology, improved diagnostic accuracy, and prognostication in PTCL. As a result, over the next few years, we expect a significant shift in our management of these diseases with a move toward more individualized therapy leading to improved outcomes.",

Newer-generation inhibitors may help overcome resistance mutations, and inhibitor combinations can target parallel pathways, but durable benefit to patients remains elusive in most clinical scenarios. Now, recent studies suggest a third approach may be available in some cases-exploitation of oncogene overexpression that may arise to promote resistance. Here, we discuss the importance of maintaining oncogenic signaling at \"just-right\" levels in cells, with too much signaling, or oncogene overdose, being potentially as detrimental as too little. This is highlighted in particular by recent studies of mutant-BRAF in melanoma and the fusion kinase nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Oncogene overdose may be exploitable to prolong tumor control through intermittent dosing in some cases, and studies of acute lymphoid leukemias suggest that it may be specifically pharmacologically inducible.

Notably, ALK was initially discovered as the fusion gene in anaplastic large cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a disease predominantly of childhood. The discovery of activating kinase domain mutations of the full-length ALK receptor as the major cause of hereditary neuroblastoma, and that somatically acquired mutations and amplification events often drive the malignant process in a subset of sporadic tumors, has established ALK as a tractable molecular target across histologically diverse tumors in which ALK is a critical mediator of oncogenesis. We are now uncovering the reexpression of this developmentally regulated protein in a broader subset of pediatric cancers, providing therapeutic targeting opportunities for diseases with shared molecular etiology.

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has emerged as an important oncogene in a number of human malignancies ranging from non-Hodgkin lymphoma to neuroblastoma. In the former case, ALK is activated as a consequence of a chromosomal translocation and in the latter due to point mutations. In both cases the transforming potential of these oncogenic forms of ALK have been shown in vitro employing traditional cellular transformation assays including 3T3 foci formation. We reasoned that other ALK mutants which have been identified by the Cancer Genome Project may likewise possess transformation potential. We have selected seven ALK mutants identified in cell lines representative of a variety of human cancers based on position within the ALK protein, zygosity and frequency of detection including R1192Q, K1525E, C1021Y, R412C, A1252V, D1311A, K1518N and have compared their transformation capability in comparison to the published neuroblastoma-associated F1174L ALK mutant when expressed in immortalized p53(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts. Whilst the F1174L mutant reproducibly drives foci formation in vitro, the other ALK mutants fail in this task. Furthermore, apart from the F1174L ALK mutant, the ALK protein is not phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 1604 suggesting that they are kinase-inactive in this cellular context. We conclude that not all ALK mutants have transformation potential and may represent \"passenger\" mutations in the evolution of cancer.",

A dose escalation of lenalidomide (days 1-21, q28) was planned using a 3 + 3 design. As two patients treated with 10 mg/day experienced dose-limiting toxicity (thrombocytopenia grade 3, stroke grade 4), the primary end point of our trial was reached; the maximal tolerable dose of lenalidomide was 5 mg/day (level -I). Adverse events grade ≥3 were observed as thrombocytopenia (23 %), leukocytopenia (15 %), anemia (8 %), and neutropenia (8 %).

In the adult hematopoietic system, HH signaling regulates intrathymic T-cell development, and it is one of the survival signals provided by follicular dendritic cells to prevent apoptosis in germinal center B cells. HH signaling is required for primitive hematopoiesis; however, conflicting data have been reported regarding the role of the HH pathway in adult hematopoiesis. Inappropriate activation of the HH signaling pathway occurs in several human cancers, including hematological neoplasms. Emerging data demonstrate abnormal HH pathway activation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and acute leukemias. In these neoplasms, HH signaling promotes proliferation and survival, contributes to the maintenance of cancer stem cells, and enhances tolerance or resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we review current understanding of HH signaling, its role in the pathobiology of hematological malignancies, and its potential as a therapeutic target to treat malignant hematological neoplasms.",

The NPM1 gene on 5q35 is translocated with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene in anaplastic large cell lymphoma with t(2;5).

In each fused protein, the N-terminal NPM portion is associated with oligomerization of a partner protein leading to altered signal transduction or transcription. Recently, mutations of exon 12 have been found in a significant proportion of de novo AML, especially in those with a normal karyotype. Mutant NPM is localized aberrantly in the cytoplasm, but the molecular mechanisms for leukemia remain to be studied.

Consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been reported to improve progression-free survival. However, these studies have not compared consolidative ASCT with active observation in patients with PTCL achieving first complete remission (CR1) following induction chemotherapy. We conducted a retrospective analysis of PTCL patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2014. Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, concurrent B cell lymphomas, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-positive ALCL) were excluded from the study. We compared progression-free survival for patients who underwent ASCT in CR1 following CHOP-like induction regimens and patients who underwent active observation during CR1. 48 patients met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and underwent either active observation (28 patients) or consolidative ASCT (20 patients) in CR1. The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the observation and ASCT groups was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30-67%) and 46% (95% CI: 23-67%), respectively (P = 0.55).

Estimated 3-year progression-free survival in the observation and ASCT groups was 37 and 41%, respectively. In conclusion, for PTCL patients achieving CR1 following CHOP-like induction chemotherapy, ASCT does not appear to improve progression-free survival compared to active observation.

They have drawn much attention after the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RTK gene alterations include point mutations and gene fusions that result from chromosomal rearrangements. In both cases, they activate the kinase domain in the absence of ligand, producing a permanent signal for cell proliferation. Recently, this simple model has been refined. First, by contrast to wild-type RTK, many mutated RTK do not seem to signal from the plasma membrane, but from various locations inside the cell. Second, their signal transduction properties are altered: the pathways that are crucial for cell transformation, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors, do not necessarily contribute to the physiologic functions of these receptors. Finally, different mechanisms prevent the termination of the signal, which normally occurs through receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Several mutations inactivating CBL, a key RTK E3 ubiquitin ligase, have been recently described. In this review, we discuss the possible links among RTK trafficking, signaling, and degradation in leukemic cells.",

We evaluated TMOD1 expression in OSCC-derived cell lines and primary OSCC samples (n=200) using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting and semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. We also analyzed the clinical correlation between TMOD1 expression status and clinical parameters in patients with OSCC and performed a prospective study using 40 primary OSCC samples. TMOD1 expression was upregulated significantly (p<0.05) in OSCC in vitro and in vivo compared with normal counterparts. TMOD1 expression also was correlated significantly (p=0.0199 and p=0.0064, respectively) with regional lymph node metastasis (RLNM) and 5-year survival rates. This prospective study also showed that high TMOD1 expression was seen in 12 (75%) of 16 cases in RLNM-positive patients and 9 (37.5%) of 24 cases in RLNM-negative patients. The current data provide the first evidence that TMOD1 expression is a critical biomarker for RLNM and prognosis of patients with OSCC.",

Fifty-three patients were enrolled. Treatment was planned for up to 8 cycles but only 9% of patients received more than 6 cycles due primarily to disease progression (n = 13) or prolonged thrombocytopenia (n = 12). The overall response rate was 66% with a complete response rate of 57%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7·5 months. With a median follow-up of 7·6 years, 5-year PFS and overall survival (OS) were 21% and 48%, respectively. The patients with extranodal Natural Killer-cell lymphoma had a shorter PFS (median, 2·4 months) than other subtypes. Grade 3/4 anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 66%, 74% and 79% of patients, respectively. Of note, 23% of patients discontinued therapy due to prolonged thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, HCVIDD/MA for the first-line treatment of PTCL patients is associated with significant myelosuppression leading to poor treatment adherence, and the response and survival outcomes with this regimen are similar to standard CHOP.

The cytogenetic results were reviewed in correlation with the final pathologic diagnosis. A diagnosis of lymphoma was established in 94 cases, with 16 Hodgkin lymphomas and 78 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Cytogenetic results were obtained in 63 NHLs (81%); 61 of those showed abnormal karyotypes (97%). The t(14;18) or IGH-BCL2 fusion was detected in 83% (20/24) of follicular lymphomas and in 57% (12/21) of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). The application of interphase FISH and SKY has contributed to a high detection rate of t(14;18) in DLBCLs. This study showed that genes at 1q25, 3p21, 3q21, 5q31, 6p23, 7q22, 8q11 approximately q12, 9q34, 11q23, 12q13, and 19q13.1 may have been involved as the less common changes in follicular lymphoma and DLBCL. Comparison of the recurrent secondary aberrations in the groups of follicular lymphoma and DLBCL revealed a pattern of clonal evolution from the changes rea(1)(p36), del(6q), +7, +12 or dup or trp(12)(q13q22), +der(18)t(14;18), and +21 in follicular lymphoma to the changes rea(1)(p36), del(6q), +6, +7, +9, rea(11)(q23), +12, -13 or del(13(q12q14), +18, +21, and +X in DLBCL. The clonal evolution of the secondary aberrations is thought to contribute to the progression of the disease. About 90% (16/18) of other types of NHL had abnormal karyotypes showing specific translocations or gene rearrangements consistent with the pathologic diagnosis. A comprehensive cytogenetics approach including SKY and interphase FISH using probes for specific genes, such as IGH, BCL2, CCND1, and ALK, is a very useful ancillary diagnostic tool for lymphomas. The combined approach also led to the identification of t(2;19)(p23;q13.1) as a new variant of t(2;5)(p23;q35) in a case of Ki-1-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma with a null cell phenotype.",

Biopsy of the right axillary node revealed morphology of malignant lymphoma in which large cells with abundant cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei were scattered among small lymphocytes. Immunostaining with various monoclonal antibodies revealed the large cells to be CD79+, CD20/L26+, CD45RO/UCHL-(1-), CD3-, CD10-, CD30+, NPM/ALK-, EMA-, CD15-, and bcl-(2-). Amplification of the J region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain by polymerase chain reaction revealed a single rearranged band. Therefore the diagnosis of anaplastic large cell variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, stage IIIB, was made from the standpoint of the new WHO classification of malignant lymphoma. Biopsy led to findings of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoma with positive in situ hybridization results for EBV small RNAs, positive results of immunostaining with EBV latent membrane 1 antibody, and negative results of immunostaining with Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2.

Compared to B-cell lymphomas, PTCL more frequently involve extranodal sites and have a worse prognosis. Because of their usually indolent course, primary cutaneous T/NK-cell lymphomas should be distinguished from the other PTCL. Staging of PTCL is done according to the Ann Arbor staging system. The International Prognostic Index, established for aggressive B-cell lymphomas, has also proved relevant for PTCL. Standard therapy for PTCL has not been defined, yet. First line anthracycline-based chemotherapy brings about long-term remissions in 15 to 42% of patients. Apart from (ALK-positive) anaplastic large cell lymphoma it thus gives poorer results than those obtained in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Data for high-dosage therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) for relapsing and refractory PTCL are similar to those reported for aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Thus this treatment seems to constitute a sensible salvage strategy. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation following reduced conditioning regimens has also given promising results in patients with relapse. However, the impact of high-dosage strategies and the implementation of newer agents, such as alemtuzumab, in first-line treatment are still uncertain. Hence patients with PTCL should be treated within clinical trials.",

Efforts have been made to combine novel techniques with cytology and immunochemistry in order to more precisely define these entities. Molecular profiling has contributed to novel insights in the biology of T-cell lymphoma. Regarding anaplastic large cell lymphoma, low expression T-cell receptor signalling and high STAT3 target signatures have been associated with the ALK-positive subgroup. Gene expression profiling differentiates angioblastic T-cell lymphoma from other T-cell malignancies, suggests that the normal counterpart of lymphoma cells are follicular helper T cells, and supports the involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor deregulation in its physiopathology. In peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified, gene profiling suggests the normal counterpart of tumour cells are activated CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, delineates prognostic groups depending on the proliferative signature, and suggests therapeutic options aimed at regulating nuclear factor-kappaB and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha phosphorylation. Gene expression profiling of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas highlighted the importance of abnormal methylation patterns, suggested a pivotal role for JUNB/AP-1, and defined a predictive model for response to interferon-alpha.

The present report describes a detailed immunocytochemical study of the distribution and localization of human LSP1 in both normal and neoplastic cells and tissues. The specificity of the monoclonal anti-LSP1 reagent was confirmed by expression cloning and transfection studies. The intracellular 60 000 MW LSP1 protein was found to be present in peripheral blood B cells, monocytes and granulocytes but absent in a subpopulation of circulating T cells (10-15% of CD3-positive T cells). The presence of LSP1 protein in medullary thymocytes, but only in scattered cortical thymocytes, provided additional evidence for heterogeneity of expression in T cells. Novel observations also included the presence of LSP1 in plasma cells, dendritic cells and Langerhans' cells. The leucocyte-restricted distribution of LSP1 protein means that it may play an important role in haematopathology. LSP1 protein was detected in a wide range of leukaemias and lymphomas, particularly of B-cell origin, and in tumour cells in classical Hodgkin's disease. Of interest was the indication of a reciprocal relationship in the expression of LSP1 and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) proteins in patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

This is particularly applicable to the diagnosis of angiommunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unclassified (PTCLU), because of their histologic and immunophenotypic overlap with reactive lymphoid proliferations. Recently, immunohistochemistry for programmed death-1 (PD-1), a marker of follicular helper T cells, was shown to be sensitive in the detection of AITL and PTCLU. The sensitivity of this marker in reactive entities, however, has not been adequately evaluated. We confirm that PD-1 staining is a highly sensitive marker in the diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphomas: increased extrafollicular PD-1-positive cells were seen in 93% (76/82) of AITL, 62% (16/26) of PTCLU, and 11% (2/18) of anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphomas. The majority of reactive lymphadenopathies including Cat-scratch disease, Kikuchi lymphadenitis, Castleman disease, and reactive follicular hyperplasia showed no PD-1 staining outside follicles. Some reactive lymph nodes, showed increased extrafollicular PD-1-positive cells in a pattern similar to AITL and PTCLU, and include progressive transformation of germinal centers, viral lymphadenitis (Epstein-Barr virusand human immunodeficiency virus) and Rosai-Dorfman disease. This study shows that PD-1-positive cells may be increased in a number of settings other than T-cell lymphomas. We conclude that staining for PD-1 in reactive and atypical lymphadenopathies should be interpreted with caution and in the context of other ancillary immunophenotypic and molecular studies before a diagnosis of AITL or PTCLU is entertained.",

The reasons include their chemotherapeutic resistant nature and the absence of effective antibody agents for T-cell lymphomas. The number of T-cell lymphoma subtypes increased from 21 in the WHO classification 2008 to 29 in the WHO classification 2016. This means that T-cell lymphomas are heterogeneous. T-cell lymphomas can be divided to ALK-positive anaplastic lymphoma (ALCL) with a good prognosis and others with poorer prognoses. ALK-positive ALCL can be successfully treated with CHOP, but the others cannot. P-glycoprotein resistant anthracyclines, etoposide, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are increasingly applied to improve outcomes, but no standard treatment approach has yet been established. Regarding relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma, many novel agents are currently under development. The treatment outcomes of T-cell lymphoma need to be improved by applying innovative strategies including further novel agents.",

And, among 10 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), there were diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n = 6),B-cell lymphoma, non-classifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma (n = 1), small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 1), anaplastic large cell lymphoma with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive (n = 1) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 1). The median age was 26(22-35) years.Superficial lymphadenopathy was more common in HL than in NHL (10/11 vs 3/10, P = 0.008). At diagnosis, bulky disease and extranodal involvement were more prevalent in NHL than in HL (8/10 vs 2/11, P = 0.009; 7/10 vs 2/11, P = 0.030). All patients received chemotherapy and those with early stages also had combined radiotherapy. Ten patients with HL and 6 patients with NHL achieved complete remission. During a median follow-up of 90 months for HL, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 87.5% and 100% respectively. And during a median follow-up of 31 months for NHL, the 2-year PFS and OS rates were 66.7% and 77.8% respectively. The values of PFS and OS of NHL were inferior to those of HL (P = 0.073 and P = 0.066 respectively).One case of HL and 1 case of NHL received chemotherapy in the second trimester. The patients and their children experienced good outcomes.;NSCHL is the most prevalent subtype of HL during pregnancy. B cell lymphoma and aggressive subtypes are most common for NHL during pregnancy. The outcomes of NHL are inferior to those of HL during pregnancy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In the literature, sufficient attention has not been paid to the precise subcellular localization of immunohistochemical signals, the knowledge of which is essential for proper interpretation of immunostains and distinction of genuine staining from biotin-associated or other nonspecific stainings. The subcellular localization of the signals can in fact be easily deduced from the known biologic or ultrastructural characteristics of the antigens. Extracellular antigens obviously are located in the extracellular compartment. Cellular antigens fall into 3 major groups: membranous, nuclear, and cytoplasmic. Membranous antigens include cell adhesion molecules (such as E-cadherin, N-CAM), cell surface/transmembrane receptors and proteins (such as tyrosine kinase receptors, most leukocyte antigens, CD10, CEA), and molecules linking surface molecules to cytoskeleton (such as beta-catenin, dystrophin). Nuclear antigens include cell cycle-associated proteins (such as cyclins, p16, Ki-67), nuclear enzymes (such as TdT), transcription factors (such as TTF-1, CDX-2, myogenin, PAX-5), tumor suppressor gene products (such as p53, p63, WT1, Rb), steroid hormone receptors (such as ER, PR), calcium-binding proteins (such as S-100 protein, calretinin), and some viral proteins (such as CMV, herpes). Cytoplasmic antigens can take up a granular pattern due to localization in organelles, granules, or secretory vesicles (such as chromogranin, hormones, lysozyme, HMB-45), fibrillary pattern attributable to the filamentous nature of the molecules (intermediate filaments and microfilaments), or diffuse or patchy pattern due to localization in the cytosol or large vesicles (such as myoglobin, albumin, thyroglobulin). Aberrant localization of the molecules, when present, can provide important insight into disease processes and aid in their diagnosis, such as loss of membranous E-cadherin expression in lobular breast carcinoma, aberrant nuclear localization of beta-catenin in colorectal adenocarcinoma, pattern of ALK staining in anaplastic large cell lymphoma correlating with the different types of chromosomal translocations, presence of additional cytoplasmic CD10 staining in the enterocytes indicative of microvillous inclusion disease, and \"reversed\" staining for EMA in micropapillary mammary carcinoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ALCL is widely recognized with its broad morphologic and phenotypic spectrum causing controversy in the diagnosis of this peculiar neoplasm. It is now beyond doubt that a significant proportion(64 to 84%) of the cases diagnosed as ALCL is closely associated with the expression of chimeric NPM-ALK protein activated by the (2;5) (p23;q35) chromosomal translocation, which can be detected by anti-p80NPM/ALK or ALK1 antibodies. Recently, some investigators including us asserted that these p80NPM/ALK or ALK1-positive(p80/ALK+) ALCLs represent a distinct genetic entity with occurrence in young patients and a favorable prognosis, and should be differentiated from the p80/ALK- tumors with the relatively aggressive clinical course. The p80/ALK+ lymphomas also revealed the characteristic morphology such as horseshoe-like, kidney-like or doughnut-like nuclei and frequent expression of EMA and cytotoxic molecules. However, these features are shared, though to a lesser degree, by other p80/ALK-negative lymphoid neoplasms. Indeed, it is indicated that cytotoxic ALCL cases may be either p80/ALK positive or negative, suggesting that the cytotoxicity and expression of p80/ALK are independent phenomena among the cases of ALCL of T- and null-cell type. Thus, several areas of disagreement and controversy that surround the diagnosis and categorization of ALCL remain.",

The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum. Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group. This fact has been taken into account by the new WHO classification of malignant lymphomas. There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes. The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immuno-phenotypical and genetic findings. In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities.

        "Doc_abstract":"T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that represent 10%-15% of all NHLs. The prognosis of relapsed T-cell NHL is poor, especially for those relapsing after an autologous (auto-) or allogeneic (allo-) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Disease relapse post auto-HCT is best managed on a clinical trial. In the absence of an investigational protocol, the choice of salvage therapies should take into account patient performance status, eligibility for an allo-HCT, and surface CD30 expression. CD30-directed therapies or aggressive salvage regimens can be used as a bridge to allo-HCT in medically fit patients. In the elderly or more infirm patients, single-agent therapies could be offered, aiming at palliation. Similarly, relapse after an allo-HCT is not uncommon and is a real challenge. Reduction in ongoing immune suppression or donor lymphocyte infusion are often considered in this setting to augment graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effects and can occasionally provide durable disease control. Clinical trials designed to investigate novel therapeutic agents with immunomodulatory properties to augment GVL effects (eg, histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitors, proteasome inhibitor, lenalidomide) or targeted therapies (eg, aurora A kinase inhibitors, anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] inhibitors) are sorely needed to improve the dismal outcomes of T-cell NHL relapsing after an allo-HCT.",

No such \"signalosome\" is found in rafts of ALK(+) T lymphoma and Hodgkin-derived cell lines, despite similar Cbp/PAG, Lyn, and STAT3 expression and similar amounts of raft sphingolipids. Stable association of the signalosome with B-NHL rafts requires (1) a Lyn kinase (auto)phosphorylated in its regulatory and active site tyrosines, (2) a Cbp/PAG adaptor phosphorylated at tyrosine 317 and bound to Lyn SH2 via phosphotyrosine 299 and neighboring residues, and (3) a tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 linked via SH2 to the regulatory, C-terminal tyrosine of Lyn. No Csk appears to be part of this B-NHL signalosome. An oncogenic role for Lyn was shown after exposure of B-NHL lines to Lyn inhibitors that prevented Lyn and Cbp/PAG phosphorylation, dissociated the signalosome from rafts, and eventually induced death. Cell death followed decreases in Lyn or Cbp/PAG expression levels in one mantle cell lymphoma line, but not in a Hodgkin-derived one.
