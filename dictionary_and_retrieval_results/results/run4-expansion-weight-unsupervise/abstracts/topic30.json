RET and ROS1 fusion-positive tumors are mainly observed in young, female, and/or never smoking patients. Studies based on in vitro and in vivo (i.e., mouse) models and studies of several fusion-positive patients indicate that inhibiting the kinase activity of the RET and ROS1 fusion proteins is a promising therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, there are several ongoing clinical trials aimed at examining the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against RET and ROS1 proteins in patients with fusion-positive lung cancer. Other gene fusions (NTRK1, NRG1, and FGFR1/2/3) that are targetable by existing TKIs have also been identified in NSCLCs. Options for personalized lung cancer therapy will be increased with the help of multiplex diagnosis systems able to detect multiple druggable gene fusions. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The recent discovery and characterization of an oncogenic ROS1 gene fusion in a subset of lung cancers has raised significant clinical interest because small molecule inhibitors may be effective to these tumors. As lung cancers with ROS1 rearrangements comprise only 1-3% of lung adenocarcinomas, patients with such tumors must be identified to gain optimal benefit from molecular therapy. Recently, immunohistochemical analyses using a novel anti-ROS1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (D4D6) have shown promise for accurate identification of ROS1-rearranged cancers. To validate this finding, we compared the immunostaining results of tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 17 ROS1-rearranged and 253 ROS1-non-rearranged lung carcinomas. All 17 ROS1-rearranged cancers showed ROS1 immunoreactivity mostly in a diffuse and moderate-to-strong manner with an H-score range of 5-300 (median, 260). In contrast, 69% of ROS1-non-rearranged cancers lacked detectable immunoreactivity, whereas the remaining 31% showed reactivity mainly in a weak or focal manner. The H-score for the entire ROS1-non-rearranged group ranged from 0 to 240 (median, 0). The difference in H-score between the two cohorts was statistically significant, and the H-score cutoff (≥150) allowed optimal discrimination (94% sensitivity and 98% specificity). Similar but slightly less-specific performance was achieved using the extent of diffuse (≥75%) staining or ≥2+ staining intensity as cutoffs. CD74-ROS1 and EZR-ROS1 fusions were significantly associated with at least focal globular immunoreactivity and plasma membranous accentuation, respectively, and these patterns were specific to ROS1-rearranged cases. Although full-length ROS1 is expressed in some ROS1-non-rearranged cases, we showed that establishment of an optimal set of interpretative criteria makes ROS1 immunohistochemistry a valuable method to rapidly and accurately screen lung cancer patients for appropriate molecular therapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"The targeting of oncogenic 'driver' kinases with small molecule inhibitors has proven to be a highly effective therapeutic strategy in selected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, acquired resistance to targeted therapies invariably arises and is a major limitation to patient care. ROS1 fusion proteins are a recently described class of oncogenic driver, and NSCLC patients that express these fusions generally respond well to ROS1-targeted therapy. In this study, we sought to determine mechanisms of acquired resistance to ROS1 inhibition. To accomplish this, we analyzed tumor samples from a patient who initially responded to the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib but eventually developed acquired resistance. In addition, we generated a ROS1 inhibition-resistant derivative of the initially sensitive NSCLC cell line HCC78. Previously described mechanisms of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors including target kinase-domain mutation, target copy number gain, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and conversion to small cell lung cancer histology were found to not underlie resistance in the patient sample or resistant cell line. However, we did observe a switch in the control of growth and survival signaling pathways from ROS1 to EGFR in the resistant cell line. As a result of this switch, ROS1 inhibition-resistant HCC78 cells became sensitive to EGFR inhibition, an effect that was enhanced by co-treatment with a ROS1 inhibitor. Our results suggest that co-inhibition of ROS1 and EGFR may be an effective strategy to combat resistance to targeted therapy in some ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC patients. ",

Our objective was to explore the frequency, clinicopathological characteristics and survival of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients.;ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements were screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in patients with completely resected non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. All positive samples were confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank for comparison.;A total of 385 patients underwent complete resection, including squamous cell carcinoma (n = 245), adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 85) and large cell carcinoma (n = 55). Twelve of them were identified as harboring fusion genes, including ALK (n = 7), ROS1 (n = 3) and RET (n = 2) rearrangements. The fusion frequencies of adenosquamous, squamous cell and large cell carcinomas were 8.2%, 1.6% and 1.8% respectively. Their median age was 49.5 years and 3 of them had a smoking history. No survival difference existed between fusion gene positive and negative patients (36.7 vs.50.2 months, P = 0.21).;The frequencies of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements are low in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients. And their clinical characteristics are similar to those in lung adenocarcinoma. Fusions of the above three genes are not prognostic factor for non-adnocarcinoma NSCLC patients.",

One of these RTKs, c-ros oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1), has been identified as a driver mutation in NSCLC, because its inhibition by crizotinib, an anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)/met proto-oncogene hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET)/ROS1 inhibitor, led to significant tumor shrinkage in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. Currently, only human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy has been successful in significantly prolonging the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC). There is a need for the discovery of additional novel targets in GC.;Anti-ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to screen 495 GC samples and was followed by simultaneous ROS1 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses in IHC-positive samples. Fusion partners in ROS1-rearranged GC were determined by RT-PCR. In all 495 samples, HER2 amplification was identified with FISH, and MET expression was identified by IHC.;Twenty-three tumor samples were ROS1 IHC-positive. Three of 23 patients were ROS1 FISH positive, HER2 FISH negative, and negative for MET overexpression; and 2 of those 3 patients harbored a solute carrier family 34 (sodium phosphate), member 2 (SLC34A2)-ROS1 fusion transcripts. No fusion partner was identified in the third patient. Both patients who had SLC34A2-ROS1 transcripts had poorly differentiated histology with recurrence and death within 2 years of curative surgery. ROS1 IHC-positive status was not identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.;In this study, an SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement was identified in GC, and the results provide a rationale for investigating the clinical efficacy of ROS1 inhibitors in this unique molecular subset of GC.

Although high response rates and disease control have been observed in lung cancer patients bearing rearranged ROS1 tumors (ROS1+) treated with the kinase inhibitor crizotinib, many of these patients eventually relapse.To identify mechanisms of resistance to ROS1 inhibitors we generated resistant cells from HCC78 lung cancer cells bearing the SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement. We found that activation of the RAS pathway in the HCC78 cell model, due to either KRAS/NRAS mutations or to KRAS amplification, rendered the cells resistant to ROS1 inhibition. These cells were cross-resistant to different ROS1 inhibitors, but sensitive to inhibitors of the RAS signaling pathway. Interestingly, we identified focal KRAS amplification in a biopsy of a tumor from a patient that had become resistant to crizotinib treatment.Altogether our data suggest that the activation of members of the RAS family can confer resistance to ROS1 inhibitors. This has important clinical implications as: (i) RAS genetic alterations in ROS1+ primary tumors are likely negative predictors of efficacy for targeted drugs and (ii) this kind of resistance is unlikely to be overcome by the use of more specific or more potent ROS1 targeting drugs.

The phylogenetic proximity of the ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) catalytic domains led to the clinical repurposing of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK inhibitor crizotinib as a ROS1 inhibitor. Despite the antitumor activity of crizotinib observed in both ROS1- and ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, resistance due to acquisition of ROS1 or ALK kinase domain mutations has been observed clinically, spurring the development of second-generation inhibitors. Here, we profile the sensitivity and selectivity of seven ROS1 and/or ALK inhibitors at various levels of clinical development. In contrast to crizotinib's dual ROS1/ALK activity, cabozantinib (XL-184) and its structural analog foretinib (XL-880) demonstrate a striking selectivity for ROS1 over ALK. Molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal structural features that distinguish the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains and contribute to differences in binding site and kinase selectivity of the inhibitors tested. Cell-based resistance profiling studies demonstrate that the ROS1-selective inhibitors retain efficacy against the recently reported CD74-ROS1(G2032R) mutant whereas the dual ROS1/ALK inhibitors are ineffective. Taken together, inhibitor profiling and stringent characterization of the structure-function differences between the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains will facilitate future rational drug design for ROS1- and ALK-driven NSCLC and other malignancies.

The approval was based on a clinically meaningful, durable objective response rate (ORR) in a multicenter, single-arm clinical trial (ROS1 cohort of Trial PROFILE 1001) in patients with ROS1-positive mNSCLC. The trial enrolled 50 patients (age range: 25-77 years) whose tumors were prospectively determined to have a ROS1 gene rearrangement by break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (96%) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (4%) clinical trial assays. Crizotinib demonstrated an ORR of 66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51%-79%) with a median duration of response of 18.3 months by independent radiology review and 72% (95% CI: 58%-84%) by investigator review. Patients received crizotinib 250 mg twice daily and had a median duration of exposure of 34.4 months. The toxicity profile in ROS1-positive patients was generally consistent with the randomized safety data in the U.S. Product Insert from two ALK-positive mNSCLC trials. The most common (≥25%) adverse reactions and laboratory test abnormalities included vision disorders, elevation of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels, nausea, hypophosphatemia, diarrhea, edema, vomiting, constipation, neutropenia, and fatigue. There were no treatment-related deaths. A favorable benefit-to-risk evaluation led to the traditional approval of crizotinib for this new supplemental indication.;Given the results from the ROS1 cohort of the clinical trial PROFILE 1001, crizotinib represents a new treatment option and the first approved therapy for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors are ROS1 positive.

The present study shows that EZR-ROS1 plays an essential role in the oncogenesis of NSCLC harboring the fusion gene. EZR-ROS1 was identified in four female patients of lung adenocarcinoma. Three of them were never smokers. Interstitial deletion of 6q22-q25 resulted in gene fusion. Expression of the fusion kinase in NIH3T3 cells induced anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. This transforming ability was attributable to its kinase activity. The ALK/MET/ROS1 kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, suppressed fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells. Most importantly, established transgenic mouse lines specifically expressing EZR-ROS1 in lung alveolar epithelial cells developed multiple adenocarcinoma nodules in both lungs at an early age. These data suggest that the EZR-ROS1 is a pivotal oncogene in human NSCLC, and that this animal model could be valuable for exploring therapeutic agents against ROS1-rearranged lung cancer.",

Recently we have shown that the broad-range kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS) reactivates the apoptotic machinery in U1810 NSCLC cells [Joseph et al., Oncogene 21 (2002) 65]. Lately, several STS analogs that are more specific in kinase inhibition have been suggested for tumor treatment. In this study the apoptosis-inducing ability of the STS analogs PKC 412 and Ro 31-8220 used alone or in combination with DNA-damaging agents in U1810 cells was investigated. In these cells Ro 31-8220 neither induced apoptosis when used alone, nor sensitized cells to etoposide treatment. PKC 412 as a single agent induced death of a small number of U1810 cells, whereas it efficiently triggered a dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in U1285 small cell lung carcinoma cells. In both cell types PKC 412 triggered release of mitochondrial proteins followed by caspase activation. However, concomitant activation of a caspase-independent pathway was essential to kill NSCLC cells. Importantly, PKC 412 was able to sensitize etoposide- and radiation-induced death of U1810 cells. The best sensitization was achieved when PKC 412 was administered 24 h after treatments. In U1810 cells, Ro 31-8220 decreased PMA-induced ERK phosphorylation as efficiently as PKC 412, indicating that the failure of Ro 31-8220 to induce apoptosis was not due to weaker inhibition of conventional and novel PKC isoforms. However, Ro 31-8220 increased the basal level of ERK and Akt phosphorylation in both cell lines, whereas Akt phosphorylation was suppressed in the U1810 cells, which might influence apoptosis. These results suggest that PKC 412 could be a useful tool in increasing the efficiency of therapy of NSCLC.",

Firstly, it is confirmed that matrine induces apoptosis of human NSCLC cells with anti-apoptotic factors inhibited and dependent on caspase activity. In addition, we found that matrine increases the phosphorylation of p38 but not its total protein, and inhibition of the p38 pathway with SB202190 partially prevents matrine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, matrine generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which is reversed by pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Additionally, inhibition of cell proliferation and increase of phosphorylation of p38 was also partially reversed by NAC.

The cell death induced by PPARgamma activation presented apoptotic features of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in A549 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was accompanied by increased expression of proline oxidase (POX), a redox enzyme expressed in mitochondria, upon incubation with the agonists. POX RNA interference treatment blocked PPARgamma-induced ROS formation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that POX plays a functional role in apoptosis through ROS formation. The apoptotic effects by the agonists were antagonized by bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a PPARgamma antagonist, and by knockdown of PPARgamma expression, indicating the involvement of PPARgamma in these actions.

Recently, small studies of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) have suggested an incidence of EML4-ALK translocations of 0.4% to 2.4% and FIG-ROS1 translocations of 0.8%. In lung cancer, screening immunohistochemical staining for ALK and ROS1 has been validated as highly sensitive for these translocations, but this has not been investigated in CRC. We therefore sought to investigate the incidence of ALK and ROS1 overexpression as detected by immunohistochemical staining in a large cohort of CRCs. Of the 1889 CRCs, only 1 case (0.05%) demonstrated diffuse strong positive staining for ALK, whereas 14 (0.7%) showed weak nonspecific staining; the remainder were negative. The 1 positive case was confirmed to harbor an ALK rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), whereas the 14 tumors with weak staining were FISH-negative. The ALK positive case demonstrated positive expression in all dysplastic and malignant cells indicating that the translocation was an early clonal event. No cases were positive for ROS1 by immunohistochemical staining, although 2 cases did show some nonspecific staining and were shown to be negative for ROS1 translocation by FISH. We conclude that although diffuse strong positive staining for ALK is likely to be highly specific for ALK rearrangement in CRC, both ALK and ROS1 immunohistochemical staining are very low-yield tests and difficult to justify in the routine clinical setting.

More recently, low-frequency rearrangements of TRK kinases have been described in NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Spitzoid melanoma. Entrectinib, whose discovery and preclinical characterization are reported herein, is a novel, potent inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and, importantly, of TRK family kinases, which shows promise for therapy of tumors bearing oncogenic forms of these proteins. Proliferation profiling against over 200 human tumor cell lines revealed that entrectinib is exquisitely potent in vitro against lines that are dependent on the drug's pharmacologic targets. Oral administration of entrectinib to tumor-bearing mice induced regression in relevant human xenograft tumors, including the TRKA-dependent colorectal carcinoma KM12, ROS1-driven tumors, and several ALK-dependent models of different tissue origins, including a model of brain-localized lung cancer metastasis. Entrectinib is currently showing great promise in phase I/II clinical trials, including the first documented objective responses to a TRK inhibitor in colorectal carcinoma and in NSCLC. The drug is, thus, potentially suited to the therapy of several molecularly defined cancer settings, especially that of TRK-dependent tumors, for which no approved drugs are currently available.

The fusion oncogene, echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 - anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK), is present in approximately 5% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. Crizotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which silences the protein product of the ALK fusion gene and has recently been approved for the treatment of NSCLC aberrantly expressing ALK. Emerging data suggest that crizotinib may also have activity in other subsets of lung cancer, including tumors demonstrating amplification or mutation of the MET oncogene, or translocation of the ROS1 oncogene.;This paper gives an overview of the molecular pathogenesis of ALK-associated NSCLC. It also reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on crizotinib and outlines the preclinical and clinical studies leading to the approval of crizotinib. In addition, it discusses its role in the treatment of NSCLC expressing ALK.;Crizotinib represents the newest example of a focused strategy for drug development in lung cancer, based on identification and targeted inhibition of critical tumor-specific driver mutations.

To better understand the role of recently identified ROS1 and RET fusion oncokinases in pulmonary carcinogenesis, we examined 114 NSCLCs for SLC34A2-ROS1, EZR-ROS1, CD74-ROS1 and KIF5B-RET fusion transcripts using RT-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent sequencing analyses. Although the expression of SLC34A2-ROS1, EZR-ROS1, or KIF5B-RET fusion transcripts was not detected in any of the cases, the expression of CD74-ROS1 fusion transcripts was detected in one (0.9%) of the 114 NSCLCs. The fusion occurred between exon 6 of CD74 and exon 34 of ROS1 and was an in-frame alteration. The mutation was detected in a woman without a history of smoking. Histologically, the carcinoma was an adenocarcinoma with a predominant acinar pattern; notably, a mucinous cribriform pattern and a solid signet-ring cell pattern were also observed in part of the adenocarcinoma. ROS1 protein overexpression was immunohistochemically detected in a cancer-specific manner in both the primary cancer and the lymph node metastatic cancer. No somatic mutations were detected in the mutation cluster regions of the KRAS, EGFR, BRAF and PIK3CA genes and the entire coding region of p53 in the carcinoma, and the expression of ALK fusion was negative.

We found that some lung cancer cell lines and tumor samples are characterized by increased levels of lipidated LC3. Inhibition of autophagy sensitized non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis; however, such response was attenuated in cells treated with etoposide. Inhibition of autophagy stimulated ROS formation and treatment with cisplatin had a synergistic effect on ROS accumulation. Using genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide probes directed to intracellular compartments we found that autophagy inhibition facilitated formation of hydrogen peroxide in the cytosol and mitochondria of cisplatin-treated cells. The enhancement of cell death under conditions of inhibited autophagy was partially dependent on caspases, however, antioxidant NAC or hydroxyl radical scavengers, but not the scavengers of superoxide or a MnSOD mimetic, reduced the release of cytochrome c and abolished the sensitization of the cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Such inhibition of ROS prevented the processing and release of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) and HTRA2 from mitochondria. Furthermore, suppression of autophagy in NSCLC cells with active basal autophagy reduced their proliferation without significant effect on the cell-cycle distribution. Inhibition of cell proliferation delayed accumulation of cells in the S phase upon treatment with etoposide that could attenuate the execution stage of etoposide-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that autophagy suppression leads to inhibition of NSCLC cell proliferation and sensitizes them to cisplatin-induced caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis by stimulation of ROS formation.",

In recent decades only histomorphology was used to classify lung cancer as either small (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although NSCLC was further subdivided in different entities; however, as no specific therapy options were available classification of specific subtypes was not clinically meaningful. This fundamentally changed with the discovery of specific molecular alterations in adenocarcinoma (ADC), e.g. mutations in KRAS, EGFR and BRAF or translocations of the ALK and ROS1 gene loci, which now form the basis of targeted therapies and have led to a significantly improved patient outcome. The diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of imaging, morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics as well as their interaction were systematically assessed in a large cohort with available clinical data including patient survival. Specific and sensitive diagnostic markers and marker panels were defined and diagnostic test algorithms for predictive biomarker assessment were optimized. It was demonstrated that the semi-quantitative assessment of ADC growth patterns is a stage-independent predictor of survival and is reproducibly applicable in the routine setting. Specific histomorphological characteristics correlated with computed tomography (CT) imaging features and thus allowed an improved interdisciplinary classification, especially in the preoperative or palliative setting. Moreover, specific molecular characteristics, for example BRAF mutations and the proliferation index (Ki-67) were identified as clinically relevant prognosticators. Comprehensive clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular assessment of NSCLCs allow an optimized patient stratification. Respective algorithms now form the backbone of the 2015 lung cancer World Health Organization (WHO) classification. ",

Here, effects of BJO on the growth of NSCLC and SCLC cell lines were investigated by the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenytetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay, and the results showed that BJO inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells (NSCLC) and H446 cells (SCLC). Further studies revealed that BJO induced G0/G1 arrest partly via regulating p53 and cyclin D1 in these two cell lines. BJO also has pro-apoptotic effect on H446 and A549 cells through mitochondria/caspase-mediated pathway, which was initiated by the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). These findings thus revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of BJO on SCLC and NSCLC, which may benefit the further clinical application of BJO.",

Three EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib) received a European marketing authorization for up to first line treatment of EGFR mutated NSCLC. Effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors is higher than conventional chemotherapy. Third generation EGFR inhibitors (rociletinib, AZD9291) are effective for patients who develop a resistance mutation such as T790M resistance mutation; they obtained temporary authorization for use in France in 2015. The EML4-ALK translocation is found in about 5% of NSCLC and more particularly in adenocarcinoma of young non-smoking patients. Crizotinib is a new therapeutic standard in ALK translocated NSCLC in second line. Ceritinib is a 2nd generation ALK inhibitor which received a European marketing authorization for up to treatment of ALK translocated NSCLC after progression with crizotinib. INCA supports ACSé program evaluating the efficacy of crizotinib in NSCLC amplified for MET or translocated for ROS1 and ACSé program evaluating the efficacy of vemurafenib in tumors non melanoma mutated V600E BRAF.

In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity of NPS-1034, a newly developed drug that targets both MET and AXL, in NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib (HCC827/GR and HCC827/ER, respectively). Characterization of H820 cells and evaluation of NPS-1034 efficacy in these cells were also performed. The resistance of HCC827/GR was mediated by MET activation, whereas AXL activation led to resistance in HCC827/ER. The combination of gefitinib or erlotinib with NPS-1034 synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in both resistant cell lines. Accordingly, suppression of Akt was noted only in the presence of treatment with both drugs. NPS-1034 was also effective in xenograft mouse models of HCC827/GR. Although the H820 cell line was reported previously to have T790M and MET amplification, we discovered that AXL was also activated in this cell line. There were no antitumor effects of siRNA or inhibitors specific for EGFR or MET, whereas combined treatment with AXL siRNA or NPS-1034 and EGFR-TKIs controlled H820 cells, suggesting that AXL is the main signal responsible for resistance. In addition, NPS-1034 inhibited cell proliferation as well as ROS1 activity in HCC78 cells with ROS1 rearrangement.

We assessed 23 mutations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2) using pyrosequencing plus capillary electrophoresis. We also amplified EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the fusion genes ALK, ROS1, and RET using reverse transcription PCR.;Between July 2011 and January 2013, 60 SCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Samples included eight surgically resected snap-frozen samples, 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and seven pleural effusion samples. We detected 13 genomic aberrations in nine cases (15%), including an EGFR mutation (n=1, G719A), a KRAS mutation (n=1, G12D), PIK3CA mutations (n=3, E542K, E545K, E545Q), an AKT1 mutation (n=1, E17K), a MET amplification (n=1), and PIK3CA amplifications (n=6).

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancers are characterised by abundant genetic diversity with relatively few recurrent mutations occurring at high frequency. However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities. It is hoped that these discoveries may make a major contribution to improving outcome for patients with this poor prognosis disease. ",

ROS1 rearrangement was screened using fluorescence in situ hybridization.;Our study included 127 patients with lung adenocarcinoma without EGFR and KRAS mutations and ALK rearrangements. ROS1 rearrangement was detected in five (3.9%) of the 127 patients. Compared with ROS1-negative patients, the positive rate of ROS1 in female patients was significantly higher than in male patients (9.8% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.009). There were no differences in age, smoking status, stage or histological subtype between ROS1-positive and ROS1-negative patients. No significant difference in survival was detected between the ROS1-positive and ROS1-negative patients.;ROS1 rearrangement is a rare subset of lung adenocarcinoma. In 127 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, 3.9% of ROS1-positive patients with wild-type EGFR/KRAS/ALK were found.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer is now known as a disease of genomic alterations. Mutational analysis and genomics profiling in recent years have advanced the field of lung cancer genetics/genomics significantly. It is becoming more accepted now that the identification of genomic alterations in lung cancer can impact therapeutics, especially when the alterations represent \"oncogenic drivers\" in the processes of tumorigenesis and progression. In this review, we will highlight the key driver oncogenic gene mutations and fusions identified in lung cancer. The review will summarize and report the available demographic and clinicopathological data as well as molecular details behind various lung cancer gene alterations in the context of race. We hope to shed some light into the disparities in the incidence of various genetic mutations among lung cancer patients of different racial backgrounds. As molecularly targeted therapy continues to advance in lung cancer, racial differences in specific genetic/genomic alterations can have an important impact in the choices of therapeutics and in our understanding of the drug sensitivity/resistance profile. The most relevant genes in lung cancer described in this review include the following: EGFR, KRAS, MET, LKB1, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, RET, and ROS1. Commonly identified genetic/genomic alterations such as missense or nonsense mutations, small insertions or deletions, alternative splicing, and chromosomal fusion rearrangements were discussed. Relevance in current targeted therapeutic drugs was mentioned when appropriate. We also highlighted various targeted therapeutics that are currently under clinical development, such as the MET inhibitors and antibodies. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the landscape of genomic alterations in lung cancer is expected to be much transformed and detailed in upcoming years. These genomic landscape differences in the context of racial disparities should be emphasized both in tumorigenesis and in drug sensitivity/resistance. It is hoped that such effort will help to diminish racial disparities in lung cancer outcome in the future.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human cancers usually evolve through multistep processes. These processes are driven by the accumulation of abundant genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. However, some lung cancers depend on a single activated oncogene by somatic mutation, termed 'driver oncogenic mutations', for their proliferation and survival. EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangement are typical examples of such driver oncogenic mutations found in lung adenocarcinomas. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or ALK-TKIs significantly improved treatment outcomes compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, respectively. Therefore, treatment strategies for lung cancers have dramatically changed from a 'general and empiric' to a 'personalized and evidence-based' approach according to the driver oncogenic mutation. Several novel driver oncogenic mutations, which are candidates as novel targets, such as ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET, have been discovered. Despite these successes, several limitations have arisen. One example is that some lung cancers do not respond to treatments targeting driver oncogenic mutations, as exemplified in KRAS-mutated lung cancers. Another is resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. Such resistance includes de novo resistance and acquired resistance. A number of molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance have been reported. These mechanisms can be roughly divided into three categories: alteration of the targeted oncogenes themselves by secondary mutations or amplification, activation of an alternative oncogenic signaling track, and conversion of cellular characteristics. Overcoming resistance is a current area of urgent clinical research.",

Histological and genotypic assessment of multifocal lung tumors have been suggested to influence the staging. The aim of this study was to determine the role of morphology and genotype in staging of surgically treated multifocal non-small cell lung carcinoma. Synchronous lung cancers from 60 patients (42 with adenocarcinoma and 18 with squamous cell carcinoma), clinically considered to represent intrapulmonary metastases, were histologically subtyped according to the 2015 World Health Organization classification of lung tumors and subjected to genotypic analysis (KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, MET and ROS1 in adenocarcinoma and PIK3CA and p16 in squamous cell carcinoma). Concordance between clinical criteria and histological subtyping was identified in about 50% of cases (P<0.0001). Genotypically, 44% of adenocarcinomas and 60% of squamous cell carcinomas with identified molecular alterations were considered to be intrapulmonary metastases. Concordance between histological and molecular staging was observed in 89% of adenocarcinomas and 56% of squamous cell carcinomas. Univariate survival analyses failed to demonstrate significant differences in overall or cancer-specific survival in patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomas restaged according to histology and/or molecular profile. Lymph node metastases (N1/N2 vs N0) (P=0.03) and age >65 years (P=0.05) were associated with shorter overall survival. In addition, squamous cell carcinomas with p16 deletion showed shorter overall survival when compared with squamous cell carcinomas without p16 deletion (P=0.05). No correlation between other molecular alterations, clinico-pathological characteristics and prognosis was found. Our study demonstrates that a comprehensive genotypic and morphological assessment of surgically treated multifocal lung cancers is feasible but not sufficient to establish their clonal relationship and prognosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"The natural compound camptothecin (CPT) derivatives have widely been used for anti-cancer treatments, including lung cancer. However, many chemoresistant cancer cells often develop a relatively higher threshold for inducing apoptosis, causing a limited efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. Likewise, lung cancer cells acquire chemoresistance against CPT analogs, such as irinotecan and topotecan, finally resulting in an unsatisfied outcome and poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. TFPP is a quinone-containing compound as a candidate for CPT-based combination chemotherapy. In this study, we examined the effect of TFPP and CPT cotreatment on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Cell proliferation and flow cytometry-based Annexin-V/PI staining assays demonstrated the synergistic effect of TFPP on CPT-induced apoptosis in both NSCLC A549 and H1299 cells. The results of CPT and TFPP cotreatment cause the regulation of the ERK-Bim axis and the activation of mitochondrial-mediated caspase cascade, including caspase-9 and caspase-3. Besides, TFPP significantly enhanced CPT-induced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the two NSCLC cells. In contrast, the treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, rescues the apoptosis of NSCLC cells induced by TFPP and CPT cotreatment, suggesting that the synergistic effect of TFPP on CPT-induced anti-NSCLC cells is through upregulating ROS production. Consequently, our results suggest that TFPP sensitizes NSCLC towards CPT-based chemotherapy may act through decreasing the apoptosis-initiating threshold. Therefore, TFPP may be a promising chemosensitizer for lung cancer treatment, and the underlying mechanism warrants further.",

A strategy to target NSCLC is to identify agents that are effective against NSCLC cells while sparing normal cells. We show that tigecycline, an FDA-approved antibiotic drug, preferentially targets NSCLC cells. Tigecycline is effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of multiple cell lines derived from two common NSCLC subtypes: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Tigecycline also dose-dependently inhibits colony formation of NSCLC subpopulation of cells with highly proliferative and invasive properties. Compared to NSCLC cells, tigecycline affects proliferation and survival of normal fibroblast cells significantly to a less extent. More importantly, tigecycline significantly inhibits NSCLC tumor growth through decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. Tigecycline significantly inhibits mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP levels and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that tigecycline impairs mitochondrial functions. Our study suggests that tigecycline may be a useful therapeutic agent, and inhibiting mitochondrial functions may represent a new targeted therapy for NSCLC. ",

The strongest ROS-inducing activity of grey and red granite was seen in the quartz-containing fractions. In the cytotoxicity tests the quartz-containing fractions of the grey and red granite also caused the strongest lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release. However, plagioclase, the main constituent of black granite (60%), had approximately the same ability to induce ROS as the quartz-containing fractions of red and grey granite.;The cancer morbidity and mortality figures of the three different granite areas, combined with the found differences in biological activity of granite dusts and a hypothesis that there is a cancer-inducing mechanism for ROS, point to a direct role for quartz in cancer induction.",

However, radioresistance is a major obstacle to the success of radiation therapy and contributes significantly to tumor recurrence and treatment failure, highlighting the need for the development of novel radiosensitizers that can be used to overcome tumor radioresistance and, thus, improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous studies indicated that resveratrol (RV) may sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (IR). However, the mechanisms by which RV increases the radiation sensitivity of cancer cells have not been well characterized. Here, we show that RV treatment enhances IR-induced cell killing in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through an apoptosis-independent mechanism. Further studies revealed that the percentage of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive senescent cells was markedly higher in cells treated with IR in combination with RV compared with cells treated either with IR or RV alone, suggesting that RV treatment enhances IR-induced premature senescence in lung cancer cells. Comet assays demonstrate that RV and IR combined treatment causes more DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) than IR or RV treatment alone. DCF-DA staining and flow cytometric analyses demonstrate that RV and IR combined treatment leads to a significant increase in ROS production in irradiated NSCLC cells. Furthermore, our investigation show that inhibition of ROS production by N-acetyl-cysteine attenuates RV-induced radiosensitization in lung cancer cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that RV-induced radiosensitization is associated with significant increase of ROS production, DNA-DSBs and senescence induction in irradiated NSCLC cells, suggesting that RV treatment may sensitize lung cancer cells to radiotherapy via enhancing IR-induced premature senescence.",

Rapid and efficient identification of these alterations is thus becoming increasingly important.;In this study, 121 triple negative lung adenocarcinomas were screened by both IHC with the ROS1 D4D6 antibody, and FISH using two commercially available ROS1 break-apart probes. To address a possible cross-reactivity of the ROS1 antibody with other protein kinase receptors, we screened 80 additional cases with known EGFR, KRAS, PI3KCA, BRAF, HER2 mutations or ALK-rearrangement.;We diagnosed 9 ROS1-rearranged adenocarcinomas, with both a positive FISH result (51-87% rearranged nuclei) and a positive IHC staining (2+/3+ cytoplasmic staining). Only one of the ROS1-positive FISH cases was characterized by a classical split pattern, the others showed a variant pattern, most commonly involving a loss of the 5' telomeric probe. Considering a positivity threshold of 2+ stained cells, the sensitivity of the ROS1 D4D6 antibody compared to FISH was 100% and the specificity 96.9%, as two HER2-mutated tumors were positive with D4D6 antibody, without any translocation in FISH. All the ROS1-positive cases were at an advanced stage, arising in never or light smokers. They were mainly solid cribriform and acinar adenocarcinomas, with signet ring cells noted in 5 cases, and calcifications in 3 cases. One positive case was an invasive mucinous carcinoma.;Our results show that a screening algorithm based on an IHC detection of ROS1 fusion proteins, confirmed if positive or doubtful by a ROS1 break-apart FISH assay, is pertinent in advanced \"triple negative\" lung adenocarcinomas, since the prevalence of ROS1-positive cases in this selected population reaches 7.4% in our series.",

However, whether primary human lung cancer outgrowth could respond to LPS and underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we determined that TLR4 activation with LPS promoted outgrowth of primary human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LPS stimulation increased expression levels of microRNA-21 (miR-21) in primary human lung cancer cells. Inhibition of miR-21 blocked the enhanced lung cancer growth induced by LPS in vitro and in vivo. Up-regulation of miR-21 promoted outgrowth of primary human lung cancer. Down-regulation of miR-21 limited primary human lung cancer outgrowth. Further, TLR4 activation in primary human lung cancer cells increased their ROS levels. Scavenge of ROS abrogated the up-regulation of miR-21 in primary human lung cancer cells and attenuated LPS-induced outgrowth. For in vivo relevance, expression of TLR4 was correlated with miR-21 expression and ROS production in freshly isolated, untreated primary human lung cancer cells. These findings demonstrate an essential role of TLR4/ROS/miR-21 pathway in LPS-induced outgrowth of primary human lung cancer.

LY2801653 was more efficacious than the MET/ALK/RON/ROS inhibitor crizotinib with a distinct pattern of downstream signaling effects.

In classic and orthotopic mouse xenograft models of lung cancer, LY2801653 decreased tumor growth, dramatically inhibiting mitotic events and angiogenesis. Taken together, our results argued that specific targeting of the MET/RON kinases could provide robust inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor outgrowth in multiple in vitro and in vivo models of NSCLC.

The results showed that Fra-1 was overexpressed in the lung cancer tissues when compared with the level in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. To explore the possible mechanism of Fra-1 in lung cancer, we elucidated the effect of Fra-1 on the apoptosis of lung cancer H460 cells, and found that the rate of cell apoptosis was decreased in the H460/Fra-1 cells compared with the H460 or H460/vector cells. Cell apoptosis is closely related with a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations. Our results showed that overexpression of Fra-1 in the lung cancer H460 cells, led to an increase in ΔΨm and and a decrease in intracellular ROS and Ca2+ concentrations. Furthermore, we found that Fra-1 was correlated with dysregulation of the P53 signaling pathway in lung cancer tissues in vitro. At the same time, we found that Fra-1 overexpression affected the expression of MDM2 and P53 in vivo.

To characterize the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK dependence of lung cancers harboring BRAF kinase domain mutations, we screened a large panel of human lung cancer cell lines (n = 87) and tumors (n = 916) for BRAF mutations. We found that non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cells with both V600E and non-V600E BRAF mutations were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with those harboring mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, or ALK and ROS kinase fusions. Supporting its classification as a \"driver\" mutation in the cells in which it is expressed, MEK inhibition in (V600E)BRAF NSCLC cells led to substantial induction of apoptosis, comparable with that seen with EGFR kinase inhibition in EGFR mutant NSCLC models. Despite high basal ERK phosphorylation, EGFR mutant cells were uniformly resistant to MEK inhibition. Conversely, BRAF mutant cell lines were resistant to EGFR inhibition. These data, together with the nonoverlapping pattern of EGFR and BRAF mutations in human lung cancer, suggest that these lesions define distinct clinical entities whose treatment should be guided by prospective real-time genotyping. To facilitate such an effort, we developed a mass spectrometry-based genotyping method for the detection of hotspot mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR. Using this assay, we confirmed that BRAF mutations can be identified in a minority of NSCLC tumors and that patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations have a distinct clinical profile compared with those whose tumors harbor kinase domain mutations in EGFR.",

HGF stimulation of c-Met-overexpressing H69 SCLC cells (40 ng/ml, 15 min) resulted in an increase of ROS, measured with fluorescent probe 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) or dihydroethidine (DHE) but not in c-Met-null H446 cells.

Despite major advances in targeted therapy in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas, the overall 5-year survival rate for lung cancer worldwide has not significantly changed for the last few decades. DNA repair deficiency is known to contribute to lung cancer development. In fact, human polymorphisms in DNA repair genes such as xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) are highly associated with lung cancer incidence. However, the direct genetic evidence for the role of XPC for lung cancer development is still lacking. Mutations of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras) or its downstream effector genes occur in almost all lung cancer cells, and there are a number of mouse models for lung cancer with these mutations. Using activated Kras, Kras(LA1), as a driver for lung cancer development in mice, we showed for the first time that mice with Kras(LA1) and Xpc knockout had worst outcomes in lung cancer development, and this phenotype was associated with accumulated DNA damage. Using cultured cells, we demonstrated that induced expression of oncogenic KRAS(G12V) led to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as DNA damage, and both can be suppressed by anti-oxidants. Our results suggest that XPC may help repair DNA damage caused by KRAS-mediated production of ROS. ",

The Hh signaling pathway has been one of the most intensely investigated targets for cancer therapy, and a number of compounds inhibiting Hh signaling are being tested clinically for treating many cancers. Lung cancer causes more deaths than the next three most common cancers (colon, breast, and prostate) combined. Cyclopamine was the first compound found to inhibit Hh signaling and has been invaluable for understanding the function of Hh signaling in development and cancer. To find novel strategies for combating lung cancer, we decided to characterize the effect of cyclopamine tartrate (CycT), an improved analogue of cyclopamine, on lung cancer cells and its mechanism of action.;The effect of CycT on oxygen consumption and proliferation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines was quantified by using an Oxygraph system and live cell counting, respectively. Apoptosis was detected by using Annexin V and Propidium Iodide staining. CycT's impact on ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology in NSCLC cells was monitored by using fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy. Western blotting and fluorescent microscopy were used to detect the levels and localization of Hh signaling targets, mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, and heme-related proteins in various NSCLC cells.;Our findings identified a novel function of CycT, as well as another Hh inhibitor SANT1, to disrupt mitochondrial function and aerobic respiration. Our results showed that CycT, like glutamine depletion, caused a substantial decrease in oxygen consumption in a number of NSCLC cell lines, suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis. Further, we found that CycT increased ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby disrupting mitochondrial function in NSCLC cells.;Together, our work demonstrates that CycT, and likely other Hh signaling inhibitors, can interrupt NSCLC cell function by promoting mitochondrial fission and fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and ROS generation, thereby diminishing mitochondrial respiration, suppressing cell proliferation, and causing apoptosis. Our work provides novel mechanistic insights into the action of Hh inhibitors in cancer cells.",

To evaluate the antitumor activity of NSC-743380 in lung cancer cells, we analyzed the susceptibility of 50 NSCLC cell lines to this compound using cell viability assay. About 32% (16 of 50) of these cell lines were highly susceptible to this compound, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of < 1 μM. In mechanistic studies, the increased numbers of apoptotic cells as well as increased PARP cleavage showed that cytotoxic effects correlate with apoptosis induction. Treatment with NSC-743380 inhibited transcription factor STAT3 activation and induced ROS production in sensitive human lung cancer cell lines but not in resistant cells. Blocking ROS generation with the antioxidant NDGA dramatically abolished NSC-743380-induced growth suppression and apoptosis, but had minimal effect on NSC-743380-induced STAT3 inhibition, suggesting that STAT3 inhibition is not caused by ROS production. Interestingly, knockdown of STAT3 with use of shSTAT3 induced ROS generation and suppressed tumor cell growth. Moreover, scavenging ROS induced by STAT3 inhibition also diminished antitumor activity of STAT3 inhibition. In vivo administration of NSC-743380 suppressed tumor growth and p-STAT3 in lung tumors. Our results indicate that NSC-743380 is a potent anticancer agent for lung cancer and that its apoptotic effects in lung cancer cells are mediated by induction of ROS through STAT3 inhibition.",

We evaluated the effects of the two potential antitumor agents of the lamellarin class on a highly apoptosis-resistant NSCLC cell line. Both the marine alkaloid lamellarin-D and its synthetic amino derivative PM031379 induced the activation of Bax, the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), as well as the activation of caspase-3. However, only PM031379 triggered cell death and sign of nuclear apoptosis coupled to the nuclear translocation of AIF. Depletion of AIF with small interfering RNA or microinjection of a neutralizing anti-AIF antibody largely prevented PM031379-induced cytotoxicity, underscoring the essential contribution of AIF to NSCLC killing. Using NSCLC cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, we showed that the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) was crucial for the PM031379-induced translocation of AIF to the nucleus and subsequently cell death. Pretreatment of NSCLC cells with menadione, a mitochondrial ROS generator, was able to restore the deficient chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Altogether, these data suggest that mitochondrial ROS generation is crucial for overriding the chemoresistance of NSCLC cells. Moreover, this study delineates the unique mechanism of action of lamellarins as potential anticancer agents.",

In this study, cytotoxic activity of fascaplysin against a panel of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and putative synergism with chemotherapeutics was investigated. SCLC responds to first-line chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs/etoposide, but relapses early with topotecan remaining as the single approved therapeutic agent. Fascaplysin was found to show high cytotoxicity against SCLC cells and to induce cell cycle arrest in G1/0 at lower and S-phase at higher concentrations, respectively. The compound generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced apoptotic cell death in the chemoresistant NCI-H417 SCLC cell line. Furthermore, fascaplysin revealed marked synergism with the topoisomerase I-directed camptothecin and 10-hydroxy-camptothecin. The Poly(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor BYK 204165 antagonized the cytotoxic activity of fascaplysin, pointing to the involvement of DNA repair in response to the anticancer activity of the drug.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation-related biological processes, such as energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, have been considered to be associated with tumorigenesis and drug resistance. It was hypothesized and demonstrated, in the present study, that mitochondrial dysfunction is the reason for the occurrence and progression of SCLC. mtDNA from drug sensitive and drug insensitive cell lines (H446 and H446/CDDP) was sequenced and compared with the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS). The results revealed that there was no difference in the mtDNA sequence from H446 and H446/CDDP cells, but several spot mutations were observed according to that of rCRs. Further evaluation on mitochondrial function revealed that H446 cells synthesized and secreted more lactic acid and ROS compared with that of H446/CDDP cells when challenged by the same dose of cisplatin (P>0.05). In addition, examination of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indicated that more Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were expressed in H446 cells compared with that of H446/CDDP cells when stimulated by the same dose of cisplatin (P>0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that mtDNA mutations were responsible for the tumorigenesis of SLCL, but not associated with the drug sensitivity of SCLC cell lines. On the other hand, varied mitochondrium content‑related mitochondrial dysfunction participated in the MDR of SCLC possibly by affecting the ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Redox adaptation is an important concept that explains the mechanisms by which cancer cells survive under persistent endogenous oxidative stress and become resistant to certain anticancer agents. To investigate this concept, we determined the expression levels of peroxiredoxins (Prxs), antioxidant enzymes in drug-resistant non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. Prx II was remarkably increased only in A549/GR (gefitinib-resistant) cells compared with A549 cells, consistent with methylation/demethylation. Prx II was highly methylated in the A549 cells but was demethylated in the A549/GR cells. The elevated expression of Prx II resulted in the downregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death and upregulation of cell cycle progression in the A549/GR cells. When Prx II mRNA in the A549/GR cells was knocked down, the levels of ROS and apoptosis were significantly recovered to the levels of the controls. In addition, signaling molecules involved in apoptosis were increased in the A549/GR-shPrx II cells. There was no difference in the expression of MAPK/ERK between the A549/GR cells and A549/GR-shPrx II cells, but the phosphorylation of JNK was increased in the A549/GR cells and was markedly decreased in the A549/GR-shPrx II cells. Colony number and tumor growth were significantly decreased in the A549/GR-shPrx II cells compared with the A549/GR cells. Our findings suggest that Prx II has an important role in cancer cell survival via the modulation of signaling molecules involved in apoptosis and the phosphorylation of JNK by the downregulation of ROS levels in A549/GR cells.

We performed a biopsy of a resistant tumor and identified an acquired mutation leading to a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 2032 in the ROS1 kinase domain. Although this mutation does not lie at the gatekeeper residue, it confers resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through steric interference with drug binding.

Here, we synthesized phospho-ibuprofen amide (PIA), a metabolically stable analog of phospho-ibuprofen, formulated it in nanocarriers, and evaluated its pharmacokinetics and anticancer efficacy in pre-clinical models of human lung cancer. PIA was 10-fold more potent than ibuprofen in suppressing the growth of human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, an effect mediated by favorably altering cytokinetics and inducing oxidative stress. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats revealed that liposome-encapsulated PIA exhibited remarkable resistance to hydrolysis by carboxylesterases, remaining largely intact in the systemic circulation, and demonstrated selective distribution to the lungs. The antitumor activity of liposomal PIA was evaluated in a metastatic model of human NSCLC in mice. Liposomal PIA strongly inhibited lung tumorigenesis (>95%) and was significantly (p<0.05) more efficacious than ibuprofen. We observed a significant induction of urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2αin vivo, which indicates that ROS stress probably plays an important role in mediating the antitumor efficacy of PIA.

Tumor genotype, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes were collected and studied at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between age and mutation status, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for survival analysis.;The frequency of targetable genomic alterations by defined age categories as well as the association of these age groups with survival. Age categories used in this analysis were younger than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years or older.;A cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC was studied. Of the 2237 participants, 1939 (87%) had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, 269 (12%) had NSCLC not otherwise specified, and 29 (1%) had squamous histologic findings; 1396 (63%) had either stage IIIB or IV cancers; and median (range) age was 62 (20-95) years. We found that gene mutations for EGFR (P = .02) and ALK (P < .001) were associated with cancer diagnosis at a younger age, and a similar trend existed for ERBB2 (P = .15) and ROS1 (P = .10) but not BRAF V600E (P = .43). Among patients tested for all 5 targetable genomic alterations (n = 1325), younger age was associated with an increased frequency of a targetable genotype (P < .001). Those diagnosed at 50 years or younger have a 59% increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype.

Ultimately, however, patients fatally relapse. In this review we will focus on the search to improve survival for NSCLC patients deemed to be pan-negative for the common driver alterations susceptible to targeted therapy, above all those with EGFR mutations or ALK, ROS or RET translocations. Other uncommon driver mutations such as HER2 and BRAF mutations should be tested in order to rule out targeted treatment before assigning patients to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy yields short lived response with median survival still less than one year. Customized chemotherapy represents one way to attempt to prolong survival, although to date no prospective randomized customized studies have reported sufficient evidence to support this. In one attempt to demonstrate the role of tailoring chemotherapy, the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) phase II customized chemotherapy trial (NCT00883480) showed that RAP80, a component of the BRCA1-A complex, influenced outcome in patients with low BRCA1 expression treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine, and in patients with intermediate/high BRCA1 levels receiving cisplatin/docetaxel or docetaxel alone.

All the patients were evaluated for MET expression status. MET-positive was defined as having an H-score ≥ 60 by immunohistochemistry analysis. MET expression was analyzed in 158 patients who were negative for the common driver genes, including EGFR, ALK, KRAS and ROS1. A chi-squared test was used to assess the clinicopathological parameters. Multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.;MET data were available for analysis in 158 advanced NSCLC patients. Of these, based on the MET H-score criteria, the IHC-positive rate was 48.1% (76/158). There were more patients with adenocarcinoma in the MET-positive group compared with the MET-negative group (P=0.01). Nine patients with lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma had no MET expression. There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between MET-positive and -negative patients. There was also no significant difference in the efficacy (Z=-0.44, P=0.66) or progression free survival (PFS) of first-line chemotherapy between the MET-positive and -negative patients (mPFS 6.8 months [95% CI: 5.4-8.2] vs. 5.9 months [5.5-6.3], P=0.92). In the cell model, the MET-positive cell showed no difference in chemotherapy but with a increase in percentage of growth inhibition upon treatment with MET inhibitor INC280 compared to MET-negative cell.;Our data showed that de novo MET expression was not rare.

However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the potential role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling enhanced NSCLC metastasis. NSCLC cells were isolated from clinical surgical tissues. We found that LPS stimulation of NSCLC cells facilitates their metastasis that was accompanied by increased ROS production and could be abrogated by ROS inhibition. NADPH oxidase was essential for TLR4 signaling-enhanced NSCLC metastasis. Elevated NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) expression by LPS stimulation was observed. Blockade of NOX1 with ML171 alleviated enhanced NSCLC metastasis by TLR4 signaling. Enforced NOX1 expression promoted TLR4 signaling-enhanced NSCLC metastasis, while decreased NOX1 expression inhibited TLR4 signaling-enhanced NSCLC metastasis. Further, NOX1 could regulate the expression of CXCR4 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) in NSCLC cells. NOX1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with TLR4 expression and clinical stages in NSCLC patients. Finally, inhibition of NOX1/ROS prevented enhanced lung tumor burdens of NSCLC by LPS-induced acute lung infection. Our findings demonstrated a crucial role of NOX1-dependent ROS for TLR4 signaling to enhance the metastasis of NSCLC, which could further the understanding of NSCLC pathogenesis and helpful for developing novel therapeutics for NSCLC.",

To facilitate genotyping, we developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay using a desktop sequencer to detect actionable mutations and rearrangements in cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA).;An NGS panel was developed targeting 11 driver oncogenes found in NSCLC. Targeted NGS was performed using a novel methodology that maximizes on-target reads, and minimizes artifact, and was validated on DNA dilutions derived from cell lines. Plasma NGS was then blindly performed on 48 patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC and a known tumor genotype, and explored in two patients with incomplete tumor genotyping.;NGS could identify mutations present in DNA dilutions at ≥ 0.4% allelic frequency with 100% sensitivity/specificity. Plasma NGS detected a broad range of driver and resistance mutations, including ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements, HER2 insertions, and MET amplification, with 100% specificity. Sensitivity was 77% across 62 known driver and resistance mutations from the 48 cases; in 29 cases with common EGFR and KRAS mutations, sensitivity was similar to droplet digital PCR. In two cases with incomplete tumor genotyping, plasma NGS rapidly identified a novel EGFR exon 19 deletion and a missed case of MET amplification.;Blinded to tumor genotype, this plasma NGS approach detected a broad range of targetable genomic alterations in NSCLC with no false positives including complex mutations like rearrangements and unexpected resistance mutations such as EGFR C797S.

Specific major or frequent side effects of crizotinib are discussed: visual disturbances, cardiac effects, elevated transaminases, and hypogonadism. In the routine practice, patients should be advised about visual disturbances, especially with regard to driving in low brightness. Digestive disorders related to crizotinib are exceptionally persistent or severe. Dietary measures and symptomatic treatments usually control these disorders. It is recommended to perform an electrocardiogram before introduction of crizotinib, to identify prolonged QT interval. Torsades de pointes may produce dizziness or syncope. Hypogonadism should be considered in case of fatigue, decreased libido, and even depression, taking into account that these symptoms may be related to cancer; testosterone serum level should be measured to identify patients that may be eligible to receive a supplementation. Monitoring of liver function tests, including transaminases and bilirubin, is necessary. To conclude, these practical elements are helpful to optimize treatment with crizotinib in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer; in the future, academic initiatives should be taken to study these aspects, based on the monitoring of large cohorts of patients treated with crizotinib.

Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-mediated immune escape may be an underlying source of resistance and a suitable target for specific therapy, but its role in PPCs is unclear.;In total, 122 PPCs were investigated. Paraffin-embedded tumour sections were stained with PD-L1 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) antibodies. Overexpression was denoted by moderate-to-strong PD-L1 membrane staining in ≥5% of tumour cells and HIF-1α nuclear staining in ≥10% of tumour cells.

High PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with that of HIF-1α (p < 0.001) and tumour necrosis (p < 0.001). HIF-1α expression was associated with EGFR mutation (p = 0.015). Advanced stage and high PD-L1 expression were two independent risks for poor overall survival.;High PD-L1 and HIF-1α co-expression was observed in PPCs compared with their expression in conventional non-small-cell lung carcinoma. The aggressive behaviour of PPC could be partially related to PD-L1-mediated immune escape and intratumoural hypoxia. High PD-L1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and may provide a rationale for the use of targeted immunotherapy in this subtype of high-grade PPC.",

Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DDH1) and thioredoxin knockdowns were prepared by standard techniques.;Cisplatin treatment of a cervical cancer cell line resulted in ROS production with mitochondrial membrane depolarization and phosphorylation of JNK and p38. N-acetyl-cysteine, a free radical scavenger, ameliorated these effects. Treatment of the sensitive cells with H2O2 produced similar effects but at shorter incubation times. Similar results were observed with an ovarian cell line. Downregulation of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in the cisplatin-resistant cervical and lung cancer cell lines resulted in increased drug sensitivity with detectable production of ROS and activation of the JNK/p38 pathways; however, downregulation of thioredoxin in the cervical cells had minimal effect.;Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase appears to play a role in cisplatin resistance in cervical, ovarian and lung cancer cells which includes mitochondrial membrane depolarization, ROS production and activation of the JNK pathway.

Respiratory lung cells are subject to the ROS that causes DNA breaks, which subsequently bring about DNA mutagenesis and are intimately linked with carcinogenesis. The damaged cells by oxidative stress are often destroyed through the active apoptotic pathway. However, the ROS also perform critical signaling functions in stress responses, cell survival, and cell proliferation. Some molecules enhance radiation-induced tumor cell killing via the reduction in DNA repair levels. Hence the DNA repair levels may be a novel therapeutic modality in overcoming drug resistance in lung cancer. Either survival or apoptosis, which is determined by the balance between DNA damage and DNA repair levels, may lender the major problems in cancer therapy.

Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents.

Recently, several studies have shown that curcumin inhibits the expansion of MDSCs in some cancers. However, it is not clear how curcumin modulates the suppressive function of MDSCs, and whether curcumin achieves anti-tumor effects via regulating the expansion of MDSCs in lung cancer. Here, our results showed that curcumin significantly inhibited tumor growth in a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) isogenic tumor model. Curcumin reduced the accumulation of MDSCs in spleen and tumor tissue in LLC isogenic model. And curcumin promoted the maturation and differentiation of MDSCs in tumor tissue. Notably, curcumin inhibited the expression level of immune suppressive factors of MDSCs, arginase-1 (Arg-1) and ROS, in purified MDSCs from tumor tissue in vivo. Expectedly, curcumin also inhibited the immunosuppressive function of isolated MDSCs from tumor tissue and spleen of tumor bearing mice in vitro. Moreover, curcumin decreased the level of IL-6 in the tumor tissue and serum from LLC-bearing mice. Taken together, curcumin indeed possesses anti-cancer effect and inhibits the accumulation and function of MDSCs. And curcumin reduces the level of IL-6 in tumor-bearing mice to impair the expansion and function of MDSCs.

Patients treated with current chemotherapies for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have a survival rate of approximately 15% after 5 years. Novel approaches are needed to treat this disease. We show elevated NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) levels in tumors from NSCLC patients. beta-Lapachone, an effective chemotherapeutic and radiosensitizing agent, selectively killed NSCLC cells that expressed high levels of NQO1. Isogenic H596 NSCLC cells that lacked or expressed NQO1 along with A549 NSCLC cells treated with or without dicoumarol, were used to elucidate the mechanism of action and optimal therapeutic window of beta-lapachone. NSCLC cells were killed in an NQO1-dependent manner by beta-lapachone (LD50, approximately 4 microM) with a minimum 2-h exposure. Kinetically, beta-lapachone-induced cell death was characterized by the following: (i) dramatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, eliciting extensive DNA damage; (ii) hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1); (iii) depletion of NAD+/ATP levels; and (iv) proteolytic cleavage of p53/PARP-1, indicating mu-calpain activation and apoptosis. Beta-lapachone-induced PARP-1 hyperactivation, nucleotide depletion, and apoptosis were blocked by 3-aminobenzamide, a PARP-1 inhibitor, and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), a Ca2+ chelator. NQO1- cells (H596, IMR-90) or dicoumarol-exposed NQO1+ A549 cells were resistant (LD50, >40 microM) to ROS formation and all cytotoxic effects of beta-lapachone. Our data indicate that the most efficacious strategy using beta-lapachone in chemotherapy was to deliver the drug in short pulses, greatly reducing cytotoxicity to NQO1- \"normal\" cells. beta-Lapachone killed cells in a tumorselective manner and is indicated for use against NQO1+ NSCLC cancers.",

This seems to reduce transport of the enzyme into mitochondria, decreasing its defense capacity against oxidative stress. The present case-control study was conducted to investigate the association of SOD2 genetic polymorphism with individual susceptibility to lung cancer. Ala16Val polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping, and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques in 100 lung cancer patients and 50 healthy control subjects. The frequency of the Val allele (OR=1.297, 95% CI=1.095-1.536) and the Val/Val genotype (OR=7.00, 95% CI=2.282-21.476) was significantly higher in lung cancer patients than in control subjects. There was a combined effect of Val/Val genotype as a genetic factor with smoking as an environment factor (OR=2.24).

Previous studies demonstrated that the increased mtDNA copy number for compensation for damage, which was associated with cigarette smoking, has been found to be associated with lung cancer risk among heavy smokers. Given that the common and \"non-pathological\" mtDNA variations determine differences in oxidative phosphorylation performance and ROS production, an important determinant of lung cancer risk, we hypothesize that the mtDNA variations may play roles in lung cancer risk. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study to compare the frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups and an 822 bp mtDNA deletion between 422 lung cancer patients and 504 controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that haplogroups D and F were related to individual lung cancer resistance (OR = 0.465, 95%CI = 0.329-0.656, p<0.001; and OR = 0.622, 95%CI = 0.425-0.909, p = 0.014, respectively), while haplogroups G and M7 might be risk factors for lung cancer (OR = 3.924, 95%CI = 1.757-6.689, p<0.001; and OR = 2.037, 95%CI = 1.253-3.312, p = 0.004, respectively). Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that cigarette smoking was a risk factor for the 822 bp mtDNA deletion. Furthermore, the increased frequencies of the mtDNA deletion in male cigarette smoking subjects of combined cases and controls with haplogroup D indicated that the haplogroup D might be susceptible to DNA damage from external ROS caused by heavy cigarette smoking.",

In this regard, 2-Deoxy d-glucose (2-dDG) has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation by intervening the glycolytic pathway. However, phase I clinical trial of 2-dDG demonstrated cardiac side effects at higher dosage. Metformin (Met), on the other hand, has been reported to improve pathological response to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we propose that combination therapy of 2-dDG with Met will demonstrate enhanced cytotoxicity than either compound alone. Our results indicated that inhibition concentration 25 (IC25) for combined treatment of Met and 2-dDG showed more toxicity as compared to individual agents on a NSCLC cell line, A549. This augmented toxicity is associated with increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione level as well as decreased super oxide dismutase and catalase activities. Combination of Met and 2-dDG also demonstrated enhanced DNA damage, DNA adduct formation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and mitochondrial membrane potential alteration, as well as increased apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, P-p38 and P-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) level. It was also shown that inhibition of caspase-3 and p38 kinase partially (75%-87%) reversed Met and 2-dDG induced cell death, without affecting the ROS levels. On the other hand, pre-treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reversed Met and 2-dDG induced cell death to >90%. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated that combination of Met and 2-dDG showed better toxicity than individual compounds and cell death is ROS, P-p38 and caspase-3 mediated, thereby providing a proof of concept for the combination of Met and 2-dDG as a potential treatment protocol for NSCLC.",

Constitutive activation of Nrf2 in lung cancer cells promotes tumorigenicity and contributes to chemoresistance by upregulation of glutathione, thioredoxin, and the drug efflux pathways involved in detoxification of electrophiles and broad spectrum of drugs. In this study, we show that RNAi-mediated lowering of Nrf2 levels in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549 and H460) led to a dramatic increase in endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Similarly, γ-irradiation-induced formation of protein carbonyls were significantly higher in Nrf2-depleted lung cancer cells, suggesting increased lethality of ionizing radiation in the absence of Nrf2. Radiation-induced protein oxidation in Nrf2shRNA cells correlated with reduced survival as measured by clonogenic assay. Radiation-induced cell death was abrogated by pretreatment with antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine, glutathione, and vitamin-E, highlighting the importance of antioxidants in conferring protection against radiation injury. Using genetically-modified gain and loss of function models of Nrf2, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we establish that constitutive activation of Nrf2 protects against ionizing radiation toxicity and confers radioresistance. Thus, targeting Nrf2 activity in radioresistant tumors could be a promising strategy to circumvent radioresistance.",

However, radiation as a lung cancer treatment remains far from satisfactory due to problems associated with radiation resistance in cancer cells and severe cytotoxicity to non-cancer cells, which arise at doses typically administered to patients. We have recently identified a promising novel inhibitor of β-catenin/Tcf4 interaction, named BC-23 (C21H14ClN3O4S), which acts as a potent cell death enhancer when used in combination with radiation. Sequential exposure of human p53-null non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H1299 cells to low doses of x-ray radiation, followed 1 hour later by administration of minimally cytotoxic concentrations of BC-23, resulted in a highly synergistic induction of clonogenic cell death (combination index <1.0). Co-treatment with BC-23 at low concentrations effectively inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and down-regulates c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression. S phase arrest and ROS generation are also involved in the enhancement of radiation effectiveness mediated by BC-23. BC-23 therefore represents a promising new class of radiation enhancer. ",

Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect cell cycle changes. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V/PI double-staining and the DNA ladder formation assays. The expressions of the apoptosis-related proteins were analysed by western blot. The in vivo efficacy of PA was measured using a NCI-H23 xenograft model in nude mice.;PA exhibited anti-tumor effects in vitro accompanied by induction of G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in NCI-H23 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, our data showed that PA induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in the activation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptotic pathways in lung cancer cells. Moreover, blockage of ROS production reversed PA-induced JNK and ER stress activation. Finally, PA inhibited the growth of NCI-H23 xenograft tumors without causing any host toxicity, and inhibited cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis of tumor cells in tumor xenograft tissues.;In summary, our study demonstrates that PA induces apoptosis through activation of the JNK and ER stress pathways in human lung cancer cells.

However, whether the crosstalk of NOX4 and IL-6 signalings exists in NSCLC remains undentified. In this study, we show that NOX4 expression is positively correlated with IL-6 expression in NSCLC tissues. Exogenous IL-6 treatment significantly enhances NOX4/ROS/Akt signaling in NSCLC cells. NOX4 also enhances IL-6 production and activates IL-6/STAT3 signaling in NSCLC cells. Specifically, NOX4 is confirmed to functionally interplay with IL-6 to promote NSCLC cell proliferation and survival. The in vivo results were similar to those obtained in vitro. These data indicate a novel NOX4-dependent link among IL-6 in the NSCLC microenvironment, oxidative stress in NSCLC cells and autocrined IL-6 in NSCLC cells. NOX4/Akt and IL-6/STAT3 signalings can reciprocally and positively regulate each other, leading to enhanced NSCLC cell proliferation and survival. Therefore, NOX4 may serve as a promising target against NSCLC alone with IL-6 signaling. ",

We show that levofloxacin is effectively against a panel of lung cancer cell lines via inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis, regardless of cellular origin and genetic pattern, in in vitro cell culture system and in vivo xenograft lung tumor model. Mechanistically, levofloxacin inhibits activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I and III, leading to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and reduction of ATP production. In addition, levofloxacin significantly increases levels of ROS, mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in vitro and oxidative stress markers (HEL and 4-HNE) in vivo. Antioxidants, such as NAC and vitamin C, prevent the inhibitory effects of levofloxacin, confirming the induction of oxidative damage as the mechanism of its action in lung cancer cells. Our work demonstrates that levofloxacin is a useful addition to the treatment of lung cancer.

The aim of this study was to analyze the enzyme activity of MnSOD in blood of lung cancer patients with a smoking history in relationship to oxidative stress. Samples were taken from leukocyte cells of 20 lung cancer patients in Persahabatan Hospital Jakarta. Control groups included 50 healthy smokers and 50 non smokers, all aged over 40 years. The MnSOD activity determined biochemically based on the inhibition of xanthin oxidase, of lung cancer patients was lower than the control group's (p<0.001). Plasma MDA levels, determined by reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA), were not significantly different (p=0.479), whereas plasma carbonyl levels were elevated (p=0.003). Free radical production in lung cancer patients thus appeared high. Smoker controls also tended to exhibit lower MnSOD and higher carbonyl radicals than their non-smoking counterparts. Continue cigarette smoke exposure may increase production of ROS and bring about a reduction of MnSOD, which could play a role in lung cancer development.",

Thiol compounds (N-acetylcysteine and N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine) and free radical scavengers reduced MG132-induced cell death. Antioxidants, including N-acetylcysteine, inhibited the MG132-induced nuclear damage, loss in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. Depletion of GSH due to buthionine sulfoxime did not affect the cell viability loss, ROS formation and GSH depletion due to MG132 in SCLC cells. A thiol oxidant monochloramine, p-chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleiamide also did not affect cytotoxicity of MG132.

Rh123 staining assay indicated that GPX reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. DCFH-DA staining revealed that intracellular ROS increased with GPX treatment. Moreover, GPX cleaved and activated caspase-3. In summary, this study showed that GPX inhibited H520 cell proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manner.

Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors used primarily for hyperlidpidemia, have been studied for their antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. However, the effects of simvastatin on pemetrexed-induced apoptosis have not been investigated. In this study, we investigated whether combination treatment with pemetrexed and simvastatin potentiates the apoptotic activity above that is seen with either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC cells. We found that the combination of pemetrexed and simvastatin induced more extensive caspase-dependent apoptosis than either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma cells (MSTO-211) or NSCLC cells (A549). In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cells treated with both pemetrexed and simvastatin was markedly increased compared to cells treated with either pemetrexed or simvastatin alone. Combination treatment also increased the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and altered expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) families of apoptosis related proteins. On the other hand, pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction by pemetrexed and simvastatin. In addition, Bim siRNA conferred protection against apoptosis induced by pemetrexed and simvastatin. These results suggest that combination of pemetrexed and simvastatin potentiates their apoptotic activity beyond that of either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer cells.

Increased sub-G1 phase cells and enhanced PARP cleavage demonstrated that the sequence of CDDP-GA treatment markedly increased apoptosis in comparison with other treatments. Furthermore, the sequential combination could enhance the activation of caspase-3, -8, and 9, increase the expression of Fas and Bax, and decrease the expression of Bcl-2, survivin and X-inhibitor of apoptosis protein (X-IAP) in A549 and NCI-H460 cell lines. In addition, increased apoptosis was correlated with enhanced reactive oxygen species generation. Importantly, it was found that, followed by CDDP treatment, GA could inhibit NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signalling pathways, which have been validated to reduce ROS release and confer CDDP resistance. The roles of NF-κB and MAPK pathways were further confirmed by using specific inhibitors, which significantly increased ROS release and apoptosis induced by the sequential combination of CDDP and GA. Moreover, our results indicated that the combination of CDDP and GA exerted increased antitumour effects on A549 xenograft models through inhibiting NF-κB, HO-1, and subsequently inducing apoptosis.;Gambogic acid sensitises lung cancer cells to CDDP in vitro and in vivo in NSCLC through inactivation of NF-κB and MAPK/HO-1 signalling pathways, providing a rationale for the combined use of CDDP and GA in lung cancer chemotherapy.",

Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay. Apoptosis was confirmed by annexin-V/propidium iodide staining and caspase activity assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δφm) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by flow cytometry. Depletion of p53 was achieved by transfection of specific small interfering RNA. Gene expression changes were determined by Western blot analysis. Zerumbone treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of A549 and H460 NSCLC cell viability. Zerumbone-induced mitochondrial apoptosis of NSCLC cells, evidenced loss of Δφm, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 and -3. There was increased p53 and Bax expression and ROS production in zerumbone-treated cells. Downregulation of p53 or scavenging ROS interfered with the pro-apoptotic action of zerumbone. Combinational treatment with zerumbone and cisplatin significantly accelerated apoptosis and promoted p53 expression and ROS production in NSCLC cells, compared with each alone. These findings demonstrate that zerumbone induces mitochondrial apoptosis and enhances the susceptibility to cisplatin in NSCLC cells, which are, at least partially, mediated through activation of p53 signaling and promotion of ROS generation.

PKD activation induced by PDB in these SCLC cell lines was completely abrogated by treatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (GF I) at concentrations (0.5-2.5 microM) that did not inhibit PKD activity when added directly to the in vitro kinase assays.

Epidemiological evidence is ambiguous and conflicting. Experimental data show that high levels of CS cause lung cancer in rats, although not in other species, including mice, guinea pigs, or hamsters; but the relevance of such animal data to humans has been uncertain. This article applies recent insights into the toxicology of lung diseases caused by poorly soluble particles (PSPs), and by CS in particular, to model the exposure-response relation between CS and risk of lung pathologies such as chronic inflammation, silicosis, fibrosis, and lung cancer. An inflammatory mode of action is described, having substantial empirical support, in which exposure increases alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the alveolar epithelium, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, and eventual damage to lung tissue and epithelial hyperplasia, resulting in fibrosis and increased lung cancer risk among silicotics. This mode of action involves several positive feedback loops. Exposures that increase the gain factors around such loops can create a disease state with elevated levels of ROS, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils. This mechanism implies a \"tipping point\" threshold for the exposure-response relation. Applying this new model to epidemiological data, we conclude that current permissible exposure levels, on the order of 0.1 mg/m³, are probably below the threshold for triggering lung diseases in humans.",

Migration and invasion are prerequisite processes associated with high metastasis potential in cancers. Moscatilin, a bibenzyl derivative isolated from the Thai orchid Dendrobium pulchellum, has been shown to have anticancer effect against numerous cancer cell lines. However, little is known regarding the effect of moscatilin on cancer cell migration and invasion. The present study demonstrates that nontoxic concentrations of moscatilin were able to inhibit human nonsmall cell lung cancer H23 cell migration and invasion. The inhibitory effect of moscatilin was associated with an attenuation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), in which hydroxyl radical (OH(∙)) was identified as a dominant species in the suppression of filopodia formation. Western blot analysis also revealed that moscatilin downregulated activated focal adhesion kinase (phosphorylated FAK, Tyr 397) and activated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (phosphorylated Akt, Ser 473), whereas their parental counterparts were not detectable changed. In conclusion, our results indicate the novel molecular basis of moscalitin-inhibiting lung cancer cell motility and invasion and demonstrate a promising antimetastatic potential of such an agent for lung cancer therapy.",

Thus, AA has potential uses as a chemotherapeutic agent alone or in combination with other therapeutics that specifically target cancer-cell metabolism. We compared the effects of AA and combinations of AA with the glycolysis inhibitor 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3-PO) on the viability of three non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to the effects on an immortalized lung epithelial cell line. AA concentrations of 0.5 to 5 mM caused a complete loss of viability in all NSCLC lines compared to a <10% loss of viability in the lung epithelial cell line. Combinations of AA and 3-PO synergistically enhanced cell death in all NSCLC cell lines at concentrations well below the IC50 concentrations for each compound alone. A synergistic interaction was not observed in combination treatments of lung epithelial cells and combination treatments that caused a complete loss of viability in NSCLC cells had modest effects on normal lung cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Combination treatments induced dramatically higher ROS levels compared to treatment with AA and 3-PO alone in NSCLC cells and combination-induced cell death was inhibited by addition of catalase to the medium. Analyses of DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, annexin V-binding, and caspase activity demonstrated that AA-induced cell death is caused via the activation of apoptosis and that the combination treatments caused a synergistic induction of apoptosis. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AA against NSCLC cells and that combinations of AA with 3-PO synergistically induce apoptosis via a ROS-dependent mechanism. These results support further evaluation of pharmacologic concentrations of AA as an adjuvant treatment for NSCLC and that combination of AA with glycolysis inhibitors may be a promising therapy for the treatment of NSCLC.",

Numerous studies have shown that CTD induced cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. However, there is no report to demonstrate that CTD induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the effect of CTD on the cell death via the induction of apoptosis in H460 human lung cancer cells. Flow cytometry assay was used for examining the percentage of cell viability, sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca²⁺ productions and the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm). Annexin V/PI staining and DNA gel electrophoresis were also used for examining cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to examine the changes of apoptosis associated protein expression and confocal microscopy for examining the translocation apoptosis associated protein. Results indicated that CTD significantly induced cell morphological changes and decreased the percentage of viable H460 cells. CTD induced apoptosis based on the occurrence of sub-G1 phase and DNA fragmentation. We found that CTD increased gene expression (mRNA) of caspase-3 and -8. Moreover, CTD increased ROS and Ca2+ production and decreased the levels of ∆Ψm. Western blot analysis results showed that CTD increased the expression of cleavage caspase-3 and -8, cytochrome c, Bax and AIF but inhibited the levels of Bcl-xL. CTD promoted ER stress associated protein expression such as GRP78, IRE1α, IRE1β, ATF6α and caspase-4 and it also promoted the expression of calpain 2 and XBP-1, but inhibited calpain 1 that is associated with apoptosis pathways. Based on those observations, we suggest that CTD may be used as a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of lung cancer in the future.",

The synthetic PPARγ ligands, troglitazone and ciglitazone, inhibit tumor progression in many cells by PPARγ activation, but the mechanism of 15d-PGJ(2) is still unclear.

Results showed that 15d-PGJ(2) induced apoptosis, which was associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decrease of GSH levels. Furthermore, quercetin reduced the activity of caspases in 15d-PGJ(2)-induced apoptotic processes.

        "Doc_abstract":"Both occupational and environmental exposure to particles is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Particles are thought to impact on genotoxicity as well as on cell proliferation via their ability to generate oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). For mechanistic purposes, one should discriminate between a) the oxidant-generating properties of particles themselves (i.e., acellular), which are mostly determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the particle surface, and b) the ability of particles to stimulate cellular oxidant generation. Cellular ROS/RNS can be generated by various mechanisms, including particle-related mitochondrial activation or NAD(P)H-oxidase enzymes. In addition, since particles can induce an inflammatory response, a further subdivision needs to be made between primary (i.e., particle-driven) and secondary (i.e., inflammation-driven) formation of oxidants. Particles may also affect genotoxicity by their ability to carry surface-adsorbed carcinogenic components into the lung. Each of these pathways can impact on genotoxicity and proliferation, as well as on feedback mechanisms involving DNA repair or apoptosis. Although abundant evidence suggests that ROS/RNS mediate particle-induced genotoxicity and mutagenesis, little information is available towards the subsequent steps leading to neoplastic changes. Additionally, since most of the proposed molecular mechanisms underlying particle-related carcinogenesis have been derived from in vitro studies, there is a need for future studies that evaluate the implication of these mechanisms for in vivo lung cancer development. In this respect, transgenic and gene knockout animal models may provide a useful tool. Such studies should also include further assessment of the relative contributions of primary (inflammation-independent) and secondary (inflammation-driven) pathways.",

Although antagonist G blocks SCLC cell growth (IC50 = 24.5 +/- 1.5 and 38.5 +/- 1.5 microM for the H69 and H510 cell lines respectively), its exact mechanism of action is unclear. This study shows that antagonist G stimulates apoptosis as assessed by morphology (EC50 = 5.9 +/- 0.1 and 15.2 +/- 2.7 microM for the H69 and H510 cell lines respectively) and stimulates c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in SCLC cells (EC50 = 3.2 +/- 0.1 and 15.2 +/- 2.7 microM). This activity is neuropeptide-independent, but dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is inhibited by the free radical scavenger n-acetyl cysteine. Furthermore, antagonist G itself induces inflammation (59% increase in oedema volume compared to control) and potentiates (by 35-40%) bradykinin-induced oedema formation in vivo. In view of these results we show that, as well as acting as a 'broad-spectrum' neuropeptide antagonist, antagonist G stimulates basal G-protein activity in SCLC cell membranes (81 +/- 12% stimulation at 10 microM), thereby displaying a unique ability to stimulate certain signal transduction pathways by activating G-proteins.

CuE induced apoptosis as determined by JC-1 staining, expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, cleavage of caspases, and TUNEL staining. NAC and Ac-DEVD-CHO partially reversed CuE-induced cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP. Furthermore, CuE caused accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and concentration- and time-dependent expression of LC3II protein. Autophagy inhibitors chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 enhanced CuE-induced LC3II expression and cell death. CuE-triggered protein expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, Beclin-1, and p-ULK1 was partially reversed by NAC pretreatment. In addition, CuE treatment damaged F-actin without affecting β-tubulin as confirmed by immunofluorescence.

Here we showed that SPC treatment triggered necrosis and autophagy but inhibited apoptosis in two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines: A549 cell line and H157 cell line. Then 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, was introduced to clarify the relationships between autophagy and necrosis or apoptosis. 3MA suppressed the survival furtherly by promoting apoptosis while had no influence on necrosis. Subsequent studies revealed that activity of AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) were downregulated during autophagy. Furthermore, SPC failed to promote autophagy in p53 deleted cells. Thus SPC induced autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer cells was through AKT/mTORC1 and P53 signal pathway. Besides, SPC reduced both the mitochondria membrane potential and ROS level in A549 cells. These findings provided a molecular basis of SPC-stimulated A549 cell death and support the notion that inhibition of autophagy is likely a novel anticancer mechanism. ",

Conditioned media from cachexia-inducing cancer cells triggers metabolic dysfunction in skeletal muscle, including decreased mitochondrial respiration, which may contribute to fatigue.

We incubated C2C12 myotubes with LCM for 30 min, 2, 4, 24 or 48 h. We measured protein content by western blot; oxidant production by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF), 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF), and MitoSox; cytochrome c oxidase activity by oxidation of cytochrome c substrate; and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of intact myotubes by Seahorse XF Analyzer.;LCM treatment for 2 or 24 h decreased basal OCR and ATP-related OCR, but did not alter the content of mitochondrial complexes I, III, IV and V. LCM treatment caused a transient rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS). In particular, mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) was elevated at 2 h. 4-Hydroxynonenal, a marker of oxidative stress, was elevated in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of cell lysates after LCM treatment.;These data show that lung cancer-conditioned media alters electron flow in the ETC and increases mitochondrial ROS production, both of which may ultimately impair aerobic metabolism and decrease muscle endurance.",

However, whether inhibition of glycolysis will be effective in all types of cancer is unclear. The current study shows that a glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), exhibits the cytotoxic effect on non-small cell lung cancer in a p53-dependent manner. 2DG significantly inhibits ATP production in p53-deficient lung cancer cells (H358) but not in p53-wt cells (A549). In contrast to p53-wt cells, p53-defective cells are unable to compensate for their need of energy via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) when glycolysis is inhibited. In the presence of p53, increased ROS from OXPHOS increases the expression of p53 target genes known to modulate metabolism, including synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) and TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR). Importantly, 2DG selectively induces the expression of the antioxidant enzymes manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) in a p53-dependent manner. The results demonstrate that the killing of cancer cells by the inhibitor of glycolysis is more efficient in cancer cells without functional p53 and that p53 protects against metabolic stress by up-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and modulation of antioxidants.",

Cell killing by ionizing radiation is mediated primarily through the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-driven oxidative stress. Prx1, a peroxiredoxin family member, was shown to be frequently elevated in lung cancer cells and tissues. Although the antioxidant function of Prx1 is expected to affect the radiotherapy response of lung cancer, the physiologic significance of its peroxidase activity in irradiated cells is unclear because the catalytic Cys52 is easily inactivated by ROS due to its overoxidation to sulfinic or sulfonic acid. In this study, we investigated the role of Prx1 in radiation sensitivity of human lung cancer cells, with special emphasis on the redox status of the catalytic Cys52. We found that overexpression of Prx1 enhances the clonogenic survival of irradiated cells and suppresses ionizing radiation-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and apoptosis. The peroxidase activity of Prx1, however, is not essential for inhibiting JNK activation. The latter effect is mediated through its association with the glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi)-JNK complex, thereby preventing JNK release from the complex. Reduced JNK activation is observed when the peroxidase activity of Prx1 is compromised by Cys52 overoxidation or in the presence of the Cys52 to Ser52 mutant (Prx1C52S) lacking peroxidase activity. We show that both Prx1 and Prx1C52S interact with the GSTpi-JNK complex and suppress the release of JNK from the complex. Our study provides new insight into the antiapoptotic function of Prx1 in modulating radiosensitivity and provides the impetus to monitor the influence of Prx1 levels in the management of lung cancer.",

To date, it's still unclear that whether autophagy can be induced by LDH-A inhibition. Here, we investigated the effects of oxamate, one classic inhibitor of LDH-A in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as well as normal lung epithelial cells. The results showed that oxamate significantly suppressed the proliferation of NSCLC cells, while it exerted a much lower toxicity in normal cells. As previous studies reported, LDH-A inhibition resulted in ATP reduction and ROS (reactive oxygen species) burst in cancer cells, which lead to apoptosis and G2/M arrest in H1395 cells. However, when being exposed to oxamate, A549 cells underwent autophagy as a protective mechanism against apoptosis. Furthermore, we found evidence that LDH-A inhibition induced G0/G1 arrest dependent on the activation of GSK-3β in A549 cells. Taken together, our results provide useful clues for targeting LDH-A in NSCLC treatment and shed light on the discovery of molecular predictors for the sensitivity of LDH-A inhibitors. ",

A549 cells are less susceptible to cisplatin cytotoxicity than other lung cancer cell lines, concomitant with increases in HO-1 expression and MAPK phosphorylation in a time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, inhibition of HO-1 by siRNA and a specific HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP augments cisplatin cytotoxicity toward A549 cells. Pharmacologic suppression of HO-1 activity resulted in a marked increase in the ROS generation in cisplatin-treated cells.

We observed that although chronic gefitinib treatment provided effective action against its primary target (aberrant EGFR activity), secondary effects resulted in increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Gefitinib-mediated ROS correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as striking perturbation of mitochondrial morphology and function. However, gefitinib treatment in the presence of ROS scavenger provided a partial rescue of mitochondrial aberrations. Furthermore, withdrawal of gefitinib from previously resistant clones correlated with normalized expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes.

Here we investigated the contribution of the PI3-kinase/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways to survival of NSCLC cells. The two signaling pathways were studied by using different combinations of the PI3-kinase inhibitors LY-294002 and wortmannin, the Akt activator Ro 31-8220, the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 and PKC 412. PI3-kinase inhibitors induced apoptosis-like death in U1810 cells. H157 cells in general were relatively resistant to PI3 kinase/Akt inhibitors yet these compounds sensitized cells to the DNA-damaging drug VP-16, while Ro 31-8220 could not. PD 98059 only had a sensitizing effect on H157 cells when combined with PI3-kinase inhibition and VP-16. Morphological data indicated that LY-294002 and PKC 412 induced cell death at anaphase and metaphase, respectively, suggesting death by mitotic catastrophe. Analyzes of cells blocked in G2/M-phase by nocodazol revealed that LY-294002 increased, while PKC 412 decreased histone H3 phosphorylation, suggesting that LY-294002 allowed, while PKC 412 inhibited cells to leave M-phase. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution demonstrated that LY-294002 allowed cells to leave G2/M phase, while PKC 412 inhibited cytokinesis, resulting in formation of multinucleated cells.

In vitro, an mtDNA deletion A549 ρ(0) cell model was utilized to assess the function of mtDNA on radiosensitivity. Cell cycle distribution and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed to elucidate the potential mechanisms. For the whole group, the median follow-up time and overall survival time were 22.5 and 23.4 months, respectively. Patients with high mtDNA content had a marginally longer survival time than patients with low mtDNA content (P=0.053). Moreover, patients with high mtDNA content plus 10398G had a significantly longer overall survival time compared with those having low mtDNA content plus 10398A (47 vs. 27 months, P<0.05). In addition, multivariate analysis showed that stage and low mtDNA content plus 10398A were the two most independent prognostic factors. In vitro, the A549 ρ(0) cells showed more resistance to radiation than ρ(+) cells. Following radiation, ρ(0) cells showed delayed G2 arrest and lower ROS level as compared to ρ(+) cells. In conclusion, the present study suggests that in patients with NSCLC, low mtDNA content plus 10398A could be a marker of poor prognosis which is associated with resistance to anticancer treatment caused by low mtDNA content plus 10398A polymorphism resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Pretreatment of AS2 and H157 cells with rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), or carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler, suppressed the paclitaxel-induced activation of Stat3. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2), located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, can reduce ROS production in conditions of oxidative stress. UCP-2 protein expression in the four cancer cell lines was higher than that in normal lung epithelial cells (NL-20), but its expression was lower in AS2 and H157 cells relative to A549 and H460 cells. Silencing high UCP-2 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in A549 and H460 cells restored paclitaxel-induced Stat3 activation. In addition, paclitaxel-induced Stat3 activation led to the upregulation of survivin and Mcl-1, which in turn facilitated cell survival. Moreover, the CL1-5 subline had lower UCP-2 expression relative to the parental CL1-0 cells. Treatment with paclitaxel activated Stat3 in CL1-5 but not in CL1-0 cells, whereas in CL1-5 cells, the overexpression of UCP-2 with complementary DNA (cDNA) blocked Stat3 activation. In lung cancer patients, low UCP-2 expression in cancer cells was a predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy. Therefore, UCP-2 modulates the ROS/Stat3 signaling pathway and response to chemotherapy treatment in lung cancer cells. Targeting UCP-2, ROS and Stat3 pathways may improve anticancer therapies.",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung [HGNECs, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)].;Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

Diazeniumdiolate-based nitric oxide (NO)-releasing prodrugs are a growing class of promising NO-based therapeutics. Here, we show that O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (JS-K) is a potent cytotoxic agent against a subset of human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines both in vitro and as xenografts in mice. JS-K treatment led to 75% reduction in the growth of H1703 lung adenocarcinoma cells in vivo. Differences in sensitivity to JS-K in different lung cancer cell lines seem to be related to their endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Other related factors, levels of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRX1) and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine glycosylase (OGG1), also correlated with drug sensitivity. Treatment of the lung adenocarcinoma cells with JS-K resulted in oxidative/nitrosative stress in cells with high basal levels of ROS/RNS, which, combined with the arylating properties of the compound, was reflected in glutathione depletion and alteration in cellular redox potential, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, and cytochrome c release. Inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase by nitration was associated with increased superoxide and significant DNA damage. Apoptosis followed these events. Taken together, the data suggest that diazeniumdiolate-based NO-releasing prodrugs may have application as a personalized therapy for lung cancers characterized by high levels of ROS/RNS. PRX1 and OGG1 proteins, which can be easily measured, could function as biomarkers for identifying tumors sensitive to the therapy.",

Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Cell necrosis was evaluated with LDH assay. The expression of apoptosis- or autophagy-associated proteins was measured using Western blotting. The formation of acidic compartments was detected using AO staining, neutral red staining and Lysotracker-Red staining. LC3 punctae were analyzed with fluorescence microscopy.;Treatment with 3,4,4'-THS (10-80 μmol/L) concentration-dependently inhibited the cell viability. It did not cause cell necrosis, but induced apoptosis accompanied by up-regulation of cleavaged PARP, caspase3/9 and Bax, and by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and surviving. It also increased the formation of acidic compartments, LC3-II accumulation and GFP-LC3 labeled autophagosomes in the cells. It inhibited the mTOR-dependent pathway, but did not impair autophagic flux. 3,4,4'-THS-induced cell death was enhanced by the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA (5 mmol/L) or Wortmannin (2 μmol/L). Moreover, 3,4,4'-THS treatment elevated the ROS levels in the cells, and co-treatment with 3-MA further elevated the ROS levels. 3,4,4'-THS-induced apoptosis and autophagy in the cells was attenuated by NAC (10 mmol/L)Conclusion:3,4,4'-THS induces both apoptosis and autophagy in NSCLC A549 cells in vitro.

Almost half of the acquired resistance patients are due to additional T790M mutation on EGFR (EGFR(T790M)), thus overcoming TKI resistance is important. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TKI resistance as well as the molecular and biological effects of EGFR(T790M) after redox manipulation.;The basal ROS levels in EGFR(T790M)-containing TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines were substantially high. Sixty-three human lung tumors showed higher NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (NOX2) expression than normal lung tissues, which may contribute to high basal ROS in cancer and poor survival. Interestingly, only NOX3 was upregulated by sanguinarine, a pharmacological agent to elevate ROS, and resulted in EGFR overoxidation, degradation, and apoptosis. By contrast, such responses were lacking in EGFR(WT) cells. Selective EGFR(T790M) degradation was manipulated by redox imbalance between NOX3 and methionine reductase A (MsrA). Furthermore, the in vivo tumor suppression effect of sanguinarine, NOX3 upregulation, and EGFR degradation were confirmed.;We have found a new treatment strategy to overcome TKI resistance by selectively inducing EGFR(T790M) degradation via specific stimulation of methionine 790 (M790) oxidation. It can be achieved via manipulating redox imbalance between NOX3 and MsrA.;Targeting EGFR by elevating ROS and redox imbalance is a potential new strategy to develop a new EGFR inhibitor for TKI-resistant patients with a wide therapeutic window between EGFR(T790M) and EGFR(WT).",

The mechanism of drug resistance to cisplatin is complex and historically has been difficult to overcome. We report here that cisplatin resistant lung cancer cell lines possess high basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when compared to normal cells and their parental cell counterparts. These resistant cells also have low thioredoxin (TRX) levels which may be one of the contributory factors to high ROS. N'(1),N'(3)-dimethyl-N'(1),N'(3)-bis(phenylcarbonothioyl) propanedihydrazide (elesclomol), an agent known to increase ROS is selectively toxic to cisplatin-resistant cells, while sparing normal cells and the parental counterpart. The cytotoxic effect of elesclomol in resistant cells is accompanied by further decreases in TRX and glutathione (GSH) antioxidant systems, while opposite results were found in parental cells. The ID(50) of elesclomol in cisplatin-resistant cells ranged from 5-10 nM, which is well within clinically achievable ranges. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), which is known to neutralize ROS, can abolish the cytotoxic effect of elesclomol, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect results from increased ROS. Overall, our data suggest that elesclomol selectively kills cisplatin-resistant tumor cells through increased ROS. This agent may hold potential to overcome cisplatin resistance and should be further explored to treat patients who have failed cisplatin therapy.",

In addition, synergism was abrogated in the presence of an anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and was therefore shown to be reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent. It was further demonstrated using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay that treatment with CNs was associated with enhanced mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) activation that was ROS mediated.

One protein was purified to homogeneity with subsequent reversed-phase chromatography and identified by protein microsequencing as histone H2B.

SBHA inhibited the growth of A549 cells with an IC(50) of approximately 50 μM at 72 h in a dose-dependent manner. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that SBHA induced a G2/M phase arrest of the cell cycle. This agent also induced apoptosis, as evidenced by sub-G1 cells and annexin V-FITC staining cells. SBHA-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; ΔΨ(m)), Bcl-2 decrease, Bax increase, and the activation of caspase-3.

Moreover, DSS inhibited A549 cells proliferation in both dose- and time- dependent manner. Further study on molecular mechanism indicated that DSS suppressed redox regulator Nrf2, and down-regulated the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2.

Gene expressions were detected using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Mitochondrial mass, membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by staining with Mitotracker green, JC-1 and CM-H(2)DCFDA dyes respectively. Rate of progression through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was analysed by measuring activities of citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase. Cell cycle analysis was performed by using flow cytometry.;We found that XCT-790 treatment reduced mitochondrial mass but enhanced mitochondrial ROS production by increasing rate through the TCA cycle, elevating mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and down-regulating expression of superoxide dismutase. It was further demonstrated that XCT-790-induced ROS modulated p53 and Rb signalling pathways and suppressed cell replication.;ERRalpha affects cell cycle mechanisms through modulating mitochondrial mass and function.

Due to its unique structure providing enormous surface area to outside ambient air, it is vulnerable to numerous pathogens, pollutants, oxidants, gases, and toxicants that are inhaled continuously from air, which makes the lung susceptible to varying degrees of oxidative injury. To combat these unrelenting physical, chemical, and biological insults, the respiratory epithelium is covered with a thin layer of lining fluid containing several antioxidants and surfactants. Inhaled toxic agents stimulate the generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), which in turn provoke inflammatory responses resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These subsequently stimulate the influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes into the lung so as to combat the invading pathogens or toxic agents. In addition to the beneficial effects, persistent inhalation of the invading pathogens or toxic agents may result in overwhelming production of ROS/RNS, producing chronic inflammation and lung injury. During inflammation, enhanced ROS/RNS production may induce recurring DNA damage, inhibition of apoptosis, and activation of proto-oncogenes by initiating signal transduction pathways. Therefore, it is conceivable that chronic inflammation-induced production of ROS/RNS in the lung may predispose individuals to lung cancer. This review describes the complex relationship between lung inflammation and carcinogenesis, and highlights the role of ROS/RNS in cancer development.",

Considering that PM is highly heterogeneous, the potential health risks of PM promoting tumor metastasis in lung cancer, as well as its chemical characteristics, remain elusive. In the present study, we collected PM2.5 and PM10 in a peri-urban residential site of Taiyuan and determined the concentration and source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results indicated that 18 PAHs, ranging from 38.21 to 269.69 ng/m(3) (for PM2.5) and from 44.34 to 340.78 ng/m(3) (for PM10), exhibited seasonal variations, and the PAHs in winter PM mainly originated from coal combustion. We calculated the benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent (BaPeq) and found that the PAH-bound PM in winter exhibited higher carcinogenic risks for humans. Following this result, in vitro bioassays demonstrated that PM2.5 and PM10 induced A549 cell migration and invasion, and the mechanism involved reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation.

However, the precise mechanism of its action remains ambiguous. In this study, we elucidated the molecular basis for TL-induced cell death in context to p53 status. Cell death was attributed to dysfunction of mitochondrial bioenergetics in p53-deficient cells, which was characterized by decreased mitochondrial respiration, steady-state ATP level and membrane potential, but augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS production resulted in oxidative stress in TL-treated cells. This was exhibited by elevated nuclear levels of a redox-sensitive transcriptional factor, NF-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2), along with diminished cellular glutathione (GSH) content. We further demonstrated that in the absence of p53, TL blunted the expression of mitochondrial SIRT3 triggering increased acetylation of NDUAF9 and succinate dehydrogenase, components of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain (ETC). TL-mediated hyperacetylation of complexes I and II proteins and these complexes displayed decreased enzymatic activities. We also provide the evidence that P53 regulate steady-state level of SIRT3 through Proteasome-Pathway. Finally, forced overexpression of Sirt3, but not deacetylase-deficient mutant of Sirt3 (H243Y), restored the deleterious effect of TL on p53-deficient cells by rescuing mitochondrial bioenergetics. On contrary, Sirt3 deficiency in the background of wild-type p53 triggered TL-induced mitochondrial impairment that echoed TL effect in p53-deficeint cells. These findings illustrate a novel mechanism by which TL exerts its potent effects on mitochondrial function and ultimately the viability of NSCLC tumor. ",

We have shown that cisplatin-resistant tumors have higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and can be exploited for targeted therapy. Here, we show that increased secretion of the antioxidant thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) resulted in lowered intracellular TRX1 and contributed to higher ROS in cisplatin-resistant tumors in vivo and in vitro. By reconstituting TRX1 protein in cisplatin-resistant cells, we increased sensitivity to cisplatin but decreased sensitivity to elesclomol (ROS inducer). Conversely, decreased TRX1 protein in parental cells reduced the sensitivity to cisplatin but increased sensitivity to elesclomol. Cisplatin-resistant cells had increased endogenous oxygen consumption and mitochondrial activity but decreased lactic acid production. They also exhibited higher levels of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and fumarase mRNA, which contributed to oxidative metabolism (OXMET) when compared with parental cells. Restoring intracellular TRX1 protein in cisplatin-resistant cells resulted in lowering ASS and fumarase mRNAs, which in turn sensitized them to arginine deprivation. Interestingly, cisplatin-resistant cells also had significantly higher basal levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Overexpressing TRX1 lowered ACC and FAS proteins expressions in cisplatin-resistant cells. Chemical inhibition and short interfering RNA of ACC resulted in significant cell death in cisplatin-resistant compared with parental cells. Conversely, TRX1 overexpressed cisplatin-resistant cells resisted 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA)-induced death. Collectively, lowering TRX1 expression through increased secretion leads cisplatin-resistant cells to higher ROS production and increased dependency on OXMET. These changes raise an intriguing therapeutic potential for future therapy in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer.",

It is believed that curcumin is an effective drug possessing anti-invasive and anti-metastatic activities in the treatment of cancer. However, the specific mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether the PKCα/Nox-2/ATF-2/MMP-9 signaling pathway is involved in the invasive behavior of lung cancer and whether curcumin could inhibit invasion by modulating this pathway. The cytotoxic effect of curcumin was evaluated by MTT assay and the capacity of invasion was assessed by Transwell assay. siRNA and plasmid transfection techniques were used to study the function of targeted genes. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the expression levels of PKCα, Nox-2, MMP-9 and the phosphorylation of ATF-2. The results showed that curcumin inhibited the proliferation and invasion of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of MMP-9 enhanced the invasion of A549 cells. However, inhibition of MMP-9 by siRNA or curcumin suppressed cell invasion. Moreover, we also demonstrated the catalytic role of PKCα in expression of MMP-9 and cellular invasion in A549 cells, which was dependent on the expression of Nox-2 and phosphorylation of ATF-2. Finally, we also showed that curcumin dose-dependently reduced the expression of PKCα, P47phox, Nox-2 and phosphorylated ATF-2, as well as intracellular ROS generation, suggesting the inhibitory effect of curcumin on the activation of the PKCα/Nox-2/ROS/ATF-2 pathway. In conclusion, the PKCα/Nox-2/ROS/ATF-2/MMP-9 signaling pathway is activated in lung cancer A549 cells, which could be modulated by curcumin to inhibit cell invasiveness. ",

However, the molecular mechanisms behind this malignancy have yet to be established. In the present study, we examined the effects of Tan-IIA on human small cell lung cancer H146 cells in vitro. The cytotoxicity of Tan-IIA in H146 cells was measured using the MTT assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ in H146 cells were detected by flow cytometry, and the protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, NF-κBp65, GADD153 and β-actin in H146 cells was measured by Western blotting. H146 cells were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The protein expression of GADD153 and Caspase-3 was increased, but the proto-oncogene bcl-2 was notably decreased in H146 cells treated with Tan-IIA (5 µg/ml) for 24 h. FACS showed that Tan-IIA may increase the production of ROS and Ca2+, but decreases MMP. The results indicate that Tan-IIA is capable of inhibiting the proliferation of H146 cells. One of the molecular mechanisms behind this effect may be the induction of ROS release and the decrease in MMP caused by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Another may involve endoplasmic reticulum stress caused by the release of Ca2+ and an increase in GADD153 expression followed by a decrease in Bcl-2 expression, which induces a higher ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, in turn causing a decrease in MMP and leading to an increase in Caspase-3 expression and the inhibition of H146 cells. Thus, Tan-IIA may be a promising novel chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of human small cell lung cancer H146 cells.",

ROS generated due to oxidative stress can potentiate both cancer initiation and progression. Rotenone, which is an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, results in the activation of NOX2 and release of ROS, and has been shown to display anticancer activity through the induction of apoptosis in various cancer cells. The mechanistic link between rotenone-dependent activation of NOX2 and induction of apoptosis is still elusive. In this study, we used the human lung cancer A549 cells to study the molecular mechanism(s) involved between rotenone-dependent activation of NOX2 and impairment of autophagic machinery. We report that acute exposure to rotenone induced mild NOX2-dependnet oxidative stress, which impaired the autophagic flux, resulting in cytosolic accumulation of LC3 and p62/STSQM1. We further show that this induction occurs through the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. We furthermore show that chronic exposure to rotenone lead to excessive NOX2-dependent ROS generation, increases autophagy, and decreases p62 level via increased-autophagic flux. Taken together, this study is the first mechanistic elucidation of how rotenone can be used to potently target cancer cells without overhauling the entire cellular machinery. © 2016 IUBMB Life 68(5):388-393, 2016.

In this study, we studied the signaling processes associated between tobacco exposure and lung cancer. First, we detected and validated pathway-specific gene expression at bronchial epithelium. These proteins reflected the activation of signaling pathways relevant to tobacco exposure, including ATM, BCL2, GPX1, K-Ras, IKBKB, and SIRT1. Tobacco smoking was simulated via reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway. ROS not only arrested cell cycle at G1/S stage but also increased expressions of Sirt1 and p27. Further studies showed that the expression of p27 was dependent on ERK1/2 activation, and p27 itself could halt cell cycle by inhibiting the activation of CDKs. Moreover, activation of K-Ras, the key regulator of Ras/ERK pathway, was tightly regulated by enzyme activity of Sirt1. Deacetylation of K-Ras by Sirt1 increased the transformation of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, promoting the activation of downstream of ERK1/2. In reverse, Ras/ERK pathway could also regulate Sirt1 transcription. In conclusion, inhibition of Sirt1 may be an effective strategy for the prevention of tumor progression in high-risk patients or as a therapeutic strategy in established tumors.",

Cabozantinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targets MET, VEGFR, RET, ROS1, and AXL, which are implicated in lung cancer tumorigenesis. We compared the efficacy of cabozantinib alone or in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC.;This three group, randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial was done in 37 academic and community oncology practices in the USA. Patients were eligible if they had received one or two previous treatments for advanced non-squamous, EGFR wild-type, NSCLC. Patients were stratified by performance status and line of therapy, and randomly assigned using permuted blocks within strata to receive open-label oral daily dosing of erlotinib (150 mg), cabozantinib (60 mg), or erlotinib (150 mg) and cabozantinib (40 mg). Imaging was done every 8 weeks. At the time of radiographic progression, there was optional crossover for patients in either single-drug group to receive combination treatment. The primary endpoint was to compare progression-free survival in patients given erlotinib alone versus cabozantinib alone, and in patients given erlotinib alone versus the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib. We assessed the primary endpoint in the per-protocol population, which was defined as all patients who were eligible, randomly assigned, and received at least one dose of treatment. The safety analysis population included all patients who received study treatment irrespective of eligibility. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01708954.;Between Feb 7, 2013, and July 1, 2014, we enrolled and randomly assigned 42 patients to erlotinib treatment, 40 patients to cabozantinib treatment, and 43 patients to erlotinib plus cabozantinib treatment, of whom 111 (89%) in total were included in the primary analysis (erlotinib [n=38], cabozantinib [n=38], erlotinib plus cabozantinib [n=35]).

Treatment with MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells with an IC(50) of approximately 20 microM at 24 hours. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that 0.5 approximately 30 microM MG132 induced a G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle in A549 cells. Treatment with 10 or 30 microM MG132 also induced apoptosis, as evidenced by sub-G1 cells and annexin V staining cells. This was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; Delta psi m). The intracellular ROS levels including O(2) (*-) were strongly increased in 10 or 30 microM MG132-treated A549 cells but were down-regulated in 0.1, 0.5 or 1 microM MG132-treated cells.

The apoptotic process in AMA-treated Calu-6 cells was accompanied by the up-regulation of Bax, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), and the activation of caspase-3 and -8. All of the tested caspase inhibitors, especially pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD), markedly rescued Calu-6 cells from AMA-induced Calu-6 cell death. Inhibitors of pan-caspase and caspase-8 also prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). AMA decreased the intracellular ROS levels but increased the O(2)(*-) levels in Calu-6 cells. In conclusion, AMA as a mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor decreased the growth of lung cancer Calu-6 cell via inducing a G1 arrest of the cell cycle and apoptosis.",

Exposure of the cells to both paraquat and hydrogen peroxide resulted in significantly higher mutation frequencies compared with untreated control cells. Mutation frequencies up to 27-fold higher than the spontaneous mutation frequencies were obtained. The majority of the reversion mutants contained frameshift mutations within the target sequence.

EMT markers were examined by western blot analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by specific fluorescence dyes and flow cytometry. All results were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by individual comparisons with post hoc test.;The present study has revealed for the first time that the zinc could induce EMT and related metastatic behaviors in lung cancer cells. Results showed that treatment of the cells with zinc resulted in the significant increase of EMT markers N-cadherin, vimentin, snail and slug and decrease of E-cadherin proteins. Zinc-treated cells exhibited the mesenchymal-like morphology and increased cancer cell motility with significant increase of activated FAK, Rac1, and RhoA. Also, tumorigenic abilities of lung cancer cells could be enhanced by zinc. Importantly, the underlying mechanism was found to be caused by the ability of zinc to generate intracellular superoxide anion. Zinc was shown to induce cellular superoxide anion generation and the up-regulation of EMT markers and the induced cell migration and invasion in zinc-treated cells could be attenuated by the treatment of MnTBAP, a specific superoxide anion inhibitor.;Knowledge gains from this study may highlight the roles of this important element in the regulation of EMT and cancer metastasis and fulfill the understanding in the area of cancer cell biology.",

Presence of CD86-positive cells was required for the anti-tumoral effects of CO in established A549 xenografts. We show that the effects of CO on tumor stroma and reprogramming of macrophages towards the anti-tumoral phenotype is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of MAPK/Erk1/2-c-myc pathway as well as Notch 1-dependent negative feedback on the metabolic enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) are important in cancer progression and regulation of EMT. To explore the biological significance and regulatory mechanism of EMT, we determined the expression, the biological function and the signaling pathway of prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced-1 (TMEPAI), during the induction of EMT and cell migration. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 significantly upregulated the expression of TMEPAI during EMT in human lung adenocarcinoma. Depletion of TMEPAI abolished TGF-β1-induced downregulation of ferritin heavy chain and the subsequent generation of ROS, thus suppressing TGF-β1-induced EMT and cell migration. In addition, increased ROS production and overexpression of TMEPAI downregulated the level of IRS-1. Both the addition of H2O2 and IRS-1 small interfering RNA rescued the ability of TGF-β1 to induce EMT in TMEPAI-depleted cells. Remarkably, the levels of TMEPAI in lung tumor tissues are very high, whereas its expression in normal lung epithelium is very low. Moreover, TMEPAI expression was positively correlated with the cell mesenchymal phenotype and migration potential. Our work reveals that TMEPAI contributes to TGF-β1-induced EMT through ROS production and IRS-1 downregulation in lung cancer cells. ",

More recently, several oncogenes have been shown to activate Nrf2 signaling as the main prosurvival pathway mediating ROS detoxification, senescence evasion, and neoplastic transformation. Thus, it is important to determine if there is any risk of enhanced lung tumorigenesis associated with prolonged administration of SFN using mouse models of cancer.;We evaluated the effect of prolonged SFN treatment on oncogenic K-ras (K-ras(LSL-G12D))-driven lung tumorigenesis. One week post mutant-K-ras expression, mice were treated with SFN (0.5 mg, 5 d/wk) for 3 months by means of a nebulizer. Fourteen weeks after mutant K-ras expression (K-ras(LSL-G12D)), mice were sacrificed, and lung sections were screened for neoplastic foci. Expression of Nrf2-dependent genes was measured using real time RT-PCR. We also determined the effect of prolonged SFN treatment on the growth of preclinical xenograft models using human A549 (with mutant K-ras and Keap1 allele) and H1975 [with mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) allele] nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.;Systemic SFN administration did not promote the growth of K-ras(LSL-G12D)-induced lung tumors and had no significant effect on the growth of A549 and H1975 established tumor xenografts in nude mice.

Radiosensitizing activity was assessed in vitro by treating cells with luteolin prior to irradiation of γ‑ionizing radiation (IR), and performing cell count and clonogenic assays. Cell signaling pathways involved in the radiosensitizing effects of luteolin were examined using propidium iodide (PI) uptake, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and immunoblot assays, with or without specific chemical inhibitors. Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by PI uptake and immunoblot assays. In vivo radiosensitizing activity was tested using an NCI‑H460 cell xenograft model in nude mice. Tumor size was measured and apoptosis was determined with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in animals in four treatment groups: mock‑treated control, luteolin only, IR only, and luteolin plus IR. Treatment with luteolin or IR induced NSCLC cell death in vitro, but the combination of luteolin pre‑treatment and IR was more effective than either agent alone, yielding dose enhancement ratios (DERs) of 1.22 and 1.35 for NCI‑H460 and ‑H1299 cells, respectively. Combined treatment with luteolin and IR enhanced apoptotic cell death in association with downregulation of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and activation of caspase‑3, ‑8, and ‑9; it also induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ROS accumulation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK decreased ROS production, and inhibition of either p38 MAPK or ROS production attenuated apoptotic cell death and activation of caspase‑8 and ‑9. In a xenograft model, tumor growth was delayed by 21.8 days in the luteolin/IR combination group compared with controls, and apoptotic cell death was increased. The enhancement factor of the luteolin and IR combination was 1.83.

In this study, we investigated the effects of SBHA on the growth inhibition and death of Calu-6 and NCI-H1299 cells in relation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant levels. SBHA inhibited the growth of Calu-6 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells with an IC50 of 50 µM at 72 h. This agent induced apoptosis in Calu-6 cells and triggered to a G2/M phase arrest in NCI-H1299 cells. Although it also reduced the growth of normal human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells, the susceptibility of Calu-6 cells to SBHA was higher than that of HPF cells. In addition, SBHA did not affect the growth of human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC). Regarding ROS and antioxidant levels, SBHA increased ROS level and glutathione (GSH) depletion in Calu-6 and NCI-H1299 cells whereas it decreased ROS levels in HPF and HSAEC. SBHA also decreased thioredoxin1 (Trx1) level in Calu-6 cells. Although the down-regulation of Trx1 intensified apoptosis and ROS level in SBHA-treated Calu-6 cells, the overexpression of Trx1 attenuated apoptosis and ROS level in these cells. This down-regulation of Trx1 did not affect apoptosis-signaling regulating kinase1 (ASK1) activation. In conclusion, the down-regulation of Trx1 by SBHA was closely involved in cell death in Calu-6 cells.",

Their effects in the cell include oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, yet the molecular mechanisms leading to such effects remain unclear. We tested whether [Cu(4,7-dimethyl-phenanthroline)(glycinate)]NO(3) (Casiopeína IIgly or Cas IIgly) could alter cellular glutathione (GSH) levels by redox cycling with GSH to generate ROS and cellular oxidative stress. Cas IIgly induced a dramatic drop in intracellular levels of GSH in human lung cancer H157 and A549 cells, and is able to use GSH as source of electrons to catalyze the Fenton reaction. In both cell lines, the toxicity of Cas IIgly (2.5-5 microM) was potentiated by the GSH synthesis inhibitor l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and diminished by the catalytic antioxidant manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N,N'-diethylimidazolium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTDE-1,3-IP(5+)), thus supporting an important role for oxidative stress. Cas IIgly also caused an over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria and a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Moreover, Cas IIgly produced mitochondrial DNA damage that resulted in an imbalance of the expression of the apoproteins of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which also can contribute to increased ROS production. These results suggest that Cas IIgly initiates multiple possible sources of ROS over-production leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.",

The main biochemical and molecular alterations that are responsible for the syndrome are prematurely present in the progress of the disease and the identification of the early stages of cachexia can be useful in targetting patients who will benefit from early treatment. The aim of the present study was to delineate the bio-humoral profile of a group of lung cancer patients either non-cachectic or cachectic by evaluating serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress/antioxidant parameters (both recognized to be involved in cachexia pathogenesis) and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in PBMC (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells) of cancer patients. All serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress/antioxidant parameters significantly increased in neoplastic patients, but only TNF-alpha, ROS, GSH and vitamin E showed a significantly greater increase in cachectic patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression mirrored serum level behaviour except for IL-6 that was increased in serum but not as gene expression, suggesting its provenience from tumour tissue. Our data support that the simultaneous determination of ROS, GSH, vitamin E, together with TNF-alpha allows the identification of a lung cancer patient developing cancer-related cachexia. This bio-humoral profile should be used for the early diagnosis and follow-up of the syndrome. Moreover, the evaluation of gene expression in patient PBMC was helpful in differentiating tumour vs host factors, therefore being useful in the study of pathogenetic mechanisms in neoplastic cachectic patients.",

However, mechanisms of curcumin-inhibited cell growth and -induced apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cells (NCI-H460) still remain unclear. In this study, NCI-H460 cells were treated with curcumin to determine its anticancer activity. Different concentrations of curcumin were used for different durations in NCI-H460 cells and the subsequent changes in the cell morphology, viability, cell cycle, mRNA and protein expressions were determined. Curcumin induced apoptotic morphologic changes in NCI-H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After curcumin treatment, BAX and BAD were up-regulated, BCL-2, BCL-X(L) and XIAP were down-regulated. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular Ca(2+) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were increased in NCI-H460 cells after exposure to curcumin. These signals led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) and culminated in caspase-3 activation. Curcumin-induced apoptosis was also stimulated through the FAS/caspase-8 (extrinsic) pathway and ER stress proteins, growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were activated in the NCI-H460 cells. Apoptotic cell death induced by curcumin was significantly reversed by pretreatment with ROS scavenger or caspase-8 inhibitor. Furthermore, the NCI-H460 cells tended to be arrested at the G(2)/M cell cycle stage after curcumin treatment and down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) may be involved. In summary, curcumin exerts its anticancer effects on lung cancer NCI-H460 cells through apoptosis or cell cycle arrest.",

In comparison with human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, the natural PTEN loss in another human lung adenocarcinoma line, PC14PE6/AS2 cells, presents reduced responsiveness in IFN-γ-induced IFN regulatory factor 1 activation and CD54 expression. Artificially silencing PTEN expression in A549 cells also caused cells to be unresponsive to IFN-γ without affecting IFN-γ receptor expression.

Inhibiting ROS and SHP2 rescued cellular responses to IFN-γ-induced cytotoxicity and inhibition of cell proliferation in PC14PE6/AS2 cells.

The links between EMT and biological responses to cigarette smoke, such as hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative damages, are also discussed. The effect of cigarette smoke on EMT is not only limited to cancer types directly related to smoking, such as lung cancer, but has also been found in other types of cancer. Altogether, this review emphasizes the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms of the induction of EMT by cigarette smoking and will help in identifying novel small molecules for targeting EMT induced by smoking.

However, no effective strategies against VEGF expression have been available in NSCLCs therapy. This study demonstrated that elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels derived from both mitochondria and NADPH oxidase were required for VEGF expression in NSCLC cells. Atorvastatin administration could significantly inhibit VEGF expression both in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of ROS production. Atorvastatin inhibited ROS generation partly through suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity. Specifically, atorvastatin could upregulate the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase, which are responsible for elimination of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. Thus, inhibition of ROS production by concomitant suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity and upregulation of the activity of GPx and catalase contributes critically to atorvastatin-reduced VEGF expression in NSCLCs. Atorvastatin may be a potential alternative against VEGF expression and angiogenesis in NSCLCs therapy.",

The binding characteristics of LC antibodies with native and ROS-damaged HSA are assessed. Smoking and non-smoking LC patients (n=40) are examined by a direct binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the results are compared with healthy age- and gender-matched smoking and non-smoking subjects (n=38). A high degree of specific binding in approximately 70% of cancer immunoglobulin G (IgG) towards ROS-damaged HSA was observed, compared to results with its native analogue (P<0.05). Affinity purified IgG from those LC patients with a history of smoking showed substantially stronger binding to damaged HSA over native HSA. Competitive inhibition ELISA substantiated the enhanced recognition of ROS-HSA by circulating antibodies in LC patients. The increase in total serum protein carbonyl levels in the LC patients was largely due to an increase in oxidised albumin. Purified HSA from LC patients (LC-HSA) contained higher levels of carbonyls than did HSA from healthy subjects (normal-HSA; P<0.01). LC-HSA was conformationally altered and showed greater exposure of its hydrophobic regions.

        "Doc_abstract":"Oxidative damage is implicated in several chronic diseases including cancer. 8-Hydroxyguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the major promutagenic DNA lesions, which is produced by reactive oxygen species, causes G:C to T:A transversions and is excised by OGG1, an 8-oxoG specific DNA glycosylase/AP-Lyase. In a nested case-control study, gDNA from 105 Caucasian primary non-small cell lung cancer cases and 105 matched controls was screened for 6 possible new polymorphic sites in the human OGG1 gene, detected previously mainly in tumour tissue. The previously described Ser(326)Cys polymorphism was found to be common (allele frequency 0.22) in Caucasians. However, no major difference in Ser(326)Cys genotype distribution could be detected between cases and controls. Two 5;-end polymorphisms previously found in Japanese as well as Arg(131)Gln could not be detected in this population. An Ala(85)Ser polymorphism was found in 2 controls, whereas Arg(46)Gln was detected in only 1 case. As the hOGG1 gene is mapped (3p26.2) to a region frequently lost in primary lung tumours, the frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was investigated. Forty-three percent of the studied lung tumours exhibited loss of one of the hOGG1 alleles. The wt Ser(326) allele was not predominantly lost in our sample set, which suggests a minor role of this polymorphism in tumourgenesis. Our results show that LOH at the hOGG1 gene locus is a very common occurrence in lung tumourgenesis, possibly leading to increased mutational damage due to ROS in smokers. However, the hOGG1 polymorphisms studied are probably not major contributors to individual lung cancer susceptibility in Caucasians.",

In the current study, the anticancer properties of total tanshinones (TDT) were evaluated using 95D lung cancer cells. Tanshinone IIA was identified as the main component of TDT. Compared with tanshinone IIA, TDT showed more cytotoxic effects on the 95D cells. Annexin V/7-AAD double staining, the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (Δψ), the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as cleaved-PARP, cleaved-caspase-3, Bax, and Bad, and the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were evidence of TDT-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, TDT-induced autophagy as demonstrated by monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and the up-regulation of autophagy-associated proteins, such as LC3-II, Beclin-1, Atg3, Atg5, Atg7, and Atg12. Autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and bafilomycin A1, enhanced TDT-induced cell death. 3-MA pretreatment enhanced the TDT-induced up-regulation of Bax and cleaved-PARP. In addition, TDT induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was reversed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC also reversed TDT-induced depolarization of Δψ, MDC staining, up-regulation of Bax, cleaved-PARP, Beclin-1, LC3-II, and cell viability. In conclusion, our findings showed that TDT-induced apoptosis and protective autophagy in 95D cells mediated by increasing intracellular ROS production. ",

Additional oncogene aberrations, including RET, ROS1, and NRG1 fusions, skipping of exon 14 of MET, and mutations in BRAF, HER2, NF1, and MEK1, were recently added to the list of such \"druggable\" driver oncogene aberrations, and their responses to targeted therapies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.

In addition, a decrease in catalase activity or accumulation of hydrogen peroxide correlates with cancer metastasis. Recent studies indicate that cathepsin activation and expression can be modulated via H2O2 treatment. However, the actual relationship between catalase and cathepsins is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we found that catalase expression (or activity) was higher, while intracellular and extracellular Cat S, Cat L, and Cat K activities were lower in the non-invasive CL1-0 cells compared to the highly invasive CL1-5 cells. After CL1-0 cells were transfected with catalase-shRNA, the corresponding ROS (H2O2) level and Cat S, Cat L, or Cat K expression (or activity) was up-regulated, accompanied by an increase in cell migration and invasion. On the other hand, ROS (H2O2) level, cathepsin S, L, and K activities, cell migration and invasion were decreased in catalase-overexpressed CL1-5 cells. It is suggested that catalase may regulate cathepsin activity by controlling the production of ROS (H2O2), leading to variation in migration and invasion ability of lung cancer cells. ",

Here, we investigated the anti-cancer activities of OEL in human lung cancer cells. Our studies demonstrated that OEL induced both apoptosis and autophagy in A549 and H460 cells. OEL-induced autophagy was assessed by appearance of autophagic vacuoles, formation of acidic vesicular organelles, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, recruitment of LC3-II to the autophagosomes, and activation of autophagy genes. Furthermore, administration of autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine augments OEL-induced apoptotic cell death. The induction of autophagy and apoptosis by OEL links to NF-κB activation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interruption of NF-κB activation by specific inhibitor promotes apoptosis, but decreases autophagy. ROS antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine) attenuated both OEL-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Further experiments confirmed that OEL-induced activation of ROS was increased by NF-κB inhibitor whereas NF-κB activation was not affected by ROS inhibition. These findings suggest that OEL-elicited autophagic response plays a protective role that impedes cell death, and inhibition of autophagy could be an adjunctive strategy for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect of OEL as an antitumor agent.

In the present study, we intend to explore p53-mediated apoptosis pathway enhanced by ECHC in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. This report shows that ECHC increases ROS generation and sensitizes mitochondrial membrane that leads to the release of cytochrome C (Cyto C) into cytosol. Further, ECHC decreases the expression of antiapoptotic genes such as TNF-α, IL-8, Bcl2, MMP2, and MMP9 which are actively involved in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis etc. It also increases the expression of apoptotic genes Cyto C, Bax, and p21, which are responsible for cell cycle arrest and cell death. The tumor suppressor p53 was also observed to be upregulated during ECHC treatment in untransformed cells and was more likely to result in cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Finally, ECHC also down regulates the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 which are the death stage of intrinsic apoptosis. Our findings suggested that ECHC enhances ROS generation and mitochondrial sensitization determines the threshold for irreversible p53-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. ",

Herein, we have studied cytotoxic effect of CONP in several cancer and normal cell lines and their potential to change intracellular redox status. The IC50 was achieved only in two of eight tested cell lines, melanoma 518A2 and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29. Self-propagating room temperature method was applied to produce CONP with an average crystalline size of 4 nm. The results confirmed presence of Ce(3+) and O(2-) vacancies. The induction of cell death by CONP and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed by flow-cytometry. Free radicals related antioxidant capacity of the cells was studied by the reduction of stable free radical TEMPONE using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. CONP showed low or moderate cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines: adenocarcinoma DLD1 and multi-drug resistant DLD1-TxR, non-small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H460 and multi-drug resistant NCI-H460/R, while normal cell lines (keratinocytes HaCaT, lung fetal fibroblasts MRC-5) were insensitive. The most sensitive were 518A2 melanoma and HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, with the IC50 values being between 100 and 200 μM. Decreased rate of TEMPONE reduction and increased production of certain ROS species (peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide anion) indicates that free radical metabolism, thus redox status was changed, and antioxidant capacity damaged in the CONP treated 518A2 and HT-29 cells. In conclusion, changes in intracellular redox status induced by CONP are partly attributed to the prooxidant activity of the nanoparticles. Further, ROS induced cell damages might eventually lead to the cell death. However, low inhibitory potential of CONP in the other human cell lines tested indicates that CONP may be safe for human usage in industry and medicine.",

However, the mechanisms by which redox-regulated tumor progression are largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that reduced intracellular redox conditions could be achieved in stably transfected small cell lung cancer cells with gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCSh) cDNA which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH), a major physiological redox regulator. In the present study, using DNA microarray analyses, we compared the expression profiles between the gamma-GCSh-transfected cells and their nontransfected counterpart. We observed downregulation of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), i.e., MMPI and MMP3, and MMP10 in the transfected cells. Dot blot and Northern blot hybridizations confirmed that, among the 18 MMP gene family members and four tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloprotein family (TIMP) analyzed, the expression levels of these three MMPs were consistently reduced. Transiently increased gamma-GCSh expression using tetracycline-inducible gamma-GCSh adenoviral expression system also showed down-regulation of MMP3 and MMP10, but not MMP1. Our results demonstrated that redox regulation of MMP1, MMP3 and MMP10 expression depend upon different modes of redox manipulation. These results bear implication that antioxidant modulation of antitumor progression may be contributed at least in part by the downregulation of a subset of metrix metalloproteins.",

Particulate matter (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are two major pollutants derived from coal combustion processes and co-existing in coal-smoke air pollution, but their potentially synergistic toxicity remains elusive thus far. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic responses of PM10 and SO2, singly and in binary mixtures, using human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells, followed by clarifying the possible mechanisms for their interaction. The results indicated that the concomitant treatment of PM10 and SO2 at low concentrations led to synergistic injury in terms of cell survival and apoptosis occurrence, while PM10 and SO2 alone at the same concentrations did not cause damage to the cells. Also, radical oxygen species (ROS) production followed by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation was involved in the above synergistic cytotoxicity, which was confirmed by the repression of the actions by an ROS inhibitor (NAC). This implies that assessment of health risk should consider the interactions between ambient PM and gaseous copollutants. ",

Ginsenoside Rg3 is the main pharmacologically active component in ginseng and has been reported to have an antioxidant effect. To overcome lung cancer by regulating the ROS level, we investigated the antitumor effect and mechanism of Rg3 and its antioxidative property on Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells.;Inhibition of ROS was suppressed in LLC cells by Rg3 treatment, and these cells were used to investigate the antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antitumor effects in LLC cells.;ROS production was increased in cells grown in serum-containing media (conditioned media) compared to those grown in serum-free media. The high level of ROS induced LLC cell proliferation, but treatment with Rg3 (200 ng/ml) resulted in reduction of ROS, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation. Treatment with Rg3 significantly reduced cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase expression in LLC cells. Additionally, Rg3 treatment significantly suppressed activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and induced LLC cell apoptosis through activation of pro-apoptotic proteins and suppression of anti-apoptotic proteins.;Taken together, these findings demonstrate the role of Rg3 in reduction of the intracellular ROS level, attenuation of proliferation via augmentation of cell cycle- and cell proliferation-associated proteins, and activation of apoptosis through regulation of apoptosis-associated proteins in LLC.

Little or no change in the ADM sensitivity of parent cells is brought about by concentrations of VRP up to 15-20 microM. In the resistant line, a dose-related effect of VRP is seen with little effect below 1.0 microM and a gradual loss of resistance at higher doses.

Patients were then asked to indicate their preferred Fx schedules, reasons and their level of satisfaction with being involved in the decision-making process. Radiation oncologists (RO) could prescribe radiotherapy schedules irrespective of patients' preferences. Of 92 patients enrolled, 55% chose the longer schedule. English-speaking patients were significantly more likely to choose the longer schedule (P = 0.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-7.6). Longer Fx was chosen because of longer survival (90%) and better local control (12%). Shorter Fx was chosen for shorter overall treatment duration (80%), cost (61%) and better symptom control (20%). In all, 56% of patients choosing the shorter schedule had their treatment altered by the treating RO, whereas only 4% of patients choosing longer Fx had their treatment altered (P < 0.001). Despite this, all (100%) patients were satisfied with being involved in the decision-making process. The decision board was useful in aiding decision-making, with both Fx schedules being acceptable to patients. Interestingly, despite the longer average survival associated with longer Fx, nearly half of the patients believed that this was not as important as a shorter duration of treatment and lower cost.

In this study, 10 RTs, 1 RO, and 1 RD performed a manual tumor alignment and correction of the planning GTV to a treatment CBCT to generate an isocenter correction distance for 15 patient data sets. Participants also contoured the GTV on the same data sets. The isocenter correction distance and the contoured GTVs from the RTs were compared with the RD and RO. The mean difference in isocenter correction distances was 0.40cm between the RO and RD, 0.51cm between the RTs, and RO and 0.42cm between the RTs and RD. The 95% CIs were smaller than the equivalence limit of 0.5cm, indicating that the RTs were equivalent to the RO and RD. For GTV delineation comparisons, the RTs were not found to be equivalent to the RD or RO. The alignment of the planning defined GTV and treatment CBCT using soft tissue matching by the RTs has been shown to be equivalent to those by the RO and RD. However, tumor delineation by the RTs on the treatment CBCT was not equivalent to that of the RO and RD. Thus, it may be appropriate for RTs to undertake soft tissue alignment based on CBCT; however, further investigation may be necessary before RTs undertake delineation for adaptive radiotherapy purposes.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity governs multi-drug resistance (MDR) development in different cancer cell types. Identification of anti-cancer agents with the potential to kill cancer cells and at the same time inhibit MDR is important to intensify the search for novel therapeutic approaches. We examined the effects of sulfinosine (SF), a quite unexplored purine nucleoside analog, in MDR (P-gp over-expressing) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and glioblastoma cell lines (NCI-H460/R and U87-TxR, respectively). SF showed the same efficacy against MDR cancer cell lines and their sensitive counterparts. However, it was non-toxic for normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT). SF induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death and autophagy in MDR cancer cells. After SF application, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated and glutathione (GSH) concentration was decreased. The expression of key enzyme for GSH synthesis, gamma Glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (γGCS) was decreased as well as the expression of gst-π mRNA. Consequently, SF significantly decreased the expression of hif-1α, mdr1 and vegf mRNAs even in hypoxic conditions. SF caused the inhibition of P-gp (coded by mdr1) expression and activity. The accumulation of standard chemotherapeutic agent--doxorubicin (DOX) was induced by SF in concentration- and time-dependent manner. The best effect of SF was obtained after 72 h when it attained the effect of known P-gp inhibitors (Dex-verapamil and tariquidar). Accordingly, SF sensitized the resistant cancer cells to DOX in subsequent treatment. Furthermore, SF decreased the experssion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on mRNA and protein level and modulated its secretion. In conclusion, the effects on P-gp (implicated in pharmacokinetics and MDR), GSH (implicated in detoxification) and VEGF (implicated in tumor-angiogenesis and progression) qualify SF as multi-potent anti-cancer agent, which use must be considered, in particular for resistant malignancies.",

In genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for Kras-driven lung cancer, autophagy prevents the accumulation of defective mitochondria and promotes malignancy. Autophagy-deficient tumor-derived cell lines are respiration-impaired and starvation-sensitive. However, to what extent their sensitivity to starvation arises from defective mitochondria or an impaired supply of metabolic substrates remains unclear. Here, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of wild-type or autophagy-deficient (Atg7(-/-)) Kras-driven lung tumors. Although Atg7 deletion resulted in increased mitochondrial mutations, there were too few nonsynonymous mutations to cause generalized mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, pulse-chase studies with isotope-labeled nutrients revealed impaired mitochondrial substrate supply during starvation of the autophagy-deficient cells. This was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower energy charge, and a dramatic drop in total nucleotide pools. While starvation survival of the autophagy-deficient cells was not rescued by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, it was fully rescued by glutamine or glutamate (both amino acids that feed the TCA cycle and nucleotide synthesis) or nucleosides. Thus, maintenance of nucleotide pools is a critical challenge for starving Kras-driven tumor cells. By providing bioenergetic and biosynthetic substrates, autophagy supports nucleotide pools and thereby starvation survival. ",

This study investigated the regulatory mechanism underlying adaphostin induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) which plays a significant role in modulation of drug-induced toxicity in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line model, NCI-H522.;The transcriptional response of NCI-H522 to adaphostin prominently involved oxidative stress genes, particularly HMOX1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement was additionally established by generation of ROS prior to modulation of adaphostin-toxicity with antioxidants. To identify up-stream regulatory elements of HMOX1, immunofluorescence was used to evaluate nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), in the presence of adaphostin. The PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, was employed as a pharmacological inhibitor of this process.;Generation of ROS provided a substantial foundation for the sensitivity of NCI-H522 to adaphostin. However, in contrast to leukemia cell lines, transcriptional response to oxidative stress was associated with induction of HMOX1, which was dependent on nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, Nrf2. Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin inhibited translocation of Nrf2 and induction of HMOX1. Wortmannin pretreatment was also able to diminish adaphostin induction of HMOX1, and as a consequence, enhance the toxicity of adaphostin to NCI-H522.;Adaphostin-induced oxidative stress in NCI-H522 was mediated through nuclear translocation of Nrf2 leading to upregulation of HMOX1. Inhibition of Nrf2 translocation by wortmannin inhibited this cytoprotective response, and enhanced the toxicity of adaphostin, suggesting that inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, such as wortmannin, might augment the antiproliferative effects of adaphostin in solid tumors that depend on the Nrf2/ARE pathway for protection against oxidative stress.",

The presence of two quinone moieties in its structure was demonstrated to induce accidental necrosis and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Therefore, one quinone of 1 was modified to produce the 5-O-acetylated hydroquinone derivative (2), and 2 dramatically reduced the accidental necrosis inducing effect while preserving the apoptosis-inducing effect of parent 1 on lung cancer H23 cells. Addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine suppressed the accidental necrosis mediated by 1, suggesting that its accidental necrosis inducing effect was ROS-dependent. The fluorescent probe dihydroethidium revealed that the accidental necrosis mediated by 1 was due to its ability to generate intracellular superoxide anions. Interestingly, the remaining quinone in 2 was required for its cytotoxicity, as the 5,8,15,18-O-tetraacetylated bishydroquinone derivative (3) exhibited weak cytotoxicity compared to 1 and 2.

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a key protein involved in tumor metastasis, but its role in anoikis and its regulation during cell detachment are unclear. We report here that Cav-1 plays a key role as a negative regulator of anoikis through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism in human lung carcinoma H460 cells. During cell detachment, Cav-1 is downregulated, whereas ROS generation is upregulated. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical are two key ROS produced by cells during detachment. Treatment of the cells with hydrogen peroxide scavengers, catalase and N-acetylcysteine, promoted Cav-1 downregulation and anoikis during cell detachment, indicating that produced hydrogen peroxide plays a primary role in preventing anoikis by stabilizing Cav-1 protein. Catalase and N-acetylcysteine promoted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Cav-1, which is a major pathway of its downregulation during cell anoikis. Furthermore, addition of hydrogen peroxide exogenously to the cells inhibited Cav-1 downregulation by preventing the formation of Cav-1-ubiquitin complex, supporting the inhibitory role of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in Cav-1 degradation during cell detachment. Together, these results indicate a novel role of hydrogen peroxide as an endogenous suppressor of cell anoikis through its stabilizing effect on Cav-1.",

The sequence of events leading to apoptosis following proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is unclear. Bortezomib effects on components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were examined: generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alteration in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. With human H460 lung cancer cells, bortezomib exposure at 0.1 microM showed induction of apoptotic cell death starting at 24 h, with increasing effects after 48-72 h of treatment. After 3-6 h, an elevation in ROS generation, an increase in Delta psi m, and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, were observed in a time-dependent manner. Co-incubation with rotenone and antimycin A, inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III, or with cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, resulted in inhibition of bortezomib-induced ROS generation, increase in Delta psi m, and cytochrome c release. Tiron, an antioxidant agent, blocked the bortezomib-induced ROS production, Delta psi m increase, and cytochrome c release. Tiron treatment also protected against the bortezomib-induced PARP protein cleavage and cell death. Benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of pan-caspase, did not alter the bortezomib-induced ROS generation and increase in Delta psi m, although it prevented bortezomib-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and apoptotic death. In PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells (with overexpression of Bcl-2), a reduction of bortezomib-induced ROS generation, Delta psi m increase was correlated with cellular resistance to bortezomib and the attenuation of drug-induced apoptosis. The transient transfection of wild type p53 in p53 null H358 cells caused stimulation of the bortezomib-induced apoptosis but failed to enhance ROS generation and Delta psi m increase. Thus ROS generation plays a critical role in the initiation of the bortezomib-induced apoptotic cascade by mediation of the disruption of Delta psi m and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.",

The present study aims to demonstrate the anti-drug resistance of YPFS in cisplatin (DDP)-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549/DDP). The application of YPFS exhibited a synergistic enhancement of DDP-induced cytotoxicity as well as of the apoptotic signalling molecules. DDP-induced expression of the multi-drug-resistance efflux transporters was markedly reduced in the presence of YPFS, resulting in a higher intracellular concentration of DDP. In addition, the application of YPFS increased DDP-induced ROS accumulation and MMP depletion, decreased p62/TRAF6 signalling in DDP-treated A549/DDP cells. The co-treatment of DDP and YPFS in tumour-bearing mice reduced the tumour size robustly (by more than 80%), which was much better than the effect of DDP alone. These results indicate that YPFS can notably improve the DDP-suppressed cancer effect, which may be a consequence of the elevation of intracellular DDP via the drug transporters as well as the down regulation of p62/TRAF6 signalling.

To further illustrate its potential as a high content and label free technique, it is important to show its capability to elucidate drug mechanisms of action and cellular resistances. In this study, cytotoxicity assays were employed to establish the toxicity profiles for 24 hr exposure of lung cancer cell lines, A549 and Calu-1, to the commercially available drug, doxorubicin (DOX). Raman spectroscopy, coupled with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and Flow Cytometry, was used to track the DOX mechanism of action, at a subcellular level, and to study the mechanisms of cellular resistance to DOX.

Crizotinib is effective in NSCLC that harbors ALK translocations resulting in overexpression of oncogenic ALK fusion proteins.;This paper will review crizotinib as a treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC. It will discuss the drug's adverse events, drug-drug interactions and other important clinical and safety information related to crizotinib.;Compared to standard chemotherapy, crizotinib shows improved progression-free survival in ALK-positive NSCLC, with patient's reporting improved quality of life. However, certain adverse events are more frequent with crizotinib versus standard chemotherapy and must be monitored for closely. The most common adverse events include ocular and gastrointestinal disturbances, cardiac and endocrine abnormalities, and peripheral edema. Many, though not all, of these side effects are likely due to the multiple tyrosine kinases inhibited by crizotinib, and will likely improve with second- and third-generation inhibitors that inhibit ALK more specifically.",

NAMPT, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the immediate precursor of NAD, is an attractive therapeutic target as inhibition of NAMPT reduces cellular NAD levels and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. However, there is limited understanding of the metabolic response to NAD depletion across cancer cell lines and whether all cell lines respond in a uniform manner. To explore this we selected two non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines that are sensitive to the NAMPT inhibitor GNE-617 (A549, NCI-H1334), one that shows intermediate sensitivity (NCI-H441), and one that is insensitive (LC-KJ). Even though NAD was reduced in all cell lines there was surprising heterogeneity in their metabolic response. Both sensitive cell lines reduced glycolysis and levels of di- and tri-nucleotides and modestly increased oxidative phosphorylation, but they differed in their ability to combat oxidative stress. H1334 cells activated the stress kinase AMPK, whereas A549 cells were unable to activate AMPK as they contain a mutation in LKB1, which prevents activation of AMPK. However, A549 cells increased utilization of the Pentose Phosphate pathway (PPP) and had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels than H1334 cells, indicating that A549 cells are better able to modulate an increase in oxidative stress. Inherent resistance of LC-KJ cells is associated with higher baseline levels of NADPH and a delayed reduction of NAD upon NAMPT inhibition. Our data reveals that cell lines show heterogeneous response to NAD depletion and that the underlying molecular and genetic framework in cells can influence the metabolic response to NAMPT inhibition.",

RH-1 action is associated with;quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) which reduces this diaziridinylbenzoquinone into DNA-alkylating hydroquinone and is overexpressed in many tumors. Another suggested mechanism of RH-1 toxicity is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising from its redox cycling. In order to improve anticancer action of this and similar antitumor quinones, we investigated the involvement of different signaling molecules in cytotoxicity induced by RH-1 by using wild-type tumor suppressor p53 bearing nonsmall cell lung carcinoma A549 cells as a model. Gradual and prolonged increase of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK, P38, and JNK phosphorylation was observed during 24-h RH-1 treatment. In parallel, activation of DNA damage-sensing ATM kinase, upregulation, and phosphorylation of TP53 (human p53) took place. Inhibition studies revealed that RH-1-induced A549 apoptosis involved the NQO1-ATM-p53 signaling pathway and ROS generation. TP53 participated in ROS- and DNA damage-induced cell death differently. Moreover, MAP kinase JNK was another TP53 activator and death inducer in A549 cells. At the same time, rapid and prolonged activation of AKT kinase during RH-1 treatment was found, and it proved to be antiapoptotic kinase in our model system. Therefore, we identified that different and opposite cell death regulating signaling pathways, which may counteract one another, are induced in cancer cells during chemotherapeutic RH-1 treatment.",

Biographical data, treatment patterns, and clinical impressions were analyzed by the generalized linear model and generalized estimating equations method.;There were 1231 responders overall (13.4% of those surveyed), including 628 (51%) radiation oncologists (RO), 587 (48%) medical oncologists (MO), 8 (0.6%) surgical oncologists, and 8 (0.6%) from other oncology subspecialties. Of respondents, 74% overall recommend PCI in limited-stage patients, including 65% of MO and 82% RO (p = 0.001). Of responders who recommend PCI in limited-stage patients, 67% do so only after complete response to initial therapy.

Interestingly, 38% of responding MO feel that PCI improves survival of limited-stage patients, but only 11% believe PCI improves quality of life. Of the RO, 48% believe PCI improves survival in limited-stage SCLC, and 36% feel PCI improves quality of life (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively).

Recently, the notion of using novel combinations of 'old' drugs for new indications has garnered significant interest. The potential of using phenothiazines as chemosensitizers has been suggested earlier but so far our understanding of their molecular targets remains scant. The current study was designed to better define phenothiazine-sensitive cellular processes in relation to chemosensitivity. We found that phenothiazines shared the ability to delay γH2AX resolution in DNA-damaged human lung cancer cells. Accordingly, cells co-treated with chemotherapy and phenothiazines underwent protracted cell-cycle arrest followed by checkpoint escape that led to abnormal mitoses, secondary arrest and/or a form of apoptosis associated with increased endogenous oxidative stress and intense vacuolation. We provide evidence implicating lysosomal dysfunction as a key component of cell death in phenothiazine co-treated cells, which also exhibited more typical hallmarks of apoptosis including the activation of both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. Finally, we demonstrated that vacuolation in phenothiazine co-treated cells could be reduced by ROS scavengers or the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin, leading to increased cell viability. Our data highlight the potential benefit of using phenothiazines as chemosensitizers in tumors that acquire molecular alterations rendering them insensitive to caspase-mediated apoptosis.",

The mechanisms involved in the signal transduction leading to these processes are the subject of intense investigation. In this review, some of the recent findings from our laboratories concerning key molecular events elicited by asbestos, crystalline silica, and chromium are presented.

We have previously shown that a combination of ionizing radiation (IR) and the staurosporine analog PKC 412, but not Ro 31-8220, increases cell death in NSCLC cells. To identify genes involved in the enhancement of cell death, a total gene profiling in response to co-administration of (i) PKC 412 with IR, or (ii) Ro 31-8220 with IR was implemented. These combined treatments caused upregulation of 140 and 179 genes and downregulation of 253 and 425 genes, respectively. Certain genes were selected and verified by real-time quantitative PCR and, of these genes, robust suppression of Ephrin B3 expression was suggested as a possible cell death-inducing mechanism of combined treatment with IR and PKC 412. Indeed, silencing of Ephrin B3 using siRNA in NSCLC cells resulted in a major alteration of their morphology with an elongated phenotype, decreased proliferation and increased cell death signaling. Moreover, silencing of Ephrin B3 in combination with IR caused a decrease in IR-mediated G(2)-arrest, induced cellular senescence, inhibited MAPK ERK and p38 phosphorylation, and caused an upregulation of p27(kip1) expression. Finally, silencing of Ephrin B3 in combination with IR sensitized U-1810 cells to IR-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, we identify and describe Ephrin B3 as a putative signaling molecule involved in the response of NSCLC cells to combined treatment with PKC 412 and ionizing radiation.",

However, cancer cells can take advantage of thioredoxin and DJ-1 against ROS-induced cell damage. In several human cancer types, thioredoxin and DJ-1 were found to be overexpressed. The present study aimed to explore the serum levels of thioredoxin and DJ-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and its relationship to the diagnosis and prognosis of this particular malignancy. Sera from 134 NSCLC patients and 168 healthy controls were obtained. Using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, the levels of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 were measured and correlated to the clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC patients. The diagnostic and prognostic significance of the biomarkers were evaluated by using receiver operating curve (ROC), Kaplan-Meier curve, and log-rank analyses and the Cox proportional hazard model, respectively. Serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 levels were significantly higher in the NSCLC patients than that in the controls (23.5 ± 6.57 vs. 13.8 ± 2.49 and 7.11 ± 2.02 vs. 5.18 ± 1.26, respectively). NSCLC patients at later stage cancer showed significantly higher levels of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 than those at the early stages (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high serum thioredoxin level was an independent risk factor for lymph nodal metastases and distant metastases (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI 1.26-3.41 and OR = 3.68, 95 % CI 2.16-5.33, respectively). In addition, an increase in the serum DJ-1 level was also identified as an independent risk factor for nodal metastases (OR = 1.37, 95 % CI 1.11-3.04). For predicting the development of NSCLC, ROC/area under the curve (AUC) analysis for thioredoxin indicated an AUC of 0.80 (sensitivity 0.62, specificity 0.92), and ROC/AUC analysis for DJ-1 showed an AUC of 0.78 (sensitivity 0.66, specificity 0.89). NSCLC patients with high serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 levels had lower survival rates than those with low levels, and multivariate analyses for overall survival revealed that high serum thioredoxin levels served as an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC (HR = 2.07, 95 % CI 1.19-3.48). Serum levels of thioredoxin and DJ-1 were significantly higher in NSCLC patients; therefore, these may be utilized as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC. ",

However, recent evidence has shown that irradiation can promote the invasion and metastasis of several types of cancer, and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism by which radiation enhances the invasiveness of NSCLC cells. We found that after irradiation, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) was increased and translocated into the nucleus, where it bound to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the CXCR4 promoter and promoted the transcription of CXCR4. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) also plays a role in the radiation-induced expression of CXCR4. Our results revealed that 2 Gy X-ray irradiation promoted the metastasis and invasiveness of H1299, A549 and H460 cells, which were significantly enhanced by SDF-1α treatment. Blocking the SDF-1α/CXCR4 interaction could suppress the radiation-induced invasiveness of NSCLC cells. The PI3K/pAkt and MAPK/pERK1/2 pathways were found to be involved in radiation-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. In vivo, irradiation promoted the colonization of H1299 cells in the liver and lung, which was mediated by CXCR4. Altogether, our findings have elucidated the underlying mechanisms of the irradiation-enhanced invasiveness of NSCLC cells. ",

In this study, we show that the mechanism by which activation of PPARγ inhibits proliferation of lung cancer cells is based on metabolic changes. We found that treatment with the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone triggers a metabolic switch that inhibits pyruvate oxidation and reduces glutathione levels. These PPARγ-induced metabolic changes result in a marked increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels that lead to rapid hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (RB) and cell-cycle arrest. The antiproliferative effect of PPARγ activation can be prevented by suppressing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) or β-oxidation of fatty acids in vitro and in vivo. Our proposed mechanism also suggests that metabolic changes can rapidly and directly inhibit cell-cycle progression of cancer cells by altering ROS levels.",

Here we present the first large scale RNA sequencing study of lung adenocarcinoma, demonstrating its power to identify somatic point mutations as well as transcriptional variants such as gene fusions, alternative splicing events, and expression outliers. Our results reveal the genetic basis of 200 lung adenocarcinomas in Koreans including deep characterization of 87 surgical specimens by transcriptome sequencing. We identified driver somatic mutations in cancer genes including EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, MET, and CTNNB1. Candidates for novel driver mutations were also identified in genes newly implicated in lung adenocarcinoma such as LMTK2, ARID1A, NOTCH2, and SMARCA4. We found 45 fusion genes, eight of which were chimeric tyrosine kinases involving ALK, RET, ROS1, FGFR2, AXL, and PDGFRA. Among 17 recurrent alternative splicing events, we identified exon 14 skipping in the proto-oncogene MET as highly likely to be a cancer driver. The number of somatic mutations and expression outliers varied markedly between individual cancers and was strongly correlated with smoking history of patients. We identified genomic blocks within which gene expression levels were consistently increased or decreased that could be explained by copy number alterations in samples. We also found an association between lymph node metastasis and somatic mutations in TP53.

In the present study, the immunostimulation of PRS was investigated in Lewis bearing-C57BL/6 mice while the induction of apoptosis in A549 cells was also studied. The treatment with PRS (2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg) significantly inhibited tumor, volume, and weight in the C57BL/6 mice. The rates of inhibition of PRS (at 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg) were 26.49 ± 17.30%, 40.32 ± 18.91% and 54.94 ± 16.48%, respectively. The spleen and thymus indexes were increased remarkably, while the levels of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-10 in serum were decreased according to ELISA assays. For A549 cells, Hoechst 33342 staining and annexin V/PI by flow cytometry showed that PRS (0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 mg/mL) induced nuclear changes of A549 cells with DNA condensation and fragmentations of chromatin, as well as inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, PRS could also attenuate the over-generation of intracellular ROS. Western blotting analysis showed a significant decrease on the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines MCP-1, IL-6 and TGF-β1, as well as cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1, by treatment with PRS. Our results demonstrated that the inhibition of PRS on tumor growth might be associated with the amelioration of inflammation responses, induction of apoptosis, as well as the decrease of ROS.

Preclinical studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated the enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human alveolar epithelial cells by proteasome inhibitors that up-regulate DR5 expression. This effect was blocked by DR5-neutralizing Ab. Using reporter assay, we demonstrated that the p53 and NF-kappaB elements on the DR5 first intron region were involved in proteasome inhibitor-induced DR5 expression. Both p53 small interfering RNA and NF-kappaB inhibitor suppressed DR5 expression, strengthening the significance of p53 and NF-kappaB in DR5 transcription. The protein stability, Ser(392) phosphorylation and Lys(373)/Lys(382) acetylation of p53 were enhanced by MG132. In addition to p53, IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB translocation was also observed. Moreover, the binding of p53 and p65 to the first intron of DR5 was demonstrated by DNA affinity protein-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation after MG132 treatment contributed to p53, but not p65 nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity. ROS scavenger dramatically inhibited the apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors plus TRAIL. The p53-null H1299 cells were resistant to proteasome inhibitor-induced DR5 up-regulation and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings reveal that proteasome inhibitor-mediated NF-kappaB and ROS-dependent p53 activation are contributed to intronic regulation of DR5 transcription, and resulted in the subsequent enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.",

Compared with controls, Papanicolaou-stained sputum samples showed 4 and 8 times higher prevalence of metaplasia and dysplasia, respectively, in AECs of BMF users. AgNOR staining showed significantly larger numbers of dots and larger size and percentage of AgNOR-occupied nuclear area in normal AECs of BMF users than in controls. Interestingly, AgNOR parameters increased dramatically when the cells were transformed from normalcy to metaplasia and dysplasia. Compared with LPG users, BMF users showed a marked rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and a depletion of superoxide dismutase (SOD), indicating oxidative stress. Indoor air of BMF-using households had 2-5 times more particulate pollutants (PM10 and PM2.5), 73% more nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and 4 times more particulate-laden benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P], but no difference in sulfur dioxide was observed. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) study estimated a 6-fold rise in benzene metabolite trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) in urine of BMF users.

Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur at a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will concentrate on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will concentrate on gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift in the personalized treatment of GC patients where multiplex comprehensive screening of all GC patients for all these potential driver mutations simultaneously is performed to achieve efficiencies and timeliness in diagnosis and allowing enrollment into different molecularly targeted therapy trials and the prospective discovery of novel yet unknown actionable driver mutations.

Angiogenesis is considered a fundamental requirement for tumorigenesis, but the mechanisms underlying the tumor angiogenesis induced by cadmium are poorly understood. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated the angiogenic mechanisms of cadmium in human bronchial epithelial cells and tumor formation. Our results demonstrated that cadmium (CdCl(2)) activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and AKT signaling and elevated the expression of a key downstream proangiogenic molecule hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in immortalized human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Cadmium also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which could be inhibited by ROS scavengers, catalase and diphenyleneiodonium chloride. Inhibition of ROS generation also attenuated ERK, AKT, p70S6K1 activation, and HIF-1α expression. Similar results were obtained in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, showing that cadmium induced HIF-1 expression via ROS/ERK/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, cadmium induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression and transcriptional activation through ROS, ERK, and AKT pathways. Finally, cadmium transformed human bronchial epithelial cells in culture; the transformed cells induced tube formation in vitro, angiogenesis on chicken chorioallantoic membrane, and formed tumors in nude mice. Taken together, the results of this study provide explanation for the role and molecular mechanisms of cadmium in promoting angiogenesis in lung epithelial cells and malignant transformation and will be helpful for improved occupational protection, prevention, as well as chemotherapy of human lung cancers caused by heavy metal cadmium.",

IOA was found to induce the arrest of G2-M phase, induce apoptosis, increase sub-G1, and inhibit the growth of these cells. Further investigation revealed that IOA's blockade of the cell cycle was associated with increased levels of p21/WAF1, p27 (kip1), and p53. In addition, IOA triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratios, resulting in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. We also found the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to be a critical mediator in IOA-induced inhibition of A549 cell growth. In antioxidant and NO inhibitor studies, we found that by pretreating A549 cells with either N-acetylcystenine (NAC), catalase, mannitol, dexamethasone, trolox, or L-NAME we could significantly decrease IOA production of ROS. Moreover, using NAC to block ROS, we could significantly suppress IOA-induced antiproliferation, antimigration, and anti-invasion. Finally, we found that IOA inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these results suggest that IOA has anticancer effects on A549 cells.",

This study was to determine whether the anti-tumor effect of tanshinone IIA (TSA) is NQO1 dependent and to elucidate the underlying apoptotic cell death pathways. NQO1(+) A549 cells and isogenically matched NQO1 transfected and negative H596 cells were used to test the properties and mechanisms of TSA induced cell death. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy and the tissue distribution properties of TSA were tested in tumor xenografted nude mice. We observed that TSA induced an excessive generation of ROS, DNA damage, and dramatic apoptotic cell death in NQO1(+) A549 cells and H596-NQO1 cells, but not in NQO1(-) H596 cells. Inhibition or silence of NQO1 as well as the antioxidant NAC markedly reversed TSA induced apoptotic effects. TSA treatment significantly retarded the tumor growth of A549 tumor xenografts, which was significantly antagonized by dicoumarol co-treatment in spite of the increased and prolonged TSA accumulations in tumor tissues. TSA activated a ROS triggered, p53 independent and caspase dependent mitochondria apoptotic cell death pathway that is characterized with increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-xl, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, cytochrome c release, and subsequent caspase activation and PARP-1 cleavage. The results of these findings suggest that TSA is a highly specific NQO1 target agent and is promising in developing as an effective drug in the therapy of NQO1 positive NSCLC.",

Recently, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Cav-1 proteins have been demonstrated to be highly associated with tumor metastasis and apoptosis resistance. Curcumin, a major active component of turmeric, Curcuma longa, has been shown to inhibit neoplastic evolution and tumor progression; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of curcumin on cell anoikis as a possible mechanism of anti-tumorigenic action of curcumin, and evaluated the potential role of Bcl-2 and Cav-1 in this process. Our results showed that ectopic expression of either Bcl-2 or Cav-1 induced anoikis resistance of lung carcinoma H460 cells. Curcumin downregulated Bcl-2 protein during anoikis and sensitized the cells to detachment-induced apoptosis, whereas it had no significant effect on Cav-1 protein expression. Bcl-2 down-regulation as well as anoikis enhancement by curcumin were inhibited by superoxide anion scavenger, Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride, but were unaffected by other ROS scavengers including catalase and deferoxamine, suggesting that superoxide anion is a key player in the downregulation of Bcl-2 by curcumin. Furthermore, we provided evidence that curcumin decreased Bcl-2 level through ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation which sensitized cells to detachment-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate a novel pathway for curcumin regulation of Bcl-2 and provide a key mechanism of anoikis regulation that may be exploited for metastatic cancer treatment.",

Herceptin is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of ErbB2. In this study, we aimed to block ErbB2 signaling with Herceptin and assess cytotoxicity and effects on apoptosis, oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), and Survivin expression in Calu-3 cell line. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were used to assess cell viability as a marker of proliferation.

Here we show that ectopic ATP synthase and the electron transfer chain exist on the plasma membrane in a punctuated distribution of lung adenocarcinoma cells, where it is critical to support cancer cell proliferation. Applying ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells. Analysis of protein expression profiles after citreoviridin treatment suggested this compound induced the unfolded protein response (UPR) associated with phosphorylation the translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), triggering cell growth inhibition. Citreoviridin-enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation could be reversed by siRNA-mediated attenuation of the UPR kinase PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) combined with treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, establishing that reactive oxygen species (ROS) boost UPR after citreoviridin treatment.

Compound 25 (SAN7401), the hydroquinone form of 22, induced a significant release of intracellular ROS and apoptosis (EC50 = 1.3-2.6 μM) in cancer cell lines, including A549 and HCT-116.

Another hydroquinone tethering 12-carbon chain, 26 (SAN4601), generated reduced levels of ROS but showed more potent cytotoxicity (EC50 = 0.8-1.6 μM) in cancer cells, although it lacked selectivity over noncancerous cells, implying that the naturally occurring 17-carbon chain is also crucial for ROS production and a selective anticancer effect. Both 25 and 26 displayed strong, equipotent activities against vemurafenib-resistant SK-Mel2 melanoma cells and p53-deficient H1299 lung cancer cells as well, demonstrating their broad therapeutic potential as anticancer agents.

Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of ROS kinase fusions in 8.7% (2 out of 23) of cholangiocarcinoma patients. Expression of the ROS fusions in 3T3 cells confers transforming ability both in vitro and in vivo, and is responsive to its kinase inhibitor. Our data demonstrate that ROS kinase is a promising candidate for a therapeutic target and for a diagnostic molecular marker in cholangiocarcinoma.

Although substantial, these advances remain hampered by the absence of an identified ligand, making ROS one of the last two remaining orphan receptor tyrosine kinases. Recent studies on the oncogenic activation of ROS as a result of different chromosomal rearrangements found in brain and lung cancers have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ROS transforming activities. ROS and its oncogenic variants therefore constitute clinically relevant targets for cancer therapeutic intervention.

We studied the participation of CYPs in corneal dysfunction caused by exposure to mainstream cigarette smoke (MCS) in a smoking rat model. Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to MCS. Exposure to MCS caused corneal damage and lacrimal gland dysfunction. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CYP1A1 expression was upregulated in the corneal epithelium and ducts of the lacrimal glands, accompanied by an increase in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). An increase in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, which is a marker of oxidative DNA damage, was detected only in areas where CYP1A1 was expressed, whereas the level of hexanoyl-lysine adduct, which is an initial marker of oxidative damage of phospholipids, did not increase.

The lungs are exposed daily to oxidants generated either endogenously or exogenously (air pollutants, cigarette smoke, etc.). Cells in aerobic organisms are protected against oxidative damage by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Recent epidemiologic investigations have shown associations between increased incidence of respiratory diseases and lung cancer from exposure to low levels of various forms of respirable fibers and particulate matter (PM), at occupational or urban air polluting environments. Lung cancer increases substantially for tobacco smokers due to the synergistic effects in the generation of ROS, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation with high DNA damage potential. Physical and chemical characteristics of particles (size, transition metal content, speciation, stable free radicals, etc.) play an important role in oxidative stress. In turn, oxidative stress initiates the synthesis of mediators of pulmonary inflammation in lung epithelial cells and initiation of carcinogenic mechanisms. Inhalable quartz, metal powders, mineral asbestos fibers, ozone, soot from gasoline and diesel engines, tobacco smoke and PM from ambient air pollution (PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅) are involved in various oxidative stress mechanisms. Pulmonary cancer initiation and promotion has been linked to a series of biochemical pathways of oxidative stress, DNA oxidative damage, macrophage stimulation, telomere shortening, modulation of gene expression and activation of transcription factors with important role in carcinogenesis.

Moderate expression of NOX5-L induced cell proliferation accompanied by AKT and ERK phosphorylation, whereas an increase in NOX5-L above a certain threshold promoted cancer cell death accompanied by caspase-3 activation. Notably, cisplatin treatment increased NOX5-L levels through CREB activation and enhanced NOX5-L activity through augmentation of Ca2+ release and c-Abl expression, ultimately triggering ROS-mediated cancer cell death-a distinct pathway absent in normal cells. These results indicate that NOX5-L determines cellular responses in a concentration- and context-dependent manner. ",

Thus RAS-driven tumor cells require redox-protective mechanisms to mitigate the damaging aspects of ROS. Here, we show that MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1), the mammalian 8-oxodGTPase that sanitizes oxidative damage in the nucleotide pool, is important for maintaining several KRAS-driven pro-malignant traits in a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) model. MTH1 suppression in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells impairs proliferation and xenograft tumor formation. Furthermore, MTH1 levels modulate KRAS-induced transformation of immortalized lung epithelial cells. MTH1 expression is upregulated by oncogenic KRAS and correlates positively with high KRAS levels in NSCLC human tumors. At a molecular level, in p53-competent KRAS-mutant cells, MTH1 loss provokes DNA damage and induction of oncogene-induced senescence. In p53-nonfunctional KRAS-mutant cells, MTH1 suppression does not produce DNA damage but reduces proliferation and leads to an adaptive decrease in KRAS expression levels. Thus, MTH1 not only enables evasion of oxidative DNA damage and its consequences, but can also function as a molecular rheostat for maintaining oncogene expression at optimal levels. Accordingly, our results indicate MTH1 is a novel and critical component of oncogenic KRAS-associated malignancy and its inhibition is likely to yield significant tumor-suppressive outcomes in KRAS-driven tumors.

We have therefore investigated the effect of an organic extract of diesel exhaust particles on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) status in human neutrophil granulocytes and rat alveolar macrophages in vitro. ROS formation were studied by three different assays namely the use of DCFH-DA, lucigenin and luminol. The organic extract increased ROS assayed with DCFH-DA, but it decreased the amount of ROS in cells stimulated by PMA in all three assays. The identities of the ROS affected were further studied in cell free systems. The cell free studies confirmed that the extract had scavenging effects against superoxide, hypochlorite and to a smaller extent against peroxynitrite, but not against the hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide. ROS take part in the intracellular signalling pathways as well as in the defence against invading microorganisms, and the possible effects of interference of the redox status in the cells are discussed.",

Combustion process and photochemical reactions are the major source of environmental ROS, and combustion process produced ROS has been gradually gaining attention in recent years. The purpose of this study is to determine the concentrations of ROS in the mainstream smoke of cigarettes sold in the marketplace using the DCFH2 fluorescence method and to understand particulate and gaseous concentrations of ROS. This research will also discuss the relationship between ROS and nicotine, found in popular cigarette brands, as well as the effectiveness of cigarette filters to remove ROS. Results indicate that the ROS concentration of mainstream smoke is 18.64-54.81 nmol H2O2/l while the correlation coefficients of nicotine and tar to total ROS are 0.959 and 0.909, respectively. Gaseous ROS concentrations are 14.32-39.03 nmol H2O2/l, and make up 71.21-85.99% of the total. It can be clearly seen therefore, that ROS exist mainly in the gaseous phase. Particulate ROS is dominant at PM2.5 (ROS(TSP)/ROS(PM2.5) is 0.652-0.959). The experimental results involving the tobacco leaves and cigarette ash show that ROS in mainstream smoke comes from the combustion process and not from the tobacco leaves. There is no effective means of eliminating ROS from mainstream smoke, regardless of whether a cigarette filter contains active charcoal.;This study showed that cigarette combustion will produce high concentration of ROS, and this high concentration of ROS in mainstream cigarette smoke probably is one major factor contributing to a high incidence of lung cancer in smokers.

These compounds and various analogs, which have been previously synthesized and tested for anti-lung cancer cell activity, were tested for anti-inflammatory activity. After preliminary screening for cytotoxicity for RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells, the non-toxic compounds were tested for anti-inflammatory activity using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 cells. Compounds 1h, 1i, and 1n reduced LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production, with respective ED50 values of 15 ± 2, 16 ± 2, and 17 ± 2 µM. They also reduced expression of inducible NO synthase and interleukin-6 (IL-6) without affecting cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Compound 1h also reduced secretion of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α by LPS-activated J774A.1 murine macrophage cells, primary mice peritoneal macrophages, and JAWSII murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and reduced NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion by LPS + adenosine triphosphate-activated J774A.1 and JAWSII cells. The underlying mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory activity of compound 1h were found to be a decrease in LPS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and NF-κB activation and a decrease in ATP-induced ROS production and PKC-α phosphorylation. These results provide promising insights into the anti-inflammatory activity of these conjugated polyenes and a molecular rationale for future therapeutic intervention in inflammation-related diseases.

Numerous studies have reported that the apoptosis was induced by ITCs through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of conjugating with and, consequently, depleting cellular glutathione. As electrophiles, ITCs could potentially trigger apoptosis by binding to macromolecules including DNA and proteins. The results showed that DNA damage may not be an important early event for the apoptosis induction by ITCs. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is a more potent inducer of apoptosis than sulforaphane (SFN) in A549 cells, but SFN induces more ROS generation and oxidative damages than PEITC, suggesting that oxidative stress again is probably not a trigger for apoptosis in these cells. In contrast, we found that PEITC binds more to intracellular proteins than SFN. We identified tubulin as 1 of the protein targets of ITCs through proteomics approach. We showed that the relative tubulin binding affinity of ITCs correlates well with their potency of cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction.

Knockdown of HRas by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. HRas siRNA also halted Raf, ERK, p53 activation and p21 accumulation. Molecular docking analysis suggested that WA could bind to HRas-GTP, causing accumulation of Ras-GTP and excessive activation of Raf/ERK/p53-p21.

In the absence of severe stresses, relatively low levels of p53 are sufficient for upregulation of several genes with antioxidant products, which is associated with a decrease in intracellular ROS. Downregulation of p53 results in excessive oxidation of DNA, increased mutation rate and karyotype instability, which are prevented by incubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Dietary supplementation with NAC prevented frequent lymphomas characteristic of Trp53-knockout mice, and slowed the growth of lung cancer xenografts deficient in p53. Our results provide a new paradigm for a nonrestrictive tumor suppressor function of p53 and highlight the potential importance of antioxidants in the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer.",

Although various mechanisms for the effects of LLLT have been proposed, and intracellular ROS were indicated as the one of the key factors, direct measurement of intracellular ROS of several types of cells after different wavelength lasers irradiation has not been reported.;Various types of cells were used in this study: mouse preadipocytes (3T3-L1), prechondrocytes (ATDC5), myoblasts (C2C12), mesenchymal stromal cells (KUSA-A1), lung cancer cells (LLC), insulinoma cells (MIN6), fibroblasts (NIH-3T3), human cervix adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), macrophages differentiated from lymphocytes (THP-1) after treatment with phorbol ester, and rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). Cells were irradiated with a blue laser (wavelength: 405 nm), a red laser (wavelength: 664 nm) or a near infrared laser (wavelength: 808 nm) at 100 mW/cm(2) for 60 or 120 sec. Intracellular ROS levels were measured by fluorometric assay using the intracellular ROS probe, CM-H2DCFDA in a flow cytometer.;After a blue laser irradiation, intracellular ROS levels were increased in all types of cells. In contrast, intracellular ROS generation was not observed after irradiation with a red laser or near-infrared laser.;Potential sources of intracellular ROS were excited by blue laser irradiation, resulting in ROS production within cells. Although the low-level intracellular ROS should be generated after a red or a near-infrared laser irradiation, the only high level intracellular ROS were detected by the ROS probe used in this study. As ROS are considered to be key secondary messengers, the specific functional regulation of cells by laser irradiation will be studied in a future study.",

Since many studies have reported that autophagy is involved in virus replication, we investigated whether autophagy also plays a role in the antiviral activity in A549 cells overexpressing CUG2 (A549-CUG2). We suppressed Atg5 or Beclin 1 expression using siRNA and examined its effect on the susceptibility of cells to infection by oncolytic VSV. We found that A549-CUG2 cells treated with Atg5 or Beclin 1 siRNA became susceptible to VSV infection, whereas A549-CUG2 cells treated with control siRNA were resistant. This result suggests that autophagy is involved in the antiviral response of A549-CUG2 cells. Further investigation revealed that autophagy impairment enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which resulted in inactivation of S6 kinase. Under these conditions, the levels of ISG15 transcript and protein decreased, which conferred on A549-CUG2 cell susceptibility to VSV infection. Finally, we found that overloading of H₂O₂ sensitized control A549-CUG2 cells to VSV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that autophagy impairment induces excessive ROS formation, which decreases S6 kinase activity and ISG15 expression, ultimately rendering the A549-CUG2 cells susceptible to VSV infection. We propose that autophagy impairment is a potential strategy for successful VSV virotherapy of CUG2-overexpressing tumors.",

In this study, we demonstrated that the pathway involved in SU11274-induced autophagy was presumably through inhibition of c-Met and its down-stream pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases – Akt (PI3K–Akt) and the growth factor receptor bound protein-2 / son of sevenless – Ras – p38 MAPK (Grb2/SOS–Ras–p38) pathway. SU11274 time-dependently induced the generation of superoxide anion (O2(•−)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). There is a negative feedback loop between reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction and SU11274. Then, we investigated the role of ROS in protecting cells against SU11274-induced autophagic cell death in A549 cells. O2(•−) and H2O2 generation activated c-Met–PI3K–Akt and c-Met–Grb2/SOS–Ras–p38 signaling pathways, which were suppressed by O2(•−) scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD) and H2O2 scavenger catalase. In conclusion, O2(•−) and H2O2 evoked cell resistance to SU11274 via activating c-Met–PI3K–Akt and c-Met–Grb2/SOS–Ras–p38 pathways in A549 cells.

Here, we explore whether APE1 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect ERK signaling and cell cycle progression following Pb exposure. We found that Pb induced APE1 expression and ROS generation in CL3 human lung cancer cells. The Pb-elicited ROS levels and cytotoxicity were further enhanced by introducing small interfering RNA specific for APE1 (siAPE1). E3330, an inhibitor of APE1 redox activity, also augmented the ROS levels and cytotoxicity in Pb-treated cells. Intriguingly, the capability of Pb to activate ERK was abolished under siAPE1 or E3330 co-treatments; conversely, forced expression of APE1 up-regulated the ERK activation by Pb or serum in both Cys65-redox activity dependent and independent manners. Moreover, APE1 formed complex with ERK2, and its redox activity could rescue ERK oxidative inactivation. APE1 redox activity also facilitated the Cyclin D1 expression and G1-to-S progression following Pb exposure. In summary, the results indicate that APE1 is a direct redox regulator of ERK for maintaining the kinase activity to promote cell proliferation.",

While the oncoprotein Mucin-1 (MUC1) performs multiple roles in the development of diverse human tumors, whether MUC1 is involved in acquired chemoresistance has not been determined. Using an acquired chemoresistance lung cancer cell model, we show that MUC1 expression was substantially increased in cells with acquired apoptosis resistance (AR). Knockdown of MUC1 expression effectively increased the sensitivity of these cells to the apoptotic cytotoxicity of anticancer therapeutics, suggesting that MUC1 contributes to acquired chemoresistance. Decreased catalase expression and increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were found to be associated with MUC1 overexpression. Scavenging ROS with butylated hydroxyanisole or supplying exogenous catalase dramatically suppressed MUC1 expression through destabilizing MUC1 protein, suggesting that reduced catalase expression mediated ROS accumulation is accounted for MUC1 overexpression. Further, we found that increased miR-551b expression in the AR cells inhibited the expression of catalase and potentiated ROS accumulation and MUC1 expression. Finally, by manipulating MUC1 expression, we found that MUC1 promotes EGFR-mediated activation of the cell survival cascade involving Akt/c-FLIP/COX-2 in order to protect cancer cells from responding to anticancer agents. Thus, our results establish a pathway consisting of miR-551b/catalase/ROS that results in MUC1 overexpression, and intervention against this pathway could be exploited to overcome acquired chemoresistance.

Cytotoxicity was assayed in terms of cell viability, DNA damage status, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. The results showed that all these four OPFRs could inhibit cell viability, overproduce ROS level, induce DNA lesions and increase the LDH leakage. In addition, the toxic effects of OPFRs in Caco-2 cells were relatively severer than those in HepG2 and A549 cells, which might result from some possible mechanisms apart from oxidative stress pathway. In conclusion, TBP, TPP, TBEP and TCPP could induce cell toxicity in various cell lines at relatively high concentrations as evidenced by suppression of cell viability, overproduction of ROS, induction of DNA lesions and increase of LDH leakage.

Although the role of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) in cell survival signaling is well documented, whether RIP1 is directly involved in cancer development has never been studied. In this report, we found that RIP1 expression is substantially increased in human non-small cell lung cancer and mouse lung tumor tissues. RIP1 expression was remarkably increased in cigarette smoke-exposed mouse lung. In human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), RIP1 was significantly induced by cigarette smoke extract or benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the active form of the tobacco-specific carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene. In RIP1 knockdown HBECs, BPDE-induced cytotoxicity was significantly increased, which was associated with induction of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. Scavenging ROS suppressed BPDE-induced MAPK activation and inhibiting ROS or MAPKs substantially blocked BPDE-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting ROS-mediated MAPK activation is involved in BPDE-induced cell death. The ROS-reducing enzyme catalase is destabilized in an ERK- and JNK-dependent manner in RIP1 knockdown HBECs and application of catalase effectively blocked BPDE-induced ROS accumulation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, BPDE-induced transformation of HBECs was significantly reduced when RIP1 expression was suppressed. Altogether, these results strongly suggest an oncogenic role for RIP1, which promotes malignant transformation through protecting DNA-damaged cells against carcinogen-induced cytotoxicity associated with excessive ROS production.

A role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in apoptosis induced by 4HPR in some cancer cells has been demonstrated recently. We studied five different human head and neck and five lung cancer cell lines to determine whether the ROS play a general role in 4HPR-induced apoptosis. We found that 4HPR induced apoptosis in all of the cell lines; however, this effect was blocked by antioxidants in only 2 of the 10 cell lines. 4HPR induced a greater than 4-fold increase in the generation of intracellular ROS in these two cell lines compared with a much lower effect in other cell lines. Furthermore, these two cell lines were most sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by 4HPR. The level of the cellular antioxidant thiol and superoxide dismutase activity were relatively lower in cells, which responded to 4HPR with a high level of ROS generation. These results indicate that although ROS can mediate 4HPR-induced apoptosis in some cells, which may have a low endogenous cellular antioxidant levels, other mechanisms exist for 4HPR-induced apoptosis. One such mechanism may involve retinoic acid receptors (RARs) because an RAR antagonist was able to block partially 4HPR-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, 4HPR-induced apoptosis involves at least three different mechanisms, which are complex and can overlap in the same cell line: (a) one mechanism involving 4HPR-induced ROS; (b) one involving RARs; and (c) at least one that does not involve ROS or RARs and remains unclear.",

Nitrosative stress induced necroptosis in A549 lung cancer cells, but resulted in caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in B16-F10 melanoma and MCF7 breast cancer cells. In addition, a decrease in GSH/GSSG levels accompanied with increased ROS production was observed. Reversal of ROS generation and cell death in GSH pretreated cells indicated the involvement of GSH depletion in MAM mediated cytotoxicity.

In vitro studies with various cancer cell lines have shown an increase in ROS and intracellular free zinc in cells treated with MGd. MGd increases cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and various chemotherapy agents and may be directly cytotoxic to tumor cells under certain conditions.

Treatment with ATO inhibited the growth of the Calu-6 cells at 72 hours. ATO induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; DeltaPsi(m)).

Yet, it is well established that most anticancer therapies depend on ROS production for efficient tumor eradication. Using several non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, we have dissected how the site of ROS production and accumulation in various cell compartments affect cell fate. We demonstrate that high levels of exogenously generated H2O2 induce extensive DNA damage, ATP depletion, and severe cytotoxicity. Although these effects were independent of caspase activity, they could-at least in part-be prevented by RIP1 kinase inhibition. In contrast, low levels of exogenously produced H2O2 triggered a modest drop in ATP level, delayed toxicity, G2/M arrest, and cell senescence. Mitochondrially produced H2O2 induced a reversible ATP drop without affecting cell viability. Instead, the cells accumulated in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and became senescent. Concomitant inhibition of glycolysis was found to markedly sensitize cells to death in the presence of otherwise nontoxic concentrations of H2O2, presumably by the inhibition of ATP-restoring mechanisms.

However, its clinical use is severely limited by the development of a progressive dose-dependent cardiomyopathy that results in irreversible congestive heart failure. To provide a strategy for constraining or minimizing the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP, a pirarubicin liposome powder (L-THP) was appropriately prepared, and the cumulative cardiotoxicity of L-THP and free THP (F-THP) were investigated on Sprague-Dawley rats after 3 successive doses. Urinary samples for metabonomic study, serum samples for biochemical assay, and heart samples for histopathology test were collected. As a result, the metabonomics-based findings such as PLS-DA plotting showed minimal metabolic alterations in L-THP as compared to F-THP, and correlated with the changes of serum biochemical assay and cardiac histopathology as measurements of damage to heart tissue. Our results confirm that when encapsulated into liposomes, the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP can be greatly ameliorated. Lipophilic aglycone metabolites of THP associated with redox cycling are cardiotoxic for the possibility of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Also, metabonomic analysis shows that the successive doses of THP will lead to severe metabolic pathways disturbances in the cell energy production.

However, little is known about relationship between proteasome inhibition and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in normal lung cells. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of MAPK inhibitors on MG132-treated human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells in relation to cell growth inhibition, cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH). Treatment with 15 μM MG132 increased ROS levels including mitochondrial O(2•)(-) and GSH depleted cell numbers in HPF cells at 24 hours. MAP kinase or ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor did not significantly affect cell growth inhibition, cell death, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; ΔΨ(m)), ROS level and GSH depletion in MG132-treated HPF cells. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor attenuated the growth inhibition and death by MG132. This inhibitor also significantly decreased O(2•)(-) level in MG132-treated HPF cells. Although p38 inhibitor slightly enhanced HPF cell growth inhibition by MG132, this inhibitor and siRNA prevented HPF cell death induced by MG132. p38 inhibitor also attenuated d O(2•)(-) level and GSH depletion. Moreover, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), JNK or p38 siRNA did not strongly affect ROS levels in MG132-treated HPF cells. ERK and JNK siRNAs decreased anonymous ubiquitinated protein levels in MG132-treated HPF cells. In conclusion, MAPK inhibitors differently affected the growth inhibition and death of MG132-treated HPF cells. Especially, p38 inhibitor attenuated HPF cell death by MG132, which was in part related to changes in ROS and GSH levels.",

Continuous administration of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a ROS inhibitor, before or after NNK treatment significantly blocked tumor development, although less effectively when BHA is administered after NNK treatment. Strikingly, BHA abolished the occurrence of F4/80+ macrophages with similar efficiency no matter whether it was administered before or after NNK treatment. Detection of cells from bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) confirmed that BHA markedly inhibited the accumulation of macrophages while slightly reducing the number of lymphocytes that were induced by NNK. Immunohistological staining showed that BHA specifically abolished the occurrence of CD206+ TAMs when it was administered before or after NNK treatment. Western blot analysis of TAMs markers, arginase I and Ym-1, showed that BHA blocked NNK-induced TAMs accumulation.

Studies to date have largely focused on silica-induced production of ROS by lung phagocytes. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that particulate silica (DQ12) can also induce elevations in intracellular ROS in a cancer-target cell type, i.e., human bronchial epithelial cells (BECs), via an indirect mechanism that involves ROS-inducing extracellular factor(s) that occur upon the interaction of silica with culture medium. The intracellular production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in BECs was assessed by flow cytometry via monitoring dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence. Culture medium containing 10% human serum was incubated with silica particles in concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 microg/ml, and following incubation for 1 h and removal of the particles, the resulting supernatants were added to BECs. Silica-treated medium induced significant increases in intracellular H(2)O(2) after the medium had been treated with as little as 10 microg/ml of the particles. Further, the level of ROS increases in BECs in response to silica-treated medium was found to be virtually identical to that induced in cells that were directly treated with silica in suspension. Based on enzyme inhibitory studies, the mechanism for this increased generation of intracellular ROS appears to involve both mitochondrial respiration and a NAD(P)H oxidase-like system. Spectrofluorimetric experiments with the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase showed that superoxide anions (O2*-) and H(2)O(2) are generated in silica-treated medium, but these ROS do not fully account for the induction of the intracellular ROS response. Iron, on the other hand, was found to be crucial to the process. Our collective results suggest silica-aqueous medium interactions can lead to the generation of factor(s) that induce the intracellular production of potentially DNA-damaging ROS in BECs in a manner that does not require direct particle-cell interactions.",

This is in contrast to normal cells, which primarily utilize oxidative phosphorylation for growth and survival. Here we report that the major function of glucose metabolism for Kras-induced anchorage-independent growth, a hallmark of transformed cells, is to support the pentose phosphate pathway. The major function of glycolytic ATP is to support growth under hypoxic conditions. Glutamine conversion into the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate through glutaminase and alanine aminotransferase is essential for Kras-induced anchorage-independent growth. Mitochondrial metabolism allows for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are required for Kras-induced anchorage-independent growth through regulation of the ERK MAPK signaling pathway. We show that the major source of ROS generation required for anchorage-independent growth is the Q(o) site of mitochondrial complex III. Furthermore, disruption of mitochondrial function by loss of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) gene reduced tumorigenesis in an oncogenic Kras-driven mouse model of lung cancer.

We investigated sources of, and the cellular response to, superoxide radical anion (O2 (·-)) generated in human A549 lung cancer cells after treatment with selenite. A temporal delay was observed between selenite treatment and increases in O2 (·-) production and biomarkers of apoptosis/necrosis, indicating that the reduction of selenite by the glutathione reductase/NADPH system (yielding O2 (·-)) is a minor contributor to ROS production under these conditions. By contrast, mitochondrial and NADPH oxidase O2 (·-) generation were the major contributors. Treatment with a ROS scavenger [poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated superoxide dismutase (SOD) or sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate] 20 h after the initial selenite treatment inhibited both ROS generation and apoptosis determined at 24 h. In addition, SOD1 was selectively upregulated and its perinuclear cytoplasmic distribution was colocalised with the cellular distribution of selenium. Interestingly, messenger RNA for manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, inducible haem oxygenase 1 and glutathione peroxidase either remained unchanged or showed a delayed response to selenite treatment. Colocalisation of Cu and Se in these cells (Weekley et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133:18272-18279, 2011) potentially results from the formation of a Cu-Se species, as indicated by Cu K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra. Overall, SOD1 is upregulated in response to selenite-mediated ROS generation, and this likely leads to an accumulation of toxic hydrogen peroxide that is temporally related to decreased cancer cell viability. Increased expression of SOD1 gene/protein coupled with formation of a Cu-Se species may explain the colocalisation of Cu and Se observed in these cells.",

Recent studies have suggested its anti-cancer effect in synovial sarcoma, lung cancer and hepatic cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for its anti-cancer effect still remains unclear. This study investigated the anti-tumor activity of sinomenine hydrochloride (SH), a hydrochloride form of sinomenine, in human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that SH potently inhibited cell viability of a broad panel of breast cancer cell lines. Two representative breast cancer cell lines, namely ER(-)/PR(-) MDA-MB-231 and ER(+)/PR(+) MCF-7, were used for further investigation. The results showed that SH induced G1/S cell cycle arrest, caused apoptosis and induced ATM/Chk2- and ATR/Chk1-mediated DNA-damage response in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The anti-cancer effect of SH was regulated by increased expression levels of p-ERK, p-JNK and p-38 MAPK. Further studies showed that SH resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) almost blocked SH-induced DNA damage but only mitigated SH-induced MAPK expression changes, suggesting that both ROS-dependent and -independent pathways were involved in MAPK-mediated SH-induced breast cancer cell death. The in vivo study demonstrated that SH effectively inhibited tumor growth without showing significant toxicity. In conclusion, SH induced breast cancer cell death through ROS-dependent and -independent pathways with an upregulation of MAPKs, indicating that SH may be a potential anti-tumor drug for breast cancer treatment.

Phx-3 suppressed the viability of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and induced cellular apoptosis 6 h after treatment. Prior to these events, intracellular pH (pHi) was rapidly decreased from pH 7.65 to 7.10 within 30 min when A549 cells were treated with 7 microM Phx-3. This intracellular acidification continued for 3 h in the cells. Augmented production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was obseved 1 h after treatment of A549 cells with 7 microM Phx-3, and cell cycle arrest at G1 was indicated 3 h after treatment. The translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytosol to the nucleus was clearly indicated 1 h after the administration of Phx-3 to A549 cells, while it was significantly suppressed when Nac, a scavenger of ROS, was added to the cells with Phx-3. The Phx-3-induced apoptosis in A549 cells was significantly suppressed when Nac was administered to the cells. These results suggest that a decrease of pHi, caused by depolarization of the mitochondria, may trigger the dysfunction of mitochondria causing ROS production; therefore, both the translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and apoptosis induction were promoted in A549 cells. Microscopic examination of the cellular localization of Phx-3 in A549 cells revealed that Phx-3 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, but not in the nucleus. The present results indicate that Phx-3 might be a strong anticancer drug against lung cancer, which is intractable to chemotherapy, by causing various early events, including the decrease of pHi and ROS production, and finally inducing cellular apoptosis.",

The comprehensive in vivo trials on three H22 tumor transplant models demonstrated that 9f improved the indexes in terms of inhibitive effect and lifespan extension and reduced the hematotoxicity which is one of main drawbacks of amonafide. More importantly, the obviously elevated ability in preventing lung cancer metastasis was observed, which increased the value of 9f as a promising lead compound.

In this work, a panel of diarylpentanoids as the curcumin mono-carbonyl analogs were designed and synthesized, and their cytotoxic and proapoptotic mechanisms against human lung cancer A549 cells were investigated at the frontiers of chemistry and biology. It was found that compared with curcumin, the compounds (A1, B1, and C1) bearing two ortho substituents on the aromatic rings, especially A1, exhibit significantly increased cytotoxic and proapoptotic activities through a Michael acceptor unit-dependent prooxidant-mediated mechanism. The prooxidative ability is governed not only by their electrophilicity but also by their geometry, cellular uptake and metabolic stability, and TrxR-inhibitory activity. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the compound A1 could effectively and irreversibly modify the TrxR by virtue of the above optimal biochemical parameters, and convert this antioxidant enzyme into a reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoter, resulting in a burst of the intracellular ROS including H2O2 and O2(-)•. The ROS generation is associated with falling apart in the redox buffering system, and subsequently induces increases in Ca(2+) influx and oxidative stress, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis. This work highlights the feasibility in designing curcumin-inspired anticancer agents by a prooxidant strategy, and gives us useful information on how to design them. ",

The 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay was performed to evaluate the antioxidant properties. Resveratrol had substantially high antioxidant capacity (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity value) compared to trolox and vitamin E since the concentration of resveratrol was more than 50 μM. Nanoparticles prepared from β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) were successfully developed. The β-lg nanoparticle showed 60 to 146 nm diameter in size with negatively charged surface. Non-cytotoxicity was observed in Caco-2 cells treated with β-lg nanoparticles. Fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated β-lg nanoparticles were identified into the cell membrane of Caco-2 cells, indicating that nanoparticles can be used as a delivery system. Hydrogen peroxide caused accumulation of ROS in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Resveratrol-loaded nanoparticles restored H2O2-induced ROS levels by induction of cellular uptake of resveratrol in A549 cells. Furthermore, resveratrol activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (Nrf2-Keap1) signaling in A549 cells, thereby accumulation of Nrf2 abundance, as demonstrated by western blotting approach.

This agent dose-dependently inhibited the growth of HPF cells with an IC50 of approximately 20 µM at 24 h and induced cell death accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; ∆Ψm) and an increase in caspase-3 and -8 activities. MG132 increased intracellular ROS levels and GSH-depleted cell numbers. However, all the tested caspase inhibitors intensified HPF growth inhibition by MG132 and caspase-9 inhibitor also enhanced cell death and MMP (∆Ψm) loss. Moreover, the administration of Bcl-2 siRNA augmented HPF cell death by MG132 whereas p53, Bax, caspase-3 and -8 siRNAs did not strongly affect cell death. In addition, each caspase inhibitor and siRNA differently affects ROS levels including O2•- regardless of cell growth inhibition and cell death levels.

However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in Cd pulmonary toxicity. In the present study, the effects of Cd exposure on human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) were evaluated by determination of lipid peroxidation, intra-cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and changes of mitochondrial membrane potential. A time- and dose-dependent increase of both lactate dehydrogenase leakage and malondialdehyde formation was observed in Cd-treated cells. A close correlation between these two events suggests that lipid peroxidation may be one of the main pathways causing its cytotoxicity. It was also noted that Cd-induced cell injury and lipid peroxidation were inhibited by catalase and superoxide dismutase, two antioxidant enzymes. By using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, a significant increase of ROS production in Cd-treated MRC-5 cells was detected. The inhibition of dichlorofluorescein fluorescence by catalase, not superoxide dismutase, suggests that hydrogen peroxide is the main ROS involved. Moreover, the significant dose-dependent changes of mitochondrial membrane potential in Cd-treated MRC-5 cells, demonstrated by increased fluorescence of rhodamine 123 examined using a laser-scanning confocal microscope, also indicate the involvement of mitochondrial damage in Cd cytotoxicity.

In liver or lung cancer cells treated with the anticancer drug epirubicin, TIGAR levels increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. TIGAR silencing enhanced epirubicin-induced elevations in ROS levels and apoptosis rates, in a manner that was blocked by ectopic addition of NADPH or N-acetyl cysteine. These findings were correlated with reduced tumorigenicity and increased chemosensitivity in mouse xenograft tumor assays. In parallel, TIGAR silencing also enhanced the epirubicin-induced activation of autophagy, in a manner that was also blocked by ectopic addition of NADPH. Notably, TIGAR silencing also licensed epirubicin-mediated inactivation of the mTOR pathway, suggesting TIGAR also exerted a negative impact on autophagy. However, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy increased epirubicin-induced apoptosis in TIGAR-silenced cells.

We hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation are involved in formaldehyde-induced genotoxicity in human lung cancer cell line, A549 cell line. To test the hypothesis, we investigated the effects of selenium on formaldehyde-induced genotoxicity in A549 cell lines. The results indicated that exposure to formaldehyde showed the induction of DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs). Formaldehyde significantly increased the malondialdehyde levels and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In addition, the activations of necrosis factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) were induced by the formaldehyde treatment. The pretreatment with selenium counteracted the formaldehyde-induced oxidative stress, ameliorated DPCs and attenuated the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in A549 cell lines.

Analysis yielded 20 novel genes differentially expressed in both lung adenomas and ACs versus normal lungs, including the tumor suppressor APC2 and the oncogene Ros 1. In addition, 50 genes were found to be differentially expressed in lung adenomas versus lung ACs, including the differentiation factor Hox C6, the oncogene Ets 2, and the Ras nuclear transport factor, nuclear transport factor 2. To understand the potential relationship between genes expressed in murine lung tumors and its relationship to altered gene expression observed during embryogenesis and postnatal development, tissues from embryonic lungs and from lungs of mice up to 4 weeks following birth were examined using Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips. From this analysis, approximately 1300 genes were determined to exhibit differential expression in fetal lung versus postnatal lung. When we compared lung adenomas, lung ACs, and normal lung parenchyma, 24 developmentally regulated genes were found aberrantly expressed in lung tumors; these included the cell cycle control factor CDC5, the cellular differentiation factor TEA domain 4, and the proapoptotic factor BNIP 2. Finally, we compared the murine lung tumor gene expression data to the expression of genes in human lung cancer, in order to assess the relevance of murine lung cancer models in the study of human AC formation.

Interestingly, the mouse lung adenomas appeared similar to 13 clustered ACs, while mouse lung ACs appeared more similar in pattern to the group consisting of four ACs and six large-cell carcinomas (LCCs).

However, the mechanisms of plumbagin's activities are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of plumbagin on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells as well as LLC lung cancer cells, SiHa cervical carcinoma cells. Plumbagin significantly decreased HepG2 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, treatment with plumbagin significantly increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3/7 activity. Using the similarity ensemble approach (SEA)-a state-of-the-art cheminformatic technique-we identified two previously unknown cellular targets of plumbagin: thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione reductase (GR). This was then confirmed using protein- and cell-based assays. We found that plumbagin was directly reduced by TrxR, and that this reduction was inhibited by the TrxR inhibitor, sodium aurothiomalate (ATM). Plumbagin also decreased the activity of GR. Plumbagin, and the GR inhibitor sodium arsenite all increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and this increase was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in HepG2 cells. Plumbagin increased TrxR-1 and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression and pretreatment with NAC significantly attenuated the plumbagin-induced increase of TrxR-1 and HO-1 expression in HepG2 cells, LLC cells and SiHa cells. Pretreatment with NAC significantly prevented the plumbagin-induced decrease in cell viability in these cell types.

However, whether wogonin enhances TRAIL's antitumor activity in vivo has never been studied. In this study, the effect of combination of TRAIL and wogonin was tested in a non-small-cell lung cancer xenografted tumor model in nude mice.

However, there are few experimental studies investigating S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), a water-soluble derivative of garlic. This study investigated whether SAMC prevented the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) from inducing precancerous activity in human lung cells (A549 cell line). A549 cells were either pre-treated (PreTM) or concurrently treated (CoTM) with 1μM B(a)P and either 10 or 50 μM SAMC. The 50 μM PreTM group inhibited B(a)P-induced cell proliferation by approximately 100%. The 50 μM SAMC PreTM and CoTM inhibited the B(a)P-induced G2/M phase shift by 100% and 97%, respectively. Furthermore, the PreTM and CoTM groups exhibited the potential to reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) relative to the B(a)P group by at least 78%. The SAMC PreTM elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) by approximately 100%. In this study, we revealed the mechanisms involved in SAMC inhibition of B(a)P-induced carcinogenesis, including suppression of cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, attenuation of ROS formation, inhibition of DNA damage, increase of SOD activity and inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity. SAMC appears to be a novel therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of B(a)P-induced human lung cancer.",

The mitotic kinase Nek6 has recently been shown to be overexpressed in various cancers and has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Previously, we reported that the down-regulation of Nek6 expression was required for p53-induced senescence. In this study, we examined the effect of Nek6 overexpression on the premature senescence of cancer cells induced by the anticancer drugs camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (DOX). We found that CPT- and DOX-induced morphology changes and increases in senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining were significantly inhibited in EJ human bladder cancer cells and H1299 human lung cancer cells overexpressing HA-Nek6. DOX-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and the reduction in cyclin B and cdc2 levels after DOX treatment were significantly reduced by Nek6 overexpression. In addition, an increase in the intracellular levels of ROS in response to DOX was also inhibited in cells overexpressing Nek6. These results suggest that the increased expression of Nek6 renders cancer cells resistant to premature senescence, and targeting Nek6 could be an efficient strategy for cancer treatment.",

In contrast, treatment with 5-10 microM of curcumin did not induce significant apoptosis, but rather induced G2/M-phase arrest in A-549 cells.

Augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high glycolytic flux are common characteristics of malignant cells. We thus evaluated the effect of resveratrol on cancer cell glucose metabolism and investigated the role of ROS in the response.;Cancer cells were measured for cell content and (18)F-FDG uptake. Assays were performed for lactate production; hexokinase activity and intracellular ROS; and immunoblotting for hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, and glucose transporter type 1 (Glut-1). Animal studies were performed with small-animal PET imaging of Lewis lung carcinoma tumor-bearing mice.;Resveratrol mildly decreased cell content and more pronouncedly suppressed (18)F-FDG uptake in Lewis lung carcinoma, HT-29 colon, and T47D breast cancer cells. Hence, (18)F-FDG uptake normalized to cell content was reduced to less than half of controls by 24-h exposure to resveratrol. This reduction was attributed to reduced glycolytic flux and Glut-1 expression. Resveratrol also decreased intracellular ROS in patterns that closely paralleled (18)F-FDG uptake. Scavenging of ROS with N-acetyl cysteine, but not inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, was sufficient to suppress (18)F-FDG uptake. Conversely, ROS inducers effectively reversed the metabolic response of resveratrol. HIF-1α protein was markedly reduced by resveratrol, and inhibiting HIF-1α expression with cycloheximide or specific small interfering RNAs suppressed (18)F-FDG uptake. The proteosomal inhibitor MG132 partly restored HIF-1α level and (18)F-FDG uptake in resveratrol-treated cells. Resveratrol also inhibited Akt activation; in addition, inhibitors and small interfering RNAs against phosphoinositide 3-kinase decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Finally, small-animal PET results showed resveratrol treatment to suppress tumor (18)F-FDG uptake in vivo.;Resveratrol suppresses cancer cell (18)F-FDG uptake and glycolytic metabolism in a manner that depends on the capacity of resveratrol to inhibit intracellular ROS, which downregulates HIF-1α accumulation.",

Therefore, in this study we investigated the promotion of tumor cell invasion and the expression of metastasis-associated proteins by inducing the up-regulation of HO-1 expression by HG treatment in A549 human lung epithelial cells.;The expression of HO-1and metastasis-associated protein expression was explored by western blot analysis. HO-1 enzymatic activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and TGF-β1 production were examined by ELISA. Invasiveness was analyzed using a Transwell chamber.;HG treatment of A549 cells induced an increase in HO-1 expression, which was mediated by the HG-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Following the increase in HO-1 expression, the enzymatic activity of HO-1 also increased in HG-treated cells. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt inhibitors attenuated the HG-induced increase in HO-1 expression. HG treatment of A549 cells enhanced the invasion potential of these cells, as shown with a Transwell assay, and increased metastasis-associated protein expression. However, HO-1 siRNA transfection significantly decreased these capabilities.;this study is the first to demonstrate that HG treatment of A549 human lung epithelial cells promotes tumor cell invasion and increases metastasis-associated protein expression by up-regulating HO-1 expression via ROS or the TGF-β1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

The form of asbestos in the contaminated vermiculite has been characterized in the amphibole family of fibers. However, the pathogenic effects of these fibers have not been previously characterized. The purpose of this study is to determine the cellular consequences of Libby amphibole exposure in macrophages compared to another well-characterized amphibole fiber; crocidolite asbestos. Our results indicate that Libby asbestos fibers are internalized by macrophages and localize to the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic vacuoles similar to crocidolite fibers. Libby asbestos fiber internalization generates a significant increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as determined by dichlorofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidine fluorescence indicating that the superoxide anion is the major contributing ROS generated by Libby asbestos. Elevated superoxide levels in macrophages exposed to Libby asbestos coincide with a significant suppression of total superoxide dismutase activity. Both Libby and crocidolite asbestos generate oxidative stress in exposed macrophages by decreasing intracellular glutathione levels. Interestingly crocidolite asbestos, but not Libby asbestos, induces significant DNA damage in macrophages. This study provides evidence that the difference in the level of DNA damage observed between Libby and crocidolite asbestos may be a combined consequence of the distinct chemical compositions of each fiber as well as the activation of separate cellular pathways during asbestos exposure.",

While occupational exposure to metallic Co alone is apparently not associated with an increased risk of cancer, the WC-Co particle mixture was shown to increase the risk of lung cancer in exposed workers. We have previously shown that WC-Co specifically induces a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in vitro mutagenic/apoptogenic effects in human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) used as a validated experimental model. In the present study, PBMCs were treated during a short period (15 min) to focus on the very rapid ROS burst induced by WC-Co. We investigated by microarray the response to WC-Co versus Co(2+) ions (CoCl(2)) after 15 min exposure and found that the oxidative stress response HMOX1 gene was highly expressed in WC-Co-treated samples. This result was confirmed by qRT-PCR, and western blotting was carried out to analyze translational and post-translational regulation of genes belonging to the HMOX1 pathway. We show here that WC-Co, and metallic Co particles although with slower kinetics, but not CoCl(2) or WC alone, induced a temporally ordered cascade of events. This cascade implies p38/MAP kinase activation, HIF-1α stabilization, HMOX1 transcriptional activation, and ATM-independent p53 stabilization.

The anticancer behavior has been improved by the metal complex generated with the flavonoid and the oxidovanadium(IV) ion. This new complex, [VO(dios)(OH)3]Na5·6H2O (VOdios), has been synthesized and characterized both in solid and solution states. The interaction of the metal ion through the sugar moiety of diosmin precluded the improvement of the antioxidant effects. However, the cell-killing effects tested in human lung A549 and breast T47D, SKBR3 and MDAMB231 cancer cell lines, were enhanced by complexation. The anti-proliferative effects on the human lung cancer cell line were accompanied by cellular ROS generation and an increase in cytoplasm condensation. The breast cancer cell lines did not produce caspase3/7 activation, mitochondrial potential reduction and ROS generation. Therefore, a non-apoptotic form of cell death in a caspase- and oxidative stress-independent manner has been proposed. The protein binding ability has been monitored by the quenching of tryptophan emission in the presence of the compounds using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein.

In the present study, wistar rats and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were long-term exposed to radon, and then alterations in histological pathology of rat lung tissue, ROS, antioxidant enzymes activities and clonogenic formation in HBE cells, as well as changes in let-7 and K-ras expression were determined to observe the adverse effects induced by radon. The results showed that long-term exposure to radon produced severe lung damage in rats, significantly increased ROS production and clonogenic formation ratios and decreased SOD activities in HBE cells. In addition, an obvious down-regulation of let-7 and up-regulation of K-ras were also revealed both in mRNA and in protein level in lung tissue of rats and HBE cells exposed to radon. Furthermore, a significant down-regulation of K-ras was then confirmed in both let-7b-3p and let-7a-2-3p transfected HBE cells.

Most of the conjugates exhibited significant anticancer activity against some representative human cancer cell lines and two of the conjugates 6d and 7c displayed potent cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 53 nM and 44 nM against A549 human lung cancer respectively, and were comparable to combretastatin A-4 (CA-4). SAR studies revealed that 1-benzyl substituted triazole moiety with an amide linkage at 3-position of B-ring of the combretastatin subunit are more active compared to 2-position. G2/M cell cycle arrest was induced by these conjugates 6d and 7c and the tubulin polymerization assay (IC50 of 1.16 μM and 0.95 μM for 6d and 7c, respectively) as well as immunofluorescence analysis showed that these conjugates effectively inhibit microtubule assembly at both molecular and cellular levels in A549 cells. Colchicine competitive binding assay suggested that these conjugates bind at the colchicine binding site of tubulin as also observed from the docking studies. Further, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS generation, caspase-3 activation assay, Hoechst staining and DNA fragmentation analysis revealed that these conjugates induce cell death by apoptosis.",

Several quinone methide-containing triterpenes (QMTs) enhanced the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation (IR) and of these QMTs, celastrol (CE) had the greatest enhancing effect on IR-induced cell death in vitro. Additionally, the quinone methide moiety of CE was shown to be essential for CE-mediated radiosensitization; in contrast, dihydrocelastrol (DHCE), does not contain this moiety. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by IR was augmented in combination with CE, which was responsible for CE-mediated radiosensitization. CE induced the thiol reactivity and inhibited the activities of antioxidant molecules, such as thioredoxin reductase and glutathione. In vivo, nude mouse xenografting data also revealed that tumor growth delay was greater in mice treated with CE plus IR, compared with those treated with CE or IR alone. When DHCE, instead of CE, was combined with IR, tumor growth delay was similar to that in IR alone-treated mice.

The human lung carcinoma cell line, NCI-H1299, shows resistance to conventional cancer treatments, such as ionizing radiation (IR) and cisplatin, while the lung carcinoma cell line, NCI-H460, is sensitive to treatment with these agents. However, when treated with a chalcone compound [toluenesulfonylamido-chalcone, 4'-(p-toluene sulfonyl amino)-3,4-dihydroxy chalcone (TSHDC)], cell death was dramatically induced in NCI-H1299 cells as compared to NCI-H460 cells. TSHDC-mediated cytotoxicity was not dependent on the status of p53 and p21. However, TSHDC exerted increased c-Myc-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in NCI-H1299 cells in which c-Myc is overexpressed, while increased ROS production did not occur in A549 or NCI-H460 cells with a low c-Myc level. Several colon and brain cancer cells also showed a correlation between c-Myc expression and TSHDC-mediated increased cell death. Tumor regression by TSHDC was more dramatic in NCI-H1299 cells than NCI-H460 cells, when these cells were grafted to nude mice. However, in the case of IR and cisplatin, NCI-H460 cells were more sensitive than NCI-H1299 cells.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is an active anti-oxidative component obtained from propolis, and has been shown to have beneficial effects on several respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. However, the impact of CAPE on asthma is not well understood. Therefore, this study investigated the advantages of using CAPE to treat asthma and demonstrated the roles of CAPE in the regulation of airway microenvironments. In ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice, CAPE treatments notably reduced airway hyperresponsiveness, attenuated extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and inhibited goblet cell hyperplasia and collagen deposition and fibrosis. In addition, CAPE improved the airway microenvironment in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting OVA-induced increases in immunoglobulin E, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 and suppressing matrix metalloproteinase-9 and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression as well as malondialdehyde production. To determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects, we used TNF-α-stimulated BECs and TGF-β1-challenged human ASMCs to explore the impacts of CAPE on pro-inflammatory proteins and ASMC proliferation. The results indicated that CAPE significantly limited the secretion of eotaxin-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and dramatically inhibited the proliferation of ASMCs. These effects were shown to be associated with decreased reactive oxidant species (ROS) levels. The phosphorylation of Akt and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) caused by increased ROS was significantly decreased by CAPE, which implied a contribution of ROS-MAPK/Akt signaling to the attenuation of asthma. Our findings indicated for the first time that CAPE alleviates airway inflammation and remodeling in chronic asthma by balancing the airway microenvironment, which highlights a novel profile of CAPE as a potent agent for asthma management.",

In order to explain this it has been suggested that at high serum levels of beta-carotene, prooxidant characteristics of beta-carotene may become manifest, yielding reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducing oxidative DNA damage. It has further been hypothesized that cigarette smoke carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and/or B[a]P metabolites, may directly react with beta-carotene. Furthermore, beta-carotene oxidation products may have a role in the bioactivation of B[a]P analogous to the peroxide shunt pathway of cytochrome P450 supported by cumene hydroperoxide. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of beta-carotene on the formation of B[a]P-DNA adducts and oxidative DNA damage in vitro in isolated DNA, applying as metabolizing systems rat liver and lung metabolizing fractions and lung metabolizing fractions from smoking and non-smoking humans. We established that beta-carotene in the presence of various metabolizing systems was unable to induce oxidative DNA damage (8-oxo-dG), although beta-carotene is capable of generating ROS spontaneously in the absence of metabolizing fractions. We also could not find an effect of beta-carotene on DNA adduct formation induced by B[a]P upon metabolic activation.

However, the way in which beta-HIVS induces apoptosis remains to be clarified. In this study, we performed cDNA array analysis and found that beta-HIVS suppressed the expression of the gene for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), which is a member of the heat-shock family of proteins. When human leukemia HL60 cells and human lung cancer DMS114 cells were treated with beta-HIVS, the amount of TRAP1 in mitochondria decreased in a time-dependent manner during apoptosis. A similar reduction in the level of TRAP1 was also observed upon exposure of cells to VP16. Treatment of DMS114 cells with TRAP1-specific siRNA sensitized the cells to beta-HIVS-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the reduction in the level of expression of TRAP1 by TRAP1-specific siRNA enhanced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria when DMS114 cells were treated with either beta-HIVS or VP16. The suppression of the level of TRAP1 by either beta-HIVS or VP16 was blocked by N-acetyl-cysteine, indicating the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the regulation of the expression of TRAP1.

The silicotic pathology owes its severity to the structural and chemo-physical properties of the particles such as shape, size and abundance of surface radicals. In earlier studies, we reported that significant amounts of surface radicals can be generated on crystalline silica by chemical aggression with ascorbic acid (AA), a vitamin naturally abundant in the lung surfactant, and this reaction led to enhanced cytotoxicity and production of inflammatory mediators in a macrophage cell line. However in the lung, other cells acting in the development of silicosis, like fibroblasts and endothelial cells, can come to direct contact with inhaled quartz. We investigated the cytotoxic/pro-inflammatory effects of AA-treated quartz microcrystals (QA) in human primary fibroblasts and endothelial cells as compared to unmodified microcrystals (Q). Our results show that, in fibroblasts, the abundance of surface radicals on quartz microcrystals (Q vs QA) significantly enhanced cell proliferation (with or without co-culture with macrophages), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, NF-κB nuclear translocation, smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, Bcl-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression and collagen production. Contrariwise, endothelial cells reacted to the presence of quartz microcrystals independently from the abundance of surface radicals showing similar levels of cytotoxicity, ROS production, cell migration, MCP-1, ICAM-I and fibronectin gene expression when challenged with Q or QA. In conclusion, our in vitro experimental model demonstrates an important and quite unexplored direct contribute of silica surface radicals to fibroblast proliferation and fibrogenic responses. ",

In previous studies, fast binding to albumin as well as transferrin could be shown. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is diversely being exploited for tumor targeting, could therefore be applicable for NKP-1339. Here we studied the serum dependence of its biological activity in various methods, influencing its cellular accumulation, cytotoxicity as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS lead to Nrf2 activation, which is known to activate antioxidant response gene transcription. GRP78 down-regulation on the protein level suggests ER associated protein degradation (ERAD) as a mode of action, as RNA levels are only mildly affected. Another important part for the mode of action is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as different factors are highly upregulated on the protein level. For example PERK, a transmembrane receptor which is released by GRP78 when the ER is disturbed, is upregulated and phosphorylated. EIF2α is phosphorylated, which leads to an inhibition of CAP-dependent translation and other stress responses. The transcription factor CHOP (DDIT3), which promotes ER stress dependent apoptosis, is time and concentration dependently upregulated. Finally cytotoxicity tests could prove that inhibition of ER stress and ER stress-mediated apoptosis leads to decreased cytotoxic effects of NKP-1339, which highlights the involvement of this mechanism in the mode of action.

The characterization of ρ- cells indicated the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria and might thus serve a reliable model to investigate the role of mitochondria. In a gas inhalation chamber, ρ- and ρ+ cells were exposed to radon gas produced by a radium source. Results showed that apoptosis was significantly increased both in ρ- and ρ+ cells irradiated by radon. Moreover, apoptosis in ρ- cells showed a lower level than in ρ+ cells. Radon was further found to depress mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of HBE cells with knockdown mtDNA. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was markedly elevated both in ρ- and ρ+ cells exposed to radon. The distribution of phases of cell cycle was different in ρ- compared to ρ+ cells. Radon irradiation induced a rise in G2/M and decrease in S phase in ρ+ cells. In ρ- cells, G1, G2/M, and S populations remained similar to cells exposed to radon. In conclusion, radon-induced changes in ROS generation, MMP and cell cycle are all attributed to reduction of apoptosis, which may trigger and promote cell transformation, leading to carcinogenesis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Exposure to asbestos fibers increases the risk of development of mesotheliomas and lung carcinomas, but not fibrosarcomas. We present data suggesting that resistance of fibroblasts to asbestos-induced carcinogenesis is likely to be connected with their lower ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to asbestos exposure and stricter control of proliferation of cells bearing asbestos/ROS-induced injuries. In fact, chrysotile (Mg6Si4O10(OH)8) asbestos exposure (5-10 microg/cm2) increased intracellular ROS and 8-oxo-guanine contents in rat pleural mesothelial cells, but not in lung fibroblasts. Simultaneously, moderate dosages of chrysotile and other agents increasing ROS levels (hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 and ethyl-methanesulfonate, EMS) inhibited cell cycle progression, in particular G1-to-S transition, in fibroblasts, but not in mesothelial cells. The arrested fibroblasts underwent cell death, while the majority of chrysotile-treated mesothelial cells survived. The differences in cell cycle response to asbestos/ROS-induced injuries correlated with distinct activity of p53-p21Cip1/Waf1 pathway in the two cell types. Chrysotile, H2O2 and EMS caused p53 upregulation in both cell types, but mesothelial cells, unlike fibroblasts, showed no accumulation of p21Cip1/Waf1. Of note, treatment with doxorubicin caused similar p53-dependent p21Cip1/Waf1 upregulation and cell cycle arrest in both cell types. This suggests differential response of fibroblasts and mesothelial cells specifically to asbestos/ROS exposure rather than to all DNA-damaging insults.",

In the present study, BEAS2B cells were directly exposed twice to 20,000 Bq/m(3) radon gas for 20 min once (first passage) and subsequently 10 times (fifth passage). The fifth-passage cells were then subcultured for 1 and 20 generations (named Rn5-1 and Rn5-20, respectively). Molecular mechanisms indicative of malignant transformation were assessed by determination of apoptosis, seroresistance, and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles. The microRNA profiles were used to assess the functional annotations of the target genes. Data indicated an increased seroresistance and colony efficiency on soft agar, and enhanced apoptosis resistance in the Rn5-20 cells with significant differential expressions in some miRNA, including hsa-miR-483-3p, hsa-miR-494, hsa-miR-2115*, hsa-miR-33b, hsa-miR-1246, hsa-miR-3202, hsa-miR-18a, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-17*, and hsa-miR-886-3p.

We report herein the development of a novel nanoscale drug delivery system (nDDS) based nanotherapeutic that combines chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) into one single platform to achieve synergistic anticancer capacity to conquer cisplatin resistance. Mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNs) was used as the drug delivery vector to conjugate cisplatin prodrug and to load photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) to afford the dual drug loaded delivery system MSNs/Ce6/Pt. The hybrid nanoparticles have an average diameter of about 100 nm and slightly positive surface charge of about 18.2 mV. The MSNs/Ce6/Pt nanoparticles can be efficiently internalized by cells through endocytosis, thereby achieving much higher cellular Pt uptake than cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant A549R lung cancer cells. After 660 nm light irradiation (10 mW/cm(2)), the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in MSNs/Ce6/Pt treated cells was elevated dramatically. As a result of these properties, MSNs/Ce6/Pt exhibited very potent anticancer activity against A549R cells, giving a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for the combination therapy of 0.53 μM, much lower than that of cisplatin (25.1 μM).

In cells lacking p53, DNA damage does not trigger an effective cell-cycle arrest and in this setting promotes gene amplification.

This study focused on the effects of v-K-ras and p53 on Methotrexate (MTX)-mediated DHFR amplification. Rat lung epithelial cells expressing v-K-ras or murine lung cancer LKR cells harboring active K-ras continued cell-cycle progression when treated with MTX. However, upon loss of p53, amplification of DHFR and formation of MTX-resistant colonies occurred. Expression levels of cyclin A, Geminin, and Cdt1 were increased in v-K-ras transfectants. Geminin was sufficient to prevent the occurrence of multiple replications via interaction with Cdt1 after MTX treatment, and DHFR amplification proceeded in v-K-ras transfectants that possess a functional p53 in the absence of geminin. Taken together, our findings indicate that p53 not only regulates cell-cycle progression, but also functions through geminin to prevent DHFR amplification and protect genomic integrity.",

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by logistic regression. Nested case-control analyses included study participants with available DNA (n = 533 cases and 1,470 controls), matched for race, age, and length of follow-time. Overall, there were no associations between genotypes of MnSOD, CAT, and GPX1 and prostate cancer risk, although among men diagnosed before age 65, CAT TT genotype was associated with increased risk (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.97-3.95). Further analyses stratified by factors related to environmental oxidative stress exposures did not modify associations. When calculating the number of risk alleles of MnSOD, CAT, and GPX1 hypothetically related to reduced protection against ROS, there was a nonsignificant relationship between prostate cancer and carriage of five or more risk alleles, in comparison to men with less than five risk alleles (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.90-4.42).

Our results showed that quercetin decreased ROS generation induced by Cr(VI) exposure in BEAS-2B cells. Chronic Cr(VI) exposure induced malignant cell transformation, increased miR-21 expression and caused inhibition of PDCD4, which were significantly inhibited by the treatment of quercetin in a dose dependent manner. Nude mice injected with BEAS-2B cells chronically exposed to Cr(VI) in the presence of quercetin showed reduced tumor incidence compared to Cr(VI) alone treated group. Stable knockdown of miR-21 and overexpression of PDCD4 or catalase in BEAS-2B cells suppressed Cr(VI)-induced malignant transformation and tumorigenesis.

Although the mechanism underlying the correlation between PM2.5 exposure and adverse effects has not fully elucidated, PM2.5-induced oxidative stress has been considered as an important molecular mechanism of PM2.5-mediated toxicity. In this work, human lung epithelial A549 cells were used to further investigate the biological effects of PM2.5 on autophagy. The cell viability showed both time- and concentration-dependent decrease when exposure to PM2.5, which can be attributed to increase of the levels of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in A549 cells. Moreover, PM2.5-induced oxidative damage in A549 cells was observed through the alteration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities compared to the unexposed control cells. PM2.5-induced autophagy was indicated by an increase in microtubule-associated protein light chain-3 (LC3) puncta, and accumulation of LC3 in both time- and concentration-dependent manner. PM2.5-induced mRNA expression of autophagy-related protein Atg5 and Beclin1 was also observed compared with those of the unexposed control cells.

In the present study, the synergistic effect between SEP and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a traditional cytotoxic drug, in vitro and in vivo was investigated. The results obtained indicated that SEP alone stimulated NK-92 cytotoxicity and coordinated with 5-FU to augment the cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells against HepG-2 or A549 cells in vitro. SEP promoted NK-92 activity by stimulating NKG2D and its downstream DAP10/PI3K/Erk signaling pathway. Additionally, 5-FU could increase MICA expression on HepG-2 or A549 cells and prevent membrane MICA from shedding as soluble MICA, which were abrogated in the tumor cells transfected with ADAM 10 overexpression plasmid. Moreover, in H22- or Lewis lung cancer (LLC)-bearing mouse models, SEP reversed 5-FU-induced atrophy and apoptosis in both the spleen and bone marrow in vivo by suppressing ROS generation and caspase-3 activation.

Using human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells, we provide evidence for the metabolic activation of (+/-)-trans-7,8dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol) by aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) to yield benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione (B[a]P-7,8-dione), a redox-active o-quinone. We show that B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol (AKR substrate) and B[a]P-7,8-dione (AKR product) lead to the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (measured as an increase in dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluores-cence) and that similar changes were not observed with the regioisomer (+/-)-trans-4,5-dihydroxy-4,5-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene or the diol-epoxide, (+/-)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9alpha,10beta-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-B[a]P. B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol and B[a]P-7,8-dione also caused a decrease in glutathione levels and an increase in NADP(+)/NADPH ratios, with a concomitant increase in single-strand breaks (as measured by the comet assay) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo). The specificity of the comet assay was validated by coupling it to human 8-oxo-guanine glycosylase (hOGG1), which excises 8-oxo-Gua to yield single-strand breaks. The levels of 8-oxo-dGuo observed were confirmed by an immunoaffinity purification stable isotope dilution ([(15)N(5)]-8-oxo-dGuo) liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MRM/MS) assay. B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol produced DNA strand breaks in the hOGG1-coupled comet assay as well as 8-oxo-dGuo (as measured by LC-ESI/MRM/MS) and was enhanced by a catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, suggesting that COMT protects against o-quinone-mediated redox cycling. We conclude that activation of PAH-trans-dihydrodiols by AKRs in lung cells leads to ROS-mediated genotoxicity and contributes to lung carcinogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cadmium is an established human and animal carcinogen. Most evidence is available for elevated risk for lung cancer after occupational exposure; however, associations between cadmium exposure and tumors at other locations including kidney, breast, and prostate may be relevant as well. Furthermore, enhanced cancer risk may not be restricted to comparatively high occupational exposure, but may also occur via environmental exposure, for example in areas in close proximity to zinc smelters. The underlying mechanisms are still a matter of manifold research activities. While direct interactions with DNA appear to be of minor importance, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been detected in diverse experimental systems, presumably due to an inactivation of detoxifying enzymes. Also, the interference with proteins involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, the deregulation of cell growth as well as resistance to apoptosis appears to be involved in cadmium-induced carcinogenicity. Within this context, cadmium has been shown to disturb nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. Particularly sensitive targets appear to be proteins with zinc-binding structures, present in DNA repair proteins such as XPA, PARP-1 as well as in the tumor suppressor protein p53. Whether or not these interactions are due to displacement of zinc or due to reactions with thiol groups involved in zinc complexation or in other critical positions under realistic exposure conditions remains to be elucidated. Further potential mechanisms relate to the interference with cellular redox regulation, either by enhanced generation of ROS or by reaction with thiol groups involved in the regulation of signaling pathways. Particularly the combination of these multiple mechanisms may give rise to a high degree of genomic instability evident in cadmium-adapted cells, relevant not only for tumor initiation, but also for later steps in tumor development.",

The results indicate that the methanolic extract of oil fumes can apparently lead to cytotoxicity and oxidative DNA damage. Glutathione (GSH) content, and the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as GSH reductase, GSH peroxidase and GSH S-transferase were adversely reduced by the methanolic extract of oil fumes. t-t-2,4-DDE could produce superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and form intracellular ROS, determined by dichlorofluorescein assay in A-549 cells. Moreover, t-t-2,4-DDE caused significant (P <0.05) oxidative damage of the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine formation in A-549 cells at concentrations from 50 to 200 microM.

To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to investigate the combined effects of anticancer drugs and radiotherapy. In this study, to evaluate the role of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the radiation-induced cell death of tumor cells, we have examined the effect of 3-methyl pyruvate (MP). MP is a membrane-permeable pyruvate derivative that is capable of activating mitochondrial energy metabolism in human lung carcinoma A549 cells and murine squamous carcinoma SCCVII cells. Pretreatment with MP significantly enhanced radiation-induced cell death in both cell lines, and also led to increases in the mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria-derived ROS production following the exposure of the cells to X-rays. In A549 cells, MP-induced radiosensitization was completely abolished by vitamin C. In contrast, it was partially abolished in SCCVII cells. These results therefore suggest that the treatment of the cells with MP induced radiosensitization via the production of excess mitochondria-derived ROS in tumor cells. ",

It is now becoming clear that these ROS generated secondarily after Ir have a variety of biological roles. Although mitochondria are assumed to be responsible for this Ir-induced ROS production, it remains to be elucidated how Ir triggers it. Therefore, we conducted this study to decipher the mechanism of Ir-induced mitochondrial ROS production. In human lung carcinoma A549 cells, Ir (10 Gy of X-rays) induced a time-dependent increase in the mitochondrial ROS level. Ir also increased mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration, and mitochondrial ATP production, suggesting upregulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function after Ir. Although we found that Ir slightly enhanced mitochondrial ETC complex II activity, the complex II inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid failed to reduce Ir-induced mitochondrial ROS production. Meanwhile, we observed that the mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial DNA level were upregulated after Ir, indicating that Ir increased the mitochondrial content of the cell. Because irradiated cells are known to undergo cell cycle arrest under control of the checkpoint mechanisms, we examined the relationships between cell cycle and mitochondrial content and cellular oxidative stress level. We found that the cells in the G2/M phase had a higher mitochondrial content and cellular oxidative stress level than cells in the G1 or S phase, regardless of whether the cells were irradiated. We also found that Ir-induced accumulation of the cells in the G2/M phase led to an increase in cells with a high mitochondrial content and cellular oxidative stress level. This suggested that Ir upregulated mitochondrial ETC function and mitochondrial content, resulting in mitochondrial ROS production, and that Ir-induced G2/M arrest contributed to the increase in the mitochondrial ROS level by accumulating cells in the G2/M phase.",

In addition, the effect of P.g AgNPs on cell migration, apoptosis and the determination of the mechanism involve was determinate by the use of A549 lung cancer cell line.

Chronic inflammation has been linked to several human diseases and also to initiation and promotion of cancer. Generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), secretion of cytokines, chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors are believed to play a role. Interleukin IL-1beta, encoded by the IL1B gene, is a key cytokine produced and secreted by many cell types after activation by biological or chemical agents. Several polymorphisms in the IL1B gene have been identified, and some are associated with increased risk for lung cancer. Especially, the IL1B -31T/C polymorphism has received attention. We have investigated the effect of the lung carcinogens cigarette-smoke condensate (CSC) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) on the promoters of the IL1B gene varying only at the site of the -31T/C polymorphism. The promoter fragments containing either C or T were cloned in luciferase reporter vectors and transfected into human lung epithelial NCI-H2009 cells. The results show that treatment of the transfected cells with CSC or B[a]P induced the promoter significantly above the control level. Interestingly, the promoter with the wild-type allele T in position -31 showed the stronger induction when compared with the promoter with variant allele C in this position.

It has been shown that NQO1 is also essential for the TNF-induced activation of NF-kappaB and that beta-lap suppresses the TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. We investigated whether or not NQO1 is involved and beta-lap suppresses the radiation-induced NF-kappaB activation using A549 human lung cancer cells and NQO1-knock down A549 cells (shNQO1 A549 cells). Irradiation with 4 Gy markedly increased the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB in A549 cells, but not in the shNQO1 A549 cells, thus demonstrating that NQO1 plays a pivotal role in irradiation-induced NF-kappaB activation. Treatment with 10 micronM beta-lap for 4 h almost completely abrogated the radiation-induced increase in NF-kappaB activation and the transcription of NF-kappaB target genes such as bcl2, gadd45beta and cyclinD1. Moreover, beta-lap markedly suppressed the activation of IkappaB kinase gamma (IKKgamma) and the subsequent phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB activation. It is concluded that beta-lap suppresses the radiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB by interrupting the involvement of NQO1 in the activation of NF-kappaB, thereby inhibiting the transcription of survival signals. The radiosensitization caused by beta-lap may, in part, be attributed to beta-lap-induced suppression of NF-kappaB activation.",

Also, its expression is induced in response to a wide variety of stressors including cancer. Upregulation of CypA in small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma has been reported. In some cancers a correlation between CypA overexpression and malignant transformation has been established. While molecular partners of CypA that promote cancer development are yet to be discovered, various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the cytoprotective functions of CypA during cancer development. CypA may promote the survival of cells under the stressful condition of cancer. CypA may well be essential for maintaining the conformation of oncogenic proteins, signalling proteins for cell proliferation, antiapoptotic components, transcription factors, or cell motility regulatory proteins. Antioxidant effects of CypA, which have been suggested by some researchers, may also become critical to reactive oxygen species (ROS) creating an oncogenetic environment.

However, relationship between host Nrf2 and cancer metastasis remains unexplored. To address this issue, we examined susceptibility of Nrf2-deficient mice to pulmonary cancer metastasis following implantation of the mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) cell line. Nrf2-deficient mice reproducibly exhibited a higher number of pulmonary metastatic nodules than wild-type mice did. The lung and bone marrow (BM) of cancer-bearing Nrf2-deficient mice contained increased numbers of inflammatory cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a potent population of immunosuppressive cells. MDSCs can attenuate CD8(+) T-cell immunity through modification of the T-cell receptor complex exploiting reactive oxygen species (ROS). MDSCs of Nrf2-deficient mice retained elevated levels of ROS relative to wild-type mice. BM transplantation experiments revealed functional disturbance in the hematopoietic and immune systems of Nrf2-deficient mice. Wild-type recipient mice with Nrf2-deficient BM cells showed increased levels of lung metastasis after cancer cell inoculation. These mice exhibited high-level accumulation of ROS in MDSCs, which showed very good coincidence to the decrease of splenic CD8(+) T-cells. In contrast, Keap1-knockdown mutant mice harboring high-level Nrf2 expression displayed increased resistance against the cancer cell metastasis to the lung, accompanied by a decrease in ROS in the MDSCs fraction. Our results thus reveal a novel function for Nrf2 in the prevention of cancer metastasis, presumably by its ability to preserve the redox balance in the hematopoietic and immune systems.",

Both doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DNR) were accumulated to a lesser extent and effluxed at a higher rate by MDR cells than by their drug-sensitive counterparts. In contrast, the 9-alkyl substituted compound, aclacinomycin A (ACL), was accumulated and effluxed from parent and MDR cells at an identical rate. In experiments designed to examine energy-dependent efflux, DOX and DNR were shown to be efficiently effluxed against the concentration gradient in the presence of glucose. However, in the same experiments the analogues ACL and Ro 31-3294 (9-alkyl and morpholinyl substituted), which have previously been shown to retain activity against MDR cell lines, were accumulated and effluxed at identical rates in parent and MDR EMT6 cells. Hence, 9-alkyl and morpholinyl substituted compounds appear to behave less favourably as substrates for energy-driven drug efflux by Pgp-positive MDR cells than do DOX or DNR. Resistance modifiers verapamil and cyclosporin A appeared to abolish energy-dependent efflux for DOX and DNR in both the EMT6 and H69 MDR lines whereas they had no effect on the cellular efflux of ACL. The altered cellular pharmacology in MDR cell lines may provide a rational basis for the use of modified anthracycline analogues (e.g. 9-alkyl and morpholinyl (substituted) and resistance of modifying agent in the treatment of tumours expressing a Pgp-mediated phenotype.",

However, the prognostic value of DUOX1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma patients is still unclear. We investigated the prognostic value of DUOX1 expression in liver cancer patients. DUOX1 mRNA expression was determined in tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues by real‑time PCR. For evaluation of the prognostic value of DUOX1 expression, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards model (univariate analysis and multivariate analysis) were employed. A simple risk score was devised by using significant variables obtained from the Cox's regression analysis to further predict the HCC patient prognosis. We observed a reduced DUOX1 mRNA level in the cancer tissues in comparison to the non‑cancer tissues. More importantly, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high DUOX1 expression had longer disease-free survival and overall survival compared with those with low expression of DUOX1. Cox's regression analysis indicated that DUOX1 expression, age, and intrahepatic metastasis may be significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival and overall survival. Finally, we found that patients with total scores of >2 and >1 were more likely to relapse and succumb to the disease than patients whose total scores were ≤2 and ≤1. In conclusion, DUOX1 expression in liver tumors is a potential prognostic tool for patients. The risk scoring system is useful for predicting the survival of liver cancer patients after tumor resection. ",

However, when it becomes chronic, it can cause several pathologies such as cardiovascular, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's autoimmune diseases and cancer. Currently, epidemiological data indicate that over 25% of all cancers are related to chronic infections and other types of unresolved inflammation. Further evidence of this relationship is the fact that prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with reduced risk to developing many types of cancers. Some randomized trials have shown that NSAIDs have protective action against colon adenomas, breast, prostate, and lung cancers. The inflammation present on tumor microenvironment is characterized by leukocyte infiltration, ranging in size, distribution and composition, as: tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), mast cells, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes. These cells produce a variety of cytotoxic mediators such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS respectively), serine and cysteine proteases, membrane perforating agents, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8), interferons (IFNs) and enzymes, as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), lipooxygenase-5 (LOX-5) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which activate or are activated by transcription factors as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3). Initially this paper will briefly review the main mediators present on tumor microenvironment, addressing the cytokines, chemokines, transcription factors, eicosanoid, and kinins and later, will present an overview of the role of inflammation in the different steps of carcinogenesis.",

Despite a dramatic reduction in asbestos use worldwide, asbestos-induced lung diseases remain a substantial health concern primarily because of the vast amounts of fibers that have been mined, processed, and used during the 20th century combined with the long latency period of up to 40 years between exposure and disease presentation. This review summarizes the important new epidemiologic and pathogenic information that has emerged over the past several years. Whereas the development of asbestosis is directly associated with the magnitude and duration of asbestos exposure, the development of a malignant clone of cells can occur in the setting of low-level asbestos exposure. Emphasis is placed on the recent epidemiologic investigations that explore the malignancy risk that occurs from nonoccupational, environmental asbestos exposure. Accumulating studies are shedding light on novel mechanistic pathways by which asbestos damages the lung. Attention is focused on the importance of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury and repair, the role of iron-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis by the p53- and mitochondria-regulated death pathways. Furthermore, recent evidence underscores crucial roles for specific cellular signaling pathways that regulate the production of cytokines and growth factors. An evolving role for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is also reviewed. The translational significance of these studies is evident in providing the molecular basis for developing novel therapeutic strategies for asbestos-related lung diseases and, importantly, other pulmonary diseases, such as interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anthracyclines possessing either a 9-alkyl modification in the A-ring of the tetracyclic aglycone and/or specific changes to the amino sugar moiety retain effective cytotoxic activity against multidrug resistant (MDR) cell lines. To obtain a better understanding of the structural features responsible for this potentially valuable behaviour, we used the MTT tetrazolium dye reduction assay to calculate resistance factors (RF = the ratio of ID50 for the drug-resistant line to that for the parental line) for the EMT6/P mouse mammary tumour and its MDR variant EMT6/AR1.0, and the H69/P human small cell lung cancer line and its MDR counterpart H69/LX4. Both MDR lines exhibit marked resistance to doxorubicin, MDR 1 gene amplification, hyperexpression of the membrane P-glycoprotein and reduced drug accumulation. RF values for doxorubicin were 34 and 131 in the EMT6 and H69 cell line pairs, respectively. The 9-alkyl-substituted anthracyclines were confirmed as having RF values 9- to 15-fold lower than those for doxorubicin. The 9-ethyl analogues Ro 31-1966 (RF for EMT6 2.2, RF for H69 4.7) and Ro 31-1749 (RF for EMT6 3.9, RF for H69 9.5) were superior to the previously studied 9-methyl analogue Ro 31-1215 (RF for EMT6 8.1 RF for H69 12.4). A clear trend for RF values to decrease with increasing 9-alkyl chain length was also noted in the structurally more complex aclacinomycin series. For example, 13-methyl-aclacinomycin (RF for EMT6 1.0, RF for H69 2.2) featuring a 9-isopropyl moiety was superior to the 9-alkyl-containing aclacinomycin A (RF for EMT6 4.7, RF for H69 5.8), and this was in turn more effective than the 9-methyl analogue sulfurmycin A (RF for EMT6 6.4, RF for H69 14.2). The trisaccharide moiety was not an essential feature for activity against MDR lines in the aclacinomycins, as shown by the low RF value with aklavine (RF for EMT6 2.1, RF for H69 2.5). However, a small change in one of the sugar moieties of aclacinomycin A, as in marcellomycin, resulted in a considerable increase in RF values (RF for EMT6 18.5, RF for H69 25.3). The complex anthracyclines AD 32 (RF for EMT6 6.5, RF for H69 11.7) and particularly tetrahydropyranyl-doxorubicin (RF for EMT6 1.4, RF for H69 3.2) were effective against MDR lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Although only 2 years have passed many new facts and stimulating developments have happened in diagnostic molecular pathology rendering it worthwhile to present an up-date on this topic. A major technical improvement is certainly given by the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS; amplicon, whole exome, whole genome) and its application to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in routine diagnostics. Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs. In the near future this will open new strategies to apply 'off-label' targeted therapies, e.g. for rare tumors, otherwise resistant tumors etc. The clinically relevant genetic aberrations described in this review include mutation analyses of RAS (KRAS and NRAS), BRAF and PI3K in colorectal cancer, KIT or PDGFR alpha as well as BRAF, NRAS and KIT in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we present several recent advances in the molecular characterization of malignant lymphoma. Beside the well-known mutations in NSCLC (EGFR, ALK) a number of chromosomal aberrations (KRAS, ROS1, MET) have become relevant. Only very recently has the clinical need for analysis of BRCA1/2 come up and proven as a true challenge for routine diagnostics because of the genes' special structure and hot-spot-free mutational distribution. The genetic alterations are discussed in connection with their increasingly important role in companion diagnostics to apply targeted drugs as efficient as possible. As another aspect of the increasing number of druggable mutations, we discuss the challenges personalized therapies pose for the design of clinical studies to prove optimal efficacy particularly with respect to combination therapies of multiple targeted drugs and conventional chemotherapy. Such combinations would lead to an extremely high complexity that would hardly be manageable by applying conventional study designs for approval, e.g. by the FDA or EMA. Up-coming challenges such as the application of methylation assays and proteomic analyses on FFPE tissue will also be discussed briefly to open the door towards the ultimate goal of reading a patients' tissue as 'deeply' as possible. Although it is yet to be shown, which levels of biological information are most informative for predictive pathology, an integrated molecular characterization of tumors will likely offer the most comprehensive view for individualized therapy approaches. To optimize cancer treatment we need to understand tumor biology in much more detail on morphological, genetic, proteomic as well as epigenetic grounds. Finally, the complex challenges on the level of drug design, molecular diagnostics, and clinical trials make necessary a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies.

A fluorescence assay indicated that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were markedly provoked by compound 1 treatment compared to control cells. Immunoblot results showed that compound 1 significantly increased the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, P53 and Bax protein, and decreased the expression level of Bcl-2 protein.

The large toad Rhinella marina is common in the cleared tropical forests of the Iquitos region and is regarded as poisonous. The venom from two different populations of R. marina was collected in the Departamento de Loreto, Perú. The samples were assessed for antiproliferative effect and composition. Some 29 compounds were identified or tentatively identified from the venom by spectroscopic and spectrometric means. The main free bufadienolide was marinobufagin 7 while marinobufotoxin 15 and bufalitoxin 9 were the main bufadienolide argininyl diacid derivatives. The alkaloids dehydrobufotenin 28 and bufotenidin 29 were present in both venoms. The main difference in the venoms was the relative ratio of argininyl diacids from bufadienolides to free bufadienolides. The argininyl diacids included derivatives from bufalin, marinobufagin, telocinobufagin, hellebrigenin, resibufogenin and bufotalinin. Four compounds, including undecadienoyl aginine 6 and three argininyl diacids from bufadienolides were tentatively identified for the first time in the samples. The venom showed a strong antiproliferative effect towards MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts (0.063-0.247 μg/mL), AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (0.076-0.272 μg/mL), SK-MES-1 human lung cancer cells (0.154-0.296 μg/mL), J82 human bladder carcinoma cells (0.169-0.212 μg/mL), and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia (0.071-0.283 μg/mL). The antiproliferative effect is mediated by ROS production and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231).

The treatment was administered for 1 year except when progression of disease occurred. The primary study endpoints were to define clinical outcome, i.e. duration of response, survival (overall survival, OS and progression-free survival, PFS), the toxicity profile, and the evaluation of quality of life (QL). As secondary endpoints, we measured the changes of lymphocyte count, serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-2, C-reactive protein (CRP) and leptin, blood levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, GPx and superoxide dismertase, SOD). From July 1998 to June 2003, 42 patients were enrolled in the study (M/F ratio, 39/3; mean age, 62.5 years). Twenty (47.6%) patients were elderly (> 65 years). The majority of patients had either head and neck cancer or lung cancer, 88% had locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis, and 76% had ECOG 0. Forty patients were previously treated with chemotherapy (27 also with radiotherapy), two with IL-2 and interfiron (IFN), one with endocrine therapy and one with only surgery. We obtained an objective response to maintenance treatment of 50%. Median duration of response was 19 months and median PFS was 33 months. Median duration of maintenance treatment was 12 months, median follow-up duration from diagnosis to June 2003 was 40 months, and median follow-up duration from study entry to June 2003 was 17 months. The median overall survival has not been reached. Toxicity was negligible. As for QL, a significant improvement of cognitive functions was observed, whereas all other functioning and symptom scales did not change significantly. As for laboratory parameters, absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly, IL-6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CRP, and fibrinogen decreased significantly whereas IL-2 and leptin increased significantly after treatment. ROS decreased significantly, whereas GPx increased significantly after treatment. Patients alive at study end showed a significant increase in absolute lymphocyte count, IL-2, leptin, and GPx and a significant decrease of proinflammatory cytokines, CRP, fibrinogen, and ROS, whereas patients who died before study end exhibited only a significant increase in absolute lymphocyte count, IL-2, and GPx and a significant decrease of ROS.

        "Doc_abstract":"An association between exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) and increased incidence of mortality and morbidity due to lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases has been demonstrated by recent epidemiological studies. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydroxyl radicals, generated by PM, have been suggested by many studies as an important factor in the oxidative damage of DNA by PM. The purpose of this study was to characterize quantitatively hydroxyl radical generation by various transition metals in the presence of H2O2 in aqueous buffer solution (pH 7.4) and hydroxylation of 2'-deoxyguanosine (dG) to 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) under similar conditions. The order of metals' redox reactivity and hydroxyl radical production was Fe(II), V(IV), Cu(I), Cr(III), Ni(II), Co(II), Pb(II), Cd(II). Then, we investigated the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the presence of H2O2 by various airborne PM samples, such as total suspended particulate (TSP), PM10, PM2.5 (PM with aerodynamic diameter 10 and 2.5 microm), diesel exhaust particles (DEP), gasoline exhaust particles (GEP) and woodsmoke soot under the same conditions. When suspensions of PMs were incubated with H2O2 and dG at pH 7.4, all particles induced hydroxylation of dG and formation of 8-OHdG in a dose-dependent increase. Our findings demonstrated that PM's hydroxyl radical (HO radical) generating ability and subsequent dG hydroxylation is associated with the concentration of water-soluble metals, especially Fe and V and other redox or ionizable transition metals and not their total metal content, or insoluble metal oxides, via a Fenton-driven reaction of H2O2 with metals. Additionally, we observed, by Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), that PM suspensions in the presence of H2O2 generated radical species with dG, which were spin-trapped by 2-methyl-2-nitroso-propane (MNP).",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease manifested by significantly impaired airflow, afflicts ∼14.2 million cases in the United States alone with an estimated 63 million people world-wide. Although there are a number of causes, the predominant cause is excessive tobacco smoke. In fact, in China, there have been estimates of 315,000,000 people that smoke. Other less frequent causes are associated with indirect cigarette smoke, air pollutants, biomass fuels, and genetic mutations. COPD is often associated with heart disease, lung cancer, osteoporosis and conditions can worsen in patients with sudden falls. COPD also affects both innate and adaptive immune processes. Cigarette smoke increases the expression of matrix metalloproteases and proinflammatory chemokines and increases lung titers of natural killer cells and neutrophils. Yet, neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by the phagocytic respiratory burst and phagocytosis is impaired by nicotine. In contrast to innate immunity in COPD, dendritic cells represent leukocytes recruited to the lung that link the innate immune responses to adaptive immune responses by activating naïve T cells through antigen presentation. The autoimmune process that is also a significant part of inflammation associated with COPD. Moreover, coupled with restricted FEV1 values, are the prevalence of patients with single or multiple infections by bacteria, viruses and fungi. Finally, we focus on one of the more problematic infectious agents, the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Specifically, we delve into the development of highly problematic biofilm infections that are highly refractory to conventional antibiotic therapies in COPD. We offer a non-conventional, biocidal treatment that may be effective for COPD airway infections as well as with combinations of current antibiotic regimens for more effective treatment outcomes and relief for patients with COPD.

The most common clinical manifestations in patients with G6PD deficiency are neonatal jaundice and acute hemolytic anemia. The effects of microbial infection in patients with G6PD deficiency primarily relate to the hemolytic anemia caused by Plasmodium or viral infections and the subsequent medication that is required. We are interested in studying the impact of bacterial infection in G6PD-deficient cells. G6PD knock down A549 lung carcinoma cells, together with the common pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, were employed in our cell infection model. Here, we demonstrate that a lower cell viability was observed among G6PD-deficient cells when compared to scramble controls upon bacterial infection using the MTT assay. A significant increase in the intracellular ROS was detected among S. aureus-infected G6PD-deficient cells by observing dichlorofluorescein (DCF) intensity within cells under a fluorescence microscope and quantifying this signal using flow cytometry. The impairment of ROS removal is predicted to enhance apoptotic activity in G6PD-deficient cells, and this enhanced apoptosis was observed by annexin V/PI staining under a confocal fluorescence microscope and quantified by flow cytometry. A higher expression level of the intrinsic apoptotic initiator caspase-9, as well as the downstream effector caspase-3, was detected by Western blotting analysis of G6PD-deficient cells following bacterial infection. In conclusion, we propose that bacterial infection, perhaps the secreted S. aureus α-hemolysin in this case, promotes the accumulation of intracellular ROS in G6PD-deficient cells. This would trigger a stronger apoptotic activity through the intrinsic pathway thereby reducing cell viability when compared to wild type cells. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"In mammalian species, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with pathogenic mutations that induce mitochondrial respiration defects has been proposed to be involved in tumor phenotypes via induction of enhanced glycolysis under normoxic conditions (the Warburg effects). However, because both nuclear DNA and mtDNA control mitochondrial respiratory function, it is difficult to exclude the possible contribution of nuclear DNA mutations to mitochondrial respiration defects and the resultant expression of tumor phenotypes. Therefore, it is important to generate transmitochondrial cybrids sharing the same nuclear DNA background but carrying mtDNA with and without the mutations by using intercellular mtDNA transfer technology. Our previous studies isolated transmitochondrial cybrids and showed that specific mtDNA mutations enhanced tumor progression as a consequence of overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study assessed whether mtDNA mutations inducing ROS overproduction always enhance tumor progression. We introduced mtDNA from senescence-accelerated mice P1 (SAMP1) into C57BL/6J (B6) mice-derived Lewis lung carcinoma P29 cells, and isolated new transmitochondrial cybrids (P29mtSAMP1 cybrids) that overproduced ROS. The inoculation of the cybrids into B6 mice unexpectedly showed that mtDNA from SAMP1 mice conversely induced tumor suppression. Moreover, the tumor suppression of P29mtSAMP1 cybrids in B6 mice occurred as a consequence of innate immune responses of the host B6 mice. Enzyme pretreatment experiments of P29mtSAMP1 cybrids revealed that some peptides encoded by mtDNA and expressed on the cell surface of P29mtSAMP1 cybrids induce increased IL-6 production from innate immune cells (dendritic cells) of B6 mice, and mediate augmented inflammatory responses around the tumor-inoculated environment. These observations indicate presence of a novel role of mtDNA in tumor phenotype, and provide new insights into the fields of mitochondrial tumor biology and tumor immunology. ",

Human lung carcinoma cells (ATCC line H441) having epithelial characteristics (including lamellar bodies, surfactant protein [SP]-A, and SP-B) were cultured in air (air/5% CO(2)) or hypoxia (< 1% O(2)/5% CO(2)) for 0 to 24 hours before imposition of oxidant stress. Cellular manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity (units/mg protein) decreased significantly after 24 hours of hypoxia. In normoxic culture after hypoxia, the cells produced increased ROS, detected as dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence and H(2)O(2) accumulation in medium. Antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac) and ebselen inhibited increased DCF fluorescence after hypoxia. To test their ability to tolerate oxidant stress, some cells were incubated with antimycin A (100 microM) and trifluorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (10 microM) (anti A + FCCP), a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor and respiratory chain uncoupler, which together increase mitochondrial superoxide (O(2)(-)) and H(2)O(2) production. Lung epithelial cells preexposed to hypoxia released more lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) than normoxic controls in response to increased O(2)(-) production. Increased LDH release from hypoxia-preexposed cells treated with anti A + FCCP was inhibited by 1 mM N-Ac. Rotenone and myxothiazole increased DCF oxidation more in hypoxic than in normoxic cells, suggesting that mitochondrial electron transport complex I may have been altered by hypoxia preexposure.",

In this study we observed that alpha-hederin caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis of murine leukemia P388 cells. In order to evaluate the possible mechanisms for apoptosis, the effects of alpha-hederin on intracellular thiol concentration, including reduced glutathione (GSH), and protein thiols, and the effects of pretreatment with N-acetlycysteine (NAC), a precursor of intracellular GSH synthesis, or buthionine sulfoxime (BSO), a specific inhibitor of intracellular GSH synthesis, on alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis were investigated. It was found that alpha-hederin rapidly depleted intracellular GSH and protein thiols prior to the occurrence of apoptosis. NAC significantly alleviated alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis, while BSO augmented alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis significantly. The depletion of cellular thiols observed after alpha-hederin treatment caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) and subsequently increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in P388 cells at an early time point. Bongkrekic acid (BA), a ligand of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator, and cyclosporin (CsA) attenuated the alpha-hederin-induced loss of deltapsi(m), and ROS production. Thus, oxidative stress after alpha-hederin treatment is an important event in alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis. As observed in this study, permeability transition of mitochondrial membrane occurs after depletion of GSH and precedes a state of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, we observed that alpha-hederin caused the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol, leading to caspase-3 activation. Our findings thus demonstrate that changes in intracellular thiols and redox status leading to perturbance of mitochondrial functions are important components in the mechanism of alpha-hederin-induced cell death.",

The SiO2 particles were dispersed in culture medium and applied to HaCaT human keratinocytes and A549 human lung carcinoma cells. nSiO2s showed stronger protein adsorption than larger SiO2 particles. Moreover, the cellular effects of SiO2 particles were independent of the particle size and crystalline phase. The extent of cell membrane damage and intracellular ROS levels were different among nSiO2s. Upon exposure to nSiO2s, some cells released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), whereas another nSiO2 did not induce LDH release. nSiO2s caused a slight increase in intracellular ROS levels. These cellular effects were independent of the specific surface area and primary particle size of the nSiO2s. Additionally, association of solubility and protein adsorption ability of nSiO2 to its cellular effects seemed to be small. Taken together, our data suggest that nSiO2s do not exert potent cytotoxic effects on cells in culture, especially compared to the effects of micro-scale SiO2 particles.

Four of the smoke induced genes are aldo-keto reductases (AKR), enzymes that metabolically activate PAH to PAH o-quinones. Alternatively, PAHs are metabolized to (±)-anti-diol epoxides, such as (±)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide ((±)-anti-BPDE)), by the combined action of P4501A1/1B1 and epoxide hydrolase. (±)-anti-BPDE forms DNA adducts directly, while PAH o-quinones cause DNA damage by oxidative stress through a futile redox cycle. To address the role of AKRs in PAH cytotoxicity, we compared the cytotoxicity of PAH metabolites and the effects of overexpressing AKR1A1 in lung cells. (±)-anti-BPDE and B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol, an intermediate in (±)-anti-BPDE metabolism, are toxic to A549 cells at concentrations with an IC(50) of ∼2 μM. In contrast, the PAH o-quinone B[a]P-7,8-dione was about 10-fold less toxic to A549 cells with an IC(50) > 20 μM. Similar differences in cytoxicity were observed with two other PAH o-quinones (benz[a]anthracene-3,4-dione and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-dione) compared with their respective diol-epoxide counterparts (BA-3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide and DMBA-3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide). In addition, both anti-BPDE and B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol induced p53 expression ∼6 h post-treatment at concentrations as low as 1 μM consistent with extensive DNA damage. B[a]P-7,8-dione treatment did not induce p53 but generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A549 cells and induced the expression of oxidative response genes in H358 cells. We also observed that overexpression of AKR1A1 in H358 cells, which otherwise have low levels of AKR expression, protected cells 2-10-fold from the toxic effects of B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol.

Autophagosomes have been detected upon Brevinin-2R treatment. Our results show that Brevinin-2R activates the lysosomalmitochondrial death pathway, and involves autophagy-like cell death.",

To investigate whether exposure to a proton beam can overcome radioresistance in hypoxic tumor cells, three kinds of cancer cells, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, hepatoma HepG2 and Molt-4 leukemia cells, were treated with a proton beam (35 MeV, 1, 2, 5, 10 Gy) in the presence or absence of hypoxia. Cell death rates were determined 72 h after irradiation. Hypoxic cells exposed to the proton beam underwent a typical apoptotic program, showing condensed nuclei, fragmented DNA ladders, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed a significant increase in Annexin-V-positive cells. Cells treated with the proton beam and hypoxia displayed increased expression of p53, p21 and Bax, but decreased levels of phospho-Rb, Bcl-2 and XIAP, as well as activated caspase-9 and -3. The proton beam with hypoxia induced cell death in wild-type HCT116 cells, but not in a p53 knockout cell line, demonstrating a requirement for p53. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also significantly increased, apoptosis could also be abolished by treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated by the treatment, and their respective DN mutants restored the cell death induced by either proton therapy alone or with hypoxia. In conclusion, proton beam treatment did not differently regulate cancer cell apoptosis either in normoxic or hypoxic conditions via a p53-dependent mechanism and by the activation of p38/JNK MAPK pathways through ROS.",

Exposure to MEMC was found to result in growth inhibition by the induction             of caspase‑dependent apoptosis in NCI-H460 cells, which correlated with upregulated             expression of death receptor (DR)4, DR5 and FasL, downregulation of anti-apoptotic             Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, cleavage of Bid, and loss of mitochondrial membrane             potential.

In tumor-bearing mice, low-dose simvastatin (0.2 mg/kg) induced upregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) skewed vessels to a pericyte-coated and stable pattern, while high-dose simvastatin (10 mg/kg) remarkably deceased reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, attenuating VEGF-drived tumor vessel hyperpermeability. These changes ultimately improved intratumoral perfusion and decreased tumor hypoxia. Administration of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide to the simvastatin-treated mice resulted in slower tumor growth.

This protective program has been shown to reduce carcinogenesis triggered by chemical and physical insults. However, it is also hijacked by established cancers to thrive and proliferate within the hostile tumor microenvironment and to gain resistance against chemo- and radiotherapies. Therefore, targeting the AOS response proteins that are exploited by cancer cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy. In order to identify the AOS genes that are suspected to support cancer progression and resistance, we analyzed the expression patterns of 285 genes annotated for being involved in oxidative stress in 994 tumors and 353 normal tissues. Thereby we identified a signature of 116 genes that are highly overexpressed in multiple carcinomas while being only minimally expressed in normal tissues. To establish which of these genes are more likely to functionally drive cancer resistance and progression, we further identified those whose overexpression correlates with negative patient outcome in breast and lung carcinoma. Gene-set enrichment, GO, network, and pathway analyses revealed that members of the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways are prominent components of this oncogenic signature and that activation of these pathways is common feature of many cancer entities. Interestingly, a large fraction of these AOS genes are downstream targets of the transcription factors NRF2, NF-kappaB and FOXM1, and relay on NADPH for their enzymatic activities highlighting promising drug targets. We discuss these findings and propose therapeutic strategies that may be applied to overcome cancer resistance. ",

Furthermore, we evaluated the multidimensional effect of the biologically synthesized AgNPs in Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter felis, and human lung (L132) and lung carcinoma (A549) cells. UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that the AgNPs are specifically indexed to a crystal structure. The results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicate that biomolecules are involved in the synthesis and stabilization of AgNPs. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies showed the average size distribution of the particle between 10 and 40 nm, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that the AgNPs were significantly well separated and spherical with an average size of 20 nm. AgNPs caused dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and biofilm formation and increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA fragmentation in H. pylori and H. felis. Furthermore, AgNPs induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in A549 cells; conversely, AgNPs had no significant effects on L132 cells. The results from this study suggest that AgNPs could cause cell-specific apoptosis in mammalian cells. Our findings demonstrate that this environmentally friendly method for the synthesis of AgNPs and that the prepared AgNPs have multidimensional effects such as anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activity against H. pylori and H. felis and also cytotoxic effects against human cancer cells.

Although conventional in vitro cytotoxicological techniques provide valuable information about the particle toxicity, the importance of gaining high content information in a single assay with the analysis of multiple parameters in a non-invasive and label-free way is still one of the biggest challenges in nanotoxicology. As a vibrational spectroscopic technique, the power of Raman spectroscopy for the analysis of cells, tissues and also nanoparticle localization within cells has been shown previously. In this study, the ability of Raman spectroscopy to fingerprint the dose and time dependent cellular responses and effect of cytotoxic events on biochemical constituents of the cells is monitored. A549 human lung carcinoma cells and aminated polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NH2) are used as a model cell line and nanoparticle, respectively. Following the determination of cellular responses in the presence of toxic PS-NH2 by using conventional cellular assays, Alamar Blue (AB) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromid (MTT), and calculation of EC50 values for both assays, Raman spectroscopy was employed at response related doses and time points. Multiple point spectra from the cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus of 20 cells were acquired using Raman spectroscopy for each exposure dose and timepoint. Unsupervised principle components analysis (PCA) was applied to the Raman data sets for the comparison of exposed and unexposed cells as well as different exposure doses and times. The study shows the ability of Raman spectroscopy to provide information about cellular responses at different particle concentrations and exposure times with the aid of multivariate analysis. In the chosen range of concentrations, the most significant changes were observed in the cytoplasm for both time dependent and dose dependent cases due to the route of endocytosis. The Raman spectral markers for lipidosis, ROS formation and oxidative stress related biochemical damage are determined and correlated with exposure dose and time, and the responses are correlated with conventional cytotoxicity assays.

        "Doc_abstract":"The hypoxic areas of solid cancers represent a negative prognostic factor irrespective of which treatment modality is chosen for the patient. Still, after almost 80 years of focus on the problems created by hypoxia in solid tumours, we still largely lack methods to deal efficiently with these treatment-resistant cells. The consequences of this lack may be serious for many patients: Not only is there a negative correlation between the hypoxic fraction in tumours and the outcome of radiotherapy as well as many types of chemotherapy, a correlation has been shown between the hypoxic fraction in tumours and cancer metastasis. Thus, on a fundamental basis the great variety of problems related to hypoxia in cancer treatment has to do with the broad range of functions oxygen (and lack of oxygen) have in cells and tissues. Therefore, activation-deactivation of oxygen-regulated cascades related to metabolism or external signalling are important areas for the identification of mechanisms as potential targets for hypoxia-specific treatment. Also the chemistry related to reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) and the biological handling of ROS are part of the problem complex. The problem is further complicated by the great variety in oxygen concentrations found in tissues. For tumour hypoxia to be used as a marker for individualisation of treatment there is a need for non-invasive methods to measure oxygen routinely in patient tumours. A large-scale collaborative EU-financed project 2009-2014 denoted METOXIA has studied all the mentioned aspects of hypoxia with the aim of selecting potential targets for new hypoxia-specific therapy and develop the first stage of tests for this therapy. A new non-invasive PET-imaging method based on the 2-nitroimidazole [(18)F]-HX4 was found to be promising in a clinical trial on NSCLC patients. New preclinical models for testing of the metastatic potential of cells were developed, both in vitro (2D as well as 3D models) and in mice (orthotopic grafting). Low density quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based assays were developed measuring multiple hypoxia-responsive markers in parallel to identify tumour hypoxia-related patterns of gene expression. As possible targets for new therapy two main regulatory cascades were prioritised: The hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF)-regulated cascades operating at moderate to weak hypoxia (<1% O(2)), and the unfolded protein response (UPR) activated by endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress and operating at more severe hypoxia (<0.2%). The prioritised targets were the HIF-regulated proteins carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), the lactate transporter MCT4 and the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4-arm of the UPR. The METOXIA project has developed patented compounds targeting CAIX with a preclinical documented effect. Since hypoxia-specific treatments alone are not curative they will have to be combined with traditional anti-cancer therapy to eradicate the aerobic cancer cell population as well.",
