Patients received imatinib 400 mg once per day or 400 mg twice per day if there was no initial response. Dose reductions were permitted for treatment-related toxicities. Additional oncogene mutation screening was performed by mass spectroscopy.;Twenty-five patients were enrolled (24 evaluable). Eight patients (33%) had tumors with KIT mutations, 11 (46%) with KIT amplifications, and five (21%) with both. Median follow-up was 10.6 months (range, 3.7 to 27.1 months). Best overall response rate (BORR) was 29% (21% excluding nonconfirmed responses) with a two-stage 95% CI of 13% to 51%. BORR was significantly greater than the hypothesized null of 5% and statistically significantly different by mutation status (7 of 13 or 54% KIT mutated v 0% KIT amplified only). There were no statistical differences in rates of progression or survival by mutation status or by melanoma site. The overall disease control rate was 50% but varied significantly by KIT mutation status (77% mutated v 18% amplified). Four patients harbored pretreatment NRAS mutations, and one patient acquired increased KIT amplification after treatment.;Melanomas that arise on mucosal, acral, or CSD skin should be assessed for KIT mutations. Imatinib can be effective when tumors harbor KIT mutations, but not if KIT is amplified only. NRAS mutations and KIT copy number gain may be mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to imatinib.",

We evaluated the anti-tumor activity and safety of nilotinib, a KIT inhibitor, in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT alterations, either mutations or amplifications.;This study was open-label, single center, prospective phase II clinical trial. Between October 2009 and April 2011, 11 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT gene mutations or KIT gene amplifications were enrolled in the first stage of phase II study and nilotinib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoint was response rate and secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).;Of 11 patients, 9 patients were evaluable for treatment response. Of 9 patients, three patients had KIT mutations in exon 11, Leu576Pro, Val559Ala and Lys558Arg; and 6 patients had KIT amplifications > 50 copies compared to control DNA. Two patients achieved partial response (22.2%) and 5 patients achieved stable disease (55.6%). In two patients who responded to nilotinib, both had KIT mutations and showed durable response for 8.4 months and 10.0+ months. Of note, one patient with KIT amplification had stable disease with response for 6 months. A decrease in tumor size from baseline was observed in four patients (44.4%). Nilotinib 800 mg/d was very well tolerated with grade 1 nausea and grade 1 dry-eye being the most common adverse events.;We have decided to publish the preliminary results because anti-tumor activity of nilotinib was promising in KIT mutated patients. Although our results are preliminary, nilotinib had very favorable toxicity profile with durable response in metastatic melanoma patients with KIT mutations. The anti-tumor activity of nilotinib in melanoma patients with KIT amplification is yet to be determined in future studies.

We sought to determine the association of increased copy numbers of GAB2 among melanoma subtypes in the context of genetic alterations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;A total of 85 melanomas arising from sun-protected (n = 23) and sun-exposed sites (n = 62) were analyzed for copy number changes using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and for gain-of-function mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;GAB2 amplifications were found in 9% of the cases and were associated with melanomas arising from acral and mucosal sites (P = 0.005). Increased copy numbers of the KIT locus were observed in 6% of the cases. The overall mutation frequencies for BRAF and NRAS were 43.5% and 14%, respectively, and were mutually exclusive. Among the acral and mucosal melanomas studied, the genetic alteration frequency was 26% for GAB2, 13% for KIT, 30% for BRAF, and 4% for NRAS. Importantly, the majority of GAB2 amplifications occurred independent from genetic events in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;GAB2 amplification is critical for melanomas arising from sun-protected sites.

We therefore examined the expression and mutations of KIT in 4 primary and 24 metastatic acral and mucosal melanomas. Immunohistochemistry revealed moderate or strong KIT protein expression in 13 (48%) tumors. Sequence analysis revealed K642E and D820Y mutations in two metastases. Amplification of KIT was identified by real-time PCR in 4 tumors, including one that had K642E. Western blot analysis showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor in 8 (62%) of 13 cryopreserved samples, indicating the frequent pathological activation of the receptor in vivo. Phosphorylation of KIT protein was detected in 2 tumors harboring KIT mutations, as well as in one tumor with KIT gene amplification. Furthermore, 5 tumors without detectable KIT gene aberrations showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in melanoma cells as well as stromal cells suggests SCF/KIT autocrine and paracrine activation in these tumors. Finally, we found significant growth suppressive effects of sunitinib in two acral melanoma cell lines; one harboring the D820Y mutation and one showing SCF-dependent KIT activation.

Because the activating mutations are dominant, it has been assumed that they are heterozygous in the affected tumors. To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing electropherograms on 43 BRAF mutation-positive and 3 c-kit mutation-positive malignant melanomas to determine the ratio of the normal to mutant allele. Of the 43 BRAF mutation-positive tumors, we classified 26 as presumptive heterozygous. Eight cases were indeterminate. Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the mutant allele. BRAF fluorescence in situ hybridization on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the mutant BRAF allele was due to amplification (2 cases) or chromosome 7 polysomy (7 cases). We have previously described the presence of the c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, in 2 of 100 malignant melanomas. In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the L576P mutation. Evaluation of the DNA sequencing electropherograms from all 3 cases of L576P mutation-positive melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal allele. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-kit on these 3 L576P mutation-positive tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the c-kit gene and the other 2 were present in a nonamplified diploid state.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanomas make up a heterogeneous group of tumors characterized by particular genetic aberrations depending on their anatomic localization and UV exposure. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is found in the majority of melanomas, with either somatic missense mutations of BRAF or, considerably more rarely, mutations of N-RAS. The loss of both products of the CDKN2A gene, proteins p16(ARF) and p14(INK4a), or amplification of microphthalmia-associated transcriptional factor (MITF) are also predisposing factors in the development of melanoma. BRAF mutations are observed mainly in melanomas on skin liable to intermittent UV exposure. Acral and mucosal melanomas, and also melanomas on skin damaged by chronic exposure to the sun are characterized by distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations with frequent amplifications and alterations of the KIT gene, while BRAF mutations are rarely found in these sites. Uveal melanomas show recurrent chromosomal losses (1p, 3, 6q) and gains (6p, 8q), but mutations of BRAF are hardly ever found. So far, ancillary molecular studies are not regularly applied in the routine diagnostic procedures performed when malignant melanoma is suspected. In the future, however, the development of targeted molecular therapies will require that molecular pathological techniques are used to identify the melanoma patients who will most probably benefit from a particular therapy.",

It was recently reported that gain-of-function KIT mutations and/or copy number increases are more common in mucosal and acral melanomas. Thus, we studied the frequency and pattern of KIT aberrations in mucosal and acral melanomas in Korea. We analyzed 97 patients who were pathologically confirmed with mucosal or acral melanoma between 1997 and 2010 at Samsung Medical Center. Of the 97 melanoma patients, 92 were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13, 17, and 18, BRAF and NRAS genes. KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative, real-time PCR. Of the 97 patients, 55 (56.7%) were mucosal, 40 (41.2%) were acral melanoma, and two were of unknown primary origin. Among seven cases with KIT mutation, five (60.0%) occurred in exon 11, one (20.0%) in exon 17, and one (20.0%) in exon 13. Point mutations were the most common, resulting in substitutions in exon 11 (K558R, T574A, L576P, and V559A), exon 13 (N655K), and exon 17 (N822K). A novel Thr574Ala (c.1720A>G) KIT mutation, which has not been reported in melanoma or other tumor types, was identified in one genital melanoma case. Of the 97 mucosal or acral melanoma specimens, 49 were tested for KIT gene copy number changes using quantitative PCR. Increased KIT copy number was identified in 15 patients: seven (40%) of 20 acral melanomas and eight (31%) of 26 mucosal melanomas. Our study implicates that a significant proportion of acral and mucosal melanomas have KIT mutations in Asian population.",

Detailed histological (biopsy and post-mortem) studies, tissue culture, and high-resolution cytogenetic analysis, including chromosome and array comparative genomic hybridization, Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel, and Sanger sequencing, were performed on tissues from a white male who succumbed at 17 months of age to congenital melanoma associated with a bathing-trunk nevus. We also used quantitative PCR to quantitatively assess the expression of NRAS among normal cells, including fibroblast and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells from our patient. Full autopsy documented tumors in the brain, spinal cord, lung, liver, testis, bone marrow, and, retrospectively, in the placenta. Next-generation sequencing and chromosome microarray in our patient revealed novel findings, including duplication of a mutated NRAS gene, leading to an aggressive clinical course and disseminated disease. Quantitative PCR showed a five-fold increase in NRAS expression in the melanoma cell line when compared with normal melanocytes. Finally, three amino acid-changing germline variants were detected: homozygous TP53 p.P72R, heterozygous KIT p.M541L, and homozygous KDR (VEGFR2) p.Q472H. These genes are involved in malignancy and other potentially relevant pathways, such as mast cell and melanocytic signaling, as well as angiogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into the biology of congenital melanocytic proliferations, showing that amplification of mutated NRAS seems to represent a new genetic mechanism leading to melanoma in the context of neurocutaneous melanocytosis.

However, melanoma tissue is often rich in melanin that co-purifies with DNA/RNA and inhibits subsequent PCR reactions, hampering tumor antigen detection and amplification. This problem has not yet been addressed systematically. Here we generated a photometric protocol to determine both the melanin and RNA concentration by correcting the latter for the absorption coefficient of melanin at 260 nm. Subsequently, different combinations of silica-based RNA-binding, size-exclusion, and ion-exchange columns were used in 8 protocols for isolation of RNA from melanoma tissue to compare efficacy of melanin removal and yield of RNA. Furthermore, the capability of the different RNA preparations to function as template in RT-PCRs with products of different length, i.e. GAP-DH, tyrosinase, and gp100, was tested. We found that the combination of silica-based RNA-binding and size-exclusion columns was not sufficient to remove melanin from highly contaminated tumor samples, and subsequent RT-PCR failed to give larger products. However, protocols including ion-exchange columns resulted in efficient removal of melanin, while retaining reasonable RNA yields in samples from highly pigmented melanomas. Efficient RT-PCR of larger products turned out to be inversely correlated to the melanin contamination. This RNA-purification method will help scientists to isolate polynucleotides from melanin-containing tumor samples, which subsequently can be used in antigen detection assays and vaccination strategies using amplified total tumor RNA.",

To detect sensitively MIA transcripts in total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we established a sensitive PCR-ELISA system. With this assay, we detected one melanoma cell in 2 ml of blood by a single round of 32 PCR cycles. A total of 295 PBMC samples isolated from 166 patients with melanocytic tumors were tested with the MIA RT-PCR-ELISA: (a) 58 patients (99 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage I; (b) 49 patients (65 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage II; and (c) 47 patients (116 samples) with metastasized melanomas (stages III and IV), with an additional 12 patients (15 samples) with benign melanocytic nevi. Forty-four (26.8%) of 164 samples isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II were positive for MIA mRNA; in stages III/IV, 33 (28.4%) of 116 samples of patients, irrespective of clinically evident disease, were positive. Eleven (84.6%) of 13 PBMC samples from patients with metastasized melanoma and clinically evident disease without treatment were MIA mRNA-positive in contrast to only 19 (25.7%) of 74 samples isolated from patients in stage IV with metastasis during chemotherapy. Furthermore, none of the 16 PBMC samples of patients in stage IV without clinically detectable metastases at that time point during chemotherapy was MIA mRNA-positive. Interestingly, of the 44 positive samples (26.8%) isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II, 20 were still positive when retested after complete excision of the tumor. Our results reveal that amplification of MIA mRNA from the PBMCs of patients with malignant melanomas by PCR-ELISA provides a useful means to detect tumor cells in the systemic blood circulation. A correlation between positive blood samples and tumor burden in stages III and IV was detected, and, in addition, a significant effect of chemotherapy with respect to the reduction of the number of systemically spread tumor cells was observed.

Advantages and limitations of diverse, already established methods, such as (fluorescence) in situ hybridization and mutation analysis, to detect these cytogenetic alterations in melanocytic tumours are described. In addition, the potential value of more novel techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification is pointed out. This review demonstrates that at present cytogenetics has mainly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumours, with an important role for activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in the initiation of melanocytic tumours. Mutations in BRAF (in common naevocellular naevi), NRAS (congenital naevi), HRAS (Spitz naevi) and GNAQ (blue naevi) can all cause MAPK activation. All these mutations seem early events in the development of melanocytic tumours, but by themselves are insufficient to cause progression towards melanoma. Additional molecular alterations are implicated in progression towards melanoma, with different genetic alterations in melanomas at different sites and with varying levels of sun exposure. This genetic heterogeneity in distinct types of naevi and melanomas can be used for the development of molecular tests for diagnostic purposes. However, at the moment only few molecular tests have become of diagnostic value and are performed in daily routine practice. This is caused by lack of large prospective studies on the diagnostic value of molecular tests including follow-up, and by the low prevalence of certain molecular alterations. For the future we foresee an increasing role for cytogenetics in the treatment of melanoma patients with the increasing availability of targeted therapy. Potential targets for metastatic melanoma include genes involved in the MAPK pathway, such as BRAF and RAS. More recently, KIT has emerged as a potential target in melanoma patients. These targeted treatments all need careful evaluation, but might be a promising adjunct for treatment of metastatic melanoma patients, in which other therapies have not brought important survival advantages yet.",

Here we show (V600E)B-RAF copy-number gain as a mechanism of acquired B-RAF inhibitor resistance in 4 out of 20 (20%) patients treated with B-RAF inhibitor. In cell lines, (V600E)B-RAF overexpression and knockdown conferred B-RAF inhibitor resistance and sensitivity, respectively. In (V600E)B-RAF amplification-driven (versus mutant N-RAS-driven) B-RAF inhibitor resistance, extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation is saturable, with higher doses of vemurafenib down-regulating phosho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and re-sensitizing melanoma cells to B-RAF inhibitor. These two mechanisms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation are sensitive to the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244/selumetinib or its combination with the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib. In contrast to mutant N-RAS-mediated (V600E)B-RAF bypass, which is sensitive to C-RAF knockdown, (V600E)B-RAF amplification-mediated resistance functions largely independently of C-RAF. Thus, alternative clinical strategies may potentially overcome distinct modes of extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation underlying acquired B-RAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma.",

More than 90% of the patients develop hepatic metastasis with an average survival time of 7 months. We have used formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections to validate the presence of monosomy 3, an accurate predictor of metastasis, chromosome 8 isochromosome (8q22), and 1p36 deletion. This study also tested the presence of oncomirs in uveal melanoma samples by microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling.;Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was performed in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections of uveal melanoma to analyze chromosome 1, 3, and 8 aberrations (n=60). MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiling was done on paraffin sections of invasive tumor with liver metastasis (n=1) and non invasive tumor (n=1) in biological duplicates. Samples for miRNA expression profiling were identified based on case registry and the harboring of monosomy 3 by CISH.;A significant correlation (p=0.05) between metastasizing and non-metastasizing melanoma harboring chromosomal aberrations- monosomy3, c-myc, and 1p36 was observed by Pearson's correlation. A significant correlation was observed in monosomy 3 and 1p36 positive cases in the tumor samples (p=0.039). No significance was observed between monosomy 3 and c-myc positive cases. No significance (p=0.096) was observed between c-myc amplification and trisomy (extra whole chromosome 8). MicroRNA expression profiling revealed the presence of 19 miRNAs expressed in non-metastasizing melanoma and absent in metastasizing melanoma. Eleven miRNAs were found to be expressed in metastasizing melanoma and absent in non-metastasizing melanoma. Genes targeted by the miRNAs were found to be present in chromosomal regions 8p22, 13q, and 17p but were often found to be deleted.;This technique can be applied to routine pathology using archival specimens to identify patients with monosomy 3. We were able to perform CISH in all the cases except the heavily pigmented tumors, where dots were observed but were not assessed. Initial studies on microRNA have revealed their role as oncomirs in both metastasizing and non-metastasizing melanomas. Further studies may provide insights into their role in tumor progression and facilitate metastatic phenotype analysis.",

We investigated the effects of TGF-beta1 on IL-8 expression in the well-characterized A375 human melanoma system. We demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunoassay and Northern blot analysis that TGF-beta1 selectively induced IL-8 expression, at both protein and mRNA levels, in highly metastatic A375SM cells but not cells of their poorly metastatic parental line A375P. Transient transfection with luciferase reporter gene constructs revealed that TGF-beta1 activated IL-8 promoter activity in A375SM cells but not A375P cells. Studies with progressive 5' deletion constructs and site-specific mutations demonstrated that a construct containing -133 to +44 of the 5'-flanking sequence was necessary and sufficient for maximal TGF-beta1-induced transcription response and that TGF-beta1-induced activation of IL-8 promoter depended on AP-1 (-126 to -120 bp), NF-kappaB (-94 to -71 bp), and C/EBP-like factor NF-IL6 (-94 to -81 bp) in this region. Interestingly, both A375P and A375SM cells expressed type I and type II TGF-beta receptors and TGF-beta1 induced the nuclear translocation of Smad3 protein in both A375P and A375SM cells. Moreover, both A375P and A375SM cells were susceptible to TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition. Our data thus demonstrated that TGF-beta1 selectively induced IL-8 expression in highly metastatic A375SM melanoma cells.

To correctly classify a tumour process, it is essential not only to define its histological typology and identify its biological character but, at the same time, using immunohistochemistry and diagnostic molecular pathology, to evaluate prognostic and predictive indicators. As regards the prognostic indicators, it is mainly grading and staging as part of the TNM system, the sentinel lymph node assessment, if it is assessed, and other nodes extracted in this context. Histological specimens of invasive carcinomas and skin melanomas are assessed with respect to the depth of the invasion. Endocrine oestrogen and progesterone receptors are assessed in endocrine-dependent breast carcinomas. Predictive pathology uses biomarkers; biomarkers confirm the presence of target molecules following their reaction with the administered small molecule-like drugs, usually protein kinases or antibodies. HER2 gene amplification is estimated using the FISH method and predicts effectiveness of breast cancer therapies. In patients with a colon carcinoma, HER1 oncogene is identified immunohistochemically and the presence of a mutated K-ras is subsequently tested using the RT-PCR technique. CD 117 (c-kit) expression is determined in gastrointestinal stromal tumour and CD 20, 33 and 52 in malignant lymphomas and leukaemias. The most difficult task for a pathologist is defining the primary focus of the tumour in cases where only a fraction of a metastasis is available for examination. Nevertheless, at present, it is feasible to track the tumour differentiation down and, using an antibody battery, particularly against specific cytokeratines and vimentine and including organ-specific markers, to identify the primary source or at least to establish an assumption about the most likely organ affected by the tumour process.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer with an exceptionally bad prognosis. Melanoma often displays constitutively activated MAPK pathway through BRAF or NRAS mutations. It is also known that these mutations are almost never simultaneously present and that they appear at early stages and preserved throughout tumor progression, although it is proved that these alterations alone are insufficient to cause tumor progression. Therefore the first aim of our study was to evaluate those distinct genetic alterations which can properly differentiate the three important molecular subtypes of primary melanomas with a) BRAF, b) NRAS mutation and c) WT (wild type for both loci). High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used to assess genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations. Primary melanomas with BRAF mutation more frequently exhibited losses on 10q23-10q26 and gains on chromosome 7 and 1q23-1q25 compared to melanomas with NRAS mutation. Loss on the 11q23-11q25 sequence was found mainly in conjunction with NRAS mutation. Based on these results, we proved the existence of marked differences in the genetic pattern of the BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma subgroups, which might suggest that these mutations contribute to the development of malignant melanoma in conjunction with distinct cooperating oncogenic events. In general, it is an interesting phenomenon suggesting that these mutations provide probably the \"guiding force\" for these tumors and it also suggests that there are alternative genetic pathways to melanoma. These additional oncogenic events which are associated with BRAF or NRAS mutations can provide rational additional targets for a combination therapy with kinase inhibitors. In this study we also investigated the specific dynamic activities among different signalling pathways highlighting the frequent alterations of genes involved in the signalling interactions between the MAPK-JAK pathways in BRAF mutated melanomas. Using a data mining algorithm we also found a gene alteration signature in the MAPK pathway that was commonly related to the presence of BRAF mutation in our melanoma cohorts. The second aim of this study was to develop an accurate Q-PCR method for determining the co-amplification pattern of six candidate genes that reside in the 11q13 amplicon core. We found that co-amplification of these candidate genes or the CCND1 amplification along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone. ;A malignus melanóma a legrosszabb indulatú bõrdaganat, mely fokozott metasztázisképzéssel és gyógyszer-rezisztenciával jellemezhetõ.

BRAF(V600E) induces centrosome amplification and spindle abnormalities that result in aneuploidy. We find modification of Mps1 is critical for contributing to centrosome amplification and chromosome instability induced by BRAF(V600E). Phosphorylation of Mps1 at residue S281 induced by BRAF(V600E) stabilizes Mps1 protein by preventing its ubiquitination by APC/C and subsequent degradation, allowing the non-degraded protein to accumulate at centrosomes. Cells in which endogenous Mps1 was replaced with a phospho-mimetic Mps1 mutant are viable but amplify centrosomes and missegregate chromosomes frequently. Importantly, analysis of tumor micro arrays revealed that phospho-MAPK and S281-phosphorylated Mps1 were highly correlated in human melanoma tissues, implying that MAPK contributes to defects in the degradation of Mps1 in situ. We propose that continuously activated BRAF(V600E) signaling may be a possible mechanism for the deregulation of Mps1 stability and kinase activity in human tumors, and that persistent phosphorylation of Mps1 through BRAF(V600E) signaling is a key event in disrupting the control of centrosome duplication and chromosome stability that may contribute to tumorigenesis. Our findings raise the possibility that targeting the oncogenic BRAF and S281-phosphorylated Mps1, especially when used in combination could potentially provide great therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.",

These long HSR's on an X-chromosome and derivative chromosome 15, produced characteristic patterns of positive- and negative-staining areas along the HSR's with both conventional Giemsa (G) staining and C-banding. The C- and G-positive regions stained with distamycin A-DAPI, which is specific for the centromeric heterochromatin of chromosomes 1, 9, 15p, 16, and Y. DNA extracted from MeWo cells and digested with the restriction enzymes KpnL or Sau3A exhibited marked amplification of a 1.8-kilobase fragment. The amplified Sau3A fragment (D15Z1) was cloned, mapped, and partially sequenced. The sequenced region contained a five-base-pair repeat unit (adenine-adenine-thymine-guanine-guanine) that has undergone considerable divergence. Estimates of the size of the HSR's and the amount of amplified DNA suggested that each HSR contained at least 30,000 copies of the 1.8-kb KpnL fragment, representing about 50% of each HSR. The amplified sequence was identified as one member of the previously described KpnL family of repeated sequences. In situ hybridization of D15Z1 to MeWo metaphase chromosomes resulted in heavy labeling over both HSR's.

Promoter analyses of the 5'-flanking region of the human GD3 synthase gene using luciferase gene reporter system showed the strong promoter activity in SK-MEL-2 cells. Deletion study revealed that the region as the core promoter from -1146 to -646 (A of the translational start ATG as position +1) was indispensable for endogenous expression of human GD3 synthase gene.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using specific competitors, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that only NF-kappaB element in this region is required for the promoter activity in SK-MEL-2 cells. These results indicate that NF-kappaB plays an essential role in the transcriptional activity of human GD3 synthase gene essential for GD3 synthesis in SK-MEL-2 cells.",

There are five and six blocks of positively staining material on the X and der(15) HSRs, respectively. Hybridization in situ with a cloned repetitive Kpn I family member has confirmed the amplification of this sequence along the HSRs. With silver staining of the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) there appear to be three very strong and two weaker pairs of NORs along the HSR of the X chromosome and four strong and one weaker pair on that of the der(15) chromosome. There was little NOR staining on the normal acrocentric chromosomes in these cells, suggesting preferential transcription of the NORs in the HSRs. Centromere-dot staining revealed a distribution of multiple centromeres similar to the NORs along the two HSRs. These data suggest that a unit composed of the short arm and centromere of chromosome #15 has been amplified and that the HSR present on the X chromosome probably arose by a translocation from chromosome #15.",

To further examine the association between enhanced tumorigenicity and the presence of HSR-bearing chromosomes, hybrid cell lines were constructed by fusing X-HSR-containing MeWo cells with ouabain-resistant, HPRT-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells and culturing in HAT medium containing ouabain. A hybrid containing the X-HSR chromosome and several MeWo chromosomes was more tumorigenic in BALB/c nude mice than derivative cells lacking the X-HSR and human chromosome 18. However, since this enhanced tumorigenicity could be due to sequences on either the X-HSR or chromosome 18, a second series of hybrids was constructed by micro-cell fusion. In this case, the tumorigenicity of hybrid cells containing 2 copies of the X-HSR as the only MeWo chromosome was similar to that of derivative cells lacking these chromosomes. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) on the HSR were inactive in the hybrid cells. Our data indicate that DNA sequences amplified on MeWo HSRs do not enhance tumorigenicity under experimental conditions in which rRNA genes are not expressed. As the only active NORs in MeWo HSR-containing cells are on the HSRs, we suggest that expression of these amplified rRNA genes is responsible for the selective growth advantage of these cell types in nude mice. Our data also indicate that the enhanced tumorigenicity of MeWo HSR-containing cells is not due to co-amplification of a dominant oncogene.",

Incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine for one complete S phase and staining with the Hoechst 33258 fluorescence plus Giemsa technique reveals complex asymmetries within the additional segments.

A standardized method allowing for high-throughput structural profiling and functional characterization of living cell surface GSLs is of growing importance because they function as crucial signal transduction molecules in various processes of dynamic cellular recognitions. However, methods are not available for amplification of GSLs, while the genomic scale PCR amplification permits large-scale mammalian proteomic analysis. Here we communicate such an approach to a novel \"omics\", namely, glycosphingolipidomics based on the \"glycoblotting\" method. The method, which involves selective ozonolysis of the C-C double bond in the ceramide moiety and subsequent enrichment of generated GSL aldehydes by chemical ligation using an aminooxy-functionalized gold nanoparticle (aoGNP) should be of widespread utility for identifying and characterizing whole GSLs present in the living cell surfaces. The present protocol using glycoblotting permitted MALDI-TOFMS-based high-throughput structural profiling of mouse brain gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a/GD1b, and GT1b for adult or GD3 in the case for the embryonic mouse. When mouse melanoma B16 cells were subjected to this protocol, it was demonstrated that gangliosides enriched from the plasma membranes are the only GM3 bearing microheteogeneity in the structure of the N-acyl chain. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that aoGNP displaying whole GSLs blotted from mouse B16 melanoma cell surfaces can be used directly for monitoring the specific interaction with the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of Gg3Cer (gangliotriaosylceramide). Our results indicate that GSL-selective enrichment onto aoGNP from living cell surfaces allows for rapid reconstruction of plasma membrane models mimicking the intact GSL microdomain feasible for further structural and functional characterization.",

However, therapy with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, is limited in practice due to adverse systemic effects. Spatially-restricted gene expression circumvents this problem by enabling localized amplification. Intracellular co-delivery of gold nanorods (AuNR) and a heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) promoter-driven expression vector enables gene expression in response to near infrared (NIR) light. AuNRs absorb the light, convert it into heat and thereby stimulate photothermal expression of the cytokine. As proof-of-concept, human HeLa and murine B16 cancer cells were transfected with a HSP70-Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) plasmid and polyethylenimine (PEI)-conjugated AuNRs. Exposure to either 42 °C heat-shock or NIR light induced significant expression of the reporter gene. In vivo NIR driven expression of the reporter gene was confirmed at 6 and 24 h in mice bearing B16 melanoma tumors using in vivo imaging and flow-cytometric analysis. Overall, we demonstrate a novel opportunity for site-directed, heat-inducible expression of a gene based upon the NIR-absorbing properties of AuNRs and a HSP70 promoter-driven expression vector. ",

To date, expression of human IL-10 has been attributed primarily to helper T lymphocytes, activated monocytes, and neoplastic B cells, and was often found to be associated with IL-6 expression. In this study we sought to determine whether non-hematopoietic human tumor cell lines produce IL-10 and, if so, what is the relationship between IL-10 and IL-6. Using ELISA, we determined IL-10 and IL-6 levels in culture supernatants of 48 cell lines established from carcinomas of the kidney, colon, breast and pancreas, malignant melanomas and neuroblastomas. IL-6 protein was secreted by 28 of the tumor cell lines; IL-10 was measurable in 15 cell lines. IL-6 secretion was maximal and most frequent in renal-cancer cell lines, while IL-10 production was found to be highest and most common among cell lines derived from colon carcinomas. IL-10 in conditioned medium of one of the colon carcinoma cell lines (CCL222) was bio-active, as demonstrated in the mouse MC/9 mast-cell-line assay and in human mixed-lymphocyte reactions. In both assays, IL-10 bio-activity was neutralized by an anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody. Expression of IL-6 and IL-10 was confirmed by RNA analysis using message amplification by PCR and sequencing of amplified cDNA. LPS, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha strongly enhanced the release of IL-6 by RCC cells, but only marginally affected IL-10 production in colon-carcinoma cells. IL-10 secretion by colon-carcinoma cells was moderately stimulated by IFN-gamma and IL-4. Dexamethasone suppressed the release of IL-6, but had no inhibitory effect on IL-10 secretion. Our results demonstrate that tumor cell lines established from certain types of human carcinomas are capable of expressing and releasing IL-6 and/or IL-10, suggesting a role of these cytokines in solid-tumor development and anti-tumor immunity.",

To elucidate the role of oncogenes in UV carcinogenesis, we analyzed UV-induced murine skin tumors for mutations in codon 12, 13, or 61 of Ha-ras, Ki-ras, and N-ras oncogenes by amplification of genomic tumor DNAs by the polymerase chain reaction followed by dot-blot hybridization to synthetic oligonucleotide probes designed to detect single base-pair mutations. In addition to UV-induced C3H mouse skin tumors, we also analyzed skin tumors induced in the same strain of mice by other carcinogenic agents such as 8-methoxypsoralen + UVA, angelicin + UVA, dimethylbenz-[a]anthracene + UV + croton oil, and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. We found that 4 of 20 UV-induced skin tumors contained either C----A or A----G base substitutions at N-ras codon 61. In addition, 2 of 5 melanomas possessed a G----A transition in N-ras codon 13 and an A----T transversion in N-ras codon 61, respectively. Interestingly, none of the 8-methoxypsoralen + UVA- or angelicin + UVA-induced tumors we analyzed contained mutations in any of the ras genes. However, 1 of 4 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-induced tumors exhibited a G----T transversion at Ki-ras codon 12, a potential site for formation of a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide adduct with a guanine residue. We also found that 2 nonmelanoma tumors induced by dimethylbenz[a]anthracene + UV + croton oil contained an A----T transversion at Ha-ras codon 61 position 2, which is characteristic of most dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced tumors. These results suggest that UV-induced C3H mouse tumors display mutations preferentially in the N-ras oncogene. Since most N-ras mutations in UV-induced tumors occurred opposite dipyrimidine sequences (T-T or C-C), one can infer that these sites are the targets for UV-induced mutation and transformation.",

We investigated the mechanisms for this differential type I IFN production in cells infected with representative MV strains. The overexpression of the wild-type V protein suppressed melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)-induced IFN-β promoter activity, while this was not seen in A549 cells expressing CD150 transfected with the V protein of the vaccine strain. The V proteins of the wild-type also suppressed poly I:C-induced IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) dimerization. The V proteins of the wild-type and vaccine strain did not affect retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)- or toll-IL-1R homology domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1)-induced IFN-β promoter activation. We identified an amino acid substitution of the cysteine residue at position 272 (which is conserved among paramyxoviruses) to an arginine residue in the V protein of the vaccine strain. Only the V protein possessing the 272C residue binds to MDA5. The mutation introduced into the wild-type V protein (C272R) was unable to suppress MDA5-induced IRF-3 nuclear translocation and IFN-β promoter activation as seen in the V proteins of the vaccine strain, whereas the mutation introduced in the vaccine strain V protein (R272C) was able to inhibit MDA5-induced IRF-3 and IFN-β promoter activation. The other 6 residues of the vaccine strain V sequence inconsistent with the authentic sequence of the wild-type V protein barely affected the IRF-3 nuclear translocation. These data suggested that the structural difference of laboratory-adapted [corrected] MV V protein hampers MDA5 blockade and acts as a nidus for the spread/amplification of type I IFN induction. Ultimately, measles vaccine strains have two modes of IFN-β-induction for their attenuation: V protein mutation and production of defective interference (DI) RNA.",
