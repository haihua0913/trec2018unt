We previously generated the rat monoclonal antibody MsMab-2, which recognizes isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 R132L and IDH2 R172M. In the present study, we used an immunohistochemical method to examine MsMab-2 immunoreactivity in 95 cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, including five IDH1 R132L and one IDH2 R172M mutant cases confirmed by direct sequencing. Tissue microarray section slides of all IDH1/2-mutant and wild-type cases, as well as whole section slides of IDH1 R132L and IDH2 R172M cases were immunostained using an autostainer. All IDH1 R132L cases showed positive staining for MsMab-2, while other IDH1/2 mutant and IDH1/2 wild-type cases were negative. Tumor cells of the immunopositive cases invariably showed strong reactivity using whole-section slides. We consider immunohistochemical analysis using MsMab-2 to be a useful means of detecting IDH1 R132L. Further analysis of its effectiveness against IDH2 R172M is necessary because of the small sample size in this study.",

Our clinical application of broad-based mutational profiling for patients diagnosed with a gastrointestinal malignancy has led to the novel discovery of mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in tumors from a subset of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. A total of 287 tumors from gastrointestinal cancer patients (biliary tract, colorectal, gastroesophageal, liver, pancreatic, and small intestine carcinoma) were tested during routine clinical evaluation for 130 site-specific mutations within 15 cancer genes. Mutations were identified within a number of genes, including KRAS (35%), TP53 (22%), PIK3CA (10%), BRAF (7%), APC (6%), NRAS (3%), AKT1 (1%), CTNNB1 (1%), and PTEN (1%). Although mutations in the metabolic enzyme IDH1 were rare in the other common gastrointestinal malignancies in this series (2%), they were found in three tumors (25%) of an initial series of 12 biliary tract carcinomas. To better define IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status, an additional 75 gallbladder and bile duct cancers were examined. Combining these cohorts of biliary cancers, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were found only in cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin (nine of 40, 23%) and in none of the 22 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and none of the 25 gallbladder carcinomas. In an analysis of frozen tissue specimens, IDH1 mutation was associated with highly elevated tissue levels of the enzymatic product 2-hydroxyglutarate. Thus, IDH1 mutation is a molecular feature of cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin. These findings define a specific metabolic abnormality in this largely incurable type of gastrointestinal cancer and present a potentially new target for therapy.",

We discovered IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in 34 of 326 (10%) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Tumor with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 had lower 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher 5-methylcytosine levels, as well as increased dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 were associated with longer overall survival (P=0.028) and were independently associated with a longer time to tumor recurrence after intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma resection in multivariate analysis (P=0.021). IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were significantly associated with increased levels of p53 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, but no mutations in the p53 gene were found, suggesting that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 may cause a stress that leads to p53 activation. We identified 2309 genes that were significantly hypermethylated in 19 cholangiocarcinomas with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2, compared with cholangiocarcinomas without these mutations. Hypermethylated CpG sites were significantly enriched in CpG shores and upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting a global regulation of transcriptional potential. Half of the hypermethylated genes overlapped with DNA hypermethylation in IDH1-mutant gliobastomas, suggesting the existence of a common set of genes whose expression may be affected by mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in different types of tumors.",

To date, mutations in the IDH1 gene have been found in numerous cancers with the highest frequencies occurring in gliomas, chondrosarcomas/enchondromas and cholangiocarcinomas.;IDH1 was first described in the scientific literature as early as 1950. Early researchers proposed that the enzyme likely functions in cellular lipid metabolism based on the observation that the enzymatic reaction produces NADPH and partially localizes to peroxisomes. This article highlights the studies implicating IDH1 in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal lipid metabolism from the early researchers to the recent studies examining mutant IDH1(R132), the most common IDH1 mutation found in cancer.;While a role for IDH1 in lipid biosynthesis in the liver and adipose tissue is now established, a role in lipid metabolism in the brain and tumors is beginning to be examined. The recent discoveries that IDH1(R132H) interferes with the metabolism of phospholipids in gliomas and that IDH1 activity could participate in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from glutamine in hypoxic tumors highlight roles for IDH1 in lipid metabolism in a broad spectrum of tissues.;Interferences in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal lipid metabolism by IDH1(R132) may contribute to the more favorable clinical outcome in patients whose tumors express mutations in the IDH1 gene.",

Kinetic expression of HGD, IDH1 and IDH2 in the animal model of O. viverrini infection-induced CCA was correlated with human CCA cases. In the animal model, expression of HGD was decreased at all time points (p<0.01) and expression of both IDH1 and IDH2 was decreased in the CCA group. In human cases, expression of HGD, IDH1 and IDH2 was decreased more than 2 fold in 55 cases (70.5%), 25 cases (32.1%) and 24 cases (30.8%) respectively.

The incidence of CCA is also increasing in other countries, including Japan. Here, we overview the genetic and transcriptional alterations of CCA with and without association with Ov infection. CCA with Ov shows enhanced expression of the genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and chronic inflammatory responses, including cytokine signaling, whereas CCA without Ov shows enhanced expression of growth factor signaling, such as HER2. Exome and the following prevalence sequencing identified mutations of the BAP1, ARID1A, IDH1 and IDH2 genes in CCA, in addition to the high incidence of known mutations in the TP53, KRAS2 SMAD4, and CDKN2A genes, suggesting the role of chromatin modulators in CCA pathogenesis. CCA with Ov shows significantly higher incidence of the TP53 gene mutation, whereas CCA without Ov showed significantly more frequent mutations of the BAP1, IDH1 and IDH2 genes. However, CCAs with Ov and without Ov share a similar mutation spectrum dominated by C : G > T : A transitions mainly at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting that CCA shares etiologic factors with pancreatic ductal carcinoma but not with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Mutant IDH proteins in IHCC and other malignancies acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity allowing them to convert α-ketoglutarate (αKG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which inhibits the activity of multiple αKG-dependent dioxygenases, and results in alterations in cell differentiation, survival, and extracellular matrix maturation. However, the molecular pathways by which IDH mutations lead to tumour formation remain unclear. Here we show that mutant IDH blocks liver progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation through the production of 2HG and suppression of HNF-4α, a master regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence. Correspondingly, genetically engineered mouse models expressing mutant IDH in the adult liver show an aberrant response to hepatic injury, characterized by HNF-4α silencing, impaired hepatocyte differentiation, and markedly elevated levels of cell proliferation. Moreover, IDH and Kras mutations, genetic alterations that co-exist in a subset of human IHCCs, cooperate to drive the expansion of liver progenitor cells, development of premalignant biliary lesions, and progression to metastatic IHCC. These studies provide a functional link between IDH mutations, hepatic cell fate, and IHCC pathogenesis, and present a novel genetically engineered mouse model of IDH-driven malignancy. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive cancer associated with the bile ducts within the liver. These tumors are characterized by frequent gain-of-function mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes-that are also common in subsets of neural, haematopoietic and bone tumors, but rare or absent in the other types of gastrointestinal malignancy. Mutant IDH acts through a novel mechanism of oncogenesis, producing high levels of the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which interferes with the function of α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes that regulate diverse cellular processes including histone demethylation and DNA modification. Recently, we used in vitro stem cell systems and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) to demonstrate that mutant IDH promotes ICC formation by blocking hepatocyte differentiation and increasing pools of hepatic progenitors that are susceptible to additional oncogenic hits leading to ICC. We found that silencing of HNF4A-encoding a master transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence-was critical to mutant IDH-mediated inhibition of liver differentiation. In line with these findings, human ICC with IDH mutations are characterized by a hepatic progenitor cell transcriptional signature suggesting that they are a distinct ICC subtype as compared to IDH wild type tumors. The role of mutant IDH in controlling hepatic differentiation state suggests the potential of newly developed inhibitors of the mutant enzyme as a form of differentiation therapy in a solid tumor. ",

As the inhibition for those tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins may induce differentiation of those cancer cells, these tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins can be treated as a drug target proteins for a differentiation therapy against cancers. In this study, we aim to identify the potent TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan as lead compounds of IDH2 R140Q mutant inhibitor. Comparing to the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein inhibitor, AGI-6780, the top two TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation. After MD simulation, the top two TCM compounds remain as the same docking poses under dynamic conditions. In addition, precatorine is extracted from Abrus precatorius L., which represents the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects for breast cancer and several tumor lines. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein against cancer.

For AML, low-grade glioma and CC, mutant IDH status is associated with a DNA hypermethylation phenotype, implicating altered epigenome dynamics in the aetiology of these cancers. Here we show that the IDH variants in CS are also associated with a hypermethylation phenotype and display increased production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, supporting the role of mutant IDH-produced 2-hydroxyglutarate as an inhibitor of TET-mediated DNA demethylation. Meta-analysis of the acute myeloid leukaemia, low-grade glioma, cholangiocarcinoma and CS methylation data identifies cancer-specific effectors within the retinoic acid receptor activation pathway among the hypermethylated targets. By analysing sequence motifs surrounding hypermethylated sites across the four cancer types, and using chromatin immunoprecipitation and western blotting, we identify the transcription factor EBF1 (early B-cell factor 1) as an interaction partner for TET2, suggesting a sequence-specific mechanism for regulating DNA methylation.

The mutational profile was correlated with the clinical outcome of standard and experimental therapies for 321 patients. Clinical variables, detected mutations, and administered therapies were correlated with overall survival (OS) in a Cox regression model.;The most frequent genetic aberrations (GAs) observed were tumor protein 53 (TP53; 27%), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B; 27%), KRAS (22%), AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A; 18%), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1; 16%) in IHCCA; KRAS (42%), TP53 (40%), CDKN2A/B (17%), and SMAD4 (21%) in EHCCA; and TP53 (59%), CDKN2A/B (19%), ARID1A (13%), and ERBB2 (16%) in GBCA. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR; 11%) and IDH mutations (20%) were mostly limited to IHCCA but appeared to be mutually exclusive. In the IHCCA group, TP53 and KRAS mutations were associated significantly with poor OS, whereas FGFR2 mutations were associated with improved OS (P = .001), a younger age at onset, and female sex. IDH1/2 mutations were not prognostic. In a multivariate model, the effects of TP53 and FGFR GAs remained significant (P < .05). Patients with FGFR GAs had superior OS with FGFR-targeted therapy versus standard regimens (P = .006).

Clinical presentation is often late, precluding curative surgical resection in most cases. For advanced disease, therapeutic options are limited to systemic chemotherapy, with suboptimal outcomes. An understanding of the molecular characteristics of biliary tract cancers may allow the clinical development of therapies targeting actionable alterations with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes. We present a comprehensive review of biliary tract cancer genomics and their clinical implications. Alterations in genes in the EGFR-MAPK-PI3K pathway are seen most often. KRAS alterations are highly prevalent; BRAF alterations are mutually exclusive from RAS alterations and much less frequent. PIK3CA alterations are seen mostly in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancers whereas HER2 amplification is most common in gallbladder cancers. Various tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 and p16 are also altered often in biliary tract cancers; however, agents to \"activate\" silenced genes are currently lacking. FGF and IDH pathway alterations are potential targets for therapeutic agents. FGF alterations are typically fusions with other genes, resulting in altered proteins, and are seen most often in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. IDH pathway alterations affect cellular enzymatic processes and are most common in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Ongoing clinical trials of agents targeting these pathways hold the promise of improving clinical outcomes.",

To gain insight into its molecular alterations, we performed whole-genome sequencing analysis on 30 LCBs.

The subsequent validation study on 68 LCBs identified recurrent mutations in TERT promoter, chromatin regulators (BAP1, PBRM1 and ARID2), a synapse organization gene (PCLO), IDH genes and KRAS. The frequencies of KRAS and IDHs mutations, which are associated with poor disease-free survival, were significantly higher in hepatitis-negative LCBs.

        "Doc_abstract":"Patients with malignant gliomas have a poor prognosis with average survival of less than 1 year. Whereas in other tumor entities the characteristics of tumor metabolism are successfully used for therapeutic approaches, such developments are very rare in brain tumors, notably in gliomas. One metabolic feature characteristic of gliomas, in particular diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors, is the variable content of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), a metabolite that was discovered first in this tumor entity. D2HG is generated in large amounts due to various \"gain-of-function\" mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2. Meanwhile, D2HG has been detected in several other tumor entities, including intrahepatic bile-duct cancer, chondrosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. D2HG is barely detectable in healthy tissue (<0.1 mM), but its concentration increases up to 35 mM in malignant tumor tissues. Consequently, the \"oncometabolite\" D2HG has gained increasing interest in the field of tumor metabolism. To facilitate its quantitative measurement without loss of spatial resolution at a microscopical level, we have developed a novel bioluminescence assay for determining D2HG in sections of snap-frozen tissue. The assay was verified independently by photometric tests and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The novel technique allows the microscopically resolved determination of D2HG in a concentration range of 0-10 μmol/g tissue (wet weight). In combination with the already established bioluminescence imaging techniques for ATP, glucose, pyruvate, and lactate, the novel D2HG assay enables a comparative characterization of the metabolic profile of individual tumors in a further dimension.
