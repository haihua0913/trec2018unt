In spite of the advances in breast cancer detection, the molecular basis of impalpable lesions and the corresponding circulating biomarkers are not well understood. Impalpable lesions, classified by radiologists according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System in the categories 3 and 4, can be either benign or malignant (slow growing or aggressive). In this article, we report the DNA methylation pattern in CDKN2A (p14(ARF)/p16(INK4a)) and in ATM gene promoters from 62 impalpable lesions, 39 peripheral blood samples, and 39 saliva samples, assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction method. ATM showed the greatest percentage of methylation in DNA from lesions (benign and malignant), blood (even with p16(INK4a)), and saliva, followed by p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). Among the malignant cases, ATM promoter was the most hypermethylated in lesion DNA and in blood and saliva DNAs, and p14(ARF), the least. The highest percentage of p16(INK4a) methylation was found in the blood. Finally, our data are relevant because they were obtained using impalpable breast lesions from patients who were carefully recruited in 2 public hospitals of Rio de Janeiro. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"CDKN2A (p16(INK4a)) is a crucial tumor suppressor involved in many cancers. Our recent investigations revealed that FOXA1 as a forkhead transcription factor mediates CDKN2A activation in cellular senescence. However, the contribution of this axis in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, using a comprehensive collection of cancer microarray data, we found FOXA1 is down-regulated in many cancers compared to their normal counterparts and the positive correlation between FOXA1 and CDKN2A could be observed in prostate and breast cancers with lower EZH2 (epigenetic repressor for CDKN2A) expression. Experimentally, epistasis analysis in prostate and breast cancer cells indicated that higher expression of FOXA1 opposes EZH2-mediated CDKN2A repression, as further depletion of FOXA1 reverts the de-silencing of CDKN2A caused by EZH2 inhibition. Concomitantly, EZH2-depletion suppresses cancer cell cycle progression and this regulation is optimized in the presence of FOXA1 and CDKN2A. A further oncogenic transformation assay suggested that overexpression of EZH2 is insufficient to block RAS-induced CDKN2A activation and loss of FOXA1 is mandatory to potentiate EZH2-mediated CDKN2A silencing and to bypass the senescence barrier. Importantly, using an in vitro histone methyltransferase (HMTase) system, we found FOXA1 directly inhibits EZH2's histone methyltransferase activity through its C-terminal histone binding motif. These data support that positive regulation of CDKN2A by FOXA1 counteracts its tumorigenic repression of by EZH2 in cancers. ",

We analyzed families with two or more cases of melanoma for germline mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 to elucidate the contribution of these gene defects to familial malignant melanoma and to the occurrence of other cancer types.;: The entire CDKN2A coding region and exon 2 of the CDK4 gene of an affected member of each of 52 families from southern Sweden with at least two cases of melanoma in first- or second-degree relatives were screened for mutations by use of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided.;: CDKN2A mutations were found in 10 (19%) of the 52 families. Nine families carried an identical alteration consisting of the insertion of arginine at position 113 of p16(INK4a), and one carried a missense mutation, in which the valine at position 115 was replaced with a glycine. The 113insArg mutant p16(INK4a) was unable to bind cdk4 and cdk6 in an in vitro binding assay. Six of the 113insArg families had at least one member with multiple primary melanomas; the 113insArg families also had a high frequency of other malignancies-in particular, breast cancer (a total of eight cases compared with the expected 2.1; P =.0014) and pancreatic cancer (a total of six cases compared with the expected 0.16; P<.0001). Families with breast cancer also had a propensity for multiple melanomas in females, suggesting that a sex-dependent factor may modify the phenotypic expression of CDKN2A alterations.;: Our findings confirm that the majority of CDKN2A-associated melanoma families in Sweden are due to a single founder mutation. They also show that families with the CDKN2A 113insArg mutation have an increased risk not only of multiple melanomas and pancreatic carcinoma but also of breast cancer.",

Invariant inactivation of either the p16(INK4a)-cyclin D/CDK-pRb pathway and/or p53-p14(ARF) pathway occurs in most human tumors. Cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer cells contributing an alternate mechanism inactivating the p16(INK4a)/pRb pathway. Targeted overexpression of cyclin D1 to the mammary gland is sufficient for tumorigenesis, and cyclin D1-/- mice are resistant to Ras-induced mammary tumors. Recent studies suggest cyclin D1 and p16(INK4a) expression are reciprocal in human breast cancers. Herein, reciprocal regulation of cyclin D1 and p16(INK4a) was observed in tissues of mice mutant for the Ink4a/Arf locus. p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) inhibited DNA synthesis in MCF7 cells. p16(INK4a) repressed cyclin D1 expression and transcription. Repression of cyclin D1 by p16(INK4a) occurred independently of the p16(INK4a)-cdk4-binding function and required a cAMP-response element/activating transcription factor-2-binding site. p19(ARF) repressed cyclin D1 through a novel distal cis-element at -1137, which bound p53 in chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays. Transcriptional repression of the cyclin D1 gene through distinct DNA sequences may contribute to the tumor suppressor function of the Ink4a/Arf locus.",

Epigenetic alterations involved in the onset and progression of breast cancer may serve as biomarkers for early detection and prediction of disease prognosis. Furthermore, using body fluids such as serum offers a non-invasive method to procure multiple samples for biomarker analyses. The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between methylation status of multiple cancer genes, p16(INK4A), p14(ARF), Cyclin D2 and Slit2 in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and paired serum DNA and clinicopathological parameters. Of the 36 breast cancer patients investigated, 31 (86%) tumors and 30 (83%) paired sera showed methylation of at least one of these 4 genes. Methylation frequencies varied from 27% for CyclinD2, 44% for p16(INK4A), 47% for p14(ARF) to 58% for Slit2. There was concordance between DNA methylation in tumor and paired serum DNA of each gene. This study underscores the potential utility of DNA methylation based screening of serum as a surrogate marker for tumor DNA methylation status of these genes in breast cancer. Further, expression profile of p16(INK4A) could be linked to epigenetic events, thus suggesting this pathway as a potential target for therapeutic strategies based on reversal of epigenetic silencing.",

Recently, we reported loss of heterozygosity of the region in which p16(INK4a) is located in more than one-half of primary breast tumors. However, mutational analysis of these same tumors revealed mutation of p16(INK4a) to be infrequent. Other possible modes of inactivation, such as de novo methylation and homozygous deletion, have since been shown to occur in numerous neoplasias. Furthering the complexity of this locus, a transcript overlapping the p16(INK4a) coding sequence and encoding a novel peptide with growth-suppressive activity, p19(ARF), has been described. To clearly elucidate the target of aberrations affecting this subchromosomal region and approximate frequency in breast cancer, we performed a comprehensive study including p16 deletion analysis by means of interphase chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization, methylation analysis of the first exon encoding p16(INK4a) (exon 1alpha), mutational analysis of exon 1beta by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of p19(ARF) transcripts, and expression of both alpha and beta transcripts by reverse transcription PCR. Homozygous deletion of p16, as determined by interphase chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization, was observed in 3 of 18 (17%) tumors analyzed, whereas de novo methylation of exon 1alpha was observed in an additional 17% (4 of 23). Reduced expression of p16(INK4a) was observed in 11 tumors (48%), including all those in which homozygous deletion or complete methylation was observed. No mutations of exon 1 beta were detected, and expression of its transcript was variable, with 13% demonstrating decreased expression and 17% demonstrating overexpression. These results further support p16(INK4a) as a target of inactivation in the 9p21 region for breast cancer.",

The INK4A gene encodes two cell cycle regulators, p16(INK4A) and ARF, while INK4B encodes p15(INK4B). Previously, we have shown that the p16(INK4) tumor suppressor was not mutated or deleted in primary breast carcinomas. However, primary and metastatic breast carcinomas exhibited a relative hypomethylation of p16(INK4A), which is associated with expression, compared to normal breast tissue. The present study was conducted to determine if inactivation of p15(INK4B) and INK4A exon 1beta (ARF) are common events in breast carcinoma. Mutational analysis was performed by PCR-SSCP, and mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. Methylation-specific PCR was used to determine the methylation status of the p15(INK4B) promoter. Our results demonstrate that the p15(INK4B) gene was altered in 3 (21%) of the 14 breast cell lines; one had a silent mutation and two had homozygous deletion of the gene. None of the cell lines showed methylation of p15(INK4B). Two (14%) cell lines had homozygous deletion of INK4A exon 1beta. All normal and malignant breast tissue samples were wild-type and non-methylated for p15(INK4B) and wild-type for exon 1beta.

We elucidated genetic determinants underlying tumor escape in a transgenic mouse model of Wnt pathway-driven breast cancer, wherein targeted therapy is simulated by abrogating doxycycline-dependent Wnt1 transgene expression within established tumors. In mice with intact tumor suppressor pathways, tumors typically circumvented doxycycline withdrawal by reactivating Wnt signaling, either via aberrant (doxycycline-independent) Wnt1 transgene expression or via acquired somatic mutations in the gene encoding beta-catenin. Germline introduction of mutant tumor suppressor alleles into the model altered the timing and mode of tumor escape. Relapses occurring in the context of null Ink4a/Arf alleles (disrupting both the p16 Ink4a and p19 Arf tumor suppressors) arose quickly and rarely reactivated the Wnt pathway. In addition, Ink4a/Arf-deficient relapses resembled p53-deficient relapses in that both displayed morphologic and molecular hallmarks of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, Ink4a/Arf deficiency promoted relapse in the absence of gross genomic instability. Moreover, Ink4a/Arf-encoded proteins differed in their capacity to suppress oncogene independence. Isolated p19 Arf deficiency mirrored p53 deficiency in that both promoted rapid, EMT-associated mammary tumor escape, whereas isolated p16 Ink4a deficiency failed to accelerate relapse. Thus, p19 Arf/p53 pathway lesions may promote mammary cancer relapse even when inhibition of a targeted oncogenic signaling pathway remains in force.",

The PANDAR/Bmi1/p16(INK4A) axis could serve as novel targets for breast cancer therapy. ",

The gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast carcinomas, similar to CDKN2A, a recognized tumor suppressor gene. Several research groups have shown that MTAP acts as a tumor suppressor, and some therapeutic approaches were proposed based on a tumors´ MTAP status. We analyzed MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression in seven breast cancer cell lines and evaluated their promoter methylation patterns to better characterize the contribution of these genes to breast cancer. Cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX) after MTAP gene knockdown showed an increased sensitivity, mainly to 5-FU. MTAP expression was also evaluated in two groups of samples from breast cancer patients, fresh tumors and paired normal breast tissue, and from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core breast cancer samples diagnosed as Luminal-A tumors and triple negative breast tumors (TNBC). The difference of MTAP expression between fresh tumors and normal tissues was not statistically significant. However, MTAP expression was significantly higher in Luminal-A breast tumors than in TNBC, suggesting the lack of expression in more aggressive breast tumors and the possibility of using the new approaches based on MTAP status in TNBC.

In addition, 6 variants of unknown signification were identified in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Regarding family history, 3/13 (23%) patients with a positive family history of BC or CMM were carriers of a germline mutation, whereas only 3/69 (4%) patients without family history were carriers of a germline mutation.;Our findings show that few patients with BC and CMM who lacked family histories of these cancers are carriers of deleterious germline mutations in four of the five genes we examined.

Despite omissions in the published p16 transcript and canine genome and the presence of GC-rich repeats, we determined the complete coding sequence of canine p16 revealing a deletion and frameshift mutation in p16 exon 1α in CMT28 cells. In addition, we determined canine p14ARF mRNA and protein sequences. Mapping of these mutations uncovered important aspects of p16 and p14ARF expression and defects in CMT28 cells shifting the p16 reading frame into p14ARF making a fusion protein that was predicted to be truncated, unstable and devoid of structural and functional integrity.

Since CDKIs can inhibit cell proliferation, they may have a role as tumor suppressor genes. To determine if alterations of CDKI genes may be involved in tumorigenesis of breast cancer, we examined the mutational status of p16(INK4A), p15(INK4B), p18(INK4C), p19(INK4D) CDKI genes in 36 primary breast carcinomas and 9 breast cancer cell lines using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), direct DNA sequencing, and Southern blot analysis. Furthermore, amplification of cyclin D1, D2, D3 genes were also examined in these samples. One mutation of p15(INK4B) gene occurred, resulting in change of aspartic acid to asparagine at codon 85. Since aspartic acid at this position is conserved between all four human and murine INK4 proteins, this missense mutation may have functional significance. The sample with a p15(INK4B) point mutation was accompanied by amplification of the cyclin D1 gene. A deletion of the p18(INK4C) gene was found in a primary tumor. Three deletions of the p16(INK4A) gene and two deletions of the p15(INK4B) gene were found in the cell lines. Also, we found amplification of the p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) loci in a clinical sample as well as amplification of the p19(INK4D) in another sample, and amplification of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene in one cell line and two primary tumors. We suspect that a critical gene for breast cancer is amplified near the MPO gene. These data indicate that CDKI mutations are moderately rare in breast cancer and are often associated with the simultaneous alteration of more than one cell-cycle regulatory gene.",

Additionally, the above results pushed us to hypothesize that genetic homogeneity will be seen in Poland in studies of other genes. Actually, the next studies allowed us to identify genes / changes associated with moderate / low breast cancer risk and showed, similarly to BRCA1, high level of genetic homogeneity. This series included BRCA2, C5972T, CHEK2 del5395; 1100delC, I157T or IVS2 + 1G > A, CDKN2A (p16) A148T, XPD Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln, CYP1B1 R48G, A119S and L43V.

Here, we evaluated how expression of p16 in breast tissue biopsies of women with atypical hyperplasia (AH), a putative precursor lesion to DCIS, is associated with subsequent development of cancer. p16 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in archival sections from 233 women with AH diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic. p16 expression in the atypical lesions was scored by percentage of positive cells and intensity of staining. We also studied coexpression of p16, with Ki-67 and COX-2, biomarkers of progression in AH. Risk factor and follow-up data were obtained via study questionnaire and medical records. Forty-seven patients (20%) developed breast cancer with a median follow-up of 14.5 years. Staining of p16 was increased in older patients relative to younger patients (P = 0.0025). Although risk of developing breast cancer was not associated with increased p16 expression, joint overexpression of Ki-67 and COX-2 was found to convey stronger risk of breast cancer in the first 10 years after diagnosis as compared with one negative marker (P < 0.01).

In vitro, nuclear p14ARF binds Hdm2 to block Hdm2-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of p53, which is required before cytoplasmic degradation of p53. p14ARF is negatively regulated by p53 and through p53-independent pathways. No studies have yet examined levels of p14ARF protein expression in breast cancer and their relationship to Hdm2/p53 immunoreactivity or subcellular localisation. Previously, immunohistochemical expression of cytoplasmic p14ARF, p53 and Hdm2 has been described. HER-2 (c-erbB2/neu) predicts prognosis and interacts with the p14ARF/Hdm2 pathway to inactivate p14ARF and to influence Hdm2 activity and localisation. This study examined p14ARF and p53/Hdm2 expression and subcellular localisation by using immunohistochemistry in a series of invasive ductal breast cancers (IDCs) with concomitant ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), to evaluate whether findings in vitro were related to clinicopathological parameters such as HER-2 and their effect on patient outcome.;The 4C6 anti-p14ARF monoclonal antibody and Dako Envision Plus system were used to evaluate p14ARF expression in 103 patients; p53/Hdm2 staining was performed.;p14ARF was evaluable in 96 patients, with nuclear p14ARF expression (modified Quick-score > or = 3) in 79% (n = 76) of IDCs and in associated DCIS in 74 patients. Cytoplasmic p14ARF was detectable in 23 breast cancers. Nuclear and cytoplasmic p14ARF showed no correlation with p53 subcellular immunoreactivity. Increasing levels of cytoplasmic p14ARF were associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic Hdm2 expression (P < 0.001). Subcellular ARF expression was not associated with clinicopathological parameters, and although not an independent prognosticator, these preliminary findings suggest that cytoplasmic p14ARF might be associated with a better overall survival (P = 0.09; log rank). The association between HER-2 positivity and nuclear p14ARF (P = 0.038), as well as nuclear Hdm2 (P = 0.019), reflects the in vitro findings of HER-2 interaction with the ARF/Hdm2 pathway. Cytoplasmic p53 and Hdm2 expression might have biological implications, through an association of cytoplasmic p53 with increased tumour proliferation (P = 0.005), and an improved overall survival (P = 0.002, log rank) in cytoplasmic Hdm2-expressing tumours, that independently predict favourable overall survival (P = 0.02) and disease-free survival (P = 0.03).;Nuclear p14ARF expression is similar in IDCs and DCIS and is associated with Hdm2 immunoreactivity.

To elucidate the role of human DMP1 (hDMP1) in breast cancer, one hundred and ten pairs of human breast cancer specimen were studied for the alterations of the hDMP1-ARF-Hdm2-p53 pathway with follow up of clinical outcomes. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the hDMP1 locus was found in 42% of human breast carcinomas, while that of INK4a/ARF and p53 were found in 20 and 34%, respectively. Hdm2 amplification was found in 13% of the same sample, which was found independently of LOH for hDMP1. Conversely, LOH for hDMP1 was found in mutually exclusive fashion with that of INK4a/ARF and p53, and was associated with low Ki67 index and diploid karyotype. Consistently, LOH for hDMP1 was associated with luminal A category and longer relapse-free survival, while that of p53 was associated with non-luminal A and shorter survival. Thus, loss of hDMP1 could define a new disease category associated with prognosis of breast cancer patients. Human breast epithelial cells/cancer cells with wild-type p53 were sensitive to growth inhibition by activated Dmp1:ER while those that delete p14(ARF) or p53, and/or Hdm2 amplification showed partial or nearly complete resistance, indicating that p53 is a critical target for hDMP1 to exhibit its biological activity.",

It is thus important to intervene at a key step of metastatic process, such as angiogenesis, for effective breast cancer treatment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis. Because degree of tumor malignancy directly correlates with the expression of VEGF but inversely correlates with the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16, we examined whether restoration of p16 in breast cancer cells that lack p16 expression would modulate VEGF expression, and if so, how are the effects of p16 expression on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. To facilitate induction of p16 expression, a recombinant adenovirus expressing p16 (AdRSVp16) was used to transduce breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and JygMC(A). This study showed that adenoviral-mediated p16 expression downregulated VEGF gene expression in breast cancer cells, inhibited breast cancer cell-induced angiogenesis, and suppressed breast tumor metastasis in a spontaneous metastasis model in mice.

Hypoxia stimulates tumor malignant progression and induces HIF-1α. Because p16 neutralizes effect of HIF-1α and attenuates tumor metastatic progression, we intended to investigate whether p16 directly affects one or more aspects of the malignant process such as adhesion and migration of breast cancer cells. To approach this aim, MDA-MB-231 and other breast cancer cells stably transfected with Tet-on inducible p16 were used to study the p16 effect on growth, adhesion and migration of the cancer cells. We found that p16 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, but has no apparent effect on cell adhesion. Importantly, p16 inhibits hypoxia-induced cell migration in breast cancer in parallel with its inhibition of HIF-1α transactivation activity. This study suggests that p16's ability to suppress tumor metastasis may be partially resulted from p16's inhibition on cell migration, in addition to its known functions on inhibition of cell proliferation, angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis.",

The present study examined the mRNA expression of these genes by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the inactivation mechanisms that alter these levels, in 100 primary breast carcinomas. Furthermore, the interdependence of these mechanisms was examined, since it has been reported that p14ARF is altered in most tumours in concordance with p16INK4a. The results show that promoter hypermethylation, tested by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), was the major mechanism of inactivation of these genes and was present in 31 (31%) and 50 (50%) of the tumours that showed decreased p16INK4a and p14ARF expression, respectively. Hemizygous deletion was the second cause of down-regulation. Homozygous deletion was rare and mutation was absent. In most tumours overexpressing p16INK4a or p14ARF, no detectable inactivation mechanisms were observed. Finally, the results indicate that these proteins are often co-altered in primary breast tumours and that p16INK4a and p14ARF had non-independent behaviour, since they were silenced or overexpressed concomitantly with a significant correlation (p < 0.05).",

Broussoflavonol B induced cell cycle arrest at both the G₀/G₁ and G₂/M phases accompanied by a downregulation of c-Myc protein, a upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitory proteins p16(INK4a), p19(INK4D) and p21(WAF1/CIP1) and a down-regulation of the expression levels of the G₂/M regulatory proteins such as cyclin B1, cdc2 and cdc25C.

Fifteen (7.9%) specimens showed strong expression, 75 (39.3%) moderate, 55 (28.8%) weak expression and 46 (24.1%) cases no expression of Id-1. Patients with strong or moderate Id-1 expression had a significant shorter overall (p = 0.003, Cox regression) and disease-free survival (p = 0.01, Cox regression) compared to those with absent or low expression.

Besides, more and more studies show that some other molecular markers in breast cancer, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, p14ARF, and Her2/neu can regulate this passway unneglectedly.

Tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed with 406 cases of breast cancer. The cases were subgrouped into luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) based on the results of immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR, HER-2, and Ki-67 and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER-2. One hundred and sixty-eight cases were allocated to the subgroup luminal A; 87 cases to the luminal B; 32 cases to the HER-2; and 119 cases to the TNBC. The TNBC group showed the highest negative rate for p16, and the luminal B and HER-2 groups showed the highest positive rate for p16 (P < 0.001). Alteration of p16 was the highest in the luminal B and HER-2 groups, and pRB expression rate was the highest in the HER-2 group and lowest in the luminal A group. In addition, p16(+)/pRB(+) type was the most common in the luminal B group, p16(+)/pRB(-) in the luminal A group, and p16(-)/pRB(+) in the TNBC group (P < 0.001). Altered p16/pRB(+) and non-altered p16/pRB(+) type was the most common in the luminal B, and altered p16/pRB(-) and non-altered p16/pRB(+) type was the most common in the luminal A (P < 0.001). Alteration of p16 was correlated with higher Ki67 labeling index (LI) (P = 0.013), and p16 negativity was correlated with ER negativity (P = 0.002), PR negativity (P = 0.004), and higher Ki67 LI (P < 0.001). pRB positivity was correlated with PR negativity (P = 0.009), HER-2 positivity (P = 0.001), and higher Ki-67 LI (P < 0.001). In luminal group A, p16 alteration was correlated with shorter DFS in univariate analysis (P = 0.024).

To identify predictors of response, we determined the in vitro sensitivity to PD 0332991 across a panel of molecularly characterized human breast cancer cell lines.;Forty-seven human breast cancer and immortalized cell lines representing the known molecular subgroups of breast cancer were treated with PD 0332991 to determine IC50 values. These data were analyzed against baseline gene expression data to identify genes associated with PD 0332991 response.;Cell lines representing luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtype (including those that are HER2 amplified) were most sensitive to growth inhibition by PD 0332991 while nonluminal/basal subtypes were most resistant. Analysis of variance identified 450 differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells. pRb and cyclin D1 were elevated and CDKN2A (p16) was decreased in the most sensitive lines. Cell cycle analysis showed G0/G1 arrest in sensitive cell lines and Western blot analysis demonstrated that Rb phosphorylation is blocked in sensitive lines but not resistant lines. PD 0332991 was synergistic with tamoxifen and trastuzumab in ER+ and HER2-amplified cell lines, respectively.

The exact role of the two proteins encoded by this complex locus in this predisposition is unclear. Most mutations affect either CDKN2A only or products of both genes. Recently a deletion affecting ARF-specific exon 1beta was reported in a family with melanoma and neural tumours. However, the possibility of this deletion also altering the CDKN2A transcript could not be excluded. More convincingly, a 16 base pair insertion in exon 1beta has been reported in an individual with multiple melanomas suggesting a direct role for ARF in melanoma predisposition. We report here a splice mutation in exon 1beta in a family with melanoma that results in ARF haploinsufficiency. The mutation was observed in a mother and daughter with melanoma. A sibling of the mother with breast cancer also had this mutation. Analysis of the melanoma from one individual revealed a 62 bp deletion in exon 3 of the wildtype allele and loss of the mutant allele; these somatic changes would affect both CDKN2A and ARF. These somatic events suggest that concomitant inactivation of both ARF and CDKN2A may be necessary for melanoma development and that mutations in ARF and CDKN2A possibly confer different levels of susceptibility to melanoma, with the former associated with lesser predisposition. In this situation, the events follow a 'three-hit' model as observed in tumours from FAP patients with an attenuated phenotype. Overall, the data suggest a direct role for ARF haploinsufficiency in melanoma predisposition and co-operation between ARF and CDKN2A in tumour formation, consistent with recent observations in Cdkn2a-specific knockout mice.",

We hypothesize that epigenetic misregulation of cancer-related genes could partially account for this predisposition. We have performed methylation microarray analysis of peripheral blood DNA from 14 women with bilateral breast cancer compared with 14 unaffected matched controls throughout 17 candidate breast cancer susceptibility genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, ESR1, SFN, CDKN2A, TP53, GSTP1, CDH1, CDH13, HIC1, PGR, SFRP1, MLH1, RARB and HSD17B4. We show that the majority of methylation variability is associated with intragenic repetitive elements. Detailed validation of the tiled region around ATM was performed by bisulphite modification and pyrosequencing of the same samples and in a second set of peripheral blood DNA from 190 bilateral breast cancer patients compared with 190 controls. We show significant hypermethylation of one intragenic repetitive element in breast cancer cases compared with controls (P = 0.0017), with the highest quartile of methylation associated with a 3-fold increased risk of breast cancer (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.78-5.86, P = 0.000083). Increased methylation of this locus is associated with lower steady-state ATM mRNA level and correlates with age of cancer patients but not controls, suggesting a combined age-phenotype-related association. This research demonstrates the potential for gene-body epigenetic misregulation of ATM and other cancer-related genes in peripheral blood DNA that may be useful as a novel marker to estimate breast cancer risk.

The exploratory study cohort comprised 17 breast cancer patients with multiple benign and/or in situ lesions concurrently present with invasive carcinoma within a tumor biopsy. DNA from tumor tissue, normal breast epithelium when present, benign lesions (fibroadenoma, hyperplasia, papilloma, sclerosing adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia or atypical ductal hyperplasia), and in situ lesions of lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma were interrogated for promoter methylation status in 22 tumor suppressor genes using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA). Methylation specific PCR was performed to confirm hypermethylation detected by MS-MLPA. Promoter methylation was detected in 11/22 tumor suppressor genes in 16/17 cases. Hypermethylation of RASSF1 was most frequent, present in 14/17 cases, followed by APC in 12/17, and GSTP1 in 9/17 cases with establishment of an epigenetic monocloncal progression continuum to invasive breast cancer. Hypermethylated promoter regions in normal breast epithelium, benign, and premalignant lesions within the same tumor biopsy implicate RASSF1, APC, GSTP1, TIMP3, CDKN2B, CDKN2A, ESR1, CDH13, RARB, CASP8, and TP73 as early events.

Therefore, we investigated whether miRNA-29b, due to its complimentarity to the 3'- untranslated region of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and DNMT3B, could restore normal DNA methylation patterns in human breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that transfection of pre-miRNA-29b into less aggressive MCF-7 cells, but not MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal cells, inhibited cell proliferation, decreased DNMT3A and DNMT3B messenger RNA (mRNA), and decreased promoter methylation status of ADAM23 , CCNA1, CCND2, CDH1, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, HIC1, RASSF1, SLIT2, TNFRSF10D, and TP73 tumor-suppressor genes. Using methylation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and real-time PCR, we also demonstrated that the methylation status of several critical tumor-suppressor genes increased as stage of breast disease increased, while miRNA-29b mRNA levels were significantly decreased in breast cancers versus normal breast. This increase in methylation status was accompanied by an increase in DNMT1 and DNMT3B mRNA in advanced stage of human breast cancers and in MCF-7, MDA-MB-361, HCC70, Hs-578T, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as compared to normal breast specimens and MCF-10-2A, a non-tumorigenic breast cell line, respectively.

To clarify the association, we here quantified methylation levels of promoter CGIs of 11 genes, which are unlikely to confer growth advantage to cells, in 63 human breast cancers. The number of methylated genes in a cancer did not obey a bimodal distribution, and the 63 cancers were classified into those with frequent methylation (n = 16), moderate methylation (n = 26) and no methylation (n = 21). The incidence of HER2 amplification was significantly higher in the cancers with frequent methylation (11 of 16) than in those with no methylation (2 of 21, P = 0.001). Also, the number of methylated genes correlated with the degree of HER2 amplification (r = 0.411, P = 0.002). Correlation analysis with clinicopathological characteristics and methylation of CDKN2A, BRCA1 and CDH1 revealed that frequent methylation had significant correlation with higher nuclear grades (P = 0.001).

The frequency of p16 expression significantly decreased in moderately differentiated (histologic grade II) cancers, 20 (19.6%) of 102. In poorly differentiated cancers (histologic grade III), p16 expression was not observed in all 16 cases. p16 expression was significantly associated with histologic grade of the breast carcinomas (p < 0.001). The proliferative index (PI: S + G2/M) of individual tumors was measured by DNA flow cytometry. In 114 tumors with PI less than 20%, p16 expression was observed in 59 tumors (49.1%). In the tumors with PI equal or more than 20%, p16 expression was observed in 22 (28.2%) of 78 cases. p16 expression was significantly decreased in the tumor with higher PI (p =0.003). For the other clinicopathologic variables, no significant association was found with p16 expression status. Immunohistochemical assay for p53 protein expression was performed on the same breast carcinomas. There was no significant association between p16 and p53 expression in breast carcinomas. During median follow-up period of 52 months (range: 40-72 months), 46 patients (25.8%) had recurrent disease and 32 patients (18.91%) died of recurrent disease. p16 expression was observed in 20 (43.5%) of 46 patients with recurrent disease, while its expression was observed in 58 patients (39.7%) of 146 patients who were free of recurrence during the study period. p16 expression had no significant impact on predicting recurrence of breast carcinoma. Fourteen patients (12.2%) of 114 patients whose tumors did not show p16 expression died of recurrent breast carcinoma, whereas 18 patients (23.1%) of 78 patients with p16 expressing tumor died during the follow-up period. There was a significant difference of patient survival according to p16 expression status (p = 0.039). These results indicate that p16 expression is useful in predicting response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. p16 protein seems to have a role in tumor growth and differentiation of the breast carcinoma.",

To understand the role of miRNAs in this molecular complexity, we performed miRNA expression analysis in a cohort of molecularly well-characterized human breast cancer cell lines to identify miRNAs associated with the most common molecular subtypes and the most frequent genetic aberrations.;Using a microarray carrying LNA™ modified oligonucleotide capture probes), expression levels of 725 human miRNAs were measured in 51 breast cancer cell lines. Differential miRNA expression was explored by unsupervised cluster analysis and was then associated with the molecular subtypes and genetic aberrations commonly present in breast cancer.;Unsupervised cluster analysis using the most variably expressed miRNAs divided the 51 breast cancer cell lines into a major and a minor cluster predominantly mirroring the luminal and basal intrinsic subdivision of breast cancer cell lines. One hundred and thirteen miRNAs were differentially expressed between these two main clusters. Forty miRNAs were differentially expressed between basal-like and normal-like/claudin-low cell lines. Within the luminal-group, 39 miRNAs were associated with ERBB2 overexpression and 24 with E-cadherin gene mutations, which are frequent in this subtype of breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, 31 miRNAs were associated with E-cadherin promoter hypermethylation, which, contrary to E-cadherin mutation, is exclusively observed in breast cancer cell lines that are not of luminal origin. Thirty miRNAs were associated with p16INK4 status while only a few miRNAs were associated with BRCA1, PIK3CA/PTEN and TP53 mutation status. Twelve miRNAs were associated with DNA copy number variation of the respective locus.;Luminal-basal and epithelial-mesenchymal associated miRNAs determine the subdivision of miRNA transcriptome of breast cancer cell lines. Specific sets of miRNAs were associated with ERBB2 overexpression, p16INK4a or E-cadherin mutation or E-cadherin methylation status, which implies that these miRNAs may contribute to the driver role of these genetic aberrations. Additionally, miRNAs, which are located in a genomic region showing recurrent genetic aberrations, may themselves play a driver role in breast carcinogenesis or contribute to a driver gene in their vicinity. In short, our study provides detailed molecular miRNA portraits of breast cancer cell lines, which can be exploited for functional studies of clinically important miRNAs.",

Recent studies indicate that inhibiting DNMT1 protein expression may be a useful approach for understanding the role of DNA methylation in tumorigenesis. To this end, we used RNA interference to specifically down-regulate DNMT1 protein expression in NCI-H1299 lung cancer and HCC1954 breast cancer cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DNMT1 protein expression resulted in >80% reduction of promoter methylation in RASSF1A, p16(ink4A), and CDH1 in NCI-H1299; and RASSF1A, p16(ink4A), and HPP1 in HCC1954; and re-expression of p16(ink4A), CDH1, RASSF1A, and SEMA3B in NCI-H1299; and p16(ink4A), RASSF1A, and HPP1 in HCC1954. By contrast, promoter methylation and lack of gene expression was maintained when these cell lines were treated with control small interfering RNAs. The small interfering RNA treatment was stopped and 17 days later, all of the sequences showed promoter methylation and gene expression was again dramatically down-regulated, indicating the tumor cells still were programmed for these epigenetic changes. We saw no effects on soft agar colony formation of H1299 cells 14 days after DNMT1 knockdown indicating that either these genes are not functioning as tumor suppressors under these conditions, or that more prolonged knockdown or other factors are also required to inhibit the malignant phenotype. These results provide direct evidence that loss of DNMT1 expression abrogates tumor-associated promoter methylation and the resultant silencing of multiple genes implicated in the pathogenesis of human lung and breast cancer.",

Triple-matched samples (cancerous tissues, matched adjacent normal tissues and serum samples) from breast cancer patients were screened for TP53 mutations, and the promoter methylation profile of P14(ARF), MDM2, TP53 and PTEN genes was analyzed as well as mtDNA alterations, including D-loop mutations and mtDNA content. In the studied cohort, no mutation was found in TP53 (DNA-binding domain). Comparison of P14(ARF) and PTEN methylation patterns showed significant hypermethylation levels in tumor tissues (P < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively) whereas the TP53 tumor suppressor gene was not hypermethylated (P < 0.511). The proportion of PTEN methylation was significantly higher in serum than in the normal tissues and it has a significant correlation to tumor tissues (P < 0.05). mtDNA analysis revealed 36.36% somatic and 90.91% germline mutations in the D-loop region and also significant mtDNA depletion in tumor tissues (P < 0.01). In addition, the mtDNA content in matched serum was significantly lower than in the normal tissues (P < 0.05).

Individual-gene performances showed sensitivities of 63-79 %, 53-84 % specificities, positive predictive values of 59-83 % and negative predictive values of 63-80 %. When modelled together, these seven genes reached a sensitivity of 93 %, 100 % specificity, a positive predictive value of 100 % and a negative predictive value of 93 %, with high statistical power. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering independently confirmed these findings, in close agreement with the accuracy measurements.

As expected, stimulation of Bmi1 expression could also be achieved in ERα-restored MDA-MB-231 cells, and at the same time depletion of ERα decreased expression of Bmi1.

Furthermore, Wip1-overexpressing tumors exhibited no or low levels of p16, which normally accumulates upon p38 MAPK activation (P = 0.057). Loss of p16 expression was not associated with hypermethylation of its promoter or loss of heterozygosity on 9p21. Among the 135 primary breast carcinomas further examined, a significant association was found between the Wip1 overexpression and negative staining for p53 (P value = 0.057), indicating that the tumors are wild-type for p53. This is first report showing that Wip1 overexpression abrogates the homeostatic balance maintained through the p38-p53-Wip1 pathway, and contributes to malignant progression by inactivating wild-type p53 and p38 MAPK as well as decreasing p16 protein levels in human breast tissues.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The INK4a and ARF genes found at the CDKN2A locus are key effectors of cellular senescence that is believed to act as a powerful anticancer mechanism. Accordingly, mutations in these genes are present in a wide variety of spontaneous human cancers and CDKN2A germ line mutations are found in familial melanoma. The TBX2 gene encoding a key developmental transcription factor is amplified in pancreatic cancer cell lines and preferentially amplified and overexpressed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated breast tumors. Overexpression of Tbx2 and the related factor Tbx3, which is also overexpressed in breast cancer and melanomas, can suppress senescence in defined experimental systems through repression of ARF expression. However, it is not known how Tbx2 mediates its repressive effect nor whether endogenous Tbx2 or Tbx3 perform a similar antisenescence function in transformed cells. This is a particularly important question because the loss of CDKN2A in many human cancers would, in principle, bypass the requirement for Tbx2/3-mediated repression of ARF in suppressing senescence. We show here that Tbx2 is overexpressed in melanoma cell lines and that Tbx2 targets histone deacetylase 1 to the p21Cip1 (CDKN1A) initiator. Strikingly, expression of an inducible dominant-negative Tbx2 (dnTbx2) leads to displacement of histone deacetylase 1, up-regulation of p21(Cip1) expression, and the induction of replicative senescence in CDKN2A-null B16 melanoma cells. In human melanoma cells, expression of dnTbx2 leads to severely reduced growth and induction of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. The results suggest that the activity of endogenous Tbx2 is critically required to maintain proliferation and suppress senescence in melanomas.",

Prognosis was estimated by also adding tumor size, lymph node status, distant metastases and hormone receptor status at diagnosis into a Cox proportional hazard model. Excluding mutations carriers, a horizontal family history (5% of all cases) was significantly associated with tubular tumor type [OR = 3.87(1.44-10.41)].

However, germline mutation carriers (BRCA1/2, TP53 or CDKN2A, present in 0.95% of the cases) had a significantly worse survival.

Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a transcription/translation factor that promotes the formation of tumors in transgenic mice; however, the underlying molecular events are not understood. To explore this in a human model system, YB-1 was expressed in mammary epithelial cells under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. The induction of YB-1 promoted phenotypes associated with malignancy in three-dimensional breast acini cultures. This was attributed to YB-1 enhancing the expression and activity of the histone acetyltransferase p300 leading to chromatin remodeling. Specifically, this relaxation of chromatin allowed YB-1 to bind to the BMI1 promoter. The induction of BMI1 engaged the Polycomb complex resulting in histone H2A ubiquitylation and repression of the CDKN2A locus. These events manifested functionally as enhanced self-renewal capacity that occurred in a BMI1-dependent manner. Conversely, p300 inhibition with anacardic acid prevented YB-1 from binding to the BMI1 promoter and thereby subverted self-renewal. Despite these early changes, full malignant transformation was not achieved until RSK2 became overexpressed concomitant with elevated human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) activity. The YB-1/RSK2/hTERT expressing cells formed tumors in mice that were molecularly subtyped as basal-like breast cancer. We conclude that YB-1 cooperates with p300 to allow BMI1 to over-ride p16(INK4a) -mediated cell cycle arrest enabling self-renewal and the development of aggressive breast tumors.",

Tumour cell lines were also subjected to polymerase chain reaction-single strand polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing. The results were compared with established prognostic parameters, DNA flow cytometry and p53 protein expression. In 33 (9%) invasive and two (4%) intraductal carcinomas, a cytoplasmic accumulation of the p16 protein was seen. These cases were characterized by poor histological grade of differentiation, loss of of oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors and frequent overexpression of the p53 protein. In addition, breast carcinomas with aberrant p16 expression demonstrated a high proliferative activity, with median S-phase fractions 74% higher than in the control group and the median Ki67 fractions elevated to 75%. A genetic alteration of the p16 gene was not detectable in three analysed cell lines with cytoplasmic p16 expression applying PCR-SSCP and direct DNA sequencing.

Polymerase chain Reaction (PCR) was used to amplify two genes encoding for EBV viral proteins. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus and its cellular localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) for Epstein-Barr encoded small RNAs (EBERs). Given the reported low frequency of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Sudanese breast cancer patients, the methylation status of six tumor suppressor genes was investigated using methylation specific PCR. EBV genome was detected in 55.5% (n = 90) of breast cancer tissues as compared to 23% in control tissue samples (p = 0.0001). Using ISH, EBV signal was detected in all 18 breast cancer biopsies examined while all five normal breast tissue biopsies tested were negative for EBV. Of six tumour suppressor genes investigated BRCA1, BRCA2, and p14 appeared to be under strong epigenetic silencing.In conclusion, we present evidence of a strong association between EBV and breast carcinoma in Sudanese patients, and considerable epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors that may likely be an outcome or an association with viral oncogenesis.

GASC1 is a histone demethylase involved in the deregulation of histone methylation in cancer cells. In the current study, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the genes in the 9p24 amplicon in human breast cancer. We performed extensive genomic analyses on a panel of cancer cell lines and narrowed the shortest region of overlap to approximately 2 Mb. Based on statistical analysis of copy number increase and overexpression, the 9p24 amplicon contains six candidate oncogenes. Among these, four genes (GASC1 UHRF2, KIAA1432 and C9orf123) are overexpressed only in the context of gene amplification while two genes (ERMP1 and IL33) are overexpressed independent of the copy number increase. We then focused our studies on the UHRF2 gene, which has a potential involvement in both DNA methylation and histone modification. Knocking down UHRF2 expression inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells specifically with 9p24 amplification. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of UHRF2 in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells promoted cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UHRF2 has the ability to suppress the expression of key cell-cycle inhibitors, such as p16(INK4a), p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Taken together, our studies support the notion that the 9p24 amplicon contains multiple oncogenes that may integrate genetic and epigenetic codes and have important roles in human tumorigenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Aneuploid cells should have a reduced proliferation rate due to difficulty in proceeding through mitosis. However, contrary to this, high aneuploidy is associated with aggressive tumour growth and poor survival prognosis, in particular in triploid breast cancer. A further paradox revolves around the observation that, while cell senescence should inhibit proliferation, the senescence marker p16INK4a correlates with poor treatment outcome in patients with a very aggressive triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC). In this study, we aim to pour light on the possible relationship of these conundrums with polyploidy of tumour cells. We performed detailed analysis of DNA histogram profiles in diagnostic core biopsies of 30 cases of operable breast cancer and found that near triploidy in TNBC and other forms correlated with weak or no response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) as scored by Miller-Payne index. Polyploid cells in operation samples from tumours that were non-responsive to NAC treatment were Ki67 and CD44 positive. In addition, polyploid cells were positive for markers of embryonic stemness (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG) and senescence (p16INK4a). The relationship patterns between p16INK4a and NANOG were heterogeneous, with predominantly mutually exclusive expression but also synergistic and intermediate variants in the same samples. We conclude that the aneuploidy and senescence paradoxes can be explained by the mutual platform of polyploidy, conferring genomic and epigenetic instability as a survival advantage. Such cells are able to bypass aneuploidy restrictions of conventional mitosis and overcome the barrier of senescence by a shift to self-renewal, resulting in progression of cancer. ",

To test this assumption, we have examined the effects of DAC in two human cancer cell lines of differing INK4a/ARF promoter methylation status: MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in which INK4a/ARF is unmethylated and normally expressed, and DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells in which INK4a/ARF is methylated and repressed. In MDA-MB-468 cells, DAC induces cytotoxicity in the absence of any detectable increase of p14 or p16 expression, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of p16/p14 expression fails to attenuate DAC cytotoxicity. In DLD-1 cells, DAC demethylates INK4a/ARF and restores both p16 and p14 expression at concentrations that fail to cause detectable growth inhibition or apoptosis; moreover, neither ARF nor INK4a transgene expression inhibits DLD-1 cell growth despite normalization of p14 and p16 expression. These data imply that neither of these cell lines depends on up-regulated expression of INK4a/ARF for DAC cytotoxicity. We propose that optimal anticancer use of this drug will await unambiguous identification of those DAC target genes primarily responsible for triggering growth inhibition, followed by clarification as to whether these upstream events are caused by hypomethylation or DNA damage.",

To determine the relationship of cell division cycle 7 protein expression with tumor phenotype, molecular features and prognosis, 2197 highly characterized breast carcinomas were analyzed on a tissue microarray. Detectable cell division cycle 7 expression was found in 1088 (57%) of breast cancer specimens and 228 (11.9%) exhibited a moderate or strong expression. High levels of cell division cycle 7 expression were significantly related to medullary histotype (P < .0001); high tumor grade (P < .0001); negative estrogen receptor status (P < .0001); high Ki67 expression level (P < .0001); p53 and p16 overexpression (P < .0001); and amplification of HER2 (P < .0001), c-myc (P < .0001), MDM2 (P = .043), CCND1 (P = .0084), and ESR1 (P = .0012) as well as with the number of amplified genes (P < .0001). There was also a tendency towards worse prognosis in cell division cycle 7 positive as compared to negative breast cancers. The relationship between cell division cycle 7 and number of amplifications was independent from tumor proliferation raising the possibility of a direct influence of cell division cycle 7 expression for amplification development. In conclusion, cell division cycle 7 is a replication associated protein with relationships to gene amplification and genomic instability in breast carcinomas. These data support the potential utility of newly developed small molecule cell division cycle 7 inhibitors as a therapeutic alternative in at least a subset of breast carcinomas.",

However, resistance to these agents remains a significant cause of treatment failure. We previously demonstrated that inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family tumor suppressors causes antiestrogen resistance in MCF-7 cells, a widely studied model of estrogen responsive human breast cancers. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which pRb inactivation leads to antiestrogen resistance. Cdk4 and cdk2 are two key cell cycle regulators that can phosphorylate and inactivate pRb, therefore we tested whether these kinases are required in cells lacking pRb function. pRb family members were inactivated in MCF-7 cells by expressing polyomavirus large tumor antigen (PyLT), and cdk activity was inhibited using the cdk inhibitors p16(INK4A) and p21(Waf1/Cip1). Cdk4 activity was no longer required in cells lacking functional pRb, while cdk2 activity was required for proliferation in both the presence and absence of pRb function. Using inducible PyLT cell lines, we further demonstrated that pRb inactivation leads to increased cyclin A expression, cdk2 activation and proliferation in antiestrogen arrested cells. These results demonstrate that antiestrogens do not inhibit cdk2 activity or proliferation of MCF-7 cells in the absence of pRb family function, and suggest that antiestrogen resistant breast cancer cells resulting from pRb pathway inactivation would be susceptible to therapies that target cdk2.",

In this study, we examined the promoter methylation of six genes (SFN, P16, hMLH1, HOXD13, PCDHGB7 and RASSF1a) in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from serum. We used a high-throughput DNA methylation assay (MethyLight) to examine serum from 749 cases including breast cancer patients, patients with benign breast diseases and healthy women. The six-gene methylation panel test achieved 79.6% and 82.4% sensitivity with a specificity of 72.4% and 78.1% in diagnosis of breast cancer when compared with healthy and benign disease controls, respectively. Moreover, the methylation panel positive group showed significant differences in the following independent variables: (a) involvement of family history of tumors; (b) a low proliferative index, ki-67; (c) high ratios in luminal subtypes. Additionally the panel also complemented some breast cancer cases which were neglected by mammography or ultrasound.

Although p53 is well documented in IR response, the signaling network causing p53 activation in chronic IR remains to be identified. Using breast carcinoma MCF+FIR cells that showed a transient radioresistance after exposure chronically to fractionated IR (FIR), the present study shows that the basal DNA binding and transcriptional activity of p53 was elevated by FIR. p53-controlled luciferase activity was strikingly induced ( approximately 7.9-fold) with little enhancement of p53/DNA binding activity ( approximately 1.3-fold). The phosphorylated p53 (Thr 55) was increased in the cytoplasm and nucleus of MCF+FIR but not in the sham-FIR control cells. On the contrary, the sham-FIR control MCF-7 cells showed a low p53 luciferase transcription ( approximately 3-fold) but a striking enhancement of p53/DNA binding (12-fold) after 5 Gy of IR. To determine the signaling elements regulating p53 activity, DNA microarray of MCF+FIR using sham-FIR MCF-7 cells as a reference demonstrated that the mRNA of p21, MDM2, and p14ARF was up-regulated. Time course Western blot analysis, however, showed no difference in p21 induction. In contrast, MDM2 that was absent in control cells and was predominantly induced by IR was not induced in MCF+FIR cells. In agreement with MDM2 inhibition, MDM2-inhibitory protein p14ARF was increased in MCF+FIR cells. In summary, these results demonstrate that up-regulation of p14ARF paralleled with MDM2 inhibition contributes to p53 accumulation in the nucleus and causes a high responsiveness of p53 in chronic IR-treated breast cancer cells.",

AAV2-induced death occurred via targeting pathways of apoptosis and necrosis. In contrast, normal human mammary epithelial cells were unaffected upon AAV2 infection. The current study characterizes AAV2 infection and subsequent death of the highly aggressive, triple-negative (ER(-)/PR(-)/HER2(-)) MDA-MB-435 cell line derived from metastatic human breast carcinoma. Monolayer MDA-MB-435 cultures infected with AAV2 underwent complete apoptotic cell death characterized by activation of caspases -7, -8, and -9 and PARP cleavage. Death was further correlated with active AAV2 genome replication and differential expression of viral non-structural proteins Rep78 and Rep52. Cell death coincided with increased entry into S and G 2 phases, upregulated expression of the proliferation markers Ki-67 and the monomeric form of c-Myc. Expression of the p16(INK4), p27(KIP1), p21(WAF1), and p53 tumor suppressors was downregulated, indicating marked S phase progression, but sharply contrasted with hypo-phosphorylated pRb. In parallel, MDA-MB-435 breast tumor xenografts which received intratumoral injections of AAV2 were growth retarded, displayed extensive areas of necrosis, and stained positively for c-Myc as well as cleaved caspase-8. Therefore, AAV2 induced death of MDA-MB-435 xenografts was modulated through activation of caspase-regulated death pathways in relation to signals for cell cycle controls. Our findings provide foundational studies for development of novel AAV2 based therapeutics for treating aggressive, triple-negative breast cancer types. ",

Supplementation with berberine or with the synthetic derivatives NAX012, NAX013, NAX014, and NAX035 exerted a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of SK-BR-3 cell viability, with a greater effectiveness of NAX012 and NAX014 compounds with respect to berberine.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify novel drugs that can efficiently kill HER2(+) BC and/or potentiate the effect of existing anti-HER2 therapies. We performed a lenti-viral shRNA kinome screen on non-adherent mouse Her2/Neu tumorspheres and identified TBK1, a non-canonical IκB kinase (IKK), as the most potent target [1]. TBK1 knock-down, or treatment with TBK1-II, a drug that efficiently inhibits TBK1 and its close relative IKKε (IKBKE), suppressed growth of human HER2(+) BC cells and induced cellular senescence. Senescence was associated with inhibition of phosphorylated/active p65-NFkB and induction of the cell cycle inhibitor, p16(ink4a). In addition, TBK1-II cooperated with lapatinib, a EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, to accelerate apoptosis in vitro and suppress tumor growth in a xenograft model of HER2(+) BC. Thus, TBK1/IKKε inhibitors may improve treatment of HER2(+) BC in cooperation with anti-HER2 therapy. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Deregulation of the cell cycle by abnormal expression of one or several cell cycle regulatory proteins is a common finding in malignant tumors and might be a prerequisite for cancer development. Telomerase activity is an immortalization marker that is found in most cancers and for which an association with an active cell cycle has been implicated. In the tissue of 106 human breast carcinomas, we analyzed the relationship between telomerase activity levels and defects in the cell cycle machinery with a focus on the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway(s). The fraction of telomerase-positive tumors was 85%, and large differences in telomerase activity were found. Overexpression of cyclin D1 and/or cyclin E, in combination with a normal pRB, was a typical feature of tumors with high telomerase activity levels. Down-regulation of p16INK4 was not related per se to telomerase activity, but tumors with low p16INK4 in combination with cyclin D1 or E overexpression demonstrated high activity. Tumor cell proliferation, determined by Ki-67 expression, correlated significantly to telomerase activity levels. There was, however, not a strict association between proliferation rate and telomerase activity, because tumors with inactivated pRB had the highest Ki-67 fractions but intermediate telomerase activity. Also, cyclin D1 overexpression was associated with high telomerase levels without an increase in tumor cell proliferation. The present study indicates that telomerase activation occurs preferentially in breast cancers with certain cell cycle regulatory defects and that telomerase activity levels may depend on the specific defect(s).",

However, the mechanisms underlying E1A-mediated chemosensitization are still not fully understood. Recent studies demonstrate that E1A-mediated sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis can occur via multiple pathways; some of which depend on the expression of functional p53 and/or p19ARF proteins, while some are not. In human breast cancer cells with Her-2/neu overexpression, which usually are more resistance to anti-cancer drugs than cells without Her-2/ neu overexpression, may be sensitized through E1A-mediated downregulation of Her-2/neu. Alternatively, E1A can induce sensitization to anticancer drugs in cancer cells or normal diploid fibroblast cells through upregulating the expression of caspase proenzymes, or downregulating the activity of a critical survival factor Akt and/or upregulating the activities of a pro-apoptotic kinase p38 and a protein phosphatase PP2A, etc. This review summarizes these progresses and proposes a plausible feed-forward model for E1A-mediated chemosensitization in human breast cancer cells.",

We have measured allelic imbalance in genomic DNA from the breast cancer cell lines T47D, MDA-MB-231, two antiestrogen sensitive (MCF7N and MCF7L) and two resistant MCF7 cell lines (MMU2 and LCC9) using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) oligonucleotide microarrays. DNA from MCF7(L) and MMU2 cells was also analysed by comparative genome hybridisation (CGH) to compare with SNP microarray data. Proteins previously determined to be involved in disease progression were quantified by Western blot and compared to array data. The SNP and CGH array both detected cytogenetic abnormalities commonly found in breast cancer: amplification of chromosomes 11q13-14.1, 17q and 20q containing cyclin D1, BCAS1 and 3 (Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence) and AIB1 (Amplified in Breast cancer) genes; losses at 6q, 9p and X chromosomes, which included ERalpha (Estrogen Receptor alpha) and p16 ( INK4A ) genes. However the SNP chip array data additionally identified regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) followed by duplication of the remaining allele-uniparental disomy (UPD). Good concordance between SNP arrays and CGH analyses was observed, however there was poor correlation between gene copy number and protein levels between the cell lines. There were reductions in ERalpha, cyclin D1 and p27 protein levels whilst p21 protein levels were elevated in antiestrogen resistant MCF7 cell lines. Although protein levels varied there was no difference in gene copy number. This study shows SNP and CGH array analysis are powerful tools for analysis of allelic imbalance in breast cancer. However, the antiestrogen resistant phenotype was likely to be due to changes in gene expression and protein degradation rather than in altered gene copy number.",

The aim of this study is to relate the pattern of expression of multiple cancer genes known to undergo epigenetic inactivation by promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer with histologic and outcome data. We used immunohistochemistry to study expression of the tumor suppressor gene p16, estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, ERbeta, progesterone receptor (PR), and the DNA repair gene MGMT (O6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) in a panel of 200 breast cancers. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm MGMT promoter methylation. Loss of expression of MGMT, ERalpha, ERbeta, PR, and p16 was observed in 19%, 24%, 13%, 40%, and 50% of cases, respectively. A significant correlation was seen between grade III tumor and loss of expression of ERalpha, ERbeta, PR (all P < .0001), and MGMT (P = .04), whereas loss of expression of p16 was associated with grades I and II tumors (P < .001). Cases that expressed 3 or less of the 5 proteins studied had significantly reduced survival (P = .0016). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in a subset of 20 cancers showed DNA methylation associated with the loss of MGMT expression (P < .001). In conclusion, there is silencing of several key genes in breast cancer affecting molecular pathways involved in cell immortalization, DNA repair, and hormonal regulation, and this correlates significantly with risk of cancer-specific death. This expression profile could be linked to epigenetic events, and if so, these pathways have potential as targets for therapeutic strategies based on reversal of epigenetic silencing.",

In this study we show that TBX2 drives proliferation in breast cancer cells and this is abrogated after TBX2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or after the expression of a dominant-negative TBX2 protein. Using microarray analysis we identified a large cohort of novel TBX2-repressed target genes including the breast tumour suppressor NDRG1 (N-myc downregulated gene 1). We show that TBX2 targets NDRG1 through a previously undescribed mechanism involving the recruitment of early growth response 1 (EGR1). We show EGR1 is required for the ability of TBX2 to repress NDRG1 and drive cell proliferation. We show that TBX2 interacts with EGR1 and that TBX2 requires EGR1 to target the NDRG1 proximal promoter. Abrogation of either TBX2 or EGR1 expression is accompanied by the upregulation of cell senescence and apoptotic markers. NDRG1 can recapitulate these effects when transfected into TBX2-expressing cells. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism for TBX2-driven oncogenesis and highlight the importance of NDRG1 as a growth control gene in breast tissue.",

Mutational analysis of CDKN2 (p16) was performed to determine whether this gene was the target of such alterations. Of 21 tumors analyzed, only 1 showed a mutation of probable consequence, suggesting that CDKN2 appears not to be the target of loss of heterozygosity and indicating the possible existence of another tumor suppressor gene within this region. Additionally, since it has been suggested that some CDKN2 deletions and mutations could be due to an in vitro phenomenon, four immortal breast cell lines derived from normal epithelium, MCF10F, MCF12F, 184A1, and 184B5, were examined for loss or mutation of CDKN2. Two lines (MCF10F and MCF12F) showed homozygous deletions of CDKN2, and one (184A1) revealed a hemizygous deletion and a nonsense mutation in the remaining allele. This could imply an important role of CDKN2 in the control of immortalization or in vitro adaptation and is the first evidence of such in nontumor-derived cell lines.

For this purpose invasive and noninvasive tumor cell populations as well as hyperplastic cell proliferations were isolated from a series of archival breast tissue specimens (n = 57) using laser-assisted microdissection.

For RASSF1A and 14-3-3zeta promoter methylation was also demonstrated in epithelial hyperplasia and intraductal papillomas. By contrast, aberrant methylation of cyclinD2 and p16 was restricted to cancerous epithelium. Increased methylation of the cyclinD2 gene was significantly associated with a higher van Nuys grade. Furthermore, when intraductal and invasive tumor cells were compared, significant quantitative changes in the methylation level were detected primarily within the cyclinD2 gene.

METHODS: Individual-level incidence data were obtained from the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER) program. The county of residence of women with diagnosed breast cancer (n = 217,299) was used to link NPCR and SEER data with county-level measures of health care access from the 2004 Area Resource File (ARF). In addition to individual-level covariates such as age, race, and Hispanic ethnicity, we examined county-level covariates (residence in a Health Professional Shortage Area, urban/rural residence; race/ethnicity; and number of health centers/clinics, mammography screening centers, primary care physicians, and obstetrician-gynecologists per 100,000 female population or per 1000 square miles) as predictors of stage of breast cancer at diagnosis. RESULTS: Both individual-level and contextual variables are associated with later stage of breast cancer at diagnosis. Black women and women of \"other race\" had higher odds of receiving a diagnosis of regional or distant stage breast cancer (P <0.0001 and P = 0.02). With adjustment for age, Hispanics were more likely to receive a diagnosis of later stage breast cancer than non-Hispanics (P <0.0.001). Women living in areas with a higher proportion of black women had greater odds of receiving a diagnosis of regional or late stage breast cancer compared with women living in areas with the lowest proportion of black women. The same was noted for women living in areas with intermediate proportions of Hispanic women (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-0.97]. Other important contextual variables associated with stage at diagnosis included the percentage of persons living below the poverty level and the number of office-based physicians per 100,000 women. Women living in counties with a higher proportion of persons living below the poverty level or fewer office-based physicians were more likely to receive a diagnosis of later stage breast cancer than those living in other counties (P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, residence in areas with a higher proportion of non-Hispanic black women modified the associations of age and Hispanic ethnicity with later stage breast cancer (P = 0.0159 and P = 0.0002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that county-level contextual variables related to the availability and accessibility of health care providers and health services can affect the timeliness of breast cancer diagnosis.

Serum was obtained from women who were about to undergo a breast biopsy or mastectomy at three hospitals from 1977 to 1987 in Grand Rapids, MI USA. We compared the methylation status of 12 genes in serum DNA obtained from three groups of postmenopausal women (mean age at blood collection: 63.0 y; SD 9.9; range 35-91): breast cancer cases with lymph node-positive disease (n = 241); breast cancer cases with lymph node-negative disease (n = 63); and benign breast disease control subjects (n = 234). Overall, median levels of promoter methylation were low, typically below 5%, for all genes in all study groups. For all genes, median levels of methylation were higher (by 3.3 to 47.6%) in lymph node-positive breast cancer cases than in the controls. Comparing mean methylation level between lymph-node positive cases and controls, the most statistically significant findings, after adjustment of the false-positive rate (q-value), were for TWIST (p = 0.04), SFRP1 (p = 0.16), ESR1 (p = 0.17), P16 (p = 0.19) and APC (p = 0.19). For two of these four genes (TWIST, P16), the median methylation level was also highest in lymph-node positive cases, intermediate in lymph node-negative cases and lowest in the controls. The percent of study subjects with mean methylation scores ≥ 5% was higher among lymph node-positive cases than controls for ten genes, and significantly higher for HIN1 and TWIST (22.0 vs. 12.2%, p = 0.04 and 37.9 vs. 24.5%, p = 0.004, respectively). Despite relatively consistent variation in methylation patterns among groups, these modest differences did not provide sufficient ability to distinguish between cases and controls in a clinical setting.",

The panel of multiple TAAs was composed of six TAAs including Imp1, p16, Koc, survivin, cyclin B1, and c-myc full-length recombinant proteins. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect antibodies against these six TAAs in 49 sera from patients with breast cancer, 35 sera from patients with benign breast tumor, and 38 sera from normal individuals. Antibody frequency to any individual TAA in breast cancer was variable and ranged from 12.2 to 18.4%. With the successive addition of TAAs to a final total of six antigens, there was a stepwise increase of positive antibody reactions reaching a sensitivity of 67.3% and a specificity of 92.2% in breast cancer. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 8.52 and 0.36, respectively, which showed that the clinical diagnostic value of a parallel assay of six TAAs was high. Positive and negative predictive values were, respectively, 91.7 and 68.6%, indicating that the parallel assay of six TAAs raised the diagnostic accuracy greatly. Agreement rate and kappa value were 78.1% and 0.57, respectively, which indicated that the observed value of this assay had a middle range of coincidence with the actual value. The data from this study further support our previous hypothesis that the detection of autoantibodies for diagnosis of a certain type of cancer can be enhanced by using a panel of several carefully selected TAAs as target antigens and a panel of multiple TAAs would be a useful approach in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.",

Therefore, targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting tumor cells. To this end, we investigated the effect of the natural and pharmacologically safe molecule, caffeine, on CAF cells and their various procarcinogenic effects.;We have shown here that caffeine up-regulates the tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1, and reduces the expression/secretion of various cytokines (IL-6, TGF-β, SDF-1 and MMP-2), and down-regulates α-SMA. Furthermore, caffeine suppressed the migratory/invasiveness abilities of CAF cells through PTEN-dependent Akt/Erk1/2 inactivation. Moreover, caffeine reduced the paracrine pro-invasion/-migration effects of CAF cells on breast cancer cells. These results indicate that caffeine can inactivate breast stromal myofibroblasts. This has been confirmed by showing that caffeine also suppresses the paracrine pro-angiogenic effect of CAF cells through down-regulating HIF-1αand its downstream effector VEGF-A. Interestingly, these effects were sustained in absence of caffeine.;The present findings provide a proof of principle that breast cancer myofibroblasts can be inactivated, and thereby caffeine may provide a safe and effective prevention against breast tumor growth/recurrence through inhibition of the procarcinogenic effects of active stromal fibroblasts.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In breast cancers, only a minority of patients fully benefit from the different chemotherapy regimens currently in use. Identification of markers that could predict the response to a particular regimen would thus be critically important for patient care. In cell lines or animal models, tumor protein p53 (TP53) plays a critical role in modulating the response to genotoxic drugs. TP53 is activated in response to DNA damage and triggers either apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest, which have opposite effects on cell fate. Yet, studies linking TP53 status and chemotherapy response have so far failed to unambiguously establish this paradigm in patients. Breast cancers with a TP53 mutation were repeatedly shown to have a poor outcome, but whether this reflects poor response to treatment or greater intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor is unknown.;In this study we analyzed 80 noninflammatory breast cancers treated by frontline (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Tumor diagnoses were performed on pretreatment biopsies, and the patients then received six cycles of a dose-dense regimen of 75 mg/m(2) epirubicin and 1,200 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide, given every 14 days. After completion of chemotherapy, all patients underwent mastectomies, thus allowing for a reliable assessment of chemotherapy response. The pretreatment biopsy samples were used to determine the TP53 status through a highly efficient yeast functional assay and to perform RNA profiling. All 15 complete responses occurred among the 28 TP53-mutant tumors. Furthermore, among the TP53-mutant tumors, nine out of ten of the highly aggressive basal subtypes (defined by basal cytokeratin [KRT] immunohistochemical staining) experienced complete pathological responses, and only TP53 status and basal subtype were independent predictors of a complete response. Expression analysis identified many mutant TP53-associated genes, including CDC20, TTK, CDKN2A, and the stem cell gene PROM1, but failed to identify a transcriptional profile associated with complete responses among TP53 mutant tumors. In patients with unresponsive tumors, mutant TP53 status predicted significantly shorter overall survival. The 15 patients with responsive TP53-mutant tumors, however, had a favorable outcome, suggesting that this chemotherapy regimen can overcome the poor prognosis generally associated with mutant TP53 status.;This study demonstrates that, in noninflammatory breast cancers, TP53 status is a key predictive factor for response to this dose-dense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen and further suggests that the basal subtype is exquisitely sensitive to this association. Given the well-established predictive value of complete responses for long-term survival and the poor prognosis of basal and TP53-mutant tumors treated with other regimens, this chemotherapy could be particularly suited for breast cancer patients with a mutant TP53, particularly those with basal features.",

We performed high resolution mapping of the MCF10 series of cell lines to identify specific gene targets to elucidate the molecular correlates of immortalization, development, and progression of breast cancer at the level of individual genes.;We evaluated the initial untransformed outgrowths (MCF-10MS and MCF-10A) with six transformed cell lines with benign proliferations (MCF-10AT1, MCF-10AT1kcl2), carcinoma in situ (MCF-10CA1h cl13), and invasive carcinoma (MCF-10CA1h cl2, MCF-10CA1a cl1, MCF-10CA1d cl1). Losses and gains of loci at 112 unique human genome sites were interrogated using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MLPA).;Cytogenetic alterations in the four benign progenitors that persisted in the CIS and invasive cell lines corresponded to gains and losses of genes by MLPA. MCF-10MS had only normal gene copies. The untransformed MCF-10A had cytogenetic gain of 5q13-qter with corresponding gains of the IL3, IL4 and IL12B genes at 5q31-q33; gain of distal 19q12-qter was reflected in gains in KLK3 and BAX gene loci at 19q13-q13.4. The observed genic gain of cMYC at 8q24.12 was not indicated by cytogenetics. The apparently balanced t(3;9) component of the t(3;9)(p13;p22)t(3;5)(p26;q31) resulted in complete loss of the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes at 9p21. Additional clonal cytogenetic changes in the DCIS cell line (MCF-10A1h cl13) involving chromosomes 1, 3 and 10 persisted in the invasive progeny, with gain of corresponding genes at 1p13 (BCAR2, BCAR3, NRAS, TGFB2), at 3p12-13 (IL12A), and 3q21-27 (MME, PIK3CA, BCL6).;Our study adopted a comprehensive exploration of genetic changes using high resolution molecular probes applied to the MCF10 family of cell lines to identify individual genes in a continuum starting from normal breast epithelial cells and progressing through immortalization, transformation and invasive malignancy. Homozygous loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes and gain of MYC were initiating immortalization events.

To investigate the role of p16INK4a in tumor suppression and the potential interaction between p16INK4a and other cellular controlling elements, such as telomerase activity and DNA repair ability, the full-length of p16INK4a cDNA was cloned into a retroviral vector and introduced into human breast cancer MCF-7 cells that were previously demonstrated to harbor homozygous deletions of the p16INK4a gene. Stable expression of p16INK4a suppressed the malignant phenotype in MCF-7 cells, including cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, and the blockage of pRB phosphorylation. In addition, expression of p16INK4a suppressed telomerase activity and restored the telomere shortening process, and decreased cell DNA repair ability and sensitized cells to the DNA damage reagent. Our data suggest that the wild-type p16INK4a plays an important role in suppression of tumor malignancy, not only by inhibiting cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but also by inhibiting other cellular controlling mechanisms, such as telomerase activity and DNA repair capacity.",

A series of 68 human primary breast carcinomas was studied. Five cases were excluded from the study due to their lack of RB expression. In the remaining 63 cases the expression of cyclin D1, cdk4, cyclin E, and INK4a mRNA was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. The level of RB phosphorylated protein (ppRB) and p27 expression was immunohistochemically analyzed by measuring the percentage of stained cells (labeling index, LI). Cell proliferation rate was measured by Ki67 LI evaluation. The ppRB LI ranged from 5.2 to 73.8 and, as expected, was strongly related to the Ki67 LI (r=0.80; p<0.001). The expression of cyclin D1 mRNA, expressed in arbitrary units (a. u.), ranged from 1.15 to 123.0 and was inversely related to the ppRB LI (p=0.021) and Ki67 LI (p<0.001). Neither the cdk4 (range from 0.07 to 1.13 a. u.) nor the cyclin E (range from 0.13 to 9.27 a. u.) mRNA expression was significantly associated with the ppRB LI (p=0.962 and p=0.103, respectively).

Cyclin D1, cdk4, and cyclin E mRNA expressions were not significantly related to one another. In human primary breast cancers, the expression levels of the factors known to facilitate the cell cycle progression by RB protein phosphorylation were not positively related to ppRB-LI.

In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative effect of quercetin in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), which differed in hormone receptor. IC50 value (37μM) of quercetin showed significant cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells, which was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells even at 100μM of quercetin treatment. To study the response of cancer cells to quercetin, with respect to different hormone receptors, both the cell lines were treated with a fixed concentration (40μM) of quercetin. MCF-7 cells on quercetin treatment showed more apoptotic cells with G1 phase arrest. In addition, quercetin effectively suppressed the expression of CyclinD1, p21, Twist and phospho p38MAPK, which was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. To analyse the molecular mechanism of quercetin in exerting an apoptotic effect in MCF-7 cells, Twist was over-expressed and the molecular changes were observed after quercetin administration. Quercetin effectively regulated the expression of Twist, in turn p16 and p21 which induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, quercetin induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through suppression of Twist via p38MAPK pathway. ",

We have previously shown that ARF1 is overexpressed in highly invasive breast cancer cells and contribute to their enhanced migration. In this study, we propose to define the molecular mechanism by which ARF1 regulates this complex cellular response by investigating the role of this ARF GTPase on the activation process of Rac1, a Rho GTPase, associated with lamellipodia formation during cell migration. Here, we first show that inhibition of ARF1 or Rac1 expression markedly impacts the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to migrate upon EGF stimulation. However, the effect of ARF1 depletion can be reversed by overexpression of the Rac1 active mutant, Rac1 Q(61)L. Depletion of ARF1 also impairs the ability of EGF stimulation to promote GTP-loading of Rac1. To further investigate the possible cross-talk between ARF1 and Rac1, we next examined whether they could form a complex. We observed that the two GTPases could directly interact independently of the nature of the nucleotide bound to them. EGF treatment however resulted in the association of Rac1 with its effector IRSp53, which was completely abrogated in ARF1 depleted cells. We present evidences that this ARF isoform is responsible for the plasma membrane targeting of both Rac1 and IRSp53, a step essential for lamellipodia formation. In conclusion, this study provides a new mechanism by which ARF1 regulates cell migration and identifies this GTPase as a promising pharmacological target to reduce metastasis formation in breast cancer patients.

Azidothymidine (AZT) is being tested in several clinical trials as an enhancer of anticancer chemotherapy. However, the knowledge of the relationship between AZT and cellular pathways, e.g. p53 pathway, is very limited. In this study, we show that AZT, cisplatin (CDDP) and docetaxel (DTX) all induce unique molecular responses in OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma cells carrying a mutated p53, while in A2780, ovarian carcinoma and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells with wild type p53, all of these drugs cause similar p53 responses. We found that endogenous p14(ARF) protein in OVCAR-3 cells is down-regulated by DTX but induced by AZT and a short CDDP pulse treatment. In HT-29 colon carcinoma cells with a mutated p53, all treatments down-regulated p14(ARF) protein. Both CDDP and AZT increased the expression of p14ARF mRNA in OVCAR-3 cells. Differences in cell death induced by these drugs did not explain the differences in protein and mRNA expressions. No increase in the level of either c-Myc or H-ras oncoproteins was seen in OVCAR-3 cells after AZT or CDDP-treatment. These results suggest that p14(ARF) can respond to DNA damage without oncogene activation in cell lines without functional p53.",

Consistent with an important role for BRCA2 in error-free DNA repair, complex genomic changes are frequently observed in tumors derived from BRCA2 mutation carriers. Here, we explore the impact of DNA copy-number changes in BRCA2 tumors with respect to phenotype and clinical staging of the disease.;Breast tumors (n = 33) derived from BRCA2 999del5 mutation carriers were examined in terms of copy-number changes with high-resolution aCGH (array comparative genomic hybridization) containing 385 thousand probes (about one for each 7 kbp) and expression of phenotypic markers on TMAs (tissue microarrays). The data were examined with respect to clinical parameters including TNM staging, histologic grade, S phase, and ploidy.;Tumors from BRCA2 carriers of luminal and basal/triple-negative phenotypes (TNPs) differ with respect to patterns of DNA copy-number changes. The basal/TNP subtype was characterized by lack of pRb (RB1) coupled with high/intense expression of p16 (CDKN2A) gene products. We found increased proportions of Ki-67-positive cells to be significantly associated with loss of the wild-type (wt) BRCA2 allele in luminal types, whereas BRCA2wt loss was less frequent in BRCA2 tumors displaying basal/TNP phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that deletions at 13q13.1, involving the BRCA2wt allele, represents a part of a larger network of co-occurring genetic changes, including deletions at 6q22.32-q22.33, 11q14.2-q24.1, and gains at 17q24.1. Importantly, copy-number changes at these BRCA2-linked networking regions coincide with those associated with advanced progression, involving the capacity to metastasize to the nodes or more-distant sites at diagnosis.;The results presented here demonstrate divergent paths of tumor evolution in BRCA2 carriers and that deletion of the wild-type BRCA2 allele, together with co-occurring changes at 6 q, 11 q, and 17 q, are important events in progression toward advanced disease.",

These data suggest that cells that lack p16(INK4a) activity would be at high risk for breast cancer development and may exhibit an increased frequency of DNA methylation events in early cancer.;To test this hypothesis, the frequencies of INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation, as well as four additional selected loci, were tested in the initial random periareolar fine needle aspiration samples from 86 asymptomatic women at high risk for development of breast cancer, stratified using the Masood cytology index.;INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation was observed throughout all early stages of intraepithelial neoplasia and, importantly, in morphologically normal-appearing mammary epithelial cells; 29 of 86 subjects showed INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation in at least one breast. Importantly, INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation was not associated with atypia, and the frequency of hypermethylation did not increase with increasing Masood cytology score. The frequency of INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation was associated with the combined frequency of promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor-beta2, estrogen receptor-alpha, and breast cancer-associated 1 genes (P = 0.001).;Because INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation does not increase with age but increases with the frequency of other methylation events, we predict that INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation may serve as a marker of global methylation dysregulation.",

Previously, we showed that severe overexpression of cyclin E protein in tumor cells and tissues results in the appearance of lower molecular weight isoforms of cyclin E, which together with cdk2 can form a kinase complex active throughout the cell cycle. In this study, we report that one of the substrates of this constitutively active cyclin E/cdk2 complex is retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (pRb) in populations of breast cancer cells and tissues that also overexpress p16. In these tumor cells and tissues, we show that the expression of p16 and pRb is not mutually exclusive. Overexpression of p16 in these cells results in sequestering of cdk4 and cdk6, rendering cyclin D1/cdk complexes inactive. However, pRb appears to be phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle following an initial lag, revealing a time course similar to phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase retinoblastoma by cyclin E immunoprecipitates prepared from these synchronized cells. Hence, cyclin E kinase complexes can function redundantly and replace the loss of cyclin D-dependent kinase complexes that functionally inactivate pRb. In addition, the constitutively overexpressed cyclin E is also the predominant cyclin found in p107/E2F complexes throughout the tumor, but not the normal, cell cycle. These observations suggest that overexpression of cyclin E in tumor cells, which also overexpress p16, can bypass the cyclin D/cdk4-cdk6/p16/pRb feedback loop, providing yet another mechanism by which tumors can gain a growth advantage.",

In breast cancer patients, overexpression of cyclins D1 and E was associated with the presence of ER and stage respectively independently of other prognostic variables (multivariate analysis). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that only overexpression of cyclin E was associated with a longer recurrence-free survival.

The differentiation status of DAC-treated BCSCs was graded by changes in cell proliferation, CD44(+)CD24(-) phenotype, expression of tumor suppressor genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, p15, p16, p53, and PTEN, and antitumor drug resistance.;DAC treatment caused significant BCSC differentiation. BCSCs showed a 15%-23% reduction in proliferation capacity, 3.0%-21.3% decrease in the expression of BCSC marker CD44(+)/CD24(-), activation of p53 expression, and increased p15, p16, BRCA1, and BRCA2 expression. Concentrations of DAC ranging from 0.625 to 40 µM efficiently induce cell cycle arrest in S-phase. ABCG2, highly expressed in BCSCs, also decreased with DAC exposure. Of particular note, drug-sensitivity of BCSCs to doxorubicin, verapamil, and tamoxifen also increased 1.5-, 2.0-, and 3.7-fold, respectively, after pretreatment with DAC.;DAC reduced breast cancer cell survival and induced differentiation through reexpression of tumor suppressor genes.

Results form recent studies on the effect hERG1 inhibition in some breast cancer cells are controversial as it can lead to apoptosis or protect against cell death. Nevertheless, these data suggest that the hERG1 channel could have an important role in cancer biology. Here we report the effects of hyperstimulation of hERG1 channel in human mammary gland adenocarcinoma-derived cells. Application of the hERG1 activator, the diphenylurea derivative NS1643, inhibits cell proliferation irreversibly. This event is accompanied by a preferential arrest of the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase without the occurrence of apoptotic events. Consequently, cells responded to NS1643 by developing a senescence-like phenotype associated with increased protein levels of the tumor suppressors p21 and p16(INK4a) and by a positive β-galactosidase assay. These data suggest that prolonged stimulation of the hERG1 potassium channel may activate a senescence program and offers a compelling opportunity to develop a potential antiproliferative cancer therapy.",

The present study was undertaken to determine whether methylation of a set of growth-suppressor genes would correlate to the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs).;We used a pyrosequencing methylation analysis to study the methylation of 12 known growth-suppressor genes in 90 pairs of malignant/normal breast tissues. We also examined the expression of ERs and PRs in those specimens by immunohistochemistry. Mutations of p53 in tumor cells were detected by direct sequencing.;Twelve tumor-suppressor genes: ARHI, RASSF1A, HIN-1, RARbeta2, hMLH1, 14-3-3 sigma, RIZ1, p16, E-cadherin, RIL, CDH13, and NKD2 were selected for this methylation study. Five of them (RIL, HIN-1, RASSF1A, CDH13, and RARbeta2) were frequently methylated in breast cancers (57%, 49%, 58%, 44%, and 17%, respectively) but not the normal breast (0-4%). Two panels of methylation profiles were defined. The methylation of the HIN-1/RASSFIA panel strongly correlated to the expression of ERs, PRs, and hormone receptors (HRs; which were defined as 'positive' if ERs and/or PRs were positive; p < 0.001). Conversely, the methylation of the RIL/CDH13 panel strongly correlated to negative ER, PR, and HR expression (p = 0.001, 0.025, and 0.001, respectively). The subset of triple-negative breast cancers (in other words, those with negative ER, PR, and HER-2/neu status) was positively associated with the methylation of the RIL/CDH13 panel and negatively associated with the HIN-1/RASSF1A panel. Mutations of p53 were found in nine breast tumors (11%), seven of which lacked methylation in both panels.;We have defined two panels (HIN-1/RASSFIA, and RIL/CDH13) of methylation profiles, which correlated, either positively or negatively, to HR status.",

Measurement of telomere length could provide important information on cell replication and proliferation state in cancer tissues. Telomere shortening and its potential correlation with downregulation of cell-cycle regulatory elements were studied by the examination of relative telomere length and methylation status of the TP53, P21 and P16 promoters in tissues from breast cancer patients. Telomere length was measured in 104 samples (52 tumors and paired adjacent normal breast tissues) by quantitative PCR. Methylation profile of selected genes was analyzed in all samples using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Our results demonstrated a significant shortening of tumor telomere regions compared with paired adjacent normal tissues (P<0.001). Similarly, telomere lengths were significantly shorter in advanced stage cases and in those with higher histological grades (P<0.05). Telomere shortening in cancer tissues was correlated with a different level of hypermethylation in the TP53, P21 and P16 promoters (r=-0.33, P=0.001; r=-0.70, P<0.0001 and r=-0.71, P<0.0001, respectively). The results suggested that inactivation of p16/Rb and/or p53/p21 pathways by hypermethylation may be linked to critical telomere shortening, leading to genome instability and ultimately to malignant transformation. Thus, telomere shortening and promoter hypermethylation of related genes both might serve as breast cancer biomarkers.",

A characteristic of obesity is elevated circulating levels of adipocyte-derived hormone leptin. Evidence indicates that leptin plays an important role in mammary tumor formation; however, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Toward better defining the role of leptin in breast cancer, we describe the identification of leptin-regulated genes in hormone-responsive Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) human breast cancer cells using a microarray system. More than 64 leptin-regulated genes were identified including those for growth factors, cell cycle regulators, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and genes associated with metastasis. Cell cycle genes up-regulated by leptin include cyclins D and G, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, p21, p27, and p16. Leptin suppressed the expression of transforming growth factor-beta , a cell cycle suppressor. Determining the significance of this effect, treatment of MCF-7 cells with TGFB1 abrogated leptin-stimulated proliferation. Leptin up-regulated the expression of connective tissue growth factor, villin 2, and basigin, factors that are associated with ECM and are known to impact tumor growth. Finally, leptin induced the expression of anti-apoptotic genes BCL2 and survivin, and reduced the expression of apoptotic genes. The effect of leptin on MCF-7 survival was evaluated via TUNEL assay and demonstrated a sixfold reduction in apoptosis in leptin-treated cells, compared with controls. These data suggest leptin promotes mammary tumor growth through multiple mechanisms, including regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, and by modulating the extracellular environment. The identification of leptin-regulated genes begins to provide mechanistic links into the relationship between obesity and breast cancer incidence and morbidity.",

One of the issues is whether soy genistein has a genotoxic effect at physiological concentrations. To address this question using an in vitro model, we first established MCF-10A/G0 and MCF-10A/G1 cell lines, which were MCF-10A cells exposed to 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (as vehicle control), i.e., MCF-10A/G0, or 1 micromol/L of genistein for 3 months, MCF-10A/G1, respectively. Chromosomal changes were compared between the two cell lines by routine G-banded chromosome analyses and both regular and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. After 3 months of exposure to genistein, the cell line MCF-10A/G1 showed loss of a normal chromosome 8 and gain of an extra chromosome 20, as well as loss of a chromosomal segment on the short arm of chromosome 9, leading to a homozygous deletion of the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A (alias p16(INK4a)) and CDKN2B (alias p15(INK4b)).

We report here a clinical-epidemiological study, including the presence of additional neoplasias, in 14 apparently unrelated kindreds coming from a small geographic region of Northern Italy (Liguria), having therefore lived for generations in similar environmental conditions. We identified the common p16 missense mutation (Gly101Trp) reported in several previously studied kindreds, in 7 of 14 families, whereas the remaining 7 families had no detectable mutations in the coding region of p16 gene. Median age at diagnosis and other melanoma features were studied. When compared with the expected figures, based on regional incidence rates, a significant excess of pancreatic cancer, with 4 cases diagnosed, and of breast cancer, with 7 cases, was observed. The 7 families without apparent CDKN2A involvement were also negative for hot-spot exon 2 mutation of CDK4. Environmental factors do not appear to play a role in the excess of non-melanoma neoplasia in our families, as somewhat substantiated by the control group, composed of spouses and members of non-affected branches; they do not reveal any increased cancer incidence compared with the general population.

The wild-type 5'-UTR sequence, containing a reported SNP (c.-33G > C) and a known melanoma-predisposing mutation (c.-34G > T), was included as controls. Results revealed that the variants at -21 and -34 severely reduced the reporter activity. The variants at -56 and at -25&-180 exhibited a milder impact, while results with c.-67G > C were dependent on the plasmid type. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA indicated that the effects of the variants were mainly post-transcriptional. Using a bicistronic dual-luciferase reporter plasmid, we confirmed that c.-21C > T and c.-34G > T had a severe negative impact in both cell lines. We also applied a polysomal profiling technique to samples heterozygous for the 5'-UTR variants, including patient-derived lymphoblasts. Analysis of allelic imbalance indicated that in addition to the c.-21C > T variant, the c.-56T > G and c.-67G > C variants also reduced mRNA translation efficiency. Overall, our results suggest that the c.-21C > T sequence variant is a melanoma-predisposing mutation. The c.-25C > T&c.-180G > A and particularly the c.-56G > T variants showed a range of intermediate functional defects in the different assays, and were not observed in the control population.

The CDK 4/6 inhibitors are a novel class of therapeutics that target the CDK 4/6 kinases that promote transition through the cell cycle. Currently, palbociclib (PD0332991, Pfizer), abemaciclib (LY2835219, Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011, Novartis) are being investigated in clinical trials. These oral agents offer the hope of clinical efficacy in many tumor types, and have been associated with minimal toxicity. Amplification/overexpression of cyclin D, loss of CDKN2A (p16) and amplification/overexpression of CDK4 are proposed biomarkers of improved response to CDK4/6 inhibition.;Palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib have demonstrated very promising clinical activity in breast cancer, liposarcoma, mantel cell lymphoma and melanoma. Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promising preclinical activity in glioblastoma, renal and ovarian cancer models that may provide directions for their future clinical development.

For the tumor lacking hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor 2, some other mechanisms could be responsible. It seems that MicroRNA 22 directing some putative targets such as SIRT1, Sp1 and CDK6 plays a crucial role in breast tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, ribophorin and the associated molecules might be engaged in breast cancer stemness. Obviously, these molecules provide potential for therapeutic targets. It was also discussed about new drug development such as anti-human epidermal growth factor 2 therapy, anti-angiogenesis, pro-tumor aspects of anti-cancer therapy and application of circulating markers for monitoring, imaging and health-care system. Furthermore, we discussed risk factors, prevention and screening to reduce invasive cancers as well.

Our previous work demonstrates that cells lacking p16(INK4A) activity exhibit phenotypes associated with malignancy (Romanov et al. 2001). The acquisition of genomic instability occurs through the activation of telomeric and centrosomal dysfunction. Additionally, the activation of stress pathways such as COX-2 provides these cells with the mutagenic potential to survive adverse environments as well as the ability to migrate, evade apoptosis and immune surveillance, and summon sustaining vasculature. Examination of archived tissue from women with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) reveals epithelial cells that overexpress markers of premalignant stress activation pathways and mirror the distinctive expression patterns of these markers observed in vitro. These epithelial cells are found within the premalignant lesion as well as in the field of morphologically normal tissue that surrounds the lesion. Here, we show that p16(INK4A)-silenced vHMEC cells exhibit a gene expression profile which is distinct, reproducible, and extends beyond the changes mediated by p16(INK4A) inactivation. The present work suggests that cells lacking p16(INK4A) activity exhibit critical activities which allow cells to evade differentiation processes that would be expected to terminate proliferation. All of these properties are critical to malignancy. These events may be useful biomarkers to detect the earliest events in breast cancer.",

We will refer to them as upstream cancer-progression determinants (UCPDs, for brevity). MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-11, MMP-13, MMP-14, MMP-16, and MMP-19 are enhancers of cancer cell invasiveness and other traits of cancer progression, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We are interested in pathway links from UCPDs to gene expression of cancer cell MMPs in MDA-MB-231 cells. To test models about these links, wild-type copies of UCPDs were transiently overexpressed and then MMP mRNAs were measured by reverse transcription real-time PCR. The present results show that each of eight UCPDs is linked to the gene expression of a unique set of MMPs. This indicates that the effects are sequence-specific and that each UCPD reaches these MMP expressions through different sets of signaling pathways. We have detected 20 new pathway links, 11 are downregulatory and nine are upregulatory; 15 are new links in any cell, and five are new links in breast cancer. In seven links, three cancer-progression suppressing UCPDs unexpectedly enhance the gene expression of five cancer-progression promoting MMPs.",

Enhanced cell proliferation, as measured by Ki67 immunohistochemistry, is related to poor patient prognosis in many different tumor types. Ki67 expression shows considerable intratumoral heterogeneity. It is unclear if the TMA format is suitable for the analysis of potentially heterogeneous markers because of the small size of TMA spots. We have analyzed a breast cancer TMA containing 2,517 breast tissues, including 2,222 neoplastic and 295 normal or premalignant samples, for Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) and additional markers with a known relationship to Ki67 LI by immunohistochemistry (ER, PR, Bcl-2, Egfr, p16, p53) and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (HER2, MDM2, CCND1, MYC). A high Ki67 LI was linked to tumor phenotype including grade (p < 0.0001), stage (p < 0.0001), nodal stage (p = 0.0018), and patient prognosis (p < 0.0001), elevated protein levels of p53, p16 and Egfr, reduced levels of Bcl2, ER, and PR (p < 0.0001 each), as well as amplifications of HER2, MYC, CCND1 and MDM2 (p < 0.0001 each).

In all, 41 melanoma patients (stage I = 18; stage II = 10; stage III/IV = 13), 13 healthy controls without nevi, and 10 individuals with more than 15 nevi of >5 mm in size were investigated. For comparison, sera from patients with other skin tumors (nine basal cell cancers, five Kaposi's sarcoma), different metastasized cancers (five breast cancers, five colon cancers), and several chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 12) were also analyzed. In addition, we examined if methylation was involved in silencing transcription of these genes in 12 melanoma specimens. SOCS1, SOCS2, RASSF1a, CDKN2a, and MGMT were methylated in 75, 43, 64, 75, and 64% of melanoma samples, respectively. Of the 41 melanoma patients, 83% had one hypermethylated gene, while 66, 51, and 41% had two, three, or four hypermethylated genes, respectively. Also, 20% of these patients showed hypermethylation for all genes, while only 17% showed no methylation. Importantly, the methylation profile of the selected genes from melanoma patients was distinct from the other analyzed tumors. Transcription of SOCS1, SOCS2, CDKN2a, and RASSF1a genes was significantly reduced in fresh melanoma samples, while MGMT showed a 12-fold upregulation at the messenger ribonucleic acid level (P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that epigenetic silencing of the studied tumor suppressor genes is a common and probably important mechanism for melanoma formation.

In MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, expression of the tumor suppressor gene p14(ARF) fails to trigger apoptosis but induces an arrest in the G1 and, to a lesser extent, in the G2 phase in the cell division cycle. Here, inhibition of cell cycle arrest resulted in apoptosis induction in caspase-3 proficient MCF-7 cells upon expression of p14(ARF) . This occurred in the absence of S-phase progression or mitotic entry. In contrast, syngeneic, caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells remained entirely resistant to p14(ARF) -induced apoptosis. Thus, cell cycle checkpoint abrogation overcomes resistance to p14(ARF) -induced cell death and promotes cell death via a caspase-3-dependent pathway. Cell death coincided with dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and was inhibitable by pan-caspase inhibitors and the caspase-3/7 inhibitor zDEVD-fmk. Of note, mitochondrial events of apoptosis execution depended entirely on caspase-3 proficiency indicating that caspase-3 either acts \"up-stream\" of the mitochondria in a \"non-canonical\" pathway or mediates a mitochondrial feedback loop to amplify the apoptotic caspase signal in p14(ARF) -induced stress signaling.

Contrasting studies focusing on single gene mutations, we hypothesize chemoresistance to be due to inactivation of key pathways affecting cellular mechanisms such as apoptosis, senescence, or DNA repair. In support of this hypothesis, we have previously shown inactivation of either TP53 or its key activators CHK2 and ATM to predict resistance to DNA damaging drugs in breast cancer better than TP53 mutations alone. Further, we hypothesized that redundant pathway(s) may compensate for loss of p53-pathway signaling and that these are inactivated as well in resistant tumour cells. Here, we assessed genetic alterations of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) and its key regulators: Cyclin D and E as well as their inhibitors p16 and p27. In an exploratory cohort of 69 patients selected from two prospective studies treated with either doxorubicin monotherapy or 5-FU and mitomycin for locally advanced breast cancers, we found defects in the pRB-pathway to be associated with therapy resistance (p-values ranging from 0.001 to 0.094, depending on the cut-off value applied to p27 expression levels). Although statistically weaker, we observed confirmatory associations in a validation cohort from another prospective study (n = 107 patients treated with neoadjuvant epirubicin monotherapy; p-values ranging from 7.0 × 10(-4) to 0.001 in the combined data sets). Importantly, inactivation of the p53-and the pRB-pathways in concert predicted resistance to therapy more strongly than each of the two pathways assessed individually (exploratory cohort: p-values ranging from 3.9 × 10(-6) to 7.5 × 10(-3) depending on cut-off values applied to ATM and p27 mRNA expression levels). Again, similar findings were confirmed in the validation cohort, with p-values ranging from 6.0 × 10(-7) to 6.5 × 10(-5) in the combined data sets.

Data from the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies food frequency questionnaire were used to calculate the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS), a validated summary estimate of diet quality based on adherence to the Australian dietary guidelines.;The mean (SD) ARFS of the BCS group was 33.2 (9.4) out of a maximum of 74. Mean (SD) total ARFS and component scores of BCS did not differ from the HC group [32.9 (8.7)] and no differences were found in ARFS between urban and rural BCS.;This is the first study dedicated exclusively to describing the diet quality of Australian BCS. Although no difference was found when comparisons were made with a HC group, there is considerable room for improvement in the diet quality of Australian BCS. Given research suggesting higher risk of chronic conditions such as obesity amongst BCS, and the recognition of optimising diet quality as a key factor in health promotion for all population groups, data from the present study suggest the need for research targeting the feasibility and impact of improving diet quality of Australian BCS.",

Using an unbiased global screen for CpG island methylation events, we have identified a non-random pattern of DNA hypermethylation acquired in p16-repressed cells. Interestingly, this pattern included loci located upstream of a number of homeobox genes. Upon removal of p16(INK4A) activity in primary human mammary epithelial cells, polycomb repressors, EZH2 and SUZ12, are up-regulated and recruited to HOXA9, a locus expressed during normal breast development and epigenetically silenced in breast cancer. We demonstrate that at this targeted locus, the up-regulation of polycomb repressors is accompanied by the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases and the hypermethylation of DNA, an endpoint, which we show to be dependent on SUZ12 expression. These results demonstrate a causal role of p16(INK4A) disruption in modulating DNA hypermethylation, and identify a dynamic and active process whereby epigenetic modulation of gene expression is activated as an early event in breast tumor progression.",

Further markers on chromosomes 3 and 9 were analyzed individually.;Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was identified in 63% of tumors, most frequently on chromosome 3 (52%), in association with epithelioid cells (P = 0.0002) and microvascular loops (P = 0.0008). In the majority of cases, LOH on chromosome 3 was detected at all informative markers. The second most common alteration was LOH at an RB1 intragenic marker (21% tumors), with retention of a more centromeric 13q marker (near BRCA2). The pattern of LOH on chromosome 9p was consistent with the involvement of a region telomeric to CDKN2A. LOH at TP53 was infrequent.;In the majority of cases, chromosome 3 LOH involves an entire chromosome homologue, which hampers identification of the relevant suppressor loci. This LOH correlates with the presence of microvascular loops and epithelioid cells, two of the recognized histologic indicators of poor prognosis. Data for chromosomes 13 and 9 support a role for RB1 in the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma but also raise the possibility of the involvement of additional loci close to RB1 and CDKN2A.",

To determine the origin of these variant HMECs in culture, we used Luria-Delbrück fluctuation analysis and found that variant HMECs exist within the population before the proliferation barrier, thereby raising the possibility that variant HMECs exist in vivo before cultivation.

Previous findings have suggested that POGLUT1 promotes the proliferation of U937 human tissue lymphoma cells. Furthermore, POGLUT1 has been identified in other tissues, including the mammary glands, lymph nodes, intestine, liver and spleen. In the present study, in order to investigate the function and target of POGLUT1 in BT474 breast cancer cells, the effect of POGLUT1 on cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and key proteins in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway was investigated in BT474 cells. The overexpression of POGLUT1 in the presence of TGF-β1 was found to significantly enhance cell viability. Flow cytometric and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that POGLUT1 had an effect on the cell cycle and inhibited the TGF-β1-induced transcriptional upregulation of p16, a major cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI). Furthermore, phosphorylated (p)-Smad3, which has a key role in mediating the TGF-β antiproliferative response, was greatly inhibited by exogenous POGLUT1, suggesting a role for POGLUT1 in the TGF-β1-mediated signaling pathway in the BT474 cell cycle. However, no significant changes were observed in the expression of other CDKIs or in cell apoptosis. The findings of the present study show that the increase in BT474 cell viabilty induced by POGLUT1 is associated with POGLUT1-induced inhibition of the transcriptional upregulation of p16 by TGF-β1, which may be a result of the inhibition of p-Smad3.",

The cell subpopulation that emerges spontaneously from selection undergoes a further limited period of proliferation before senescence. By immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of four independent cultures, we have shown loss of p16INK4 expression in postselection HMECs. In contrast, p16INK4 was present in both early and late passage fibroblasts from the same individuals. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed extensive methylation of the p16INK4 CpG island in post- but not preselection cells. Thus, the extended period of growth observed in postselection HMECs is associated with hypermethylation of the p16INK4 CpG island and loss of p16INK4 expression.

However, it is not fully understood how this compound promotes mammary carcinogenesis. In our study, we examined the effect of BPA on cellular proliferation and senescence in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Exposure to BPA for 1 week at the early stage at passage 8 increased the proliferation and sphere size of HMEC at the later stage up to passage 16, suggesting that BPA has the capability to modulate cell growth in breast epithelial cells. Interestingly, the number of human heterochromatin protein-1γ positive cells, which is a marker of senescence, was also increased among BPA-treated cells. Consistent with these findings, the protein levels of both p16 and cyclin E, which are known to induce cellular senescence and promote proliferation, respectively, were increased in BPA-exposed HMEC. Furthermore, DNA methylation levels of genes related to development of most or all tumor types, such as BRCA1, CCNA1, CDKN2A (p16), THBS1, TNFRSF10C and TNFRSF10D, were increased in BPA-exposed HMEC.

Human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), normal fibroblasts (Hs68 and WI38), HeLa cervical carcinoma and HTB-30 breast carcinoma cells arrest in G(1)/S in response to severe hypoxia. Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells did not exhibit orderly G(1)/S arrest in response to severe hypoxia. We found a general decrease in p16(INK4a) (p16) mRNA levels, with an associated decrease in p16 protein levels in both normal cells and in cancer cells, regardless of their cell cycle response to hypoxia. p27 protein levels did not correlate with the cell line's ability to enter a hypoxic G(1)/S arrest. Furthermore, cell lines that underwent G(1)/S arrest showed decreased expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha) and at least one member of INK4 or Sdi cell cycle kinase inhibitors families after 12-24 h of hypoxia. Conversely, Hep3B, which did not exhibit orderly hypoxia-associated G(1)/S arrest, also did not show decreased HIF-1alpha, INK4 or Sdi protein levels in hypoxia. Furthermore, Hep3B showed constitutive activating phosphorylation of Akt and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3beta, which was the opposite pattern to that exhibited by the cell lines showing the G(1)/S arrest phenotype. Inhibition of GSK3beta by lithium chloride treatment of HeLa cells converted the HIF-1alpha, p16 and p27 loss to levels unchanged by hypoxic exposure. Our results suggest that regulation of the cell cycle during hypoxia in either normal or cancer cells is not simply due to up-regulation of cell cycle kinase inhibitors.

The average age in the present cohort of 100 sporadic cases of invasive ductal carcinomas was 45 years, with a median of 46 years (range between 19-81 years). In an effort to understand the molecular signature of BC in the Saudi population, we undertook this study to profile the methylation events in a series of key genes including Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family member 1 isoform a (RASSF1A), hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB2), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), paired-like homeodomain 2 (PITX2), secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD1), and slit homolog 2 (SLIT2), using MethyLight analysis in archival tumour samples. Interestingly, the overall methylation levels were low in this cohort, with only 84% of the cases displaying methylation in one or more of the analysed genes. The frequency of RASSF1A methylation was the highest (65%), while there was almost complete absence of methylation of the ESR1 and the CDH1 genes (1% and 3%, respectively). Several statistically significant correlations were identified between specific methylation events and clinical parameters which gained more significance when analysis was limited to the estrogen receptor positive samples. Although there was no significant correlations between any methylation event and disease-specific survival, methylation of MYOD1 or RASSF1A was associated with lower disease-free survival and increased chance of disease recurrence. Furthermore, multivariate (Cox) regression analysis identified RASSF1A as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in terms of disease-free survival in this cohort. Our findings provide further evidence on the usefulness of RASSF1A methylation status as an informative prognostic biomarker in BC in a Saudi population.",

Homozygous mutations, in mice, are embryonic lethal while heterozygous mutations result in perturbed mammary gland development. In humans, mutations that result in the haploinsufficiency of TBX3 causes Ulnar Mammary Syndrome (UMS) characterized by mammary gland hypoplasia as well as other congenital defects. In addition to its role in mammary gland development, various studies have also supported a role for Tbx3 in breast cancer development. TBX3 is over-expressed in various breast cancer cell lines as well as cancer tissue and has been found to contribute to breast cancer cell migration. Previous studies have suggested that TBX3 contributes to cancer development by its ability to bypass senescence by repressing the expression of p14(ARF)-tumor suppressor. Although many studies have shown that a dysregulation of TBX3 expression may contribute to cancer progression, no direct evidence shows TBX3 causes breast cancer.;In this study, we created doxycycline inducible double transgenic mice (MMTV-rtTA;tet-myc-TBX3-IRES-Luciferase) to test whether TBX3 over-expression can induce tumor formation within the mammary gland. Although over-expression of TBX3, alone, did not induce tumor formation it did promote accelerated mammary gland development by increasing mammary epithelial cell proliferation. We also show that TBX3 directly binds to and represses NFκBIB, an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway known to play a role in regulating cell proliferation. Lastly, we also show that the over-expression of TBX3 is associated with an increase in mammary stem-like cells.;Overall, our data suggests that over-expression of TBX3 may contribute to breast cancer development by promoting accelerated mammary gland development through the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and stimulation of both mammary epithelial cell and stem-like cell proliferation.",

Reliable measurement of cell viability, proliferation, growth inhibition and death is important in screening for drug treatment efficacy in vitro. This report describes and compares commonly used proliferation assays for induced estrogen-responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cell cycle arrest including: determination of cell number by direct counting of viable cells; or fluorescence SYBR®Green (SYBR) DNA labeling; determination of mitochondrial metabolic activity by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay; assessment of newly synthesized DNA using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) nucleoside analog binding and Alexa Fluor® azide visualization by fluorescence microscopy; cell-cycle phase measurement by flow cytometry. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with ICI 182780 (Faslodex), FTY720, serum deprivation or induction of the tumor suppressor p14ARF showed inhibition of cell proliferation determined by the Trypan Blue exclusion assay and SYBR DNA labeling assay. In contrast, the effects of treatment with ICI 182780 or p14ARF-induction were not confirmed using the MTS assay. Cell cycle inhibition by ICI 182780 and p14ARF-induction was further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis and EdU-DNA incorporation. To explore this discrepancy further, we showed that ICI 182780 and p14ARF-induction increased MCF-7 cell mitochondrial activity by MTS assay in individual cells compared to control cells thereby providing a misleading proliferation readout. Interrogation of p14ARF-induction on MCF-7 metabolic activity using TMRE assays and high content image analysis showed that increased mitochondrial activity was concomitant with increased mitochondrial biomass with no loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, or cell death. We conclude that, whilst p14ARF and ICI 182780 stop cell cycle progression, the cells are still viable and potential treatments utilizing these pathways may contribute to drug resistant cells. These experiments demonstrate how the combined measurement of metabolic activity and DNA labeling provides a more reliable interpretation of cancer cell response to treatment regimens.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There have been several studies on gallbladder carcinogenesis, and mutations of the KRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A genes have been reported in gallbladder carcinoma. The DBC1 gene (deleted in breast cancer 1) was initially cloned from region 8p21, which was homozygously deleted in breast cancer. DBC1 has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and death. The functional role of DBC1 in normal cells and the role of DBC1 loss in cancer are not entirely clear. And DBC1 expression and its clinical implications in gallbladder carcinoma have yet to be thoroughly elucidated. Therefore, we evaluated DBC1 expression in 104 gallbladder carcinoma tissues in relation to survival and other prognostic factors via immunohistochemical analysis. DBC1 expression was divided into two categories: high DBC1 expression was observed in 32/104 cases (30.8%) and low expression in 72/104 cases (69.2%). High DBC1 expression correlated significantly with favorable clinicopathologic variables. Furthermore, in survival analysis, the high-DBC1 expression group showed a better survival rate compared to the low-DBC1 expression group. In conclusion, high DBC1 expression is associated with several favorable clinicopathologic factors in gallbladder carcinoma. These findings suggest that loss of DBC1 expression plays a role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression in gallbladder carcinoma. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"p16-mediated inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and tumor suppression have been studied before,; the common consensus is that p16's cell-cycle arrest function plays a primary role in these actions, with some additional apoptotic induction by p16. However, other effects of p16 that may potentially contribute to p16-mediated anti-tumor ability have not been well studied. The emerging data including ours indicated that p16 contributes its anti-cancer ability by inducing tumor cells to senescence. Moreover, we showed that p16 inhibits breast cancer cell growth by inhibiting the VEGF signaling pathway and angiogenesis. In this study, we used adenoviral-mediated p16 expression (AdRSVp16) and breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as the model to simultaneously analyze all these p16's anti-tumor functions. We demonstrated that adenoviral-mediated p16 expression exhibited multiple anti-tumor functions by simultaneously suppressing in vitro growth and in vivo angiogenesis of breast cancer cells, blocking cell division, as well as inducing senescence and apoptosis. The in vivo study implies that p16's effect on anti-angiogenesis may play a more significant role than its anti-cell proliferation in the overall suppression of tumor growth. These results suggest, for the first time, that AdRSVp16-mediated tumor suppression results from a combination of p16's multiple anti-tumor functions including p16's well-known anti-proliferation/cell division function, apoptotic and senescence induction function, and its lesser-known/under-investigated anti-angiogenesis function. These combined results strongly indicate that p16 gene therapy has a multi-module platform with different anti-tumor functions; therefore, this study justifies and promotes the viral-mediated p16 gene therapy as a promising and powerful treatment approach for cancer patients due to p16's multiple anti-tumor functions.",

Therefore, it became clear that efficient therapeutic regimens should also take into account the presence of these supportive cells and inhibit their paracrine effects. To this end, we tested the effect of low concentrations of curcumin, a pharmacologically safe natural product, on patient-derived primary breast CAF cells. We have shown that curcumin treatment upregulates p16(INK4A) and other tumor suppressor proteins while inactivates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. This reduced the level of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and the migration/invasion abilities of these cells. Furthermore, curcumin suppressed the expression/secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and transforming growth factor-β, which impeded their paracrine procarcinogenic potential. Intriguingly, these effects were sustained even after curcumin withdrawal and cell splitting. Therefore, using different markers of senescence [senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, Ki-67 and Lamin B1 levels, and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation], we have shown that curcumin markedly suppresses Lamin B1 and triggers DNA damage-independent senescence in proliferating but not quiescent breast stromal fibroblasts. Importantly, this curcumin-related senescence was p16(INK4A)-dependent and occurred with no associated inflammatory secretory phenotype. These results indicate the possible inactivation of cancer-associated myofibroblasts and present the first indication that curcumin can trigger DNA damage-independent and safe senescence in stromal fibroblasts.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent molecular data pointed towards the possibility of a stepwise dedifferentiation in a subgroup of invasive breast cancer (BC) cases. It was hypothesized that oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) grade 3 (G3) ductal invasive BCs are the end stage of a dedifferentiation process of luminal BC. A progression of luminal A towards luminal B BCs associated with a 'progression through grade' and an increased cell proliferation seemed the obvious explanation. In order to verify this hypothesis on a morphological and immunohistochemical level, we investigated 865 invasive BC cases. All cases were reviewed for the presence of intratumoural heterogeneity in grade of the invasive cancer and the presence of associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). With the use of tissue microarrays, the molecular subtype was determined and correlated with clinico-pathological features. In addition, all cases were stained for p21, p27, Ki-67, Cyclin D1, bcl-2, p53, and p16 and the results subjected to a biomathematical dependency analysis. The frequency of ER-positivity decreased with tumour size. The frequency of luminal A BC decreased as well, whereas the number of luminal B BCs remained constant. A gradual increase of the frequency of basal-like, HER2-driven and non-expressor BCs with tumour size was seen. In only 1 out of 865 BC cases, both a G1 and a G3 invasive cancer component was seen within the same BC. In two cases, a ductal invasive G1 carcinoma was associated with a poorly-differentiated DCIS. The frequency of columnar cell lesions was evenly distributed over ER+ and ER- ductal invasive G3 carcinomas. The biomathematical analysis gave striking hints against an obligate progression of BC trough grade. In conclusion, our results show that a morphological recognizable striking 'progression through grade' at least in its extreme form from G1 towards G3 is a very rare event in the natural course of invasive BC, including luminal BC.",

These tumors are excellent models of human breast cancer but until recently there was only anecdotal evidence regarding underlying genetic defects. We recently reported expression defects in the cyclin-dependent kinase p21/Cip1 and p53 among three independent canine mammary tumor (CMT) cell lines derived from spontaneous canine mammary cancers. We investigated further defects in the same three cell lines focusing on additional tumor suppressor gene defects in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. p27/KIP1 appeared normally expressed and did not appear to encode inactivating mutations. In contrast, expression of p16/INK4A was defective/absent in two cell lines and normal/slightly induced in the third cell line. To determine if defects were causative in maintaining the transformed phenotype, a p16/INK4A transgene was permanently transfected followed by selection and single cell cloning. CMT/p16 clones were characterized for transgene expression, p16 protein content and phenotype including proliferation rate, cell cycle phase distribution, contact inhibition, substrate dependent cell growth and cell morphology. All cell lines appeared unique yet clear indications of phenotype rescue due to p16/INK4A transgene complementation were observed suggesting that defects in p16 expression were present in all three. In some cases cellular senescence also appeared to be induced. These data provide evidence supporting p16/INK4A mutations as causative defects promoting transformation in canine mammary cancer and further characterizes tumor suppressor gene defects with functional consequences in these cells supporting their application as spontaneous animal models of human disease.",

We evaluated case-control association of MTHFR C677T, A1298C, and MTR A2756G polymorphisms for cases strata-defined by promoter methylation status for each of three genes, E-cadherin, p16, and RAR-beta2 in breast cancer; in addition, we evaluated case-case comparisons of the likelihood of promoter methylation in relation to genotypes using a population-based case-control study conducted in Western New York State.

We applied unordered polytomous regression and unconditional logistic regression to derive adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

There was no evidence of difference within strata defined by menopausal status, estrogen receptor status, folate intake, and lifetime alcohol consumption.

Expression analysis of ANRIL, EZH2, SUZ12, EED, JARID2, CBX7, BMI1, p16, p15, and p14/ARF genes was evaluated in a large cohort of invasive breast carcinomas (IBC, n = 456) by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on CBX7, EZH2, p14, p15, p16, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac. We observed significant overexpression in IBCs of ANRIL (19.7%) and EZH2 (77.0%) and an underexpression of CBX7 (39.7%). Correlations were identified between these genes, their expression patterns, and several classical clinical and pathologic parameters, molecular subtypes, and patient outcomes, as well as with proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and breast cancer stem cell markers. Multivariate analysis revealed that combined EZH2/CBX7 status is an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.001). In addition, several miRNAs negatively associated with CBX7 underexpression and EZH2 overexpression. These data demonstrate a complex pattern of interactions between lncRNA ANRIL, several miRNAs, PRC2/PRC1 subunits, and p15/CDKN2B-p16/CDKN2A-p14/ARF locus and suggest that their expression should be considered together to evaluate antitumoral drugs, in particular the BET bromodomain inhibitors.;This study suggests that the global pattern of expression rather than expression of individual family members should be taken into account when defining functionality of repressive Polycomb complexes and therapeutic targeting potential.

We demonstrate that an Mre11-mediated DDR restrains mammary hyperplasia by effecting an oncogene-induced G2 arrest. Impairment of Mre11 complex functions promotes the progression of mammary hyperplasias into invasive and metastatic breast cancers, which are often associated with secondary inactivation of the Ink4a-Arf (CDKN2a) locus.

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and consists of a heterogeneous collection of diseases with distinct histopathological, genetic and epigenetic characteristics. In this study, we aimed to identify DNA methylation based biomarkers to distinguish patients with locally advanced breast cancer who may benefit from neoadjuvant doxorubicin treatment.;We investigated quantitatively the methylation patterns in the promoter regions of 14 genes (ABCB1, ATM, BRCA1, CDH3, CDKN2A, CXCR4, ESR1, FBXW7, FOXC1, GSTP1, IGF2, HMLH1, PPP2R2B, and PTEN) in 75 well-described pre-treatment samples from locally advanced breast cancer and correlated the results to the available clinical and molecular parameters. Six normal breast tissues were used as controls and 163 unselected breast cancer cases were used to validate associations with histopathological and clinical parameters.Aberrant methylation was detected in 9 out of the 14 genes including the discovery of methylation at the FOXC1 promoter. Absence of methylation at the ABCB1 promoter correlated with progressive disease during doxorubicin treatment. Most importantly, the DNA methylation status at the promoters of GSTP1, FOXC1 and ABCB1 correlated with survival, whereby the combination of methylated genes improved the subdivision with respect to the survival of the patients. In multivariate analysis GSTP1 and FOXC1 methylation status proved to be independent prognostic markers associated with survival.;Quantitative DNA methylation profiling is a powerful tool to identify molecular changes associated with specific phenotypes. Methylation at the ABCB1 or GSTP1 promoter improved overall survival probably due to prolonged availability and activity of the drug in the cell while FOXC1 methylation might be a protective factor against tumour invasiveness. FOXC1 proved to be general prognostic factor, while ABCB1 and GSTP1 might be predictive factors for the response to and efficacy of doxorubicin treatment. Pharmacoepigenetic effects such as the reported associations in this study provide molecular explanations for differential responses to chemotherapy and it might prove valuable to take the methylation status of selected genes into account for patient management and treatment decisions.",

The long-term effect of progestins on T-47D breast cancer cells is inhibition of cellular proliferation. This is accompanied by decreased G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activities, redistribution of the CDK inhibitor p27(Kip1) among these CDK complexes, and alterations in the elution profile of cyclin E-Cdk2 upon gel filtration chromatography, such that high-molecular-weight complexes predominate. This study aimed to determine the relative contribution of CDK inhibitors to these events. Following progestin treatment, the majority of cyclin E- and D-CDK complexes were bound to p27(Kip1) and few were bound to p21(Cip1). In vitro, recombinant His(6)-p27 could quantitatively reproduce the effects on cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity and the shift in molecular weight observed following progestin treatment. In contrast, cyclin D-Cdk4 was not inhibited by His(6)-p27 in vitro or p27(Kip1) in vivo. However, an increase in the expression of the Cdk4/6 inhibitor p18(INK4c) and its extensive association with Cdk4 and Cdk6 were apparent following progestin treatment. Recombinant p18(INK4c) led to the reassortment of cyclin-CDK-CDK inhibitor complexes in vitro, with consequent decrease in cyclin E-Cdk2 activity. These results suggest a concerted model of progestin action whereby p27(Kip1) and p18(INK4c) cooperate to inhibit cyclin E-Cdk2 and Cdk4. Since similar models have been developed for growth inhibition by transforming growth factor beta and during adipogenesis, interaction between the Cip/Kip and INK4 families of inhibitors may be a common theme in physiological growth arrest and differentiation.",

In addition to explaining a proportion of familial pancreatic cancer, individuals with these conditions are at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. Relatives from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds without one of these identifiable syndromes may have as high as a 32-fold risk of pancreatic cancer, depending on the number of affected first-degree relatives.

Dysregulated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity has oncogenic potential in breast cancer due to its ability to inactivate key tumor suppressor networks and drive aberrant proliferation. Accumulation or over-expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1) occurs in a majority of breast cancers and over-expression of CCND1 leads to accumulation of activated CCND1/CDK2 complexes in breast cancer cells. We describe here the role of constitutively active CCND1/CDK2 complexes in human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) transformation. A genetically-defined, stepwise HMEC transformation model was generated by inhibiting p16 and p53 with shRNA, and expressing exogenous MYC and mutant RAS. By replacing components of this model, we demonstrate that constitutive CCND1/CDK2 activity effectively confers anchorage independent growth by inhibiting p53 or replacing MYC or oncogenic RAS expression. These findings are consistent with several clinical observations of luminal breast cancer sub-types that show elevated CCND1 typically occurs in specimens that retain wild-type p53, do not amplify MYC, and contain no RAS mutations. Taken together, these data suggest that targeted inhibition of constitutive CCND1/CDK2 activity may enhance the effectiveness of current treatments for luminal breast cancer.",

Expression levels of both C/EBPalpha isoforms, C/EBPbeta isoforms LAP1, LAP2 (liver-enriched transcriptional activating proteins), and LIP (liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein), and C/EBPdelta in the tumors were correlated with clinicopathological tumor parameters, expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PR), Ki67 immunostaining, and expression of seven cell-cycle regulatory proteins which had been analyzed before. High C/EBPalpha and -delta protein levels correlated significantly with expression of cell-cycle promoters (cyclin D1 and E) and cell-cycle inhibitory proteins (Rb, p27, p16), but with none of the established prognostic parameters. In contrast, statistically significant relationships of the full-length C/EBPbeta isoform LAP1 and a negative estrogen receptor status, high grading, nodal involvement, and high cyclin E and p16 expression were found. For the shorter isoform LIP, correlations with an ER-negative phenotype and high Ki67 immunostaining were detected, and high histological grading (G3) correlated with lower LAP/LIP ratio.

S100A4 interacts with various target genes that affect tumor cell metastasis; however, little is known about cellular signaling pathways elicited by S100A4. In the current study, we demonstrate an inhibitory effect of S100A4 on β-catenin signaling in breast cancer cells. By overexpressing S100A4 in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, we observed the down-regulation of β-catenin expression and β-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF transcriptional activities. The activity of GSK3β, which phosphorylates β-catenin and induces proteasomal degradation of β-catenin, was increased in S100A4-overexpressing cell lines. Blocking Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK3β) activity by lithium chloride or Dvl gene overexpression restored β-catenin expression. We also found that increased GSK3β activity was due to decrease in Akt activity resulting from Egr-1-induced phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression. S100A4 induced Egr-1 nuclear localization by increasing the association between Egr-1 and importin-7 and this effect was reduced in S100A4 mutants that harbored a defect in nuclear localization signals. Collectively, we verify herein that S100A4 may act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancers by down-regulating the central signaling axis for tumor cell survival.",

We investigated the respective roles of Skp2 and subcellular localization of p27Kip1 in down-regulation of p27Kip1 induced in MCF-7 cells by estrogens. 17beta-Estradiol treatment increased Skp2 expression in MCF-7 cells; however, this increase was prevented by G1 blockade mediated by p16Ink4a or the CDK inhibitor roscovitine, whereas down-regulation of p27Kip1 was maintained. Exogenous Skp2 prevented growth arrest of MCF-7 cells by antiestrogen, coinciding with decreased p27Kip1 expression. Under conditions of G1 blockade, p27Kip1 was stabilized by inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export with leptomycin B or by mutation of p27Kip1 (Ser10 --> Ala; S10A) interfering with CRM1/p27Kip1 interaction. Antisense Skp2 oligonucleotides and a dominant-interfering Cul-1(1-452) mutant prevented down-regulation of p27Kip1S10A, whereas Skp2 overexpression elicited its destruction in mitogen-deprived cells. Active mediators of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway including Raf-1caax induced cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1 in antiestrogen-treated cells and prevented accumulation of p27Kip1 in these cells independent of Skp2 expression and coinciding with ERK activation. Genetic or chemical blockade of the ERK pathway prevented down-regulation and cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1 in response to estrogen. Our studies indicate that estrogens elicit down-regulation of p27Kip1 in MCF-7 cells through Skp2-dependent and -independent mechanisms that depend upon subcellular localization of p27Kip1 and require the participation of mediators of the Ras/Raf-1/ERK signaling pathway.",

BRCA1 pathogenic mutations were found in 20 cases, including two cases with CNVs, whereas BRCA2 mutations were found in 7 cases. We also found three patients with the TP53 R337H mutation and one patient with the CHEK2 1100delC mutation. Seven (25%) pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2 were firstly described, including a splice-site BRCA1 mutation for which pathogenicity was confirmed by the presence of an aberrant transcript showing the loss of the last 62 bp of exon 7. Microdeletions of exon 4 in ATM and exon 2 in PTEN were identified in BRCA2-mutated and BRCA1/2-negative patients, respectively.;In summary, our results showed a high frequency of BRCA1/2 mutations and a higher prevalence of BRCA1 (64.5%) gene. Moreover, the detection of the TP53 R337H variant in our series and the fact that this variant has a founder effect in our population prompted us to suggest that all female breast cancer patients with clinical criteria for HBOC and negative for BRCA1/2 genes should be tested for the TP53 R337H variant. Furthermore, the presence of genomic structural rearrangement resulting in CNVs in other genes that predispose breast cancer in conjunction with BRCA2 point mutations demonstrated a highly complex genetic etiology in Brazilian breast cancer families.",

We crossed Fet-null mice in the C57BL/6 background with PyMT mice in the same background and after a controlled breeding protocol obtained PyMT/Fet+/+, PyMT/Fet+/-, and PyMT/Fet-/- mice that were placed in control and experimental groups. Whereas the control group (PyMT/Fet+/+) formed mammary tumors 90 days after birth, tumor latency was prolonged in the PyMT/Fet-/- and PyMT/Fet+/- mice. The majority of the PyMT/Fet-/- mice were tumor-free at the end of the study, at approximately 40 weeks. The pathology of the mammary tumors in the Fet-null mice showed extensive fibrosis, necrosis, and squamous metaplasia. The preneoplastic mammary tissues of the PyMT/Fet-/- mice showed intense phopho-Smad2/3 staining relative to control tissues, indicating that transforming growth factor-β signaling is enhanced in these tissues in the absence of Fet. Likewise, p19ARF and p53 were highly expressed in tumor tissues of PyMT/Fet-/- mice relative to the controls in the absence of Fet. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway that we previously showed to be activated by Fet, on the other hand, was unaffected by the absence of Fet. The data indicate that Fet is a powerful modulator of breast tumorigenesis in this model system and has the potential to modulate breast cancer progression in humans.",

Here, we identified hSNF5 and p53 as the binding partners of RB1CC1 by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Interaction between these molecules and the RB1 pathway was analyzed by the assays of chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase-reporter, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot.

The nuclear RB1CC1 complex involving hSNF5 and/or p53 activated transcription of RB1, p16 and p21, and suppressed tumor cell growth. Furthermore, nuclear RB1CC1 expression significantly correlated with those of RB1 and p16 in breast cancer tissue in vivo, and the Ki-67 proliferation index was dependent on p53 as well as RB1CC1. The present study indicates that RB1CC1 together with hSNF5 and/or p53 enhances the RB1 pathway through transcriptional activation of RB1, p16 and p21.

In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying bladder cancer, differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) and their target genes in bladder cancer were analyzed. In the present study, miRNA and mRNA expression profiles (GSE40355) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. These consisted of healthy bladder samples (n=8) and urothelial carcinoma samples (low-grade, n=8 and high-grade, n=8). DE-miRNAs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package and the Benjamin and Hochberg method from the multtest package in R. Target genes of DE-miRNAs were screened. Associations between DEGs were investigated using STRING, and an interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for DEGs from the interaction network. 87 DE-miRNAs and 2058 DEGs were screened from low-grade bladder cancer samples, and 40 DE-miRNAs and 2477 DEGs were screened from high-grade bladder cancer samples. DE-target genes were significantly associated with the regulation of cell apoptosis. Bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer biological pathways were found to be enriched. The results of the present study demonstrated that E2F transcription factor 1, which is targeted by miR-106b, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog-2, which are targeted by miR-125b, participate in the bladder cancer pathway. In conclusion, DE-miRNAs in bladder cancer tissue samples and DE-targeted genes, such as miR-106b and CDKN2A, which were identified in the present study, may provide the basis for targeted therapy for breast cancer and enhance understanding of its pathogenesis.",

Histone deacetylase inhibitors arrest cancer cell growth and cause apoptosis with low toxicity thereby constituting a promising treatment for cancer. In this study, we examined the antiproliferative effects of valproate with a combination of nicotinamide in the MCF-7 cell line. MCF-7 was treated with various concentrations of valproate. The MTT assay showed that the viability of MCF-7 cells was inhibited and the cell activity was decreased. Viability percent of valproate and nicotinamide combined treatment cells (28 ± 2) was 1.78 times increased compared with the valproate-alone (0.5 mM) treated cells (50 ± 2). Colony formation in soft agar indicated that valproate at 0.3 mM, when used alone, weakly suppressed proliferation of cells (82 ± 3) and the combination treatment of valproate + nicotinamide strongly suppressed cell proliferation (51 ± 3). The flow cytometric and microscopic analyses of HDACI combined with treated cells indicated strong apoptosis induction and nuclear morphological alterations greater than those of valproate alone. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis confirmed the efficiency of the HDAC inhibitor combination, revealing the effectively upregulated p16 and p21. Furthermore, to investigate the role of acetyl-histone H3 levels, western blot analyses have been performed and high levels of acetylated histone H3 were detected in valproate- and nicotinamide-treated cells. These results suggest that the combination treatment of valproate with nicotinamide exerts significant antitumor activity and could be a promising therapeutic candidate to treat human breast cancer.

With increasing age, breast cancer incidence increases, with hormone receptor-positive and other luminal-like subtype tumors comprising a majority of cases. It is not known at what stage of tumor progression subtype specification occurs, nor how the process of aging affects the intrinsic subtype. We examined subtype markers in immortalized human mammary epithelial cell lines established following exposure of primary cultured cell strains to a two-step immortalization protocol that targets the two main barriers to immortality: stasis (stress-associated senescence) and replicative senescence. Cell lines derived from epithelial cells obtained from non-tumorous pre- and post-menopausal breast surgery tissues were compared. Additionally, comparisons were made between lines generated using two different genetic interventions to bypass stasis: transduction of either an shRNA that down-regulated p16(INK4A), or overexpressed constitutive active cyclin D1/CDK2. In all cases, the replicative senescence barrier was bypassed by transduction of c-Myc. Cells from all resulting immortal lines exhibited normal karyotypes. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and gene expression analyses of lineage-specific markers were used to categorize the intrinsic subtypes of the immortalized lines. Bypassing stasis with p16 shRNA in young strains generated cell lines that were invariably basal-like, but the lines examined from older strains exhibited some luminal features such as keratin 19 and estrogen receptor expression. Overexpression of cyclin D1/CDK2 resulted in keratin 19 positive, luminal-like cell lines from both young and old strains, and the lines examined from older strains exhibited estrogen receptor expression. Thus age and the method of bypassing stasis independently influence the subtype of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells. ",

The aim of this study was to characterise the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of p16 in patients with BLBC compared with non-BLBC.;Eighty-five cases of grade-3 invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS) were analyzed. Immunohistochemical stains for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p16 were performed. BLBC was defined as ER-, PR-, Her2- and CK5/6+, and/or EGFR+.;Twenty cases were categorised as BLBC versus 65 as non-basal. High mitotic count and presence of necrosis were associated with basal-like phenotype. Distant metastasis developed in 40% of cases of BLBC with frequent spread to brain and lung. p16 had significantly higher expression in the basal subgroup (80% versus 50.8%, P = 0.04). Patients with BLBCs were found to have a lower disease-free survival (DFS) rate (60% versus 70.8%, P = 0.03).;BLBC typically demonstrates a unique profile. p16 is frequently expressed in breast cancers with basal-like phenotype; this suggests that p16 may play a role in the poor prognosis of this tumour, and it may be used in the development of a targeted therapy that will result in improved patient prognostication and outcome.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although two major breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have been identified accounting for 20% of breast cancer genetic risk, identification of other susceptibility genes accounting for 80% risk remains a challenge due to the complex, multi-factorial nature of breast cancer. Complexity derives from multiple genetic determinants, permutations of gene-environment interactions, along with presumptive low-penetrance of breast cancer predisposing genes, and genetic heterogeneity of human populations. As with other complex diseases, dissection of genetic determinants in animal models provides key insight since genetic heterogeneity and environmental factors can be experimentally controlled, thus facilitating the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL). We therefore, performed the first genome-wide scan for loci contributing to radiation-induced mammary tumorigenesis in female F2-(Dahl S x R)-intercross rats. Tumorigenesis was measured as tumor burden index (TBI) after induction of rat mammary tumors at forty days of age via ¹²⁷Cs-radiation. We observed a spectrum of tumor latency, size-progression, and pathology from poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma to fibroadenoma, indicating major effects of gene-environment interactions. We identified two mammary tumorigenesis susceptibility quantitative trait loci (Mts-QTLs) with significant linkage: Mts-1 on chromosome-9 (LOD-2.98) and Mts-2 on chromosome-1 (LOD-2.61), as well as two Mts-QTLs with suggestive linkage: Mts-3 on chromosome-5 (LOD-1.93) and Mts-4 on chromosome-18 (LOD-1.54). Interestingly, Chr9-Mts-1, Chr5-Mts-3 and Chr18-Mts-4 QTLs are unique to irradiation-induced mammary tumorigenesis, while Chr1-Mts-2 QTL overlaps with a mammary cancer susceptibility QTL (Mcs 3) reported for 7,12-dimethylbenz-[α]antracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumorigenesis in F2[COP x Wistar-Furth]-intercross rats. Altogether, our results suggest at least three distinct susceptibility QTLs for irradiation-induced mammary tumorigenesis not detected in genetic studies of chemically-induced and hormone-induced mammary tumorigenesis. While more study is needed to identify the specific Mts-gene variants, elucidation of specific variant(s) could establish causal gene pathways involved in mammary tumorigenesis in humans, and hence novel pathways for therapy.",

Secondary cooperating genetic events are generally required for oncogene-induced tumorigenesis to overcome these biologic obstacles. We employed comparative genomic hybridization for eight genetically engineered mouse models of mammary cancer to identify loci that might harbor genes that enhance oncogene-induced tumorigenesis.;Unlike many other mammary tumor models, the MMTV-Myc tumors displayed few copy number variants except for amplification of distal mouse chromosome 11 in 80 % of the tumors (syntenic to human 17q23-qter often amplified in human breast cancer). Analyses of candidate genes located in this region identified JMJD6 as an epigenetic regulatory gene that cooperates with Myc to enhance tumorigenesis. It suppresses Myc-induced apoptosis under varying stress conditions through inhibition of p19ARF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein, leading to reduced levels of p53. JMJD6 binds to the p19ARF promoter and exerts its inhibitory function through demethylation of H4R3me2a. JMJD6 overexpression in MMTV-Myc cell lines increases tumor burden, induces EMT, and greatly enhances tumor metastasis. Importantly, we demonstrate that co-expression of high levels of JMJD6 and Myc is associated with poor prognosis for human ER+ breast cancer patients.;A novel epigenetic mechanism has been identified for how JMJD6 cooperates with Myc during oncogenic transformation. Combined high expression of Myc and JMJD6 confers a more aggressive phenotype in mouse and human tumors. Given the pleiotropic pro-tumorigenic activities of JMJD6, it may be useful as a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target for Myc-driven mammary tumorigenesis.",

Moreover, p16 has been shown to exert its function through inhibition of CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of pRB. Both genes have been found to be mutated or deleted in a wide range of primary human tumors and tumor cell lines. However, the presence of CDKN2/MTS1 containing nonneoplastic elements in every tumor specimen may contribute to the apparent lower deletion detection rate in resected neoplasms compared to cell lines. We have developed an immunohistochemical assay that allows us to assess p16 expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. As controls, we used paraffin-embedded pellets of cell lines with well-defined p16 status (four positive and four negative lines), as well as routinely processed nude mouse xenografts of two p16-positive cell lines. p16-negative cells were characterized by the absence of nuclear staining, whereas cytoplasmic staining was variable. In neoplastic and normal tissues, the level of p16 generally appeared to be low. We tested 75 random human malignancies from 4 different anatomic sites for p16 expression and correlated the findings with the immunohistochemical presence or absence of pRB. Twenty % of tumors selectively lacked pRB, while 37% of neoplasms had undetectable p16. In 43% of all carcinomas, both pRB and p16 could be detected. Significant differences existed in the expression of both tumor suppressor genes between carcinomas from different sites. Breast cancers had the highest rate of p16 negativity (13 of 20). Our data show that: (a) immunohistochemistry may be a suitable modality to screen for RB and CDKN2/MTS1 abnormalities in paraffin-embedded tissues; (b) undetectable levels of p16 expression occur at a relatively high frequency; (c) p16 and pRB expression in common human malignancies is not mutually exclusive; (d) loss of function of both tumor suppressor genes appears to be a distinctly uncommon phenomenon; and (e) different types of carcinomas have variable rates of disturbance in the p16/pRB pathway.",

Among these mutated genes, driver genes are defined as being causally linked to oncogenesis, while passenger genes are thought to be irrelevant for cancer development. With increasing numbers of large-scale genomic datasets available, integrating these genomic data to identify driver genes from aberration regions of cancer genomes becomes an important goal of cancer genome analysis and investigations into mechanisms responsible for cancer development. A computational method, MAXDRIVER, is proposed here to identify potential driver genes on the basis of copy number aberration (CNA) regions of cancer genomes, by integrating publicly available human genomic data. MAXDRIVER employs several optimization strategies to construct a heterogeneous network, by means of combining a fused gene functional similarity network, gene-disease associations and a disease phenotypic similarity network. MAXDRIVER was validated to effectively recall known associations among genes and cancers. Previously identified as well as novel driver genes were detected by scanning CNAs of breast cancer, melanoma and liver carcinoma. Three predicted driver genes (CDKN2A, AKT1, RNF139) were found common in these three cancers by comparative analysis. ",

Furthermore, the human Mdmx ortholog, Hdmx, was found to be overexpressed in a significant percentage of various human tumors and amplified in 5% of primary breast tumors, all of which retained wild-type p53. Hdmx was also amplified and highly expressed in MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line harboring wild-type p53, and interfering RNA-mediated reduction of Hdmx markedly inhibited the growth potential of these cells in a p53-dependent manner.

It is a prodrug that is converted by several cytochrome P450 enzymes to a primary metabolite, N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDT), which is then further modified by CYP2D6 to a pharmacologically potent secondary metabolite, 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen (endoxifen). Antidepressants (ADs), which are often coprescribed to patients receiving tamoxifen, are also metabolized by CYP2D6 and evidence suggests that a drug-drug interaction between these agents adversely affects the outcome of tamoxifen therapy by inhibiting endoxifen formation. We evaluated this potentially important drug-drug interaction in vivo in mice humanized for CYP2D6 (hCYP2D6). The rate of conversion of NDT to endoxifen by hCYP2D6 mouse liver microsomes (MLMs) in vitro was similar to that of the most active members of a panel of 13 individual human liver microsomes. Coincubation with quinidine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, ablated endoxifen generation by hCYP2D6 MLMs. The NDT-hydroxylation activity of wild-type MLMs was 7.4 times higher than that of hCYP2D6, whereas MLMs from Cyp2d knockout animals were inactive. Hydroxylation of NDT correlated with that of bufuralol, a CYP2D6 probe substrate, in the human liver microsome panel. In vitro, ADs of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class were, by an order of magnitude, more potent inhibitors of NDT hydroxylation by hCYP2D6 MLMs than were compounds of the tricyclic class. At a clinically relevant dose, paroxetine pretreatment inhibited the generation of endoxifen from NDT in hCYP2D6 mice in vivo. These data demonstrate the potential of ADs to affect endoxifen generation and, thereby, the outcome of tamoxifen therapy.",

However, not all tumors respond favorably to these drugs. CDK4 activity is critical for progression through G1 phase and into the mitotic cell cycle. Inhibiting this kinase induces Rb-positive cells to exit the cell cycle into either a quiescent or senescent state. In this report, using well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS) cell lines, we show that the proteolytic turnover of MDM2 is required for CDK4i-induced senescence. Failure to reduce MDM2 does not prevent CDK4i-induced withdrawal from the cell cycle but the cells remain in a reversible quiescent state. Reducing MDM2 in these cells drives them into the more stable senescent state. CDK4i-induced senescence associated with loss of MDM2 is also observed in some breast cancer, lung cancer and glioma cell lines indicating that this is not limited to WD/DDLS cells in which MDM2 is overexpressed or in cells that contain wild type p53. MDM2 turnover depends on its E3 ligase activity and expression of ATRX. Interestingly, in seven patients the changes in MDM2 expression were correlated with outcome. These insights identify MDM2 and ATRX as new regulators controlling geroconversion, the process by which quiescent cells become senescent, and this insight may be exploited to improve the activity of CDK4i in cancer therapy.",

Immunohistochemically, expression of 10 genes was assessed on the home-made tissue microarrays of tissues from 58 patients. The correlation of tumor specific changes with each of clinical-pathologic features was scrutinized with relevant statistic tools.;In comparison with the normal mucosa of the non-cancer patients, the following 14 genes displayed no tumor associated changes: breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1), cadherin 1, type 1, E-cadherin (epithelial) (CDH1), death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), melanoma antigen, family A, 1 (directs expression of antigen MZ2-E) (MAGEA1), tumor suppressor candidate 3 (N33), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21, Cip1) (p21(WAF1)), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27, Kip1) (p27(KIP1)), phosphatase and tensin homolog (mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1) (PTEN), retinoic acid receptor, beta (RAR- , Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family 1 C (RASSF1C), secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (Sorsby fundus dystrophy, pseudoinflammatory) (TIMP3), and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL). The rest 17 targets exhibited to various extents the tumor associated changes. As changes in methylation of the following genes occurred marginally, their impact on the formation of colorectal cancer were trivial: adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (8%, 5/65), Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family 1A (RASSF1A) (3%, 2/65) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, alternated reading frame (p14(ARF)) (6%, 4/65). The following genes exhibited moderate changes in methylation: O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) (20%, 13/65), mutL homolog 1, colon cancer, nonpolyposis type 2 (E. coli) (hMLH1) (18%, 12/65), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (melanoma, p16, inhibits CDK4) (p16(INK4a)) (10%, 10/65), methylated in tumor 1 (MINT1) (15%, 10/65), methylated in tumor 31 (MINT31) (11%, 7/65). The rest changed greatly in the methylation pattern in colorectal cancer (CRC): cyclin A1 (cyclin a1) (100%, 65/65), caudal type homeobox transcription factor 1 (CDX1) (100%, 65/65), RAR- (85%, 55/65), myogenic factor 3 (MYOD1) (69%, 45/65), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15, inhibits CDK4) (p15(INK4b)) (68%, 44/65), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase and cyclooxygenase) (COX2) (72%, 47/65), cadherin 13, H-cadherin (heart) (CDH13) (65%, 42/65), CAAX box 1 (CXX1) (58%, 38/65), tumor protein p73 (p73) (63%, 41/65) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) (58%, 38/65).

Melanoma genetic counseling is offered to families in order to better understand the disease and the genetic susceptibility of developing it.

Autocrine hGH promotes mammary carcinoma cell survival, proliferation, immortalization; it confers an invasive phenotype as a result of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contributes to chemoresistance and radioresistance. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is being successfully used as a first and second line therapy for the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. It also inhibits tumor cell growth and induces apoptosis in a broad range of solid tumors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hGH on sensitivity of a mammary adenocarcinoma cell to ATO, using a stable hGH-transfectant MCF-7 cell line, MCF7-hGH. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the overexpression of hGH increased sensitivity of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 to ATO through apoptotic and anti-proliferative mechanisms. The effect of ATO on the transcriptional level of genes involved in survival (Bcl-2, Bax and Survivin), self-sufficiency in growth signals (c-Myc, ARF, Cdc25A, p53 and Bax), immortalization (hTERT) and invasion and metastasis (MMP-2 and MMP-9, uPA and uPAR and E-cadherin) was more pronounced in MCF7-hGH compared with its parental MCF-7 line. Our study may highlight the potential application of ATO for the treatment of patients with breast cancer, especially in those who have metastatic and chemoresistant tumor phenotype possibly due to the over expression of hGH.",

The cellular effects of these vitamin A analogues have been primarily associated with induction of differentiation and inhibition of proliferation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bexarotene (LGD1069, Targretin), a rexinoid, can not only inhibit cell proliferation but also induce cellular senescence in mammary epithelial cells, premalignant lesions, and tumors of the MMTV-Neu model of mammary carcinogenesis, which develops estrogen receptor-negative tumors. Mice with palpable mammary tumors were treated for 4 weeks with bexarotene at 80 or 40 mg/kg body weight, and senescent cells were determined by SA-β-Gal assay. Bexarotene decreased in a dose-dependent manner the multiplicity of premalignant lesions and tumors, and this was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cellular senescence and apoptosis. By double labeling of senescent cells, first by SA-β-Gal and then by antibodies against genes related to cellular senescence, we found that p21, p16, and RARβ, but not p53, were upregulated by bexarotene in mammary tumors and in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting involvement of multiple signaling pathways in mediating the senescence program of rexinoids. These findings indicate that, in addition to cell proliferation and apoptosis, cellular senescence could be used as a potential biomarker of response in breast cancer prevention and therapy studies with rexinoids and possibly with other antitumor agents.",

Dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently observed in many types of cancer. Pathway activation can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including gene amplification or rearrangement, loss of negative regulators, epigenetic alterations, and point mutations in key pathway components. Due to the importance of CDK4/6 activity in cancer cells, CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Moreover, combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor with other targeted therapies may help overcome acquired or de novo treatment resistance. Ongoing studies include combinations of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancers, and with selective RAF and MEK inhibitors for tumors with alterations in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as melanoma. In particular, the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, such as palbociclib's recent first-line approval in combination with letrozole, is expected to transform the treatment of HR+ breast cancer. Currently, three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved or are in late-stage development: palbociclib (PD-0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219).

In this study, we investigated whether YB-1 is involved in regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation of human cancer cells. Treatment with YB-1 siRNA caused a marked suppression of cell proliferation and expression of a cell cycle related gene, CDC6 by cancer cells. Of cell cycle of cancer cells, S phase content was specifically reduced by knockdown of YB-1. The overexpression of CDC6 abrogated this inhibition of both cell proliferation and S phase entry. ChIP assay demonstrated that YB-1 binds to a Y-box located in the promoter region of the CDC6 gene. Expression of cyclin D1, CDK1 and CDK2 was also reduced with increased expression of p21(Cip1) and p16(INK4A) when treated with YB-1 siRNA. Furthermore, the nuclear YB-1 expression was significantly associated with the level of CDC6 nuclear expression in patients with breast cancer. In conclusion, YB-1 plays an important role in cell cycle progression at G1/S of human cancer cells. YB-1 thus could be a potent biomarker for tumour growth and cell cycle in its close association with CDC6.",

The methylation frequency of ten genes in serum of 50 SBCs varied from 10% in FHIT to 74% in RASSF1A. The methylation status of RASSF1A, BRCA1, p16, CDH1, ER, RARbeta2, APC, and DAPK was significantly correlated with SBC and nontumor serum (P < 0.05). Methylation of at least one gene was found in 92% SBC; CIMP was more frequent in SBC than nontumor serum (P < 0.001). There was a significant association between CIMP and methylation of RASSF1A, BRCA1, p16, CDH1, ER, RARbeta2, APC, and DAPK (P < 0.05); the methylation link profile of CDH1, RASSF1A, BRCA1, and RARbeta2 as breast cancer marker may contribute high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (88%). ER and RARbeta2 methylation was associated with elevated serum CA153 levels in 39 SBC samples with CIMP+ (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that living area of patients was found to provide independent prognostic information associated with a relative risk of tumor recurrence of 5.3.

In addition, 8 cases of male ductal carcinoma in situ and normal breast tissue obtained from autopsies (n=10) and adjacent to male breast cancer (n=5) were studied. Normal ductal male breast epithelial cells were very often ER and Bcl-2 positive (>69%), and progesterone receptor and androgen receptor expression was also common (>39%). Gynecomastia showed a consistent 3-layered pattern: 1 myoepithelial and 2 epithelial cell layers with a distinctive immunohistochemical staining pattern. The intermediate luminal layer, consisting of vertically oriented cuboidal-to-columnar cells, is hormone receptor positive and expresses Bcl-2 and cyclin D1. The inner luminal layer is composed of smaller cells expressing CK5 and often CK14 but is usually negative for hormone receptors and Bcl-2. Male ductal carcinoma in situ was consistently ER positive and CK5/CK14 negative. In conclusion, for the first time we describe the 3-layered ductal epithelium in gynecomastia, which has a distinctive immunohistochemical profile.

MTT, flow cytometry, western blotting, Real Time PCR were used to test anticancer and chemosensitizing effects of Nar, cell cycle, apoptosis, and expression of cell cycle, apoptosis, pro-survival and anti-survival-related genes.;In the present study, Thymus vulgaris ethanol extract was purified repeatedly to produce several compounds including the known flavanone, Nar which was identified using different spectral techniques. Nar was shown to inhibit both human colorectal and breast cancer cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner through cell cycle arrest at S- and G2/M-phases accompanied by an increase in apoptotic cell death. Additionally, Nar altered the expression of apoptosis and cell-cycle regulatory genes by down-regulating Cdk4, Cdk6, Cdk7, Bcl2, x-IAP and c-IAP-2 and up-regulating p18, p19, p21, caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9, Bak, AIF and Bax in both colorectal and breast cancer cells. Conversely, it diminished the expression levels of the cell survival factors PI3K, pAkt, pIκBα and NFκBp65. Moreover, Nar enhanced the sensitivity of colorectal and breast cancer cells to DNA-acting drugs.;These findings provide evidence that Nar's pro-apoptotic and chemo-sensitizing effects are mediated by perturbation of cell cycle, upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and inhibition of pro-survival signaling pathways.;In conclusion, Nar might be a promising candidate for chemoprevention and/or chemotherapy of human cancers.

When overexpressed in breast cancer cells, these forms of cyclin E induce genomic instability, resistance to inhibition by p21 and p27, and resistance to antiestrogen therapy. Additionally, the LMW forms of cyclin E strongly correlate with decreased survival in patients with breast cancer. However, the oncologic role of the LMW forms of cyclin E in breast cancer tumorigenesis is yet to be determined. To this end, we generated transgenic mice expressing full-length cyclin E alone (M46A), full-length and the EL4 isoforms (EL1/EL4), or the EL2/3 isoforms of cyclin E (T1) under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Compared with full-length cyclin E, LMW cyclin E overexpression induces delayed mammary growth during the pubertal phase and abnormal cell morphology during lactation. Both primary mammary tumor formation and metastasis were markedly enhanced in LMW cyclin E transgenic mice. LMW cyclin E overexpression in mammary epithelial cells of mice is sufficient by itself to induce mammary adenocarcinomas in 34 of 124 (27%) animals compared with 7 of 67 (10.4%) mice expressing only the full-length cyclin E (P < 0.05). In addition, metastasis was seen in 25% of LMW cyclin E tumor-bearing animals compared with only 8.3% of tumors in the full-length cyclin E background (P < 0.05). Moreover, LMW cyclin E overexpression selects for inactivation of p53 by loss of heterozygosity and spontaneous and frequent inactivation of ARF. Therefore, LMW cyclin E overexpression strongly selects for spontaneous inactivation of the ARF-p53 pathway in vivo, canceling its protective checkpoint function and accelerating progression to malignancy.",

The special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) has been identified as a key factor in the progression of breast cancer cells to a malignant phenotype and is associated with progression of human tumors. In normal development, SATB1 coordinates gene expression of progenitor cells by functioning as a genome organizer. In contrast to progenitor and tumor cells, SATB1 expression in nontransformed cells is not compatible with proliferation. Here we show that SATB1 expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts induces cell cycle arrest and senescence that is associated with elevated p16 protein levels. Deletion of p16 overcomes the SATB1-induced senescence. We further provide evidence for an interaction of SATB1 with the retinoblastoma (RB)/E2F pathway downstream of p16. A combined deletion of the RB proteins, RB, p107 and p130 (triple-mutant; TM), prevents SATB1-induced G1 arrest, which is restored upon the reintroduction of RB into SATB1-expressing TM fibroblasts. SATB1 interacts with the E2F/RB complex and regulates the cyclin E promoter in an E2F-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that p16 and the RB/E2F pathway are critical for SATB1-induced cell cycle arrest. In the absence of p16, SATB1 causes anchorage-independent growth and invasive phenotype in fibroblasts. Our data illustrate that p16 mutations collaborate with the oncogenic activity of SATB1. Consistent with our finding, a literature survey shows that deletion of p16 is generally associated with SATB1 expressing human cell lines and tumors. ",

Importantly, these molecular findings may fuel significant clues to cancer control.

Yet knowledge about its genetic and molecular pathology will hopefully ameliorate this vexing problem.

We provide a concise description of pancreatic cancer in concert with malignant melanoma in the familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome as a potential preventive model. This knowledge should help clinicians and basic scientists seize on the opportunity to develop more sensitive and specific screening and management programs in this disease; while a relatively small subset of pancreatic cancer may be readily identifiable through its FAMMM phenotype, coupled with its CDKN2A mutation, this hereditary disorder, given a keen knowledge of its natural history and molecular genetics, may prove to be an effective clinical preventive model.",

Of the nine major sites of DNA methylation in the amplified region from these tumour DNAs, four were in non-CG sequences. This unusual concentration of non-CG methylation sites was not a general phenomenon present throughout the genome of these tumour cells because the methylated CpG island regions of interspersed L1 repeats had a pattern of (almost exclusively) CG methylation similar to that found in normal breast tissue DNA and in DNA from tumours with unmethylated p16 genes.

As negative growth regulators, the cdk inhibitors may function as tumor suppressors. While the p16 gene plays a tumor suppressor role in cancers, p27 gene mutations have been identified only rarely. While high levels of p27 protein are expressed in normal human mammary epithelium, loss of p27 is frequent and is of independent prognostic significance in breast cancers. Low p27 is also a poor prognostic factor in colon, gastric, esophageal, lung, and prostate carcinomas, and enhanced proteasomal degradation may underlie loss of p27 in tumor cells. Loss of p27 has not been significantly correlated with tumor proliferation in a number of studies and may reflect alterations in differentiation and adhesion-dependent growth regulation germane to oncogenesis and tumor progression. Efforts to confirm the prognostic value of p27 are under way in a number of large breast cancer studies. These studies may also indicate whether loss of p27 in association with other traditional or novel markers has greater prognostic potential than each factor alone. p27 immunostaining is inexpensive and reliable and may become part of the routine histopathologic processing of tumors in the near future. Widespread application of p27 in prognostic testing will require greater uniformity in scoring techniques and determination of the cut off levels which distinguish individuals at high and low risk of cancer recurrence and death. Finally, the greatest utility of p27 may lie in the information it sheds on the biology of aberrant growth regulation in breast cancer and the potential to use this in the generation of novel therapeutic strategies.",

The rationale is that breast masses are often stiffer than healthy tissue; furthermore, malignant masses are stiffer than benign masses. The comb-push ultrasound shear elastography (CUSE) method is used to noninvasively assess a tissue's mechanical properties. CUSE utilizes a sequence of simultaneous multiple laterally spaced acoustic radiation force (ARF) excitations and detection to reconstruct the region of interest (ROI) shear wave speed map, from which a tissue stiffness property can be quantified. In this study, the tissue stiffnesses of 73 breast masses were interrogated. The mean shear wave speeds for benign masses (3.42 ± 1.32 m/s) were lower than malignant breast masses (6.04 ± 1.25 m/s). These speed values correspond to higher stiffness in malignant breast masses (114.9 ± 40.6 kPa) than benign masses (39.4 ± 28.1 kPa and p <; 0.001), when tissue elasticity is quantified by Young's modulus. A Young's modulus >83 kPa is established as a cut-off value for differentiating between malignant and benign suspicious breast masses, with a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 89.19% sensitivity, 88.69% specificity, and 0.911 for the area under the curve (AUC).",

        "Doc_abstract":"In the multistep progressive pathogenesis of human breast cancer, comedo ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) represents a preinvasive precursor lesion for therapy resistant invasive cancer. Human tissue derived cell culture models exhibiting molecular similarities to clinical DCIS facilitate an important preclinical mechanistic approach for evaluation of preventive efficacy of natural and synthetic chemopreventive compounds. Natural phytochemicals present in fresh fruits, vegetables and grain products are likely to offer protection against cancer. The clinical efficacy of these natural phytochemicals, however, depends on extrapolation, and is therefore equivocal. The present study determined whether the natural soy isoflavone genistein (GEN) inhibited aberrant proliferation in 184-B5/HER cells (a model for human comedo DCIS) and identified possible mechanisms responsible for its efficacy. Human reduction mammoplasty derived HER-2/neu oncogene expressing preneoplastic 184-B5/HER cells represented the experimental system. Flow cytometry and cellular epifluorescence based assays were utilized to quantitate the alterations in cell cycle progression, cellular apoptosis, and in the status of cell cycle regulatory and apoptosis-associated gene product expression. The 184-B5/HER cells exhibited specific immunofluorescence to p185HER, p53, EGFR, but not to ERalpha, thus resembling comedo DCIS. Treatment of 184-B5/HER cells with GEN resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the viable cell population, increase in the G0/G1:S + G2/M ratio and enhancement of sub G0/G1 (apoptotic population). Exposure to the maximum cytostatic 10 microM dose of GEN down-regulated HER-2/neu mediated signal transduction as evidenced by a 73.9% decrease (p=0.001) in p185HER specific, and a 89.8% decrease (p=0.001) in phosphotyrosine specific immunofluorescence. The increase in G0/G1:S + G2/M ratio in response to the treatment with 10 microM GEN was associated with a 85.5% decrease (p=0.001) in immunoreactivity to PCNA and a 128.6% increase (p=0.004) in immunoreactivity to the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4. The induction of apoptosis by GEN was associated with a 52.8% decrease (p=0.001) in the immunoreactivity to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and with a 195.9% (p=0.001) increase in the immunoreactivity to proapoptotic Bax. Thus, preventive efficacy of GEN in HER-2/neu+/ER- 184-B5/HER cells may be due to its ability to down-regulate HER-2/neu mediated signal transduction, increase the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4, and induce Bcl-2 dependent apoptosis. These data provide evidence that GEN may be a potential chemopreventive lead compound for human comedo DCIS. The 184-B5/HER cells, may therefore, provide a high throughput mechanistic bioassay to identify new chemopreventive agents for human breast cancer.",

However, patients with a unique subset of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated HNSCC have been documented to have a better survival outcome. These tumors occur more frequently in the tonsils and oropharyngeal sites, among younger patients, higher socioeconomic group, and those exposed to more sexual partners and oral sex compared with HPV-negative HNSCC. Although tobacco- and alcohol-related HNSCCs appear to be on the decline, tonsillar and oropharyngeal HPV-associated tumors seem to be on the rise, and their prevalence varies widely in published reports, ranging from 20% to 60%. Human papilloma virus detection methods in tumor tissue vary and include polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization (ISH) technique for HPV DNA, and E6/E7 messenger RNA, with p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a surrogate marker. The sensitivity and specificity of the different methods used are likely contributory factors to this wide variation. This study compares the p16 IHC staining patterns in HNSCC and laryngeal papillomas and assesses the concordance of p16 and high-risk HPV-ISH to determine the usefulness of p16 as a first-line marker. Using an objective criterion of diffuse intense confluent staining pattern as definite positive (akin to the 3+ of HER2/neu in breast cancer) and focal scattered staining pattern as equivocal reaction requiring confirmatory HPV assay, p16 IHC expression shows good concordance with high-risk HPV-ISH and can be used as a first-line marker.

Importantly, the highly related T-box factors Tbx2 and Tbx3 can suppress senescence through repressing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p19(ARF) and p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDII). Furthermore, Tbx2 is up-regulated in several cancers, including melanomas where it was shown to function as an anti-senescence factor, suggesting that this may be one of the mechanisms by which T-box proteins contribute to the oncogenic process. However, very little is known about whether Tbx2 is regulated by p21-mediated stress-induced senescence signaling pathways. In this study, using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line known to overexpress Tbx2, we show that in response to stress induced by ultraviolet irradiation the Tbx2 protein is specifically phosphorylated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro kinase assays, we have identified serine residues 336, 623, and 675 in the Tbx2 protein as the p38 target sites and show that these sites are phosphorylated in vivo. Importantly, we show by Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and reporter assays that this phosphorylation leads to increased Tbx2 protein levels, predominant nuclear localization of the protein, and an increase in the ability of Tbx2 to repress the p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDII) promoter. These results show for the first time that the ability of Tbx2 to repress the p21 gene is enhanced in response to a stress-induced senescence pathway, which leads to a better understanding of the regulation of the anti-senescence function of Tbx2.",

According to one model, proliferation of telomerase(-) pre-malignant cells leads to telomere dysfunction and increased genomic instability. Such instability leads in rare cases to reactivation of telomerase and immortalization. The mechanism of telomerase reactivation remains unknown. We have studied immortalization of cultured human mammary epithelial cells by c-Myc, a positive transcriptional regulator of the hTERT gene encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase. Retrovirally introduced c-Myc cDNA resulted in immortalization of human mammary epithelial cells in which the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p16(INK4A), was inactivated by an shRNA-encoding retrovirus. However, while c-Myc introduction immediately resulted in increased activity of transiently transfected hTERT promoter reporter constructs, endogenous hTERT mRNA levels did not change until about 60 population doublings after c-Myc introduction. Increased endogenous hTERT transcripts and stabilization of telomeric DNA in cells expressing exogenous c-Myc coincided with telomere dysfunction-associated senescence in control cultures. Genome copy number analyses of immortalized cells indicated amplifications of some or all of chromosome 5, where hTERT genes are located. hTERT gene copy number, however, was not increased in one case. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in chromosome 5, while not necessarily increasing hTERT gene copy number, resulted in removal of repressive chromatin structures around hTERT loci, allowing induction of hTERT transcription. These in vitro results model one possible sequence of events leading to immortalization of breast epithelial cells during cancer progression.",

Bmi-1 overexpression alone in MCF10A cells did not result in oncogenic transformation. However, Bmi-1 co-overexpression with activated H-Ras (RasG12V) resulted in efficient transformation of MCF10A cells in vitro. Although early-passage H-Ras-expressing MCF10A cells were not transformed, late-passage H-Ras-expressing cells exhibited features of transformation in vitro. Early- and late-passage H-Ras-expressing cells also differed in levels of expression of H-Ras and Ki-67, a marker of proliferation. Subsets of early-passage H-Ras-expressing cells exhibited high Ras expression and were negative for Ki-67, whereas most late-passage H-Ras-expressing cells expressed low levels of Ras and were Ki-67 positive. Injection of late-passage H-Ras-expressing cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice formed carcinomas with leiomatous, hemangiomatous, and mast cell components; these tumors were quite distinct from those induced by late-passage cells co-overexpressing Bmi-1 and H-Ras, which formed poorly differentiated carcinomas with spindle cell features. Bmi-1 and H-Ras co-overexpression in MCF10A cells also induced features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Importantly, Bmi-1 inhibited senescence and permitted proliferation of cells expressing high levels of Ras.

Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

We selected 116 consecutive premenopausal patients with TNBC to compare the immunohistochemical profile of the group rich in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with those without this characteristic.;We reviewed all the original histological sections to assess pathological features, and to select a representative area for tissue microarrays and immunohistochemical study. Estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2 and Ki-67 were evaluated in whole histological sections. The following markers were analyzed in tissue microarrays sections: androgen receptor, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin 14, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vimentin, p16, claudin-3, -4, and -7, p63, and aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1). Lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) was defined by the presence of more than 50% of lymphocytes in the intratumoral stroma.;Twenty-six (22.4%) patients present tumors classified as LPBC and 90 (77.6%) as non-LPBC. The two groups were similar regarding age of patients, tumor grade and Ki-67 positive cells. LPBC cases presented lower frequency of expression of the basal cytokeratins, EGFR, and basal-like immunoprofile. There was a trend to higher expression of ALDH1 by stromal intratumoral cells. The expression of all other markers were similar in the two groups.;Lymphocyte-predominant TNBC in premenopausal patients are mostly of non-basal phenotype.",

The functional requirement of Hox cofactors in the oncogenic activity of HoxB7 was proven with a dominant-negative Pbx1 mutant, Pbx1NT, which sequesters Prep1 in the cytoplasm. The less aggressive phenotype of the SkBr3/B7/PbxNT cells, evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo, correlated well with increased apoptosis, decreased cycling and up-regulation of p16 and p53.

Therefore, mammary nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) may become a specific target for novel anti-breast cancer therapies. Toward this goal, we investigated the difference in the ACh receptor repertoires between normal and malignant BECs, determined effects of nicotinic ligands on 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells, and characterized reciprocal effects of NNK and SLURP (secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1)-1 on the expression of nAChR subunits and several oncogenes and tumor-suppressing genes in BECs. Both the non-malignant MCF10A and malignant MCF7 breast cells expressed α3, α5, α7, α9, α10, β1, β2, γ, δ and ε nAChR subunits and M(1), M(3), M(4) and M(5) muscarinic receptor subtypes. The malignancy was associated with expression of α1, α4 and β4 nAChR subunits and M(2) subtype. Malignant transformation of BECs was also associated with overexpression of α7-, and α9-made nAChRs. NNK upregulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, stimulated expression of the gene encoding the tumor-promoter HGF, downregulated expression of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, and induced tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells. Compared to the canonical nAChR antagonists, SLURP-1 showed the highest ability to abolish the nAChR-mediated effects of NNK in both cell-signaling and cell-transformation assays and reversed many effects of NNK on gene expression. SLURP-1 also markedly upregulated the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2B, RUNX3 and TP73. Altogether, the obtained results provided new insight into the molecular mechanisms of nAChR-mediated oncogenic effects of NNK on BECs and demonstrated the ability to abolish or reverse these effects by SLURP-1.",

The isolation of TICs has been limited by the scarcity of this population in the tissue of origin and because the molecular signatures that characterize these cells are not well understood. Herein, we describe the generation of TIC-like cell lines by ectopic expression of the OCT4 transcription factor (TF) in primary breast cell preparations.;OCT4 cDNA was over-expressed in four different primary human mammary epithelial (HMEC) breast cell preparations from reduction mammoplasty donors. OCT4-transduced breast cells (OTBCs) generated colonies (frequency ~0.01%) in self-renewal conditions (feeder cultures in human embryonic stem cell media). Differentiation assays, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry were performed to investigate the cell of origin of OTBCs. Serial dilutions of OTBCs were injected in nude mice to address their tumorigenic capabilities. Gene expression microarrays were performed in OTBCs, and the role of downstream targets of OCT4 in maintaining self-renewal was investigated by knock-down experiments.;OTBCs overcame senescence, overexpressed telomerase, and down-regulated p16INK4A. In differentiation conditions, OTBCs generated populations of both myoepithelial and luminal cells at low frequency, suggesting that the cell of origin of some OTBCs was a bi-potent stem cell. Injection of OTBCs in nude mice generated poorly differentiated breast carcinomas with colonization capabilities. Gene expression microarrays of OTBC lines revealed a gene signature that was over-represented in the claudin-low molecular subtype of breast cancer. Lastly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of OCT4 or downstream embryonic targets of OCT4, such as NANOG and ZIC1, suppressed the ability of OTBCs to self-renew.;Transduction of OCT4 in normal breast preparations led to the generation of cell lines possessing tumor-initiating and colonization capabilities. These cells developed high-grade, poorly differentiated breast carcinomas in nude mice. Genome-wide analysis of OTBCs outlined an embryonic TF circuitry that could be operative in TICs, resulting in up-regulation of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressive functions. These OTBCs represent a patient-specific model system for the discovery of novel oncogenic targets in claudin-low tumors.",

Associations between methylation status and variables were tested using Fisher's exact test or logistic regression.

An association was seen for women who developed BC on study and RASSF1A methylation (P = 0.001 for sample level).;Genetic methylation patterns could potentially be used to predict future BC risk.

Curcumin, obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has potent anticancer activity. To date, no study has examined the interaction of PhIP with curcumin in breast epithelial cells. The present study demonstrates the mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits PhIP-induced cytotoxicity in normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). Curcumin significantly inhibited PhIP-induced DNA adduct formation and DNA double stand breaks with a concomitant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The expression of Nrf2, FOXO targets; DNA repair genes BRCA-1, H2AFX and PARP-1; and tumor suppressor P16 was studied to evaluate the influence on these core signaling pathways. PhIP induced the expression of various antioxidant and DNA repair genes. However, co-treatment with curcumin inhibited this expression. PhIP suppressed the expression of the tumor suppressor P16 gene, whereas curcumin co-treatment increased its expression. Caspase-3 and -9 were slightly suppressed by curcumin with a consequent inhibition of cell death. These results suggest that curcumin appears to be an effective anti-PhIP food additive likely acting through multiple molecular targets. ",

Here we show that forced expression of occludin induces anoikis and promotes oxidative stress-induced premature senescence in breast carcinoma cells, which is accompanied by upregulation of negative cell cycle regulators such as p16(INK4A), p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) but not p53. The senescent phenotype is reversed by specific inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Endogenous reexpression of occludin mediated by a synergistic effect with a demethylator and histone deacetylase inhibitor or retinoids that stimulate retinoic acid receptor alpha is also sufficient for provoking the senescent phenotype. In addition, tumors that developed from occludin-expressing cells in mice showed a feature of cellular senescence that has not been described as a consequence of occludin signaling. These findings suggest that the loss of occludin expression is at least partially involved in the senescence-escape program during mammary tumorigenesis.",

Medium conditioned by confluent P19 EPI-7 cultures is able to enhance clonal outgrowth of this cell line, suggesting that autocrine growth factor loops may be acting in these cells. Analysis of conditioned serum-free medium shows that this cell line produces a platelet-derived growth factor-like growth factor, next to a type beta transforming growth factor and large amounts of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and an IGF-binding protein with high specificity for IGF-II. This latter observation has been confirmed by the use of a specific bioassay for IGFs, based on their ability to specifically stimulate proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The amount of IGF-II produced (0.5 mg/liter conditioned medium) makes P19 EPI-7 one of the best producing cell lines for this factor described so far. Receptor cross-linking analysis shows that this cell line contains IGF-I receptors, but no specific receptors for IGF-II. Depending on the conditions tested, transforming growth factor-beta 1 either act as a growth-stimulating factor or as a strong growth inhibitory factor.

Such a gene hypermethylation has become a useful molecular marker for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of cancer patients. Our objective is to analyze the patterns of gene hypermethylation in patients with gynecological tumors.;We selected 115 patients with gynecological cancers: 22 ovarian; 13 endometrial, 11 cervical-uterine and 69 breast cancers. By testing methylation-specific PCR, we studied the methylation status of genes CDNK2A (p16), APC1A, FHIT, CDH1 and hMLH1.;The frequencies of gene methylation in genes p16, APC1A, FHIT, hMLH1 and CDH1 were 29.2%, 34%, 60.4%, 10.9% and 79.8%, respectively. 70% of cases showed at least two methylated genes, which means a rate of methylation >0.4. The lowest frequency of methylation was seen in ovarian cancer, while the highest one was observed in endometrial cancer.;The results indicate that the aberrant methylation of the promoter region is an important event in carcinogenesis of gynecological tumors and that the pattern of gene methylation is associated with the nature of the tumor. These particular characteristics can deliver relevant information on the major metabolic pathways altered in each tumor type. In addition to complementary studies (ie, loss of expression and/or function), this represents a clinical tool for the proper management of the disease.",

The purpose of the current study was to compare tumor characteristics and cell cycle alterations in AA women and white women that might affect the aggressiveness of breast carcinoma.;The study included 124 AA and 397 white women, ages 20-54 years. These women were enrolled in a case-control study in Atlanta, Georgia, between 1990 and 1992. Breast tumor specimens obtained from these women were centrally reviewed for histologic characteristics and evaluated for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR), c-ErbB-2, Ki-67, p53, cyclin E, cyclin D1, p27, p16, pRb, and p21 by immunohistochemistry. Logistic regression models were used to assess the age- and stage-adjusted associations of various tumor characteristics with race.;The odds of a breast carcinoma diagnosis at a younger age and at a later stage were higher for AA women than for white women. After adjustment for disease stage and age at diagnosis, AA women also were found to have increased odds of having a higher-grade tumor, a higher mitotic index, marked tumor necrosis, ductal histology, loss of ER and PR, overexpression of cyclin E, p16, and p53 and low expression of cyclin D1 at diagnosis.;The observed differences between tumor specimens obtained from AA women and tumor specimens obtained from white women, independent of stage and age at diagnosis, indicated that race may be a determinant, or a surrogate for other determinants, of aggressive breast carcinoma and specific cell cycle defects.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that primarily repress target mRNAs. Here, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 were selected as representative cardio-miRs that are upregulated in human heart failure. To bridge the gap between miRNA studies in cardiology and oncology, the targets and functions of these miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and cancers will be reviewed. ACVR1B, BCL2, BIM, eNOS, FGFR3, JPH2, MEN1, MYC, p16, and ST7L are miR-24 targets that have been experimentally validated in human cells. ARID3B, BAK1, BCL2, BMPR1B, ERBB2, FGFR2, IL6R, MUC1, SITR7, Smoothened, STAT3, TET2, and TP53 are representative miR-125b targets. ACVR2A, BCL2, CCND1, E2F3, GLUT3, MYB, RAF1, VEGF, WEE1, and WNT7A are representative miR-195 targets. BCL2L2, ß-catenin, BIM, CADM1, EZH2, FGFR1, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, and TWIST1 are representative miR-214 targets. miR-125b is a good cardio-miR that protects cardiomyocytes; miR-195 is a bad cardio-miR that elicits cardiomyopathy and heart failure; miR-24 and miR-214 are bi-functional cardio-miRs. By contrast, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 function as oncogenic or tumor suppressor miRNAs in a cancer (sub)type-dependent manner. Circulating miR-24 is elevated in diabetes, breast cancer and lung cancer. Circulating miR-195 is elevated in acute myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal adenoma. Circulating miR-125b and miR-214 are elevated in some cancers. Cardio-miRs and onco-miRs bear some similarities in functions and circulation profiles. miRNAs regulate WNT, FGF, Hedgehog and other signaling cascades that are involved in orchestration of embryogenesis and homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of human diseases. Because circulating miRNA profiles are modulated by genetic and environmental factors and are dysregulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations in somatic cells, circulating miRNA association studies (CMASs) within several thousands of cases each for common non-cancerous diseases and major cancers are necessary for miRNA-based diagnostics.

Here we report the identification of a specific association of Mdm2 with Mre11, Nbs1, and Rad50, a DNA double strand break repair complex. Mdm2 bound to the Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 complex in primary cells and in cells containing inactivated p53 or p14/p19ARF, a regulator of Mdm2. Further analysis revealed that Mdm2 directly bound to Nbs1 but not to Mre11 or Rad50. Amino acids 198-314 of Mdm2 were required for Mdm2/Nbs1 association, and neither the N terminus forkhead-associated and breast cancer C-terminal domains nor the C terminus Mre11 binding domain of Nbs1 mediated the interaction of Nbs1 with Mdm2. Mdm2 co-localized with Nbs1 to sites of DNA damage following gamma-irradiation. Notably, Mdm2 overexpression inhibited DNA double strand break repair, and this was independent of p53 and ARF, the alternative reading frame of the Ink4alocus. The delay in DNA repair imposed by Mdm2 required the Nbs1 binding domain of Mdm2, but the ubiquitin ligase domain in Mdm2 was dispensable. Therefore, Nbs1 is a novel p53-independent Mdm2 binding protein and links Mdm2 to the Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50-regulated DNA repair response.",

Recently, the convergence of DNA damage response and EMT in cancer development has received a great amount of scientific attention. Here, we showed that EMT is induced by the downregulation of RAP80, a well-known regulator for DNA damage response. The knockdown of RAP80 leads to EMT-like morphological changes and the increase of tumor sphere formation in non-adhesive culture. Mechanistically, RAP80 controls a reciprocal regulatory axis of ZEB1 (for EMT activation) and miR200c (for EMT inhibition). The downregulation of RAP80 increases ZEB1 protein and decreases miR200c expression to activate EMT signaling in the form of drastic inhibitions of E-cadherin, p16 and p21 expression. Using in vivo metastasis analysis, RAP80 knockdown cells are shown to dramatically metastasize into the lung and generate more malignant phenotype compared to controls. Interestingly, the expression level of RAP80 was positively correlated with the survival rate in lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients. These findings indicate that RAP80 is a critical gatekeeper in impeding EMT-induced metastasis and malignant phenotypes of cancer as well as preserving DNA integrity. ",

Yet, a number of studies have reported the presence of molecular abnormalities in some forms of APM suggesting a possible oncogenic potential for some of these lesions. We currently investigate the role of some of the cell cycle proteins, previously reported to be de-regulated in breast cancer, in an attempt to assess their significance in APM. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin A, p27, p21, p16, pRb and Ki-67 was examined in 93 cases of APM. The cases were divided into nonpapillary (NAPM) (30 cases) and papillary metaplasia (PAPM) (63 cases). PAPM was further subdivided into simple papillary (SPAPM) (29 cases), complex papillary (28 cases) and highly complex papillary (six cases). For statistical analysis, the last two groups were merged together (CPAPM). The results showed that increased histological complexity was associated with significant increase of proliferative capacity and alterations of the cell cycle control. The median Ki-67 index was 1.5% in SPAPM and 4.8% in the CPAPM. Also, alterations of the cell cycle regulators were significantly higher in the CPAPM than in the SPAPM. NAPM was generally similar to normal breast epithelium. Apocrine cells were negative for p16 while pRb was expressed in all cases. These findings suggest that in complex forms of APM, there is a considerable degree of cellular unrest. This may contribute to increased susceptibility to carcinogenesis.",

Quantitative methylation specific (qMS)-PCR was conducted on three specimen sets: 44 malignant (CA) and 34 normal (NL) tissue specimens, 18 matched CA, adjacent normal (ANL) tissue and NAF specimens, and 119 MD specimens. Training and validation tissue sets were analyzed to determine the optimal group of cancer predictive genes for NAF and MD analysis. NAF and MD cytologic review were also performed. Methylation of CCND-2, p16, RAR-beta and RASSF-1a was significantly more prevalent in tumor than in normal tissue specimens. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.96. For the 18 matched CA, ANL and NAF specimens, the four predictive genes identified in cancer tissue contained increased methylation in CA vs. ANL tissue; NAF samples had higher methylation than ANL specimens. Methylation frequency was higher in MD specimens from breasts with cancer than benign samples for p16 and RASSF-1a. In summary, i) routine quantitative DNA methylation assessment in NAF and MD samples is possible, and ii) genes hypermethylated in malignant breast tissue are also altered in matched NAF and in MD samples, and may be useful to assist in early breast cancer detection.",

Exploring the growth-inhibitory mechanisms of MR-5, we found that it is accompanied by G1 cell cycle arrest, which coincides with a marked inhibition of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins, including decreased cyclins (D1/D3/E) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2/4/6) and increased CDK inhibitors (CKIs) such as p15, p16, p21, and p27. Furthermore, the increase in CKI levels by MR-5 resulted in a concomitant increase in their interactions of CDK4 and CDK2, along with a strong inhibition in CDK4 kinase activity and the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb. MR-5 also modulated some critical kinase activities related to cell cycle regulation, including Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in MCF-7 cells.

Tumor specificity of methylation was validated through comparison of 14 lung cancer cell lines to normal human bronchial epithelial cells derived from bronchoscopy of 20 cancer-free smokers. Twenty-five genes were methylated in 11-81% of primary tumors. Prevalence for methylation of TNFRSF10C, BHLHB5 and BOLL was significantly higher in adenocarcinomas from never smokers than smokers. The relation between methylation of individual genes was examined using pairwise comparisons. A significant association was seen between 138 (42%) of the possible 325 pairwise comparisons. Most notably, methylation of MMP2, BHLHB4 or p16 was significantly associated with methylation of 16-19 other genes, thus predicting for a widespread methylation phenotype. Kaplan-Meier log-rank test and proportional hazard models identified a significant association between methylation of SULF2 (a pro-growth, -angiogenesis and -migration gene) and better patient survival (hazard ratio = 0.23). These results demonstrate a high degree of commonality for targeted silencing of genes between lung and other solid tumors and suggest that promoter hypermethylation in cancer is a highly co-ordinated event.",

For the sake of simplicity, we have classified the multiplicity of genetic abnormalities in five repertoires that are rapidly assessable and useful for stratification in clinical trials: allelic imbalance, aberrant promoter methylation, gene mRNA overexpression, microtubule alterations, and polymorphisms. Allelic imbalance refers to chromosomal instability, which is a major feature of cancer, and innovative techniques used in colorectal cancer should also be implemented in lung cancer. Epigenetic changes (variations in transcription levels) have been extensively studied in non-small cell lung cancer. Methylation techniques have shown that these epigenetic changes commonly occur at the same frequency in numerous genes, both well-known ( FHIT, APC, p16 ) and recently discovered ( TMS1, RASSF1 ) in non-small cell lung cancer and in breast cancer. Innovative techniques like quantitative polymerase chain reaction can determine gene expression profiles, mainly overexpression of mRNAs, which may be related to resistance to specific cytotoxic drugs. In the near future, we hope these profiles can be used to individualize chemotherapy. Multiple microtubule alterations related to overexpression of different genes can also be used to predict response to taxanes and Vinca alkaloids. Finally, the assessment of polymorphisms could enable us to understand their functional consequences in chemotherapy response.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Replicative senescence may be an important tumor suppressive mechanism for human cells. We investigated the mechanism of cell cycle arrest at senescence in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) that have undergone a period of 'self-selection', and as a consequence exhibit diminished p16INK4A levels. As HMECs approached senescence, the proportion of cells with a 2N DNA content increased and that in S phase decreased progressively. Cyclin D1-cdk4, cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 activities were not abruptly inhibited, but rather diminished steadily with increasing population age. In contrast to observations in fibroblast, p21Cip1 was not increased at senescence in HMECs. There was no increase in p27Kip1 levels nor in KIP association with targets cdks. While p15INK4B and its binding to both cdk4 and cdk6 increased with increasing passage, some cyclin D1-bound cdk4 and cdk6 persisted in senescent cells, whose inhibition could not be attributed to p15INK4B. The inhibition of cyclin E-cdk2 in senescent HMECs was accompanied by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk2, in association with a progressive loss of Cdc25A. Recombinant Cdc25A strongly reactivated cyclin E-cdk2 from senescent HMECs suggesting that reduction of Cdc25A contributes to cyclin E-cdk2 inhibition and G1 arrest at senescence. Although ectopic expression of Cdc25A failed to extend the lifespan of HMECs, the exogenous Cdc25A appeared to lack activity in these cells, since it neither shortened the G1-to-S phase interval nor activated cyclin E-cdk2. In contrast, in the breast cancer-derived MCF-7 line, Cdc25A overexpression increased both cyclin E-cdk2 activity and the S phase fraction. Thus, mechanisms leading to HMEC immortalization may involve not only the re-induction of Cdc25A expression, but also activation of this phosphatase.",

Proper initiation by RNA pol III requires the transcription factor TFIIIB. Gene-external U6 snRNA transcription requires TFIIIB consisting of Bdp1, TBP, and Brf2. Transcription from the gene-internal tRNA promoter requires TFIIIB composed of Bdp1, TBP, and Brf1. TFIIIB is a target of tumor suppressors, including PTEN, ARF, p53, and RB, and RB-related pocket proteins. Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) tumor suppressor plays a role in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, genome integrity, and ubiquitination. BRCA1 has a conserved amino-terminal RING domain, an activation domain 1 (AD1), and an acidic carboxyl-terminal domain (BRCA1 C-terminal region). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TFIIB interacts with the BRCA1 C-terminal region domain of Fcp1p, an RNA polymerase II phosphatase. The TFIIIB subunits Brf1 and Brf2 are structurally similar to TFIIB. Hence, we hypothesize that RNA pol III may be regulated by BRCA1 via the TFIIB family members Brf1 and Brf2. Here we report that: (1) BRCA1 inhibits both VAI (tRNA) and U6 snRNA RNA pol III transcription; (2) the AD1 of BRCA1 is responsible for inhibition of U6 snRNA transcription, whereas the RING domain and AD1 of BRCA1 are required for VAI transcription inhibition; and (3) overexpression of Brf1 and Brf2 alleviates inhibition of U6 snRNA and VAI transcription by BRCA1. Taken together, these data suggest that BRCA1 is a general repressor of RNA pol III transcription.",

Compared with normal tissue, expression of many DNA replication/repair and cell proliferation genes was increased in CIN1/CIN2 lesions and further sustained in CIN3, consistent with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced tumor suppressor inactivation. The CIN3-to-CxCa transition showed metabolic shifts, including decreased expression of mitochondrial electron transport complex components and ribosomal protein genes. Significantly, despite clinical, epidemiological, and animal model results linking estrogen and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) to CxCa, ERα expression declined >15-fold from normalcy to cancer, showing the strongest inverse correlation of any gene with the increasing expression of p16, a marker for HPV-linked cancers. This drop in ERα in CIN and tumor cells was confirmed at the protein level. However, ERα expression in stromal cells continued throughout CxCa development. Our further studies localized stromal ERα to FSP1+, CD34+, SMA- precursor fibrocytes adjacent to normal and precancerous CIN epithelium, and FSP1-, CD34-, SMA+ activated fibroblasts in CxCas. Moreover, rank correlations with ERα mRNA identified IL-8, CXCL12, CXCL14, their receptors, and other angiogenesis and immune cell infiltration and inflammatory factors as candidates for ERα-induced stroma-tumor signaling pathways. The results indicate that estrogen signaling in cervical cancer has dramatic differences from ERα+ breast cancers, and imply that estrogen signaling increasingly proceeds indirectly through ERα in tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts.

Although these studies suggest that they may both contribute to the oncogenic process by repressing common targets, whether they have redundant or distinct roles in cancers where they are both overexpressed remains to be elucidated. Importantly, when Tbx2 function is inhibited in melanoma cells lacking Tbx3, the cells senesce, but whether this is possible in melanoma cells overexpressing both proteins is not known. An understanding of this issue may have important implications for the design of an effective pro-senescence therapy. In this study, the authors used a sh-RNA approach to knock down TBX2 and TBX3 individually in 2 human melanoma cell lines that overexpress both these factors and then examined their specific involvement in the oncogenic process. They demonstrate, using in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation, as well as colony- and tumor-forming ability and cell motility assays, that TBX2 and TBX3 have distinct roles in melanoma progression. In the tested lines, although TBX2 could promote proliferation and transformation and was required by primary melanoma cells for immortality, TBX3 was required for tumor formation and cell migration. These findings were reproducible in a human breast cancer cell line, which confirms that TBX2 and TBX3, although highly homologous, do not have redundant roles in the transformation process of cancers where they are both overexpressed. These results have important implications for the development of new cancer treatments and in particular for melanoma, which is a highly aggressive and intractable cancer.",

Complete data were obtained for 586 patients. The predictive value of the markers was first analyzed individually by univariate analysis (log rank test) in 586 node-negative tumors, according to metastatic status during follow-up. Twenty-seven markers had significant prognostic value. ROC curve analysis (logistic regression) was then used to determine the marker combination that best classified the patients with and without metastases. A 15-marker signature (Bcl2, P16, P21, P27, P53, CD34, CA IX, c-kit, FGF-R1, P38, JAK, pSTAT3, CK9, STAT1 and ER) correctly classified 84.8% of the patients (sensitivity 85.5%, specificity 84.6%). When ER, PR and c-erb B2 were excluded from the analysis, a very similar signature, in which CK8-18 replaced ER, correctly classified 83.6% of the patients (sensitivity 84.5%, specificity 83.4%). These results show that quantitative immunoprofiling, independently of ER, PR and c-erb B2 status, can provide a basal-like signature, can properly predict the metastatic risk of node-negative breast carcinomas at diagnostic time.

        "Doc_abstract":"Phospholipase D (PLD) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline. PLD regulation in cells falls into two major signaling categories. One is via growth factors/mitogens, such as EGF, PDGF, insulin, and serum, and implicates tyrosine kinases; the other is via the small GTPase proteins Arf and Rho. We summarize here our lab's and other groups' contributions to those pathways and introduce several novel concepts. For the mitogen-induced signaling, new data indicate that an increase in cell transformation in PLD2-overexpressing cells is due to an increase of de novo DNA synthesis induced by PLD2, with the specific tyrosine residues involved in those functions being Y179 and Y511. Recent research has also implicated Grb2 in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2 that also involves Sos and the ERK pathway. The targets of phosphorylation within the PLD2 molecule that are key to its regulation have recently been precisely mapped. They are Y296, Y415, and Y511 and the responsible kinases are, respectively, EGFR, JAK3, and Src. Y296 is an inhibitory site and its phosphorylation explains the low PLD2 activity that exists in low-invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Advances along the small GTPase front have implicated cell migration, as PLD1 and PLD2 cause an increase in chemotaxis of leukocytes and inflammation. PA is necessary for full chemotaxis. PA enriches the localization of the atypical guanine exchange factor (GEF), DOCK2, at the leading edge of polarized neutrophils. Further, extracellular PA serves as a neutrophil chemoattractant; PA enters the cell and activates the mTOR/S6K pathway (specifically, S6K). A clear connection between PLD with the mTOR/S6K pathway has been established, in that PA binds to mTOR and also binds to S6K independently of mTOR. Lastly, there is evidence in the upstream direction of cell signaling that mTOR and S6K keep PLD2 gene expression function down-regulated in basal conditions. In summary, the involvement of PLD2 in cell signaling continues to expand geometrically. It involves gene transcription, mitogenic and cell migration effects as seen in normal growth, tumor development, and inflammation.",

The levels of the cell cycle CDKs are generally constant and their activities are controlled by cyclins, proteins whose levels oscillate during each cell cycle. Additional CDK family members were subsequently discovered that play significant roles in a wide range of activities including the control of gene transcription, metabolism, and neuronal function. In response to mitogenic stimuli, cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle produce cyclins of the D type that activate CDK4/6. These activated enzymes catalyze the monophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Then CDK2-cyclin E catalyzes the hyperphosphorylation of Rb that promotes the release and activation of the E2F transcription factors, which in turn lead to the generation of several proteins required for cell cycle progression. As a result, cells pass through the G1-restriction point and are committed to complete cell division. CDK2-cyclin A, CDK1-cyclin A, and CDK1-cyclin B are required for S, G2, and M-phase progression. Increased cyclin or CDK expression or decreased levels of endogenous CDK inhibitors such as INK4 or CIP/KIP have been observed in various cancers. In contrast to the mutational activation of EGFR, Kit, or B-Raf in the pathogenesis of malignancies, mutations in the CDKs that cause cancers are rare. Owing to their role in cell proliferation, CDKs represent natural targets for anticancer therapies. Abemaciclib (LY2835219), ribociclib (Lee011), and palbociclib (Ibrance(®) or PD0332991) target CDK4/6 with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors bind in the cleft between the small and large lobes of the CDKs and inhibit the binding of ATP. Like ATP, palbociclib forms hydrogen bonds with residues in the hinge segment of the cleft. Like the adenine base of ATP, palbociclib interacts with catalytic spine residues CS6 and CS7. CDK antagonists are in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of malignancies. Significantly, palbociclib has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative breast cancer in conjunction with letrozole as a first-line therapy and with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment. As inhibitors of the cell cycle, it is not surprising that one of their most common toxicities is myelosuppression with decreased neutrophil production. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is implicated in human breast carcinomas (BC).;SV40 presence was investigated by PCR assays targeting the Tag, the regulatory, and the VP1 regions in 109 invasive breast ductal carcinomas from Tunisian women. We also examined the relationship between the presence of SV40 and promoter methylation status of 15 tumor-related genes. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the expression of Tag, estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2, and P53.;SV40 DNA sequences were detected in 22% of tumors and in only 1.8% of the matched non-tumoral tissues. Using immunohistochemistry, SV40 was detected in the tumor cells. Hypermethylation frequencies were 78% for RASSF1A, 66% for SHP1, 61% for HIN1 and BRCA1, 47% for P16 and ER, 42% for CDH1 and APC, 40% for BLU, 35% for DAPK, 34% for RARbeta2, 27% for GSTP1, 17% for TIMP3, 14% for CCND2, and 8% for hMLH1. Interestingly, the frequencies of RASSF1A, SHP1, BRCA1, and TIMP3 methylation, and the mean of the methylation index (MI) were significantly higher in SV40-positive than in SV40-negative cases (P-values ranging from 0.043 to 0.003). Moreover, SV40 presence correlates with P53 protein accumulation (32.7% vs. 13.3%; P=0.015) and HER2 low expression (3.7% vs. 28%; P=0.008). We also found SV40 more frequently in patients over 50 years than in younger patients (34.8% vs. 12.3%; P=0.006).;This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of SV40 in human BC and provides data supporting a role for this virus in the pathogenesis of these tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 (MKK4) is a component of a stress and cytokine-induced signal transduction pathway involving MAPK proteins. The MKK4 protein has been implicated in activation of JNK1 and p38 MAPK on phosphorylation by conserved kinase pathways. A recent report on the deletion and mutation of the MKK4 gene in human pancreatic, lung, breast, testicle, and colorectal cancer cell lines suggests an additional role for MKK4 in tumor suppression. Both the gene function and the infrequency of mutations might be considered atypical for many human tumor suppressor genes, and constitutional DNA was not previously available to determine whether the reported sequence variants had preceded tumor development. Here, we report that homozygous deletions are detected in 2 of 92 pancreatic adenocarcinomas (2%), 1 of 16 biliary adenocarcinomas (6%), and 1 of 22 breast carcinomas (when combined with reported sequence alterations, 3 of 22 or 14%). In addition, in a panel of 45 pancreatic carcinomas prescreened for loss of heterozygosity, one somatic missense mutation of MKK4 is observed and confirmed in the primary tumor (2%). Mapping of the homozygous deletions further indicated MKK4 to lie at the target of deletion. The finding of a somatic missense mutation in the absence of any other nucleotide polymorphisms or silent nucleotide changes continues to favor MKK4 as a mutationally targeted tumor suppressor gene. Coexistent mutations of other tumor suppressor genes in MKK4-deficient tumors suggest that MKK4 may participate in a tumor suppressive signaling pathway distinct from DPC4, p16, p53, and BRCA2.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In the literature, sufficient attention has not been paid to the precise subcellular localization of immunohistochemical signals, the knowledge of which is essential for proper interpretation of immunostains and distinction of genuine staining from biotin-associated or other nonspecific stainings. The subcellular localization of the signals can in fact be easily deduced from the known biologic or ultrastructural characteristics of the antigens. Extracellular antigens obviously are located in the extracellular compartment. Cellular antigens fall into 3 major groups: membranous, nuclear, and cytoplasmic. Membranous antigens include cell adhesion molecules (such as E-cadherin, N-CAM), cell surface/transmembrane receptors and proteins (such as tyrosine kinase receptors, most leukocyte antigens, CD10, CEA), and molecules linking surface molecules to cytoskeleton (such as beta-catenin, dystrophin). Nuclear antigens include cell cycle-associated proteins (such as cyclins, p16, Ki-67), nuclear enzymes (such as TdT), transcription factors (such as TTF-1, CDX-2, myogenin, PAX-5), tumor suppressor gene products (such as p53, p63, WT1, Rb), steroid hormone receptors (such as ER, PR), calcium-binding proteins (such as S-100 protein, calretinin), and some viral proteins (such as CMV, herpes). Cytoplasmic antigens can take up a granular pattern due to localization in organelles, granules, or secretory vesicles (such as chromogranin, hormones, lysozyme, HMB-45), fibrillary pattern attributable to the filamentous nature of the molecules (intermediate filaments and microfilaments), or diffuse or patchy pattern due to localization in the cytosol or large vesicles (such as myoglobin, albumin, thyroglobulin). Aberrant localization of the molecules, when present, can provide important insight into disease processes and aid in their diagnosis, such as loss of membranous E-cadherin expression in lobular breast carcinoma, aberrant nuclear localization of beta-catenin in colorectal adenocarcinoma, pattern of ALK staining in anaplastic large cell lymphoma correlating with the different types of chromosomal translocations, presence of additional cytoplasmic CD10 staining in the enterocytes indicative of microvillous inclusion disease, and \"reversed\" staining for EMA in micropapillary mammary carcinoma.",
