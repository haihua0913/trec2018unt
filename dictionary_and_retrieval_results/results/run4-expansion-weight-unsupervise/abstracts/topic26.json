The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab is a backbone of most therapeutic regimens; however, biomarkers predicting its activity are not known. We report two cases of mCRC with a Q61K NRAS mutation that had a favorable response to bevacizumab and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid. In contrast, none of ten patients with wild-type NRAS or unknown NRAS status and mutated KRAS (NRAS and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive) responded to the same regimen. These results suggest that NRAS mutation merits further investigation as a potential biomarker predicting the efficacy of bevacizumab-based treatment.",

The aim of this study was to screen for mutations in these genes in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to explore their correlations with certain clinicopathological parameters. We tested mutations in the KRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4), NRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4), PIK3CA (exon 20) and BRAF (exon 15) genes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing in a large cohort of 1,110 Chinese CRC patients who underwent surgical resection at one of three major teaching hospitals located in different regions of China. The prevalence rates of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were 45.4%, 3.9%, 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively. Mutant KRAS was associated with the mucinous subtype and greater differentiation, while mutant BRAF was associated with right-sided tumors and poorer differentiation. Our results revealed differences in the genetic profiles of KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF at mutation hotspots between Chinese CRC patients and those of Western countries, while some of these gene features were shared among patients from other Asian countries.

To evaluate the suitability of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue for these treatment approaches and to find a possible link to pretherapeutic conditions of other targeted strategies, we compared neuroendocrine differentiation and KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA/TP53 mutational status in primary and metastatic CRC. Immunohistochemical expression analysis of neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin was performed on archival CRC tissue, comprising 116 primary tumors, 258 lymph node metastases and 72 distant metastases from 115 patients. All CRC samples but 30 distant metastases were subjected to mutation analysis of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and TP53. Neuroendocrine marker expression was found significantly less frequently in lymph node metastases compared to primary tumors and distant metastases (20%, 31%, 28%, respectively, P = 0.044). KRAS mutation rates increased significantly from primary tumors to lymph node metastases and distant metastases within the neuroendocrine negative CRC group (44%, 53%, 64%, respectively, P = 0.042). Neuroendocrine differentiation was significantly less concordant than KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA/TP53 mutational status in primary tumor/lymph node metastases pairs (65% versus 88%-99%; P < 0.0001) and primary tumor/distant metastases pairs (64% versus 83%-100%; P = 0.027 and P < 0.0001, respectively). According to these data, therapeutic targeting of neuroendocrine tumor cells can be considered only for a subset of CRC patients and biopsies from the metastatic site should be used to guide therapy. A possible importance of lacking neuroendocrine differentiation for progression of KRAS mutant CRC should be further investigated. ",

However, little is known about the role of the rarer NRAS mutations as a mechanism of primary resistance to the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab in wild-type KRAS mCRC. Using isogenic mCRC cells with a heterozygous knock-in of the NRAS activating mutation Q61K, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which mutant NRAS blocks cetuximab from inhibiting mCRC growth. NRASQ61K/+ cells were refractory to cetuximab-induced growth inhibition. Pathway-oriented proteome profiling revealed that cetuximab-unresponsive ERK1/2 phosphorylation was the sole biomarker distinguishing cetuximab-refractory NRASQ61K/+ from cetuximab-sensitive NRAS+/+ cells. We therefore employed four representative MEK1/2 inhibitors (binimetinib, trametinib, selumetinib, and pimasertib) to evaluate the therapeutic value of MEK/ERK signaling in cetuximab-refractory NRAS mutation-induced mCRC. Co-treatment with an ineffective dose of cetuximab augmented, up to more than 1,300-fold, the cytotoxic effects of pimasertib against NRASQ61K/+ cells. Simultaneous combination of MEK1/2 inhibitors with cetuximab resulted in extremely high and dose-dependent synthetic lethal effects, which were executed, at least in part, by exacerbated apoptotic cell death. Dynamic monitoring of real-time cell growth rates confirmed that cetuximab synergistically sensitized NRASQ61K/+ cellsto MEK1/2 inhibition. Our discovery of a synthetic lethal interaction of cetuximab in combination with MEK1/2 inhibition for the NRAS mutant subgroup of mCRC underscores the importance of therapeutic intervention both in the MEK-ERK and EGFR pathways to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy against NRAS-mutant mCRC tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent solid tumors in the Western world. Treatment options are dependent on the stage of the disease, the performance status of the patient, and increasingly the molecular makeup of the tumor. In countries with surveillance programs, the incidence rate as well as the mortality rate has gone down because of the earlier stages at which the tumors are detected. For rectal cancer, standard of care differs from that of colon cancer with regard to perioperative treatment. In the metastatic setting, treatment options are uniform for colorectal cancer. Over the years, treatment options have emerged from single-agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment to combination regimens using 5-FU and oxaliplatin or irinotecan or both. Treatment efficacy in the metastatic setting has been increased with the introduction of targeted substances. These include (a) the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-A (anti-VEGF-A) antibody bevacizumab, (b) the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, (c) the anti-angiogenic multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib, and (d) the anti-angiogenic compound aflibercept. Anti-EGFR antibodies have shown efficacy only in the subpopulations of tumors that do not have any mutation in KRAS and NRAS exon 2, 3, 4. Physicians have the choice in the first line to use anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy based on treatment goals and patient performance. In recent years, tumor location has been shown to be prognostic and predictive for clinical outcome. Right-sided sporadic colon cancers differ significantly in molecular characteristics and, with the exception of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) tumors, are associated with poor prognosis. Tumors based on hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, on the other hand, have excellent prognosis in stage II and III disease. Recent efforts have focused on the molecular classification of colorectal cancer with the purpose of establishing molecularly defined subgroups. ",

Since then, there have been over 11,000 mutations in the three RAS (HRAS, KRAS and NRAS) genes in codons 12, 13 and 61 reported in the literature. We report here the identification of recurrent somatic missense mutations at alanine 146, a highly conserved residue in the guanine nucleotide binding domain. In two independent series of colorectal cancers from Hong Kong and the United States we detected KRAS A146 mutations in 7/126 and 2/94 cases, respectively, giving a combined frequency of 4%. We also detected KRAS A146 mutations in 2/40 (5%) colorectal cell lines, including the NCI-60 colorectal cancer line HCC2998. Codon 146 mutations thus are likely to make an equal or greater contribution to colorectal cancer than codon 61 mutations (4.2% in our combined series, 1% in the literature). Lung adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas did not show codon 146 mutations. We did, however, identify a KRAS A146 mutation in the ML-2 acute myeloid leukemia cell line and an NRAS A146 mutation in the NALM-6 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line, suggesting that the contribution of codon 146 mutations is not entirely restricted to colorectal cancers or to KRAS.",

Other genomic and protein expression alterations have recently been identified as potential targets of treatment or as markers of chemotherapy or targeted-therapy resistance, including ERCC1 expression, c-Met expression, PTEN expression, HER2 amplification, HER3 expression, and rare KRAS mutations. As the number of distinct validated intratumor genomic assays increases, numerous molecular assays will need to be compiled into one multigene panel assay.

Tumor cellularity and mutant allele frequency were analyzed to identify tumor heterogeneity and mutant allele-specific imbalance. Next-generation sequencing showed precise measurement of mutant allele frequencies and detected 23% of mutations with 2-20% mutant allele frequencies. Of the KRAS mutations detected, 17% were outside of codons 12 and 13. Among PIK3CA mutations, 48% were outside of codons 542, 545, and 1047. The percentage of tumors with predicted resistance to anti-EGFR therapy increased from 40% when testing for only mutations in KRAS exon 2 to 47% when testing for KRAS exons 2-4, 48% when testing for KRAS and NRAS exons 2-4, 58% when including BRAF codon 600 mutations, and 59% when adding PIK3CA exon 20 mutations. Right-sided colorectal cancers carried a higher risk of predicted anti-EGFR resistance. A concomitant KRAS mutation was detected in 51% of PIK3CA, 23% of NRAS, and 33% of kinase-impaired BRAF-mutated tumors. Lower than expected mutant allele frequency indicated tumor heterogeneity, while higher than expected mutant allele frequency indicated mutant allele-specific imbalance. Two paired neuroendocrine carcinomas and adjacent adenomas showed identical KRAS mutations, but only PIK3CA mutations in neuroendocrine carcinomas. Next-generation sequencing is a robust tool for mutation detection in clinical laboratories.

Results were validated using independent The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets.

Treatment of CRC cell lines with hypomethylating agents decreased methylation and increased expression of EREG. Inferior PFS with anti-EGFR therapy was associated with CIMP-high status, BRAF mutation, NRAS mutation, and right-sided primary tumour on univariate analysis. Among known BRAF/NRAS wild-type tumours, inferior PFS remained associated with CIMP-high status (median PFS 5.6 vs 9.0 mo, P=0.023).;EREG and AREG are strongly regulated by methylation, and their expression is associated with CIMP status and primary tumour site, which may explain the association of primary tumour site and EREG/AREG expression with anti-EGFR therapy efficacy.",

Two investigators independently evaluated and extracted data from each identified studies based on selected criteria of inclusion and exclusion.;The introduction of agents targeting EGFR such as cetuximab and panitumumab increased overall survival of mCRCs. Nevertheless, it has firstly became evident that response rates to cetuximab regimens in unselected patient populations were typically lower than 30%. Clinical data confirmed the predictive value of RAS mutations for resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab leading to the license of these monoclonal antibodies exclusively for the management of patients with RAS-wild type colorectal cancers. So far the identification of predictive biomarkers have generated interesting, though preliminary and, at times, conflicting data on the importance of tumour mRNA levels of EGFR ligands, of activating mutations in other genes such as NRAS and PIK3CA. The prognostic value of selected microRNAs level and ADCC activity is under investigation, while the prognostic impact of BRAF status remains controversial.;This review focuses on the personalized treatment of mCRC and discusses the potential of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers in selecting patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy.",

The morphological steps in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence have been elucidated at a molecular level, which has been facilitated by identification of the genes responsible for familial intestinal cancer. However, apart from early detection of familial forms of CRC and its use in genetic counseling, until recently such detailed molecular knowledge has had little impact on clinical management of the disease. This has dramatically changed in the last decade. With drugs specifically targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) having been shown effective in CRC, mechanisms responsible for resistance have been explored. The finding that KRAS mutated cancers do not respond to anti-EGFR treatment has had a profound impact on clinical management and on molecular diagnostics of CRC. Additional genetic tests for mutations in NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA contribute to determining who to treat, and others will follow. New therapies effective in patients with advanced CRC are under investigation. Remaining burning questions for optimal management are which patients will relapse after resection of the primary tumor and which patients will respond to the standard 5FU-oxaliplatin adjuvant treatment regimen. Predictive tests to address these issues are eagerly awaited. New classifications of CRC, based on molecular parameters, are emerging, and we will be confronted with new subtypes of CRC, for which the definition is based on combinations of gene expression patterns, chromosomal alterations, gene mutations and epigenetic characteristics. This will be instrumental in designing new approaches for therapy but will also be translated into molecular diagnostics. Both will contribute to improved clinical management of CRC. ",

We determined the association of extended RAS and mismatch repair (MMR) status with the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy.

In contrast, among patients without RAS mutations, there was no difference in RFS or overall survival between the adjuvant UFT group and surgery-alone group. We detected deficient DNA MMR in 23/304 (8%) patients. The MMR status was neither prognostic nor predictive for adjuvant chemotherapy. An interaction analysis showed that there was better RFS among patients treated with UFT with RAS mutations, but not for those without RAS mutations.

        "Doc_abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In recent years, therapeutic advances have prolonged the survival of patients with advanced disease. Along with the addition of new treatments, an increasing body of literature explores the potential benefit of using molecular testing to define tumor, circulating, or host biomarkers of benefit to specific treatment strategies. At present, testing for specific mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 of KRAS and NRAS has become accepted practice to select patients for treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agents. Additionally, testing for the BRAF V600E mutation is used to refine decisions based on patient prognosis. The presence of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) *28 polymorphism is associated with toxicity from irinotecan, although it has not been universally applied. Nonetheless, molecular markers to predict response and toxicity of cytotoxic therapy are evolving. While the development of selection biomarkers for anti-angiogenic treatments has not proved fruitful to date, improved development strategies and novel targeted agents are anticipated to revolutionize the approach to treatment of advanced CRC in the near future. This review summarizes currently available data to select treatment strategies in patients with advanced CRC. ",

Anti-EGFR antibodies bind competitively to EGFRs to inhibit receptor activation and subsequent signal transduction of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway and PI3K/AKT pathway. By inhibiting EGFR-mediated signal transduction, anti-EGFR antibodies inhibit cell growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, and they induce apoptosis. The IgG1-type antibody cetuximab is also capable of inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Several studies have shown that KRAS mutation is a useful biomarker for predicting the efficacy of anti-EGFR agents, and the major guidelines for the treatment of CRC recommend the use of anti-EGFR antibody only for the cancers with wild-type KRAS. Alterations of other genes, including BRAF, NRAS, PTEN and AKT, and EGFR expression/gene copy number have also been reported to be candidate biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of anti-EGFR agents.

We systematically reviewed the benefits and harms of EGFR-related pharmacogenetic testing of molecular targets downstream to KRAS in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. We searched five electronic databases from January 2000 through November 2010, and conducted separate grey literature and conference abstracts searches. Two reviewers independently assessed all articles for relevance and quality. We identified 27 studies, primarily fair- to marginal-quality, small retrospective, and single-arm cohort studies with significant overlap in patient populations. We identified seven studies that studied BRAF in independent patient populations, one that studied NRAS, four that studied PIK3CA, eight that studied PTEN expression, and five that studied AKT expression. The best evidence for BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA comes from the largest retrospective study (n=649) of chemorefractory patients from seven European countries. In this study, BRAF mutation was present in 6.5% of KRAS wild-type tumors. Only 8.3% of persons with BRAF mutations, compared to 38% of persons without BRAF mutations (p=0.0012), responded to chemotherapy with cetuximab. Clinical sensitivity and the false positive fraction (1- specificity) were estimated at 9.8% (95% CI 6.3, 14.5) and 1.6% (95% CI 0.2, 5.6), respectively. BRAF mutation was also associated with worse median progression-free survival (absolute difference 18 weeks, p<0.0001), and overall survival (absolute difference 28 weeks, p<0.0001). In the only study comparing outcomes in persons who did (n=227) and did not (n=332) receive cetuximab with combination chemotherapy, those with BRAF mutation had worse survival outcomes regardless of whether or not they received cetuximab. Although NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were also associated with worse outcomes compared to persons without these mutations, evidence is based on a small number of identified mutations. Evidence for protein expression of PTEN and AKT is more sparse and limited by variable methods for assessing protein expression. Low-quality evidence addressing clinical validity of pharmacogenetic testing in metastatic colorectal cancer patients suggests that BRAF mutations are associated with poorer treatment response and survival outcomes, although this association may be independent of treatment with EGFR inhibitors.",

Beyond standard diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, such as those used for Lynch syndrome, mutations in KRAS exon 2 are well established as predictive for lack of response to the antiepidermal growth factor receptor therapies panitumumab and cetuximab. Recent studies have extended these findings by demonstrating that mutations in KRAS exons 3 and 4 and in NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 (with all KRAS and NRAS mutations collectively referred to as RAS) are also predictive for treatment outcomes among patients with mCRC receiving panitumumab and cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy or as monotherapy. Consequently, evaluation of these additional loci has been incorporated into current clinical guidelines, and pathologists will need to develop testing procedures and algorithms to reliably and rapidly evaluate RAS status. With the increased number of mutations that must be examined to evaluate the status of RAS and other emerging biomarkers, next-generation sequencing technologies are likely to become increasingly important in mCRC testing.

We have developed a single, next-generation sequencing assay to simultaneously evaluate colorectal cancers for mutations in relevant cancer genes (KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF) and for tumor microsatellite instability (MSI). In a sample set of 61 cases, the assay demonstrated overall sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% for identifying cancer-associated mutations, with a practical limit of detection at 2% mutant allele fraction. MSIplus was 97% sensitive (34 of 35 MSI-positive cases) and 100% specific (42 of 42 MSI-negative cases) for ascertaining MSI phenotype in a cohort of 78 tumor specimens. These performance characteristics were slightly better than for conventional multiplex PCR MSI testing (97% sensitivity and 95% specificity), which is based on comparison of microsatellite loci amplified from tumor and matched normal material, applied to the same specimen cohort. Because the assay uses an amplicon sequencing approach, it is rapid and appropriate for specimens with limited available material or fragmented DNA. This integrated testing strategy offers several advantages over existing methods, including a lack of need for matched normal material, sensitive and unbiased detection of variants in target genes, and an automated analysis pipeline enabling principled and reproducible identification of cancer-associated mutations and MSI status simultaneously.

        "Doc_abstract":"Our understanding of the genetic and nongenetic molecular alterations associated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) has markedly expanded in recent years. Mutations in RAS genes (KRAS/NRAS exons 2, 3, or 4) predict a lack of clinical benefit when anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are added to chemotherapy. Genetic events in additional nodes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways that bypass EGFR signaling, such as BRAF or PIK3CA mutations or KRAS, ERBB2, or MET amplifications, also may confer resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab. Polymorphisms that block antibody binding as a result of EGFR extracellular domain mutations have been reported. Nongenetic mechanisms, including compensatory activation of receptor tyrosine kinases HER3 and MET, together with high expression of the ligands amphiregulin, transforming growth factor alpha heregulin, and hepatocyte growth factor in the tumor microenvironment also are thought to be involved in resistance. In one-third of the samples, more than one genetic event can be found, and nongenetic events most likely coexist with gene alterations. Furthermore, activation of a gene expression signature of epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been associated with reduced cellular dependence on EGFR signaling. Collectively, this body of work provides convincing evidence that the molecular heterogeneity of CRC plays an important role in the context of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Herein, we discuss how this knowledge has been translated into drug development strategies to overcome primary and acquired anti-EGFR resistance, with rational combinations of targeted agents in genomically selected populations, second-generation EGFR inhibitors, and other agents expected to boost the immune response at the tumor site.

To fully realize its potential, high-throughput sequencing platforms that allow genotyping beyond KRAS need to be implemented and require performance assessment. We comprehensively analyzed first-year data of 202 consecutive formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) CRC samples for which prospective genotyping at our institution was requested. Deep targeted genotyping was done using a semiconductor-based sequencing platform and a self-designed panel of 30 CRC-related genes. Additionally, microsatellite status (MS) was determined. Ninety-seven percent of tumor samples were suitable for sequencing and in 88% MS could be assessed. The minimal drop-out rates of 6 and 25 cases, respectively were due to too low amounts or heavy degradation of DNA. Of 557 nonsynonymous mutations, 90 (16%) have not been described in COSMIC at the time of data query. Forty-three cases (22%) had double- or triple mutations affecting a single gene. Sixty-four percent had genetic alterations influencing oncological therapy. Eight percent of patients (MSI phenotype: 6%; mutated POLE: 2%) were potentially eligible for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Of 56% of KRASwt CRC that potentially qualified for anti-EGFR treatment, 30% presented with mutations in BRAF/NRAS. Mutated PIK3CA was detected in 21%. In conclusion, we here present real-life routine diagnostics data that not only demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of deep targeted sequencing and MS-analysis of FFPE CRC samples but also contribute to the understanding of CRC genetics. Most importantly, in more than half of the patients our approach enabled the selection of the best treatment currently available. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ",

The Idyllaâ„¢ KRAS Mutation Test on the molecular diagnostics Idyllaâ„¢ platform is a simple (<2 minutes hands-on time), highly reliable, and rapid (approximately 2 hours turnaround time) in vitro diagnostic sample-to-result solution. This test enables qualitative detection of 21 mutations in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, and 146 of the KRAS oncogene being clinically relevant according to the latest clinical guidelines. Here, the performance of the Idyllaâ„¢ KRAS Mutation Assay, for Research Use Only, was assessed on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections by comparing its results with the results previously obtained by routine reference approaches for KRAS genotyping. In case of discordance, samples were assessed further by additional methods. Among the 374 colorectal cancer FFPE samples tested, the overall concordance between the Idyllaâ„¢ KRAS Mutation Assay and the confirmed reference routine test results was found to be 98.9%. The Idyllaâ„¢ KRAS Mutation Assay enabled detection of 5 additional KRAS-mutated samples not detected previously with reference methods. As conclusion the Idyllaâ„¢ KRAS Mutation Test can be applied as routine tool in any clinical setting, without needing molecular infrastructure or expertise, to guide the personalized treatment of colorectal cancer patients.",

Here, we modeled disease progression using EGFR-mutant human tumor cell lines. Although five of six models displayed alterations already found in humans, one harbored an unexpected secondary NRAS Q61K mutation; resistant cells were sensitive to concurrent EGFR and MEK inhibition but to neither alone. Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer mortality in Western countries, mostly due to metastasis. Understanding the natural history and prognostic factors in patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) is essential for the optimal design of clinical trials. The main prognostic factors currently used in clinical practice are related to tumor behavior (e.g., white blood counts, levels of lactate dehydrogenase, levels of alkaline phosphatase) disease extension (e.g., presence of extrahepatic spread, number of organs affected) and general functional status (e.g., performance status as defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group). However, these parameters are not always sufficient to establish appropriate therapeutic strategies. First-line therapy in mCRC combines conventional chemotherapy (CHT) (e.g., FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, CAPOX) with a number of agents targeted to specific signaling pathways (TA) (e.g., panitumumab and cetuximab for cases KRAS/NRAS WT, and bevacizumab). Although the response rate to this combination regime exceeds 50%, progression of the disease is almost universal and only less than 10% of patients are free of disease at 2 years. Current clinical trials with second and third line therapy include new TA, such as tyrosin-kinase receptors inhibitors (MET, HER2, IGF-1R), inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, PI3K, AKT, mTORC, NOTCH and JAK1/JAK2, immunotherapy modulators and check point inhibitors (anti-PD-L1 and anti- PD1). Despite the identification of multiple prognostic and predictive biomarkers and signatures, it is still unclear how expression of many of these biomarkers is modulated by CHT and/or TA, thus potentially affecting response to treatment. In this review we analyzed how certain biomarkers in tumor cells and microenvironment influence the response to new TA and immune-therapies strategies in mCRC pre-treated patients. ",

Initial data suggested EGFR-targeted mAb treatment should be limited to patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type (WT) tumours, but the availability of tumour samples from large phase III studies permitted evaluation of additional potential biomarkers of activity for these agents. Subsequent analyses further refined the target population to those patients whose tumours were WT for KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4 (i.e., those with RAS WT status). Here, we review key clinical data for panitumumab in mCRC across the lines of treatment, assessing in detail the impact of more comprehensive RAS selection on patient outcomes.

The intention here is to provide a synopsis of current progress in this developing area by reviewing existing publications and ongoing clinical trials. While bevacizumab plus anti-EGFR agents exhibit detrimental effects in first-line setting , a combination of bevacizumab with erlotinib has been suggested as an effective maintenance therapy. Dabrafenib plus panitumumab in combination with trametinib and encorafenib plus cetuximab in combination with alpelisib, are very promising combination treatments and are currently being developed in clinical trials for patients with BRAF mutant-type tumors. An earlier nonclinical trial suggested that a combination of panitumumab plus trametinib was effective in patients who were resistant to anti- EGFR agents but developing KRAS- or NRAS-mutated tumors. The HERACLES trial further indicated that a combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib showed promising antitumor effects in patients with emerging HER2 amplification. Other reports suggest that irinotecan and cetuximab in combination with tivantinib were more effective than a combination of irinotecan and cetuximab alone for patients with MET amplification, although further research is needed for this application, as results were based upon the analysis of subgroups. It is clear that data arising from both primary research and clinical trials support the combined use of molecular-targeted drugs in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. As clinical trials progress, it is likely that such treatment combinations will become recognized as standard therapies. ",

RAS mutant mCRC exhibited a significantly higher cumulative incidence of lung, bone, and brain metastasis and on multivariate analysis was an independent predictor of involvement of these sites (HR, 1.5, 1.6, and 3.7, respectively). PIK3CA mutations occurred in 10% of the 786 cases genotyped, did not predict for worse survival, and did not exhibit a site-specific pattern of metastatic spread.;The metastatic potential of CRC varies with the presence of RAS mutation. RAS mutation is associated with worse OS and increased incidence of lung, bone, and brain metastasis. An understanding of this site-specific pattern of spread may help to inform physicians' assessment of symptoms in patients with mCRC.",

It is recommended that both NRAS and KRAS mutation testing to be performed before a CRC is considered RAS wild-type. Given that mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been shown to be sensitive and specific for the detection of NRAS mutations in melanoma, we assessed the specificity of NRAS mutation-specific IHC in CRC. IHC was performed on tissue microarrays containing 2823 consecutive CRC undergoing surgery with curative intent using a novel mutation-specific antibody to the protein produced by the NRAS mutation (clone SP174). Tissue microarrays were assessed by 2 observers and all IHC-positive or equivocal cases were repeated on whole sections to confirm the result. Positive cases then underwent molecular testing by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight polymerase chain reaction. In total, 22 of 2823 (0.8%) CRCs demonstrated confirmed positive staining with complete interobserver concordance. RAS mutations were confirmed in all IHC-positive CRCs. In total, 11 cases harbored the NRASQ61R mutation. Surprisingly, 11 cases demonstrated the KRASQ61R mutation. We conclude that mutation-specific IHC with this currently available NRASQ61R antibody is highly specific for the presence of either NRASQ61R or KRASQ61R mutations in CRC. We caution that we did not assess the sensitivity of IHC and that this antibody does not detect other RAS mutations. Therefore, negative staining does not exclude a clinically significant RAS mutation. However, positive staining confirms the presence of an NRASQ61R or KRASQ61R mutation without the need for further molecular testing.",

Sequenom analysis and Sanger sequencing were used to evaluate mutations in K/NRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and TP53.;BRAF mutation was associated with early recurrence and death, whereas no impact of TP53 or PIK3CA mutation was identified. Although K/NRAS mutation was associated with worse survival in this cohort, this difference was no longer evident when those who had received anti-EGFR therapy were excluded. When stratifying patients according to the exon on which K/NRAS was mutated, there were dramatic differences in both survival and pathologic features. Exon 4 mutations were associated with large, solitary metastases occurring at long disease-free intervals compared with exon 3 mutations, which presented with small, numerous lesions. Patients who had exon 4 mutations recurred infrequently and had significantly longer survival compared with those who had wild type or other mutations.;By using this model of curative-intent, margin-negative resection in patients at high risk of recurrence, the authors were able to establish a link between mutation location within the K/NRAS gene and the biology of metastatic colorectal cancer.

Alterations of BRAF/NRAS/ PIK3CA/PTEN, have independently been found to give rise to resistance. The first-line trials with cetuximab chemotherapy are conflicting, because of the many differences among prospective and retrospective evaluations. In neoadjuvant regimens, cetuximab with CT obtained a significant and early increase of the RR. In second-line studies cetuximab improved RR and PFS. In third-line studies cetuximab-irinotecan is associated with a significant advantage in ORR, mTTP and OS. Cetuximab has not reported any benefit neither in adjuvant nor in trials with bevacizumab. In third-line studies cetuximab-irinotecan is associated with a significant advantage in ORR, mTTP and OS.

The monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab, directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), undoubtedly represent a major step forward in the treatment of mCRC, given the relevant efficacy in terms of progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and quality of life observed in several phase III clinical trials among different lines of treatment. However, the anti-EGFR moAbs were shown only to be effective in a subset of patients. For instance, KRAS and NRAS mutations have been identified as biomarkers of resistance to these drugs, improving the selection of patients who might derive a benefit from these treatments. Nevertheless, several other alterations might affect the response to these drugs, and unfortunately, even the responders eventually become resistant by developing secondary (or acquired) resistance in approximately 13-18 mo. Several studies highlighted that the landscape of responsible alterations of both primary and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR drugs biochemically converge into MEK-ERK and PIK3CA-AKT pathways. In this review, we describe the currently known mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR moAbs together with the various strategies evaluated to prevent, overcame or revert them. ",

Thus, testing for the 7 most common mutations of KRAS codons 12 and 13 is now recommended as a clinical practice. However, pooled analysis of randomized controlled studies in Western countries in patients treated with cetuximab has suggested that patients with tumors showing the KRAS p. G13D mutation[a glycine(G)to aspartate(D)transition mutation] have longer overall survival and progression-free survival when compared to patients with other KRAS mutations. Furthermore, even among patients whose tumors are wild-type for KRAS codons 12 and 13, response rates are only 13~17% for anti-EGFR antibody monotherapy. These facts suggest that additional activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MAPK or PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways may also confer resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapies. Indeed, recent retrospective studies have shown that mutations in KRAS codon 61 and 146, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA may also predict resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies in colorectal cancer patients.

Specifically, the HER3 receptor is capable of heterodimerizing with multiple EGFR family members resulting in downstream activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways. Monoclonal antibodies targeted against the HER3 receptor are being investigated in clinical trials; however, preliminary data has shown limited clinical activity. Thus, given the relevance of the HER3 receptor in activating downstream effector pathways and in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, the therapeutic targeting of HER3 in combination with primary drivers of the tumor is also being investigated. Here, we review the role of HER3 as a promoter of clinical resistance to EGFR therapy and discuss therapeutic approaches that could potentially overcome this resistance. ",

We designed our study to analyze changes in NRAS mutant tumor cells derived from malignancies other than melanoma. A variety of small molecule inhibitors as well as their combinations was tested in order to find beneficial inhibitory modalities in NRASQ61mutant lung cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines. Signaling changes after incubation with inhibitors were studied and compared to those found in NRAS mutant melanoma. All cell lines were most sensitive to inhibition in the MAPK pathway with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. MEK/AKT and MEK/CDK4,6 inhibitor combinations did not show any beneficial effects in vitro. However, we observed strong synergism combining MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in all cell lines. Our study provides evidence that NRAS mutant cancers share signaling similarities across different malignancies. We demonstrate that dual pathway inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway synergistically reduces cell viability in NRAS mutant cancers regardless of their tissue origin. Our results suggest that such inhibitor combinations may be a potential treatment option for non-melanoma tumors harboring activating NRAS mutations. ",

The choice of fluoropyrimidine therapy (capecitabine or infused fluouroracil plus leucovorin) was decided before randomisation. Randomisation was done centrally (via telephone) by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit using minimisation. Treatment allocation was not masked. The comparison of arms A and C is described in a companion paper. Here, we present the comparison of arm A and B, for which the primary outcome was overall survival in patients with KRAS wild-type tumours. Analysis was by intention to treat. Further analyses with respect to NRAS, BRAF, and EGFR status were done. The trial is registered, ISRCTN27286448.;1630 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (815 to standard therapy and 815 to addition of cetuximab). Tumour samples from 1316 (81%) patients were used for somatic molecular analyses; 565 (43%) had KRAS mutations. In patients with KRAS wild-type tumours (arm A, n=367; arm B, n=362), overall survival did not differ between treatment groups (median survival 17Â·9 months [IQR 10Â·3-29Â·2] in the control group vs 17Â·0 months [9Â·4-30Â·1] in the cetuximab group; HR 1Â·04, 95% CI 0Â·87-1Â·23, p=0Â·67). Similarly, there was no effect on progression-free survival (8Â·6 months [IQR 5Â·0-12Â·5] in the control group vs 8Â·6 months [5Â·1-13Â·8] in the cetuximab group; HR 0Â·96, 0Â·82-1Â·12, p=0Â·60). Overall response rate increased from 57% (n=209) with chemotherapy alone to 64% (n=232) with addition of cetuximab (p=0Â·049). Grade 3 and higher skin and gastrointestinal toxic effects were increased with cetuximab (14 vs 114 and 67 vs 97 patients in the control group vs the cetuximab group with KRAS wild-type tumours, respectively). Overall survival differs by somatic mutation status irrespective of treatment received: BRAF mutant, 8Â·8 months (IQR 4Â·5-27Â·4); KRAS mutant, 14Â·4 months (8Â·5-24Â·0); all wild-type, 20Â·1 months (11Â·5-31Â·7).;This trial has not confirmed a benefit of addition of cetuximab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Cetuximab increases response rate, with no evidence of benefit in progression-free or overall survival in KRAS wild-type patients or even in patients selected by additional mutational analysis of their tumours.

For 60 of these samples mutation status of APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, FBXW7, SMAD4, BRAF and NRAS was determined using targeted massive parallel sequencing. Loss of chromosome 18q12.1-18q12.2 occurred more frequently in tumors that relapsed than in relapse-free tumors (p < 0.001; FDR = 0.13). In total, 267 genes were recurrently affected by SVs (FDR < 0.1). CNAs and SVs were not associated with disease-free survival (DFS). Mutations in APC and TP53 were associated with increased CNAs.

By contrast, the addition of anti-EGFR therapy to the treatment regime of resistant patients may lead to worse progression-free survival and overall survival. Therefore, identifying sensitive and resistant patients prior to targeted therapy of metastatic colorecal cancer is a key point during the initial decision making process. Previous research shows that primary resistance to EGFR blockade is in most cases caused by constitutive activation of signaling pathways downstream of EGFR. Of all relevant factors (mutation of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressors PTEN and TP53, amplification of EGFR and HER2, and expression of epiregulin and amphiregulin, mikroRNA miR-31-3p, and miR-31-5p), only evaluation of KRAS and NRAS mutations has entered routine clinical practice. The role of the other markers still needs to be validated. The ongoing benefit of anti-EGFR therapy could be indicated by specific clinical parameters measured after the initiation of targeted therapy, including early tumor shrinkage, the deepness of the response, or hypomagnesemia. The accuracy of predictive dia-gnostic tools could be also increased by examining a combination of predictive markers using next generation sequencing methods. However, unjustified investigation of many molecular markers should be resisted as this may complicate interpretation of the results, particularly in terms of their specific clinical relevance.;The aim of this review is to describe current possibilities with respect to predicting responses to EGFR blockade in the context of the EGFR pathway, and the utilization of such results in routine clinical practice.",

Each xenograft was expanded into four treatment arms: placebo, the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235, or AZD6244 + BEZ235. Cases initially treated with placebo crossed over to AZD6244, BEZ235, and the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab.;At the 3-week evaluation time point, cotreatment of established tumors with AZD6244 + BEZ235 induced disease stabilization in the majority of cases (70%) but did not lead to overt tumor regression.

We designed a pyrosequencing assay to detect mutations in all three positions of codons 542 and 545 in exon 9 and codon 1047 in exon 20 of this gene. The exon 9 reverse PCR primer was designed to avoid amplifying a pseudogene in chromosome 22 that has >95% homology with exons 9 through 13 in PIK3CA. Two hundred colorectal cancers from FFPE tissue previously characterized for KRAS mutation status were evaluated for PIK3CA mutations. In KRAS-mutated samples, 20% had an additional mutation in PIK3CA. The mutation rate in KRAS wild-type samples was 7.5%. When using our assay, pseudogene was not observed in any of these samples. In addition, pseudogene- and gene-specific amplification was performed on DNA from 40 additional colorectal cancers. Sequencing of these PCR products yielded the expected gene or pseudogene sequence in all cases. Thus, we have developed a PIK3CA pyrosequencing assay capable of detecting mutations in all three positions in the three hot spot codons with no pseudogene interference.",

We report here efficacy results for the FIRE-3 final RAS (KRAS/NRAS, exons 2-4) wild-type subgroup. Moreover, new metrics of tumour dynamics were explored during a centralised radiological review to investigate how FOLFIRI plus cetuximab conferred overall survival benefit in the absence of differences in investigator-assessed objective responses and progression-free survival.;FIRE-3 was a randomised phase 3 trial comparing FOLFIRI plus cetuximab with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary endpoint of the FIRE-3 study was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 in the intention-to-treat population. A centralised radiological review of CT scans was done in a post-hoc analysis to assess objective response according to RECIST 1.1, early tumour shrinkage, depth of response, duration of response, and time to response in the final RAS wild-type subgroup. Comparisons between treatment groups with respect to objective response rate and early tumour shrinkage were made using Fisher's exact test (two-sided), while differences in depth of response were investigated with a two-sided Wilcoxon test. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00433927.;In the final RAS wild-type population (n=400), median overall survival was better in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab group than the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group (33Â·1 months [95% CI 24Â·5-39Â·4] vs 25Â·0 months [23Â·0-28Â·1]; hazard ratio 0Â·70 [0Â·54-0Â·90]; p=0Â·0059), although investigator-assessed objective response and progression-free survival were comparable between treatment groups.

The level of certainty of the evidence was deemed high, and the magnitude of net health benefit from avoiding potentially ineffective and harmful treatment, along with promoting more immediate access to what could be the next most effective treatment, is at least moderate.The EWG found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against BRAF V600E testing for the same clinical scenario. The level of certainty for BRAF V600E testing to guide antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy was deemed low. The EWG encourages further studies of the potential value of testing in patients with mCRC who were found to have tumors that are wild type (mutation negative) for KRAS to predict responsiveness to therapy.The EWG found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against testing for mutations in NRAS, or PIK3CA, and/or loss of expression of PTEN or AKT proteins. The level of certainty for this evidence was low. In the absence of supporting evidence, and with consideration of other contextual issues, the EWG discourages the use of these tests in guiding decisions on initiating anti-EGFR therapy with cetuximab or panitumumab unless further evidence supports improved clinical outcomes.;It has been suggested that patients with mCRC whose tumors harbor certain mutations affecting EGFR pathway signaling are typically unresponsive to therapy with anti-EGFR antibodies (cetuximab and panitumumab). The EWG identified recent evidence reviews that have addressed this topic, and this recommendation statement is based on results of these reviews. In developing these recommendations the EWG considered evidence in the areas described below.;Although no research syntheses that have formally evaluated analytic validity of these tests were found, the EWG was able to draw the following conclusions from assessments included in the evidence reviews under consideration. There is adequate evidence that KRAS mutation analysis reliably and accurately detects common mutations (codons 12 and 13), whereas evidence was inadequate for less frequent KRAS mutations (e.g., codon 61). There is also adequate evidence that testing for BRAF V600E accurately and reliably detects the mutation. For common mutations in NRAS, PIK3CA, and expression of PTEN AKT, there is adequate evidence of accurate and reliable detection. However, much less data exist in support. Furthermore, in the specific context of mCRC, no evidence was found on the analytic validity of immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays for PTEN or AKT expression.;For KRAS mutation analysis, the EWG found convincing evidence for association with treatment response to anti-EGFR therapy, independent of prognostic association. For BRAF V600E mutation testing, the EWG found insufficient evidence for association with treatment response to anti-EGFR therapy independent of prognostic association. The EWG found insufficient evidence for association of results of testing for mutations in NRAS or PIK3CA, and loss of expression of PTEN or ATK proteins, with treatment response to anti-EGFR therapy.;For KRAS mutation analysis, the EWG found adequate evidence that improved health outcomes are achieved by avoiding ineffective chemotherapy and potential side effects and expediting access to the next most effective treatment. Inadequate evidence was found regarding association of BRAF V600E mutation testing or loss of PTEN expression with improved health outcomes among patients with mCRC undergoing anti-EGFR therapy as compared with patients with tumors bearing wild-type BRAF sequence and PTEN expression levels, respectively. No evidence was found to support improved health outcomes associated with testing results for NRAS or PIK3CA variants, or AKT protein expression levels in this clinical scenario.;CRC is an important and highly prevalent health problem. Improvements in mCRC outcomes associated with pharmacogenetic testing could have important clinical, and potentially public health, impacts. Adverse events related to cancer chemotherapy can be common and severe. Therefore, successfully optimizing treatment to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects is important for reducing mCRC-related morbidity and mortality."},

N-Ras(G12D) did not alter the growth properties of the epithelium, but was able to confer resistance to apoptosis. In the context of an Apc-mutant colonic tumor, activation of K-Ras led to defects in terminal differentiation and expansion of putative stem cells within the tumor epithelium. This K-Ras tumor phenotype was associated with attenuated signaling through the MAPK pathway, and human colon cancer cells expressing mutant K-Ras were hypersensitive to inhibition of Raf, but not Mek.

We suggest a new approach to trial design that links novel treatment evaluation with the concurrent evaluation of a biomarker within a confirmatory phase II/III trial setting. We describe a new protocol using this approach in advanced colorectal cancer called FOCUS4. The protocol will ultimately answer three research questions for a number of treatments and biomarkers: (1) After a period of first-line chemotherapy, do targeted novel therapies provide signals of activity in different biomarker-defined populations? (2) If so, do these definitively improve outcomes? (3) Is evidence of activity restricted to the biomarker-defined groups? The protocol randomizes novel agents against placebo concurrently across a number of different biomarker-defined population-enriched cohorts: BRAF mutation; activated AKT pathway: PI3K mutation/absolute PTEN loss tumors; KRAS and NRAS mutations; and wild type at all the mentioned genes. Within each biomarker-defined population, the trial uses a multistaged approach with flexibility to adapt in response to planned interim analyses for lack of activity. FOCUS4 is the first test of a protocol that assigns all patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to one of a number of parallel population-enriched, biomarker-stratified randomized trials. Using this approach allows questions regarding efficacy and safety of multiple novel therapies to be answered in a relatively quick and efficient manner, while also allowing for the assessment of biomarkers to help target treatment.

The cohort included 84 patients in whom tumor tissue from both primary and metastatic sites was available and 31 patients with pairs of metastases. Tumors were analyzed for mutations in the KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and TP53 genes, with discordant results between paired samples further investigated by analyzing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and/or by 454 sequencing. Copy number aberrations in primary tumors and matched metastases were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).;TP53 mutations were more frequent in metastatic versus primary tumors (53.1% v 30.3%, respectively; P < .001), whereas BRAF mutations were significantly less frequent (1.9% v 7.7%, respectively; P = .01). The mutational status of the matched pairs was highly concordant (> 90% concordance for all five genes). Clonality analysis of array CGH data suggested that multiple CRC primary tumors or treatment-associated effects were likely etiologies for mutational and/or copy number profile differences between primary tumors and metastases.;For determining RAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutational status, genotyping of the primary CRC is sufficient for most patients. Biopsy of a metastatic site should be considered in patients with a history of multiple primary carcinomas and in the case of TP53 for patients who have undergone interval treatment with radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Treatment of pulmonary recurrence from colorectal cancer involving the main bronchus usually entails palliation using interventional bronchoscopy, because the prognosis is generally very poor. Surgical experience has clarified that in this setting pneumonectomy should only be performed in carefully selected patients showing favorable prognostic profiles (defined by low carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels pre-thoracotomy), solitary and completely resectable pulmonary metastasis, and long disease-free intervals. In the few long-term survivors after pneumonectomy for late-recurrent colorectal cancer, the disease has a relatively indolent metastatic course and genetic and epigenetic profiling may provide further insight regarding tumor evolution.;We describe a rare case of late hilar-endobronchial and lymph nodal recurrence of rectal cancer, sequential to hepatic metastasectomy, that we successfully treated with pneumonectomy and chemotherapy (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin regimen); the patient achieved 7-year relapse-free survival after lung metastasectomy and 24-year overall survival after primary rectal cancer resection. To our knowledge, this is the longest survival reported after sequential liver resection and pneumonectomy for recurrent colorectal cancer. In our case the primary rectal cancer and its recurrences showed identical immunohistochemical patterns. The primary rectal cancer and the matched metastases (hepatic, pulmonary and lymph nodal) demonstrated no KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, a microsatellite stable phenotype, and no tumor protein p53 alterations or recurrent copy number alterations on chromosome 8. High genetic concordances between the paired primary tumor and metastases suggest that the key tumor biological traits remained relatively conserved in the three metastatic sites. Minor differences in gene specific hypermethylation were observed between the primary tumor and lung and nodal metastases. These differences suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may be causally involved in the microenvironmental regulation of cancer metastasis.;The exceptionally long survival of the patient in our case study involving favorable clinical features was related to an excellent response to surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy; however, genetic or epigenetic factors that remain unidentified cannot be excluded as contributory factors. Our findings support the concept of a common clonal origin of the primary cancer and synchronous and late metastases, and suggest that aberrant DNA methylation may regulate tumor dormancy mechanisms.",

We describe a novel EGFR exon 12 mutation acquired in tumors of 1 out of 3 patients treated with panitumumab. The EGFR G465R mutation introduces a positive charge within the overlap of the panitumumab and cetuximab epitopes. It abrogates antibody binding and mediates cross-resistance to both antibodies in EGFR G465R-transfected Ba/F3 cells. In circulating tumor DNA from an independent \"liquid biopsy\" cohort of 27 patients, we found this novel mutation in 1 out of 6 panitumumab-treated cases while about one third of patients show acquired RAS mutations.

The histopathologic appearance may be difficult to distinguish from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic interobserver agreement and to characterize the immunohistochemical and molecular differences between these two subgroups. Fifteen cases initially classified as medullary carcinoma and 30 cases of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas were included. Two pathologists reviewed the slides independently without knowledge of the original diagnosis and subgrouped the tumors into the two entities. Agreement was reached in 31 of 45 cases (69 %) with kappa = 0.32. An extensive immunohistochemical panel was performed, and KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutational status was assessed. Of the 31 cases with diagnostic agreement, the expression of only MLH-1 along with corresponding expression of PMS-2 differed significantly (p = 0.04). A high rate of BRAF mutations was detected in both subgroups without significant differences. Expression of MLH-1 was superior in dividing the tumors into two separate entities with significant differences in CK20 (p = 0.005) expression and in the rate of BRAF mutations (p = 0.0035). In conclusion, medullary carcinomas of the colon are difficult to discriminate from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma even with the help of immunohistochemical and molecular analyses. This raises the question whether these morphological subtypes should be maintained or whether an alternative classification of poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinomas based on MLH-1 status rather than morphology should be suggested.",

In colon cancer cells it induces DNA damage which leads to cytotoxicity with ensuing apoptosis or premature senescence. Despite its clinical use and efficiency in malignant colonocytes, its effects in normal colonic cells are relatively underexplored. In this work we report that CPT-11 induces dose-dependent cytotoxicity which results in apoptosis and premature senescence whose occurrence nevertheless varies in relation to the type of exposed cells. In normal colonic epithelial cells (NCM) the prevailing type of response is apoptosis whereas in normal colonic fibroblasts (NCF) it is premature senescence. Further analyses showed that CPT-11 induced in both types of cells DNA damage and activated stress response pathways including p53 and p16 but with varying activity of stress kinase p38 and selected stress-associated microRNAs. Epithelial cells upregulated the expression of p53, which was subsequently specifically phosphorylated, massively activated p38 and initiated mitochondrial, caspase-dependent apoptosis. These events occurred in the presence of moderately increased expression of miR-34a only. Conversely, in colonic fibroblasts p38 was only moderately activated, p53 as well as p16 expressions were upregulated in the presence of increased expression of miR-34a, miR-128a and miR-449a. Caspase-dependent apoptosis was found only in a minority of treated cells and the premature senescence phenotype was prevailing. Specific inhibition further proved that p53-dependent as well as independent mechanisms might be responsible for these cell type-specific differences.",

Constitutive activation of the three canonical family members, KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS segregate strongly by tissue type. Of these, KRAS mutations predominate in human tumors, including those arising from the colon and lung. We sought to compare the oncogenic contributions of different RAS isoforms in a comparable genetic setting and to explore downstream molecular changes that may explain the apparent differential oncogenic effects of the various RAS family members. We utilized colorectal cancer cell lines characterized by oncogenic KRAS in parallel with isogenically derived lines in which the mutant allele has been disrupted. We additionally attempted to reconstitute the isogenic derivatives with oncogenic forms of other RAS family members and analyze them in parallel. Pairwise analysis of HCT 116 and DLD-1 cell lines as well as their isogenic derivatives reveals distinct K-RAS(G13D) signatures despite the genetic similarities of these cell lines. In DLD-1, for example, oncogenic K-RAS enhances the motility of these cells by downregulation of Rap1 activity, yet is not associated with increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In HCT 116, however, ERK1/2 phosphorylation is elevated relative to the isogenic derivative, but Rap1 activity is unchanged. K-RAS is uniquely oncogenic in the colonic epithelium, though the molecular aspects of its oncogenic contribution are not necessarily conserved across cell lines. We therefore conclude that the oncogenic contribution of K-RAS is a function of its multifaceted functionality and is highly context-dependent.",

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007).

        "Doc_abstract":"In April 2013 our group published a review on predictive molecular pathology in this journal. Although only 2 years have passed many new facts and stimulating developments have happened in diagnostic molecular pathology rendering it worthwhile to present an up-date on this topic. A major technical improvement is certainly given by the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS; amplicon, whole exome, whole genome) and its application to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in routine diagnostics. Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs. In the near future this will open new strategies to apply 'off-label' targeted therapies, e.g. for rare tumors, otherwise resistant tumors etc. The clinically relevant genetic aberrations described in this review include mutation analyses of RAS (KRAS and NRAS), BRAF and PI3K in colorectal cancer, KIT or PDGFR alpha as well as BRAF, NRAS and KIT in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we present several recent advances in the molecular characterization of malignant lymphoma. Beside the well-known mutations in NSCLC (EGFR, ALK) a number of chromosomal aberrations (KRAS, ROS1, MET) have become relevant. Only very recently has the clinical need for analysis of BRCA1/2 come up and proven as a true challenge for routine diagnostics because of the genes' special structure and hot-spot-free mutational distribution. The genetic alterations are discussed in connection with their increasingly important role in companion diagnostics to apply targeted drugs as efficient as possible. As another aspect of the increasing number of druggable mutations, we discuss the challenges personalized therapies pose for the design of clinical studies to prove optimal efficacy particularly with respect to combination therapies of multiple targeted drugs and conventional chemotherapy. Such combinations would lead to an extremely high complexity that would hardly be manageable by applying conventional study designs for approval, e.g. by the FDA or EMA. Up-coming challenges such as the application of methylation assays and proteomic analyses on FFPE tissue will also be discussed briefly to open the door towards the ultimate goal of reading a patients' tissue as 'deeply' as possible. Although it is yet to be shown, which levels of biological information are most informative for predictive pathology, an integrated molecular characterization of tumors will likely offer the most comprehensive view for individualized therapy approaches. To optimize cancer treatment we need to understand tumor biology in much more detail on morphological, genetic, proteomic as well as epigenetic grounds. Finally, the complex challenges on the level of drug design, molecular diagnostics, and clinical trials make necessary a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies.

We determined the frequencies of tumor mutations in PIK3CA, BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, and PTEN by targeted next-generation sequencing and used logistic-regression models to compare them with those from patients with Lynch syndrome, MLH1-hypermethylated, or microsatellite-stable tumors. We validated our findings using independent data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas.;Among colorectal cancer cases, we found that 14 of 21 (67%) patients with double somatic tumors also had PIK3CA mutations, compared with 4 of 18 (22%) tumors from patients with Lynch syndrome, 2 of 10 (20%) tumors with MLH1 hypermethylation, and 12 of 78 (15%) tumors with microsatellite stability (P < .0001 for patients with double somatic tumors vs other subgroups). Mutations in PIK3CA were detected in all 13 patients with double somatic endometrial cancers (PÂ = .04 compared with other subgroups). We did not detect BRAF mutations in patients with double somatic colorectal tumors or Lynch syndrome. We found highly similar results in a validation cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (113 patients with colorectal tumors, 178 endometrial tumors); 100% of double somatic cases had a somatic mutation inÂ PIK3CA (P < .0001 compared with other subgroups).;Most patients with colorectal or endometrial tumors with 2 or more somatic (but not germline) mutations in MMR proteins also have mutations in PIK3CA; mutations in PIK3CA are detected at substantially higher frequencies in these double somatic tumors than in other microsatellite-instability subgroups. PIK3CA mutation status might be used to identify a specific group of colorectal tumors, and to select treatment or determine prognosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The colon is derived from the embryological midgut and hindgut separately, with the right colon and left colon having different features with regards to both anatomical and physiological characteristics. Cancers located in the right and left colon are referred to as right colon cancer (RCC) and left colon cancer (LCC), respectively, based on their apparent anatomical positions. Increasing evidence supports the notion that not only are there differences in treatment strategies when dealing with RCC and LCC, but molecular features also vary between them, not to mention the distinguishing clinical manifestations. Disease-free survival after radical surgery of both RCC and LCC are similar. In the treatment of RCC, the benefit gained from adjuvant FOLFIRI chemotherapy is superior, or at least similar, to LCC, but inferior to LCC if FOLFOX regimen is applied. On the other hand, metastatic LCC exhibits longer survival than that of RCC in a palliative chemotherapy setting. For KRAS wild-type cancers, LCC benefits more from cetuximab treatment than RCC. Moreover, advanced LCC shows a higher sensitivity to bevacizumab treatment in comparison with advanced RCC. Significant varieties exist at the molecular level between RCC and LCC, which may serve as the cause of all apparent differences. With respect to carcinogenesis mechanisms, RCC is associated with known gene types, such as MMR, KRAS, BRAF, and miRNA-31, while LCC is associated with CIN, p53, NRAS, miRNA-146a, miRNA-147b, and miRNA-1288. Regarding protein expression, RCC is related to GNAS, NQO1, telomerase activity, P-PDH, and annexin A10, while LCC is related to Topo I, TS, and EGFR. In addition, separated pathways dominate progression to relapse in RCC and LCC. Therefore, RCC and LCC should be regarded as two heterogeneous entities, with this heterogeneity being used to stratify patients in order for them to have the optimal, current, and novel therapeutic strategies in clinical practice. Additional research is needed to uncover further differences between RCC and LCC. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer. Two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have been approved for treatment of melanoma. Unfortunately, in most patients who initially respond the tumors eventually develop acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitors. So far, a number of resistance mechanisms have been identified, including secondary NRAS mutations and BRAF alternative splicing, leading to reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Other alterations, both upstream and downstream of BRAF can have the same effect, and activation of alternative pathways can also play a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In addition, intra-tumor heterogeneity with the presence of clones of tumor cells lacking BRAF mutations needs to be considered, since wildtype BRAF can be activated by inhibitors designed to target mutated BRAF. Combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib has significantly prolonged progression free survival compared to dabrafenib alone in metastatic melanoma. Combination treatments of BRAF inhibitors with other agents may not only circumvent or delay resistance, but may also lead to fewer side effects, such as development of secondary squamous tumors. Several clinical trials are underway for many different BRAF mutation positive cancers with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with other small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies or conventional chemotherapy.
