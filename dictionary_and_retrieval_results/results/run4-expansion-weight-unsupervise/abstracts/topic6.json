        "Doc_abstract":"The determination of NRAS and BRAF mutation status is a major requirement in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Mutation specific antibodies against NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins could offer additional data on tumor heterogeneity. The specificity and sensitivity of NRAS(Q61R) immunohistochemistry have recently been reported excellent. We aimed to determine the utility of immunohistochemistry using SP174 anti-NRAS(Q61R) and VE1 anti-BRAF(V600E) antibodies in the theranostic mutation screening of melanomas.;142 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanoma samples from 79 patients were analyzed using pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry.;23 and 26 patients were concluded to have a NRAS-mutated or a BRAF-mutated melanoma respectively. The 23 NRAS (Q61R) and 23 BRAF (V600E) -mutant samples with pyrosequencing were all positive in immunohistochemistry with SP174 antibody and VE1 antibody respectively, without any false negative. Proportions and intensities of staining were varied. Other NRAS (Q61L) , NRAS (Q61K) , BRAF (V600K) and BRAF (V600R) mutants were negative in immunohistochemistry. 6 single cases were immunostained but identified as wild-type using pyrosequencing (1 with SP174 and 5 with VE1). 4/38 patients with multiple samples presented molecular discordant data. Technical limitations are discussed to explain those discrepancies. Anyway we could not rule out real tumor heterogeneity.;In our study, we showed that combining immunohistochemistry analysis targeting NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins with molecular analysis was a reliable theranostic tool to face challenging samples of melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequently found in melanoma tumours, and recently developed BRAF-targeted therapies demonstrate significant clinical benefit.;We sought to investigate the clinical significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in a clinic-based metastatic melanoma cohort.;In total, 237 tumours, mostly metastatic lesions, from 203 patients were screened for mutations in exon 15 of BRAF and exon 2 of NRAS using Sanger sequencing. BRAF and NRAS mutation status was analysed in relation to clinical and histopathological characteristics, and outcome.;Mutation in BRAF and NRAS was present in 43% (88% V600E, 10% V600K) and 30% (48% Q61K, 40% Q61R) of metastatic melanomas, respectively. We found consistent BRAF and NRAS mutation status in all but one of 27 patients with multiple metastases. BRAF mutation was associated with younger age at primary diagnosis (P = 0.02). Among patients with distant metastatic melanoma, patients with BRAF-mutant tumours without BRAF inhibitor treatment had inferior survival compared with patients with BRAF inhibitor treatment [hazard ratio (HR) 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-5.01, P = 0.03]. We also observed a trend towards better prognosis for patients with wild-type and NRAS-mutant tumours compared with BRAF V600E-mutant tumours (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39-1.04, P = 0.07; and HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48-1.21, P = 0.25, respectively).;We were able to confirm the effect of BRAF inhibitor treatment in a single clinical institution. The results suggest further that BRAF mutation is a weak prognostic factor but a strong predictive factor and that BRAF-mutant melanoma might constitute one or more distinct subtypes of the disease with certain aetiology and clinical outcome.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We studied global gene expression in three melanoma cell lines with the most common and potent V600E mutation in the B-RAF gene-four cell lines with a common Q61R mutation in the N-RAS gene and three cell lines with no mutations using human HG-U133A 2.0 micro-arrays with 22 277 transcripts. Data analysis using stringent criteria revealed several upregulated and downregulated genes in cell lines with B-RAF and N-RAS mutations compared with cell lines without mutations. We found 29 genes specifically upregulated and 32 genes downregulated in cell lines with B-RAF mutations, whereas 70 genes were upregulated and 39 downregulated in cell lines with N-RAS mutations; 11 genes showed overlapping upregulation and 45 downregulation. The micro-array data for nine selected genes were validated by the real-time PCR technique. Expression of a large number of genes, that encode members or regulators of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways or are involved in metastasis or invasion, was affected in cell lines with mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS. Upregulated genes in cell lines with mutations included dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), sprouty 2 (SPRY2), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 (AKT3) and matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14); downregulated genes included interleukin 18 (IL18), Kr√ºppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) and inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2). Our results, though carried on cell lines, provide a novel insight into the effect of mutations in the B-RAF and N-RAS genes on global gene expression in melanoma and highlight the complexity of mechanisms involved in tumour initiation and maintenance.",
