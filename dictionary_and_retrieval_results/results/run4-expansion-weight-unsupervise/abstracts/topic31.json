Twenty-four of 29 (83%) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors displayed an absence of p16 nuclear staining using immunohistochemistry. Of these 24 tumors, we found that 16 (67%) harbored homozygous deletions, 5 (21%) were methylated, 1 displayed a rearrangement at the p16 locus, and 1 displayed a frameshift mutation in exon 1. These data suggest that: (a) inactivation of the p16 tumor suppressor gene is a frequent event in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck; (b) p16 is inactivated by several distinct and exclusive events including homozygous deletion, point mutation, and promoter methylation; and (c) immunohistochemical analysis for expression of the p16 gene product is an accurate and relatively simple method for evaluating p16 gene inactivation.",

No significant relationship was found between p16(INK4A) status and ATM loss, for patient outcome. We found 35.6% (n=26) of patients demonstrated polysomy of chromosome 11 (defined as the presence of a mean >2.5 copies of chromosome 11) which was significantly associated with p16(INK4A) negative status (p=0.0004), but did not influence outcome.;ATM loss is a frequent event in HNSCC, however it does not impact outcome after treatment with chemoradiation. Polysomy of chromosome 11 was significantly associated with p16(INK4A) negative status but also lacks prognostic significance.",

Although p16(INK4a) expression is used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection, there is controversy as to whether p16(INK4a) reliably indicates HPV infection. Here, to evaluate the accuracy of p16(INK4a) expression for determining HPV infection and the prognostic value of HPV infection and p16(INK4a) expression for HNSCC survival, especially oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) survival, 150 fresh-frozen HNSCC samples were analyzed for HPV DNA, E6/E7 mRNA and p16(INK4a) expression by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. p16(INK4a) expression was scored from 0 to 4 according to the percentage of p16(INK4a)-positive cells, with overexpression defined as >40% positive cells. Of the 150 tumor samples tested, 10 tumors were nasopharyngeal, 53 oropharyngeal, 39 hypopharyngeal, 24 laryngeal and 24 were located in the oral cavity. HPV DNA was detected in 47 (31.3%) samples, but only 21 also exhibited HPV mRNA expression. Inter-rater agreement was low between p16(INK4a) expression and HPV DNA presence and between p16(INK4a) expression and HPV mRNA expression, but was good between the combination of HPV DNA status and p16(INK4a) overexpression and HPV mRNA expression. Three-year recurrence-free survival was significantly higher for OPSCC patients who were HPV DNA-positive than for OPSCC patients who were HPV DNA-negative (P=0.008) and for OPSCC patients overexpressing p16(INK4a) than for without overexpressing p16(INK4a) (P=0.034). Multivariate analysis revealed that T1-3 stage and the combination of HPV DNA positivity and p16(INK4a) overexpression predicted significantly better recurrence-free survival. This combination is a more accurate marker for active HPV infection in HNSCC than HPV DNA status or general p16(INK4a)-positive status alone and offers a useful and reliable method for detecting and determining the prognosis of HPV-related HNSCC.",

Expression of the desmoglein isotypes correlated positively with each other except for desmoglein 2 and desmoglein 3, which did not show a significant correlation. Desmoglein 1 and E-cadherin expression also correlated.

Further statistical analysis of the prognostic significance of this small subgroup was not possible, but these three patients are alive and well.;Decreased expression of desmoglein 1 is associated with a worse prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer in the US. Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are associated with HNSCC tumorigenesis, including inactivation of CDKN2A, which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor, in cell lines and primary tumors by DNA methylation. Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors shows therapeutic promise for other cancers. Therefore, we investigated the ability of these agents to reactivate p16 in Tu159 HNSCC cells. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increases CDKN2A expression and slightly increases histone H3 acetylation at this gene. No reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but synergistic reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon sequential treatment of Tu159 cells with both 5-aza-dC and TSA. Silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 cells is correlated with increased methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and decreased methylation at lysine 4 relative to the upstream p15 gene promoter. Interestingly, global levels of H3-K9 methylation are decreased upon treatment with 5-aza-dC. Together these data indicate that DNA methylation is a dominant epigenetic mark for silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 tumor cells. Moreover, changes in DNA methylation can reset the histone code by impacting multiple H3 modifications.",

Complex interactions between a set of molecules, cell cycle proteins, tumour suppressor genes, oncogenes and the telomerase, occur in the multiple step process of carcinogenesis. The 2 main ways of control of the cell cycle rely on 2 tumour suppressor genes: the P53 gene and the retinoblastoma gene or RB gene. One of the regulation pathways or the 2 regulation pathways are disabled during the development of oral and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Most of the time, the inactivation of the P53 pathway results from a loss of function of the p53 protein, secondary to mutation and/or deletion of the P53 gene; It may also result of the amplification of the MDM2 gene and of the inactivation of the arf protein. The RB pathway leads to cell proliferation by loss of the p16 protein, by amplification of the cyclin D1 gene and less frequently by mutation of the RB gene or loss of the retinoblastoma protein. In India and South-East Asia, the activation of RAS and MYC oncogenes appears to be related with the presence of specific carcinogens in snuff and tobacco.

All eight of the HNSCC cell lines did not express the p16 protein, and in two of these cell lines (Amc-HN-6 and 8), this was due to a deletion of the p16 gene. Three of the cell lines (Amc-HN-3 to 5) that expressed the p16 mRNA had the same nonsense mutation at codon 50 (CGA-Arg to TGA-Ter). The Amc-HN-1 and Amc-HN-7 cell lines, which did not express the p16 mRNA, had a missense mutation at codon 9 (GCC-Ala to GTC-Val) and a silent mutation at codon 106 (CCC-Pro to CCA), respectively. The Amc-HN-2 cell line (p16 exon-positive/mRNA-negative) had a single base deletion at codon 38 (CGG-Arg to CG), which resulted in a frameshift and a consequent stop signal at codon 44. The Rb protein was detected in all of the eight cell lines, although it was inactive in five of these due to hyperphosphorylation. The inverse relationship between p16 and Rb was 62.5% (5/8). Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in all of the eight cell lines.

To clarify this, stemness molecule expressions were determined in HNSCC, as well as their properties and prognosis. Two proto-oncogenic chromatin regulators, Bmi-1 and high-mobility-group A2 (Hmga2), were identified in 12 pair cases of HNSCC tumor regions by comparison with their non-cancerous background tissues using cDNA microarray. Both Bmi-1 and Hmga2 are known to promote stem cell self-renewal by negatively regulating the expressions of Ink4a and Arf tumor suppressors. Despite similar targets, Bmi-1 protein was expressed in an early cancerous region and HMGA2 protein was expressed in a region showing more progression. Similarly, Bmi1 expression had no significance with regard to overall survival (P=0.67), whereas HMGA2 expression was associated with decreased overall survival (P=0.05). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses also correlated with protein levels. These findings suggest that Bmi-1 is an early detection marker to distinguish cancerous from non-cancerous regions, whereas HMGA2 is presumed to be a tumor prognosis marker. Among our HNSCC analyses, these stemness molecules expressed fewer primitive rare cells in the tumor than all other cells in the tumor.

The objectives of this study were to (1) assess whether HPV-DNA and/or p16 status are systematically evaluated across North American otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons and (2) whether the status is used to direct treatment approach.;A 15-question online survey was sent to three associations: the Association of Oto-rhino-laryngology-Head and Neck Surgery of Quebec, the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Head and Neck Society.;Sixty-seven percent of respondents systematically test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 on HNSCC sites, while 58.3% report using test results to direct treatment for oropharyngeal cancers. A lack of official guidelines was the primary reason (81.8%) physicians did not use test results to direct treatment. Academic centre physicians (83.3%) and physicians with ⩾50% oncologic practice (87.6%) were more likely to test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 in HNSCC compared to non-academic centre physicians (39.7%) and physicians with <50% oncologic practices (51.4%) (p<0.001). Cost of the tests (69.2%), lack of relevance (46.1%) and time constraints (30.8%) were the primary reasons HPV-DNA and/or p16 were not tested.;The majority of North American respondents in this survey systematically test for HPV-DNA and/or p16 in HNSCC sites, and most indicate that test results influence their treatment approach for oropharyngeal cancers.",

Little knowledge exists on the interaction of HPV16 infection and promoter methylation in HNSCC. The promoter methylation status of 12 genes (TIMP3, CDH1, CDKN2A, DAPK1, transcription factor 21 (TCF21), CD44, MLH1, MGMT, RASSF1, cyclin A1 (CCNA1), LARS2, and CEBPA) was evaluated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 55 primary HNSCC and 31 controls. The results were correlated with HPV16 status and clinicopathological characteristics. CCNA1 and p53 protein expression were additionally determined by immunohistochemistry and compared with p53 mutation status. Methylation of DAPK1 (P = 0.043), CCNA1 (P = 0.016) and TCF21 (P = 0.0005) was significantly more present in HNSCC than in controls. The genes TIMP3 (P = 0.018) and CCNA1 (P = 0.015) showed higher methylation frequency in HPV16 positive HNSCC compared to HPV16 negative tumors. CCNA1 methylation did not correlate with CCNA1 protein expression and p53 mutation, respectively. Methylation of TCF21 was associated with higher age (P = 0.044) and nicotine abuse (P = 0.035). Methylation of CCNA1 was significantly more present in females (P = 0.003). Methylation of TCF21 and CCNA1 are important risk factors for HNSCC development.

Histopathologically negative surgical margins of hypermethylated tumors were collected, and their methylation status compared with the primary tumor status.;Promoter hypermethylation in at least one of the three tested genes was detected in 65% (13 of 20) of tumors. MGMT was hypermethylated in 50% (10 of 20), DAP-K in 45% (9 of 20), and p16 in 20% (4 of 20) of tumors. Methylation status was analyzed in 35 margins from 11 of 13 patients showing promoter hypermethylation in the tumor tissue. Identical methylation events were seen for at least one gene in primary tumor and surgical margins in 9 of 11 cases (82%).

Here, FDG uptake is analyzed in relation to expression of a selected panel of IHC cancer biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).;IHC staining for Bcl-2, β-tubulin-1 and 2, p53, EGFR, Ki-67, glutathione-S-transferase-π and p16 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded diagnostic biopsies from 102 HNSCC cases treated at Rigshospitalet during 2005-2009. The proportion of positive cells was used for analyses, except p16, which was scored according to EORTC guidelines. In all cases, maximal FDG standardized uptake value (SUV) metrics were extracted for the primary tumor, TSUVmax. Univariate linear regression and multiple linear regression of TSUVmax versus IHC markers were performed.;In univariate analyses, TSUVmax showed negative associations with Bcl-2 (p = 0.002) and p16 (p = 0.005) indices and positive association with β-tubulin-1 index (p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, TSUVmax remained associated with β-tubulin-1 (p = 0.009), Bcl-2 (p = 0.03) and p16 (p = 0.03).

Mutations and copy-number aberrations were determined and results validated with a secondary method.;The overall mutational burden in HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC was similar with an average of 15.2 versus 14.4 somatic exonic mutations in the targeted cancer-associated genes. HPV-negative tumors showed a mutational spectrum concordant with published lung squamous cell carcinoma analyses with enrichment for mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, MLL2, CUL3, NSD1, PIK3CA, and NOTCH genes. HPV-positive tumors showed unique mutations in DDX3X, FGFR2/3 and aberrations in PIK3CA, KRAS, MLL2/3, and NOTCH1 were enriched in HPV-positive tumors. Currently targetable genomic alterations were identified in FGFR1, DDR2, EGFR, FGFR2/3, EPHA2, and PIK3CA.

The VRK1 protein phosphorylates several transcription factors and has been postulated to be involved in regulation of cell proliferation. In normal squamous epithelium, VRK1 is expressed in the proliferation area. Because VRK1 can stabilize p53, the expression of the VRK1 protein was analyzed in the context of the p53 pathway and the proliferation phenotype in a series of 73 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. VRK1 protein level positively correlated with p53 response proteins, particularly hdm2 and p21. The VRK1 protein also correlated positively with several proteins associated with proliferation, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK6, cdc2, cyclins B1 and A, topoisomerase II, survivin, and Ki67. The level of VRK1 protein behaves like a proliferation marker in this series of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. To identify a possible regulatory role for VRK1 and because it regulates gene transcription, the promoters of two genes were studied, CDK2 and SURVIVIN, whose proteins correlated positively with VRK1. VRK1 increases the activity of both the CDK2 and SURVIVIN gene promoters. The expression of VRK1 was analyzed in the context of regulators of the G1-S transition. VRK1 protein levels increase in response to E2F1 and are reduced by retinoblastoma and p16. These data suggest that VRK1 might play a role in cell cycle regulation and is likely to represent the beginning of a new control mechanism of cell cycle, particularly late in the G1-S phase.",

To investigate this heterogeneity, we analysed 307 HNSCC cases (tonsillar, n=135; non-tonsillar, n=172) from eight health care centers mostly from Northern Germany and determined HPV-DNA/mRNA and p16INK4A-status and combined results with the patient outcome. Overall HPV-DNA prevalence rate was 23.5% (72/307); attributed to: 43.7% (59/135) and 7.6% (13/172) tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases, respectively. Among these, 96.6% tonsillar and 38.5% non-tonsillar SCC were HPV-mRNA-positive. Although the study cohort was composed of patients from regions of rather close proximity, prevalence rates showed diversities of up to 40% in HNSCC subsite analysis with the lowest prevalence for tonsillar SCC in metropolitan areas (22.2%) vs. 50.9% in rural areas. Survival analysis identified p16INK4A alone as strongest predictor, followed by HPV-DNA-status alone or in combination with p16INK4A. This survival benefit was shown for tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases. Smoking significantly correlated with HPV-status, however, it does not influence survival when stratified for HPV. In conclusion, the data emphasize the urge for further data on HPV-infection in HNSCC to, e.g. clarify to what extent survival benefits of p16INK4A-positive patients are truly attributed to HPV-infections.

In mild dysplasia, SH3GL2, p16(INK4a), and p14(ARF) showed a higher frequency of overall alterations (60-70%) than in p15(INK4b) (40%). However, in subsequent stages of tumour progression, the alteration frequency of these genes did not change significantly. One novel mutation in common exon 2 of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and three in exon 9 of SH3GL2 were seen. Concordance was seen in the expression of these genes with their molecular alterations. Deletions of INK4A-ARF and p15(INK4b) have a significant poor patient outcome. The alterations of p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), and p15(INK4b) were positively correlated with tobacco and inversely with HPV, while SH3GL2 alterations were independent of these factors. Based on aetiological factors, four tumour subtypes were recognized: HPV(-)tobacco(-) (I), HPV(+)tobacco(-) (II), HPV(-)tobacco(+) (III), and HPV(+)tobacco(+) (IV). Groups III and IV showed a high frequency of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF)/p15(INK4b) alterations with significant poor patient outcome in comparison to group II. Our findings suggest that deregulation of SH3GL2-associated signalling and p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF)/p15(INK4b)-mediated G1-S/G2-M checkpoints of cell cycle are independent pathways for the development of early dysplastic lesions of the head and neck.",

Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP) of CDKN2A, CCNA1 and DCC were performed in these specimens and correlated with clinical data. Of the 42 patients eligible for the study, 27 were hypermethylation informative for the above three genes. This latter group was associated with longer disease-free survivals (P=0.007) and longer time to disease-specific deaths (P=0.004). Multivariate analyses confirmed hypermethylation non-informative tumours as an independent prognosticating factor for disease-specific deaths (risk ratio 3.8, P=0.026). Quantitative MSP of the margins of 24 hypermethylation informative tumours revealed that 11 patients had molecularly positive margins, of which, five developed disease-specific events (DSEs, three local recurrences and two metastases), compared to none in patients with molecularly negative margins, after a median follow-up of 48 months. Log-rank analyses showed that molecularly positive margins were associated with shorter time to local recurrences and disease-specific deaths (P=0.03 and 0.01, respectively). This study demonstrated that QMSP of hypermethylated promoters in surgical margins predicted all the local recurrences in our series of HNSCC patients.

The ansamycin-based Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in phase I/II clinical testing. However, 17-AAG is difficult to formulate and displays weak activity against some tumors. A novel dimeric ansamycin, EC5, was evaluated for antitumor activity in eight head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. Both 17-AAG and EC5 inhibited tumor cell proliferation effectively, but EC5 was more potent, with IC(50) below 200 nmol/L in most cell lines tested, including several lines that were resistant to 17-AAG. The inability of 17-AAG to kill JHU12 cells was linked to a defect in retinoblastoma signaling and could be rescued by ectopic expression of p16(INK4a). EC5 induced G(1) growth arrest of tumor cells and apoptosis, with the degradation of client proteins including epidermal growth factor receptor, c-Raf-1, Akt, and Cdk4 and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. In vivo, EC5 dramatically reduced the growth rate of established HNSCC xenografts in nude mice and decreased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and Akt within the xenografts. These results suggest that this novel ansamycin-based Hsp90 inhibitor affects multiple pathways involved in tumor development and progression and may represent a new strategy for the treatment of HNSCC patients.",

These tumors occur more frequently in the tonsils and oropharyngeal sites, among younger patients, higher socioeconomic group, and those exposed to more sexual partners and oral sex compared with HPV-negative HNSCC. Although tobacco- and alcohol-related HNSCCs appear to be on the decline, tonsillar and oropharyngeal HPV-associated tumors seem to be on the rise, and their prevalence varies widely in published reports, ranging from 20% to 60%. Human papilloma virus detection methods in tumor tissue vary and include polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization (ISH) technique for HPV DNA, and E6/E7 messenger RNA, with p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a surrogate marker. The sensitivity and specificity of the different methods used are likely contributory factors to this wide variation. This study compares the p16 IHC staining patterns in HNSCC and laryngeal papillomas and assesses the concordance of p16 and high-risk HPV-ISH to determine the usefulness of p16 as a first-line marker. Using an objective criterion of diffuse intense confluent staining pattern as definite positive (akin to the 3+ of HER2/neu in breast cancer) and focal scattered staining pattern as equivocal reaction requiring confirmatory HPV assay, p16 IHC expression shows good concordance with high-risk HPV-ISH and can be used as a first-line marker.

From a cohort of 153 OTSCC patients, 131 formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks of pre-treatment primary tumours were suitable for further molecular analysis. We assessed CDKN2A (p16) levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC), promoter methylation status by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, mutation status by Sanger sequencing, gene copy number variation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and correlated these with patient outcome. We found that the majority of OTSCC did not overexpress p16 (110/116, 95%), assessed by IHC. The frequency of CDKN2A mutations was 20% (21/103), homozygous loss was 7% (7/97), hemizygous loss 31% (30/97), and promoter methylation was 18% (20/113). We found no evidence of these mechanisms in 24/106 (23%) p16 IHC negative tumours. No significant correlation was identified between any potential mechanism of CDKN2A inactivation and clinical features, including smoking status and age. There was a non-significant trend for worse overall survival for p16 IHC negative patients versus positive patients (HR = 1.81, 95% CI = 0.44-7.47, p = 0.40).

The purpose of the current study was to investigate an association among p16 (CDKN2A) gene polymorphism at rs11515, age, and HNSCC aggressiveness. PCR-RFLP analysis was used to investigate the p16 (CDKN2A) gene in 96 patients with HNSCC and in 100 individuals without HNSCC. A case group was categorized by age in younger (<60 years) and older (≥ 60 years) patients. Differences between the case and control groups were determined using Fisher and chi-squared tests. Time of survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up visit or to the date of death using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and comparing this to the log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. In the present study, no association was established between HNSCC and rs11515 polymorphism, as indicated in a previous study. We found that HNSCC individuals with large-sized tumors and with metastatic disease presented worse overall survival, consistent with fundamental concepts that establish the effects of tumor size and lymph node metastasis to HNSCC outcomes.

Here, we studied the prognostic impact of the most prevalent connexin isotype, connexin 43 (Cx43) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Tissue microarrays made from tumor samples of 90 HNSCC patients were immunostained for Cx43 and cell cycle regulation-related biomarkers including p53, Ki67, p16, aurora A, geminin, and p21 proteins.

Dissected neck metastases were analyzed for p16 overexpression by immunohistochemistry, and the presence of HPV DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization.;Of the 33 patients, 8 (24%) exhibited p16 overexpression. p16-positive lymph node metastases contained significantly more HPV DNA and were most frequently associated with occult primary lesions in the oropharynx and a favorable prognosis. Patients with a lower alcohol consumption, only level II/III metastasis, and cystic lymph node metastasis tended to have p16 overexpression.;This is the first report on the relationship of HNSCCUP with p16 and HPV DNA status in Asian patients. In total, 24% of the HNSCCUP patients were p16 positive. p16 overexpression in neck metastasis was predictive of both an occult primary lesion in the oropharynx and an association with HPV infection. Alcohol consumption, location, and features of neck metastasis were correlated with p16 expression.",

Molecular genetic studies have revealed that deletions in CDKN2A occur frequently in cancer. Although p16 (INK4a) may be involved in tumor progression, the clinical impact and prognostic implications in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the immunohistochemical expression of p16 (INK4a) in 40 oropharynx and 35 larynx from HNSCC patients treated in a single institution and followed-up at least for 10 years in order to explore potential associations with clinicopathological outcomes and prognostic implications. Forty cases (53.3%) were positive for p16 (INK4a) and this expression was more intense in non-smoking patients (P = 0.050), whose tumors showed negative vascular embolization (P = 0.018), negative lymphatic permeation (P = 0.002), and clear surgical margins (P = 0.050). Importantly, on the basis of negative p16 (INK4a) expression, it was possible to predict a probability of lower survival (P = 0.055) as well as tumors presenting lymph node metastasis (P = 0.050) and capsular rupture (P = 0.0010). Furthermore, increased risk of recurrence was observed in tumors presenting capsular rupture (P = 0.0083). Taken together, the alteration in p16 (INK4a) appears to be a common event in patients with oropharynx and larynx squamous cell carcinoma and the negative expression of this protein correlated with poor prognosis.",

Consequently, promoter hypermethylation, being the most important aberrant epigenetic characteristic, has been intensively investigated for its biomarker potential in this cancer type. As many of these evaluations are obscured by a heterogeneity of treatments, the current study aimed to evaluate the incidence and prognostic value of the promoter hypermethylation of TIMP3, CDH1, DAPK, RASSF1A, p16INK4A and MGMT in HNSCC treated solely by radiotherapy. In 46 patients with advanced HNSCC treated with a hybrid accelerated fractionation radiotherapy schedule, DNA extracted from pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies was used to determine the methylation status of the genes of interest by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The detected epigenetic silencing was related with outcome in terms of locoregional control (LRC), and overall (OS), disease-free (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Tumor biopsies revealed the epigenetic silencing of MGMT in 42.5% (17 of 40) of patients and of TIMP3 in 40.5% (17 of 42) of cases. For the remaining investigated genes, a lower methylation percentage was detected: 13.2% (5 of 38) for CDH1, 11.4% (4 of 44) for DAPK, 4.8% (2 of 42) for p16INK4A and 2.4% (1 of 41) for RASSF1A. The promoter hypermethylation of TIMP3 and CDH1 was significantly related with better LRC (p=0.009 and p=0.02, respectively), OS (p=0.005 and p=0.002, respectively), DFS (p=0.02 and p=0.004, respectively) and DSS (p=0.12 and p=0.007, respectively). In conclusion, in this representative group of 46 patients with advanced HNSCC treated by radiotherapy only, the epigenetic silencing of TIMP3 and CDH1 predicted a better outcome.",

Promoter hypermethylation of these genes separately or in combination was not associated with history of smoking and alcohol use, tumor size, nodal status, clinical stage, and overall survival. Promoter hypermethylation of more than 1 gene was significantly associated with increased 2-year disease-free survival. The probability of surviving 2 years without tumor recurrence was 100% with promoter hypermethylation in 2 or 3 genes and 46% with promoter hypermethylation in none or just 1 gene (P=.013). Promoter hypermethylation of 2 or 3 genes was independently related to increased 2-year cumulative disease-free survival (P=.028).;Promoter hypermethylation of hMLH1, MGMT, and p16 genes was commonly detected in 47 SCCHN cases with up to 65% showing aberrant promoter hypermethylation in at least 1 gene. Promoter hypermethylation of 2 or 3 genes was significantly associated with increased 2-year disease-free survival, suggesting that promoter hypermethylation of multiple genes might improve survival.

The current study aims to evaluate p16 IHC in FNA and establish guidelines for its interpretation. The percentage and intensity of p16 IHC staining were examined in 60 matched FNA and surgical cases. Cytomorphologic features were included in the analysis. p16 IHC staining was correlated with the results seen in the surgical specimens and with HPV in situ hybridization (ISH). Analysis of different thresholds demonstrated that the threshold of 10% p16 tumor cell positivity had the best overall concordance rate with surgical p16 IHC (κ = 0.650) and with FNA HPV-ISH (κ = 0.714). Applying the recommended p16 positivity threshold for surgical specimens (70%) on FNA materials resulted in low sensitivity (39%) and low negative predictive value (26%). In comparison with p16 IHC in surgical specimens, 6/46 FNA cases (13%) were falsely negative for p16. All 6 cases were associated with necrotic background, two (33%) lacked large tumor clusters, and one (17%) had low cellularity. The recommended threshold for p16 IHC on surgical specimens should not be used in cytology materials. The cutoff value for p16 immunostain in FNA specimens showing best results in our series is 10%.

In this study, we characterized the effects of two novel biosynthetically engineered analogs of pactamycin, de-6MSA-7-demethyl-7-deoxypactamycin (TM-025) and 7-demethyl-7-deoxypactamycin (TM-026), in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines SCC25 and SCC104. Both TM-025 and TM-026 exert growth inhibitory effects on HNSCC cells by inhibiting cell proliferation. Interestingly, unlike their parent compound pactamycin, the analogs do not inhibit synthesis of nascent protein in a cell-based assay. Furthermore, they do not induce apoptosis or autophagy in a dose- or a time-dependent manner, but induce mild senescence in the tested cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that both analogs significantly induce cell cycle arrest of the HNSCC cells at S-phase resulting in reduced accumulation of G2/M-phase cells. The pactamycin analogs induce expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins including master regulator p53, its downstream target p21Cip1/WAF1, p27kip21, p19, cyclin E, total and phospho Cdc2 (Tyr15) and Cdc25C. Besides, the analogs mildly reduce cyclin D1 expression without affecting expression of cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cdk4. Specific inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-α reduces the percentage of cells accumulated in S-phase, suggesting contribution of p53 to S-phase increase. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Pactamycin analogs TM-025 and TM-026 induce senescence and inhibit proliferation of HNSCC cells via accumulation in S-phase through possible contribution of p53. The two PCT analogs can be widely used as research tools for cell cycle inhibition studies in proliferating cancer cells with specific mechanisms of action. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck (HNSCC) are a result of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations. Epigenetic inactivation of tumor suppressor genes is an important event in head and neck carcinogenesis. Here we analyzed the promoter methylation of 15 genes (RASSF1A, p16, MGMT, DAPK, RARbeta, MLH1, CDH1, GSTP1, RASSF2, RASSF4, RASSF5, MST1, MST2, LATS1, LATS2) in 54 HNSCC and in matching 23 normal tissues. Methylation of these tumor-related genes (TRG) was significantly more frequent in HNSCC (42%) compared to normal samples (23%; p<0.05). Particularly, methylation of p16 (60%), MGMT (53%), DAPK (67%), RARbeta (75%), MLH1 (69%), CDH1 (43%), RASSF5 and MST1 (96%) was often found in HNSCC. Methylation of RASSF1A (18%), GSTP1 (4%), RASSF4 (13%), MST2 (4%), LATS1 (24%) and LATS2 (8%) was less frequently detected. A trend of increased TRG methylation in more advanced tumor stages and less differentiated HNSCC was observed. Methylation of p16 was significantly higher in poorly differentiated HNSCC (p=0.037) and RASSF5 methylation occurred preferentially in advanced tumor stages (p<0.05). Methylation of RASSF4 was higher in patients with recurrent HNSCC (23%) than patients without relapse (0%; p=0.033). Methylation of TRG in head and neck cancer cell lines was observed at similar frequency as in primary HNSCC. In summary, frequent hyper-methylation of tumor-related genes in HNSCC was detected and this epigenetic silencing event may have an essential role in head and neck carcinogenesis.",

However, cases of ambiguous p16(INK4a) overexpression are regularly detected in the head and neck: p16(INK4a) expression can be observed in non-malignant tissue, such as tonsillar crypt epithelium and a proportion of branchial cleft cysts. Additionally, diverse patterns of p16(INK4) expression can complicate interpretation of \"p16(INK4a) -positivity\". These aspects impede the unrestricted application of p16(INK4a) as a diagnostic marker in the head and neck. We hypothesized that combined detection of p16(INK4a) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 could support clarification of ambiguous p16(INK4a) expression in the head and neck by specifically indicating p16(INK4a) -expressing cells with proliferative activity. p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression in a combined staining procedure was correlated to distinct p16(INK4a) expression patterns and HPV status (HPV DNA followed by E6*I oncogene mRNA detection) in 147 HNSCC and 50 non-malignant head and neck samples. p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression only occurred in transformed cells of the head and neck. Co-expression was never detected in non-transformed cells. Combined p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 expression was stringently associated with a diffuse p16(INK4a) expression pattern. All HPV oncogene-expressing HNSCC showed p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression. We demonstrate that p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression occurs exclusively in transformed cells of the head and neck. Our findings indicate a substantial impact of combined p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 expression in the assessment of ambiguous p16(INK4a) expression in the head and neck by specifically identifying p16(INK4a) -expressing cells with proliferative activity.

In addition, human papillomavirus infection determined by PCR assay and the use of alcohol and cigarettes were evaluated. In this study 28 non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia and 57 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were considered. The expression levels of fragile histidine triad were lower in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma than in non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia. In contrast, p16INK4a is expressed in malignant lesions (51% of the cases analyzed), but not in non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia. No correlation between gene expression alterations of the two tumor suppressors was observed. PCR analysis showed that HPV DNA was present in 5 of the 57 malignant lesions analyzed (8.8%). None of the factors described above, despite changes in gene expression and HPV infection, appears to be associated with alcohol use and/or tobacco smoking and clinical outcome. Our data showed that fragile histidine triad and p16INK4a expression are altered in malignant lesions.

Tobacco use and heavy alcohol consumption are known risk factors for HNSCC but in other cases human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked to carcinogenesis. HPV proteins E6 and E7 promote oncogenesis by blocking the action of p53 and pRB, respectively. An absence of p53 mutations in addition to expression of p16 are part of the distinct molecular profile identified in the subset of HNSCCs because of HPV. Various methods are available for HPV detection but polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization techniques are commonly used. Both methods are amenable for testing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue that is a sample type readily available to the pathologist. HPV is detectable in approximately a quarter of all HNSCCs, and is particularly prevalent in the oropharynx in which the positivity rates approach 40%. A vast majority of HPV-related HNSCCs are owing to HPV type 16 with types 18, 31, and 33 accounting for almost all of the remaining cases. HPV-related HNSCCs are associated with better prognosis for both recurrence and survival. This group of tumors has also been shown to respond well to radiation treatment. As the clinical relevance of HPV in HNSCCs continues to emerge, anatomic pathologists are likely to receive increasing requests for testing.

LOH at the p53 gene did not increase significantly with tumor stage, but was more frequent in moderately and poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. LOH plus mutation or homozygous deletion of p53 was limited to advanced stage and poorly differentiated tumors. Allelic loss at 9p21 is frequent in early stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is not significantly associated with LOH at p53. The second exon of the p16/MTS1/CDKN2 gene was found to be homozygously deleted in 1 of 19 cases showing LOH at 9p21, but direct sequencing did not show mutations in the remaining 18 cases. This suggests that p16 plays a limited role in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",

The reactivation of telomerase activity and losses or gains of specific chromosomal regions, which point to deletions of tumor suppressor genes or amplification of oncogenes are supposed to be the molecular processes during the development and progression of head and neck cancer. Therefore, we analyzed telomerase activity and microsatellite markers using a genome wide panel of 28 microsatellite markers in 38 head and neck squamous-cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Our microsatellite marker set included distinct chromosomal areas that all likely harbor genes contributing to the carcinogenesis of HNSCC. DNA or protein lysates were obtained from primary tumors and compared to peripheral lymphocytes or corresponding normal tissue. At least one genomic alteration [loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or microsatellite instability (MSI)] was found in 31 of the 38 cases (82%). Most frequently we detected an LOH in the chromosomal region 9p12-21 where at least the tumor suppressor genes (TSG) p16INK4A, p14ARF and p15INKB are localized. The comparison between grade two and grade three tumors showed a highly changed frequency of LOH in the chromosomal region 7q31, where a putative TSG is predicted. Telomerase activity was present in 31/37 (83.8%) tumor samples independent of the histopathological staging and grading of the tumors. These molecular characterizations of HNSCC may be a further hint for the involvement of additional, so far unknown, TSGs in the tumor progression and will elucidate the regulation of telomerase.",

Despite considerable efforts, the 5-year survival rate for HNSCC has not changed significantly. To improve this situation, it is necessary to understand the fundamental biological processes leading to the disease and its progression. In addition to known genetic changes in HNSCC, molecular cytogenetic investigations have identified chromosomal regions of gains and losses, but many of the responsible candidate genes have yet to be identified. Furthermore, recent results indicate the importance of epigenetic modifications in HNSCC, such as DNA methylation. Several genes, including the tumor suppressor CDKN2A and other candidates such as DAPK1, MGMT, TIMP3, TCF21, and C/EBPalpha, have been found to harbor hypermethylated regulatory sequences that lead to reduced expression or gene silencing. Hypermethylation in such genes could be used not only as biomarkers for the early detection of HNSCC but also to improve prevention strategies and therapy outcomes.",

The objective of this study was to use different methods for the analysis of the incidence of changes at the INK4a locus in head and neck cancer (HNSCC). Primary tumours were analysed for allelic imbalances (AI) with microsatellite markers for chromosome 9, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and IHC with enhanced sensitivity by tyramide signal amplification (TSA-IHC), and by RT-PCR. No homozygous deletions at 9p21 were detected. AI at 9p21, which was found in approximately 60% of the tumours, completely failed to indicate the functional inactivation of the two INK4a gene products. Immunostaining of normal squamous epithelia revealed very low levels of p16(INK4a), whereas p14(ARF) was readily detectable. In 160 tumours, IHC suggested a loss of p16(INK4a) expression in 90%. However, by TSA-IHC, only 53.7% showed loss of p16(INK4a) expression, and this was consistent with the RT-PCR analyses. In 100 tumours analysed for both proteins, selective loss of p16(INK4a) occurred in 37%; loss of p14(ARF) was found in only 15%, and selective loss in only 4%; 11% of the tumours had lost both proteins. We conclude that only IHC with high sensitivity and the combined expression analysis of mRNAs and proteins is suitable for studying the role of INK4a in HNSCC.

We and others found that p16INK4a overexpression is associated with improved therapy response and survival of patients with HNSCC treated with radiotherapy. However, the functional role of p16INK4a in HNSCC remains unexplored. Our results implicate p16INK4a in regulation of homologous recombination-mediated DNA damage response independently from its role in control of the cell cycle. We found that expression of p16INK4a dramatically affects radiation sensitivity of HNSCC cells. p16INK4a overexpression impairs the recruitment of RAD51 to the site of DNA damage in HPV-positive cells by downregulating of cyclin D1 protein expression. Consistent with the in vitro findings, immunostaining of HNSCC patient samples revealed that high levels p16INK4a expression significantly correlated with decreased cyclin D1 expression.

Differences between normal epithelium and cancer cells from the upper aerodigestive tract arise from alterations in expression of specific genes controlling proliferation and immortalization. The protein products of these genes include growth factor receptors, cell cycle regulators, and tumor suppressors which affect a variety of intracellular signaling pathways. To determine how altered expression of these gene products contribute to HNSCC progression, we examined expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cyclins, p16INK4A, c-myc, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and telomerase in archival pathology specimens by immunohistochemistry. A substantial majority of HNSCC tumors showed loss of p16INK4A expression and dramatic overexpression of EGFR. Overexpression of this receptor correlated with increased cyclin A levels and high mitotic index. EGFR, cyclins A, -B1, -E, and c-myc overexpression was significantly increased in stage III and IV tumors compared to early stage cancers. hTERT was expressed in all tumors and primarily in the basal layer cells of dysplastic epithelial lesions. Suprabasal expression of hTERT was found in a significantly higher number of HNSCC cases than in dysplastic lesions.

The prevalence of p16(INK4a), DAP-kinase, E-Cadherin, and RASSF1A promoter methylation was 26/80 (32.5%), 19/80 (23.8%), 29/80 (36.3%), 6/80 (7.5%) respectively. In 48 cases (60%), at least one of these promoters was methylated. There was a significant association of methylation of any of these genes and ever smoking (P=0.006). p16(INK4a) gene promoter methylation was associated with a younger age of smoking initiation (P<0.03); E-Cadherin promoter methylation was associated with an increased number of pack years smoked (P<0.03). We also found an association of methylation of any gene and T status (OR=2.7, P<0.05). Tumors with p16(INK4a) methylation were significantly less likely to show lymph node metastasis (P<0.001). DAP-kinase promoter methylation was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and this relationship was dependent upon p16(INK4a) promoter methylation status. Our results suggest that, in HNSCC, promoter methylation of these four genes accumulates with increasing tumor size. This may reflect distinct pathways of somatic inactivation leading to cancer; additional larger studies are needed to further investigate this possibility. Tobacco smoking may play an important role in both the occurrence of promoter methylation as well as delineating the precise pathway that eventually results in a tumorigenic phenotype.",

Recently we reported ethanol-induced proliferation in a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cell line, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In order to further clarify these findings, major G0/G1-regulating proteins were investigated in the present study. Synchronized cells of a SCCHN line (JP-PA) and a human immortalized keratinocyte line (HaCaT)-used as a control-were cultured with or without 10(-3) M ethanol for up to 96 h. At distinct time intervals the expression of cyclin D1 and the inhibitors p16, p18, p19 and p21 were determined by Western blot analyses. In both lines ethanol had no influence on the protein expression of cyclin D1. In contrast, distinct downregulations of p21, p18 and p19 were detectable at the protein level. The p16 protein was not expressed in the SCCHN line and was unchanged in the control line after the addition of ethanol. In these in vitro experiments the marked downregulation of important cell-cycle inhibitors may accelerate progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. The relevance of our findings to in vivo conditions remains speculative, but the observed mechanisms of significantly reduced expression of cell-cycle inhibitor proteins may be involved in the carcinogenesis of head and neck malignancies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents 5.5% of malignancies worldwide, with approximately 30,000 new cases and approximately 11,000 deaths reported in the United States annually. The opioid growth factor (OGF; [Met(5)]-enkephalin) and the OGF receptor (OGFr) form an endogenous growth regulating system; the OGF-OGFr axis influences the G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle in HNSCC. Cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for OGFr no longer responded to the growth inhibitory effects of OGF or the growth stimulatory effects of naltrexone, indicating that these activities are entirely mediated by OGFr. In this investigation, we examined the precise target of OGF in the cell cycle. Using SCC-1 cells, OGF decreased the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. This change was correlated with reduced Cdk4, but not Cdk2, kinase activity. OGF treatment increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 protein expression. Importantly, p16 complexed with Cdk4 was increased by OGF treatment at all time points, consistent with the hypothesis that OGF mediated growth inhibition through p16. Blockade of OGF-OGFr interactions with naloxone abolished the increased expression of p16 protein by OGF. Inhibition of p16 (INK4a) activation by p16-specific siRNA blocked OGF's repressive action on proliferation of SCC-1, CAL-27, and SCC-4 HNSCC cells. These data are the first to reveal that the target of cell proliferative inhibitory action of OGF in human HNSCC is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory pathway, and this may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of HNSCC.",

Recent studies have demonstrated a link between human papillomavirus infection and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, especially from the oropharynx. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of p16 expression in squamous cell carcinomas of noncervical origin and to assess its utility as a surrogate marker of human papillomavirus infection in various noncervical primary sites. One hundred thirty-seven squamous cell carcinomas from 5 primary sites, including 34 from the oropharynx (tonsil and base of tongue), 43 cases from nonoropharyngeal head and neck sites, and 20 cases each from the lung, esophagus, and skin, were retrieved from our surgical pathology archives. Immunohistochemistry for p16 was performed on each case. All p16-positive cases and 21 p16-negative cases were further tested for both high-risk and low-risk human papillomavirus by in situ hybridization. p16 expression was detected in 54 cases overall, including 25 (74%) of 34 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, 8 (19%) of 43 nonoropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinomas including 3 of 4 from the sinonasal cavity, 6 (30%) of 20 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 7 (35%) of 20 lung squamous cell carcinomas, and 8 (40%) of 20 skin squamous cell carcinomas. Of the 54 p16-positive cases, 30 were positive for high-risk human papillomavirus, including 24 (96%) of 25 from the oropharynx, 5 (63%) of 8 from nonoropharyngeal head and neck sites, and 1 (17%) of 6 from the esophagus. All 7 lung and 8 skin cases tested were negative. All p16-positive cases were negative for low-risk human papillomavirus. In selected head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, mainly from the oropharynx and sinonasal cavity, p16 positivity correlates well with high-risk human papillomavirus infection. p16 is not a reliable indicator of high-risk human papillomavirus infection in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, skin, and esophagus.",

Furthermore, there was no correlation between LOH at 9p21-22 and the RB1 tumor suppressor gene. These findings indicate that in the set of tumors that we tested, LOH at 9p21-22 is common in primary HNSCC but that genetic alterations of p16INK4a located in this region are unusual.

This study analyzed the presence and genotype of high risk HPVs, viral DNA load and transcription of the E6/E7 mRNAs, in 231 consecutive HNSCC. Twelve out of 30 HPV16 DNA-positive tumors displayed high E6/E7 mRNAs levels and were localized in the oropharyngeal region. While HPV-free and non-transcriptionally active HPV-related patients showed similar 5-years survival rates, E6/E7 expression was associated with a better prognosis. This emphasizes the importance of considering the transcriptional status of HPV-positive tumors for patient stratification. A gene expression profiling analysis of these different types of tumors was carried out. The most significant differentially expressed gene was CDKN2A, a known biomarker for HPV-related cancer. Assessing both the expression level of the E6/E7 mRNAs and of CDKN2A in HNSCC is required to detect active HPV infection. Chromosomic alterations were investigated by Comparative Genomic Hybridation (CGH) analysis of tumors with transcriptionally active HPV and HPV-negative tumors. The loss of the chromosomal region 16q was found to be a major genetic event in HPV-positive lesions. A cluster of genes located in 16q21-24 displayed decreased expression levels, notably APP-BP1 that is involved in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of p53. In conclusion, this study highlights important criteria required to predict clinically active HPV infection, identifies new biological pathways implicated in HPV tumorigenesis and increases the understanding of HPV-HNSCC physiopathology that is required to develop new targets for therapy.",

The objective of this study was to discriminate the impact of combined HPV(+/-) and p16(+/-) status on survival. Data sources were identification and review of publications assessing survival of the distinct subgroups with both p16 and HPV investigated in HNSCC until February, 2015. A meta-analysis was performed to classify survival and clinical outcomes. 18 out of 397 articles (4424 patients) were eligible for the meta-analysis. The percent proportion of the subgroups was 25 % for HPV(+)/p16(+), 61.2 % for HPV(-)/p16(-), 7.1 % for HPV(-)/p16(+) and 6.8 % for HPV(+)/P16(-).

The 5-year OS of the HPV(-)/p16(+) subgroup was intermediate while HPV(+)/p16(-) and HPV(-)/p16(-) HNSCC had the shortest survival. With current therapeutic strategies, survival of patients with HNSCC is better if associated with HPV(+)/p16(+) or HPV(-)/p16(+). Clinical trials are needed to confirm the distinct survival pattern and to investigate possible differences in survival for HPV(+)/p16(-) and HPV(-)/p16(+) HNSCC.

Current techniques for the clinical diagnosis of HPV-associated HNSCC will also be discussed, that is, the detection of HPV DNA, RNA, and the HPV surrogate marker, p16 in tumor tissues, as well as HPV-specific antibodies in serum. Such methods do not allow for the early detection of HPV-associated HNSCC and most cases are at an advanced stage upon diagnosis. Novel noninvasive approaches using oral fluid, a clinically relevant biological fluid, allow for the detection of HPV and cellular alterations in infected cells, which may aid in the early detection and HPV-typing of HNSCC tumors. Noninvasive diagnostic methods will enable early detection and intervention, leading to a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity associated with HNSCC. ",

We found that the desmosomal proteins exhibit a distinct expression pattern in oral mucosa when compared with epidermis in vivo. Microarray data from a large panel of lines revealed that the transcript levels of DSG3, DSC2/3, DP, PG and PKP1 were reduced in ID and IC. Interestingly, DSG2 was up-regulated in MC. Reduction of DSG3 and up-regulation of DSG2 were found in two independent microarray datasets. Significantly, we demonstrated that reduction of DSG3 and up-regulation of DSG2 was reversible in vitro by using RNAi-mediated knockdown of DSG2 in IC cells. The remaining desmosomal proteins were largely disrupted or internalized and associated with retraction of keratin intermediate filaments in oral SCC lines. These findings suggest dysfunction and loss of desmosomal components are common events in the immortal class of oral SCC and that these events may precede overt malignancy.",

Although the causal link between high-risk HPVs and cervical carcinoma is well established, the implication of this viral infection in HNSCC remains debatable. Here, we discuss current knowledge concerning the HPV implication in HNSCCs. Based on our literature review, 20 to 25% of HNSCCs could be associated with oncogenic HPVs, in particular HPV type 16. The oropharynx--more precisely the tonsil--is the head and neck location presenting the highest incidence of HPV infection. Moreover, a clear increase of tonsillar carcinoma incidence has been described. As observed in cervical carcinomas, HPV positive HNSCCs are sexually transmitted and characterized by alterations of p53 and pRb signalling pathways.

Knowledge of the HPV status of metastatic HNSCC has significant treatment and prognostic implications as HPV-associated tumors have a more favorable prognosis than conventional HNSCC. Accordingly, HPV testing should be performed on any squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary identified in neck lymph nodes.

Molecular analyses of the p16 gene locus in blood and tumor DNA from this family was performed to determine whether an association between germline p16 gene mutation and HNSCC exists.;Molecular pedigree analyses.;Exon 2 of p16 was polymerase chain reaction amplified from blood, tumor, or nontumor DNA isolated from affected and unaffected members, then directly sequenced and compared with consensus p16 sequence. Cell cycle position of cells expressing wild-type or mutant p16 was determined by flow cytometry.;Molecular analyses revealed a nonfunctional germline point mutation within exon 2 of the p16 gene that encodes a mutant p16 protein substituting proline at amino acid position 87 for the wild-type arginine (p16R87P). Relative to wild-type p16, p16R87P lost ability to cause a growth arrest following ectopic expression. The mutant (p16R87P) allele segregated with cancer predisposition in tested family members, and analyses of HNSCC tumor tissues demonstrated universal loss of wild-type allele.;Significance of the mutant p16 (p16R87P) in HNSCC tumorigenesis is strongly suggested by its loss of cell cycle arrest activity and its retention in tumor tissue with simultaneous loss of the wild-type allele. Further, the germline p16 mutation segregated with cancer predisposition within the family.

Methylation of the promotor region and LOH were the main mechanisms of p16 inactivation encountered in this study. Point mutations presented as rare events. The methylation of the promotor region appeared frequently parallel with an LOH. An inactivation of p16 did not have any statistical influence on the tumor dependent survival, the lymphatic spread, the number and time delay of local and regional recurrences. Patients with an inactivated p16 gene by promotor methylation appeared to have a slightly lower tendency for local and regional recurrences.;The inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p16 plays a role in the carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, the pharynx and the larynx.

HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have distinct risk profiles and appreciate a prognostic advantage compared to HPV-negative HNSCC. Promoter hypermethylation is widely recognized as a mechanism in the progression of HNSCC, but the extent to which this mechanism is consistent between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors is unknown. To investigate the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in HPV-induced and carcinogen-induced cancers, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in HPV(+) and HPV(-) SCC cell lines. We used two platforms: the Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadArray and tiling arrays, and confirmed illustrative examples with pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR. These analyses indicate that HPV(+) cell lines have higher DNA methylation in genic and LINE-1 regions than HPV(-) cell lines. Differentially methylated loci between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines significantly correlated with HPV-typed HNSCC primary tumor DNA methylation levels. Novel findings include higher promoter methylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes in HPV(+) cells compared to HPV(-) cells and increased expression of DNMT3A in HPV(+) cells. Additionally, CDKN2A and KRT8 were identified as interaction hubs among genes with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(-) cells. Conversely, RUNX2, IRS-1 and CCNA1 were major hubs with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(+) cells. Distinct HPV(+) and HPV(-) epigenetic profiles should provide clues to novel targets for development of individualized therapeutic strategies.",

Therefore, early diagnosis of high-risk premalignant lesions and incipient cancers is important. HNSCC is currently perceived as a single progression mechanism, resulting in immortal invasive cancers. However, we have found that approximately 40% of primary oral SCCs are mortal in culture, and these have a better prognosis. About 60% of oral premalignancies (dysplasias) are also mortal. The mortal and immortal tumors are generated in vivo as judged by p53 mutations and loss of p16(INK4A) expression being found only in the original tumors from which the immortal cultures were derived. To investigate the relationships of dysplasias to SCCs, we did microarray analysis of primary cultures of 4 normal oral mucosa biopsies, 19 dysplasias, and 16 SCCs. Spectral clustering using the singular value decomposition and other bioinformatic techniques showed that development of mortal and immortal SCCs involves distinct transcriptional changes. Both SCC classes share most of the transcriptional changes found in their respective dysplasias but have additional changes. Moreover, high-risk dysplasias that subsequently progress to SCCs more closely resemble SCCs than nonprogressing dysplasias. This indicates for the first time that there are divergent mortal and immortal pathways for oral SCC development via intermediate dysplasias. We believe that this new information may lead to new ways of classifying HNSCC in relation to prognosis.",

In contrast to reports that suggest an inverse relationship between smoking and global DNA CpG methylation, hypermethylation of promoters of a number of genes was detected in saliva collected from patients with HNSCC. Using a sensitive methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) assay to determine specific methylation events in the promoters of RASSF1A, DAPK1, and p16 genes, we demonstrate that we can detect tumor presence with an overall accuracy of 81% in the DNA isolated from saliva of patients with HNSCC (n = 143) when compared with the DNA isolated from the saliva of healthy nonsmoker controls (n = 31). The specificity for this MSP panel was 87% and the sensitivity was 80% (with a Fisher exact test P < .0001). In addition, the test panel performed extremely well in the detection of the early stages of HNSCCs, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 87%, and a high κ concordance value of 0.8, indicating an excellent overall agreement between the presence of HNSCC and a positive MSP panel result.

Treatment is dictated by the subsequent determination of primary tumor site and stage. However, the primary site remains elusive in some patients even after an exhaustive examination. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is an important etiologic agent for HNSCCs that arise within the oropharynx but less so for tumors from nonoropharyngeal sites. Detection of HPV-16 or a surrogate marker may be useful in localizing tumor origin in patients who present with metastatic HNSCC.;We performed in situ hybridization (ISH) for HPV-16 on lymph node metastases from 68 patients with HNSCC. P16 immunohistochemistry was also performed because HPV-16 integration disrupts the retinoblastoma pathway and induces an overexpression of p16.;HPV-16 was detected in 22 of the 68 (32%) cases by ISH. When stratified by site of origin, HPV-16 was detected in 22 of 31 (71%) metastases from the oropharynx, but in none of the 37 (0%) metastases from other sites (P < 0.001; Fisher's exact). P16 expression was associated with the presence of HPV-16 by ISH: 21 of 22 HPV-16 positive tumors exhibited p16 expression, whereas only 4 of the 46 HPV-16-negative tumors were p16 positive (95% versus 9%; P < 0.001; Fisher's exact). P16 expression in the node metastases also correlated with site of tumor origin: 24 of 31 oropharyngeal tumors were p16 positive, whereas only 1 of 37 nonoropharyngeal tumors was p16 positive (77% versus 3%; P < 0.001; Fisher's exact).;For patients with metastatic HNSCC, detection of HPV-16 is a reliable way to establish origin from the oropharynx, either directly by ISH or indirectly by immunohistochemistry for p16 overexpression.",

By analyzing 78 HNSCC we sought to validate the accuracy of p16(INK4A) as a reliable marker of active HPV infections in HNSCC. To this end we determined HPV DNA (HPVD) and E6*I mRNA (HPVR) expression status and correlated these results with p16(INK4A) staining. In tonsillar SCC 12/20 were HPVD+ and 12/12 of these showed active HPV infections whereas in non-tonsillar SCC 10/58 were HPVD+ and 5/10 showed active HPV infections. Thus, we prove about 8% of non-tonsillar SCC to be also correlated with HPV-associated carcinogenesis. Strikingly, 3/14 (21.4%) of tonsillar and non-tonsillar HPVD+/HPVR+ cases did not show p16(INK4A) overexpression and these cases would have been missed when applying initial p16(INK4A) staining only. However, in 13 cases negative for HPV, DNA p16(INK4A) was overexpressed. In conclusion, our data confirm tonsillar SCC to be predominantly but not only associated with active HPV infections. Furthermore, our data show that p16(INK4A) overexpression is not evident in a subgroup of HNSCC with active HPV infection. Definitive HPV data should therefore be utilized in diagnostics and treatment modalities of HPV positive and HPV negative HNSCC patients, resulting in a paradigm shift regarding these obviously different tumor entities.",

The prescribed radiotherapy (RT) dose was 66-68 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, 6 F/W. The hypoxic radiosensitiser nimorazole was given orally at a dose of 1200 mg/m(2) before each fraction. Concomitant cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)) i.v. was given once a week for a maximum of six cycles. Outcome data were evaluated in terms of loco-regional tumour control (LRC), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Morbidity data were evaluated based on the DAHANCA routine registration. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-status was estimated by immunohistochemical staining of p16.;Included were 178 (78%) men and 49 (22%) women with a median age of 57 years. All except five patients received RT as prescribed. At least five series of cisplatin was given to 164 (72%) of the patients, and 149 patients (66%) received the full dose of nimorazole. The five-year actuarial LRC, EFS and OS rates were 80%, 67% and 72%, respectively. The LRC rates according to site were: oropharynx: 88%, larynx: 77%, hypopharynx 72% and oral cavity 49%, respectively. HPV/p16 staining was obtained in 141 of the 150 oropharyngeal cancers. Of these, 112 (79%) were p16 pos and 29 (21%) were p16 neg. LRC for the p16 neg oropharyngeal cancers was poorer than for the p16 pos (74% vs. 91%; p = 0.02). Tube feeding during treatment was necessary for 146 (64%) patients. At 12 months this number was reduced to 6%.;The treatment was tolerable in this cohort of locally advanced HNSCC patients. Acute and late toxicity was comparable to similar studies of chemoradiotherapy, and the outcome superior to the data reported in the literature. This strongly indicates that RT of advanced head and neck cancer must include as well hypoxic modification, accelerated fractionation as chemoradiotherapy to yield optimal outcome.",

We aimed to find a detection algorithm of a biologically and thus clinically meaningful infection, applicable for high-throughput screening of frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens. By considering detection of HPV E6 oncogene expression in frozen biopsies as gold standard for a meaningful HPV infection, the value of several assays was evaluated on FFPE tumor specimens and sera of 48 HNSCC patients. The following assays were evaluated on FFPE tissue samples: HPV DNA general primer (GP)5+/6+ PCR, viral load analysis, HPV16 DNA FISH detection, HPV16 E6 mRNA RT-PCR, p16 immunostaining, and on corresponding serum samples detection of antibodies against the HPV16 proteins L1, E6 and E7. Comparing single assays on FFPE tissue samples detection of E6 expression by RT-PCR was superior, but application remains at present limited to HPV16 detection. Most suitable algorithm with 100% sensitivity and specificity appeared p16 immunostaining followed by GP5+/6+ PCR on the p16-positive cases. We show that clinically meaningful viral HPV infections can be more reliably measured in FFPE HNSCC samples in a standard and high throughput manner, paving the way for prognostic and experimental vaccination studies, regarding not only HNSCC, but possibly also cancer types with HPV involvement in subgroups such as penile and anal cancer.",

We examined the causative effect of HPV16 E6 and E7 expression on the immortalization of normal oral keratinocytes (OKCs) and compared the resulting phenotype with alternative ways of p53- and pRb-pathway abrogation frequently found in HNSCCs without HPV. Primary OKCs were conditionally immortalized with temperature-sensitive SV40 large T-antigen and human telomerase, allowing these cells to return to their senescent primary state after temperature shift. HPV16 E6 and E7 were introduced to overcome senescence, determined with population doubling (PD) as read-out. For comparison, we downregulated p53 and p16 by short hairpin RNA genes and expressed mutant p53R(175)H and cyclinD1. Expression of HPV16 E6 caused an extended life span similar to expression of mutant p53R(175)H or p53 knockdown. Expression of mutant p53R(175)H seemed to cause additional activation of the hypoxia and WNT signaling pathways. HPV16 E7 expression had no direct effect on lifespan, similar to p16 knockdown or cyclinD1 expression. In combination with HPV16 E6 or other functional inactivations of p53, abrogation of the pRb-pathway by either HPV16 E7 or other manipulations caused an immortal phenotype. Our data show the causative role of HPV16 E6/E7 in early squamous carcinogenesis. Activity of each gene could be mimicked by other genetic events frequently found in HNSCC without HPV.

Furthermore, recent studies in cancer have suggested the importance of identifying transcriptionally altered loci as biomarkers for improved prognosis and therapy. While many statistical methods have been proposed for identifying novel transcriptional events with RNA-seq, nearly all rely on contrasting known classes of samples, such as tumor and normal. Few tools exist for the unsupervised discovery of such events without class labels. In this paper, we present SigFuge for identifying genomic loci exhibiting differential transcription patterns across many RNA-seq samples. SigFuge combines clustering with hypothesis testing to identify genes exhibiting alternative splicing, or differences in isoform expression. We apply SigFuge to RNA-seq cohorts of 177 lung and 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and identify several cases of differential isoform usage including CDKN2A, a tumor suppressor gene known to be inactivated in a majority of lung squamous cell tumors. By not restricting attention to known sample stratifications, SigFuge offers a novel approach to unsupervised screening of genetic loci across RNA-seq cohorts.

Researches are focused on the development of HPV detection assays specially designed for HNSCC. The HPV diagnosis in these tumours is relevant toprognosis even in an already-developed tumour, whereas in the cervix, where the HPV is the cause of almost all tumours, this information has less clinical relevance. The better outcome of HPV-associated HNSCC raises the question about the best methodologies to distinguish between HPV and non-HPV-associated SCC. However, no consensus has been reached on the optimal way to identify HPV-associated SCC and ancillary studies have utilised many different methodologies, including HPV polymerase chain reaction testing, HPV in situ hybridization analysis, immunohistochemical staining for p16, and newer techniques that are currently under investigation. The objective of this review is to explain and give examples of various techniques of HPV detection highlighting how they might be used clinically. Although currently insufficiently specific due to the possibility of HPV infection originating at other sites, methodologies utilising serum and plasma to measure HPV infection will also be described, mostly for their potential future development and use. Finally, DNA/RNA microarray platforms will be briefly summarized for their capacity to identify the profile of molecular changes in any particular HPV+/HPV- cancer. In this way, it is expected to be possible to correlate the appropriate transcriptome-based diagnosis to the patients' specific cancer risk.",

Therefore, predictive biomarkers for this disease would be valuable to provide more effective and individualized therapeutic approaches for these patients. While prognostic biomarkers such as p16 expression correlate with outcome; to date, no predictive biomarkers have been clinically validated for HNSCC. We generated xenografts in immunocompromised mice from six established HNSCC cell lines and evaluated response to cisplatin, cetuximab, and radiation. Tissue microarrays were constructed from pre- and posttreatment tumor samples derived from each xenograft experiment. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed using a semiautomated imaging and analysis platform to determine the relative expression of five potential predictive biomarkers: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phospho-EGFR, phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK, and excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1). Biomarker levels were compared between xenografts that were sensitive versus resistant to a specific therapy utilizing a two-sample t-test with equal standard deviations. Indeed the xenografts displayed heterogeneous responses to each treatment, and we linked a number of baseline biomarker levels to response. This included low ERCC1 being associated with cisplatin sensitivity, low phospho-Akt correlated with cetuximab sensitivity, and high total EGFR was related to radiation resistance. Overall, we developed a systematic approach to identifying predictive biomarkers and demonstrated several connections between biomarker levels and treatment response. Despite these promising initial results, this work requires additional preclinical validation, likely involving the use of patient-derived xenografts, prior to moving into the clinical realm for confirmation among patients with HNSCC.

Cases of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to the brain were identified from a computerized search of the surgical pathology files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1985 and 2012. The medical records were reviewed to document primary site of tumor origin, treatment, and patient outcome. P16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridization were performed on those metastases arising from the head and neck. Of the 38 metastatic SCCs, 7 (18 %) originated in the head and neck. HPV-16 was detected in 4 (57 %) of the metastatic HNSCCs. All 4 HPV-positive metastases were from oropharyngeal primaries. The time from treatment of the primary to development of the brain metastasis ranged from 19 to 57 months (mean, 45). Following aggressive treatment (surgery and radiation), two patients died of disease progression (7 and 34 months), and two are alive with recurrent brain metastases (4 and 10 months). Although HPV positivity is regarded as a favorable prognostic indicator, it does not safeguard from spread to the brain. In our experience, just over half of the HNSCCs that metastasized to the brain were HPV-related. The potential for developing a brain metastasis long after curative therapy argues for extended patient follow-up.

For retrospective analysis, all clinico-pathological data including disease-free survival (DFS), local progression-free survival (LPFS), and overall survival (OS) were compiled. Additionally, we assessed the mutational status of the TP53 gene and the prevalence of HPV serotypes by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect p16INK4A expression levels as surrogate marker for HPV infection. The prevalence rate of BM in our cohort comprising 193 patients with advanced HNSCC was 5.7%. Of 11 patients with BM, 3 were female and 9 were male. Seven of the primary tumors were of oropharyngeal origin (OPSCC). LPFS of the cohort was 11.8 months, DFS was 12.1 months and OS was 36.0 months. After the diagnosis of BM, survival was 10.5 months. Five tumors showed a mutation in the TP53 gene, while five of the seven OPSCC tumors had a positive HPV status displaying infection with serotype 16 in all cases. Compared with patients who harbored TP53wt/HPV-positive tumors, patients with TP53 mutations showed a poor prognosis. Compared with the whole cohort, the interval between diagnosis of the primary and the detection of BM was prolonged in the HPV-infected OPSCC subgroup (26.4 vs. 45.6 months). The prognosis of HNSCC patients with BM is poor. In our cohort, most tumors were OPSCC with the majority being HPV positive. Our study points toward a putatively unusual metastatic behavior of HPV-positive OPSCC.",

We aim to explore the frequency of HPV and its major genotypes in North Indian patients and their association with clinicopathological and histopathological features and p16 expression pattern.;The study group comprised 250 histologically proven cases of OSCC. HPV was detected by real time PCR in tumor biopsy specimens and confirmed by conventional PCR with PGMY09/ PGMY11 primers. Genotyping for high-risk types 16/ 18 was conducted by type specific PCR. p16 expression was assessed by immunohistochemsitry.;HPV presence was confirmed in 23/250 (9.2%) OSCC cases, of which 30.4% had HPV 16 infection, 17.4%were positive for HPV 18 and 26.1% had co-infections. HPV presence was significantly associated with male gender (p=0.02) and habit of pan masala chewing (p=0.01). HPV positive cases also had a history of tobacco consumption in 91.3% cases. p16 over expression was observed in 39.1% of HPV positive cases but this was not significantly different from negative cases (p=0.54).;The frequency of HPV in OSCC is low in North-India and majority of cases are associated with a tobacco habit. It appears that tobacco shows a confounding effect in HPV positive cases and use of p16 protein as a reliable marker to assess the potential etiological role of HPV in OSCC in our population is not suggested.",

This study evaluates whether E6/E7 mRNA in situ hybridization (RISH) can detect transcriptionally active HPV in these problematic cases.;Eighty-two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases that had previously undergone p16 IHC and HPV DISH were evaluated with two RISH platforms and a second-generation DISH probe. The study included 21 p16+/DISH+ concordant cases, 19 p16-/DISH- concordant cases, and 42 p16+/DISH- discordant cases.;RISH identified E6/E7 mRNA in 37 (88%) p16+/DISH- cases, 21 (100%) p16+/DISH+ cases, and 0 (0%) p16-/DISH- cases. RISH signals were clearly visible at low to medium magnification in 97% of positive cases, facilitating almost-perfect inter-observer reproducibility. The performance of the manual and automated RISH platforms were equivalent (kappa=0.915). Only 29% of carcinomas that demonstrated E6/E7 mRNA transcriptional activity were positive using the 2nd generation DISH probe.;HPV RISH is a highly sensitive and specific platform that can clarify the HPV status of those perplexing OPSCCs that are p16 positive by IHC but HPV negative by DISH. Moreover, it is easy to interpret, readily adaptable to the clinical laboratory, and provides direct evidence of HPV transcriptional activity. E6/E7 RISH should be considered as a first-line platform for determination of HPV status in OPSCCs.",

Expression profiles of cytokeratins, 5/6; 8/18; 10; 13; 14; and 19, p16, and pRb were evaluated in 101 consecutive patients with cervical nodal metastasis who had undergone neck dissection to treat known head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (primary sites: 16, oral cavity; 38, oropharynx; 26, hypopharynx; 21, larynx). Cytokeratin 10 was more frequently expressed in oral cavity primary tumors, whereas cytokeratin 19 staining was more frequently observed in tumors originated from the pharynx and larynx. The expression of p16 and altered pRb status (0% or >50%) were more frequently observed in oropharynx primary tumors. To select the best subset among the 8 antibodies tested, classification and regression tree analysis was performed. The analysis correctly classified the four primary sites (25.0% of oral cavity, 89.5% of oropharynx, 30.8% of hypopharynx, and 57.1% of larynx) using 5 variables (histologic subtype, p16, cytokeratins 10 and 19, and pRb).

The methylation status and histological features of the specimens were investigated.;In histologically normal squamous mucosa, no to low-level methylation (0-22%) was noted in some specimens at all genes except RARbeta2 (50%). Considerable variation in the incidence of methylation of these genes within and between cell lines and tumor specimens was noted. The highest incidences of methylation in the cell lines and primary tumors were noted in RARbeta2 (53%), MGMT (37%), p16 (33%), and DAP-K (25%); low incidence of methylations were noted in E-cadherin (2%), p73 (2%) RASSF1A (10%), and p14 (20%) genes. The incidences of methylation of each gene were almost similar between the HNSC cell lines and primary cancer specimens, although methylation of RASSF1A was observed in cell line (26%), but not in dysplasia and primary tumor. RARbeta, p16, and MGMT genes showed the highest incidences of methylation in premalignant and invasive carcinomas.;Methylation of p16, RARbeta, and MGMT may constitute early events in HNSC tumorigenesis.

Association of HPV in oral cancers has not been explored in north-east India.;Thirty-one patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) on treatment from October 2010 to January 2013 were included in the study. Patients who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. HPV 16/18 DNA was evaluated using Chromogenic in-situ Hybridization (CISH). Presence of nuclear signals was taken as positive HPV expression. p16 was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and was considered positive if ≥ 80% of the tumour cells showed strong and diffuse nuclear/cytoplasmic immunostaining. The results were analysed using Fisher exact test and confidence interval was calculated where required.;The study group age ranged from 30 to 80 years (median age- 54.2 years). The most common site was gum, with well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma being the most common histology. HPV 16/18 DNA was positive in 29% (95% CI: 13.03% - 44.97%) cases and had a clear tendency towards statistical significance with non-smoker cases (p=0.05), lymph node metastasis (p=0.05) and a significant correlation with p16 overexpression (p=0.04). There was no significant correlation with other clinico-pathological parameters.;HPV 16/18 is associated with OSCC, commonly seen among non-smokers and may be related to nodal metastasis.

In the German series, 52/424 cases (12.3 %) were p16-positive/hrHPV-positive (OSCC 3.8 % [10/265], OPSCC 34.4 % [42/122], HPSCC 0 % [0/37]). In addition, there were 9 cases that were p16-positive/hrHPV-negative (5 OPSCC and 4 OSCC). In the Brazilian series, the overall hrHPV DNA prevalence by PCR was 11.0 % ([18/163]; OSCC 6 % [5/83], OPSCC 15.5 % [11/71], HPSCC 22.2 % [2/9]). Ten of these cases were hrHPV-positive/p16-positive. The remaining 8 hrHPV-positive/p16-negative cases were also negative in both ISH assays. Furthermore, 5 p16-positive/hrHPV-negative cases (2 OPSCC and 3 OSCC) were identified. In both series, HPV16 was by far the most common HPV type detected. We confirm that regardless of geographical origin, the highest hrHPV prevalence in HNSCC is observed in oropharyngeal carcinomas. The proportion of HPV-associated OPSCC was substantially higher in the German cohort than in the Brazilian series (34.4 vs. 15.5 %), and in both groups, the prevalence of hrHPV in OPSCC was much lower than in recent reports from North America and Scandinavia.

The prognostic significance of these molecular events at different sites within the head and neck, however, remains controversial. Thus, we sought to determine the relationship between cyclin D1 and/or p16INK4A expression and disease outcome in squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue. Immunohistochemical detection of nuclear proteins cyclin D1, p53, and p16INK4A, and the Ki-67 labeling index was undertaken in tissue sections from 148 tongue cancers treated by surgical resection. Nuclear antigen status was analyzed in relation to pathological variables, tumor recurrence, and patient survival. Statistical significance was assessed using chi2 analysis for pathological variables and the Kaplan-Meier method, log rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards model for survival parameters. Overexpression of cyclin D1 occurred in 68% of tumors (100 of 147) and was associated with increased lymph node stage (P = 0.014), increased tumor grade (P = 0.003), and reduced disease-free (P = 0.006) and overall (P = 0.01) survival. Loss of p16INK4A expression was demonstrated in 55% of tumors (78 of 143) and was associated with reduced disease-free (P = 0.007) and overall (P = 0.014) survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that in addition to pathological stage and regional lymph node status, cyclin D1 overexpression and loss of p16INK4A expression are independent predictors of death from tongue cancer. Loss of p16INK4A in the presence of cyclin D1 overexpression conferred a significantly worse disease-free (P = 0.011) and overall (P = 0.002) survival at 5 years. p53 nuclear accumulation and the Ki-67 labeling index were not prognostic. These data indicate that cyclin D1 overexpression and loss of p16INK4A expression predict early relapse and reduced survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue. Simultaneous assessment of cyclin D1 and p16INK4A protein levels define subgroups of patients at increased risk of relapse and may be of clinical utility in optimizing therapy.",

Sensitivity and specificity for high-risk HPV and correlation with overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and time to distant metastasis (TDM) were calculated for ProExC and p16 at different thresholds. ProExC did not prove to be a robust marker. It showed strong correlation with OS at a 66% threshold on TMA cores, but correlation with OS was lost on whole sections. It also exhibited low sensitivity (53.7%) on TMA cores and low specificity on whole sections (65%). ProExC at a 33% threshold exhibited unacceptably low specificity and did not correlate with OS, CSS, or TDM. Sensitivity and specificity of p16 varied predictably with threshold: higher sensitivity and lower specificity with lower thresholds and vice versa for higher thresholds. p16 at a 50% threshold offers a balance between sensitivity and specificity, and correlates with OS, CSS, and TDM on whole sections; correlation with TDM is lost on TMA cores.

Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and sorafenib and sunitinib, multityrosine kinase inhibitors, have been notably effective in the therapy of different tumor entities. The modest side-effects and oral application of the drugs might improve patient compliance. Expression levels of mTOR and Amphiregulin (AREG) in p16-positive and -negative SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) and the effect of everolimus, sorafenib or sunitinib on the expression levels of these target proteins were assessed. As far as we are aware of, this is one of the first in vitro studies to evaluate the effect of these small-molecule drugs with regard to the p16 status of SCC cells.;p16-negative HNSCC 11A and 14C cells and p16-positive CERV196 cells were exposed to different concentrations of everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib for 2-8 days. Expression levels of mTOR and AREG were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared against a chemonaïve control.;AREG and mTOR were expressed in all tested cell lines. CERV196 displayed a remarkable increase of mTOR expression compared to p16-negative HNSCC. On the contrary, AREG levels were reduced by 50% in CERV196. Everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib significantly reduced mTOR expression. Everolimus significantly decreased AREG expression independently of the HPV status. Sunitinib and sorafenib increased AREG expression in HNSCC 11A and 14C but not in CERV196.;The applied drugs showed remarkable suppression of mTOR expression, which might delay tumor progression. Interestingly, sorafenib and sunitinib increased AREG in HNSCC 11A and 14C, which could be a possible evasive mechanism following incubation with these drugs. On the contrary, p16-positive CERV196 showed increased susceptibility to sorafenib and sunitinib concerning suppression of AREG expression. Further studies are required to evaluate the HPV-dependent differences of therapy response and the possible consequences for treatment options.",

Previously, we have documented the in vivo inactivation of p16INK4A, an inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases, in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region. In the present study, we extend these findings by examining the expression and functional activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory subunits using a model system of cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinomas. Increased activity of CDK4 and 6 was universal in tumor cells compared with normal keratinocytes, reflecting over-expression of either or both kinases. In contrast to other studies, over-expression of cyclin D1, a regulatory subunit of CDK4 and 6, was not observed. Increased activity of CDK2 was less frequent and was related to over-expression of cyclin A and/or E. All tumor cell lines showed increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen compared to normal keratinocytes. Four SCC cell lines, including one tumor-metastasis pair derived from a single patient, failed to express the p15INK4B transcript. Western blot analysis of cell lysates revealed normal or reduced levels of p27KIP1 in tumor cells compared to normal keratinocytes. However, failure to express wild-type p53 was not reflected by lower levels of p21WAF1. Our data suggest that cell-cycle deregulation is likely to occur by multiple mechanisms during the genesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Furthermore, p16INK4A is likely to be the primary target for inactivation on chromosome 9p21 in these tumors as p15INK4B loss occurs less frequently.",

Demographic and clinicopathologic information and overall survival were extracted from medical records.;We identified 150 patients with the diagnosis of HNSCC. Sixty-nine patients had HPV-positive tumors (46%), and 65 (43%) had HPV-negative tumors (16 did not have HPV testing). Age at diagnosis ranged from 44 to 94 years (mean, 64.6 [SD, 8.0] years), and median (interquartile range) follow-up was 16.7 (8.7-27.3) years. Tumor location differed significantly between the 2 groups, with an HPV-positive predominance in the oropharynx (43 of 57 [75%]; P < .001).

To investigate the role of Trop2 in epithelial carcinogenesis, we generated Trop2(-/-) mice, which are viable and possess a normal lifespan. Contrary to expectations, Trop2 loss fails to suppress keratinocyte transformation. Instead, ras-transformed Trop2(-/-) keratinocytes preferentially pass through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and form tumors with spindle cell histology. Furthermore, Trop2 loss renders Arf-null mice susceptible to the formation of biphasic sarcomatoid carcinomas containing both squamous and spindle cell components upon carcinogen exposure in an otherwise skin cancer-resistant strain (C57BL/6). Immortalized keratinocytes derived from Trop2(-/-)Arf(-/-) mice exhibit enhanced proliferative and migratory capacity as well as increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Src prior to transformation. The clinical relevance of these findings was supported by studying the molecular epidemiology of Trop2 in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. This analysis revealed that Trop2 mRNA levels are decreased in a subset of tumors with features of EMT, and total loss of Trop2 protein expression is observed in the spindle cell component of sarcomatoid carcinomas. Therefore, while previous studies have emphasized the potential importance of Trop2 gain of function, these results uncover a role for Trop2 loss in tumorigenesis and the mesenchymal transdifferentiation observed in a subset of squamous cell carcinomas.",

The expression and subcellular localization of β-catenin and EGFR activation were also studied in HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines with western blot analysis. HPV16 E6 small interfering RNA was used to elucidate the effect of the HPV oncoprotein on β-catenin translocation. The involvement of EGFR in β-catenin translocation was confirmed by treatment with erlotinib. Moreover, the invasive capacity was evaluated after HPV16 E6/E7 repression.;The results showed that the membrane weighted index of β-catenin was inversely correlated with p16 positivity (P < .001) and lymph node metastasis (P = .026), whereas nuclear staining of β-catenin was associated with p16-positive OPSCC (P < .001). A low level of membrane β-catenin expression was significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival (P < .0001 in both cases). Furthermore, the membrane weighted index of EGFR was inversely correlated with p16 positivity (P < .001) and positively correlated with membrane β-catenin (P < .001). The in vitro study showed that HPV16 E6 repression led to reductions of phospho-EGFR and nuclear β-catenin, which were also observed after erlotinib treatment, and inhibition of invasion.;The findings suggest that HPV16 E6 mediates the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, which may be regulated by activated EGFR.",

Approximately 70% of global oesophageal cancer cases occur in China, with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being the histopathological form in the vast majority of cases (>90%). Currently, there are limited clinical approaches for the early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC, resulting in a 10% five-year survival rate for patients. However, the full repertoire of genomic events leading to the pathogenesis of ESCC remains unclear. Here we describe a comprehensive genomic analysis of 158 ESCC cases, as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium research project. We conducted whole-genome sequencing in 17 ESCC cases and whole-exome sequencing in 71 cases, of which 53 cases, plus an additional 70 ESCC cases not used in the whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, were subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. We identified eight significantly mutated genes, of which six are well known tumour-associated genes (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, NOTCH1, NFE2L2), and two have not previously been described in ESCC (ADAM29 and FAM135B). Notably, FAM135B is identified as a novel cancer-implicated gene as assayed for its ability to promote malignancy of ESCC cells. Additionally, MIR548K, a microRNA encoded in the amplified 11q13.3-13.4 region, is characterized as a novel oncogene, and functional assays demonstrate that MIR548K enhances malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells. Moreover, we have found that several important histone regulator genes (MLL2 (also called KMT2D), ASH1L, MLL3 (KMT2C), SETD1B, CREBBP and EP300) are frequently altered in ESCC. Pathway assessment reveals that somatic aberrations are mainly involved in the Wnt, cell cycle and Notch pathways. Genomic analyses suggest that ESCC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma share some common pathogenic mechanisms, and ESCC development is associated with alcohol drinking. This study has explored novel biological markers and tumorigenic pathways that would greatly improve therapeutic strategies for ESCC. ",

HR-HPV status was determined on the basis of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p16 expression and chromogenic in-situ hybridization (CISH) for HR-HPV. All cases were genotyped with a multiplexed mass spectrometry assay interrogating 91 hotspot mutations in eight cancer-related genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, MEK1 and ERBB2), and studied by fluorescence in-situ hybridization for PTEN copy number alteration. Three of eight cases (37.5%) were positive for the presence of HR-HPV by CISH and p16 IHC. One of three (33%) HR-HPV-positive cases harboured a PTEN hemizygous deletion, and one (33%) HR-HPV-positive case harboured a PIK3CA E545K somatic mutation. No alteration of the PTEN-PI3K pathway was detected in HR-HPV-negative tumours. Over a median follow-up period of 66.2 months, only the patient with the HR-HPV-positive PIK3CA-mutated tumour died of his disease, the remaining seven patients being disease-free.;Given the established aetiological role of HR-HPV in other head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, it is likely that HR-HPV represents an oncogenic driver in the pathogenesis of more than one-third of ParSCCs.

In a subset of cases, we have searched for integrated viral DNA, and have determined the genomic status of the E6 gene. Expression of E6/E7 was found in 12 tumours most of which were derived from the oropharynx, whereas p53 mutations were present in 13 tumours from various sites. The tumours either carried p53 mutations but did not express E6/E7, or they did express E6/E7 but were p53-wild-type. Coexistence of E6/E7 expression with a mutated p53 was found in only one case. Strikingly, in most p53-mutated tumours without E6/E7 expression, we found the E6 gene to be disrupted. E6/E7 expression was associated with reduced pRb and overexpressed p16(INK4a). Viral-cellular fusion transcripts were found in two cases. Our data demonstrate that HPV16 DNA-positivity in head and neck cancers is not indicative of a causal role.

HPV-positive HNSCC preferentially affect the oropharynx and tonsils. Localized HPV-positive HNSCCs have a favorable prognosis and treatment outcome. However, the impact of HPV in advanced or metastatic HNSCC remains to be defined. In particular, it is unclear whether HPV modulates the response to cetuximab, an antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a mainstay of treatment of advanced HNSCC. To this end, we have examined the sensitivity of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC models to cetuximab and cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have stably expressed the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 in cetuximab-sensitive cancer cell lines to specifically investigate their role in the antibody response. The endogenous HPV status or the expression of HPV oncogenes had no significant impact on cetuximab-mediated suppression of EGFR signaling and proliferation in vitro. Cetuximab effectively inhibited the growth of E6- and E7-expressing tumors grafted in NOD/SCID mice. In support, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from cetuximab-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC were probed for p16(INK4a) expression, an established biomarker of HPV infection. Response rates (45.5% versus 45.5%) and median progression-free survival (97 versus 92 days) following cetuximab-based therapy were similar in patients with p16(INK4A)-positive and p16(INK4A)-negative tumors. In conclusion, HPV oncogenes do not modulate the anti-EGFR antibody response in HSNCC. Cetuximab treatment should be administered independently of HPV status. ",

Herein, we investigated the association of HPV with aberrant methylation in tumor-related genes/loci consisting of the classical CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) panel markers (p16, MLH1, MINT1, MINT2, and MINT31) and other frequently methylated cancer-related genes (DAPK1, GSTP1, BRCA1, ECAD, and RASSF1) and survival of UDAT cancers. The study includes 219 SCC of UADT patients from different hospitals of Northeast India. Detection of HPV and aberrant promoter methylation was performed by PCR and Methylation Specific PCR respectively. Association study was conducted by Logistic regression analysis and overall survival analysis was done by Kaplan-Meier plot. HPV was detected in 37% of cases, with HPV-18 as the major high-risk sub-type. Although HPV presence did not seem to affect survival in overall UADT cancers, but was associated with a favourable prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Hierarchical clustering revealed three distinct clusters with different methylation profile and HPV presence. Among these, the CIMP-high subgroup exhibited the highest HPV positive cases (66%). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed a strong synergistic association of HPV and tobacco towards modulating promoter hypermethylation in UADT cancer (OR = 27.50 [95% CI = 11.51-88.03] for CIMP-high vs. CIMP-low). The present study proposes a potential role of HPV in impelling aberrant methylation in specific tumor related loci, which might contribute in the initiation and progression of SCC of UADT.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Persistent human papillomavirus infection (HPV) is recognized as an important etiologic factor for a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), especially those arising from the oropharynx. Whereas HPV16 accounts for the majority of HPV DNA-positive oropharyngeal SCC, infections with other mucosal high-risk HPV types are quite rare and biological data demonstrating their causal involvement are insufficient. Here we present the first case of an oropharyngeal SCC driven by HPV type 58. A 69-year-old Caucasian woman presented with an enlarged and firm left tonsil. A computed tomography scan showed a left tonsillar mass, extending to the soft palate and the glossotonsillar sulcus. The patient underwent extended radical tonsillectomy and ipsilateral selective neck dissection. Pathology confirmed an infiltrating, poorly differentiated SCC of the left tonsil with node metastasis (pT2N1). Adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (60 Grays (Gy)) was administered. After 1 year of follow-up, the patient is well with no evidence of cancer recurrence. HPV analyses of the tumor tissue by BSGP5+/6+ -PCR/MPG, targeting 51 mucosal HPV types, showed single positivity for HPV type 58. Presence of HPV58 E6*I RNA demonstrated biological activity of the virus in the tumor tissue, and presence of serum antibodies to HPV58 oncoproteins E6 and E7 indicated presence of an HPV58-driven cancer. Overexpression of cellular protein p16INK4a and reduced expression of pRb, two cellular markers for HPV-induced cell transformation, were observed. Exons 4-10 of TP53 showed no mutations or polymorphisms. The presence of HPV58 as single HPV infection in combination with a broad variety of direct and indirect markers of HPV transformation provides comprehensive evidence that this oropharyngeal SCC was driven by HPV58.

However, there is not a worldwide consensus on the methods to be used in clinical practice. The endpoint of this study was to demonstrate the reliability of a triple method which combines evaluation of: 1. p16 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (p16-IHC); 2. HPV-DNA genotyping by consensus HPV-DNA PCR methods (Consensus PCR); and 3 viral integration into the host by in situ hybridization method (ISH). This triple method has been applied to HN-SCC originated from oral cavity (OSCC) and oropharynx (OPSCC), the two anatomical sites in which high risk (HR) HPVs have been clearly implicated as etiologic factors. Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) was performed to study inactivation of p16-CDKN2a locus by epigenetic events. Reliability of multiple methods was measured by Kappa statistics.;All the HN-SCCs confirmed HPV positive by PCR and/or ISH were also p16 positive by IHC, with the latter showing a very high level of sensitivity as single test (100% in both OSCC and OPSCC) but lower specificity level (74% in OSCC and 93% in OPSCC).Concordance analysis between ISH and Consensus PCR showed a faint agreement in OPSCC (κ = 0.38) and a moderate agreement in OSCC (κ = 0.44). Furthermore, the addition of double positive score (ISHpositive and Consensus PCR positive) increased significantly the specificity of HR-HPV detection on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples (100% in OSCC and 78.5% in OPSCC), but reduced the sensitivity (33% in OSCC and 60% in OPSCC). The significant reduction of sensitivity by the double method was compensated by a very high sensitivity of p16-IHC detection in the triple approach.;Although HR-HPVs detection is of utmost importance in clinical settings for the Head and Neck Cancer patients, there is no consensus on which to consider the 'golden standard' among the numerous detection methods available either as single test or combinations. Until recently, quantitative E6 RNA PCR has been considered the 'golden standard' since it was demonstrated to have very high accuracy level and very high statistical significance associated with prognostic parameters. In contrast, quantitative E6 DNA PCR has proven to have very high level of accuracy but lesser prognostic association with clinical outcome than the HPV E6 oncoprotein RNA PCR. However, although it is theoretically possible to perform quantitative PCR detection methods also on FFPE samples, they reach the maximum of accuracy on fresh frozen tissue. Furthermore, worldwide diagnostic laboratories have not all the same ability to analyze simultaneously both FFPE and fresh tissues with these quantitative molecular detection methods. Therefore, in the current clinical practice a p16-IHC test is considered as sufficient for HPV diagnostic in accordance with the recently published Head and Neck Cancer international guidelines. Although p16-IHC may serve as a good prognostic indicator, our study clearly demonstrated that it is not satisfactory when used exclusively as the only HPV detecting method. Adding ISH, although known as less sensitive than PCR-based detection methods, has the advantage to preserve the morphological context of HPV-DNA signals in FFPE samples and, thus increase the overall specificity of p16/Consensus PCR combination tests.",

In order to test for the inactivation of other candidate replicative lifespan genes in the immortal cells of human tumors, we developed a series of mortal and immortal keratinocyte cultures derived from neoplastic lesions of the head and neck which were amenable to molecular genetic analysis by the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) technique. The results indicate that keratinocyte immortalization in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-HN) development involves the inactivation of at least two further pathways to senescence and four in all. Chromosomes 1, 4 and 7 carry genes representing immortality complementation groups C, B and D respectively and immortal keratinocytes showed LOH at either 4q32-q34 between D4S1554 and D4S171 (group B) or 7q31 (group D) but never 1q25 (group C). These results tentatively suggest that the genes responsible for the immortality complementation groups encode proteins on the same pathway to senescence. In addition, all of the immortal keratinocyte lines possessed high levels of telomerase activity and a suppressor of telomerase activity has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3p. Five out of eight lines showed LOH at 3p21.2-p21.3, a region which may carry a gene capable of suppressing SCC-HN telomerase. However, alternative mechanisms of telomerase reactivation were also suggested by our results. None of the above genetic alterations were seen in seven senescent neoplastic keratinocyte cultures. Other loci harbouring antiproliferative genes implicated in replicative lifespan showed few or no alterations and any alterations seen were additional to those described above.",

Each of the p16/HPV groups had different survival outcomes: p16+/HPV-HR cases (referent) had the best and p16-/HPV- cases had the worst DS survival (adj.HR=3.6; 53% versus 13%, p=0.004) whereas p16+/HPV- and p16-/HPV-HR had similar DS survival (adj.HR=2.7/2.8). p16-/HPV-HR cases had a worse recurrence rate (adj.HR=7.0; 60% versus 0%, referent, p=0.08) than p16-/HPV- (adj.HR=4.5) or p16+/HPV- (adj.HR=1.8) cases. The combined p16/HPV biomarker data are associated with different survival outcomes of HNC compared to each marker evaluated separately, indicating that the two molecular mechanisms evaluated together may provide a more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes.",

Moreover, the p16 beta transcript theoretically encodes a protein distinct from p16 derived from a divergent reading frame putatively initiated in exon 1 beta. To test the contribution of both of these transcripts in carcinogenesis, full-length cDNA of p16 and p16 beta were cloned in separate vector constructs and then transfected into HNSCC cell lines characterized for p16 status (p16[+/+], p16[mut/-], and p16[methylated]). Transfection of either p16 or p16 beta resulted in marked growth inhibition in all three HNSCC lines tested, regardless of p16 status. However, p16 beta but not p16 inhibited the growth of HeLa cells, a cell line with inactive pRB due to expression of E7 papillomavirus protein. Moreover, transfection of all three HNSCC lines with either p16 or p16 beta resulted in a marked increase in cells in G0-G1 consistent with a cell cycle arrest in G1. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that p16 and p16 beta are growth-inhibitory genes active in HNSCC and that both act by blocking progression through the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of p16 beta on HeLa growth suggest that p16 beta mediates its effect independently from pRB.",

Under the hypothesis that additional genes may play a role in drug sensitivity, a predictive model for lapatinib response was constructed from genome-wide DNA copy number data from 24 cancer cell lines. An optimal predictive model which consists of aberrations at nine distinct genetic loci, includes gains of HER2, EGFR, and loss of CDKN2A. This model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of approximately 0.85 (80% confidence interval, 0.70-0.98; P < 0.01), and correctly classified the sensitivity status of 8 of 10 head and neck cancer cell lines.

We investigated the presence of HPV genome by in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and P16 or Rb protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 336 surgically resected primary NSCLC: 204 adenocarcinoma (AdC) and 132 squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC).

Despite being solitary tumors and clinically considered as primary lung cancers, all 5 patients had past history of HPV associated squamous cell carcinomas of other organ sites, thus highly suggestive of being metastases. P16 immunostaining was found in 137 (40.8%) tumors, with 109 (32.4%) showing high level expression. All HPV positive (+) cases showed P16 high expression. P16 and Rb protein expressions were inversely correlated (P<0.001), suggesting that the high P16 expression is largely driven by non-HPV loss of Rb protein expression.

In this study, we used a mouse model of radiation-induced salivary hypofunction to investigate the outcomes of DNA damage in the head and neck region. We demonstrate that the loss of salivary function was closely accompanied by cellular senescence, as evidenced by a persistent DNA damage response (γH2AX and 53BP1) and the expression of senescence-associated markers (SA-βgal, p19ARF, and DcR2) and secretory phenotype (SASP) factors (PAI-1 and IL6). Notably, profound apoptosis or necrosis was not observed in irradiated regions. Signs of cellular senescence were also apparent in irradiated salivary glands surgically resected from human patients who underwent radiotherapy. Importantly, using IL6 knockout mice, we found that sustained expression of IL6 in the salivary gland long after initiation of radiation-induced DNA damage was required for both senescence and hypofunction. Additionally, we demonstrate that IL6 pretreatment prevented both senescence and salivary gland hypofunction via a mechanism involving enhanced DNA damage repair. Collectively, these results indicate that cellular senescence is a fundamental mechanism driving radiation-induced damage in the salivary gland and suggest that IL6 pretreatment may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to preserve salivary gland function in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.",

Genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrates molecular alterations to EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways in previously untreated tumors. Therefore, this study uses bioinformatics algorithms to delineate interactions resulting from EGFR inhibitor use in cancer cells with these genetic alterations. We modify the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line model to simulate cancer cells with constitutive activation of EGFR, HRAS, and PI3K in a controlled genetic background. We then measure gene expression after treating modified HaCaT cells with gefitinib, afatinib, and cetuximab. The CoGAPS algorithm distinguishes a gene expression signature associated with the anticipated silencing of the EGFR network. It also infers a feedback signature with EGFR gene expression itself increasing in cells that are responsive to EGFR inhibitors. This feedback signature has increased expression of several growth factor receptors regulated by the AP-2 family of transcription factors. The gene expression signatures for AP-2alpha are further correlated with sensitivity to cetuximab treatment in HNSCC cell lines and changes in EGFR expression in HNSCC tumors with low CDKN2A gene expression. In addition, the AP-2alpha gene expression signatures are also associated with inhibition of MEK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways in the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data. These results suggest that AP-2 transcription factors are activated as feedback from EGFR network inhibition and may mediate EGFR inhibitor resistance.",

Sixty-seven (29.7%) of HNC cases were found to be HPV DNA positive. Thirty-two (14%) cases were HPV-16 DNA positive and 20 (9%) cases expressed HPV-16 E7 mRNA. HPV-16 mRNA/p16 positive cases had significantly increased viral load and integrated HPV-16 DNA. In summary, of total HNC patients, 6% cases were positive for both HPV-16 DNA and p16, and 5% were positive for both E7 mRNA and p16 IHC. We observed similar HPV-16 DNA/E7mRNA prevalence in oropharynx and oral cavity sites, however, oropharynx SCC had significantly higher viral load.;Our results show low prevalence of active HPV-16 in North Indian HNC patients. HPV-16 E7 mRNA expression correlated with p16 nuclear positivity and increased viral load. Therefore, E7 mRNA expression may be used as a good surrogate indicator for active form of HPV-16 infection.",

Although, HPV has been detected in varied amounts in persons with oral dysplasia, leukoplakias and malignancies, its involvement in oral tongue carcinogenesis remains ambiguous.;HPV DNA prevalence was assessed by PCR with formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections (n=167) of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma patients and the physical status of the HPV16 DNA was assessed by qPCR. Immunohistochemistry was conducted for p16 evaluation.;We found the HPV prevalence in tongue cancers to be 51.2%, HPV 16 being present in 85.2% of the positive cases. A notable finding was a very poor concordance between HPV 16 DNA and p16 IHC findings (kappa<0.2). Further molecular classification of patients based on HPV16 DNA prevalence and p16 overexpression showed that patients with tumours showing p16 overexpression had increased hazard of death (HR=2.395; p=0.005) and disease recurrence (HR=2.581; p=0.002) irrespective of their HPV 16 DNA status.;Our study has brought out several key facets which can potentially redefine our understanding of tongue cancer tumorigenesis. It has emphatically shown p16 overexpression to be a single important prognostic variable in defining a high risk group and depicting a poorer prognosis, thus highlighting the need for its routine assessment in tongue cancers. Another significant finding was a very poor concordance between p16 expression and HPV infection suggesting that p16 expression should possibly not be used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection in tongue cancers. Interestingly, the prognostic significance of p16 overexpression is different from that reported in oropharyngeal cancers. The mechanism of HPV independent p16 over expression in oral tongue cancers is possibly a distinct entity and needs to be further studied.",

However, p16 as a surrogate marker for HR-HPV infection in cancers of the oral cavity remains controversial.;The objectives of the study were to investigate the expression of p16 and the presence of HR-HPV in OSCC and oral verrucous carcinoma (VC) and to determine if p16 could be used as a surrogate marker for HR-HPV.;Forty one formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of OSCC (n=37) or VC (n=4) with clinical and histopathologic data of each case were collected. Expression of p16 was determined by immunohistochemistry, focusing on both staining intensity and numbers of positive cells. The presence of HPV types 16 and 18 was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Descriptive statistics were employed to describe the demographic, clinical, and histopathologic parameters. Associations between p16 overexpression, HR-HPV and all variables were determined by Fisher's exact test, odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, the use of p16 as a surrogate marker for HR-HPV was analyzed by sensitivity and specificity tests.;p16 was overexpressed in 8/37 cases (21.6%) of OSCC and 2/4 cases (50%) of VC. HPV-16 was detected in 4/34 OSCC cases (11.8%) and HPV-18 was detected in 1/34 OSCC cases (2.9%). Co-infection of HPV-16/18 was detected in 1/4 VC cases (25%). Both p16 overexpression and HR-HPV were significantly associated with young patients with both OSCC and VC (<0.05, OR 20, 95% CI 1.9-211.8; <0.05, OR 23.3, 95% CI 2.4-229.7, respectively). p16 was able to predict the presence of HPV-16/18 in OSCC with 40% sensitivity and 79.3% specificity and in VC with 100% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity, respectively.;p16 overexpression was found in 24.4% of both OSCC and VC.

Two adjacent polymorphisms of p16 exon 3, C540G and C580T, were identified recently. C540G is associated with low expression of p53, and both polymorphisms are associated with tumor aggressiveness, suggesting a possible functional relevance. We hypothesized that these two polymorphisms, particularly their haplotypes, are associated with the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). To test this hypothesis, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 208 patients with SCCHN and 224 cancer-free control subjects to evaluate the association between p16 genotypes/haplotypes and the risk of SCCHN, using a PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism-based genotyping assay. However, our results suggested that no significant differences exist in the distribution of p16 C540G and C580T genotypes between cases and controls. For the C540G polymorphism, the CC, CG, and GG genotype frequencies were 76.9%, 22.1%, and 1.0%, respectively, in the cases, compared with 76.8%, 21.9%, and 1.3%, respectively, for the controls. For the C580T polymorphism, the CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 83.6%, 15.9%, and 0.5%, respectively, in the cases, compared with 82.6%, 16.5%, and 0.9%, respectively, for the controls. The frequencies of three predominant 540C/580C, 540G/580C, and 540C/580T haplotype alleles were distributed similarly in the cases (79.6%, 12.0%, and 8.4%) and in the controls (78.6%, 12.3%, and 9.1%). None of these differences were statistically significant. We conclude that these polymorphic p16 genotypes or haplotypes may not play a major role in the etiology of SCCHN, if any.

It has been shown that the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins are able to inactivate the tumor suppressor functions of p53 and Rb. In cervical and head and neck cancers, HPV infection is also associated with an overexpression of p16, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The expression of these cell cycle regulators in squamous cell carcinomas of the anorectal region has not been well studied. In the current study, 29 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the anorectal region were immunohistochemically examined for the expression of p16, Rb, and p53 proteins. Tumor cell DNA was also extracted from paraffin blocks and subjected to broad-spectrum HPV DNA testing and typing. The results show that the tumor cells exhibited a strong and diffuse nuclear stain (with some cytoplasmic positivity) for p16 in all 29 cases (100%). The adjacent nonneoplastic squamous epithelium or colonic mucosa, in contrast, was completely negative. Loss of Rb nuclear staining in tumor cells was observed in 20 cases (69%). The p53 protein was essentially undetectable, with only 6 cases containing <10% positive cells. HPV DNA was detected in every case (100%), with 25 cases (86%) harboring Type 16. In addition, almost identical results were obtained in 12 HPV-positive squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. This was in marked contrast to those of HPV-negative tumors, where positive p16 staining and loss of Rb expression were seen in only 2/21 (10%) and 1/21 (5%) cases, respectively. These observations indicate that overexpression of p16 and loss of Rb nuclear staining are commonly associated with high-risk HPV infection, which may serve as useful surrogate biomarkers for identifying squamous cell carcinomas harboring HPV DNA.",

However, a robust quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) method for comprehensive expression profiling of HPV genes in routinely fixed tissues has not been reported. To address this issue, we have established a new real-time RT-PCR method for the expression profiling of the E6 and E7 oncogenes from 13 high-risk HPV types. This method was validated in cervical cancer and by comparison with another HPV RNA detection method (in situ hybridization) in oropharyngeal tumors. In addition, the expression profiles of selected HPV-related human genes were also analyzed. HPV E6 and E7 expression profiles were then analyzed in 150 archived oropharyngeal SCC samples and compared with other variables and with patient outcomes. Our study showed that RT-qPCR and RNA in situ hybridization were 100% concordant in determining HPV status. HPV transcriptional activity was found in most oropharyngeal SCC (81.3%), a prevalence that is higher than in previous studies. Besides HPV16, three other HPV types were also detected, including 33, 35 and 18. Furthermore, HPV and p16 had essentially identical expression signatures, and both HPV and p16 were prognostic biomarkers for the prediction of disease outcome. Thus, p16 mRNA or protein expression signature is a sensitive and specific surrogate marker for HPV transcriptional activity (all genotypes combined).",

HPV16 is the most common genotype in these tumours but HPV6 and HPV11 can also be found in a minority of these cancers, implying that these low-risk HPV types are not entirely benign in the head and neck region. HPV status is also associated with p16 expression and HPV+ tumours are less likely to harbour p53 mutations. HPV DNA is closely associated with poorly differentiated cancers, positive lymph nodes and late-stage disease, which all indicate poor prognosis. Contradictory to this, patients with HPV+ HNSCC seem to have significantly improved response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy as compared with HPV-negative tumours. Interestingly, the risk factors of HNSCC are the same as for HPV, including the number of sexual partners, younger age at first sexual intercourse, practice of oral sex, history of genital warts and younger age.",

In particular, patients with advanced HNSCC have the poorest prognosis. To understand more about the contribution of cell cycle alterations to HNSCC development and their possible value in predicting prognosis and response to chemotherapy, we evaluated the levels of proteins involved in cell cycle control in patients diagnosed with advanced HNSCC.;A tissue microarray was made with 122 HNSCC specimens obtained from biopsy material. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinical and pathological characteristics.;Multiple alterations at various checkpoints of cell cycle progression were observed. Loss of P16 protein was less common in oropharyngeal tumors than at other HNSCC locations (P = 0.02). Evaluation of the simultaneous expression of different proteins highlighted direct correlations (P < 0.05) such as that of the cyclin-dependent kinases with their cyclin-partners, and the Ki-67 protein with cyclin-dependent kinases 1, cyclin A (CA) and cyclin B1. Median overall survival and time-to-progression were longer in patients with CA-expressing tumors (not reached versus 34.4 months, P = 0.02) and (47.3 versus 14.6 months, P = 0.006), respectively. Moreover, expression of CA in tumors predicted a better response to chemotherapy. Positive expression of cyclin E in tumors was also associated with an increased median time-to-progression (14.6 versus 25.8 months, P = 0.04). Finally, patients with cyclin D1-expressing tumors had shorter median overall survival (29.6 months versus not reached, P = 0.05) and shorter median time-to-progression (21.5 months versus not reached, P = 0.06).

Fibroblasts from genetically unstable OSCC relative to the other fibroblast subtypes grew more slowly and stimulated the invasion of a non-tumourigenic keratinocyte cell line into fibroblast-rich collagen gels. To understand these findings, genome-wide transcriptional profiles were generated using the GeneChip(®) cDNA whole transcript microarray platform. Principal component analysis showed that the fibroblasts could be distinguished according to the stage of tumour development. Tumour progression was associated with down-regulation of cell cycle- and cytokinesis-related genes and up-regulation of genes encoding transmembrane proteins including cell adhesion molecules. Gene expression was validated in independent fibroblast strains using qRT-PCR. Gene connectivity and interactome-transcriptome associations were determined using a systems biology approach to interrogate the gene expression data. Clusters of gene signatures were identified that characterized genetically unstable and stable OSCCs relative to each other and to fibroblasts from normal oral mucosa. The expression of highly connected genes associated with unstable OSCCs, including those that encode α-SMA and the integrin α6, correlated with poor patient prognosis in an independent dataset of head and neck cancer. The results of this study demonstrate that fibroblasts from unstable OSCCs represent a phenotypically distinguishable subset that plays a major role in oral cancer biology.",

In addition, if supported by currently on-going clinical trials, attribution of a HNC to HPV may allow better and less toxic treatments. Here we focused on studies in which the prevalence of molecular and serological HPV markers was similarly assessed in oropharyngeal and non-oropharyngeal HNC. Large data on HPV DNA detection by PCR and p16 expression in HNC biopsies suggests that the probability of a cancer of the oral cavity, larynx, and hypopharynx being attributable to HPV is at least 5-fold lower than that for oropharyngeal cancer. Seropositivity for HPV16 E6 or E7 shows larger differences across sites, but findings vary between studies. Because HPV DNA and p16 detection lack specificity, and E6 and E7 antibody detection lacks sensitivity, these tests are not totally satisfactory. Limited data on in situ hybridization or HPV E6/E7 mRNA, mainly from the United States, suggests that HPV-attributable HNC is rare in the oral cavity (∼3%), larynx (∼7%), and hypopharynx (∼0%). Data on HPV in other rarer HNCs are extremely limited and essentially negative. Available data do not allow the establishment of the way HPV infection and tobacco may interact in non-oropharyngeal HNC. The exclusion of oropharynx as a site of tumor origin and the identification of robust fingerprints of HPV-driven carcinogenesis are the priorities to improve the estimate of HPV-attributable non-oropharyngeal HNC.

        "Doc_abstract":"Patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP) in the head neck region are generally treated with neck dissection followed by radiotherapy at times combined with chemotherapy, a treatment associated with considerable side effects. Some of these tumors may originate as human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), with better clinical outcome than head neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) in general, and could potentially do well with less treatment. Here, we therefore investigated whether HPV status and p53-expression correlated to clinical outcome in patients with CUP in the head neck region. Fifty metastases were analyzed for presence of HPV DNA, and expression of p16(INK4A) and p53 and the data were correlated to clinical outcome. Patients with HPV DNA-positive (HPVDNA+) metastases had significantly better 5-year overall survival (OS) compared to those with HPVDNA- metastases (80.0% vs. 36.7%, respectively; P = 0.004), with a similar tendency for disease-free survival (DFS). These survival rates showed excellent concordance with those of HPVDNA+ and HPVDNA- OSCC in Sweden during the same time period, strengthening the hypothesis that HPVDNA+ head and neck CUP may originate from HPVDNA+ OSCC. In addition, having absent/intermediary-low as compared to high expression of p53 correlated to a better prognosis with a 69% as compared to 14% 5-year OS, respectively (P < 0.001), and for DFS the tendency was analogous. In conclusion, both HPV status and p53 expression are valuable prognostic factors in patients with CUP in the head and neck region and should be further explored for clinical use.",

Although the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a well known causative agent in NPC, recent reports have implicated oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in a subgroup of these tumours. The recent striking rise of oropharyngeal carcinoma has been attributed to HPV, but little is known about the prevalence and clinical significance of the virus in NPC. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of oncogenic HPV in NPC from tissue archives of two head and neck cancer centres in the UK.;Samples were available for 67 patients with clinically validated NPC. The detection of high-risk HPV was carried out by screening all cases for p16 using immunohistochemistry and HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using GP5+/6+ primers. All cases with p16 over-expression or positive for HPV by PCR were then examined by high-risk HPV DNA in-situ hybridisation and genotype analysis by PCR.;Eleven cases (11/67, 16.4%) showed concurrent over-expression of p16 and evidence of high-risk HPV DNA by in-situ hybridisation; the majority were HPV16 positive. Of these 11 cases, nine occurred in Whites and two in Blacks. Histologically, there were two keratinising squamous cell carcinoma and nine non-keratinising carcinomas (eight differentiated and one undifferentiated). None of the HPV-positive cases showed any co-infection with EBV. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival outcome between patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative NPC.;The results of this study show that oncogenic HPV is associated with a subgroup of NPCs and is more likely to occur in Whites. However, unlike oropharyngeal carcinoma there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative NPC.",

Most patients with HPV-HR DNA-positive tumors develop anti-HPV E6/E7 antibodies; however, it is unclear whether those who mount an immune response have similar risk factors or clinical outcomes as those who do not. HPV-16 DNA tumor-positive HNC cases were evaluated for HPV-16 E6 and E7 antibodies using a GST capture ELISA system. Among 57 HPV-16 DNA tumor-positive HNC cases, 67% were detected with HPV-16 E6 and/or E7 antibodies. Male gender (76% vs. 42%, p = 0.02), younger age (63% vs. 16%, p = 0.001) but not tobacco or alcohol were associated with E6 and/or E7 seropositivity. Seropositivity was associated more often with late stage (76%), poor grade (65%), positive nodes (82%). and in the oropharynx (82%), Median disease-specific and recurrence-free survival were longer in E6 and/or E7 seropositive compared to E6/E7-negative cases (2.2 years vs. 1.4 years, both outcomes), although results were not statistically significant. When examined jointly with p16 expression, E6 and/or E7-positive/p16-positive cases had better disease-specific (2.1 years vs. 1.1 years, p = 0.06) and recurrence-free (2.3 years vs. 1.1 years, p = 0.03) survival compared to E6-/E7-/p16- cases. These findings suggest there are 2 distinct HNC patient groups with HPV DNA-positive tumors, distinguishable by E6 and/or E7 antibody status. Differences in antibody status are associated with distinct risk factors and clinical outcomes.

The loss of expression of p16 and p27, two other cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors, was also examined. In this panel of tumours, 10/24 carcinomas were p53-immunopositive. Heterogeneous expression of p21 and p27 was seen in 10/24 SCC and 9/16 SCC, respectively, and this was not correlated to p53 status. The expression of p21 and p27 in these SCCs suggests the existence of mechanisms by which some growing tumour cells may tolerate these cell cycle inhibitors; eight SCCs lacked expression of both inhibitors but only two of these cancers overexpressed p53, suggesting that accumulation of p21/p27 can be independent of the functional status of the p53 gene. Data do not support a clear example of a phenotype that shows an overexpression of p53 with downregulation of p21 or p27 leading to cell cycle alterations. Furthermore, only three SCCs were p16-negative and p53-positive. This suggests that these two tumour suppressors may act in separate pathways.",

Because of the prognostic advantage of patients with HPV-positive cancers, the issue of the quality of life of survivors has become increasingly important. The possibility of treatment de-escalation in patients with virally induced tumors is being considered. Many challenges have to be addressed in order to integrate HPV status in the routine decision-making in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. The present review discusses the standardization of detection methods suitable for clinical use and the differences in predictive parameters between patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors.;The gold standard for the identification of patients with oropharyngeal tumors etiologically linked to HPV infection is undoubtedly the detection of HPV 16 E6/E7 mRNA. The detection of a surrogate marker of active viral infection, p16ink4a, has a low sensitivity when used alone and must therefore be combined with the detection of HPV DNA or HPV-specific antibodies. The detailed knowledge of the importance of specific prognostic parameters is crucial in the choice of treatment. Nodal staging is probably much less important in HPV-positive cancers.;It is of great importance to implement standardized testing for the identification of patients with HPV-induced oropharyngeal tumors. The treatment decision models in HPV-positive tumors have to take into account the probably different prognostic value of nodal parameters. Before introducing treatment de-escalation in patients with virally induced tumors into clinical practice, more research and clinical studies are needed.",

Here, we report an initial characterization of the E1 cistron of HPV type 16 (HPV-16), the most common oncogenic mucosal HPV type found in cervical and some head and neck cancers. The first step in HPV DNA replication is an initial burst of plasmid viral DNA amplification. Complementation assays between HPV-16 genomes carrying mutations in the early genes confirmed that the expression of E1 was necessary for initial HPV-16 plasmid synthesis. The major early HPV-16 promoter, P97, was dispensable for E1 production in the initial amplification because cis mutations inactivating P97 did not affect the trans complementation of E1- mutants. In contrast, E1 expression was abolished by cis mutations in the splice donor site at nucleotide (nt) 226, the splice acceptor site at nt 409, or a TATAA box at nt 7890. The mapping of 5' mRNA ends using rapid amplification of cDNA ends defined a promoter with a transcription start site at HPV-16 nt 14, P14. P14-initiated mRNA levels were low and required intact TATAA (7890). E1 expression required the HPV-16 keratinocyte-dependent enhancer, since cis mutations in its AP-2 and TEF-1 motifs abolished the ability of the mutant genomes to complement E1- genomes, and it was further modulated by origin-proximal and -distal binding sites for the viral E2 gene products. We conclude that P14-initiated E1 expression is critical for and limiting in the initial amplification of the HPV-16 genome.",

The induction of HPV-induced cancer is driven by virus-specific oncoproteins E6 and E7. E6 protein of HPV types 16 and 18 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein p53. E7 inactivates retinoblastoma protein (Rb) by phosphorylation followed by an increase of free eukaryotic transcription factor E2F (E2F) in the cell. This leads to an increase of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16, that is used as an immunohistochemical marker of HPV-associated OSCC. Unfortunately, p16 is not exclusively increased by E7 oncoprotein in carcinogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an immunohistochemical approach for the direct detection of E6/E7 oncoproteins in uterine cervical cancer as well as in OSCC.;Paraffin sections of uterine cervical cancer and 130 were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining protocols were evaluated with tissue slides from patients with cervical dysplasia (CIN III) and squamous epithelial carcinoma tissue with HPV infection. Liver and placental tissues were used as negative controls. E6-Specific antibody (Biorbyt) was used as primary antibody. The polymer staining method and diaminobenzidine were applied for further development. Panels of E7-specific antibodies were tested. Again, the polymer staining method and diaminobenzidine were applied for further development.;E6-Specific antibody revealed specific and intense staining after pre-incubation of tissue slides with citrate buffer solution. Only the E7 antibody obtained from Chemicon showed intense and specific staining in patients with CIN III and squamous epithelial carcinoma tissue. Pre-incubation with proteinase K diminished non-specific reaction.;Our results revealed a useful staining protocol for the immunohistochemical evaluation of E6/E7 oncoprotein expression in uterine cervical cancer, as well as in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Advantages of this method compared to mRNA in situ hybridization of E6/E7 are the much lower costs, as well as the broader applicability in pathological practice.",

Although patients with HNSCCs are often treated with radiotherapy, preclinical models are limited by the ability to deliver precise radiation to orthotopic tumors and to monitor treatment responses accordingly. To better model this clinical scenario, we developed a novel autochthonous HPV-positive oral tumor model to track responses to small molecules and image-guided radiation. We used a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase system to conditionally express the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 as well as a luciferase reporter (iHPV-Luc) in the epithelial cells of transgenic mice. In the presence of activated Cre recombinase, luciferase activity, and by proxy, HPV oncogenes were induced to 11-fold higher levels. In triple transgenic mice containing the iHPV-Luc, K14-CreER(tam), and LSL-Kras transgenes, tamoxifen treatment resulted in oral tumor development with increased bioluminescent activity within 6 days that reached a maximum of 74.8-fold higher bioluminescence compared with uninduced mice. Oral tumors expressed p16 and MCM7, two biomarkers associated with HPV-positive tumors. After treatment with rapamycin or image-guided radiotherapy, tumors regressed and possessed decreased bioluminescence. Thus, this novel system enables us to rapidly visualize HPV-positive tumor growth to model existing and new interventions using clinically relevant drugs and radiotherapy techniques.",

In rare cases, the presence of cilia in a primary HPV-OPC and their persistence in lymph node metastasis can confound the distinction between a benign and malignant process. Three cases of ciliated HPV-OPCs were identified from the archives of The Johns Hopkins Head and Neck Pathology consultation service. HPV status was determined using p16 immunohistochemistry and high-risk HPV in situ hybridization. All 3 patients presented with a cystic lymph node metastasis without a known primary carcinoma. One metastasis was originally diagnosed as a branchial cleft cyst only to regionally recur 7 years later. In 2 cases, a primary HPV-OPC was found in the tonsil. The carcinomas exhibited both nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium and cystic/microcystic spaces lined by ciliated columnar cells. Both the squamous and ciliated cells were HPV positive. This report draws attention to a novel variant of HPV-related head and neck cancer that exhibits ciliated columnar cells. This variant challenges prevailing notions that: (1) HPV-OPCs are uniformly poorly differentiated cancers; (2) cilia are an infallible feature of benignancy; and (3) presence of cilia is a reliable criterion for establishing branchial cleft origin when dealing with cystic lesions of the lateral neck.

We applied HPV DNA PCR and p16 immunohistochemistry to all TSCCs registered in the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA) and in the Danish Pathology Data Bank (n = 632). Pathologists reviewed and subdivided the tumors into two groups: specified and nonspecified TSCCs. Approximately 10% of HPV-positive tumors was genotyped by amplicon next-generation sequencing. The overall crude incidence of TSCCs increased significantly (2.7% per year) and was explained by an increasing incidence of HPV-positive TSCCs (4.9% per year). The overall HPV prevalence was 58%, with HPV16 being the predominant HPV type. In multivariate analysis, the HPV prevalence was associated with age (<55 vs. >60 years) (OR, 1.72; 95% CI 1.13-2.63) and origin (nonspecified vs. specified TSCCs) (OR, 0.15; 95% CI 0.11-0.22).

These reductions in T cell response could not be explained by a concurrent decrease in memory T cells whose absolute numbers were relatively unaffected by radical therapy (27,975 vs. 25,661/10(5) PBMC) despite a significant decrease in overall lymphocyte counts (1.74 vs. 0.69 × 10(9)/L). Instead, there were significant increases in regulatory T cells (3.7 vs. 6.8 %) and a population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD14(-)HLA-DR(-)CD15(hi), 12.38 vs. 21.92 %). This suggests that immunosuppression may contribute to the reduction in HPV-specific T cell responses post-treatment, although study of larger patient cohorts will be required to test whether this affects clinical outcome. Overall these findings suggest that HPV-targeted immunotherapy in post-therapy OPC patients will require multiple strategies to boost T cell immunity and to overcome the influence of immunosuppressive cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Perhaps one of the most important developments in head and neck oncology of the past decade is the demonstration that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-mediated oropharyngeal cancers have significantly improved outcomes, compared to HPV-negative counterpart patients. This has become the basis for clinical trials investigating the impact on \"treatment deintensification\" for patients with HPV-mediated oropharyngeal cancers. Unfortunately, the significance of HPV in non-oropharyngeal head and neck cancers is much less certain. Our goal is to systematically review the published data regarding the role HPV in carcinomas of the oral cavity, larynx, sinonasal tract and nasopharynx with respect to HPV detection frequency, viral activity, and association with outcome. We also present preliminary data on HPV16/18 transcriptional status in oral cavity carcinomas, as well as salivary gland neoplasia, as determined by nested reverse transcription PCR for HPV E6/E7 RNA. The weighted prevalence (WP) of HPV DNA detection in 4,195 oral cavity cancer patients is 20.2 %, (95 % CI 16.0 %, 25.2 %). HPV16 is the most common type detected. Importantly, no data currently demonstrates a significant association between the presence of HPV DNA and improved outcome. The WP of HPV DNA in 1,712 laryngeal cancer patients is 23.6 %, (95 % CI 18.7 %, 29.3 %). Similarly, no association has yet been demonstrated between HPV DNA status and outcome. The WP of HPV DNA detection in 120 sinonasal cancer patients is 29.6 % (95 % CI 17.8 %, 44.9 %), and in 154 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients is 31.1 %, (95 % CI 20.3 %, 44.5 %). Recent preliminary data also suggests an association between HPV and certain salivary gland neoplasms. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. The published data strongly support the need for studies on patients with oral and laryngeal carcinomas that will be powered to find any differences in clinical outcome with respect to HR-HPV and p16 overexpression.",

The prognosis of patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas is better than that for patients with non-HPV-related cancers. Researchers and clinicians can test for HPV infection in cancer by (1) testing directly for HPV DNA and (2) testing for overexpression of the downstream p16 protein; there is currently no consensus regarding which is the better test. The chances of developing a reliable oropharyngeal HPV screening test for high-risk populations are promising. Such a test would allow for secondary prevention by identifying individuals with precursor or early-stage cancerous lesions that are more amenable to treatment. HPV testing has particular significance in SCC of an unknown primary site in head and neck cancer. Successful HPV testing of nodal metastasis can localize cancer specifically to the oropharynx. The optimal evaluation for SCC of an unknown primary in the head and neck has yet to be determined. Some studies have shown that the tonsillar fossa is the most probable primary site, followed closely by the base of the tongue. Biopsies often miss tonsillar carcinoma in the deep crypts of the lymph tissue, as well as in those rare cases in which the primary tumor is located contralateral to the metastatic lymph node. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of reports of diagnosed synchronous bilateral HPV-related tonsillar carcinomas. This increase has profound implications for the surgical approach of SCC of an unknown primary site in the head and neck and in tonsillar carcinoma, and it supports the need for bilateral tonsillectomy. We present 2 cases of incidentally discovered synchronous bilateral tonsillar carcinoma, and we review the literature. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx is a well-defined entity mostly affecting young to middle-aged male non-smokers. It is generally associated with a favourable outcome, and for this reason a less intensive therapeutic approach has been proposed for this subset of patients. The incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers is rapidly increasing in most Western countries, but detailed epidemiological data are not available for the Italian population. Furthermore, among other head and neck regions, a smaller proportion of oral high-grade dysplasia and cancers seems to depend on HPV infection, whereas its role in laryngeal cancer is recognised as less relevant. HPV-dependent neoplastic transformation depends on the expression of viral oncogenes in the infected host cell that can only be directly documented through viral oncogene mRNA identification. The consensus on how to classify these patients from clinical and laboratory diagnostic points of view is still limited, with different approaches based on one or more diagnostic techniques including p16 immunostaining, in situ hybridisation and polymerase chain reation (PCR) amplification of viral DNA. The possibility of early diagnosis relying on the identification of HPV infection in oral and oropharyngeal exfoliated cells has so far provided unsatisfactory results, although viral persistence after treatment has been associated with risk of recurrence. Presently, sufficient data are not available to document the natural history and progression from tonsillar HPV infection to oropharyngeal cancer development, and to clearly define the modality of transmission and risk exposure, among which sexual behaviours appear to play a relevant role. The diffusion of HPV vaccination and its administration to both genders will undoubtedly dramatically modify the epidemiology of HPV-related head and neck cancers in the coming years.",

This study was performed to quantify the dose-dependent impact on RR and overall survival (OS) in a prospectively collected cohort of OPC from the ARTSCAN study with emphasis on elective treatment.;ARTSCAN is a previously published prospective, randomized, multicentre study of altered radiotherapy (RT) fractionation in head and neck cancer. In ARTSCAN the elective treatment volume for node positive OPC varied significantly between centres due to local treatment principles. All patients with OPC in complete response after primary treatment were eligible for the present case-control study. Cases were patients with RR during five years follow-up. Patients with no recurrence were eligible as controls. Four controls per case were matched according to T- and N-stage. Mean (D mean) and median (D 50%) dose for the lymph node level (LNL) of RR in the cases and the corresponding LNL in the controls were analysed with conditional logistic regression. OS was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated by multivariate Cox regression analysis.;There was a dose-dependent risk reduction for D 50% in the interval that represented elective treatment (40-50 Gy) (OR = 0.18, p < 0.05) and a trend in the same dose interval for D mean (OR = 0.19, p = 0.07).
