        "Background":"['Drug resistance is one of important factors limiting effect of most cancer therapies. Understanding mechanisms causing resistance can facilitate overcoming resistance. c-MET gene activation, via either activating mutations or gene amplification, is an oncogenic driver for some non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) in patients as well as in patient derived xenograft (PDX) (1). c-MET gene activation is also one of the two most dominant TKI-resistance seen among the patients treated with EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) (1, 2). Therefore, c-MET inhibitor could become an important treatment option for NSCLC patients whose c-MET is either de nova activated or activated during TKI treatment (1). We recently demonstrated that Crizotinib (PF2341066), an approved drug against NSCLC with ALK-fusion and a known c-MET inhibitor, can effectively treat NSCLC with c-MET gene amplification, including those resistant to EGFR-TKIs (1), in PDXs. Specifically, we described two models LU1901 and LU2503  both with amplified gene, accompanied with over-expression, of c-MET, and both sensitive to Crizotinib (complete regression in LU2503, while near-complete regression in LU1901) (1), confirming the c-MET activation as dominant oncogenic driver for these two tumors.In the present study, interestingly, the treated LU1901 tumors subsequently re-emerge and re-grow even in the presence of continuous treatment. In particular, the re-growed LU1901 become completely resistant to Crizotinib (we call LU1901R), even after it was re-engrafted. Pharmacodynamic analysis revealed that the LU1901R tumor has similar level of phosphorylation (or activation) of c-MET as the parental LU1901. Crizotinib treatment caused nearly-similar inhibition of c-MET in both LU1901 and LU1901R, as well as the downstream signaling, including pMEK and pAKT by Crizotinib in both LU1901 and LU1901R tumors along with c-MET inhibition. All these suggest that the threshold of c-MET activation for prompting tumor growth/survival is significantly lower in LU1901R than LU1901. We are currently characterizing the LU1901R in order to identify the mechanisms of resistance, and attempt to find approach to overcome them.In summary, we have successfully developed c-MET inhibitor resistant models that may reflect resistance emergence in the clinics. These models could be particularly useful in investigating clinical resistant mechanisms and evaluating new therapy that can overcome resistance.']",

It is widely expressed and associated with poor prognosis in breast, lung, liver, kidney and brain cancers. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the only known ligand of c-Met, also found in many tumors and cancers where activity is driven by the c-Met receptor. c-Met is accepted as an attractive anti-cancer target, but the development of cancer therapy targeting c-Met receptor or kinase remain very challenging. Clinical development of c-Met/HGF targeting antibodies has shown initial evidence of clinical efficacy but failed in phase III. Small molecule inhibitors often suffer from selectivity issues. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) which combine an antibody with highly potent cytotoxic agents, becomes an attractive approach against c-Met overexpressing cancers such NSCLC. We have identified an anti-c-Met antibody STI-0602 and generated ADCs from a panel of cytotoxic agents such as microtubulin inhibitor and DNA damaging agents. ADCs retained the binding to c-Met receptor and showed potent cell killing in a variety of c-Met-positive cell lines. ADCs also showed in vivo efficacy in a panel of c-Met-positive human NSCLC xenograft models like A549, H292, EBC-1, HCC827 and H1993, which suggest a potential therapy for c-Met overexpressing lung cancer and other cancers.']",

Methods', ' We retrospectively analyzed 1199 consecutive NSCLC patients, who were tested for C-MET expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) between Nov 2013 and Sep 2015. The staining intensity within tumor tissue was graded on a scale of 0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate), and 3+ (strong). C-MET positivity was defined as C-MET expression with strong staining intensity (grade 3+) in more than 50% of tumor cells. Among 262 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation, 83 EGFR-mutant patients received EGFR-TKI as a first line therapy. Results', ' In total of 1199 tumors, the frequency of each tumor with C-MET grade 0 to grade 3+ was 10.8%, 41.0%, 32.5%, and 15.7%, respectively. C-MET expression was significantly stronger in the tumors with adenocarcinoma than those with squamous cell carcinoma (P< 0.001). In the tumors with adenocarcinoma, EGFR-mutant tumors showed stronger expression of C-MET than EGFR-wild type tumors (P< 0.001) but no difference in C-MET expression by mutation types was observed (P= 0.248). In the first-line EGFR-TKI treatment group, there was no significant difference in response rate to EGFR-TKI between the patients with C-MET positivity (n = 7) and those with C-MET negativity (n = 76) (71% vs. 88%, P= 0.231). However, the median progression-free survival (PFS) to EGFR-TKI was significantly shorter in the C-MET positive group compared with the C-MET negative group (4.3 months vs. 11.9 months, P= 0.015). Conclusions', ' C-MET overexpression was associated with shorter PFS to EGFR-TKI in the patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

        "Background":"['c-Met is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and is the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). c-Met is involved in many mechanisms of cancer proliferation and metastasis. Inappropriate activation of c-Met can be induced by ligand-independent mechanisms such as gene amplification, specific genetic mutations, and transcriptional up-regulation, or by ligand-dependent autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Despite the successful development of EGFR- or EML4-ALK-targetd therapies, treatment options remain limited for patients with advanced lung cancer, making the identification of new therapeutic targets essential. c-Met expression was reported in 41-72% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), amplification of c-Met occurs in 5-10 % of patients, and c-Met mutations have been detected in 8-13% of patients. We have developed a bi-valent c-Met antibody LY2875358 (LA480), which blocks ligand-dependent and ligand-independent c-Met activations. It is currently in clinical development.

        "Background":"['Tumor invasiveness and therapeutic resistance strongly contribute to the low (<10%) five-year survival rate for advanced stage lung cancer; thus, identification of novel interventions targeting metastasis and therapeutic resistance is a necessity. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) are two cell surface receptors known to be associated with lung cancer invasiveness and cell survival. Our lab recently demonstrated that Fn14 was over-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlated with activated epidermal growth factor receptor, and that expression of Fn14 modulated NSCLC cell invasiveness and metastasis. We hypothesize that elevated Fn14 expression can be maintained by c-Met activation, and that blockade of Fn14 can suppress NSCLC invasiveness driven by c-Met. Here we demonstrate that Fn14 protein expression significantly correlated with c-Met expression in primary NSCLC patient tumors. Fn14 and c-Met were more highly expressed in metastatic tumors compared to patient-matched primary NSCLC tumors, suggesting a role in the metastatic phenotype. To further elucidate the relationship between Fn14 and c-Met in NSCLC invasiveness, we employed two cell lines derived from a primary tumor (H2073) and metastatic lymph node (H1993) of the same patient. H1993 cells (c-Met receptor amplification) expressed significantly elevated protein levels of Fn14 compared to H2073 (low c-Met), which were significantly diminished in H1993 cells upon c-Met inhibition through SU11274 treatment. Moreover, exposure of H2073 cells to HGF induced the protein expression of Fn14. The elevated expression of Fn14 through HGF stimulation (H2073) or c-Met receptor amplification (H1993) was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with U0126, a potent MEK inhibitor, suggesting that c-Met-induced Fn14 expression may depend on MAPK signaling. To further elucidate the effect of Fn14 on global c-Met-induced expression, genome-wide expression analysis was employed to determine genes both over-expressed in H1993 compared to H2073 and subsequently suppressed in Fn14 depleted H1993 cells. RALGPS2, a gene over-expressed in lung tumors that induces of c-fos and OPRL1, a gene elevated in metastatic melanoma, were elevated in the metastatic cell line and subsequently suppressed with Fn14 depletion. In addition, shRNA-mediated depletion of Fn14 in H1993 cells attenuated cell migration and invasion by 45% and 40%, respectively. This work demonstrates that c-Met and Fn14 may play a critical role in NSCLC metastasis, and suggests that targeting Fn14 may impact c-Met-driven NSCLC invasiveness. Successful targeting of NSCLC invasiveness would have significant clinical impact on a disease that is deadly in its advanced stages.']",

        "Background":"['c-Met and EGFR are therapeutic targets in NSCLC with a direct role in tumor progression. Highly specific TKIs against c-Met, have limited efficacy individually, and resistance to c-Met TKIs could be due to activation/mutations in EGFR, or c-Met amplification/mutations which could lead to increased expression and constitutive phosphorylation of c-Met. In recent clinical trials, simultaneous treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against c-Met/EGFR has improved patient prognosis, however, their efficacy has been limited due to the development of resistance to TKIs. To establish the mechanism of TKI resistance in NSCLC, two cell lines (H2170 and H358) were made resistant to c-Met and EGFR TKIs (15-30 fold increase in IC50 of SU11274 and 8-10 fold increase in IC50 of Erlotinib) by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of both drugs simultaneously. In H2170 cell lines, a 4-fold downregulation p-cMet 1003 (c-cbl binding site) and a 5-fold increase in p-c-Met 1234/1235 (autophosphorylation site) was observed. Additionally, several proteins in signaling pathways (mTOR and Wnt) linked to EGFR and c-Met, were also found to be differentially modulated in H2170 and H358 resistant lines', ' active -catenin (1.5-2.5 fold increase), p-mTOR (2-4 fold increase), and phospho-pS6kinase (2-20 fold increase). Interestingly, few differences were observed in p-ERK or p-AKT, which are EGFR/c-Met downstream signaling proteins, indicating that other pathways such as mTOR and Wnt may cause TKI resistance. To confirm the role of mTOR and Wnt pathways in resistance and to break their resistance, parental and resistant cell lines were treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the Wnt inhibitor XAV 939 in addition to c-Met and EGFR TKIs. An MTT viability assay showed resistant cell lines to be 2-4 fold more susceptible in comparison to parental cells with the addition of everolimus to TKI combination treatment. In response to the Wnt inhibitor XAV 939, parental cell lines showed no significant increase in sensitivity while resistant lines showed a 2.5-3 fold decrease in viability when compared to c-Met and EGFR TKI combination treatment. Our results suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to c-Met TKI which are mediated by increased c-Met stability, resulting in increases in Wnt expression/mTOR activation. The decreased phosphorylation of c-Met 1003 may lead to decreased binding/activity of Cbl and/or deficient ubiquitination of c-Met. This may result in increased stabilization of c-Met as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of c-Met 1234/1235 and the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Wnt pathways which has been shown. These studies suggest a new treatment modality since inhibitors of Wnt pathway or agents targeting -catenin have not entered clinical testing. These results suggest that Wnt/ mTOR inhibitors combined with c-Met/EGFR TKIs may be a novel combination therapy for lung cancer.']",

Several resistance mechanisms have been identified; EGFR T790M mutation and aberrant activation of c-Met through c-Met gene amplification and/or HGF upregulation are the two most common mechanisms. We have previously shown that combining the highly selective c-Met inhibitor tepotinib with 1st or 2nd-generation EGFR TKIs overcomes gefitinib resistance caused only by c-MET amplification. Third-generation EGFR TKIs such as rociletinib have been developed specifically to overcome T790M-mediated resistance to EGFR TKIs. We hypothesized that combining a 3rd-generation EGFR TKI with tepotinib could overcome resistance to a 1st or 2nd-generation EGFR TKI (e.g. gefitinib) regardless of the mechanism of resistance.We assessed the efficacy of tepotinib and a Merck-synthesized version of rociletinib (MSR) as monotherapy or in combination in a NSCLC cell line xenograft model (HCC827-GR-T790M) with an EGFR del 19 mutation, c-Met amplification, and exogenous T790M expression, and in a patient-derived xenograft model (DFCI081) with an EGFR del 19 mutation and c-Met amplification, but not a T790M mutation.Single-agent tepotinib, erlotinib, and afatinib did not show antitumor activity in HCC827-GR-T790M xenografts and tumors progressed on treatment (median tumor volume [TV] changes >73%). The combinations of tepotinib + erlotinib and tepotinib + afatinib delayed tumor regrowth more than single-agent therapy, but were no more effective than single-agent MSR. In contrast, the combination of tepotinib + MSR had strong antitumor activity in this model with double resistance due to c-Met amplification and exogenous T790M expression, resulting in complete tumor regression (median TV change -97%).In the patient-derived xenograft model DFCI081, tumors progressed under single-agent therapy with the EGFR TKIs erlotinib, afatinib, and MSR, as expected given that this cell line expresses c-Met. In contrast, tepotinib induced complete tumor regression as monotherapy and when combined with each of the EGFR TKIs (median TV change -100%). Complete regression was maintained until the end of the 60-day observation period after treatment termination.These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that combining tepotinib with a 3rd-generation EGFR TKI to overcome double resistance to 1st and 2nd-generation TKIs mediated by T790M and c-Met in NSCLC is more effective than using either agent alone. Furthermore, whereas EGFR TKIs were not effective in tumor models showing c-Met amplification and EGFR del 19 mutation but not T790M mutation, ie resistance is c-Met mediated, tepotinib monotherapy induced complete tumor regression.']",

        "Background":"['ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and c-MET are molecular drivers for a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Approximately 4-7% of NSCLCs carry the EML4-ALK chromosomal rearrangement. We identified overexpression of EGFR and c-MET in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cell lines H3122 and H2228. ALK, EGFR, and c-MET may function cooperatively to modulate tumor growth, stress response, and survival in EML4-ALK-positive cells and co-inhibition may favorably impact tumor control. We therefore investigated the effects of co-inhibition of ALK and EGFR or c-MET on cell survival and response to radiation in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cells.Compared with ALK-negative cell lines (H226, A549 and H520), the ALK-positive cell lines (H3122, H2228) were highly sensitive to the ALK inhibitors crizotinb, ceritinib and alectinib, although with differing sensitivity to radiation. Crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib sensitized H3122 and H2228 to radiation, as evaluated by clonogenic assay. However, knockdown of ALK by siRNA in H3122 and H2228, or overexpression of EML4-ALK in NIH-3T3 cells, had only moderate effects on radiosensitivity. Simultaneous knockdown of ALK and MET, or ALK and EGFR, increased radiosensitivity as assessed by clonogenic survival in H3122 and H2228 cells, while also increasing inhibitory effects on cell growth and proliferation. These results were confirmed in cells treated with the combination of ceritinib and su11274 (c-MET inhibitor) or with ceritinib and erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor). We further assessed the impact of drug alone or in combination with radiation on cell cycle, cell survival and DNA damage repair pathways. To further evaluate ALK function in the cellular response to radiation in NSCLC, we are developing EML4-ALK stable expression cell lines. Evaluation of drug-radiation interactions in xenograft model systems are also under consideration.These data indicate that co-inhibition of ALK and EGFR or c-MET can enhance growth inhibitory effects in ALK-positive cells and augment radiosensitivity in-vitro, suggesting the potential value for ALK inhibitors combined with EGFR/c-MET-targeting for therapeutic benefit in ALK-positive NSCLC patients with or without radiation.']",

A Phase 1 dose-escalation trial evaluating PF as an oral single agent was conducted to investigate safety, PK and PD in patients (pts) with advanced cancer (excluding leukemias). Methods', ' PF was administered under fasting conditions QD or BID on a continuous schedule to pts in successive dose-escalating cohorts at doses ranging from 50 mg QD to 300 mg BID. Pts with advanced cancer were enrolled in the study. Results', ' Thirty-seven pts were enrolled into the dose escalation part of the study.

Three DLTs were observed', ' grade 3 increase in ALT (1 pt at 200 mg QD) and grade 3 fatigue (2 pts at 300 mg BID). The most common AEs were nausea, emesis, fatigue and diarrhea. Nausea and emesis were independent of dose or duration of treatment. Mean AUC (30-57% CV) and Cmax (36-69% CV) increased proportionally with dose from 100 mg QD to 300 mg BID. The median terminal half-life was 46 hours. A 2- to 4-fold increase in the oral midazolam (MDZ) AUC was observed following 28-days of PF dosing at 100 mg QD (n = 3) and 300 mg BID (n = 2), respectively, suggesting PF to be an inhibitor of CYP3A.

        "Background":"['Current EGFR/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) combination therapies are shown to be susceptible to acquired resistance in the majority of NSCLC patients. To understand how cells develop EGFR/c-Met TKI resistance, we use three model NSCLC cell lines', ' H2170, H358 and H1975. H2170 and H358 cell lines express high levels of EGFR and c-Met and are EGFR wild-type. These cell lines were made resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib, the c-Met TKI SU11274 and a combination of both by exposure to increasing concentrations of these TKIs. The H1975 cell line is positive for two EGFR TKD mutations (T790M and L858R) which confer resistance to erlotinib.Studies have shown that EGFR/c-Met TKI resistant cells may use alternative signaling pathways to activate downstream transcription/translation proteins previously activated by EGFR and c-Met signaling. The Wnt/-catenin and mTOR pathways are demonstrated to have significant roles in cell survival, resistance and tumorigenesis in NSCLC. Several EGFR/c-Met-linked proteins in these two signaling pathways were differentially modulated in H2170 and H358 resistant lines. The Wnt signaling transducer -catenin plays a role in cellular proliferation and death and its deregulation is implicated in lung cancer. Protein kinase GSK-3 also plays an important role in lung cancer and its inhibition by Wnt results in mTOR activation. It is encoded by two genes, GSK-3 and GSK-3. GATA-6 is a transcriptional activator of Wnt and is also implicated in several cancers. Active -catenin was found to be 2 to 4-fold upreglated in H2170 SU11274-resistant (SR) cells and 2 to 20-fold upreglated in H2170 erlotinib-resistant (ER) cells, in the presence and absence of TKIs and growth factor ligands, when compared to nave H2170 cells. GATA-6 was found to be 1.5 to 4-fold upreglated in H2170 SR cells and 2 to 3-fold upreglated in H2170 ER cells. Conversely, p-GSK-3 and p-GSK-3 were found to be 1.2 to 4.8-fold and 1.5 to 10.7-fold downreglated in H2170 SR cells, respectively. These results indicate increased activation of the Wnt/-catenin and mTOR pathways in TKI resistant cells.We are currently studying the expression of these proteins further in the H1975 cell line.To translate our studies to patients, we are investigating the role of EGFR/c-Met synergism in NSCLC by conducting a retrospective biomarker analysis using IHC on 100 tissue samples from patients with stage 3 and 4 squamous cell and adenocarcinoma. Preliminary results indicate that EGFR and c-Met receptors are co-expressed in lung cancer tissues and we are acquiring data to determine how co-localization and synergism affects patient prognosis. Further studies are being conducted on proteins in the Wnt and mTOR signaling pathways, such as p70S6Kinase, mTOR, -Catenin and Axin-2, and their involvement in patient prognosis and resistance. This study may provide clinicians with novel targets for improving treatment options for future NSCLC patients.']",

        "Background":"['c-Met amplification and acquisition of a second T790M mutation are key mechanisms accounting for majority of resistant cases to first generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs; i.e., erlotinib). The third generation EGFR-TKIs (e.g., AZD9291), which selectively and irreversibly inhibit EGFR activating and T790M mutants while sparing wild-type EGFR, represent very promising therapeutic options for NSCLC patients who have become resistant to 1st generation EGFR-TKIs due to T790M mutation. However, eventual resistance to the 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs has already been described in the clinic, resulting in disease progression. Therefore, there is a great challenge and urgent need to understand how this resistance occurs and to develop effective strategies to delay or overcome the resistance. We show that c-Met amplification and hyperactivation is an universal mechanism to both 1st and 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs since both erlotinib- and AZD9291-resistant HCC827 cell lines possessed elevated levels of c-Met (due to gene amplification) and p-c-Met and were cross-resistant to AZD9291 or erlotinib. Both chemical and genetic inhibition of c-Met overcame the resistance of these cell lines to AZD9291 including enhancement of apoptosis or G1 cell cycle arrest. Consistently the combination of AZD9291 and c-Met inhibition effectively inhibited the growth of both erlotinib- and AZD9291-resistant HCC827 xenografts in nude mice. Hence, we suggest that inhibition of c-Met is also an effective strategy to overcome resistance of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs with c-Met amplification or hyperactivation to AZD9291, providing the rationale for clinical development of this novel combination strategy.

        "Background":"['NSCLC is a common cancer with the highest mortality and few effective treatment options, except for the patients with EGFR (Erlotinib, Iressa) and ALK (Crizotinib) activating mutations. Recent studies indicated that some patients with the activating EGFR mutations but without pre-exposure to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are resistant to TKIs. The proposed mechanisms (1) include', ' T790M gatekeeper mutation preventing accessing the kinase activation site, Kras mutation, pTEN loss (2), or c-met amplification (3) that activates ERBB3 signaling (4). Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models have been suggested to more closely represent patient tumors (5, 6). We established several PDXs, including HuPrime LU858, LU859, LU357, LU387, LU1901 and LU2503, using tumor tissues from individual NSCLC patients. LU858/859 contain the classic activating EGFR mutation, L858R; LU1868 contain L858R/T790M double mutations; LU357/LUF387 contain the common exon 20 insertion (2319-2320 AACCCCCAC); and LU1901/2503 have wild type EGFR. To our surprise, the two models with single L858R mutation, just like the model with double mutations, respond to the erlotinib poorly, as seen in some of clinic cases (1). Since they do not have T790M and Kras mutation, we examined them for c-met status, finding that their c-met gene are significantly amplified with also increased c-met/HGF expression as measured by at mRNA and protein levels (IHC), consistent with those seen in clinic (3). Furthermore, LU357 is sensitive to erlotinib while LU387 is not, corresponding to no c-met amplification in LU357 but significant amplification in LU387. All these suggest that the observed erlotinib resistance in these models could potentially be attributed to c-met signaling activation via c-met/HGF autocrine. To this end, we treated LU858, LU859 and LU2503 (also with c-met amplification) with c-met inhibitor, Crizotinib. Indeed, Crizotinib caused significant tumor response as expected in all these models. In particular, the combination treatment of LU858 and LU859 with erlotinib caused complete tumor regression by overcoming the resistance, suggesting a new potential effective treatment option. The results using PDX models can potentially help to design a prospective human study to demonstrate improved efficacy by the combination treatment via patient stratification to include the nave NSCLC patient subjects with c-met amplification/EGFR mutation. 1.

We studied to reveal the role of c-MET overexpression in the resistant lung cancer cell lines and to demonstrate whether MET-inhibition could restore drug sensitivity in anti-cancer drug resistant cell lines via ABC transporters down-regulation. In this study we used the 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothesin (SN-38)-resistant cell line (PC-6/SN-38) that was derived from the human SCLC cell line PC-6. We compared the expression levels of the purposed genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB). MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) assay was used to measure cell viability of the resistant cells compared with the parental cells. Inhibition of c-MET activation was performed by c-MET inhibitors, PHA665752 and Crizotinib or small interfering RNA against c-MET. We found MET inhibitors (4 or 8M) reduced cell growth and restored drug sensitivity (2M) of resistant cells, PC-6/SN38, compared to parental cells. To reveal the mechanisms of c-MET in drug resistance we examined ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters expression in PC-6/SN-38 compared to the parental cells by qRT-PCR, and found the mRNA level of ABCG2, which effluxes SN-38 as substrate, in PC-6/SN-38 cells was extremely increased and another ABC transporters that do not efflux SN-38 were not. Recently we reported PC-6/SN-38 cells had c-MET overexpression, and c-MET inhibition in resistant cells such PC-6/SN-38 resulted in restoration drug resistance. Based on this report we examined c-MET inhibition by c-MET inhibitor and small interfering RNA against c-MET in PC-6/SN38, and qRT-PCR and WB were performed to investigate alteration of ABCG2 expression, and found both two c-MET inhibition reduced ABCG2 expression. In addition, to demonstrate c-MET upregulation in resistant cells is addicted to the ligand HGF, PC-6 cells were incubated with HGF treated for 3 weeks and made PC-6/HGF, then continued to incubate with HGF and SN-38 was added two times in a week. Although c-MET expression is equal in PC-6 and PC-6/HGF, after SN-38 treatment c-MET was overexpressed. Furthermore, serum HGF level in SCLC patients correlated with clinical course. We demonstrated upregulation of ABC transporters via HGF/c-MET signaling activation might be one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to cytotoxic anticancer agents in lung cancer cells. Decreased ABC transporters expression through inhibition of c-MET activation might overcome drug resistance to cytotoxic agents.']",

        "Background":"['It is well recognized that non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients with activating EGFR mutations will develop drug resistance after receiving EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). About 20% of those patients with TKI resistance were identified to harbor Met gene amplification. The aim of this study includes two aspects', ' a) generating an acquired c-Met amplified EGFR-TKI resistant tumor line in preclinical setting, and b) exploring combination effect of c-met inhibitor volitinib and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib on the new tumor line. Volitinib is a novel, highly potent and selective c-Met inhibitor, currently being evaluated in the phase I clinical trial.HCC827(exon 19 del E746-A750), a human NSCLC cell line, was treated with increasing concentrations of EGFR inhibitor for about 6 months and gradually produced the resistance to EGFR-TKIs, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. One of the subclones, HCC827C4R was isolated and was confirmed to carry Met gene amplification in comparison to parent cell line HCC827. It was not sensitive to volitinib treatment in cell survival assay due to dual activation of EGFR and c-Met pathways. The results from signal pathway study demonstrated that in HCC827C4R cells, volitinib or gefitinib alone only inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Met or EGFR, respectively, but had no effect on the activation of downstream molecules such as Akt and ERK which drive tumor cell proliferation and other cell functions. In contrast, combination of volitinib and gefitinib significantly inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, c-Met, Akt and ERK in HCC827C4R, and consequently led to a synergistic effect on inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro. These results were further confirmed in HCC827C4R xenograft model in vivo at clinically relevant doses. Combination of volitinib and gefitinib induced significant tumor regression and displayed synergistic effect compared to treatment by either gefitinib or volitinib alone. Consistent with in vitro results, combination group strongly inhibited the downstream Akt and ERK phosphorylation. In addition, combination treatment was well tolerant and no significant drug-drug exposure interaction was observed. These data indicated that both c-Met and EGFR could contribute to activating downstream signaling pathway and control HCC827C4R cell growth. Blocking either pathway may not be strong enough to stop tumor growth.In conclusion, a cell line with activating EGFR mutation and c-Met gene amplification was generated with resistance to gefitinib and insensitivity to volitinib. The combination treatment with volitinib and an EGFR inhibitor gefitinib was highly effective in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that such combination could provide a safe and effective treatment in clinics for this particular patient population.']",

        "Background":"['The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling pathway is often dysregulated in lung cancer. We previously showed that HGF activation of c-Met in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells led to a significant induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) followed by secretion of PGE2. PGE2 caused secretion of TGF by NSCLC cells, followed by both phosphorylation of EGFR and later, delayed phosphorylation of c-Met that does not require HGF. Secretion of PGE2 also appears to boost c-Met pathway signaling downstream via cross-activation by EGFR, in a reinforcing loop that is independent of HGF. We hypothesized that targeting of both c-Met and COX-2 might lead to enhanced anti-tumor effects by blocking both upstream and downstream pro-tumor events. Maximum effects on cell proliferation, invasion and EMT markers were observed in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with combination celecoxib and crizotinib treatment. We next tested whether targeting c-Met with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib combined with celecoxib to target COX-2 would result in enhanced anti-tumor effects in an animal model with heightened HGF/c-Met pathway signaling in the airways. Mice transgenic for airway expression of human HGF were treated with the tobacco carcinogen, 4-(methylnitroso-amino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, from weeks 1-4. Crizotinib (40mg/kg), celecoxib (50mg/kg), combined crizotinib and celecoxib or placebo control was administered by oral gavage daily from week 3 until week 15, at which time lung tumors were evaluated. A highly significant decrease in the number of lung tumors per animal was observed with crizotinib treatment (mean 3.6, range 2-6), celecoxib treatment (mean 4.3, range 3-6) and combination treatment (mean 1.5, range 0-3) compared to placebo control (mean 9.9, range 6-13; P<0.001, Poisson regression). The number of tumors in the combination treatment group was also significantly lower than either single agent treatment (P<0.001). There was also a significant decrease in mean tumor size with crizotinib (mean 0.20mm2), celecoxib (mean 0.22mm2) and combination (mean 0.15mm2) compared to placebo (mean 0.38mm2, P<0.001, mixed effects modeling). Three biomarkers (COX-2, PGE2, and P-MAPK) were optimally down-modulated by combination treatment, compared to single treatment. Additionally, E-cadherin expression was up-regulated while the E-cadherin repressor, snail, was down-regulated with dual treatment. In a pulmonary environment with heightened HGF/c-Met pathway activity, dual inhibition of the c-Met and COX-2 pathways may enhance anti-tumor effects by targeting reinforcing up- and downstream signaling. Such a combination has potential clinical benefit for lung cancer patients with dysregulated c-Met/COX-2 pathways. Supported by R01 CA79882 and P50 CA090440.']",

        "Background":"[\"Lung cancer is projected to be the number one cause of cancer mortality in the United States in 2014. Therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 80-85% of all lung cancer cases. EGFR is a protein that is often targeted by these TKIs and several EGFR-TKIs have been approved for clinical use. However, NSCLC tumors almost inevitably acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs, limiting drug efficacy. Previous studies have suggested that co-localization of c-MET and EGFR may be one possible modality of acquired resistance. Additionally, upregulation of alternative signaling pathways such as Wnt or mTOR have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis and have been described as potential mechanisms of resistance. Thus, this study examined these signaling pathways and the status of EGFR/c-Met co-expression in 42 patients with stage I-IV NSCLC. Tumor tissue from biopsy or resection was obtained with patient consent and IRB approval and was subsequently processed, sectioned, and mounted on microscope slides. Total and active forms of EGFR, c-Met, mTOR, S6K, -Catenin, and Axin2 were detected using a singleplex or multiplexed immunohistochemistry staining procedure, and stains were graded by an independent pathologist using a validated scoring system. 65.9% of patients exhibited co-expression of EGFR and c-Met (n = 27) while 51.2% showed co-activation of the two markers (n = 21). Additionally, we observed EGFR/c-Met co-expression to have a statistically significant positive correlation with mTOR expression with a Spearman's rho of 0.411 (p = 0.033), suggesting EGFR/c-Met co-expression may play a role in tumorigenesis possibly via regulation of the mTOR pathway. This notion is further supported by our finding that expression of pS6K, a downstream mTOR pathway protein, showed a strong positive correlation with EGFR expression with a Spearman's rho of 0.504 (p = 0.001). In contrast, Wnt pathway protein active -Catenin exhibits a negative correlation with EGFR expression while Axin2, a negative regulator of active -Catenin, showed a positive correlation. Our findings indicate an inverse relationship between the two signaling pathways in NSCLC with increasing mTOR activation correlating with Wnt downregulation. Furthermore, EGFR expression may be associated with this relationship. Thus, we conclude that EGFR/c-Met co-expression as well as activation of the mTOR pathway may be involved in enhanced pathogenesis of NSCLC and possibly acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy.\"]",

        "Background":"['c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has hepatocyte growth factor as its ligand. Evidence from biochemical and human genetic studies indicate that c-Met is one of the most frequently activated tyrosine kinases in human cancer. Dysregulated c-Met signaling can result in the development of tumors highly dependent on c-Met. Furthermore, enhanced c-Met signaling is likely involved in conferring resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. The orally available EMD 1214063 and EMD 1204831 inhibit c-Met activity in a potent and highly selective fashion, and are currently being evaluated in cancer patients. Here we report the activity of these compounds in combination with inhibitors of EGFR and VEGF in various tumor xenograft models. EMD 1214063 was tested alone and in combination with EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib and cetuximab) in xenografts of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells, namely the lung cancer H1975 and the NCI-H441 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The H1975 cell line expresses moderate amounts of c-Met, and EMD 1214063 was inactive as a single agent (treatment group/control group [T/C] 78%; tumor growth delay [TGD] 2 days). Cetuximab was active with a T/C of 13% inducing a TGD of 21 days. The combination of EMD 1214063 and cetuximab was active with a T/C of 1% and a TGD of 42 days. The NCI-H441 cell line is characterized by constitutive c-Met overexpression and is sensitive to c-Met inhibitors in vivo. EMD 1214063 (100 mg/kg) was active inducing a T/C of 20%, while erlotinib alone (30 mg/kg) was not efficacious. However, the combination of EMD 1214063 with erlotinib enhanced tumor growth inhibition, induced partial tumor regression in 2/9 mice, and delayed tumor re-growth. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that cMet pathway activation confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors. We additionally investigated the combination of either EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 with VEGF inhibitors in NSCLC models. In NCI-H441 xenografts, EMD 1204831 produced a modest T/C (66%) at the suboptimal dose of 25 mg/kg/bid, similarly to aflibercept at 40 mg/kg (T/C 55%). In contrast, the combination of both compounds yielded a T/C of 1% with partial responses in 2/10 mice. In the EBC-1 model, treatment with EMD 1214063 (10 mg/kg) or with the antiVEGF antibody B20-4.1 (20 mg/kg) as single agents resulted in a T/C of 21% (with partial regression in 1/10 mice) and 19%, respectively. In contrast, the combination of EMD 1214063 and B20-4.1 exhibited enhanced anti-tumor activity with a T/C of 72% and partial regressions in 10/10 mice. These data support the hypothesis that EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 may be effective in NSCLC patients in combination with VEGF-targeting agents. In conclusion, our findings provide a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 with EGFR and VEGF inhibitors in NSCLC patients.']",

Tumor tissue from biopsies or resections have been obtained with IRB approval, processed, sectioned, and mounted on microscope slides. Total and active forms of EGFR, c-MET, mTOR, S6K, beta-catenin, and Axin2 were detected using singleplex or multiplex IHC staining procedures, and stains were graded by an independent pathologist using a validated scoring system. We selected Stage IV NSCLC (n = 32) patients to correlate EGFR/c-MET expression with overall survival, and analyzed them for months to mortality based on high or low EGFR expression. Patients with high EGFR expression (n = 16) showed lower overall survival compared to those with low EGFR expression (n = 16). Expression of c-MET is linked to decreased survival in Stage IV NSCLC patients (n = 4). Patients with EGFR/c-MET co-localization (n = 19) showed decreased overall survival compared to patients without EGFR/c-MET co-localization (n = 9). Elevated mTOR and p-mTOR are associated with worse prognosis in Stage IV NSCLC patients. Patients categorized with either low mTOR expression (n = 10) or high mTOR expression (n = 19) showed increased mortality with high mTOR expression (5.9 months) compared to patients with low mTOR expression (13.5 months).

Patients with low beta-catenin expression (n = 4) showed improved survival in comparison to patients with high beta-catenin expression (n = 18), 9.4 months vs 6.3 months, respectively. To determine correlations in expression of these proteins we found that EGFR/c-MET co-expression is inversely correlated with active beta-catenin and directly correlated with a negative regulator of beta-catenin, Axin-2 suggesting EGFR/c-MET co-expression is associated with a downregulation of Wnt activity. In contrast, elevated EGFR/c-MET co-expression and co-activation is statistically significantly correlated with elevated mTOR-S6K expression and activation suggesting EGFR/c-MET co-expression is associated with an upregulation of the mTOR pathway activity. Elevated mTOR pathway activation at the time of diagnosis is statistically significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with stage IV NSCLC. These preliminary results suggest that mTOR inhibition therapy in addition to EGFR/c-MET inhibition therapies may be beneficial in this population.']",

        "Background":"['Combination therapy of c-Met/EGFR TKIs against c-Met/EGFR, while initially effective, has been shown to be susceptible to acquired resistance. To establish a mechanism of TKI resistance, the NSCLC model cell lines H2170 and H358 were made resistant to the c-Met/EGFR TKIs SU11274, erlotinib, or a combination by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of inhibitors. Phospho-Met (Tyr1003) was found to be downregulated 4- and 1.5- fold in H2170 and H358 cells, respectively. Phospho-EGFR was found to be upregulated in H2170 cells and downregulated in H358 cells. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in c-Met/EGFR downstream signaling proteins, indicating that alternative signaling pathways such as the canonical Wnt pathway may confer TKI resistance. To determine differences in Wnt signaling between parental and resistant cell lines, immunoblotting was performed. In the H2170 erlotinib resistant (H2170-ER) cell line, a 5- and 6-fold increase in phospho-LRP5/6 as well as a 2- and 3-fold increase in total-LRP5/6 was observed in the presence or absence of erlotinib, respectively. Furthermore, H2170-ER cells exhibited a 3- and 16-fold increase in NKD2 as well as a 2.5- and 6-fold increase in Wnt3A in the presence or absence of EGF, respectively. A 2- to 2.5-fold increase was also observed in DVL2/3 in the absence of EGF. However, the Wnt pathway did not seem to have a significant role in H358 cells. Since EGFR and Wnt signaling are known to exhibit crosstalk, activation of the Wnt pathway may stimulate activation of EGFR causing resistance. This is suggested as upregulation of proteins involved in the Wnt pathway was seen only in the H2170 cell line. These results were confirmed by treating H2170 cells with the Wnt inhibitor XAV939. MTT analysis indicated that parental cells showed no significant response to XAV939, however, resistant cell lines showed a 2-fold decrease in viability when compared to a c-Met/EGFR TKI combination treatment. We propose a new treatment modality with Wnt inhibitors which have not yet entered clinical testing.To identify new targets for NSCLC, stable isotope labeling by heavy/light amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled with mass spectroscopy was used. Analysis revealed more than 200 proteins modulated greater than 1.5-fold, six of which have significant potential to influence cell growth and survival based on their biological roles in NSCLC. These proteins include total--catenin, TPR, syntenin, HMGB2, TOM34 and AIF. We are currently using tandem mass tagging (TMT) to further investigate additional modulated proteins. Proteins of interest identified by this method include TPD52, erbB2, MESDC2, PIN1, PEA15 and NRAS. Proteins confirmed to be upregulated/activated in resistant cell lines will be further investigated as targets which induce drug resistance in NSCLC.Citation Format', ' Ryan Jacobs, Jason Fong, David Moravec, Greg Botting, Ryan Bomgarden, John Rogers, Rosa Viner, Michael Blank, Neelu Puri.

Recent investigations suggest that aberrant activation of the c-Met receptor through c-Met amplification and/or HGF upregulation may be an additional mechanism for acquired resistance. Combination of an EGFR TKI with a c-Met inhibitor could, therefore, delay and/or prevent the emergence of c-Met-driven resistance.The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of MSC2156119J, a highly selective small molecule c-Met inhibitor, as monotherapy or in combination with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib) in human xenograft models transplanted with two different primary NSCLC explants, LU342 and LU0858. While both tumors express the activated EGFR mutant form, LU342 expresses low levels of c-Met, while LU0858 expresses high levels of c-Met and carries an amplified c-Met locus.Single-agent MSC2156119J was inactive against the low c-Met-expressing LU342 explant and tumors progressed on treatment (median tumor volume [TV] change >73%). Erlotinib treatment resulted in tumor regression, with median TV change of -93% and tumor growth delay (TGD) of 56 days. The combination of MSC2156119J and erlotinib was more active, delaying tumor regrowth by 73 days compared to erlotinib monotherapy. Administration of afatinib at 5mg/kg was highly active in this model, inducing complete tumor regression (median TV change -100%), similar to the combination of afatinib and MSC2156119J.In contrast, the LU0858 explant, which carries an amplified c-Met locus, was sensitive to MSC2156119J at a dose of 100mg/kg 5 days on and 2 days off (5 on/2 off), inducing tumor stasis with a median TV change of 19% and TGD of 34 days. While gefitinib and afatinib alone at doses of 150mg/kg 5 on/2 off and 5mg/kg 5 on/2 off, respectively, were inactive (median TV changes >73%), in combination with MSC2156119J tumor growth inhibition was enhanced, resulting in tumor regression (median TV changes of -64% and -85%, respectively). In comparison, tumors treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin 5mg/kg QW/pemetrexed 200mg/kg QW) progressed, with TGD of 16 days. When MSC2156119J was combined with cisplatin/pemetrexed, antitumor activity was not significantly enhanced compared to single-agent MSC2156119J (median TV change -32%, TGD 30 days).Together, these findings are compatible with the hypothesis that inhibition of the c-Met pathway prevents and/or delays the emergence of c-Met-driven resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Furthermore, the enhancement of antitumor activity in the low c-Met-expressing LU342 model when MSC2156119J was combined with erlotinib suggests that the combination of an EGFR TKI + MSC2156119J may also be active in tumors with low levels of c-Met expression.']",

To determine mechanisms of TKI resistance, two NSCLC model cell lines H2170 and H358 were made resistant to the c-Met/EGFR TKIs SU11274, erlotinib or a combination of both by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of inhibitor. Initial characterization of these cell lines using phospho-specific antibodies showed that phospho-c-Met was found to be downregulated 4- and 1.5- fold in SU11274-resistant (SR) H2170 and SR H358 cells, respectively. Phospho-EGFR was found to be constitutively autophosphorylated (upregulated 19-fold) in erlotinib-resistant (ER) H2170 cells, but downregulated 6-fold in ER H358 cells. Interestingly, c-Met/EGFR downstream signaling proteins p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-ERK were found to be 2-4-fold upregulated, 2-fold upregulated and 2-5-fold upregulated, respectively, in ER H2170 and H358 cells. Phospho-p70S6K was also found to be upregulated 20-fold in SR H2170 cells. These results indicate that alternative signaling pathways may confer TKI resistance in these cell lines. To identify which signaling pathways may be responsible for TKI resistance, H358 parental and resistant cell lines were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Differences in protein expression in cell lines treated with and without EGF and/or erlotinib were measured using higher multiplexing Thermo Scientific Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) reagents. More than 1500 protein groups were identified and quantified using a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion platform with HCD-MS2 and MS3 fragmentation methods. Protein expression in ER H358 cells showed a marked increase in expression of DNA replication proteins, transcription factors, apoptosis inhibitors and some Ras-associated signal transduction pathways. To further investigate the mechanism of TKI resistance, phospho-peptide enrichment was also used in combination with TMT quantitation to profile changes in protein phosphorylation state. Overall, the combination of phospho-peptide enrichment coupled with higher multiplexing TMT and high resolution MS analysis enabled deeper global profiling of TKI resistance signaling pathways compared to previous studies without enrichment.']",

However, resistance to EGFRi occurs in the majority of patients with the main clinical drivers being secondary gatekeeper mutations (T790M) or amplification of genes such as c-MET and Her2.The small animal radiation research platform (SARRP), which allows the treatment of rodent models of cancer more accurately with planned protocols similar to those utilised in the clinic, was used in combination with EGFRi, to assess the efficacy of combination treatment strategies of irradiation (IR) in EGFRi resistant NSCLC xenografts.METHODS', ' Resistance to EGFRi in the NSCLC cell line HCC827, which harbours an activating EGFR mutation, was generated through repeated exposure to Gefitinib or Erlotinib. Resistant models were characterised for further mutations in the EGFR gene by direct sequencing and for c-MET, Axl and Her2 over-expression/genomic amplification by quantitative PCR.EGFRi resistant or parental HCC827 cells were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice, xenograft growth was monitored by calliper measurements and treatment initiated when the mean tumour volume reached 200mm3.

Recent clinical studies of MET targeted therapies have used immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tissue biopsies to evaluate MET protein expression. Due to the difficulty in obtaining adequate tissue in diseases such as NSCLC, we investigated the utility of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a non-invasive method to evaluate MET status in NSCLC patients. We compared two platforms for CTC capture, CellSearch and ISET, and assessed MET expression in CTCs vs. matched bronchial biopsies in patients with advanced-stage III/IV lung adenocarcinomaDesign', ' CTC capture and MET expression in CTCs was evaluated in 358 MET positive NSCLC patients (Phase III OAM4971 trial) using the CellSearch platform. CTC capture and MET expression was evaluated in a cohort of 80 CTC-positive NSCLC patients using the ISET platform (filtration). MET was detected in CellSearch-captured CTCs by immunofluorescence using the 15A5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Genentech), and in ISET-captured CTCs and FFPE tissue sections by immunohistochemistry using the SP44 c-MET antibody from Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA. Both reagents performed equally on the CellSearch platform.Results', ' CTCs were detected in 108 of 358 (30%) patients evaluated on CellSearch, with CTC enumeration ranging from 0 to 193 CTCs/7.5 ml blood, and median 0 CTCs/7.5ml blood. Although OAM4971 patients were selected for positive MET expression in tissue, we failed to detect MET expression in most CTCs isolated by CellSearch, with 75% patients showing CTC H-score < 15. On the ISET platform, CTCs enumeration ranged from 2 to 268 CTCs/ml, with median 65 CTCs/ml. Clusters of CTCs were observed in 93% of patients, exhibiting between 1 to 23-clusters/ml blood. The MET assay on CTCs was positive in 54 of 75 (72%) patients, and the MET assay on tissue was positive in 46 of 75 (62%) patients using the onartuzumab IHC scoring algorithm*, with MET status in CTCs concordant with status in patient-matched tumor tissue.Conclusion', ' Based on our data, CTCs enumeration and MET status on CTCs from NSCLC patients captured and evaluated on the ISET system were more successful than on the CellSearch platform. On ISET, MET status in CTCs correlated strongly with MET status in tumor tissue biopsies, illustrating the potential for using CTCs as a non-invasive, real-time biopsy to determine MET status of patients entering clinical trials.

MET expression level is a potential biomarker for response to MET inhibitors. The role of MET/HGF pathway in ALK+ NSCLC is unknown.Methods. A cohort of 51 NSCLC patients tested for ALK fusion at Cleveland Clinic (2000 to 2012), including 15 ALK(+) and 36 ALK(-) subjects, were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain against MET was performed using a monoclonal CONFIRM anti-Total c-MET antibody (SP44, Ventana). Staining was performed on a Ventana Benchmark XT automated immunostainer (Ventana Medical Systems). A four-tier (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) scoring system and H-score (the sum of each intensity score x %) were used. Thirteen ALK(+) patients treated on crizotinib therapy were prospectively followed and a total of 32 blood plasma samples were collected (1) prior to crizotinib initiation, (2) during responding period and (3) at disease progression, for HGF level measurement using HGF ELISA kit (R&D). Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test in JMP.Results. Of the 51 tumor tested for MET IHC, 39 were adenocarcinoma (15 ALK+ and 24 ALK-), 6 squamous cell, 4 large cell carcinoma and 2 other NSCLC. None received any MET inhibitor when tissue was collected. The percentage of negative MET IHC (score 0 or 1+ in 50% tumor cells) was not statistically significant between ALK(+) and ALK(-) groups (40% vs 30%, p=0.5). The plasma HGF levels in ALK(+) patients varies from undetectable to 14000pg/ml. The median (25th-75th quantiles) level in patients prior to crizotinib therapy (n=5), during responding period (CR/PR/SD, n=12) and at disease progression (n=5) were 2137(767-12100)pg/ml, 1629(785-3430)pg/ml and 4064(1108-7308)pg/ml. The plasma HGF level showed a trend of decreasing during clinical response to crizotinib and elevation upon disease progression, albeit not reaching statistical significance in this small study cohort (p>0.05).Conclusions. MET expression is commonly seen in NSCLC, and no significant difference were observed between fusion ALK(+) and ALK(-) NSCLC. The baseline plasma HGF concentration varied significantly among ALK(+) NSCLC patients, but showed a trend correlating with therapeutic response and resistant progression, to crizotinib therapy.

EMD1214063 is a small molecule inhibitor that suppresses the kinase activity of Met. The current study investigated the potential of EMD1214063 (provided by EMD Serono Merck Inc) in enhancing cancer cell sensitivity to radiation.Materials and Methods', ' Three NSCLC lines (A549, H460 and H1993) and three HNSCC lines (FaDu, HN-5 and UMSCC-1) with different levels of Met protein were used for the study. The effects of EMD1214063 on Met expression, cell viability, migration and cell radiosensitivity were assessed. Various scheduling effect on the magnitude of increased cell radiosensitivity was evaluated. 53BP1 foci formation was assayed for DNA repair kinetics. In vivo tumor growth delay assays on two NSCLCs and two HNSCCs generated in mice were performed to test the efficacy of EMD1214063 on tumor growth and tumor response to radiation.Results', ' NSCLC lines expressed higher levels of Met than HNSCC lines. EMD1214063 reduced survival of NSCLC lines markedly and had a minimal effect on HNSCC lines in vitro. Western blots showed three major Met protein bands with molecular weights of about 145 kDa, 60 kDa and 45 kDa. Radiation increased the expression levels of the 145 kDa and 60 kDa fragments of Met in a dose dependent manner. EMD1214063 suppressed the radiation-induced expression of Met and prolonged the presence of 53BP1 foci. It potently enhanced the radiosensitivity of A549, H1993, HN-5 and FaDu but not that of H460 and UMSCC-1. The enhancement factors at the survival fraction of 0.5 ranged from 1.11 to 2.24, with H1993 being the most responsive cell line. In vivo data showed lack of single agent activity of EMD1214063 on the growth of tumor xenografts tested (A549, H460 and FaDu).

Moreover IHC and FISH was also performed on the specimens of MET exon 14 mutational patients. Results', ' 826 of them were detected by NGS and 275 by sanger sequencing. A total of 10 patients have been identified with MET exon 14 mutations which accounted for only 0.91% of lung adenocarcinoma, much less than the western patients data of 3%. Then 6 of MET exon 14 mutational patients have been performed with IHC and FISH. All the detailed data has been presented in Table 1. Furthermore among 2 patients received crizotinib, only 1 patient combined with MET amplification experienced a partial response and PFS has been 9 months. However whether sensitivity to crizotinib in this patient was conferred by the MET exon 14 mutation or by MET amplification is still unclear. For the other one, the disease has progressed in only 1.0 month.

        "Background":"['The development of therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis, tumor driver gene alterations and tumor immune evasion has made tremendous advancement in improving overall survival. However, efficacy may be limited and resistance often develops rapidly when targeting a single axis of tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore rational combination of therapies based on tumor-specific features. Fruquintinib is a potent and selective oral VEGFR inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). We report here the evaluation of anti-tumor effect of fruquintinib in preclinical animal tumor models in combination with therapies targeting tumor driver gene alterations such as EGFR and c-MET or with immune checkpoints. In NSCLC xenograft models with EGFR activation such as activating mutations, gene amplification or protein overexpression, fruquintinib plus an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as gefitinib or theliatinib (HMPL-309) was found to be more efficacious than either monotherapy. For instance, in PC-9 subcutaneous tumor model carrying EGFR exon 19 deletion, single agent treatment with fruquintinib at 2 mg/kg and gefitinib at 5 mg/kg produced the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 58% and 63%, respectively, while the combination treatment resulted in a TGI of 100% and tumor regression was observed in 11 of 16 mice treated with combinational therapy. In multiple xenograft models derived from lung cancer or renal cell cancer with c-MET activation (amplification or over-expression), addition of fruquintinib to a c-MET inhibitor savolitinib (AZD6094, HMPL-504) also improved the tumor growth inhibition substantially. At the end of the efficacy studies, CD31 and phosphorylation of EGFR, c-MET, AKT and ERK were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and western blotting method in tumor tissues. The results suggested that the enhanced anti-tumor effect in combination therapy could be attributed to the simultaneous blockade of cell signaling in tumor cells (EGFR or c-MET) and VEGFR suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Up-regulation of the immune inhibitory checkpoints induced by VEGF is one of the important mechanisms for tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. In a syngeneic murine tumor model, co-administration of fruquintinib and anti-PD-L1 antibody was found to provide improved anti-tumor effect compared to fruquintinib or anti-PD-L1 single agent alone. Studies to understand the mechanism responsible for the combination effect are under way. All combinations with fruquintinib described above were well tolerated. The efficacy observed in these models suggested that simultaneous blockade of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell signaling or immune evasion may be a promising approach in improving treatment outcomes.']",

Platinum-based combination regimen or molecular target drugs, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and ALK inhibitors are used for first line chemotherapy of NSCLC. Somatic mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been identified in NSCLC and those mutations confer sensitivity to the EGFR-TKIs such as gefitinib. Unfortunately, it is well known that the almost cases are developed to drug resistance after chemotherapy. Several EGFR-TKI resistant mechanisms have been reported, including gatekeeper mutation (T790M), c-MET amplification and ErbB3 activation. Re-biopsy is generally required for determine the resistance mechanism and second line chemotherapy. However, re-biopsy is invasive test for cancer patients. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) are paid attention as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and sensitivity to chemotherapy in various cancers. In the previous study, we revealed that the miRNA biosynthesis pathway is critical for maintain the cisplatin resistant phenotype. Further, it was reported that EGFR modulated microRNA maturation through the phosphorylation of AGO2. Protein phosphorylation is one of most important post transcriptional modification mechanisms and miRNA is also associated with fine tuning of mRNA expression. Thus, we focused on the relationship between miRNA expression and kinase signaling in gefitinib resistance. In this study, we performed characterization of gefitinib resistant cell lines, PC-9/MET200 and PC-9/MET1000 established from NSCLC cell line, PC-9, which were confirmed to have a c-MET amplification using miRNA microarray and quantitative PCR. Furthermore, we analyzed miRNA activity and kinase signaling using a luciferase reporter assay system, siRNA, RTK/phosphokinase protein array and kinase inhibitors. We revealed that miR-205 was significantly elevated in both gefitinib resistant cell lines. By the computational analysis using miRNA target prediction database, we found that ErbB3 was a target of miR-205. However, ErbB3 expression levels were rather up-regulated and highly phosphorylated in both resistant cell lines compared with a parental cell line. Under ErbB3 knockdown condition, miR-205 expression levels were slightly down regulated. Furthermore, under c-MET knockdown or Foretinib treatment condition, miR-205 activity were down regulated and ErbB3 dephosphorylated in resistant cell lines. This down-regulation of miR-205 appears to be mediated by inhibition of kinase signals. Moreover, we found that some kinase inhibitors suppressed miR-205 activity in gefitinib resistant cell lines. In conclusion, our results suggest that alterations of kinase signals are more effective for miR-205 regulation than protein expression of target molecule itself, such as ErbB3.']",

The H1975 cell line is positive for two EGFR TKD mutations, T790M and L858R, which confer resistance to erlotinib.Previous studies in our lab have shown that activation of alternative signaling pathways lead to the development of TKI resistance. In the wild type TKI resistant cells, H2170 erlotinib resistant (ER) and H2170 SU11274 resistant(SR), we observed activation of Wnt and mTOR pathway along with increased accumulation of -catenin in the nucleus. However, in H1975 cells with mutated EGFR (L858R and T790M), we observed activation of only mTOR pathway. -catenin is associated with Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), during which cells lose tight junction proteins such E-Cadherin and gain expression of transcriptional proteins such as -catenin and ZEB1, which may lead to aberrant activation of Wnt signaling pathway and increased motility and invasion. Activation of mTOR pathway leads to increased expression of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 which are key translational regulators.We found increased accumulation of active -catenin in the nucleus by 1.9-2.5 folds and 2.9-3.1 folds in H2170 ER and SR cells, respectively, compared to H2170 parental cells. In H2170 ER cells we observed modulations in key EMT-related proteins, N-Cadherin (2-3.3 fold) and Claudin-1 (2.5-14 fold) were upregulated and Snail was downregulated 1.7-2.5 fold in the presence and absence of erlotinib and EGF, when compared to H2170 parental cells. Similarly in H2170 SR cells we observed upregulation of N-Cadherin (1.3-2.3 fold) and Zeb-1 (1.2-1.4 fold) and downregulation of ZO-1 (1.4-1.9 fold) and E-Cadherin (1.5-2.0 fold) in the presence and absence of HGF and SU11274 when compared to H2170 parental cells. Morphological changes indicative of EMT were detected using immunostaining with Vimentin and E-Cadherin antibodies, which displayed increased Vimentin filaments (2-fold) and loss of E-Cadherin (5-10 fold) in H2170 ER cells when compared to H2170 parental cells. In H1975 cells we observed that proteins related to mTOR signaling pathway such as p-mTOR, p-GSK3-, p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K were upregulated 2.5 fold, 4-5 fold, 2.2-2.4 fold, and 4.4-10.4 fold, respectively, when compared to H3255 cells in the presence of erlotinib. Based on these results, we treated H1975 cells with combination of EGFR and mTOR inhibitors. We observed that 1 M everolimus with 2.5 M erlotinib synergistically inhibited cell growth by 53%. These studies may provide clinicians with novel targets for improving treatment options for future NSCLC patients.']",

Results', ' 167 pts were randomized to E+A (84 pts) or E+P (83 pts). Mean age was 63 yrs and baseline characteristics were well balanced for sex (39%/41% F); race (93%/96% white) and smoking history (20%/22% never smoker). Imbalances were seen among treatment arms in NSCLC histology (54%/64% adeno) and predictive molecular genotypes', ' EGFR mutations (7%/13%) and k-RAS mutations (12%/6%).

Most NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations will respond to EGFR-TKIs; however, in about 50% of these cases a secondary mutation in EGFR (T790M) subsequently occurs which results in resistance to treatment. Other mechanisms of clinical resistance can also occur such as amplification of c-MET kinase, Her-2 and EMT conversion; however, additional routes of resistance are poorly defined. Using a novel NSCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, driven by the L858R EGFR mutation, we set out to recapitulate the reported clinical routes of resistance to EGFR inhibitors and to evaluate if additional mechanism could also be identified.Methods', ' LU6422 is a Caucasian NSCLC adenocarcinoma PDX model with an activating EGFR mutation (L858R) which is maintained subcutaneously in vivo admixed with a human stromal cell component. HCC827 is NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell line with an activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 del E746-A750).Resistant models of LU6422 and HCC827 were generated in vivo and in vitro (respectively) through repeated dosing or exposure to EGFR-TKIs. Resistant tumour material was characterised for further mutations in the EGFR gene by direct sequencing and for c-MET, Axl and Her2 over-expression and genomic amplification by quantitative PCR. Combination efficacy treatment (in vitro and in vivo) was carried out to verify documented resistance mechanisms.Results', ' Nave LU6422 and HCC827 tissue exhibited exquisite sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs (100% reduction in pre-treatment tumour volume, p<0.0001).

It has been identified as an oncogenic driver in various malignancies and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population. Future studies should incorporate MET CISH in clinical trials utilizing MET-targeted agents to determine its potential as a predictive test for evaluating who may derive the most benefit.']",

Volitinib is a potent (IC50 4 nM) and selective (>650 fold selectivity over 265 kinases), small molecule inhibitor of MET. Recent evaluation of Volitinib across a panel of cancer cell lines demonstrated selectivity for MET-driven disease, with MET amplified cell lines being most sensitive (IC50s of 1nM) and also suggesting limited off target activity. Volitinib resistant cell lines with MET amplification were identified and used to better understand the relationship of concurrent mutations with response. In addition to cancer cell line selectivity, we are analyzing preclinical models of NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) that are representative of key patient segments, namely MET amplification and over expression. In newly diagnosed NSCLC adenocarcinomas, focal MET amplification events represent 3% of the population while over expression of MET (without gene amplification) is observed in the majority of patients. In preclinical models, focal Met amplification in EBC-1 and NCI-H1993 caused significant tumor growth inhibition, confirming sensitivity to Volitinib. Given the prevalence of over expression in NSCLC, however, we sought to build a platform of evidence for the therapeutic use of Volitinib in preclinical models lacking amplification of the MET gene. Using a patient-derived xenograft model (PDX) of EGFR WT, KRAS WT and metastatic NSCLC disease (HLXF-036LN), we demonstrate that Volitinib induces tumor regression as monotherapy and has added therapeutic benefit when used in combination with taxotere. In addition, we show robust efficacy effects for additional preclinical models, LG0567, LG0645 and Calu-3, for either Volitinib alone or in combination with taxotere. In parallel pharmacodynamic studies, we demonstrate that Volitinib inhibits p-MET and downstream signaling in each model. Together, using an integrated platform of molecular characterization and MET FISH and IHC scores, corresponding antitumor responses to Volitinib are being evaluated for several patient segments. We are using these studies to inform the design of patient selection criteria for upcoming clinical trials in NSCLC.']",

Methods', ' From Jan 1st 2014 to Dec 31st 2015, we screened 149 consecutive NSCLC patients for the presence of MET overexpression concomitant EGFR mutation. MET overexpression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in which  50% tumor cells with moderate to high intensity staining were defined as MET positive. MET amplification was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and FISH positive was defined as gene focal amplification or high polysomy (at least 15% cells with  5 copy numbers). Meanwhile, EGFRmutations were tested by DNA sequencing or Scorpion amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). Results', ' The frequency of concomitant MET overexpression and EGFR mutation was 38.9% (58/149) in advanced NSCLC. However, the frequency of MET amplification was 13.6% (6/44). The frequency of primary resistance to EGFR TKIs was 24.1% (14/58) in EGFR/MET-coexisted patients and 14.2% (13/91) in those with only EGFR mutations, P= 0.13.

The MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is often co-expressed with EGFR in the NSCLC cells, and is an important alternative resistant mechanism for escaping EGFR-targeted therapy. To assess the benefit of dual blockage of MET and EGFR for NSCLC therapy, we investigated the activities of these two RTK pathways in several NSCLC cell lines carrying distinct cellular contexts, and determined their responses to SGX523 and erlotinib, the small molecule kinase inhibitors of MET and EGFR, respectively. Here, we showed that MET can cross-activate EGFR in MET-amplified or overexpressing cells via hetero-receptor dimerization, and the MET-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR can be abolished by SGX523 but not by erlotinib. More importantly, combined inhibition of MET and EGFR in vitro results in a maximal suppression of downstream ERK and AKT activation and of cell proliferation when their ligands (HGF and EGF) are present. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SGX523 and erlotinib combination strengthens anti-cancer activity in vivo in a cellular context-dependent manner. The combination led to regression of MET-amplified H1993 tumors by enhancing suppression of proliferation and inducing apoptosis, whereas significantly reduced MET-non-amplified H1373 tumor growths by suppression of proliferation without inducing apoptosis. Although SGX523 alone was sufficient to achieve near complete regression of MET-addicted EBC-1 tumors, its combination with erlotinib strongly inhibited viability of a population of SGX523-insensitive cells emerging from SGX523-treated EBC-1 tumor relapse. Our data suggest that dual blockage of MET and EGFR can enhance anti-cancer effects on NSCLC in a context-dependent manner, and provide a strong rationale and mechanisms for combining MET and EGFR inhibitors for NSCLC therapy.']",

We also determined the genetic variations of CBL, their relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as EGFR and MET, and their functionality in NSCLC. However, ubiquitination of EGFR showed no difference between CBL wild type (WT) and mutants (Mts). Therefore, we undertook to investigate whether MET is a potential target of CBL and better therapeutic strategy.Materials/ Methods', ' CBL alterations were determined in NSCLC patients with next generation sequencing. Immunoprecipitation was performed to detect the ubiquitination of MET by CBL WT and Mts. MET inhibitor SU11274 was utilized to compare cell viability of CBL WT cells with viability of CBL Mt cells. Cell motility after SU11274 treatment was examined by wound healing assay. Soft agar assay was performed to investigate colony formation of shRNA knockdown (sh-CBL) cells and SU11274 treatment.

        "Background":"['The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) are receptor tyrosine kinases that each plays a key role in cancer signaling.Co-expression and activation of MET and EGFR are found in a number of tumor types, including non-small cell lung, colorectal, gastric, and head and neck cancers (Nanjo et al. 2013). Blocking one receptor tends to up-regulate the other, leading to resistance to single-agent treatment (Engelman et al. 2007). Amplification of MET and/or high levels of HGF expression has been observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with intrinsic or acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR (Engelman et al. 2007; Yano et al. 2011). Conversely, MET-amplified lung cancer cells exposed to MET-inhibiting agents for a prolonged period develop resistance via the EGFR pathway (McDermott et al. 2010). The crosstalk between the MET and EGFR pathways suggests that dual inhibition of these targets may lead to improved outcomes for patients with MET- and EGFR-positive cancers, and that simultaneous inhibition may overcome or delay resistance compared to the blockade of just a single pathway. LY3164530 is an engineered mAb-scFv bispecific antibody that consists of an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody to MET and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to EGFR fused to the N-terminus of each heavy chain (HC). LY3164530 binds to extracellular domains of MET and EGFR with high affinity and inhibits signaling via both MET and EGFR receptors by blocking ligand binding and internalizing and degrading both receptors. In tumor cells, it binds and co-immunoprecipitates both receptors. LY3164530 has increased avidity binding to MET in cells expressing higher level of EGFR. This increased avidity binding leads to better neutralization of HGF compared to parental MET antibody in these cells. Surprisingly, LY3164530 has superior activity in internalizing/degrading EGFR (wild type and mutant forms) in vitro and in vivo relative to the combination of LY2875358 (i.e., emibetuzumab) and cetuximab in cells expressing high MET and EGFR. In addition, LY3164530 has superior activity in overcoming HGF-mediated resistance to erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, or vemurafenib as compared to the combination of individual monoclonal antibodies targeting these receptors in cell-based assays. In vivo, administration of LY3164530 results in dose-dependent antitumor activity in multiple cell line-derived NSCLC and gastric xenografts. The antitumor activity of LY3164530 is equivalent, and in some cases superior to the combination of emibetuzumab and cetuximab in NSCLC and gastric tumor models.

Deletion of this exon results in sustained activation of MET and its downstream signaling pathways. The diverse splice site mutations leading to exon 14 skipping comprise a unique and unprecedented class of RTK activating mutations and the molecular mechanism by which these genetic alterations transform cancer cells is not fully understood. One major challenge in understanding the utility of MET inhibition of the METex14del class has been the lack of available pre-clinical models.In the present study, we generated and characterized multiple METex14del-driven cancer models to study the mechanism of MET-dependent cellular transformation as well as the response to MGCD265, a small molecule inhibitor of MET and AXL. METex14del models were identified via mining patient-derived xenograft (PDX) databases or were engineered using genome editing techniques to generate isogenic pairs of METex14del and WT cell lines.The METex14del cell lines formed increased size and number of colonies in anchorage independent growth assays compared to their WT counterparts. The transformation of METex14del cells was associated with an increase in durable HGF-dependent activation of MET and downstream signaling pathways potentially due to dysregulated MET processing and signaling attenuation.

When evaluated in the amplified METex14del-driven gastric xenograft model Hs746T, significant tumor regression was observed following MGCD265 treatment. In addition, MGCD265 demonstrated substantial regression of large established tumors, in two novel NSCLC METex14del-positive PDX models.Together, these data confirm METex14del mutations are bona fide oncogenic drivers and sensitive to targeted therapeutics. Moreover, the models described in this study represent a relevant pre-clinical platform to further study receptor hyper-activation and drug action that is clinically actionable.

Previously, several small sample size studies have revealed a higher frequency in pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) than other types of NSCLC. In order to reveal the accurate frequency of MET gene alterations in Chinese PSCs, we comprehensively studied the frequency and the relationship among MET exon 14, protein expression and amplification in a large cohort of PSCs. Methods', ' MET exon 14, protein expression and amplification were detected in 148 surgically resected PSC samples from multiple medical centers by using Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively. Results', ' MET exon 14 was identified in 9 (6.1%) of 148 cases. Six were pleomorphic carcinoma, two were spindle cell carcinoma and one was carcinosarcoma. MET exon 14 was more common in pleomorphic carcinoma compared with other subtypes of PSCs (p = 0.01, X2 test) and have an obvious tendency to occur in elder patients. MET protein overexpression was detected in 16.2% (24/148) of PSCs, and was found significantly associated with MET exon 14 (p = 0.045). MET FISH positive was detected in 15.5% (23/148), and 6 (4.1%) of them were confirmed as gene amplifications. MET FISH positivity (P < 0.001, X2 test) and amplification (P < 0.001, X2 test) were significantly associated with the IHC positive.

Here we examined whether Cripto1, which has been shown to induce EMT, could cause erlotinib resistance. We show that innate erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinomas carrying sensitizing EGFR mutations exhibit higher level of Cripto1 expression than their erlotinib sensitive counterparts. Ectopic expression of Cripto1 rendered erlotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma cells resistant to erlotinib both in vitro and in a xenograft model. Moreover, Cripto1 activated Zeb1/EMT signaling pathway in EGFR-TKI resistant cells. High Cripto1 expression correlated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients.

Inappropriate activation of MET can be induced by HGF-independent mechanisms such as gene amplification, specific genetic mutations, and transcriptional up-regulation, or by HGF-dependent autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.

LY2875358 has high neutralization and internalization activities against MET for inhibiting HGF-dependent and HGF-independent MET pathway activation and tumor growth. In HGF-dependent MET activation, LY2875358 blocks HGF binding to MET, HGF-induced MET phosphorylation and tumor growth both in cell culture and in mouse xenograft models, resembling activities of a humanized one-armed 5D5 MET antibody (monovalent antibody similar to Onartuzumab). In tumors with HGF-independent MET activation through MET gene amplification, LY2875358 induces internalization and degradation of MET, which results in decreased pMET and total MET, inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor growth in MKN45 and SNU5 gastric tumor lines and EBC-1 and H1993 NSCLC tumor lines. Moreover, LY2875358 enhances antitumor activity in combination with cisplatin or 5-FU in vitro and in vivo in MET amplified tumor cells.

When HGF is added to tumor cells with high MET gene amplification, LY2875358 decreases cell proliferation, while the one-armed 5D5 antibody does not. In contrast to other bivalent MET antibodies, LY2875358 has no or otherwise negligible agonist activity and does not stimulate biological activities such as cell proliferation, scattering, invasion, tubulogenesis, apoptosis protection or angiogenesis in various HGF responsive cells. These findings indicate that LY2875358 has a different mechanism of action from the humanized one-armed 5D5 MET antibody.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is a leading cause of deaths from cancer among men and women worldwide with an estimated 1.5 million deaths each year. Available molecularly targeted therapies benefit a limited number of patients and even in these patients acquired resistance is a major impediment to effective therapeutic response. To address the need for additional therapeutic targets, we used a unique approach to identify and target tumor-stroma paracrine crosstalk pathways in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).To explore paracrine crosstalk in NSCLC, we analyzed transcriptomes of specific stromal and epithelial compartments that were sorted from Kras driven mouse model of NSCLC. Transcriptome analysis and computational modeling of multi-cellular network identified potential tumor-stroma crosstalk signaling pathways. We have selected the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathway because both HGF and MET are associated with poor survival in many cancer types including lung cancer. Notably, we identified reprogrammed intratumoral macrophages as unique source of HGF, while the expression of MET receptor was confined to tumor epithelial compartment. Importantly, we have observed elevated HGF in chemoresistant tumors both in mouse and human. Previous studies have implicated MET receptor amplification or mutations as the main mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, but little is known about the contribution of HGF ligand-dependent activation of MET signaling in NSCLC growth and resistance to chemotherapeutic regimens that are widely used. We have used a combination of culture experiments and in vivo genetic approaches to show that macrophage-derived HGF interacts with the MET receptor on tumor epithelial cells in a paracrine fashion, to activate downstream signaling pathways that promote tumor progression and mediate resistance to standard chemotherapies. Our investigations on this relatively unexplored HGF-MET paracrine interaction as a key mechanism of resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic regimens-and not just EGFR targeted therapies-have the potential to benefit the NSCLC population as whole rather than a small subset of patients.']",

We performed proliferation and clonogenic survival assays using the low MET-expressing H460 and A549 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, the high MET-expressing H441 NSCLC cell line and the MET-dependent GTL16 gastric cancer cell line. Activity against the MET receptor and Aurora B kinase was assessed by analyzing the phosphorylation status of MET Tyr1234/1235 and Histone H3 Ser10 residues. Pharmacologic and RNA interference approaches against Aurora B and MET were used to determine the molecular mechanism of the cell response to S49076.S49076 inhibited MET activity in the nanomolar range (1 - 100 nM). At higher, but still clinically-relevant concentrations (0.5 - 1 M), S49076 was also found to inhibit Aurora B kinase activity in all cell lines tested. In non MET-dependent cell lines, the antiproliferative and anti-clonogenic effects of the drug correlated with its activity against Aurora B, whereas in the MET-dependent cell line, these effects could be attributed to direct inhibition of the MET receptor. When treatment with S49076 was combined with IR, an enhancement of IR effects was observed in all cell lines tested in vitro. In vivo, a significant growth delay of subcutaneous tumors was observed at 50 mg/kg bid oral S49076 in non-MET dependent models and at 3 mg/kg bid oral S49076 in the GTL16 MET-dependent model. For non MET-dependent models, immunohistochemistry revealed that treatment with S49076 reduced Histone H3 phosphorylation on Ser10. This is consistent with the finding that S49076 concentrations above 1 M were attained in the tumors, as determined by LC-MS/MS analysis. In all tumors tested, S49076 treatment significantly delayed tumor growth when combined to a fractionated IR (4 fractions of 2.5 Gy) compared to IR alone. An orthotopic model of lung cancer using luciferase-expressing H460 NSCLC cells was also used to evaluate the combination of S49076 (50mg/kg bid) and locally fractionated thoracic IR (4*2.5 Gy). In this model, the median survival after cell implantation was 22 days for control mice, 29.5 and 29 days for S49076 treated and irradiated mice respectively and 41 days for mice receiving the combined treatment (p<0.002 for combined treatment versus the irradiated arm or the S49076 treated arm).Our findings indicate that S49076 improves the efficacy of radiotherapy in both MET- and non-MET- dependent cell, supporting the use of combined treatment with S49076 and radiation in clinical trials without patient selection.']",

Amplification or mutations in MET lead to increased activity of downstream pathways including PI3K and MAPK, eventually resulting in tumor formation. Several small molecule inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, including the selective inhibitor Savolitinib (HMP-504, Volitinib, AZD6094), which shows single digit nanomolar activity in MET-amplified cell lines. Newly emerging data suggest mutations in MET causing complete skipping of Exon 14 occur in approximately 4% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and are more rare in other indications [1, 2]. MET exon 14 skipping mutations were shown to be mutually exclusive from EGFRm, ALK and KRAS and can occur in the context of MET gene amplification [3]. Exon 14 harbors the CBL binding site (Y1003), which is critical for receptor degradation after binding of its ligand, HGF, and suppression of downstream signaling events. Clinical trial results with less potent, pan RTK inhibitors Crizotinib (31nM GI50 vs 3nM for Savolitinib) and Cabozantinib show promising early results, but fall short in long term responses. Therefore, better therapies targeting MET are needed. Human cell line models with Exon 14 deletions are rare. Therefore, we used engineered cell lines to test the effect of Savolitinib on these mutations. To do this, we expressed MET-Y1003F mutants in NIH-3T3 and HEK293T cells. We found that Savolitinib potently inhibited phospho-MET in both models expressing this mutant (100% phospho-MET inhibition). In addition, we tested whether or not Savolitinib could inhibit HGF-dependent signaling and growth of a NSCLC cell line, NCI-H596. In the presence of FBS (10%), Savolitinib had no effect on the growth rate of these cells, however was highly efficient at blocking HGF-dependent growth in the absence of FBS. To test the effect of this mutation in the background of amplification, we also tested the gastric cancer cell line Hs746T, which harbors exon 14 skipping in addition to MET amplification. Savolitinib was highly efficacious at blocking the growth of this cell line. Future studies are aimed at looking at the in vivo effect of Savolitinib targeting exon 14 mutants.

Studies further indicated that miRNA down-regulates expression of CDK7, RB1, AKT, FASL, IGF1R, EGFR and N-cadherin and up-regulates expression of P21 and E-cadherin. MiRNA regulated genes were responsible for cell cycle arrest, enhanced apoptosis and decreased metastasis.

The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated survival improvements with low dose CT (LD-CT) screening in persons at high lung cancer risk (age 55-74 with 30 pack-years [pys] of smoking). We examined the age and smoking histories of HIV+ LCa patients to determine who would have met NLST screening eligibility.  Methods', '  The Cancer Registry (42,967 cancer cases) and the HIV Integrated Clinical Database (14,927 HIV+s) at Montefiore Medical Center  Einstein (Bronx, NY) were linked to identify HIV+ cancer cases between 2000-2012. Chart review was performed for those with LCa.  Results', '  Of the 935 invasive cancers in HIV+s, 90 (9.6%) were LCa (62% men, 38% women). Histology was 11% small cell, 20% squamous and 37% adenocarcinoma, 2% large cell, and remaining 30% were classified as non-small cell carcinomas. Median age at LCa diagnosis was 54 years ([y]; range', ' 2472), with 2% <35y, 52% 35-54y, 46% 55y. 4% were never smokers, and 3% had <15pys, 24% 15-29pys, 68% 30pys. Overall, 66 cases (73%) did not meet NLST age or smoking criteria. Most cases (85%) had been followed for HIV care. The median CD4+ was 238 cells/L, and median HIV viral load was 81 copies/mL. LCa was stage I in 8%, stage II in 11%, stage III in 23%, and stage IV in 58%. All stage I/II cases underwent surgical resection.  Conclusions', '  Most HIV+ LCa cases failed to meet NLST criteria for LD-CT screening due to age <55y or pys <30. If LD-CT is to be utilized in this high-risk population, age and smoking thresholds may need to be lowered.

        "Background":"['Signaling through the MET receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), promotes cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Activation of MET signaling is a relatively common hallmark of a diverse range of human cancer types, and as a result, inhibition of MET signaling represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of cancer. In this study, we describe the characterization of AMG 337, a potent and highly selective small molecule ATP-competitive MET kinase inhibitor that demonstrates robust activity in MET-dependent cancer models.In enzymatic assays, AMG 337 inhibited MET kinase activity with an IC50 of < 5nM nM. AMG 337 demonstrated exquisite selectivity for MET when profiled against a diverse panel of over 400 protein and lipid kinases in a competitive binding assay. In cellular assays, AMG 337 inhibited HGF-dependent MET phosphorylation with an IC50 of < 10 nM. To identify predictive genomic markers of response, AMG 337 was profiled in cell viability assays using a diverse panel of over 200 cancer cell lines. Treatment with AMG 337 only affected the viability of two gastric cancer cell lines (SNU-5 and Hs746T), both of which harbor amplification of the MET gene. The AMG 337 IC50 in the two sensitive cell lines was < 50 nM, and > 10 M in all other tested cell lines.Further studies in an expanded panel of additional cancer cell lines derived from gastric, NSCLC, and esophageal cancer confirmed that the in-vitro anti-proliferative activity of AMG 337 correlated with amplification of MET. In those cell lines, treatment with AMG 337 inhibited downstream PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, which translated into growth arrest as evidenced by an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, a concomitant reduction in DNA synthesis, and the induction of apoptosis.In vivo, oral administration of AMG 337 resulted in robust dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in MET amplified gastric cancer xenograft models, with inhibition of tumor growth consistent with the pharmacodynamic modulation of MET signaling.In conclusion, these findings illustrate the potential clinical utility of AMG 337 as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of tumors with evidence of dysregulated MET signaling, including MET amplification. A phase 1 clinical study is currently evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinectics of AMG 337 in patients with solid tumors.']",

        "Background":"['Although a large fraction of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are dependent on defined oncogenic driver mutations, little progress has been made in the treatment of patients with the most frequently observed driver mutation, mutant KRAS. Acquired resistance to therapy targeting other driver mutations (EGFR mutant and ALK translocation positive tumors) is all but inevitable. We recently demonstrated that Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, cooperates with mutant Kras to induce lung adenocarcinoma in mouse models, and that inhibition of Twist1 in murine models and human lung cancer cell lines led to oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and in some cases, apoptosis. We have also found that TWIST1 is essential for tumor maintenance in human NSCLCs characterized by oncogenic drivers including KRAS mutation, EGFR mutation and c-MET amplification. As TWIST1 is not typically expressed post-natally, therapies directed against TWIST1 may present a more specific and perhaps less toxic therapy. Targeting the TWIST1 pathway represents an exciting and novel therapeutic strategy which may have a significant clinical impact.We employed a combined bioinformatics-chemical approach to identify pharmacologic inhibitors of TWIST1. We used gene expression profiles from several KRAS mutant human NSCLC cell lines following shRNA-mediated TWIST1 knockdown to perform connectivity map (CMAP) analysis. We found that several of our highly ranked compounds had significant growth inhibitory effects in NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, several of our candidate agents produced dose-dependent inhibition of TWIST1-induced dissemination in a novel 3D organoid dissemination assay. Interestingly, a family of related harmala alkaloids including harmine ranked highly on the CMAP analysis. We found that harmine could not only inhibit growth in several oncogene driver defined NSCLC cell lines through the induction of apoptosis but could also decrease TWIST1 levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism. The growth inhibitory effects of the harmala alkaloids correlated with the ability to degrade TWIST1. Additionally, independent of our CMAP analysis, we identified another compound, salinomycin, which appears to modulate cancer cell growth and resulted in a decrease in TWIST1 levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism as well. Interestingly, salinomycin treatment induced a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) in NSCLC which could be partially blocked in TWIST1 overexpressing NSCLC cell lines. We are currently examining the in vivo efficacy of these agents. In conclusion, we have identified several compounds that inhibit TWIST1 dependent dissemination and in some cases can lead to TWIST1 degradation. Since TWIST1 is essential for not only KRAS mutant NSCLC but more broadly for oncogene driven NSCLC, these studies could lead to the development of a novel class of inhibitors which could have a significant clinical impact.']",

However, it is recognized that, clinically, drug resistance eventually emerges and this limits the mean duration of response. Although mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI, such as T790M secondary mutation and MET amplification, have recently been described, other mechanisms of resistant to EGFR-TKI should be identified to broaden the therapeutic strategy for NSCLC in patients with EGFR gene mutations. Patients and Methods We evaluated 26 lung tumor samples from NSCLC patients who had received EGFR-TKI treatment from 2009 to 2011 at Nippon Medical School Hospital. Status of copy numbers and amplification of the MET gene were examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and estimated by high throughout automated image analysis. Results High copy number (>4 copies/cell) was observed in 6 patients (27%) and amplification (MET/CEP7 2.0) was seen in 0 of 26 NSCLC patients. MET gene copy number status was not correlated with EGFR gene mutation, gender, histology, or smoking history. In 2 of the 6 cases with high copy number, high copy numbers were found at both the pre- and post-treatment stages. Among the 6 patients with high copy number, 5 patients achieved partial response (PR) and one patient showed stable disease (SD) with EGFR-TKI therapy. However, the 6 patients with high copy number had statistically significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than the 20 patients with low copy numbers. (p=0.048, log-rank test). The median PFS of patients with High copy number and low copy numbers was 9.5 months and 24.4 months, respectively.

FISH was applied to evaluate high MET gene copy number and true amplification in 138 lung adenocarcinoma patients using two criteria', ' the Cappuzzo scoring system and PathVysion. MET positive cases according to the Cappuzzo scoring system evidenced both aneuploidy and true amplification, whereas PathVysion revealed only amplification. Proportion of MET FISH positive cases was 15% and 4% determined by the Cappuzzo system and PathVysion, respectively. PathVysion demonstrated higher frequencies of MET FISH positives among men and smokers and evidenced no MET FISH positives in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, which is recognized as pure lepidic growth without invasion of stroma, blood vessels, or pleura. Prognosis was significantly associated with MET FISH positive only as defined by the PathVysion system (gene amplification), not by the Cappuzzo system. However, progression-free survival time of patients with both EGFR mutations and MET FISH positive defined by the Cappuzzo scoring system was significantly shorter than with EGFR mutations alone. These results suggest that MET FISH is a potential prognostic factor and co-existence of EGFR mutation and MET FISH positive status evidences poorer prognosis compared to EGFR mutation alone, which is consistent with the results of in vitro experiments.']",

        "Background":"['Aberrant over-activation of MET receptor tyrosine kinase is involved in driving malignancies such as gastric and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and in the development of resistance to EGFR-targeting therapeutics. This has led to the development of several MET-targeting agents in the form of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), many of which are in clinical development. However, resistance to MET-targeted agents is an emerging problem. This study aims to understand mechanisms underlying resistance development to an analogue of emibetuzumab, a mAb targeting MET. Upon long term in vivo treatment, emibetuzumab-resistant tumors and cell lines were generated, isolated, and characterized to investigate their acquired resistance mechanisms. Extensive reverse phase protein array and network analysis were used to characterize the proteomic profiles of three resistant cell lines, revealing three distinct resistance profiles, one involving activation of the PI3Kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway. We further show, how these resistance mechanisms can be overcome by treatment with other targeting therapeutics both in vitro and in vivo. Two of the models demonstrated in vivo sensitivity to Sym015, a novel mixture of two mAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes of MET, partly due to ADCC, indicating that Sym015 can overcome acquired resistance to emibetuzumab. The third model demonstrated a marked increase in PI3Kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway activation. This activation translated into induced cancer cell and tumor growth, which could be inhibited by agents targeting PI3Kinase, AKT, or mTOR. This study thus points to treatment of patients with acquired resistance to single targeting MET mAbs with PI3Kinase/AKT/mTOR-targeting agents or a MET-targeting antibody mixture such as Sym015.']",

EGFR can be a partner of heterodimer of other EGFR family such as HER2 and HER3. EGFR is often overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Anti-EGFR agents including EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have considered to be effective for NSCLC when drug sensitive EGFR mutation is present. However, inherent and acquired resistances are major problems of EGFR targeting therapies. In this study, we knock-downed EGFR using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in NSCLC cell lines to examine the significance of targeting EGFR for NSCLC therapy. Materials and methods', ' We treated 14 NSCLC cell lines including nine EGFR mutant and five EGFR wild-type cell lines by geftinib or siRNAs for EGFR knock-down (siR-EGFR).

        "Background":"['Rociletinib is a novel, oral, targeted irreversible inhibitor of the cancer-causing mutant forms of EGFR currently being studied for the treatment of NSCLC. Rociletinib was designed to spare wild-type EGFR signaling. Heavily-pretreated T790M+ patients treated with rociletinib at 500 or 625mg BID demonstrated a 67% objective response rate (n = 56, Soria et al., ENA 2014). Despite these promising data, acquired resistance to rociletinib monotherapy is anticipated. To assess the in vivo mechanisms of acquired resistance to rociletinib, mice bearing PC-9 (EGFR del19) human NSCLC tumors were chronically dosed with erlotinib (50 mg/kg QD) or rociletinib (150 mg/kg BID). Rociletinib treated mice had an increased time to tumor progression as compared to erlotinib treated mice. Resistance, as defined by tumors reaching >300mm3, was observed in all (n = 10) erlotinib treated mice between days 42-61. Alternatively, resistance to rociletinib was only observed in 3/10 mice after 126 days of dosing. Emergence of the EGFR T790M resistance mutation was detected in all tumors resistant to erlotinib. Erlotinib resistant tumors (n = 7) were crossed over to rociletinib monotherapy on day 60 of the study at a mean tumor volume of 500mm3. Rociletinib treatment generated durable tumor regressions in both crossover and monotherapy treated mice, however continued dosing of rociletinib ultimately allowed for the collection of four resistant tumors. Rociletinib resistant tumors were analyzed using the SuraSeq 500 NGS panel, and all harbored copy number gains (n = 12-15) in MET and corresponding MET pathway activation as shown by RTK arrays and Western blotting. Combining rociletinib with the MET inhibitor crizotinib caused regression of the MET amplified rociletinib-resistant tumors. In separate experiments, the addition of 50 ng/ml exogenous HGF was sufficient to render several mutant EGFR cell lines immediately resistant to rociletinib, and this effect could be overcome with the combination of rociletinib and crizotinib. Finally, the combination of rociletinib and crizotinib also demonstrated potent activity in a patient derived L858R EGFR xenograft model with MET amplification (14 copies). Taken together, these data show that (1) in a PC-9 front-line model of mutant EGFR lung cancer, rociletinib has a longer time-to-resistance than erlotinib; and (2) MET/HGF pathway activation is a likely driver of acquired resistance to rociletinib in patients with mutant EGFR lung cancer, and can potentially be successfully prevented and/or treated with a combination of rociletinib plus a MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor.']",

Among the most significant treatment advancement in recent years are the introduction of target therapies of EGFR-TKIs (Erlotinib and Gefitinib) for adenocarcinoma with EGFR activating mutations, and Crizotinib for NSCLC with ALK activation (EML4-ALK fusion)1. ALK activation are associated with a subset of NSCLC patients (35%).Crizotinib is considered not a particularly potent ALK inhibitor, with IC50 at range of tens of nanomoles. It may not be an ideal agent for treating NSCLC with activating ALK. Therefore, a new ALK inhibitor with better potency and specificity could be of particularly medical importance. Currently, the industry is actively searching for such new agents. A relevant experimental model could also greatly facilitate evaluating and validating these new drug candidates.Patient derived xenografts (PDX) (including NSCLC PDX) mirror patients histopathology and genetic profiles2, thus known as patient avatar. It has improved predictive power as preclinical cancer models, and enables discovery of predictive biomarkers for targeted therapeutics. We have established a large collection of NSCLC PDX models (NSCLC-HuPrime) by engrafting nave patient tumor tissues into immune-compromised mice2.Among these models, we have identified one model, LU1656, of NSCL carcinosarcoma histology and with EML4-ALK fusion mutation. This mutation apparently causes over-expression of ALK as measured at mRNA level. This model has wild-type KRAS, c-MET and EGFR genes. Treatment of LU1656 with Crizotinib caused significant but not complete tumor response, suggesting ALK activation is one of the oncogenic drivers of this model. In addition, LU1656 also responded to Cetuximab, but respond poorly to Erlotinib. It would be interesting to examine the combination of these treatments. This model is, to our knowledge, the first reported PDX model with EML4-ALK fusion mutation. We believe that LU1656 would be a useful model to evaluate investigational ALK inhibitors, and new combination treatment regimens of Crizotinib and standard of care chemotherapies.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Therapeutics used to treat patients with NSCLC include cytotoxic agents such as taxanes, and targeted agents such as EGFR inhibitors. Although these treatments provide some clinical benefit, there is a need for improved therapies in advanced NSCLC. MGCD265 targets Met, VEGFR1/2/3, Tie-2 and Ron. Met is overexpressed and phosphorylated in NSCLC, and Met activation is identified as a molecular mechanism through which tumors evade specific inhibition of EGFR. In support of the clinical development of MGCD265, the studies described here provide a rationale for combining MGCD265 with a taxane or an EGFR inhibitor. Methods', ' The in vivo anti-tumor activity of MGCD265 (10 or 20mg/kg orally, daily) in combination with either docetaxel (5 or 10mg/kg, iv weekly), paclitaxel (30mg/kg iv, on days 0, 1, 13, 14),or an EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib (25 or 50 mg/kg orally, daily), was analyzed in multiple xenograft models including NSCLC models. The anti-angiogenic activity of MGCD265 with docetaxel was evaluated by immunohistochemistry following CD31 labeling of tumor sections from treated animals. Results', ' We demonstrate that the combination of MGCD265 with docetaxel or paclitaxel achieves greater anti-tumor responses than treating with either agent alone and this occurs in the absence of overt toxicity. The combination of MGCD265 with docetaxel also results in greater reduction of tumor vasculature. Good anti-tumor activity in the absence of overt toxicity is also demonstrated when MGCD265 is combined with erlotinib in NSCLC xenografts including a model that expresses an EGFR mutant resistant to erlotinib (T790M). PK analyses demonstrate that the combination of MGCD265 with either docetaxel, paclitaxel or erlotinib does not result in drug-drug interactions. Conclusions', ' The combination of MGCD265 with either a taxane or erlotinib results in improved antitumor activities when compared to treatments with either agent alone. In addition, these combinations are well tolerated and do not show drug-drug interactions. These preclinical studies support the clinical development of MGCD265 in combination with docetaxel or erlotinib in patients with NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) systems, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor MET and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor EGFR, are known to be expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and play an important role in the progression of NSCLC. Recent research shows that co-inhibition of MET and EGFR signaling results in more robust antitumor activity, relative to either alone, although the mechanisms of this synergism are not clear. P53, a tumor suppressor gene, is a potent regulator of apoptosis which is induced by DNA damage. The dysregulation of p53 protein is related to both oncogenesis and drug resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of synergistic antitumor effects of an EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib) and two different MET inhibitors (SU11274 and tivantinib [ARQ 197]) and to potentially define the role of P53 function as a predictive biomarker for the observed synergy. P53 wild-type (A549 and H460) cells and P53 null-type (H358 and H1299) cells without met gene amplification or EGFR mutation were used. Combined gefitinib and SU11274 or tivantinib induced profound growth inhibitory effects and apoptosis in cell lines harboring wild-type P53, but not in cells harboring null P53. SU11274 or tivantinib appeared to abrogate the P53/Mdm2 interaction, concomitantly reducing P53-ubiquitination followed by protein stabilization. Treatment with gefitinib resulted in the translocation of P53 from cytosol to nucleus. In P53 wild-type cells, the combination treatment of SU11274 or ARQ197 with gefitinib induced more robust apoptosis than single agent treatment, presumably through up-regulation of p53 target genes (FAS, Bax and PUMA). Furthermore, inhibition of P53 expression in A549 cells using siRNA significantly reduced apoptosis and downregulated mRNA and protein expression of FAS, PUMA and Bax upon combined treatment with gefitinib and SU11274. Overexpression of wild-type P53 in H1299 cells enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis by combined gefitinib and SU11274 treatment through up-regulation of FAS, PUMA and Bax and restoration of caspase activation. In an A549 xenograft model, the combination of gefitinib and SU11274 (or tivantinib) effectively shrunk tumor volume and also induced apoptosis more effectively than either treatment alone. In conclusion, P53 plays an essential role in determining synergistic efficacy of combination therapy with pharmacological EGFR and MET inhibition in NSCLC with wild type EGFR. The validation of the predictive value of P53 mutation is warranted in appropriate ongoing clinical trials of combination therapy in advanced NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR.']",

Here we explore the therapeutic potential of AZD6094, a highly potent and selective MET inhibitor, in EGFR mutant (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although many EGFRm NSCLC patients receiving first-line EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) benefit from therapy initially, the majority of patients will acquire resistance in 9-14 months1,2. Of this patient population, 10-15% of patients with emerging resistance to early generation EGFRm-TKI will have MET amplification3. Using xenograft models (HCC827) of resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib, both first-generation EGFRm-TKI, we assessed the efficacy of AZD6094 in models with varying copy number gain for MET. We demonstrate that the combination of AZD6094 with gefitinib, or AZD9291, an irreversible, selective (EGFRm/T790M) EGFR TKI, results in tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of >100% in 3 models (HCC827-ER1, PCS030 clone 1 and 2)4, suggesting that the combination is necessary and sufficient to address acquired resistance due to MET gene amplification. Moreover, we explore efficacy of AZD6094 in models representative of resistance to first-line treatment with EGFRm-TKIs, harboring MET amplification and T790M EGFR mutations. In NCI-H820 xenografts (EGFRm/T790M/MET), we demonstrate for the first time that combining MET and EGFRm/T790M TKIs (AZD6094 with AZD9291) induces tumor regressions (TGI% >100%, 94% regressions) and the loss of palpable tumors in 5/7 animals as compared to AZD9291 (TGI 48%) or AZD6094 treatment alone (TGI >100%). Pharmacodynamic analysis of tumor lysates demonstrated potent and durable inhibition of pMET in all AZD6094 treatment groups. Due to the clinical importance of understanding acquired resistance to targeted TKIs, we then generated a model of resistance to AZD6094 in MET-amplified NSCLC NCI-H1993 cells and analyzed several resistant clones (H1993R). Interestingly, MET phosphorylation remains strongly inhibited in AZD6094-treated H1993R cells, while EGFR protein expression is upregulated and leads to co-dependency between both pathways. Enhanced expression and phosphorylation of EGFR, as well as AKT, MEK and ERK activation were commonly observed in H1993R cells. Taken together, our data support the potential of AZD6094 as a novel combination therapy for MET-driven NSCLC in the context of EGFRm TKI resistance, and highlight the clinical relevance of EGFR and MET signaling in the context of emerging TKI resistance mechanisms and coordinated pathways.1.

Although the KRAS signaling pathway has been well characterized, no current therapies target this critical oncogene. Several studies have demonstrated that bypass of senescence in Kras-mediated adenocarcinoma mouse models is essential for tumorigenesis. Therefore, activation of senescence in KRAS mutant NSCLC may be an effective therapeutic strategy. We recently demonstrated that the basic helix loop helix transcription factor Twist1 cooperates with mutant Kras to induce lung adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse models and that inhibition of Twist1 in these models led to activation of Kras-induced senescence and tumor stasis. In the current study, we examine the role of TWIST1 in KRAS mutant human NSCLC. Silencing of TWIST1 in multiple KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines resulted in dramatic growth inhibition and either reactivation of oncogene-induced senescence or in some cases, apoptosis. Similar effects were also observed in four KRAS wild type lines, including cell lines with key driver mutations including a cell line with an activating EGFR mutation and a cell line with c-Met amplification. Gene set enrichment analysis of NSCLC cell lines after silencing of TWIST1 revealed a striking cell cycle arrest gene signature. Growth inhibition by silencing of TWIST1 was independent of p53 or Rb/p16 mutational status. Furthermore, activation of oncogene-induced senescence by TWIST1 silencing did not require previously defined mediators of senescence, p21 and p27, nor could this phenotype be rescued by overexpression of SKP2. To extend these observations in vivo, TWIST1 was silenced in both KRAS mutant and wildtype cell lines and these cells were implanted in NOD-SCID mice to assess tumor formation. Interestingly, silencing of TWIST1 in xenograft models preferentially inhibited KRAS mutant tumor formation suggesting that TWIST1 plays a critical in mediating KRAS tumorigenesis. Finally, inducible silencing of TWIST1 resulted in significant growth inhibition of established xenograft KRAS mutant tumors. Together these findings suggest TWIST1 is essential for the establishment and maintenance of KRAS mutant NSCLC tumors and silencing of TWIST1 in KRAS mutant NSCLC represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy.']",

Third generation irreversible TKIsAZD9291 and CO-1686were developed for efficacy in the T790M setting. However, resistance to the new class of EGFR TKIs is inevitable, prompting us to investigate the relationship between erlotinib and AZD9291 resistance mechanisms and explore novel ones. NSCLC cell lines harboring activating EGFR mutations with (NCI-H1975) or without T790M (HCC4006, HCC827, and PC-9) were exposed to erlotinib, dacomitnib, or AZD9291 at IC 75 or greater for three months to generate resistance. We observed cross-resistance to other EGFR TKIs in nearly all resistant lines, suggesting that T790M was not the main driver of resistance in the erlotinib-treated lines and that a common mechanism might account for resistance in each cell line set. An epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) was observed and a corresponding increase in vimentin staining was seen in resistant lines, consistent with cross-resistance. Previous studies showed that MET amplification caused erlotinib resistance in HCC827; our data suggest MET amplification also accounted for the AZD9291 and dacomitnib resistance in HCC827. In AZD9291-resistant HCC4006 and H1975 lines, PTEN levels were substantially reduced compared to the parental line, with a corresponding increase in PIK3 pathway markers. Whole exome sequencing data support homozygous deletion of PTEN loss as a mechanism of acquired resistance to AZD9291 in NCI-H1975. The PTEN null line NCI-H1650 was found to be resistant to all three TKIs without long-term drug exposure, implicating PTEN loss as a mechanism of de novo resistance.

Crizotinib achieved robust objective response rates of approximately 60% in ALK+ NSCLC and significantly improved progression free survival compared to chemotherapy. The emergence of secondary mutations within the ALK kinase domain or the activation of compensatory signaling pathways in crizotinib and other ALKi refractory tumors prompted searches for next generation of ALKi active against resistance mutations as single agents or in combination with other treatments. Such effort led to our recent discovery of PF-06463922, an ALK/ROS1 inhibitor with greatly improved ALK potency, brain penetration, and broad spectrum activity against all known clinical ALKi-resistant mutations. PF-06463922 is being tested in a Phase I clinical trial in both ALK+ and ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC in treatment naive or ALKi relapsed patients.In our current preclinical study, we explored rational combination strategies to further improve the efficacy of PF-06463922 in ALKi resistant cells or tumors. Our results show that compared to PF-06463922 alone, the combination of this compound with PI3K pathway inhibitors, such as PF-05212384 (PI3K/mTOR), GDC0941 (pan-PI3K) or GDC0032 (beta-sparing) leads to more robust anti-proliferative activity in vitro and greater duration of efficacy in vivo in the ALKi resistant models. These PI3K pathway inhibitors also partially overcome EGF or HGF ligand-induced resistance to PF-06463922.

        "Background":"['Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading form of cancer with limited treatment regimens and is a major cause of cancer related mortality in the United States. The endocannabinoid system composed of two cannabinoid receptors- CB1 and CB2, their endogenous ligands and the enzymes for their metabolism has been implicated in several pathophysiological conditions. They have been extensively studied in various cancers as inhibitors of tumor cell growth by modulating key cell survival pathways. Anandamide (AEA), a well characterized neurotransmitter is an endogenous cannabinoid and agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1. One way to enhance the effect of endocannabinoid signaling is to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which metabolizes AEA by using the selective FAAH inhibitor URB597. To understand the physiological role of the endocannabinoid system, the NSCLC cell lines A549 and H460 were treated with either Met-F-AEA, URB597 or in combination and subjected to further analysis. Cells which were incubated in combination with Met-F-AEA and URB597 showed reduced proliferative and chemotactic activities in vitro when compared to AEA alone, which were confirmed by reduced MMP2 secretion and stress fiber formation. Also, we have shown that the combination treatment modulates activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream targets. In response to EGFR pathway activation, cells treated with Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 underwent GO/G1 cell cycle arrest, ultimately leading to apoptosis via activation of caspase-9 and PARP. Furthermore, these results were validated in vivo in a xenograft nude mouse model system. Mouse xenografts treated with both Met-F-AEA and URB597 underwent reduction in tumor growth when compared to Met-F-AEA or URB597 alone. In summary, our results presented here show that Met-F-AEA in combination with URB597 inhibits the EGFR pathway, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our findings suggest a novel perspective for the antitumorigenic activity of the endocannabinoid Met-F-AEA when used in combination with URB597 in NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Although transforming growth factor  (TGF) is anti-cancer identified, it was also known to promote tumor malignancy by enhancing the growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), tissue invasion and metastasis in a variety of cancer cells, including non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The aim of this study was to know the contribution of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) to TGF-promoted EMT and metastasis in NSCLCs. The degree of EMT, cell scattering, migration and invasion, and protein expression of PPAR were first analyzed and compared between H460 and CH27 cells with or without TGF treatment (both are NSCLC cell lines). Chemical or shRNA blocking assay was also utilized to further confirm the importance of PPAR in promoting TGF-induced tumor metastasis. Finally, signaling pathway(s) responsible for TGF/PPAR-mediated metastasis was evaluated. The results demonstrated that TGF can effectively triggered the EMT, cell scattering, migration and invasion in H460 cell, but only a slight EMT was seen in TGF-treated CH27 cell. Meanwhile, PPAR expression was induced by TGF in H460 cells but remained unchanged in CH27 cell. This indicated that PPAR may involve in TGF-mediated metastasis. Co-treatment of TGF with GW9662 (a specific PPAR inhibitor) significantly blocked TGF-promoted metastasis of H460 cell indicating the presence of PPAR was indeed critical for TGF-attributed tumor metastasis. TGF appeared to act through P38 signaling pathway to trigger the expression of PPAR and the subsequent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) signaling pathway and the reduction of E-cadherin that eventually led to the EMT and metastasis of H460 cell. Additionally, TGF also act through P38 to trigger the expression of -catenin which could bind to and up-regulate the expression of PPAR. Blocking of -catenin activity, however, did not interfere with the metastasis indicating -catenin may not play a direct role in promoting the metastasis of H460 cell. Nevertheless, we can not preclude the possibility that -catenin may still act through PPAR to regulate the metastasis of H460 cell, indirectly. In summary, TGF-induced EMT and metastasis in H460 cell was PPAR-dependent and GW9662 revealed a therapeutical value in the control of NSCLCs (H460).']",

        "Background":"['Approximately 4% of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) carry the EML4-ALK chromosomal rearrangement. Crizotinib, a c-MET and ALK inhibitor, has shown significant therapeutic benefit as a single agent with FDA approval for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Since radiation commonly plays a key role in lung cancer treatment, we sought to evaluate the potential of crizotinib as a radiation sensitizer and the role of ALK in cellular radiation sensitivity. We examined the effect of crizotinib in combination with radiation on ALK signaling, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and radiosensitivity in ALK-positive NSCLC cell lines H3122 and H2228 in vitro. We also examined the in-vivo effects of crizotinib in combination with radiation in H3122 and H2228 xenograft models.Crizotinib blocked phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream effectors and inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of crizotinib and radiation resulted in increased inhibition of cell growth. Although cells were sensitized to radiation by crizotinib, molecular knockdown of ALK by siRNA had only modest impact on cell radiosensitivity. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that ALK-siRNA induced G1 arrest. Interestingly, low dose crizotinib induced G1 arrest, while doses above 2M induced G2 arrest. Combination treatment induced arrest in G1 and G2 phases and decreased the cell population in S-phase. Moreover, in xenograft tumor models, we observed combined treatment to produce additive tumor growth inhibition over that observed with either drug or radiation alone.We further examined the capacity of crizotinib overcome cetuximab resistance in our established in vitro resistance models. Compared with parental cells, cetuximab-resistant cells showed cross-resistance to radiation. Crizotinib inhibited the growth of cetuximab-resistant cells and resensitized cells to radiation. Compared with single-agent treatment, the combination of crizotinib and erlotinib resulted in increased growth inhibition and further re-sensitization to radiation.These data suggest that crizotinib in combination with radiation can enhance the inhibitory effect on ALK-positive tumor cell growth in vitro and in-vivo and also suggest the potential value of using crizotinib in combination with other EGFR-targeting therapeutics. Ultimately however, the potential value of crizotinib as a radiation sensitizer requires systematic clinical investigation.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Recent studies revealed that ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) 2p23 translocation, most commonly fused with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), is a novel driver oncogene in about 5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ALK 2p23 fusion (ALK+) can be diagnosed by dual color break-part ALK FISH assay to inform personalized targeted therapy using the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. However, the underlying mechanisms of ALK oncogenic signaling and more importantly ALK inhibitor crizotinib resistance are not well understood.Materials and Methods', ' To understand the mechanism of oncogenic ALK signaling, an ALK+ NSCLC microarray dataset was retrieved from NCBI-GEO data repository (GSE31210) and analyzed using data-mining bioinformatics approaches. This dataset includes the gene expression profiles of 11 ALK+ NSCLC and 20 normal lung tissue samples. Statistical analysis was carried out to identify altered genes in ALK+ NSCLC and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was deployed to uncover their network interactions. To study the resistance mechanism of the ALK+ H3122 human NSCLC cell line against the specific ALK inhibitor TAE684, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), cell viability assay and immunoblotting were performed using standard techniques.Results', ' We identified a set of 1,656 genes that were significantly altered in ALK+ NSCLC, consisting of 662 upregulated and 994 downregulated. The principal component analysis (PCA) based on the top 51 of these dysregulated genes evidently separated ALK+ and normal lung tissue samples, implicating that these genes could represent potential genomic signature of ALK+ NSCLC. The IPA analysis revealed 35 canonical pathways linked to ALK signaling, including beta-adrenergic and angiopoietin signaling pathways. The results of qRT-PCR, cell viability assay and immunoblotting showed that in translocated ALK+ H3122 human NSCLC cell line, HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) overexpression could activate ALK downstream signaling via activation of MET receptor kinase pathway, thus potentially bypassing the oncogenic ALK signaling under ALK inhibitor TAE684 treatment. Hence, alternative direct activation of ALK downstream signaling molecules via MET/HGF axis activation may potentially contribute to ALK inhibitor drug resistance.Conclusion', ' Using bioinformatics data-mining, we have identified dysregulated genes and pathways in ALK+ NSCLC, many of which are novel biomarkers not previously reported. We also verified the relevance and potential key role of MET/HGF signaling axis in ALK inhibitor resistance. Taken together, our results highlighted the cross-talk between ALK and MET signaling in NSCLC and shed new insights into possible pitfalls of potential specific ALK targeting inhibitor drugs.']",

DAB2IP is frequently methylated in lung cancer, and methylation in the m2a region is a key regulatory factor for DAB2IP expression in prostate cancer. We examined DAB2IP methylation in cell lines and in serum from erlotinib-treated NSCLC p with EGFR mutations.    Methods', '  In human lung, breast and colorectal cancer cell lines, we analyzed DAB2IP promoter methylation in regions m2a and m2b by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite genomic sequencing. In circulating serum DNA from 152 erlotinib-treated NSCLC p with EGFR mutations, we analyzed methylation in the m2a and m2b promoter regions of DAB2IP by MSP. Methylation status was correlated with clinical outcome.  Results', '  Methylation was detected in the m2a region of 42 (27.63%) p, and in the m2b region in 51 (33.55%) p. There were no major differences in clinical characteristics (age, gender, smoking history, EGFR mutation type, metastatic sites) between p with methylation in the m2a region and p with methylation in the m2b region. Overall progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (m), and median survival (MS) 28 m for all 152 p. For the 41 p with bone metastases (mets), PFS was 14 m for 30 p without methylation in the m2a region vs 8 m for 11 p with methylation in the m2a region (P=0.01), and MS was 23 m vs 10 m, respectively (P=0.19).

        "Background":"['EGFR is one of the oncogenic drivers in non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC AC). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib, show remarkable single agent activity in NSCLC AC with EGFR mutations. However, a majority of the tumors develop resistance within twelve months. T790M secondary EGFR mutation and activation of alternative signaling pathways, such as MET, are the two most common resistance mechanisms.To address this clinical challenge, we developed IMGN289, an EGFR antibody-drug conjugate consisting of the novel J2898A antibody (Ab), which selectively binds to and inhibits EGFR-driven tumor cell growth, conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1, a potent anti-microtubule agent, via the SMCC thioether linker. IMGN289 showed significantly enhanced cytotoxic activity, relative to cetuximab or unconjugated J2898A, against tumor cell line models that are dependent on EGFR signaling (Chittenden et al., AACR 2013). To evaluate the ability of IMGN289 to overcome mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance, IMGN289 activity was tested in erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant cell lines which overexpressed MET (HCC827-ER) or carry the T790M EGFR mutation (HCC827-EPR) (Suda et al., Clin Cancer Res 2010). Despite variable levels of EGFR expression in these cell lines, (193,000, 32,500 and 422,000 antigens per cell in HCC827, HCC827-ER and HCC827-EPR, respectively), IMGN289 showed comparable cytotoxic activities against these cell lines in vitro. In addition to MET overexpression, the MET pathway can also be activated by HGF, the MET ligand. While addition of HGF made the HCC827 cell line resistant to EGFR TKIs (Yano et al., Cancer Res 2008) and decreased growth inhibition by cetuximab, IMGN289 activity was unaffected. Additionally, we generated an erlotinib-resistant HCC827-ER-E4 cell line by exposing the EGFR-mutant HCC827 cells to increasing concentrations of erlotinib for 6 months, followed by subcloning. The HCC827-ER-E4 cell line expressed mesenchymal markers and acquired a mesenchymal phenotype. It expressed lower levels of EGFR, HER3 and MET compared to the parental cell line and showed no loss of PTEN. In the presence of erlotinib, HCC827-ER-E4 cells retained high levels of pAKT and pERK, suggesting that activation of alternative signaling pathways may be responsible for the erlotinib resistance. In vitro cytotoxic assays showed that IMGN289 was equally cytotoxic to the parental and the HCC827-ER-E4 cell line.In conclusion, IMGN289 demonstrated EGFR-targeted cytotoxicity against NSCLC cell lines that harbor some of the most common mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs. IMGN289 represents a promising novel candidate for treatment of EGFR-expressing NSCLC AC that has acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.']",

        "Background":"['Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is thought to have a role in the cancer progression and survival, and many carcinomas are known to overexpress IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R). Furthermore, it was clarified that IGF1R signaling contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. IGF1R is thought to be a therapeutic target for cancer chemotherapy. Previously, we screened the combination effect of afatinib and various anticancer drugs on a panel of NSCLC cell lines including gefitinib-resistant and afatinib-resistant PC-9 cells which we established. As the result, the combination of afatinib and small molecule IGF1R-TKIs (BMS754807, NVP-ADW742) has shown the most cytotoxicity on wide variety cancer cells. However, these IGF1R-TKIs have cross-reactivity to insulin receptor and, as a result, are known to cause hyperglycemia. Moreover, a phase III trial of the combination chemotherapy between erlotinib and IGF1R specific antibody, figitumumab, in advanced nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC patients (ADVIGO 1018)was closed early because of futility and an increased incidence of serious adverse events.BI836845 is a humanized IGF ligand-neutralizing antibody which is neutralizing both IGF-1 and IGF-2. The proliferation of several cell lines was reported to be potently inhibited by BI 836845 with lower than 100 g/ml EC50 values. This antibody is thought to be a substitute approach to inhibit IGF1R signaling pathway other than previous IGF1R-TKIs. We evaluated the combination effect of afatinib and BI836845 on the same NSCLC panel by MTS assay. BI836845 had only a limited cytotoxicity by itself. The combination of afatinib and BI836845 had additive or synergistic cytotoxicity on most of the NSCLC cell lines including EGFR-TKIs-resistant cells except the cells overexpressing c-Met or expressing K-ras mutation. This combination significantly inhibited both EGFR and IGF1R autophosphorylation and their downstream signaling, especially Akt/mTOR pathway, as compared with each singular usage. These combination effects were attenuated when BI836845 combined with erlotinib. Since BI836845 cross-react to rodent IGFs, we examined pharmacological activity of this combination using SCID mice xenograft mode. The mice bearing tumor were given 6 mg/kg afatinib (5 times/week, p.o.) and 200 mg/kg BI836845 (1 time/week, i.p.) for 8 weeks. This combination synergistically inhibited afatinib-resistant tumor (PC-9Afa1, PC-9Afa2) and gefitinib-resistant tumor (PC-9ZD, expressed T790M mutant EGFR). This BI836845 administration completely inhibited IGFs activity in the mice serum without alteration of blood sugar level and insulin concentration. Though growth rate of the treated mice was slightly reduced, body weight loss and other serious adverse events were not observed.From these observations, this combination chemotherapy is thought to be a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.']",

However, almost all of them acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs due to various mechanisms, such as T790M mutation or MET amplification. Afatinib is an irreversible TKI for EGFR and HER2 and known to be effective to the EGFR T790M variant. However, a half of the patient responded afatinib acquire resistance by 12 months in clinical use. Thus, to unravel the mechanisms of the resistances and to overcome them are still important issues of EGFR-TKI treatment. In this study, we established various kinds of afatinib resistant cell lines with changing drug exposing condition as we previously reported (Shien K. et al Cancer Res. 2013). We also investigated these cell lines to understand mechanisms of afatinib resistances in NSCLC.[Materials and Methods] Afatinib resistant cell lines were established using four NSCLC cell lines with activating EGFR mutations by exposing afatinib with different procedures, escalation from 1 nM, escalation from 10 nM, intermittent 2 M and continuous 2 M procedures. These cell lines were investigated about previously reported resistant related features, T790M mutation, MET amplification, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ALDH1A1 and ABCB1 expression, which were putative stem cell markers, were also investigated. Proliferative inhibitions with various drugs were evaluated using MTS assay.[Results] There were no T790M mutations in all afatinib resistant cell lines. HCC827 sublines exposed afatinib with escalation from 1 nM and intermittent 2 M, and HCC4011 sublines showed MET amplification. HCC827 sublines exposed afatinib with escalation from 10 nM and continuous 2 M, and HCC4006 sublines showed EMT features. Furthermore, ALDH1A1 and ABCB1 expression were up-regulated in HCC827 afatinib resistant sublines with EMT features. Next, we examined the effect of afatinib or crizotinib for the afatinib resistant cell line with MET amplification. We found that combination therapy with afatinib and crizotinib was effective to the MET amplified cell. The combination exposure was continued to establish a resistant subline (HCC827-ACR) to combination therapy. The HCC827-ACR was also showed EMT features and up-regulation of stem cell markers.[Conclusions] As in the cases of reversible EGFR-TKI, MET amplification, EMT, and stem cell-like features were emerged in afatinib resistant cells.

Tumoral expression of nitrotyrosines (NT), a marker of peroxynitrite activity in tissues, has been shown to suppress antitumor immune response in prostate cancer by negatively affecting tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and has emerged as a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer and melanomas, leading to the development of inhibitors of key enzymes involved in NT formation (inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS] and arginase [ARG] isoforms). The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of NT expression in a formerly published cohort of unselected surgically resected NSCLC pts. Methods', ' NT expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in TMA sections including 447 surgically resected NSCLCs with known MET gene copy number status by FISH. All cases were assessed in triplicate. IHC results were scored from 0 to 3+ according to staining intensity. Results', ' NT IHC was successfully performed in 442 pts with the following results (n/%)', ' 0 (17/3.9), 1+ (230/52.0), 2+ (173/39.1), 3+ (22/5.0). Pts were grouped as NT+ (2-3+) and NT- (0-1+). No significant association was observed between NT status and clinicopathological characteristics, including sex, smoking status, stage, histology and grade, although female patients tested more frequently negative than positive (64% vs 36%). Interestingly, MET FISH+ pts had a higher probability of having an NT+ score (p=0.044), when compared with MET FISH- subjects. Overall survival was significantly longer in NT+ vs NT- pts, with a 5-year survival of 51.0 vs 38.1 months (p=0.025, log rank test). Multivariable analysis corrected for stage and MET gene status, previously reported as significant prognostic factors in this cohort, confirmed that NT+ pts had a lower risk of death when compared with the NT- group (HR 0.72, p=0.021, Cox model). Conclusions', ' NT are frequently overexpressed in NSCLC and represent an independent favourable prognostic factor in surgically resected pts.

        "Background":"['Under normal conditions MET receptor activation, internalization, and degradation is a highly controlled process regulated by the binding of its ligand, HGF. In many cancers however, MET becomes highly dysregulated, and MET overexpression, with or without gene amplification, is associated with a poorer prognosis. Aberrant activation of MET can also occur through mutation, or increased autocrine or paracrine HGF production. MET activation leads to increased oncogenic activities including cell migration, proliferation, invasion, survival, tumor neovascularization and decreased apoptosis. Several inhibitors of MET, including type I and type II kinase inhibitors, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. LY2801653 is a type II MET kinase inhibitor being investigated in patients with advanced cancer (trial I3O-MC-JSBA, NCT01285037). In addition to MET, LY2801653 also inhibits ROS1 kinase, and the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2, with cell-based IC50 of 23nM and 7nM respectively. ROS1 is an orphan receptor that can be constitutively activated as a fusion protein either by genomic microdeletion or translocation. ROS1 fusion proteins are found in glioblastoma, NSCLC and cholangiocarcinoma. MKNK1/2 are kinases downstream of ERK and p38 and are capable of regulating translation through the direct phosphorylation of eIF4E. Increased MKNK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF4E is observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is correlated with a poor prognosis. This study evaluated the relative inhibitory effects of LY2801653, Crizotinib, XL184, XL880, and PF4217903 in a variety of cell lines against MET, ROS1, MKNK1/2, ERK, and other downstream molecules. In HCC78, a ROS1-fusion protein bearing cell line, and in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the FIG-ROS(s) fusion, LY2801653, XL184 and XL880 were more potent inhibitors of ROS1 compared with Crizotinib. Moreover, LY2801653 and Crizotinib were both efficacious in NIH3T3 FIG-ROS(s) xenografts, although LY2801653 was more potent in reducing p-ROS1 in these tumors than Crizotinib. In NCI-H2122 and Hs746T cells (mutated MET), A2780 cells (MET-negative), KP-4 cells (MET autocrine), H441 cells (HGF-independent; MET positive), HCT116 (mutated KRAS), and the cholangiocarcinoma cell lines EGI-1 and TFK-1, LY2801653 demonstrated more potent inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2 versus treatment with XL184 and XL880, while Crizotinib had no observed inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2. LY2801653 also showed inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2 in MET-amplified MKN45 cells. These findings suggests there may be clinical merits to testing LY2801653 in tumor types associated with increased MKNK1/2 activity or ROS1 fusion proteins alone, or in conjunction with aberrant MET activity, such as colorectal carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma.']",

        "Background":"['NSCLC cells acquire resistance to EGFR and c-Met TKIs after prolonged use. Our studies indicate that resistance maybe due to upregulation of alternative signaling pathways such as Wnt and mTOR. We have found that activation of Wnt/-Catenin is also associated with EMT which results in loss of cell adhesion properties and gain of motility and invasiveness. To understand the mechanism of TKI resistance in NSCLC cells with wild type EGFR, we have developed and used H2170-P (parental) cells and the TKI resistant H2170-ER (erlotinib resistant) and H2170-SR (SU11274 resistant) cells. We aim to study EMT and determine if inhibition of -Catenin, a key regulator of transcription by siRNA or inhibition of ZEB-1 a transcriptional repressor of cell adhesion proteins by inducing mir-200a will help overcome the TKI resistance in NSCLC cells.Using immunoblotting, we observed modulations in key EMT-related proteins in H2170-ER cells which showed upregulation of ZEB-1, N-cadherin, active beta-catenin, Vimentin, PRMT1 and ZO1 by 1.8, 2.4, 2, 1.8, 2.6 and 2 fold, respectively, and downregulation of E-cadherin (1.8 fold) as compared to H2170-P cells. Similar results were observed for H2170-SR cells. These results were verified using qPCR where we show that -catenin (3.4-3.2 fold) and N-cadherin (2-1.9 fold) have increased gene expression while E-cadherin (1.7-2.4 fold) has a decreased gene expression in TKI resistant H2170-ER and SR cells when compared to H2170-P cells. miR-200a induction in H2170-ER cells showed significant downregulation of ZEB-1 (3 fold) at 72 hr and an upregulation of E-cadherin (2 fold) when compared to the mock transfected cells. Morphological changes indicative of EMT were detected using immunofluorescence with Vimentin and E-Cadherin antibodies, which displayed upregulation of Vimentin filaments (2 fold) and downregulation of E-Cadherin (3 fold) in H2170-ER and H2170-SR cells when compared to H2170-P cells. We then conducted experiments where we suppressed ZEB-1 by inducing miR-200a in TKI resistant cells. The immunoblotting results suggested recovery of E-Cadherin, and downregulation of ZEB-1 and N-Cadherin in TKI resistant cells. We also observed increased sensitivity towards erlotinib and SU11274 by 20-25%. Additionally, we observed decrease in levels of -Catenin and upon siRNA knockdown of -Catenin, suppression of levels of ZEB-1. This indicates a direct correlation between nuclear accumulation of -Catenin and occurrence of EMT in TKI resistant cells by increase in expression of ZEB-1.Our results indicate that increased activation of Wnt/-Catenin pathway in the TKI resistant NSCLC cells is due to the EMT. In NSCLC patients, L858R and T790M mutations are associated with TKI resistance which could be responsible for inducing EMT. We are further studying cell lines with EGFR mutations to determine their role in induction of EMT this may provide clinicians with novel targets to overcome TKI resistance in NSCLC patients.']",

Again, the PD-L1 positive rate on IC was higher in SCC than in AD (66.0% vs 36.6%, p<0.0001). Comparing the two cell types, 70% of the total cases had consistent PD-L1 staining status (positive or negative) on TC and tumor infiltrating IC (p<0.0001). Among 117 cases detected using dual-color IF, all had CD8 positive lymphocytes in the tumor samples while 54 cases were PD-L1 TC positive. The most interesting finding was CD8 and PD-L1 double stained lymphocytes were mainly located in the tumor center in 37 out of 42 cases. Furthermore, combined analysis of the eight biomarkers studied in this cohort of NSCLC samples showed that tumor PD-L1 positive staining (on 5% tumor cells) had overlaps with the other NSCLC driver genes alterations in 28% of SCC and 69% of AD samples.Conclusion', ' This study showed almost half of NSCLC patients have PD-L1 positive expression on TC, which to some extent overlaps with EGFR/KRAS mut, ALK/ROS1 rearrangement and MET alteration. As a potential patient selection biomarker, the PD-L1 positive prevalence in NSCLC TC and/or tumor infiltrating IC provides a strong evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 immune therapy in single agent or in combination with the molecular targeted agents. Furthermore, CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor center and its PD-L1 expression status might also be considered as part of patient selection biomarker strategy.']",

For GQR, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) requires a minimum of segmentectomy, negative margins, lymph node (LN) sampling from stations 10-14 (level-1) and >2 mediastinal (level-2) stations. We reviewed details of consecutive resections for NSCLC to determine the proportion that met NCCN GQR criteria and the proportion who would have met eligibility for the RADIANT trial which requires >1 level-2 stations. Methods', \" Retrospective review of medical records of all patients who underwent curative- intent resection for NSCLC in the Memphis Metropolitan Area from 1/1/2004 to 12/31/2007. Resections for benign and metastatic disease were excluded. Death information was obtained from a national death index search. Categorical variables were compared by chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, survival curves by log-rank test. Results\", ' 746 patients were eligible (Table). Median age was 67.7 (range, 36.5 - 89.4). 61/746 (8.2%) met NCCN GQR criteria. Black patients were more likely than whites to have GQR (P=0.022). No other patient demographic factor was associated with GQR. Three year survival was 72% in those with GQR versus 63% in those without GQR (P=0.50). There was a difference in achievement of GQR between the 3 major institutions where surgery was done (P=0.001) although it was low across the board. 77.9% of patients would have been disqualified from the RADIANT trial. Conclusions', ' Majority of surgical resections for NSCLC did not achieve GQR standards per RADIANT and NCCN. The greatest deficit is in surgical sampling of level-2 LNs, but evaluation of level-1 LNs is also frequently sub-optimal.

The six resistant cell lines conserved the exon 19 deletion but the T790M resistance mutation only emerged in two (GR1, GR4), which remained sensitive to AZD9291, a third generation EGFR TKI. Six new AZD9291-resistant cell lines were derived from GR1 and GR4 by exposure to increasing concentrations of the inhibitor. Three of the AZD9291 resistant cell lines lost the exon 19 and T790M mutations, one conserved only the sensitizing mutation and two kept both mutations but with the T790M dropping to very low allelic fractions (1% and 0.03%). All resistant cell lines were characterized for AXL, MET, MER, FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression by Q-RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The effects of S49076 on the parental and resistant cell lines were analyzed by MTT, colony formation, basal membrane invasion and migration assays. Western blotting of key signal transduction proteins was used to gain insight in the drug's mechanism of action.Results\", ' AXL overexpression was the most common event related to gefitinib/erlotinib resistance in the panel of cell lines, with T790M mutation, FGFR1 or BCL-2 overexpression and MET activation being less frequent events. Regarding AZD9291 resistance, AXL upregulation was again widespread, with loss of EGFR mutations as the second most frequent event. In proliferation assays, S49076 showed strong antitumor activity against all PC9-derived cell lines with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib or AZD9291) and not carrying the T790M mutation, with IC50 of 0.2-1.2 M and less than 10% surviving cells at 1 M of drug in most cases. In contrast, S49076 was less active against the parental PC9 cells and the T790M positive resistant lines, with more than 50% of surviving cells at 50 M of drug. S49076 also inhibited the anchorage-independent growth and migration of the resistant cell lines. A correlation was found between mRNA and protein levels of AXL and sensitivity to S49076.

The combination of onartuzumab + erlotinib is currently being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial for 2nd/3rd line NSCLC (1). EGFR-activating mutations, including deletions of exon 19 and L858R point mutations, are associated with better response to erlotinib. However, EGFR mutant NSCLC tumors with high HGF expression are less responsive to EGFR small molecule inhibitors (2) (3). Since onartuzumab blocks HGF-induced Met activation, the addition of onartuzumab to erlotinib may be more beneficial than erlotinib alone in such patients. To test this hypothesis preclinically, we engineered the human NSCLC cell line PC9 (exon 19 deletion of EGFR and Met positive) to express hHGF endogenously, and evaluated combination effects of onartuzumab + erlotinib in vitro and in vivo. Methods', ' PC-9 cells were transfected with hHGF expression plasmids, and a stable clone was selected. For in vitro analyses, parental PC-9 cells and PC-9/hHGF cells were treated with various concentrations of erlotinib combined with 30g/mL of onartuzumab, and cytotoxicity was examined. Additionally, the phosphorylation status of Met, EGFR, ERK and AKT was examined by western blot analysis of whole cell lysates. For in vivo analyses, PC-9/hHGF cells were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice. After tumors reached approximately 200 mm3 in volume, onartuzumab (30 mg/kg, IP, Q3W) was administered alone or in combination with erlotinib (50 mg/kg, PO, daily) and tumor volume was measured over time. Results', ' One stable clone with high expression of hHGF was selected by hHGF ELISA and western blotting. This PC-9/hHGF clone was less sensitive to erlotinib compared to the parental PC-9 in vitro. Adding onartuzumab to erlotinib suppressed proliferation of these PC9/hHGF cells. pERK and pAKT levels were significantly reduced when PC-9/hHGF cells were treated with onartuzumab + erlotinib. In PC-9/hHGF xenograft tumors, onartuzumab or erlotinib alone had modest effects on tumor growth. However, combining onartuzumab and erlotinib dramatically suppressed tumor growth. Conclusions', ' Overexpression of hHGF decreases response of PC9 cells to erlotinib. Onartuzumab + erlotinib was more efficacious than erlotinib alone on PC9/hHGF cells in vitro and in vivo.

We recently implemented an innovative multiplexed PCR-based assay (SNaPshot) to genotype cancer pts more comprehensively. SNaPshot is performed in a CLIA-certified lab with tumor DNA from paraffin-embedded samples; it tests for common mutations in 13 key oncogenes such as EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and TP53. We examined SNaPshot results in EGFR mutant cancers with acquired TKI-resistance. Methods', ' We reviewed all NSCLC samples sent for prospective SNaPshot analysis from 03/09 to determine the range of tumor genotypes. A simultaneous chart review identified EGFR mutant pts undergoing repeat biopsy after the development of TKI-resistance in which a corresponding pre-treatment tumor sample was available for SNaPshot analysis and MET FISH testing. Results', ' A total of 271 patients with NSCLC underwent SNaPshot testing between 03/09 and 11/09; 164 (61%) were found to have at least one mutation.

Platinum-based combination regimen or molecular target drugs, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are used for first line chemotherapy of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Somatic mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been identified in NSCLC and those mutations confer sensitivity to the EGFR-TKIs such as gefitinib. Unfortunately, it is already known that the almost cases are developed to drug resistance after chemotherapy. Several EGFR-TKI resistant mechanisms have been reported, including T790M gefitinib/erlotinib resistance mutation, C797S osimertinib resistant mutation, c-MET amplification and ErbB3 activation. In the previous study, we revealed that the miRNA biosynthesis pathway was critical for maintain the cisplatin resistant phenotype. Further, it was reported that EGFR modulated miRNA maturation through the phosphorylation of AGO2. Protein phosphorylation is one of most important post transcriptional modification mechanisms and miRNA is also associated with fine tuning of mRNA expression. Thus, we focused on the relationship between miRNA expression and kinase signaling in gefitinib resistance.Generally, developed resistant cell lines and cell culture techniques were used in resistance research. However, some resistance mechanisms observed in cultured cells are not reflected the in vivo. Recently, some three-dimensional (3D) cell culture techniques are developed and expected to bridge the gap between normal cell culture and in vivo models. In this study, we attempted to analyze the resistant mechanism of gefitinib resistant cell lines in suspended spheroid culture using RPMI1640 medium containing suspension polymer, FP001. We screened differences of relative resistance to anticancer compounds in 3D culture and normal culture condition using chemical library and ATP assay. As results; we revealed that ErbB3 and Akt phosphorylation levels were significantly decreased in spheroid formed from resistant cell lines in 3D culture condition compared to these levels with normal culture condition. On the other hand, miR-205 levels remain high in all resistant cell lines. Furthermore, some anticancer agents, including kinase inhibitors showed higher sensitivity in resistant cell lines under 3D condition than that under normal cell culture. We speculate that the decreased resistance depends on normal culture in plastic dish and remaining resistant mechanism in 3D culture is important and similar to in vivo. In conclusion, this approach with 3D culture is more close to in vivo, such as xenograft model, and promising contribute to drug resistance research.']",

Ultradeep sequencing can detect low frequency and expanded clonal mutations in primary tumors to better inform treatment decisions. KRAS coding exons in 61 treatment-nave colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors and KRAS, EGFR, ALK, and MET in lung tumors from three Chinese non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were sequenced using ultradeep sequencing methods. Forty-one percent of CRC patients (25/61) harbored mutations in the KRAS active domain, eight of which (13%) were not detected by Sanger sequencing. Three (of eight) had frequencies less than 10% and one patient harbored more than one mutation. Low frequency KRAS active (G12R) and EGFR kinase domain mutations (G719A) were identified in one NSCLC patient. A second NSCLC patient showed an EML4-ALK fusion with ALK, EGFR, and MET mutations. A third NSCLC patient harbored multiple low frequency mutations in KRAS, EGFR, and MET as well as ALK gene copy number increases. Within the same patient, multiple low frequency mutations occurred within a gene. A complex pattern of intrinsic low frequency driver mutations in well-known tumor oncogenes may exist prior to treatment, resulting in resistance to targeted therapies. Current targeted cancer therapies usually lack durability and demonstrate limited overall efficacy in patients. The types of low frequency concurrent mutations in candidate oncogenes presented here suggest necessary modifications both to methods for detection of these variants and to general treatment strategies. To date, Sanger sequencing has been effectively used for detection of treatment-relevant somatic mutations. However, in a heterogeneous mixture of cancerous and normal tissue, Sanger sequencing will likely fail to detect low frequency mutations. More sensitive and cost-effective sequencing methods are required to systematically assess the mutation status within cancer pathway genes or at the whole genome level. Furthermore, because patients often develop resistance to targeted therapy over time that is due to the preexistence of low frequency mutations in oncogenes, treatment strategies based on combination therapy might prove to be the most optimal treatment approach for cancer patients. Ultradeep sequencing can characterize intratumor heterogeneity and identify such mutations to ultimately affect treatment decisions.']",

        "Background":"['ERBB3 is widely expressed in human carcinomas, and its over expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with various carcinomas, (i.e., breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and head and neck cancers). The presence of ERBB3 correlates with local to distal metastasis in lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers as well as bone invasion in prostate cancer. Activation of ERBB3 is also implicated in the development of resistance to current cancer treatments. Due to its lack of kinase activity, the activation of the ERBB3 receptor is dependent on heterodimerization with active receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The recruitment of ERBB3 into active, heterodimer complexes is mediated by its ligand Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) or by amplified, over expressed RTKs in a ligand independent manner. Therefore, ERBB3 can crosstalk with most major receptors involved in cancer development and maintenance such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and c-MET. AV-203 is a potent, humanized anti-ERBB3 antibody that inhibits both ligand-dependent and independent activation of ERBB3 both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AV-203 were characterized in mice using the A549 non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model. AV-203 administered IV in mice exhibits acceptable pharmacokinetics supporting preclinical efficacy studies. AV-203 administered IV in A549 NSCLC xenograft tumor bearing mice had lower serum AUC than nave mice, demonstrating that the presence of human ErbB3 may alter the PK parameters of AV-203. In evaluating pharmacodynamics in vivo, AV-203 was able to down regulate total ERBB3 and ERBB3 signaling in A549 tumors in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of ERBB3 signaling correlated with significant dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in the A549 xenograft model. Dose scheduling studies with the constant AV-203 dose of 2.5 mg/kg revealed that the most efficacious schedule is the more frequent dosing at Q3D. In comparing the total dose of 10 mg/kg per 14 day cycle, at varying dose per injection and frequency, AV-203 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition at all dose schedules. These data conclude that the efficacy of AV-203 is driven by total drug exposure and that AV-203 is not dependent on Cmax for its antitumor activity.']",

Gr.4 neutropenia occurred in 1 of 6 EM pts at 360 mg bid and 3 of 7 PM pts at 240 mg bid, which identified each dosage as RP2D for EM and PM respectively. Cmax and AUC0-12 increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 300 mg bid in the EM cohorts and up to 240 mg bid in the PM. At 240 mg bid, the ARQ 197 Cmax and AUC0-12 of PM pts were 1.5-fold and 1.9-fold higher than those of EM pts respectively. Pts who had a relatively high exposure of ARQ 197 such as Cmax > 4,000 ng/mL or AUC0-12 > 40,000 ng.h/mL on day 1 tended to experience Gr.4 neutropenia regardless of CYP2C19 genotype. Two NSCLC pts, both of whom were PM at 240 mg bid, achieved partial response and 16 pts (34.0%) had stable disease (SD) for >= 16 weeks, especially 6 of 25 pts (24.0 %) in NSCLC had SD for >= 28 weeks. Conclusions', ' ARQ 197 was well tolerated in PM pts as well as EM pts. CYP2C19 genotype clearly affected the exposure to ARQ 197 which led different RP2Ds, 360 mg bid for EM pts and 240 mg bid for PM pts. ARQ 197 monotherapy showed a clear sign of activity.

Methods', ' Patients with biopsy proven clinical stages I/II NSCLC were administered erlotinib 150 mg/day for 21 days in this single-arm open-label phase II trial. The study population was not enriched using clinical or molecular criteria. CT imaging was obtained at baseline and within 1 week after completion of erlotinib treatment.

Methods', ' We employed circulating tumor DNA analysis using Cancer Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq) to study putative mechanisms of innate and acquired resistance to rociletinib. CAPP-Seq was applied to a total of 115 serial plasma samples from T790M-positive NSCLC pts (n = 43) enrolled in the TIGER-X (n = 42) (NCT01526928) and TIGER-2 (n = 1) (NCT02147990) clinical trials. Results', ' Rociletinib resistance was diverse, with mutations and/or copy number gains affecting 9 genes involved in bypass pathway activation and tumor suppressor pathways. Multiple resistance mechanisms were observed in 23% of pts. Examples of emergent alterations included activating KRAS mutations in three pts, a novel tertiary mutation in EGFR (L798I) in one patient, and an EGFRC797S mutation in one patient. Increased MET copy number was the most frequently observed mechanism of resistance, occurring in 26% of cases. Pts with heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms at baseline (both T790M and increased MET copy number) displayed inferior responses and significantly shorter progression free survival (P< 0.05). In agreement with these clinical findings, erlotinib-resistant xenografts treated with rociletinib reproducibly developed MET amplification. Importantly, sensitivity to rociletinib could be reinstated by combined therapy with the METinhibitor crizotinib. Conclusions', ' We observed diverse and heterogeneous resistance mechanisms to rociletinib. The association of inferior outcomes with multiple resistance mechanisms at baseline emphasizes the clinical importance of tumor heterogeneity in these pts.

Methods', '  HCC827 cells were treated with EGFR-TKI (0-9 days) with apoptosis pathway-specific QPCR array and TLVM analysis performed.  MTS and crystal violet assays were performed. Western blot analysis was performed to examine prosurvival signaling developed against erlotinib, alone or in combination with MET inhibitor SU11274.

Expression analysis studies demonstrated common tumor-associated expression of CARD8 but relatively low BCL-2 level in NSCLC. In vitro cell line studies suggest that CARD8 induction was preceded by a resurgence of STAT3 activation. In vivo xenograft model (HCC827/erlotinib; H1975/erlotinib+ SU11274) also verified upregulated CARD8/BCL-2 activation within early resistant cells.

Acquired EGFR C797S mutation has been identified as one major mechanism; however, resistance mechanisms of remaining cases are still largely unknown. Methods', ' Using next generation sequencing (NGS) targeting 416 cancer-relevant genes, we analyzed the mutation profiles of 99 NSCLC patients that were clinically resistant to osimertinib. Results', ' In addition to the notable EGFR C797 variants (22%), L792 mutations were identified in 10% of patients, and a further 7% cases carry L718 mutations. Further analysis of 14 patients with paired pre-treatment samples confirmed that these EGFR mutations were acquired during treatment. Interestingly, all L792 mutations are in cis with T790M and in trans with C797 mutations (when present in the same patient). 2 out of 10 L792-positive patients and 6 out of 7 L718-positive patients did not have co-existing C797 mutations, suggesting C797-, L792- and L718-mutated cells may represent different resistant clones. In vitro experiments demonstrated that L792 and L718 mutants also increase osimertinib IC50, and therefore confer their resistance. Besides secondary EGFR mutations, alterations in other key genes such as MET, KRAS, ERBB2 and PIK3CA may also contribute to osimertinib resistance. Notably, MET and KRAS amplifications are present only in patients without above EGFR secondary mutations. Conclusions', ' In this study, we identified secondary mutations on C797, L792 or L718 residues of EGFR in 29% of osimertinib-resistant patients. Combined with in vitro study, our data strongly suggest that L792 and L718 mutations are likely to alternatively cause osimertinib resistance.

To date, no integrated comprehensive genomic investigation of EGFR TKI resistance has been reported.Methods', ' FFPE biopsies of erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant tumors were obtained from 16 EGFR mutant NSCLC patients.

Differential expression analysis between resistant and pre-treatment states revealed enrichment in the post-resistant tumors of ERBB2, and FGFR signaling pathways. Biopsies from patients that developed an EGFR T790M mutation post resistance exhibited enrichment in pathways associated with cell cycle, meiosis, telomere maintenance and transcriptional regulation. Copy number analysis demonstrated amplifications in the post-resistance setting that correlated significantly with progression free survival, including regions containing NFKBIA, NKX2-1, and TSC-1. There was also strong correlation between the copy number changes observed and the expression mRNA levels of specific genes. Of note, each resistant tumor exhibited greater copy number similarity to the corresponding matched pre-treatment sample compared to other tumors within the resistance cohort.Conclusions', ' We conducted the first ever comprehensive integrated genomic analysis of EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC patients, and identified both known and potentially novel drivers of EGFR TKI resistance.

        "Background":"['Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) benefit from treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, almost all of the patients eventually develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs within approximately one year. The resistance mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs have not been fully elucidated. We previously established an erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cell line named PC-9/ER3 after continuously exposing PC-9 cells, which harbor an in-frame deletion in EGFR exon 19, to erlotinib. PC-9/ER3 cells were 136-fold more resistant to erlotinib than the parental cells. Although the PC-9/ER3 cells did not carry the T790M mutation or MET amplification and had similar levels of pSTAT3, pJAK2 increased in the resistant cells (Cancer Sci 103, 1795-802; 2012). Meanwhile, pacritinib is a novel macrocyclic pyrimidine-based JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor with clinical activity in patients with myelofibrosis and lymphoma, which will be used as a standard therapy for myelofibrosis. In this study, we evaluated the synergistic effect of pacritinib combined with erlotinib on JAK2-medatited EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC.Drug sensitivity was determined using an MTT assay and the combination index was calculated according to the methods based on the median-effect analysis. The combination of pacritinib with erlotinib showed synergistic effects on JAK2-medated EGFR TKI-resistant PC-9/ER3 cells in some cases. Western blotting showed that the combination treatment markedly suppressed pAKT and pERK although pSTAT3 was equivalent regardless of treatment with the pacritinib, erlotinib, pacritinib plus erlotinib, or control in PC-9/ER3 cells. Receptor tyrosine kinase array profiling demonstrated that pacritinib suppressed MET in the PC-9/ER3 cells. The combined treatment of pacritinib and erlotinib in PC-9/ER3 xenografts showed more tumor shrinkage compared with each drug as monotherapy. Western blotting revealed that pMET in the tumor samples was inhibited. These results suggest MET suppression by pacritinib may play a role in overcoming the EGFR-TKI resistance mediated by JAK2 in the PC-9/ER3 cells.In conclusion, pacritinib combined with EGFR-TKI might be a potent strategy against JAK2-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance.']",

Methods', ' All patients who received postoperative ACT in the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between 2001 and 2013 with complete records in the database of the hospital and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study for analysis. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) in terms of age. Survival analysis was performed using KaplanMeier estimates, log-rank tests and Coxs proportional hazards regression analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used, and survival analysis of the match data was carried out. Results', ' Of 1,129 patients with stage IB to stage III NSCLC who underwent radical resection, 929 who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Of them, 166 (17.7%) patients were older than 65 years, and the remaining 763 (82.3%) patients were younger than 65 years as the control group. There was no significant difference in DFS between the two age groups before propensity score was matched (665 days [95%CI 579.46, 759.51] vs. 697 days [95%CI 581.55, 812.45], P = 0.807). Furthermore, no significant impact of age on DFS was observed between the PS-matched groups (653 days [95%CI 550.91, 755.09] vs. 706 days [95%CI 585.68, 826.32], P = 0.778).

Conclusions', ' The results suggest that DFS was similar regardless of age of NSCLC patients. Besides, postoperative radiotherapy could probably decrease the survival benefit from postoperative ACT in older patients. ACT should not be withheld from elderly patients.

Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) could be an attractive target in these tumors. We used a cancer vaccine composed of human recombinant EGF conjugated to a carrier protein P64K. The vaccine is intended to induce antibodies against patients own EGF that would block EGF-EGFR interaction.Objectives', ' In NSCLC cell lines we assessed whether anti-EGF antibodies can inhibit the pathway activated by EGF-EGFR binding and whether sera from immunized patients can block downstream key signal transduction proteins. NSCLC cell lines were selected to determine whethergenetic alterations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, BRAF or MET can have an impact on inhibition of EGFR pathway by anti-EGF antibodies.Experimental Procedures', ' Western blotting was used to evaluate the capacity of antibodies and sera from patients to inhibit EGFR activation pathway. MTT assays were performed to evaluate the effects on tumor cell proliferation.Results', ' The anti-EGF antibodies showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on EGF-induced activation of EGFR and downstream pathway molecules such as Akt and ERK 1/2. This inhibition was observed in all cell lines tested, including KRAS, EGFR and BRAF mutated cells as well as cells with ALK translocations or MET amplification. Sera from 10 patients immunized with the P64K-EGF vaccine were then tested. All sera reversed EGF-induced activation of EGFR and ERK 1/2, but some sera were significantly more potent than others. By contrast, two control sera from non-vaccinated patients failed to inhibit EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK 1/2. Finally, anti-EGF antibodies were also able to block the stimulatory effects of EGF on the growth of some NSCLC cell lines.Conclusions', ' Anti EGF antibodies and sera from patients immunized with an EGF vaccine, called otherwise EGF Pathway Targeted Immunization inhibits EGFR signaling in NSCLC cell line models.

However, many non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases with EGFR mutation that had responded to EGFR-TKIs finally acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs. It has been reported that T790M mutation and MET amplification caused resistance to EGFR-TKIs . Recent study suggested that overexpression of HGF was also related to resistance to EGFR-TKIs. However, the whole mechanism of acquired resistance to TKIs is still not fully known. Methods', ' We established 5 clones of elrotinib resistant PC-9 cell line (harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion) (designated as PC-9ER1-5) by exposing PC-9 to low-dose erlotinib. The protein expression of EGFR-related molecules was examined by Western blotting. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) or real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was performed to examine copy numbers of EGFR-related genes. Results', ' In MTS assay, the IC50 value for the parental PC-9 cells was 0.02 mol/L. By contrast, those for PC-9ER1-5 were more than 33mol/L. All 5 resistant cell lines retained exon19 deletions and did not obtain T790M mutation. The qPCR assay and aCGH showed no MET amplification in PC-9 or PC-9ER1-5. HGF protein was not overexpressed in PC-9ER1-5 by ELISA. The protein expressions of several molecules in the EGFR-Akt signaling pathway were examined by western blotting after erlotinib treatment. Although phospho-EGFR was suppressed in both PC-9 and PC-9ER1-5 with 2-mol/L erlotinib, phospho-Akt was not suppressed in PC-9ER1-5. PTEN expression was not down-regulated in PC-9ER1-5. The combination of erlotinib and PHA-665752, MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, did not suppress phospho-Akt or cell proliferation in PC-9ER1-5.

Methods', '  NSCLC drug development was investigated using trial disclosures from publically available resources. Compounds were excluded from the analysis if they began phase I clinical testing before 1998 and if they did not use treatment relevant endpoints. Analysis was conducted in regards to treatment indication, compound classification and mechanism of action. Costs of clinical drug development for advanced NSCLC were calculated using industry data and assumptions, a 9% yearly discount rate and assuming a clinical trial length of 2.5 years for phase I trials, 4 years for phase II trials, 5 years for phase III trials and an average of 5 phase I trials, 7 phase II trials, and 4 phase III trials per approved drug.

The likelihood, or cumulative clinical trial success rate, that a new drug would pass all phases of clinical testing and be approved was found to be 11%, which is less than the expected industry aggregate rates (16.5%). The success of phase III trials was found to be the biggest obstacle for drug approval with a success rate of only 28%. Biomarker-guided targeted therapies (with a success rate of 62%) and receptor targeted therapies (with a success rate of 31%) were found to have the highest likelihood of success in clinical trials.

Potential savings may be even higher if fewer clinical trials are required for successful development.   Conclusions', '  Physicians that enroll patients in NSCLC trials should prioritize their participation in clinical trial programs that involve either a biomarker or receptor targeted therapy, which appear to carry the best chances for a successful treatment response.

We here investigated the pattern of relapse and potential factors affecting disease progression with PS deterioration during the first-line EGFR-TKI therapy.  Methods', '  Consecutive 48 pts with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC who had had PS of 0-2 and then recurred after the initiation of EGFR-TKI therapy in the first-line setting between 2003 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed.

There were 6 males and 23 females, performance status was 0 and 1 in 17 and 12 patients, and EGFR gene variations were Ex18, Ex19, and Ex21 in 1, 14, and 14 patients. 1 patient wasn't met starting criteria; therefore, 28 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up time was 30.2 months (range 765). 16 patients (57.1%) had partial response for Cb/Pem therapy and all of the patients were switched to Gef. The reasons for switching Gef were completion of Cb/Pem in 21 patients, toxicity in 5 patients, and the doctors judgment in 2 patients. There were no febrile neutropenia or treatment-related deaths. The overall response rate was 85.2%. The 2-year survival rate was 62.9%, PFS was 16.0 months and OS was not met. According to the EGFR gene variants, the PFS was 17.0 and 15.0 months for patients with Ex19 and Ex21. The OS was not met for patients with Ex19 and was 26.0 months for patients with Ex21. Conclusions\", ' Cb and Pem followed by Gef maintenance therapy might be an initial treatment option for advanced EGFR-positive NSCLC patients.

        "Background":"['Radiotherapy is a critical component in the definitive treatment of locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), and while concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation is the standard approach, improvements have been minimal. Molecularly-targeted therapy to further enhance radiation effects beyond platinum-sensitization is needed to further improve radiotherapy efficacy. A systematic approach needs to be developed that can rapidly identify novel drugs that can be combined to enhance radiation effects. However, current approaches using traditional clonogenic survival assay (tCSA) and colorimetric assays are inadequate for high throughput drug screens to identify novel radiation sensitizers. To enable screens adapted for radiation drug screening, we have developed a method which we coin the High Throughput Clonogenic Survival Assay (HCSA) that allows rapid screening of drug libraries to identify potent radiation sensitizers. As a proof-of-principle, we used the Kras mutated lung cancer cell line H460, and validated the hits using traditional assays. Drugs at various concentrations or vehicle were added to cells seeded overnight in 96 well plates at low densities, and after 6 hours, plates were irradiated at various doses. After incubation, colonies were stained and imaged on the INCell 6000 (GE Health), and colony count determined using the INCell Developer image analysis software. Drug screens were done using a Custom Clinical Collection of 150 compounds. We compared the HCSA method to tCSA and found that HCSA recapitulates a similar cell survival curve and survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) values for several cancer cell types. Drug screens identified several compounds that were cytotoxic to the KRAS mutant H460 cells alone at 1 M (inhibitors to Src/Abl, IGF1R, ROCK1, AKT, PI3K, c-MET) and at low nM concentrations (HSP90 and HDAC inhibitors). Multiple drugs of the same class were found to be radiation sensitizers and levels of potency seemed to reflect the clinical relevance of these drugs. For instance, several late generation PARP inhibitors were found to be good sensitizers in the HCSA, but the ones that have not made it into clinical development, or in the case of BSI-201, was proven to not even be a PARP inhibitor, do not come out in the screen. We also discovered that several inhibitors of pathways downstream of activated mutant KRAS (PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and MEK1/2) sensitized H460 cells to radiation, which is biologically relevant for this Kras mutant cell line. We believe these results demonstrate the promise of HCSA as a high throughput drug screening platform to identify novel radiation sensitizers. This will greatly expedite the discovery of novel targets and drugs for clinical translation to enhance the effects of radiotherapy in lung cancer.']",

Recently, a germline deletion polymorphism of BIM was reported to predict tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) outcome in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. In this study, we examined the predictive role of BIM deletion in a Korean NSCLC cohort. Also, we explored genetic alteration profile of patients exhibiting primary resistance to EGFR TKI treatment despite EGFR mutation. Methods. Data from 197 consecutive patients who had stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with TKI-sensitive EGFR mutation were collected from the NSCLC database of Seoul National University Hospital between 2006 and 2011. BIM deletion polymorphism was genotyped with polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) and visualized with 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Additionally, we also examined putative clinical predictors of EGFR TKI outcome, including line of treatment, EGFR genotype, and smoking status. For patients who exhibited primary resistance to EGFR TKI treatment, we performed additional molecular analysis including fluorescence in situ hybridization for MET amplification and ALK fusion, and targeted deep sequencing of 46 cancer-related genes to explore the mechanism of primary resistance. Results. In this cohort, the median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients receiving EGFR TKIs was 11.9 months, and the objective response rate was 78.8%. Patients with wild-type BIM (n = 172; 89.1%) and BIM deletion (n = 21; 10.9%) exhibited no difference in median PFS after EGFR TKI treatment (11.3 months for wild-type BIM, 11.9 months for BIM deletion; P = 0.791). Also, the line of treatment, the genotype of the EGFR-activating mutation, and smoking were not predictive of PFS for EGFR TKIs. However, patients with recurrent disease after curative surgical resection had a longer PFS than patients with initial stage IV disease (16.0 months for recurrent disease, 10.0 months for stage IV disease at initial presentation; P = 0.007). From the examination of pretreatment tissue of 11 patients exhibiting primary resistance, de novo EGFR T790M mutation was identified in one patient. We also found a patient with de novo MET amplification and another patient with ALK fusion. Targeted deep sequencing identified no recurrent, coexistent drivers of NSCLC. Conclusion. BIM deletion polymorphism showed poor predictive role in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patient cohort, although their initial report indicated remarkable predictive power. In a small portion of cases with primary resistance, we identified coexistent genetic alterations of cancer-related genes that could explain primary resistance.

        "Background":"['Detection and chemoprevention of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been unsuccessful in part due to our limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been suggested that normal airway epithelia share molecular abnormalities with tumors and may serve as progenitors for lung malignancies. We sought to analyze molecular profiles of lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), two major subtypes of NSCLC, and matched normal airways to elucidate aberrant expression patterns in early phases of lung tumorigenesis. All specimens were obtained from primary early stage NSCLC consented patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy (n=20). We profiled RNA isolated from tumors and normal lung as well as from brushings of multiple matched airways that were histologically confirmed to lack neoplastic or preneoplastic cells (n=194). Expression signatures signifying genes significantly and concurrently differentially expressed between both tumors and airways compared to normal lung tissue (tumor-airway-normal/TAN signatures) were then derived independently for SCC and smoker adenocarcinoma cases and were comprised of 1,803 and 1,938 genes, respectively. The TAN signatures effectively clustered tumor and airways from normal lung samples (p<0.001). Further analysis showed that a subset of the genes separated SCC- and adenocarcinoma-adjacent airways. Moreover, pathways and gene-network analysis using Ingenuity pathways software highlighted similarities and differences in pathway modulation between airway epithelial fields of SCCs and adenocarcinomas. Embryonic stem cell and eicosanoid signaling pathways were most significantly modulated among those common to both TAN signatures (p<0.001). Retinoic acid receptor and stem cell signaling pathways mediated by NANOG and lineage oncogene SOX2 were most significantly modulated in the SCC TAN signature, whereas NF-kB and PTEN signaling pathways were most prevalent in the adenocarcinoma TAN airway signature (all p<0.001). Gene networks mediated by lineage oncogene NKX2-1/TITF-1 down-regulation and TP63 up-regulation, and networks mediated by increased expression of the MET and ERBB2 oncogenes were predominantly functionally modulated in the SCC and adenocarcinoma TAN signatures, respectively. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed up-regulation of MET in adenocarcinomas and normal airways compared to normal lung. These findings highlight expression patterns and pathways that are deregulated differentially in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinomas and SCCs and thus offer detection markers as well as therapeutic targets to guide personalized chemoprevention in early stage NSCLC patients.

B16F10 tumor cells (2  105) were implanted via i.v. tail vein injection into mice on day 0. SIM-89/ placebo administration was initiated 3 days after implantation for 10 days followed by assessment of lung tumor burden. Lung nodule diameters were morphometrically measured on digitally captured images. The results for each treatment group (n = 10 animals) were averaged, and statistical t test analysis was done comparing each treatment group to the placebo treated control.  Results', '     SIM-89 is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that targets members of the HGF receptor tyrosine kinase families,with additional inhibitory activity toward AMPK (A1/B1/G1) and TRKA. SIM-89 significantly decreases HGF level in culture medium of nsclc cell lines at the IC50 of 625nmol/l. In vivo, these effects produce significant dose-dependent inhibition of tumor burden in an experimental model of lung metastasis.  Once daily oral gavage administration of SIM-89 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in tumor burden,  as determined by a reduction in lung wet weights. Conclusions', '    These data indicate that SIM-89 may prevent tumor growth through a direct effect on tumor cell proliferation and by inhibition of invasion mediated by HGF receptors.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) leads to the development and progression of human epithelial cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) are effective therapy for NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. However, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs is unavoidable and occurs through various molecular mechanisms including the development of T790M secondary EGFR mutations, MET amplification, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and other mechanisms. One of potential strategy to overcome EGFR-TKIs is through inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). PLK1 is one of the key regulators of mitotic progression and a DNA damage recovery checkpoint. PLK1 inhibitors are at various stages of clinical development. Our previous studies showed that mesenchymal NSCLC cell lines are more sensitive to PLK1 inhibitor than epithelial ones. This study examines the efficacy of PLK1 inhibition in NSCLC cell lines with acquired resistance to the EGFR-TKI erlotinib.Methods', ' Erlotinib resistant cell lines were developed in EGFR mutant, erlotinib sensitive cell lines PC9, HCC4006 and HCC827 by chronic exposure to stepwise increased concentrations of erlotinib. The effects of the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib alone or combined with erlotinib on proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, EGFR-dependent signaling, DNA damage and DNA damage response signaling were evaluated using CellTiter-Glo assay, TUNEL assay, BrDU incorporation assay, comet assay, western blot and immunofluorescence. Sensitivity of volasertib alone or in combination with erlotinib was also detected in the human tumor xenograft model. The combination index (CI) was calculated by Calcusyn software.Results', ' Acquired erlotinib resistant NSCLC cell lines with endogenous EGFR mutations (PC9, HCC4006 and HCC827) showed diverse resistance mechanisms', ' T790M EGFR mutation, MET amplification and EMT. Four of the 6 ER clones that underwent EMT became more sensitive to volasertib. Volasertib and erlotinib demonstrated synergistic effects only in cells bearing T790M EGFR mutations where we observed more pronounced G2M arrest and increased apoptosis. Volasertib alone or in combination showed enhanced DNA damage, activation of CHK1/ATR and CHK2/ATM pathways and an increase in H2AX foci but only a modest effect on canonical signaling downstream of EGFR. The combination treatment exhibited a pronounced reduction in the size of tumor compared to single agent treatment in subcutaneous xenograft model generated with T790M mutant EGFR TKI-resistant PC9 cell line.Conclusions', ' These data demonstrate that PLK1 inhibition alone induces apoptosis and DNA damage in EGFR-TKI resistant cell lines with EMT.

Approaching with a comprehensive docking method with our established chemical-protein interactome (CPI) and crizotinib, we have discovered 301 PDB-deposited proteins corresponding to 353 ligand binding pockets among a total of 1,780 PDB-deposited human protein entries. Systemic pharmacology approach also applied including validation the molecular target(s) of TKIs in vitro. Especially multiple human cellular models (including NSCLC and melanoma) and signaling study, luc-reporter, autophagy/apoptosis, proteomics study and NGS analysis applied. Interestingly, crizotinib besides had a high CPI binding score (ZZ_score) of -2.2778 against tyrosine kinase Lck, also had -1.4672, -1.1242, -0.7033 and -1.5384 against MAPK3, S6K, GSK-3 and HDAC 7A, respectively, which indicated crizotinib had potential broad range interaction with both TK and ser/thr kinases.

Furthermore, crizotinib increased p21Waf1/cip1 and Foxo3A expression and tumor suppressor miR-146a in human melanoma cells. Taken together, crizotinib induces miR-146a, autophagy and p21waf1/cip1 may potentially treat other type of human cancer by concurrently targeting tyrosine kinase, Akt/mTOR/Foxo axis and nuclear receptor, shedding a light for future both anti-cancer and anti-metabolic disorder drug discovery and development.

Despite its prominence, the biology of BM remains poorly understood.  Several theories of BM development exist, including the linear progression model, which suggests that the metastatic capabilities of tumor cells develop at primary sites following the accumulation of alterations. The parallel progression model argues that tumor cells disseminate early and accumulate changes independently at the secondary site.  We compare the tumor profiles of BM from common cancers to understand the biology and to identify differential treatment strategies.  Methods', ' Tumor samples were profiled using a multiplatform service (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ), including sequencing (Sanger, NGS), protein expression (IHC) and amplification (ISH).  Results', '  5,391 NSCLC (293 BM, 5,098 lung), 3,595 breast cancer (99 BM, 3496 breast) and 761 melanoma (101 BM, 660 skin) unpaired samples were included. No significant differences were found in 48 genes between BM and the primary tumor sites, with the exception of PIK3CA in breast cancer, which was mutated less in BM vs. the breast samples (10% vs. 26%, p=0.02). In contrast,  expression of TOP2A, TOPO1 and TS, and amplification of EGFR, were more prevalent in BM as compared to the primary sites (Table).  Conclusions', '  A similar genetic landscape with limited differences was seen in BM of NSCLC, melanoma and breast cancer compared to primary tumors.  The limited differences are more consistent with a linear progression model of cancer metastasis. Additionally ,this suggests that both primary tumor and BM would respond to similar chemotherapeutics with the consideration of effective blood-brain barrier-penetrant drugs. Small molecule inhibitors of EGFR could be considered due to increased EGFR amplification and the higher TOP2A, TOPO1 expression prompts consideration of topoisomerase inhibitors like etoposide or irinotecan.

Despite promising initial response acquired resistance develops mediated by the emergence of the secondary T790M mutation or by focal amplification of MET. An epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is clinically linked to NSCLCs with acquired EGFR TKI resistance. The exact mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance with EMT phenotype remain elusive; therefore, we attempted to develop a strategy to prevent the emergence of EGFR TKI resistance with EMT phenotype. In order to mimic the development of acquired EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC patients, TKI-sensitive HCC4006 cells harboring mutated-EGFR were exposed to increasing concentrations of gefitinib to generate resistant cells with mesenchymal phenotype. After 6 months, the cells became resistant to gefitinib (HCC4006GeR) with no MET copy number increase and with no apparent gain of secondary T790M mutation. Subsequent genomics and proteomics analyses of HCC4006GeR confirmed enrichment of genes distinctive to mesenchymal cells. Multiplex Luminex growth factor assays identified increased secretion of TGF1 from HCC4006Ge-R cells. We discovered that the depletion of EGFR by shRNA or inactivation of mutated EGFR activity by EGFR TKI promoted TGF1 secretion and subsequent induction of EMT, which modulate signaling and apoptosis pathways contributing to the development of the resistance. Consequently, we hypothesized that concurrent inhibition of EGFR and TGF receptor in HCC4006 cells should prevent the emergence of gefitinib resistance with mesenchymal phenotype. After culturing HCC4006 cells in EGFR (gefitinib) and TGF receptor (SB431542) inhibitors, we successfully prevented EMT, although those cells were still resistant to gefitinib (HCC4006GeSB-R). Interestingly, the cells remain sensitive to irreversible EGFR TKI AZD9291 and CO-1686, suggesting the presence of T790M mutation. DNA sequencing of EGFR expressed in HCC4006GeSB-R detected secondary T790M mutation. Droplet digital PCR analysis detected that the frequencies of EGFR allele coding for T790M in HCC4006Ge-R and HCC4006GeSB-R cells are 1.2% and 18.3%, respectively, which were increased from 0.015% in HCC4006 cells harboring heterozygous Del L747-E749+A750P/T790M mutation. The frequency of T790M allele in HCC4006 was higher than the frequency in PC9 cells (0.001%) which reproducibly develop EGFR T790M as a mechanism of EGFR TKI resistance. Taken together, we discovered that suppression of gefitinib-induced EMT in EGFR mutant HCC4006 NSCLC cells preferentially selects for the previously unreported and rare subpopulation of HCC4006 harboring T790M.

Despite initial tumor response, targeted therapy invariably fails due to acquired resistance. Classical studies of acquired drug resistance focusing on late clinical events in rebiopsy studies have identified some resistance mechanisms including T790M-EGFR, MET amplification and AXL upregulation.Methods. HCC827 and PC-9 NSCLC cells (sensitizing EGFR exon 19-del) were used in vitro and in vivo drug-sensitive models. MTS viability assay, TLVM cell mobility assay, immunoblot and immunofluorescence and in vivo xenograft IHC analysis were performed. Transcriptome analysis of HCC827 cells under erlotinib inhibition time-course was performed using Affymetrix microarray gene expression profiling (Human GeneChip 1.0 ST arrays) in triplicate at 0 hr, 8 hr, 9 days of erlotinib-treatment, and 9 days pretreatment with erlotinib followed by 7 days drug-washout. Data analysis was performed using PCA, heatmap, BAMarray and PathwayStudio 6.0 analysis. We also performed mass-spectrometry-based global profiling analysis of cellular metabolome in 5 replicate.Results. We analyzed drug-sensitive HCC827 and PC-9 cells under erlotinib inhibition to characterize the adaptive response that engenders drug resistance. We identified an early adaptive drug-escape that emerged after 9 days of erlotinib, characterized with MET-independent mitochondrial BCL-2/BCL-xL prosurvival priming to result in 100-fold IC50 increase towards resistance. These cells displayed a quiescence state associated with retarded cell proliferation/cytoskeletal functions. Transcriptome profiling analysis of the early adaptive resistant HCC827 cells revealed a remarkable genome-wide adaptive reprogramming of gene expression signature, involving pathways of cell adhesion, cell cycle regulation, cell division/mitosis, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, response to DNA damage stimulus, and DNA repair. Metabolomic profiling revealed a global adaptive metabolic reprogramming also, with resultant suppression of glucose and TCA cycle metabolism, and lipid bioenergetics. Our studies also identified autocrine TGF2 signaling pathway in mediating the early adaptive resistance in the mutated-EGFR lung cancer cells that escaped erlotinib inhibition through a combination of quiescence-state and EMT, cellular metabolic reprogramming and STAT3/BCL-2/BCL-xL mitochondrial prosurvival priming.Conclusion. Early adaptive drug-escape emerges within a subpopulation of EGFR-mutant NSCLC under erlotinib inhibition. This constitutes an early-stage minimal residual disease leading to eventual resistant tumor relapse. These early drug-escaping tumor cells undergo global cellular reprogramming with upregulated mitochondrial prosurvival priming, representing attractive therapeutic targets to eradicate drug resistance.']",

Testing rates for EGFR were 67% in 2013, 80% 2014 and 69% 2015 (similar pattern with other mut). In never/passive smokers EGFR testing rate was 84% (47% pos for mut); 70% former smokers tested (13% pos); current 64% tested (5% pos) (p < 0.001 testing by smoking). KRAS testing performed in 32% with 31% pos, but did not triage genotyping (97% KRAS pos pts were tested for EGFR).

EGFR T790M is the most common of these mutations and is found in > 50% of refractory tumors. We assessed the in vitro and in vivo activity of CPD 24, a newly developed, covalent, small-molecule inhibitor of both first-line and T790M mutant EGFR, but not WT EGFR.

Dose- and time-dependent pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated by treating mice bearing matrigel plugs containing H1975 cells. Drug levels were measured in plasma samples by LC-MS. CPD 24 was administered to athymic nude mice bearing H1975, HCC827, or A431 xenografts (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, QD, PO) and tumor growth was measured twice per week with digital calipers. CPD 24 was also formulated in PLGA microspheres and administered subcutaneously (SC) as a sustained release formulation to mice bearing H1975 or A431 xenografts (30 and 100 mg/kg, Q3D, SC). Proliferation of H1975 and HCC827 cells in the presence of CPD 24, growth factors, and a MET inhibitor was measured with an IncuCyte live-cell imaging system.Results', ' The IC50 of CPD 24 for p-EGFR inhibition was 4 nM on L858R/T790M mutant EGFR (H1975 cells), 17 nM on the exon 19 deletion EGFR (HCC827 cells), and 510 nM on WT EGFR (A431 cells). CPD 24 inhibited the growth of tumor cells in vitro and led to both dose- and time-dependent p-EGFR inhibition in vivo. Phosphorylation of EGFR in H1975 cells growing in matrigel plugs was inhibited by > 75% for 12 hours by a single 30 mg/kg dose. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was observed in two EGFR mutant NSCLC xenograft models (H1975, 89% TGI; HCC827, 139% TGI) but not in a WT EGFR model (A431). CPD 24 formulated in PLGA microspheres achieved drug levels above the IC50 for 72 hours after a single SC dose. Tumor regression was observed with this formulation in H1975 xenografts but not in WT tumors. HGF was able to confer resistance to CPD 24 inhibition in both H1975 and HCC827 cells in vitro. This resistance was prevented by the addition of a selective MET inhibitor.Conclusion', ' CPD 24 is a covalent inhibitor of both first-line and T790M mutant EGFR while maintaining > 100-fold selectivity over WT EGFR.

Approaching with a comprehensive docking method with our established chemical-protein interactome (CPI) and crizotinib, we have discovered 301 PDB-deposited proteins corresponding to 353 ligand binding pockets among a total of 1,780 PDB-deposited human protein entries. Systemic pharmacology approach also applied including validation the molecular target(s) of TKIs in vitro. Especially multiple human cellular models (including NSCLC and melanoma) and signaling study, luc-reporter, autophagy, apoptosis assay, FACS and NGS analysis applied. Interestingly, crizotinib besides had a high CPI binding score (ZZ_score) of -2.2778 against tyrosine kinase Lck, also had -1.4672, -1.1242, -0.7033 and -1.5384 against MAPK3, S6K, GSK-3 and HDAC 7A, respectively, which indicated crizotinib had potential broad range interaction with both TK and ser/thr kinases. In addition, those crizotinib achieved high ZZ scores against PPAR- (-1.6145) and VitD3R (0.9479), suggesting a high binding affinity of crizotinib with these nuclear proteins. Our preliminary studies have showed that the crizotinib induced autophagy by activated LC3 in vitro and inhibited oncogenic Akt/mTOR signaling in human multiple melanoma cells resulting in G2/M cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, crizotinib increased p21Waf1/cip1 and Foxo3A expression and tumor suppressor miR-146a in human melanoma cells. Taken together, crizotinib induces miR-146a, autophagy and p21 waf1/cip1 may potentially treat other type of human cancer by concurrently targeting tyrosine kinase, Akt/mTOR/Foxo axis and nuclear receptor, shedding a light for future both anti-cancer and anti-metabolic disorder drug discovery and development. This is the first CPI-based systemic study on leading discovery of crizotinib off-target phenotypic importance.

The emergence of resistance to crizotinib is reportedly conferred by genetic alterations, such as ALK kinase domain mutation, ALK copy number gain or activation of the bypass pathways. CH5424802 (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) is a new, highly selective ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor that partially overcome acquired resistance to crizotinib, thereby inhibiting crizotinib resistant mutations of ALK in a preclinical experiment (Cancer Cell 19, 2011', ' 679-90) A phase II study of CH5424802 demonstrated 93.5% response rate (JLCS 2012); however, we also encountered acquired resistance phenomenon.To elucidate the acquired resistant mechanisms, we established CH5424802-resistant H2228 cells harboring EML4-ALK fusion gene under the step-wise continuous exposures of CH5424802. Six sublines that could grow in the presence of 1 mol/L of CH5424802 (designated H2228CHR clones -1, -2, -3, -5, -6, and -9) were obtained. All sublines revealed more than 30-fold resistance to CH5424802 (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50]', ' 1.0-4.8 mol/L) compared with the parental H2228 cells (IC50', ' 0.03 mol/L). In addition, the sublines similarly indicated resistance to Crizotinib. H2228CHR clones showed the constitutive phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 even in the presence of CH5424802, whereas phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 was markedly decreased in the parental H2228 cells. Surprisingly, ALK fusion gene disappeared in all H2228 CHR clones, which were confirmed immunostaining, reverse transcription PCR, FISH and Western blotting. H2228 CHR clones -1 and -2 presented higher phosphorylated levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) than the parental H2228 cells and showed sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib.Furthermore, we also established CH5424802-resistant ABC-11CHR cells derived from ABC-11 cells from pleural effusion of an ALK inhibitor nave patient. In ABC-11CHR cells, phosphorylated ALK was markedly decreased and phosphorylated MET was increased.In conclusion, signal switching from ALK to other tyrosine kinase receptors induced resistance to a highly selective ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor CH5424802 in NSCLC cell lines harboring ALK fusion gene.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the second most common malignancy in the United States with the highest cancer-mortality rate. Molecular targeted therapy in oncogene addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has gain landmark proof-of-principle success in clinical utility in recent years. Prime examples are EGFR targeted therapy against mutated EGFR tumors using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib/gefitinib, and also ALK targeted therapy against EML4-ALK tumors using ALK inhibitor crizotinib. Superior response rates and progression free survival outcomes were observed with the use of targeted therapeutics even in first line setting. Nonetheless, targeted therapeutics against mutant-EGFR and EML4-ALK tumors invariably develop an acquired tumor resistance to the TKIs. Mutational resistant mechanism has been well-established. Alternative signal pathway activation such as MET/HGF in both EGFR and ALK TKI resistance, or HER family signaling activation in EML4-ALK resistance have also been reported. We have recently begun studies focusing on the non-mutational mechanisms of tumor resistance under early time window of TKI treatment. Using HCC827 and PC9 cells as mutant EGFR addiction model, as well as H3122 and H2228 NSCLC cells as EML4-ALK addicted model, we have uncovered a novel early adaptive TKI resistance that can be evident as early as 7-14 days under initial TKI treatment. The early adaptive tumor cells displayed remarkable tumor resistance against the TKIs with 100-fold higher IC50. In mutant-EGFR against erlotinib, there was an upregulated mitochondrial antiapoptotic/prosurvival BCL-2/BCL-xL signaling dependence that is MET-independent. The early resistant cells were adaptive, highly reversible and adopted a quiescent state during TKI-induced resistance. On the other hand, our studies of early TKI resistance in EML4-ALK fusion cells revealed that while the adaptive resistance to TAE684 was also reversible, it appears to be not dependent on BCL-2/BCL-xL upregulation. We found that in both targeted TKI early resistance, the tumor survivor cells exhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers changes with decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression. Our studies also provided in vitro and in vivo evidence that these early adaptive TKI resistant tumor cells can be targetable for prevention or eradication of tumor resistance emergence, such as utilizing BCL-2/BCL-xL pathway inhibitors, such as ABT-737, in combination with EGFR TKI in mutant-EGFR addicted NSCLC. Further preclinical model studies will focus on investigating the molecular and genomic changes and gene network regulation in the early adaptive resistant tumor cells, to enable a new paradigm of novel therapeutic targets discovery to overcome early tumor resistance emergence and improve long term outcome of targeted therapy in lung cancer.']",

We performed ultra-deep NGS on extracted cfDNA using a customized Illumina library preparation, hybrid capture panel covering 37 lung cancer related genes (complete exons and partial introns), and ultra-deep sequencing (HiSeq4000). Mean sequencing depth was 50,000X (150 million, 150bp reads per sample). After specialized consensus-based error correction for low allele frequency (AF) genomic alterations, the median unique DNA molecules per position were 3,500. The mean sequence error rate was reduced by 20-fold to 0.002%, enabling the confident call of a driver mutation as low as 0.03%. In a subset of cases, paired plasma droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed for common EGFR and KRAS mutations using a validated assay.Blinded to tumor genotype, plasma NGS detected SNVs (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF), indels (EGFR, ERBB2), and fusions (ALK, ROS1) as well as significant copy number gains (CNG) (ERBB2, MET). Sensitivity of cfDNA for the detection of known oncogenic drivers was 88% (45/51). A single false positive driver mutation was identified in a case with a known EGFR mutation in tumor; plasma NGS found both EGFR exon 19 del (0.88% AF) and KRAS G12D (2.65% AF), and plasma ddPCR confirmed the presence of both mutations (2.2% and 2.0% AF).

Up to 1 g of DNA (minimum, 0.2 g) was used for library preparation using liquid-phase cRNA capture probes targeting all exons of BRAF, CTNNB1, CHIC2, CSF1R, DNMT3A, EGFR, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KIT, KRAS, MAPK1, MAP2K2, MET, NPM1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, PTPN11, RET, RUNX1, TP53, and WT1 (302 kb). Libraries were sequenced by Illumina technology to obtain 101bp or 150bp paired-end reads. Mean coverage was 1596; 50x depth was achieved at >95% of positions. The analysis pipeline was validated for variant allele frequency >10%. Variants were called and interpreted using the Clinical Genomicist Workstation. A list of clinically actionable variants (hot spots) was curated by literature review. Of 210 cases, 94 (45%) were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 20 (9.5%) were pancreatic cancer (PCA), and 17 (8.1%) were colorectal cancer (CRC), the balance representing 38 diverse other malignancies. FFPE tissue cores yielded a median of 2.4 g DNA (interquartile range 1.0-4.9 g). Sequencing identified a mean of 5.4 non-synonymous coding and/or splice site variants per case (single-nucleotide variants and indels). Of these, a mean of 2.8/case were not known polymorphisms and likely represented somatic mutations. Somatic variants most commonly occurred in TP53 (233 variants in 107 cases), KRAS (52 variants in 51 cases), and EGFR (40 variants in 33 cases). Sequencing identified 74 clinically actionable (i.e., predictive or prognostic) mutations in 61/210 = 29% of cases. In NSCLC, actionable mutations were present in KRAS codon 12 (29/94 cases), EGFR exons 19 (5 cases), 20 (1 case) and 21 (5 cases), and the PIK3CA helical domain (4 cases).

Specialty-specific educational programs (delivered by a multidisciplinary team) were developed and administered at provincial and national specialty meetings. Participants were assessed on their knowledge of targeted therapy, molecular testing and sample requirements  Results', '  Ten educational programs were administered across the country targeting pathologists, thoracic surgeons, respirologists, interventional radiologists, medical and radiation oncologists. 210 pre- and 188 post-intervention surveys were completed.Baseline results demonstrated significant uncertainty', ' 30% were unsure regarding tissue handling techniques to ensure successful molecular testing, 20% chose an incorrect technique. Half were unfamiliar with how to initiate EGFR and ALKtesting, and 17% were uncertain of whom to test. After the intervention, specialist knowledge increased regardingtissue handling techniques (OR=3.01, p<0.0001), appropriate fixation (OR=2.48,p<0.0001), and the level of uncertainty decreased from 30% to 3% (p<0.0001). Participants understood the importance of initiating testing as soon as possible rather than deferring to the medical oncologist (p<0.0001), and to send samples even if unsure they met technicalrequirements (OR=4.63,p<0.0001).

        "Background":"[\"TTF-1/NKX2-1, a homeobox-containing transcription factor indispensable for lung morphogenesis, was previously identified by four independent groups including us, as a lineage-survival oncogene involved in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma. We have further shown that TTF-1/NKX2-1 induces expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1), which in turn plays a sustainer role for EGFR-mediated signaling. Interestingly, ROR1 knockdown effectively overcame EGFR-TKI resistance-conferring, HGF-mediated bypass signaling through MET, suggesting that ROR1 sustains not only EGFR but also additional RTK signaling. However, the underlying mechanism remained rather elusive.We report here an unanticipated function of this receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) as a scaffold of cavin-1 and caveolin-1 (CAV1), two essential structural components of caveolae. Caveolae are 50-100 nm invaginations of the plasma membrane that play various physiological roles, including function as a platform for insulin-induced signaling in adipose tissue. We found that ROR1 facilitates the interactions of cavin-1 and CAV1 at the plasma membrane in a kinase-independent manner, thereby preventing the lysosomal degradation of CAV1, as well as consequential caveolae formation. Caveolae structures and prosurvival signaling towards AKT through multiple RTKs such as MET and IGF-IR are consequently sustained. The present findings thus provide mechanistic insight into how ROR1 inhibition can overcome EGFR-TKI resistance due to bypass signaling via diverse RTKs, which is currently a major clinical obstacle.Inhibition of prosurvival signaling and proliferation of lung cancer cells could be recapitulated by knocking down cavin-1 or CAV1, but they are unlikely to be suitable molecular targets for NSCLC treatment due to their crucial physiological functions in various organs even at low expression levels. In this regard, it should be noted that ROR1 is considered to be an onco-embryonic antigen with tumor-specific expression in adults. Taken together, development of novel therapeutic means to inhibit the scaffold function of ROR1 and thereby attack the cancer's Achilles heel is thus anticipated to be an attractive approach for improved treatment of this devastating cancer.\"]",

        "Background":"['Background', ' EGFR inhibitors are effective clinical therapies for EGFR mutant NSCLC, but efficacy is limited by the development of acquired drug resistance. The mechanisms of resistance include secondary mutations in EGFR (T790M) and activation of compensatory signaling pathways (MET, IGFR and AXL). Mutant selective EGFR inhibitors (WZ4002, CO-1686 and AZD9291) are effective in preclinical and clinical models of EGFR T790M. Our lab has demonstrated that reactivation of ERK signaling is a mechanism of resistance to WZ4002 (WZ) which could be reversed or prevented by using a combination of WZ and MEK inhibitors. Given the broad array of possible EGFR inhibitor resistance mechanisms, we evaluated whether WZ combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib (TRA) can prevent the emergence of resistance in vitro and in vivo.Methods and Results', ' We developed a plate based resistance assay in which 350 cells/well are plated in 96 well plates and treated weekly. This system allows for evaluation of drug efficacy over weeks of treatment and can be used to measure both time to development and frequency of drug resistance. Given that ERK reactivation can cause resistance to WZ, we evaluated WZ, TRA or the combination thereof (WZ/TRA) using PC9 cells. Single agents led to 100% resistance in 2-3 weeks, versus 5% with WZ/TRA in 24 weeks. We then tested WZ/TRA in 5 additional EGFR TKI sensitive cell lines, including several known to develop acquired resistance to gefitinib (HCC827, MET amplification; HCC4006, EMT or FGFR activation; HCC2279; FGFR activation; H3255, T790M; HCC2935). In all cases, WZ/TRA significantly reduced the emergence of drug resistant clones compared to each single agent. In models with established drug resistance mechanisms, WZ/TRA was effective in 3/3 models with T790M mutations, but not (0/5) in models with established non-T790M resistance mechanisms. In models where WZ/TRA was effective, the combination led to increased apoptosis compared to single agents and effective inhibition of ERK signaling. We also evaluated the effectiveness of the WZ/TRA combination in vivo using EGFR L858R/T790M genetically engineered mouse model and PC9GR4 (T790M+) xenografts. Combination WZ/TRA treatment prevented tumor outgrowth for 24 weeks in 5 EGFR L858R/T790M GEMM mice whereas individual treatments did not. Additionally, we found that WZ/TRA combination treatment, but not single agents, could cure 7/15 xenograft tumors as assessed by lack of tumor regrowth after treatment cessation.Conclusion', ' Our studies suggest that the combination of a mutant selective EGFR inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor can prevent the emergence of both T790M and non-T790M mediated drug resistance mechanisms. This strategy is more effective at preventing (6/6) than treating (3/8) cancers with established drug resistance mechanisms and should be evaluated in clinical trials in EGFR TKI nave EGFR mutant NSCLC patients.']",

Methods', '  An anti-human PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (SP263) was optimized for use with Ventana OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit on the automated BenchMark ULTRA platform. The PD-L1 IHC assay was validated for use in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of NSCLC and SCCHN in a series of studies addressing sensitivity, specificity, robustness, and precision. MEDI4736 is a human IgG1 mAb that blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1 and CD80 with high affinity and selectivity. A subset of clinical trial samples from a Phase 1/2 study of MEDI4736 (NCT01693562) was analyzed to determine optimal cut-off for enriching response to MEDI4736. Inter-reader precision was established by 3 pathologists who evaluated 81 NSCLC and 100 SCCHN samples across the range of expression levels. Results', '  The Ventana PD-L1 IHC (SP263) assay met all pre-defined acceptance criteria. The scoring algorithm was defined using statistical analysis of clinical response data and PD-L1 staining parameters observed in a set of NCT01693562 clinical trial samples. Samples of both cancer types are considered test positive when the membrane of   25% of tumor cells stain for PD-L1 at any intensity. Inter-reader precision in determining PD-L1 status resulted in an overall percentage agreement of 97% and 92% for NSCLC and SCCHN, respectively.

Whether ORR is related to improvement or delay in NSCLC symptoms as reflected by patient reported outcomes (PRO) is unknown. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory responder analysis to evaluate the relationship of ORR and time to deterioration of patient-reported chest pain, dyspnea, and cough (TTD).  Methods', '  A retrospective analysis of crizotinib study 1007, a second-line, open-label, ALK positive NSCLC study, was conducted to evaluate the effect of ORR on TTD. Patients (n = 374) were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel) or crizotinib and the primary endpoint of improved PFS was met. PRO measures were collected (QLQ-C30 and LC13) and exploratory analysis suggested improved TTD in the crizotinib arm, see Shaw et al. (NEJM 2013). We conducted a responder analysis (CR or PR versus SD or PD) to assess TTD by response (yes vs no), irrespective of treatment.  Results', '  In the exploratory analysis population, 313 were considered PRO-evaluable. The exploratory retrospective Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated improvement in TTD for responders.

Analysis of the three symptoms individually also demonstrated improvement for responders.  Conclusions', '  This exploratory retrospective responder analysis supports that radiographic response may be associated with a delayed TTD in three NSCLC-related symptoms, irrespective of whether a TT or CT is administered. Limitations of this analysis include an open-label design leading to potential bias and the need for further validation of a lung cancer symptom score and definition of symptom progression.

Prior studies identified the EGFR T790M mutation and activation of MET, PI3K, AXL, HER2 and the MAPK pathway as drivers of acquired EGFR TKI resistance. To date, comprehensive molecular profiling to identify actionable modifiers of EGFR TKI response has not been conducted in NSCLC p on therapy.    Methods', '  We performed next generation sequencing (NGS) using a 263-gene Nimblegen custom cancer panel on DNA isolated from primary patient lung adenocarcinoma FFPE specimens prior to initiating standard erlotinib treatment and upon the development of acquired erlotinib resistance after only 3 months of therapy.   Results', '  In the pretreatment sample, we confirmed the presence of the EGFRL858R mutation in 95% of the sequencing reads and discovered a concurrent BRAF V600E mutation with a frequency of ~ 6%. NGS performed on the acquired erlotinib resistance sample revealed acquisition of the EGFR T790M mutation with a frequency of ~ 14%. Notably, the frequency of the BRAF V600E mutation increased 10-fold upon acquired erlotinib resistance from ~ 6% in the pretreatment tumor to ~ 60% in the recurrent tumor.  We found that overexpression of BRAF V600E in H3255 human NSCLC, which harbor EGFR L858R (but not BRAF V600E) and are erlotinib sensitive, caused resistance to erlotinib treatment (10-fold increase in erlotinib IC50).  BRAF V600E-mediated erlotinib resistance was reversed by treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Additional functional studies are ongoing and the complete dataset will be presented.  Conclusions', '  These results indicate that EGFR-mutant NSCLC can harbor additional oncogenic driver mutations in BRAF at low frequencies prior to therapy.  EGFR TKI treatment can lead to expansion of BRAF V600E expressing tumor cells, resulting in acquired EGFR TKI resistance that can be reversed by BRAF inhibitor treatment.

Methods', ' Study objectives include evaluation for safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and clinical activity of MGCD516 in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. Eligible pts received a single dose for PK profiling followed by continuous daily dosing (QD) in 21 day cycles. Results', ' 32 unselected pts (14 men/18 women; median age 62 years; range 27-85) with advanced solid tumors were treated in escalating dose cohorts of 10, 20, 40, 80, 110, 150 or 200mg MGCD516. At 80mg, 1 of 6 evaluable pts experienced a DLT (Grade 3 palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia). At 200mg, 3 DLTs were observed among 3 evaluable pts (intolerable Grade 2 neuropathy, fatigue and stomatitis in 1 pt each), demonstrating 200mg exceeded the MTD. Treatment-related AEs ( > 15% of pts; Grade1-3) included hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and decreased appetite. One treatment-related Grade 4 AE (febrile neutropenia) was reported. Prolonged stable disease (SD) has been observed in multiple pts including 3 pts with at least 17 weeks SD and 1 pt with 35 weeks SD. Preliminary PK data show that exposure increased dose proportionally with doses up to 200mg. At 150mg, the Cavg and AUC0-24 values at steady state (90.7 ng/mL and 2.18 gh/mL, resp.) exceed plasma exposure projections required for inhibition of key RTK targets and antitumor efficacy in nonclinical tumor models. Preliminary clinical PD data indicate dose dependent inhibition of the VEGF and MET pathways. Conclusions', ' The Phase 1b dose for MGCD516 was established at 150mg QD. MGCD516 shows favorable PK characteristics, on-target PD effects and is associated primarily with constitutional or GI-related AEs. Phase 1b enrollment began November 2015.

Methods', '  We analyzed prospective data from 126 EGFR mutants with advanced NSCLC who had 1 bx after AR developed on EGFR TKI therapy.  All biopsies underwent multiplexed CLIA-certified SNaPshot genotyping. Some pts consented to provide tissue for patient-derived cell-line (PDCL) establishment. 42 pts had >1 post-AR bx.  We collected data on EGFR TKI therapy, mechanisms of AR observed over multiple biopsies, bx safety and correlations between clinical and PDCL data.  Results', '  Among 42 pts with multiple post-AR biopsies, median age= 57 (range 39-88), 73% were female, 62% had EGFR exon 19 deletion and 31% had L858R. The median number of post-AR biopsies was 2 (range 2-5). While the original EGFR mutation was uniformly maintained, we observed variation in AR mechanisms among 20/42 pts, with changes in T790M status over time in 10 pts. Notably, both gain and loss of T790M were observed on serial biopsies, without a clear correlation to the timing of EGFR TKI therapy or bx site. Changes in histology (8), development of EMT (1) and EGFR amp (1) were also seen.  22/42 pts had no variations in detected mechanisms of AR on serial biopsies, including T790M (n=11), MET amp (2), EGFR amp (1), both MET and EGFR amp (1), SCLC transformation (1), BRAF mutation (1), and no AR mechanism identified (5).

        "Background":"['A subset of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) carries chromosomal rearrangements involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene. More frequently ALK is juxtaposed to the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene on chromosome 2 and generates a constitutively active EML4-ALK fusion protein that triggers downstream oncogenic signals leading to increased cell proliferation and survival. The majority of ALK-rearranged NSCLC presents a peculiar histology characterized by a solid signet-ring cell and a mucinous cribriform pattern that is frequently associated with a metastatic phenotype. As the signet ring phenotype and metastasis are associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular reprogramming often activated in cancer cells during invasion and metastasis, we investigated whether ALK induces EMT in NSCLC. We performed RNA sequencing analysis on human ALK-rearranged NSCLC cell lines treated with ALK inhibitors or where EML4-ALK was knocked-down by shRNA. We found that EML-ALK regulated several genes related to EMT. In particular, the epithelial splicing regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (ESRP1 and ESRP2), key regulators of a splicing switch during EMT, were repressed in ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells and their repression was dependent on ALK activity. In keeping with these observations, H2228 and DFCI032 cells displayed a mesenchymal phenotype with almost complete suppression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and a strong expression of the mesenchymal markers, vimentin and N-cadherin. In H2228 and DFCI032 cells, both E-cadherin suppression and vimentin up-regulation were dependent upon EML-ALK kinase activity because treatment with ALK inhibitors (TAE684 and crizotinib) or ALK knock-down reverted the phenotype of H2228 and DFCI032 from mesenchymal to epithelial and decreased their invasive potential. We excluded the involvement in EMT of ALK-rearranged NSCLC of other RTKs, such as EGFR or MET, because their inhibition did not have any effect on E-cadherin and vimentin expression. In ALK-rearranged NSCLC, the regulation of E-cadherin suppression was mainly transcriptional whereas vimentin regulation was post-transcriptional for both cell lines. Overexpression of ESRP1 led to up-regulation of E-cadherin, whereas ESRP1 knock-down impaired the reversion to an epithelial phenotype associated to inhibition of ALK activity. In conclusion, we showed that oncogenic ALK regulates EMT in NSCLC through ESRP repression. These findings could have implications for the biology of ALK-rearranged NSCLC in terms of metastatic potential and resistance to therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Activating mutations in the Ras oncogenes characterize 20-40% of all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, which establishes Ras genes as the most commonly mutated oncogenes in this malignancy. Mutations in the KRAS oncogene characterize more than 20% of all NSCLC malignancies and recent studies suggest that those tumors can be divided into KRAS dependent (KRAS-Dep) and KRAS independent (KRAS-Ind), according to their dependency on KRAS mutant for cell survival and proliferation. Although, the KRAS signaling pathway has been considerably studied using high throughput transcriptomic or proteomic technologies in isolation, the specific network of effector genes and proteins that drives carcinogenesis in NSCLC is still far from being understood.Integrative profiling with different omics technologies harbors the potential for characterizing the specific network of effector proteins associated with specific oncogenes. We developed a bioinformatics approach to reconstruct active and targetable networks associated with KRAS dependency in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). By integrating matched global transcriptomics, proteomics and phosphoproteomics datasets, we stratified NSCLCs into those dependent on, or independent of, KRAS signaling by defining the S score that combines transcript, protein and phosphoprotein abundance in order to identify differential expressed proteins. We demonstrate that the S score outperforms nave integration methods and improves the functional specificity of the proteins identified as differential expressed. Next, we reconstruct targetable network modules associated with KRAS dependency by employing the Prize Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) algorithm to formulate the module reconstruction. This reconstruction identified three conspicuous modules centered on KRAS and MET, LCK and PAK1, and B-Catenin. We validated activation of those proteins in KRAS dependent cell lines and performed functional studies defining LCK as a critical gene to the cell proliferation in KRAS-dependent, but not KRAS-independent, NSCLCs. We further define a functional module of LCK signaling in NSCLC, in which LCK activates downstream proteins such as PAK1 in order to regulate cell death. Finally, we find evidence of LCK signaling in human NSCLCs tissues. These results are the first evidence that suggest LCK as potential targetable protein in the context of KRAS dependency. In summary, our integrative analysis establishes a novel mechanistic basis for KRAS dependency in NSCLC and nominates KRAS-LCK-PAK1 network module as a potentially druggable pathway in KRAS-dependent lung cancers.']",

We studied the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of AC after SR in stage IB NSCLC. Methods', ' Propensity score matching was performed on the National Cancer Database (2004-2011). The Kaplan-Meier method generated conditional probabilistic incremental 1- to 5-year survival after SR stratified by receipt of AC. Medicare allowable charges for SR, AC, and their respective complications were used. Decision analysis modeling and microsimulation were performed to account for proportions of chemotherapeutic agents administered in real-world settings. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated over a 5-year horizon. Probabilistic and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Results', ' 3662 of 18709 patient (19.6%) who met inclusion criteria received AC for SR stage IB NSCLC, with usage ranging from 15-27% annually. After propensity score matching, an overall survival benefit of AC was conferred over SR alone (at 5 years', ' 68.9% vs 60.4%, p < 0.001). The incremental cost of AC over SR alone was $11,541. The incremental effectiveness of AC was 0.28 life-years, with an ICER of $41,218. In two-way sensitivity analysis, AC plus SR dominated for the entire range of cost and survival estimates. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, AC plus SR dominated the model above a willing-to-pay threshold of $16,000. AC costs could nearly double and the ICER remained under conventional thresholds. However, only 3 of the 4 common AC regimens were cost effective. Conclusions', ' In stage IB NSCLC, surgery is insufficient to render a cure. The addition of AC to SR extends life-expectancy and is cost-effective compared to SR alone. These conclusions are valid over a range of clinically meaningful variations in cost and treatment outcomes, though a cost-conscious approach is needed when selecting an AC regimen.

Methods', '  Advanced non-squamous NSCLCs without EGFR mutations were eligible for inclusion in LC-SCRUM-Japan. The tumors were analyzed for ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions using RT-PCR, and detected fusions were confirmed by FISH. Between November 2013 and March 2014, fusion-negative tumors were further examined for other driver gene mutations using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) system (Ion PGM with Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel, version 2), enabling the simultaneous analysis of 50 cancer-related genes. Results', '  As of December 26, 2014, a total of 188 institutions across Japan were participating and 1347 patients had been enrolled in LC-SCRUM-Japan. Among 1271 available samples, ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions were detected in 24 (2%)/31 (3%)/55 (4%) cases, respectively. The NGS analysis was performed in 201 cases without the fusions, and 82 cases (41%) had driver mutations, including 45 KRAS mutations (22%), 10 BRAF mutations (5%), 9 ERBB2 mutations (4%), 2 PIK3CA mutations (1%), and 1 NRAS mutation (0.5%). MET and ERBB2 amplifications were also detected by the NGS in 4 (2%) and 2 (1%) cases, respectively. Among a total of 198 cases harboring targetable gene alterations, 16 with RET fusions, 26 with ROS1 fusions, and 2 with BRAF mutations were enrolled in clinical trials for vandetanib (LURET study, Japan), crizotinib (OO12-01, East Asia), and dabrafenib (BRF113928), respectively. Conclusions', '  This nationwide and population enrichment screening system enabled various rare driver gene alterations to be efficiently detected in advanced NSCLC, thereby contributing to the rapid accrual of matched patients in clinical trials for targeted therapies.']",

Furthermore we have investigated selected exosome miRNAs known to be related with NSCLC.  Methods', '  A total of 12 patients with NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) were included in this pilot project, after obtaining the informed consent.

Proteomic analysis for total and phospho-proteins was performed by reverse phase protein array. Results', ' BAY86-9766 was effective at reducing pERK ( < 0.001) but this modulation was not significantly different between sensitive and resistant cell lines (P = 0.64). MEK inhibition induced expression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including pEGFR, pHER2, pMET, pAXL, EGFR, VEGFR2, MET, KIT, IGF1R, and AXL (all < 0.001). This suggests a dominant negative feedback effect of the MAPK pathway on RTKs that is relieved upon MEK inhibition. MEK-ERK signaling is known to enhance stability of c-MYC. Moreover, c-MYC has been shown to be a negative regulator of RTKs transcription. Indeed, BAY86-9766 caused a decrease in c-MYC ( < 0.001) and phospho-c-MYC ( < 0.001) providing a potential explanation for the observed activation of RTKs in MEK-inhibitor treated NSCLC cells. The PI3K pathway was also activated in response to MEK inhibition with increased levels of pAKT(S473), pAKT(T308), AKT, and PI3K P110 as well as the AKT target GSK3 (all P < 0.02).

        "Background":"['The emergence of molecular methods for classifying solid tumors based upon specific driver mutations has made rationally-designed chemotherapy possible in a variety of cancers. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a prototypical example of these clinical advances, and is routinely treated with targeted kinase inhibitors including erlotinib and gefitinib. Despite the success of this approach, drug resistance continues to be a significant problem in patients with advanced NSCLC. Constitutive activation of STAT3 is a common feature in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and has been proposed to play an important role in tumor cell resistance to conventional and targeted small-molecule therapies. Previous studies have suggested that STAT3 can be activated in NSCLC by hyperactive growth factor receptors or cytokine signaling, though the interplay between STAT3 activation and other well-characterized oncogenic driver mutations in NSCLC has not been fully characterized. We analyzed the activation status of key growth factor signaling pathways in seven NSCLC lines with four distinct classes of driver mutations, including activating mutations to KRAS and several receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, MET, PDGFRA). Targeted pharmacologic inhibitors were used to evaluate the relative contribution of each oncogene to signaling pathway activation. While common downstream effectors such as ERK, AKT, mTOR were repressed by these drugs, we observed that STAT3 remained activated in all seven cell lines independent of mutational subtype. However, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of the gp130/Janus kinase (JAK2) signaling pathway uniformly disrupted STAT3 activation. Interestingly, only 3/7 lines produced significant levels of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which was previously suggested to be the key mediator of gp130/JAK2 signaling in NSCLC. Gene expression and ELISA analysis of other IL-6 family ligands suggests that cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor-1 (CLCF1) may be responsible for pathway activation in the other four cell lines lacking IL-6. At the functional level, treatment of cells with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib had little effect on proliferation and viability in two-dimensional culture, though it inhibited anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC cells in soft agar. Ruxolitinib also slowed growth of xenografted NSCLC cells, indicating that JAK2 activity is required for optimal growth of lung tumors in vivo. Together these results demonstrate that JAK2/STAT3 signaling operates independent of known driver mutations in NSCLC and may play a key role in growth and/or progression of lung tumors. We suggest that addition of a JAK2 inhibitor to therapies which target commonly altered oncogenes such as KRAS or EGFR will improve clinical outcomes for NSCLC patients.']",

We hypothesized that CGP could also potentially identify a TOO for some CUP patients, further refining potential targeted therapeutic options. Methods', ' DNA alterations from 44,065 samples that underwent CGP as part of standard clinical care were classified using logistic regression based on mutational profiles and select clinical features. Results', ' We first trained a logistic regression classifier to identify non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with alterations in EGFR, ERBB2, BRAF, MET, KRAS, ALK, RET, or ROS1 (lung gene set).

When applied to a set of 1352 CUPs with an alteration in the lung gene set, 425 (31%) were predicted to be NSCLC. We next trained a classifier to distinguish BRAF V600-mutant colorectal cancers (CRCs) from other BRAF V600-mutant cancers. The classifier correctly identified 90% of CRCs and 93% of non-CRC. Use of this classifier with a BRAF-mutant CUP data set predicted 32/87 (37%) of BRAF-mutant CUP tumors to be CRC.

When applied to BRAF V600-mutant CUPs, 37% were predicted to be CRC, and therefore single agent vemurafenib therapy is unlikely to be effective and combination therapy indicated. This approach is useful for identifying targeted therapeutics likely to be effective based on molecular match and TOO. We plan to extend this DNA-based tool to 4 additional tumor types.

        "Background":"['NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Based on tumor histology, NSCLC can be subdivided into adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and large cell carcinoma (LCC), which account for 40%, 25-30% and 10-15% of NSCLC cases, respectively. In a fraction of AC cases, driver oncogenes have been identified that enable effective treatment with targeted therapies. For most NSCLC cases, however, etiology is still unknown and effective targeted therapies have yet to be achieved. Additionally, even cancers that initially respond to targeted therapies eventually develop resistance, creating the need for other therapeutic approaches.EGFR is one of the best characterized driver oncogenes in NSCLC and also is frequently expressed at high levels in this indication. In house immunohistochemical analysis found EGFR to be highly expressed in 23.8% of AC (n = 21), 60% of SCC (n = 10) and 50% of LCC (n = 8), confirming published data that EGFR represents an attractive therapeutic target for NSCLC. As a novel approach to targeting EGFR-expressing tumors, we have developed IMGN289, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of the J2898A antibody (Ab), which selectively binds to EGFR and inhibits EGFR-driven tumor cell growth, conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1, a potent anti-microtubule agent, via the SMCC thioether linker. IMGN289 showed significantly enhanced cytotoxic activity, relative to cetuximab or unconjugated J2898A, against a panel of NSCLC cell lines dependent on EGFR signaling. In vitro, anti-EGFR Abs typically inhibit less than 70% of tumor cell growth at 30 nM concentration, whereas IMGN289 exposure approached 100% inhibition at a significantly lower concentration. Enhanced potency of IMGN289 against EGFR-dependent tumors was demonstrated in vivo in the H292 xenograft tumor model, where the minimally effective doses of IMGN289 and its J2898A Ab were 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, IMGN289 was effective against EGFR-expressing NSCLC cells that are not dependent on EGFR signaling and therefore resistant to anti-EGFR Abs. For example, IMGN289 was active against H226 and H1703 mesenchymal cell lines in vitro and H1703 xenograft tumor in vivo, while neither cetuximab nor J2898A alone was active. IMGN289 was also active against EGFR mutant HCC827 cell lines that have acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors through T790M EGFR mutation or MET gene amplification. Thus, EGFR-targeting IMGN289 achieves a distinct anti-tumor mechanism that is independent of EGFR pathway inhibition.In summary, IMGN289 is highly active against EGFR-positive NSCLC cells regardless of dependency on the EGFR pathway and represents a promising therapeutic candidate for NSCLC.']",

These findings suggest that psychological stress with the associated increase in systemic stress neurotransmitter levels and suppression of physiological agonists for Gi-coupled receptors may significantly contribute to the high incidence and poor therapeutic response of NSCLC. On the other hand, these findings suggest that stress reduction may have significant inhibitory effects on NSCLC. To test this hypothesis, we achieved stress reduction in athymic nude mice by maintaining the animals in larger cages and by providing them with several enrichment items, resulting in reduced systemic levels of corticosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine while the levels of GABA and the physiological agonists for Gi-coupled opioid receptors, dynorphin A and B and met-enkephalin increased. We found that stress reduction significantly inhibited the establishment of xenografts and significantly reduced xenograft sizes. Xenografts in the stress reduction group expressed lower levels of cAMP, VEGF and sonic hedgehog (SHH) accompanied by reduced protein expression of p-ERK, p-AKT, p-CREB, p-SRc and Gli1 while cleaved caspase-3 and p53 proteins were induced. Based on the observed reduction of the cancer stem cell markers SHH and Gli1 in xenograft tissues, we conducted additional mechanistic experiments with cancer stem cells enriched from three NSCLC cell lines under selective sphere formation conditions over 21 days with subcultures every seven days. We found that epinephrine significantly increased stem cell self renewal associated with increased intracellular cAMP, increased levels of the stem cell markers SHH and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 and increased expression of Gli1. Simultaneous treatment of the enriched cancer stem cells with GABA or dynorphin B completely reversed all of these effects. We conclude that stress reduction can act as a powerful inhibitor of NSCLC by restoring cAMP homeostasis and should be incorporated as important component into existing NSCLC prevention and therapy protocols to improve clinical outcomes.Supported in part by 5RC1CA144640 and State of Tennessee Center of Excellence for Human and Livestock Disease']",

Methods', '    Single-arm, 2-stage, phase II study in stage IV BRAF V600E mutationpositive NSCLC pts who failed at least 1 line of chemotherapy. Dabrafenib dosed at 150 mg orally twice daily. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria.  Results', '    The median age of the 17 pts was 69 years (range, 51-77 years). Most pts (12/17) were male, all were white with adenocarcinoma, and 13 were former smokers. All pts had failed at least 1 line of prior anticancer therapy, and 5 subjects had failed  2. At the time of reporting, 11 pts remain on therapy, and 6 have stopped therapy (5 with PD and 1 due to an AE). Thirteen pts were evaluable for efficacy. The best response for these pts included 7 PRs (5 confirmed PRs), 1 SD, and 4 PD; 1 pt discontinued due to an SAE (hypersensitivity reaction) prior to response assessment (ORR, 54%). The median duration of treatment for all 17 pts is approximately 9 weeks (range, 1-69 weeks). Among the 5 pts with confirmed PRs, duration of response was 29 and 49 weeks for the 2 pts who progressed, while the remaining 3 pts were responding for 6+ to 24+ weeks. The safety of dabrafenib in NSCLC pts appears to be generally consistent with what has been previously observed. The most common AEs were decreased appetite, fatigue, asthenia, dyspnea, and nausea, mostly grade 1 or 2. Five pts (29%) had a grade 3 AE, and 1 pt (6%) had a grade 4 SAE (hemorrhage).

During these transitions, cells can also adopt a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (hybrid E/M) phenotype enabling them to migrate collectively as observed during gastrulation, wound healing, and clusters of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). The hybrid E/M phenotype has largely been tacitly assumed to be 'metastable', i.e. transient state. Here, we integrate mathematical modeling with in vitro experiments to identify certain 'phenotypic stability factors' (PSFs) - GRHL2, OVOL2 and ΔNP63α that can stabilize a hybrid E/M phenotype. We show that H1975 (NSCLC cell line) cells can display a hybrid E/M phenotype stably and migrate collectively, a behavior that is impaired by knockdown of GRHL2 or OVOL2. Further, our computational model predicts that these PSFs can also associate hybrid E/M phenotype with high tumor-initiating potential, a prediction strengthened by the observation that the higher levels of one or more of these PSFs may predict poor patient outcome. Overall, our results suggest that a hybrid E/M phenotype need not be 'metastable', and bolster the notion that a hybrid E/M phenotype, but not necessarily full EMT, associates with aggressive tumor progression.\"]",

Results', ' Eighty-two percent of patients (72/88) had  1 ctDNA alteration(s) (median = 2 alterations), most frequently TP53 (44.3% of patients), EGFR (27.3%), MET (14.8%), KRAS (13.6%), and ALK (6.8%). Retrospective analysis showed that 25 of 88 patients (28.4%) had received a therapy matching at least one ctDNA alteration(s) (most frequently an inhibitor of EGFR (N = 18), ALK, BRAF, other). Sixty-five percent of evaluable (N = 5 patients, too early) matched patients (N = 13/20) achieved stable disease (SD)  6 months or partial response (PR). The median progression-free survival for the 25 matched patients was 13.9 months. For the 37 patients who had both the tissue NGS panel and the ctDNA test (median 1.3 months (range, 0.1 to 20.9) between tissue biopsy and blood draw), the concordance rate for EGFR ctDNA alterations with tissue NGS was 70.3% (k = 0.361), with higher concordance when time interval between tissue and blood tests was  1.3 months. When we only considered patients in whom ctDNA confirmed present (N = 27), the EGFR concordance was 77.8% (k = 0.526). Fifty-one patients (58%) did not have the tissue NGS test performed, including 33 (37.5%) who had no other tissue molecular testing, usually because of inadequate tissue or potential morbidity for repeat biopsy. Conclusions', ' ctDNA frequently revealed genomic alterations in NSCLC adenocarcinoma, including in difficult-to-biopsy patients. Patients who received cognate therapies demonstrated a high rate of SD  6months/PR, suggesting clinical utility.']",

Promising clinical responses have been observed in patients bearing tumors with ROS1 fusions treated with Xalkori, an ALK/MET kinase inhibitor that also inhibits Ros1. However, resistance has been observed and a ROS1 kinase domain mutation, G2032R, was identified in a ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC patient who developed resistance to Xalkori treatment. Clinical experience with other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggests that additional resistance mutations are likely to arise, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents that can overcome this type of resistance.We identified a novel chemical series of potent and selective Ros1 inhibitors with a unique DFG-out binding mode. The structure of human Ros1 in a complex with a ligand from this chemical class was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Here we describe the structure-activity relationships and synthesis route for this chemical series. A representative compound from this series inhibited isolated recombinant Ros1 kinase activity with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM. This compound inhibited less than 6% of kinases in a panel of 400 at 1 M concentration. Growth of Ba/F3 cells engineered to express Ros1 autophosphorylation in HCC78 NSCLC cells that harbor a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion were inhibited at similar concentrations as the isolated protein. This activity translated into potent Ba/F3-Ros1 tumor growth inhibition in mice. This compound was also active on Ba/F3 cells containing Ros1 with a mutation in the gatekeeper residue, L2026M, in cell growth assays in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, this unique binding mode provides scope for activity on additional Ros1 mutations that confer resistance to Xalkori, such as the clinically relevant G2032R mutation. The results shown here describe a novel chemical series with a unique binding mode that has potential for activity in Ros1 driven tumors with mutations that confer resistance to Xalkori.']",

Survival was calculated from time of enrollment and differences were tested with Cox proportional hazards models.  Results', '  Over a quarter (41/151) had PD at baseline, but only 21 met diagnostic criteria for MDS. Depression rates were balanced between trial arms.

In melanoma, a correlation between development of irAE and clinical benefit has been suggested. For NSCLC, the risk of irAE including pneumonitis has been described in clinical trials but not for the wider population. Risk factors for irAE and the impact of irAE on OS are unknown. Methods', ' A retrospective review of patients with NSCLC treated with single-agent IO between September 2014 and June 2016 was carried out at The Ohio State University. Patients had confirmed pathologic disease and received IO either on clinical trial or as standard of care. IrAE were assessed based on the treating physician diagnosis. OS was calculated from the date of initiation of IO to death from any cause or date or last follow-up. Results', ' A total of 90 patients met criteria. Median age was 67. Histology was nonsquamous in 58 (64%) and squamous in 32 (35%). Most patients received nivolumab (n = 87). Median months of IO was 2.6 (95% CI 1.9  4.2). IrAE occurred in 24 patients (26.67%). The most common irAE were pneumonitis (n = 8), thyroid dysfunction (n = 6), and rash/pruritus (n = 5). Other irAE included colitis in 2 patients and new onset diabetes and autoimmune hepatitis in 1 patient each. Development of pneumonitis did not have a statistically significant impact on overall survival (median OS 5.8 vs 8.1 months, p = 0.11). Prior thoracic radiation (TR) was not associated with pneumonitis (11.54% vs 8.33%, p = 0.69), but was associated with shorter survival (median OS 3.9 vs 8.7 months, p = 0.018). Development of irAE was not associated with histology (p = 1.00), KRAS mutation (p = 0.10), TP53 mutation (p = 0.09), or recent flu vaccination (p = 1.00). Patients with irAE had longer median OS (13.2 vs 5.8 months, p = 0.018). Conclusions', ' The incidence of irAE and pneumonitis match that seen in published clinical trials.

To date, the most widely employed techniques to detect CTCs use EpCAM based enrichment protocols. However, those assays are only able to find CTCs in a minority of patients with NSCLC, thus limiting its potential applicability. We are reporting performance of a new enrichment-free HD-CTC assay in patients with NSCLC.  Methods', '    This multi-institutional study recruited patients with all stages of NSCLC. Blood was collected at the time of the study entry, 3 weeks, 3m, 6m, 9m, and 12 m. CTCs were identified with enrichment free fluorescent labeling followed by automated digital microscopy. CTCs were physically and morphologically characterized by cytokeratin (CK) intensity, nuclear size, apoptotic changes, and aggregate formation. Cells were classified as HD-CTCs if they met strict morphologic and immunofluorescence characteristics.  This assay has been previously validated in 15 normal controls.  Results', '    106 patients were recruited (I-10, II-3, III-34, IV-59), 78 were chemotherapy nave. 85%, 79%, and 53% of patients with stages, I+II, III, and IV had detectable HD-CTCs. The chemotherapy nave cohort had median HD-CTCs of 4.4/mL (range 0515.6) and a mean of 44.1 (95.2)/mL. No significant differences were detected in median HD-CTC count between tumor stages (p = 0.32). CK intensity, nuclear size, frequency of apoptosis and aggregate formation was also similar across stages. 28 patients with stage IV disease were analyzed with multiple draws over time. Mean CTC counts were averaged over multiple draws. In each individual patient there was a trend for increased CTC prevalence with advancement of the disease. Median survival was 244 days for patients with 5 CTC/mL vs. 304 days for patients with < 5 CTC/mL. HR 4.0, (p=0.0084).  Conclusions', '   The HD-CTC assay can detect CTCs in a high percentage of patients with early and advanced NSCLC. Small subset analysis demonstrated the prognostic value for the enumeration of HD-CTCs.

We report the early safety data of combining atezo added sequentially after standard concomitant chemoradiation (CRT) for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC). Methods', ' This is a phase II study in LA-NSCLC assessing the safety and feasibility of adding atezo to CRT in two parts', ' I) sequentially (N = 10) with CP after completing CRT, or II) concurrently (N = 30) with CRT followed by consolidation atezo with CP. We report on the early toxicity results from part I of the trial. Atezo was given at 1200 mg IV Q3 weeks with consolidation CP for 2 cycles after CRT followed by atezo monotherapy for up to one year. Radiation dose at 60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions was combined with weekly low dose CP, followed by 2 cycles of full dose CP. Dose limiting toxicities were defined as any adverse events (AEs)  grade 3 within 15 weeks of start of therapy or any immune-related AEs during atezo treatment. Results', ' From January to December 2016, 10 evaluable patients were enrolled. Seven patients have received consolidation atezo ranging from 1 to 14 doses, with 3 yet to receive atezo after completing CRT. Three patients reported potential immune-related AEs. One patient developed grade 3 arthralgia, and another developed grade 2 radiation-induced pneumonitis, which resolved with steroids. A third patient who experienced grade 3 dyspnea due to COPD exacerbation after 1 dose of atezo discontinued additional therapy. Of the 7 patients who have received atezo, 2 patients developed progression of disease after 6 and 8 doses of atezo.

Evidence suggests that a fraction of EGFR mutant NSCLC might have intra-tumor heterogeneity which could potentially affect response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We performed next generation sequencing (NGS)-based analysis of a large cohort of Italian EGFR mutant NSCLC to assess the level of intra-tumor heterogeneity.Materials and methods. Genomic DNA from EGFR mutant NSCLC samples as assessed with routine diagnostic methods (N. 181; 141 tissue specimens and 40 cytology samples), was retrospectively analyzed with the Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer Panel using Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing. The panel assesses over 500 somatic mutations in 22 genes at a sensitivity of 2%. Variants with allelic frequency >2% and <5% were confirmed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), if material was available.Results. Analysis of EGFR mutant samples with NGS revealed the presence of two different hotspot EGFR mutations in 17/181 cases (9.4%). In 11 cases a EGFR sensitizing mutation and the p.T790M resistance mutation were detected; 6 tumors carried two different EGFR activating mutations at different allelic frequency. In addition, the presence of at least one variant in genes other than the EGFR was observed in 84/181 cases (46.4%), with TP53 being the most frequent mutant gene in EGFR mutant NSCLC (32/181; 17.7%). In 42 samples (23.2%) hotspot mutations were found in genes other than the EGFR, such as KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PIK3CA or MET, which might cause primary resistance to EGFR targeting drugs. In 29 samples the additional mutations were at an allelic frequency >5%, and in 13 at a frequency >2% and <5%. All mutations at low allelic frequency for which material was available were confirmed by ddPCR (N.5). The allele frequency of the driver EGFR mutation and of the additional mutations were usually different, suggesting the sub-clonal origin of some driver mutations. In particular, in 15/42 cases the EGFR mutant allele frequency was lower as compared with the additional driver mutation.Conclusion. These preliminary data suggest that a subgroup of EGFR mutant tumors have intra-tumor heterogeneity and are likely to carry tumor clones with different molecular profile. Follow-up data are being collected to assess whether this phenomenon might affect the activity of first line EGFR TKIs.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and in the world. Although a large fraction of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are dependent on defined oncogenic driver mutations, little progress has been made in the treatment of patients with the most common driver mutation, mutant KRAS. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, TWIST1, in KRAS mutant, EGFR mutant, and MET amplified/mutant NSCLC can induce either oncogene induced senescence or apoptosis. However, the key functions of TWIST1 that are required for its transcriptional activity in cancer are unknown.In the current study, we engineered domain-specific mutations in TWIST1 to determine the impact of altered DNA binding, dimerization and post-translational modifications on its transcriptional activity by luciferase reporter assays. Testing the promoter activity at three TWIST1-regulated loci involved in tumorigenesis, YBX1, SNAI2, and FLIP, we found that DNA binding and nuclear localization were uniformly required for TWIST1 transcriptional function. However, phosphorylation, TWIST1 box function, and ability to form homo- versus hetero- dimers impacted TWIST1 activity in a locus-specific manner. Previous studies have demonstrated that TWIST1 dimerizes with the E2A proteins, E12 and E47. We have shown that silencing of E2A phenocopies loss of TWIST1 in NSCLC and that formation of the TWIST1-E2A heterodimer results in a reciprocal stabilization of the binding partner. Therefore, we sought to determine how differential dimerization by TWIST1 might modulate tumorigenic gene expression. We utilized tethered TWIST1 dimers with either TWIST1 or the E2A proteins to form TWIST1-TWIST1 (homodimer), TWIST1-E12 or -E47 (heterodimers), and tested their transcriptional activities at several TWIST1-regulated promoters. We found that TWIST1-E2A heterodimers could enhance TWIST1 transcriptional activity compared to that of the TWIST-TWIST homodimer. In addition, we determined that the TWIST-E2A heterodimer is degraded by harmine, a harmala alkaloid that we have shown degrades TWIST1, whereas the TWIST-TWIST homodimer is resistant to harmine degradation. This suggests that the TWIST1-E2A heterodimer is the key target of harmine. Furthermore, we have found that overexpression of the TWIST1, E2A proteins, or the TWIST1-E2A heterodimer is able to partially rescue harmine induced cytotoxicity in KRAS mutant NSCLC. Taken together, these data suggest that E2A is essential for TWIST1 mediated tumorigenesis and that targeting of the TWIST1-E2A axis may be an effective therapeutic strategy against oncogene-driven NSCLC.']",

Mutations in KEAP1 are described for diverse tumor entities with a relatively high frequency causing an increased level of NFE2L2.

        "Background":"['Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which play an important role in cell signal transduction, are proven therapeutic targets for the treatment of human cancers. Axl and Mer are members of the TAM family which also includes Tyro-3. Axl has been established as a strong drug target candidate for therapeutic inhibition of cancer invasion and dissemination. As metastatic disease is the most frequent cause of cancer patient mortality, therapeutics specifically aimed at inhibiting metastatic dissemination and colonization would be important additions to the arsenal of drugs in clinical use. Some FDA-approved or in clinical trial molecules block Axl and Mer activity, however, there is no inhibitor clearly designed to inhibit Axl and Mer on the market. As a potential new therapy against malignant tumor, the development of Axl and Mer dual inhibitors is of great significance.CT413 is a novel, orally bioavailable Axl/Mer inhibitor that is currently in our preclinical development pipeline. In biochemical assay, CT413 potently inhibit Axl and Mer with respective IC50 values of 4 and < 1 nM. Among 97 kinase screened, CT413 inhibited Met and Ron receptor tyrosine kinases with IC50 values of 3 and 9 nM, respectively. Furthermore, CT413 blocked the Axl, Met and Ron autophosphorylation in cells with IC50 values of 13, 34 and 540 nM, respectively, demonstrating high kinase selectivity in both biochemical and cell-based assays. CT413 potently suppressed tumor growth in BALB/cA-nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneous human tumor xenografts. For example, in A549 (NSCLC), SK-OV-3 (ovarian) and K562 (CML) tumor models, CT413 inhibited tumor growth with TGIs of 84%, 110% and 66% dosed orally at 30 mg/kg QD, as compared to the vehicle-treated group. CT413 did not inhibit CYP450 subtype 3A4, 2D6, 1A2, 2C9 and 2C19 (IC50 > 10 M) and showed no induction effect on CYP450 subtype 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4. Furthermore, the IC50 of CT413 at hERG sodium ion channel was determined to be greater than 30 M, indicating its minimal cardio-liability. CT413 exhibited good metabolic stability when incubated with human or rat microsome. Pharmacokinetic studies performed in rodents and large animals showed that CT413 had low clearance and high oral exposures across animal species. The oral bioavailability for mice, rats, dogs and monkeys are 133%, 85%, 83% and 68% respectively. The non-GLP 28-day toxicity studies in rats and dogs indicated that CT413 has an excellent therapeutic window.

Using primary cultures of human fibroblasts isolated from resected lung cancers we previously demonstrated that co-injection with cancer cells results in increased tumorigenicity and altered expression of ECM related genes in heterotypic tumors. To identify factors involved in the cross-talk between fibroblasts and lung cancer cells, microarray gene expression profiling was performed on 60 fibroblast lines from cancerous and normal lung tissue from primary lung cancer patients, including 25 pairs of normal (NF) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) from the same patients. Lines were also characterized for presence of the activation marker alpha-SMA and for in vivo pro-tumorigenic activity by co-injection with A549 adenocarcinoma cells.

Among factors expressed by fibroblasts, positivity for NOPE, MET, CTSC and CLEC2B was detected in the majority of cases (60-70%) and they were generally expressed at higher frequency by CAF compared to NF. In univariate Cox models, SNAI2 expression by CAF was shown to correlate with worst overall survival (p=0.0288) and we further identified association of CNTN3 expression by CAF with shorter disease free survival (p=0.0125).These findings strengthen the hypothesis that identification of factors responsible for proficient tumor-stroma cross-talk could be instrumental in innovative strategies for risk assessment.']",

        "Meeting_name":" TWIST1 is required for suppression of apoptosis in oncogene driven non-small cell lung carcinoma",
        "Background":"['A large fraction of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are dependent on defined oncogenic driver mutations. The most common oncogene driver mutation is mutant KRAS for which no effective therapies exist. In addition, acquired resistance to currently available targeted therapies for oncogene driver dependent disease is inevitable. Our lab has demonstrated that inhibition of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, TWIST1 in KRAS mutant, EGFR mutant, and MET amplified NSCLC can induce either oncogene induced senescence or apoptosis. The fact that a subset of oncogene dependent NSCLC undergo apoptosis following TWIST1 inhibition suggests that these cells are potentially addicted to TWIST1 and might be more vulnerable to TWIST1 inhibitors. Importantly, we have identified the harmala alkaloid, harmine, as a novel TWIST1 inhibitor which could inhibit growth in several oncogene driver defined NSCLC cell lines and decrease TWIST1 levels via degradation. Given that TWIST1 is rarely expressed post-natally, therapies targeting TWIST1 may have minimal toxicities.In the current study, we examine the key TWIST1 functions, target genes and apoptotic pathways that are required for suppression of apoptosis. We found that genetic or pharmacological (harmine) inhibition of TWIST1 resulted in apoptosis in several oncogenic driver dependent cell lines. TWIST1 inhibition resulted in cleavage of caspase 3, 8, 9, and PARP. TWIST1 inhibition resulted in increased levels of Bid, Bim, and TNFRSF10B, as well as, reduced c-FLIP and Bcl-2 levels. Conversely, we demonstrated that TWIST1 overexpression leads to increased levels of c-FLIP and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members as well as decreased levels of Bid. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or c-FLIP resulted in partial abrogation of apoptosis following TWIST1 silencing. These findings suggest that the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are important for TWIST1 mediated suppression of apoptosis. Preliminary gene expression analysis of NSCLC cells following TWIST1 silencing has identified multiple candidate target genes in these apoptotic pathways. In addition, structure/functional analysis of TWIST1 suggests that nuclear localization, homo- and heterodimerization and proper phosphorylation of TWIST1 are necessary for suppression of apoptosis. Remarkably, TWIST inhibition with harmine treatment decreased tumor growth in our mouse model of KrasG12D/Twist1 NSCLC as well as decreased TWIST1 expression and induced apoptosis.In summary, we found that TWIST1 was required for suppression of apoptosis in several oncogenic driver dependent cell lines. Furthermore, the apoptosis observed after TWIST1 inhibition is dependent on the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways possibly mediated through c-FLIP and Bim. Our studies will establish the molecular pathways that are required for suppression of apoptosis with the ultimate goal of identifying predictive biomarkers of response to TWIST1 inhibitors.']",

We developed a covalent mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor, EGF816 that potently inhibits both activating EGFR mutations as well as the T790M resistance mutation while sparing wild-type EGFR. EGF816 demonstrated strong tumor regressions in several EGFR activating and resistant tumor models in vivo. These include H1975 (L858R; T790M), HCC827 (exon 19 del) and H3255 (L858R) that are representative of the relevant clinical settings. In all of the models EGF816 inhibited tumor growth in a dose dependent manner and achieved regressions of established tumors at well tolerated doses. In single dose studies, EGF816 showed sustained inhibition of pEGFR, consistent with the irreversible binding mechanism of EGF816. EGF816 also performs exceptionally well in long term dosing studies providing durable responses in the preclinical models.

Studies have also demonstrated that OM can be effectively treated with stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the brain. We hypothesize that treatment of OM with SBRT and/or SRS and treatment of the thoracic disease with CRT will improve survival over palliative chemotherapy alone. Methods', 'A retrospective review of charts in the RADTRACS database at the Univ of Florida was conducted between 1/1/2010 - 6/30/2015 to identify pts with newly diagnosed stage IV NSCLC with 5 or less OM at diagnosis that were treated with concurrent CT and definitive RT (60-66 Gy) to the primary lung mass in addition to SRS and/or SBRT to the OM.

        "Background":"['Many of the patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutation who initially responded well to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) eventually relapse. In spite of many studies over the last few years to elucidate this mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, approximately 30% of the mechanisms of acquired resistance are still unknown. Recently autocrine signaling of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) has been demonstrated in NSCLC cell lines. And several studies suggest that the FGF-FGFR autocrine growth pathway could be an important mechanism for intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines with wild-type EGFR. But until now, no report has clarified the role of FGF-FGFR pathway in acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines with sensitive EGFR mutations. We have established a gefitinib-resistant cell line (PC9 GR), by serial exposure of gefitinib to PC9, an originally gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line (PC9 na). We confirmed that these cell lines did not harbor two well-known EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms, the second mutation in the EGFR gene itself, EGFR T790 and the amplification of the MET oncogene. We collected total RNA from both PC9 na and PC9 GR and examined mRNA expression profile, by using cDNA microarray analysis. We found the expressions of FGFR1 and FGF2 were increased in PC9 GR compared to in PC9 na. The growth of PC9 GR cells was inhibited either by PD173074 (inhibitors of FGFRs) or knocking down of FGFR1 or FGF2 by siRNA in combination with gefitinib. FACS analysis revealed that the combination treatment with PD173074 and gefitinib induced apoptosis more efficiently in PC9 GR cells compared to gefitinib alone. PC9 na cells and PC9 GR cells did not show any change in the proportion of apoptotic cells after treatment with PD173074 alone. To further investigate how FGF2-FGFR1 pathway affects resistance to gefitinib in these cell lines, the downstream targets of EGFR signaling including the MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways were examined. In PC9 na cells, the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, and AKT was efficiently inhibited by gefitinib alone. On the other hand, in PC9 GR cells, the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was not efficiently inhibited by gefitinib alone. However, the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK was completely and AKT was less efficiently rescued by gefitinib and PD173074 combination therapy. In conclusion, these data suggest the activation of FGF2-FGFR1 signaling pathway contributes to the gefitinib resistance in PC9 GR. FGF2-FGFR1 pathway will be a therapeutic target for a subset of NSCLC that acquires EGFR-TKI resistance.']",

Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

Recent studies have shown certain germline polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with clinical outcome in advanced breast cancer pts treated with paclitaxel plus bev and in advanced colorectal cancer pts treated with first line 5-FU or capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin and bev. A study also found 2 SNPs in WNK1 gene were associated with bev-induced hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that SNPs involved in angiogenesis pathway (VEGF, EGF, EGFR, IL-8, KDR, ICAM1, FGFR4), DNA repair pathway (ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1, GSTP1) and WNK1 may predict clinical outcome in a subset of pts enrolled on E4599. Methods', ' Of 878 pts enrolled, samples from 146 pts were available for the current pharmacogenetic study and only 133 of the samples (67 PC, 66 BPC) came from eligible pts. PCR-RFLP assays were performed on genomic DNA extracted from sera of pts. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time-to-event distributions. Multivariable Cox models adjusted for gender, PS, stage, adrenal, liver and bone mets were separately fitted for each SNP to obtain estimates of hazard ratios. Results', \" Median OS for the 133 patients was 10.3 mos (8.2-15.6) for PC and 13.0 mos (10.2-16.6) for BPC. Median PFS was 4.6 mos (3.6-5.6) for PC & 6.5 mos (5.4-8.3) for BPC. Pts with mutant homozygote CC genotype for ICAM1 T469C had significantly higher tumor response rate (39%) than heterozygote CT (13%) and homozygote TT (20%) genotype (Fisher's test, p=0.04).

We assessed CSF as a liquid biopsy media and compared to matched plasma. Methods', ' We performed capture-based ultra deep sequencing on ctDNA derived from matched CSF, plasma of 40 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with suspected leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) using a panel consisting of 168 genes. Results', ' Among the 40 suspected LC cases, 35 were confirmed to have LC, ctDNA in CSF from the 5 non-LC cases are all undetectable. Circulating tumor DNA was detected in 93.8% of CSF and 66.7% of plasma. We compared mutation profiles and identified 86 and 46 SNVs from CSF and plasma, respectively, with 42 SNVs overlapping. Furthermore, ctDNA from CSF revealed many copy number variations (CNVs) that were not detected from plasma (189 CNVs vs. 3 CNVs). The average maximum allelic fraction (AF) of CSF ctDNA is significantly higher than in plasma (56.7% vs. 4.4% p < 10^-6). Twenty-eight patients were pre-treated with EGFR-TKIs and developed subsequent resistance. EGFR T790M and MET amplification were detected in 21% and 39% in CSF, respectively, showing a unique resistance profile among leptomeningeal metastases patients compared to the general population. Interestingly, 60% of CSF samples harbor TP53 loss of heterozygosity, only 11% of which were detected in the matched plasma samples. Such heterogeneity may reflect unique biological themes for brain metastatic tumor sub-clones. Furthermore, 26 patients received molecular targeted therapy based on the results from CSF, and 23 reported alleviation of symptoms at subsequent evaluations.

We used a ctDNA NGS assay to detect SNVs in 70 genes, amplifications in 16, and select fusions and indels. Statistical analyses were performed for association between OS/PFS and ctDNA serial samples results. Here we report the initial interim analysis. Results', ' Of 44 pts, 32 (73%) recurred (PFS range 0-26.6 months) and 12(27%) had no evidence of recurrence as of last contact (1.9-43.5 months post-XRT).

While the 4 patterns of cfDNA fluctuations were not found to be prognostic in this interim analysis, the presence of specific mutations appears to correlate with outcomes, with reappearance of the driver mutations post-tx associated with shorter PFS. Using FDR cutoff of 0.1, NF1 mutations were associated with shorter OS (p = 0.07), and APC/ARID1Amutations associated with shorter PFS (p = 0.09) after adjustment for tumor histology or stage.

        "Background":"['A rapidly growing domain in present-day oncology is the development of targeted therapies, including several cMET inhibitors against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nowadays, cMET amplification is used as a standard biomarker for patient selection, however there is no clear cut-off value to determine amplification, nor is there a real consensus about the way to test this. More recently, splicing variants of cMET, which skip exon 14, are gaining importance since it has been shown that patients harboring this mutation can respond to cMET directed targeted therapy. In this study, we explored the occurrence of cMET aberrations and their correlation with cMET expression in a population of 155 primary EGFR-TKI naive NSCLC tumors. Since cMET is considered as important in metastatic behavior, we also investigated the correlation of cMET expression and amplification between the primary tumor and metastases. Finally, given the link between the EGFR and cMET pathways, the EGFR status was also studied.Samples were collected at the Antwerp University Hospital and the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw Hospital Aalst. The expression of EGFR and cMET was determined by immunohistochemistry (Ventana, clones 3C6 and SP66 respectively), while cMET amplification was examined by in situ hybridization (Ventana, MET DNP and CEN7 DIG probes). EGFR mutations and cMET splice site mutations were detected by Sanger sequencing. Significant correlations were tested using the Chi2 and kappa test (SPSS 23).In 146/155 tumors cMET expression could be determined; 73/146 samples showed high (2+ or 3+ score) cMET expression and 4/118 samples showed amplification (ratio  2). No significant correlations could be determined between cMET expression and histological subtype of NSCLC (p = 0.065), differentiation degree (p = 0.468) and cMET amplification (p = 0.214). However, a significant correlation was found between cMET expression, EGFR expression (p = 0.015) and EGFR mutations (p = 0.029). Splice site mutation regions were sequenced in 87/155 samples, all of which were wild-type. When comparing cMET amplification between the primary tumor and the corresponding metastases (n = 40), only one sample showed amplification in the metastases and not in the primary tumor. Hence, cMET expression showed a significant correlation between primary tumors and their metastases (kappa = 0.003).The overall results of our study are in agreement with earlier data. Moreover, we showed that overall expression levels of cMET in primary tumors and metastases are very similar despite large intratumor heterogeneity. In conclusion, this study shows that high cMET expression in most NSCLC samples does not originate from presently known genetic cMET aberrations. High cMET expression is likely to be caused by temporary changes in transcription and translation, influenced by EGFR-signaling, miRNAs or other regulatory mechanisms.']",

        "Background":"['Although a large fraction of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are dependent on defined oncogenic driver mutations, little progress has been made in the treatment of patients with the most common driver mutation, mutant KRAS. In addition, acquired resistance to currently available targeted therapies is inevitable. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, TWIST1 in KRAS mutant, EGFR mutant, and MET amplified/mutant NSCLC can induce apoptosis, which suggests that a subset of oncogene dependent NSCLC are potentially addicted to TWIST1. Importantly, we have identified the harmala alkaloid, harmine, as a novel TWIST1 inhibitor which could inhibit growth in several oncogene driver defined NSCLC cell lines and decrease levels of TWIST1 and its dimerization partners, the E2A proteins, via degradation.We examined the target genes and pathways required for suppression of apoptosis by TWIST1 and E2A. Genetic or pharmacological (harmine) inhibition of TWIST1 or E2A resulted in apoptosis in several oncogenic driver dependent cell lines. Additionally, treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in rescue of growth inhibition following TWIST1 or E2A silencing or harmine treatment. This suggests that apoptosis is the mechanism of growth inhibition following TWIST1 inhibition. TWIST1 or E2A inhibition resulted in increased levels of Bid, Bim, and DR5, as well as, reduced c-FLIP and Bcl-2 levels. Conversely, we demonstrated that TWIST1 overexpression leads to increased levels of c-FLIP and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members as well as decreased levels of Bim and Bid. c-FLIP appears to be a direct transcriptional target of TWIST1 as TWIST1 overexpression leads to transactivation of the c-FLIP promoter and is dependent on the ability of TWIST1 to bind DNA. Interestingly, the TWIST1-E2A heterodimer results in greater promoter transactivation when compared to the TWIST1 homodimer. Furthermore, knockdown of Bim, overexpression of Bcl-2, or overexpression of c-FLIPs resulted in partial rescue of growth inhibition and apoptosis following TWIST1 silencing. However, only knockdown of Bim or Bcl-2 overexpression was able to rescue apoptosis following harmine treatment. This suggests that apoptosis following harmine treatment only requires the intrinsic machinery, while specifically silencing TWIST1 also engages the extrinsic pathway.In summary, we found that the apoptosis observed after TWIST1/E2A inhibition is dependent on the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways possibly mediated through its novel target genes, c-FLIP and Bim. Our studies will establish the target genes of TWIST1 that are required for suppression of apoptosis with the ultimate goal of identifying biomarkers of response to TWIST1 inhibitors. We also aim to determine if TWIST1, through its apoptotic target genes, modulates response to targeted therapies or standard chemotherapies.']",

These driver mutations are not captured with IHC or FISH staining because in the majority of cases, the ERBB2 gene is not amplified and HER2 protein is not overexpressed.

Methods', ' We investigated 107 AC and 78 squamous cell carcinomas (SQCLC) for PDL1/2 FISH. Furthermore, AC were analyzed by IHC with the clone 28-8 stained on a DAKO platform. Cut-off level was 1% (  5% highly positive). FISH was carried out with the ZytoLight SPEC CD274,PDCD1LG2/CEN 9 Dual Color Probe.

Results', ' 28/178 (16%) of NSCLC were FISH positive, 39% (11/28) thereof fulfilled the criteria for high level PDL1/2 amplification (PDL1,2/CEN9 ratio  2.0 or average gene copy number per cell  6.0 or  10% of tumor cells containing  15 gene signals), 4% (1/28) for intermediate level copy number gain (  50% of cells containing  5 gene signals) and 57% (16/28) for low level copy number gain (  40% of tumor cells with  4 PDL1/2 signals). Overall PDL1/2 amplifications occur at almost equal frequencies in AC and SQCLC, 18% and 13% respectively, but high level amplifications are more often seen in SQCLC (7/78 vs. 4/107 in AC). FISH results were independent of KRAS, EGFR,ALK, ROS1 or MET status. 35/107 AC (33%) were PDL1 IHC positive (28 high, 7 low positivity).

Cell lines were divided into two groups with respect to EGFR-TKI sensitivity', ' highly sensitive (HCC827, PC-9, HCC2935, and HCC4006) and resistant (H1395, H1666, H596, H1437, A549, H226B, H1299, H460, H1792). We examined expression levels of eleven HER-family ligands_EGF, TGF, amphiregulin (AREG), betacellulin (BTC), HB-EGF, epigen (EPGN), epiregulin (EREG), and neuregulin (NRG) 1, NRG2, NRG3, and NRG4_in these cell lines. NRG2, NRG4, and EPGN were expressed at 39.5-, 31.4-, and 6.5-fold higher levels, respectively, in EGFR-TKI primary resistant NSCLC cell lines than in highly sensitive cell lines, whereas TGFA, EGF, and AREG were expressed at 0.22-, 0.3-, and 0.34-fold lower levels. Phosphorylation of EGFR was elevated in sensitive cell lines compared to resistant cell lines, but HER2-4 receptors did not evidence a difference in phsophorylation. These results suggest that the EGFR pathway is activated in sensitive cell lines, and HER2-4, which binds to EPGN, EREG, NRG2, and NRG4, might be activated in resistant cell lines. We prepared cell lines HCC827GR and HCC827ER, derived from HCC827, which acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib, respectively. We analyzed HER-family ligands and receptors using these cell lines. Compared to parent cells, EPGN, EREG, HB-EGF, TGFA, NRG1, and AREG were up-regulated in HCC827GR. Phosphorylation status of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 was not altered, but that of HER4 was increased in HCC827GR. In HCC827ER, EGFR binding ligands AREG, BTC, and EGF were down-regulated, while phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and HRE3 was decreased. However, NRG2 was remarkably elevated and HER4 and its downstream STAT5 were phosphorylated. These results indicate that HER4 and its binding ligands may contribute to acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. Considering these results, it is possible that the HER4-STAT5 pathway might be common to primary and acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. We continue to investigate its significance.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality. Squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC) is the second most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is responsible for ~100,000 deaths in the US and EU. Most SqCLC patients receive chemotherapy as 1st line treatments and have a high un-met medical need for new therapies. Therapeutic approaches that enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy would therefore improve clinical outcomes for this patient population. CDK inhibitors comprise a class of drugs that target the dysregulated cell cycle in malignant cells. Treatment of tumor cells with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib inhibits tumor growth by decreasing retinoblastoma (RB) protein phosphorylation and inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase transition. Based on promising clinical trial results, palbociclib in combination with letrozole was granted accelerated approval by the US FDA for the treatment of postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Like hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients, the vast majority of SqCLC patients harbor wild type RB and thus may also benefit from palbociclib treatment. Previously, we reported robust cytotoxicity and antitumor effects of palbociclib plus taxanes, including nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Nab-PTX) or docetaxel (DTX), in several preclinical models of SqCLC. In the present study, we extended our efficacy studies of this combination to additional RB+ SqCLC models with diverse molecular genetic backgrounds. In search of mechanisms of action underlying the observed combinatorial effects, we identified several novel mechanisms, including cell cycle checkpoint abrogation as well as reduction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α). Decrease in HIF-1α protein led to strong modulation of downstream genes involved in angiogenesis, resulting in reduced blood vessel size in tumor vasculature. Our results suggest that palbociclib enhances the antitumor activity of taxanes by abrogating cell cycle checkpoints and alleviating hypoxia in SqCLC.']",

Pemetrexed is given at standard dose of 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks to a maximum of 8 cycles while erlotinib is given at 150 mg oral daily dose on days 2-19 of each cycle. Our main hypothesis is that maintenance erlotinib in this patient population could extend PFS by 50%, from 3 to 4.5 months and we seek to enroll 78 patients by randomized phase II screening design to allow 80% power to detect such a difference. Standard eligibility criteria include progression following at least twelve weeks of treatment with single-agent erlotinib during which time the patients experienced a clinical benefit. 23 of planned 78 patients have been enrolled and current enrollment averages 1-2 new patients per month. An amendment to allow either pemetrexed or docetaxel as the chemotherapy base is under review to further enhance accrual.

        "Background":"['Treatment of NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations with EGFR TKIs results in anti-tumor responses to therapy, however patients ultimately progress on therapy due to the acquisition of drug resistance. Known mechanisms of resistance include secondary mutations in the EGFR gene (EGFRT790M) or MET gene amplification, however the underlying mechanism of resistance remains to be elucidated in 40-45% of cases. Previous studies provide evidence for an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a subset of cases that is not associated with the known mechanisms of resistance. In this study, we identify 2 models of acquired resistance to erlotinib that are associated with an EMT phenotype and a dependence on autocrine FGF-FGFR signaling for resistance. Evidence for FGFR pathway activation in the erlotinib-resistant cell population included an increase in FGF2, FGFR1 and phospho-FRS2. Inhibition of FGFR signaling using a small molecule kinase inhibitor or FGFR1-Fc neutralization of FGFR1 ligands re-sensitized resistant cells to erlotinib. Re-sensitization was accompanied by an inhibition of downstream signaling. In contrast, inhibition of AXL, a kinase that has recently been identified as an EMT-associated driver of erlotinib resistance in some pre-clinical models, failed to re-sensitize erlotinib-resistant cells. Our findings are consistent with autocrine FGFR pathway activation, as FGF ligand neutralization in the absence of an exogenous source of ligand can re-sensitize cells to erlotinib. Finally, FGFR pathway inhibition suppressed the development of resistance to erlotinib in sensitive parental cells. These data indicate that FGFR activation could potentially serve as a mechanism of acquired resistance to erlotinib in cases associated with an EMT and suggest that combined inhibition of EGFR and FGFR signaling could be beneficial in treating such cases.']",

Further understanding the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies provides key information for determining subsequent treatment options. Access to tumor tissue to perform either the initial molecular profile or at the point of acquired resistance, however, is often limited. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be used as a minimally invasive method for the detection and quantification of molecular abnormalities. We performed a prospective study to assess molecular alterations in the ctDNA of NSCLC patients in whom the initial molecular profile or profile at acquired resistance was unknown due to lack of tumor tissue biopsy or insufficient cellularity in the biopsy.Methods', \" Plasma samples were collected from 52 pre-treated advanced NSCLC patients at the Gustave Roussy. DNA was extracted from < 5 ml of plasma and analysed using Inivata's enhanced TAm-SeqTM assay covering regions from 35 cancer-related genes. Sequences were generated using Illumina sequencing. We also analysed plasma taken following treatments prescribed after the original molecular profile detected using plasma ctDNA.Results\", ' From July 2015 to October 2015, 52 patients were included (63% female, 37% never-smoker, 95% diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma subtype, 95% with stage IV disease, and 54% had EGFR mutant tumors of which 68% had mutations in exon 19 and 32% had mutations in exon 21). ctDNA profiling was successfully performed for all patients, and mutations were detected in 38 of 52 patients.

Acquired resistance to osimertinib had been observed clinically; an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance is needed. Methods/Results', ' We initially studied an institutional cohort of 86 patients (pts) treated with osimertinib for advanced T790M-positive NSCLC. 50 pts had progressed on therapy, of whom 25 underwent a resistance biopsy and 17 had NGS results available. 6 pts maintained the T790M mutation at resistance, of whom 3 also acquired an EGFR C797S mutation.

For the final case, we confirmed the acquired KRAS Q61K on therapy using serial plasma genotyping. Time to treatment failure (TTF) on osimertinib was 3 months median in pts with loss of T790M and 14 months median in pts with maintained T790M. To test the hypothesis that loss of T790M is a poor prognosis subtype of resistance, we analyzed 127 pts treated for T790M-positive NSCLC on the phase I AURA trial of osimertinib. Plasma drawn after progression was submitted for genotyping using droplet digital PCR. 88 pts had a detectable EGFR driver mutation and were eligible for resistance analysis. 45 pts (51%) had detectable T790M at resistance, 17 (19%) of whom also acquired a C797S mutation; the remaining 43 pts (49%) had loss of T790M and no C797S. Median TTF on osimertinib was 6 months in pts with loss of T790M and 11 months in pts with maintained T790M; among pts with TTF <5 months, 72% had loss of T790M. To study whether baseline plasma genotyping could predict the eventual pattern of resistance on osimertinib, we studied 30 pts from the AURA trial with pretreatment plasma genotyping positive for T790M and an EGFR driver. The relative allelic fraction (AF) of T790M was calculated as the ratio of the T790M AF to the driver AF. In 9 pts with eventual loss of T790M, the relative T790M AF trended lower (25% median) than in 21 pts with maintained T790M at resistance (38% median, P = 0.086). Conclusion', ' Different molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib have different clinical presentations, with early resistance being associated with loss of T790M and the potential for overgrowth of a competing resistance mutation. These findings have implications in steering pts towards suitable trials for overcoming resistance - pts with early resistance to osimertinib could favor trials targeting a competing resistance mechanisms (e.g. MET inhibition) while pts with late resistance could favor trials targeting EGFR C797S.']",

        "Background":"['Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) have greatly improved the treatment and prognosis of multiple cancer types. However, unexpected cardiotoxicity has arisen that was not wholly predicted by current FDA mandated pre-clinical tests. Thus a more robust tool to predict the cardiotoxic potential of these compounds is warranted. For this purpose, we developed a panel of in vitro tests in a clinically relevant human cardiomyocyte model that assesses drug impact on overall cardiac health (cell viability, apoptosis, and morphology), mitochondria and metabolic intactness (reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, AMPK activity, and lipid accumulation), and electrophysiological function (impedance (beat rate) and ion channel blockage). To demonstrate the utility of our panel, we examined the effect of 4 FDA-approved TKi with known clinical outcome on cardiac health. The 3 drugs with known cardiac adverse events (crizotinib, sunitinib, and nilotinib) all proved to be cardiotoxic by our panel although each showed distinct mechanisms of toxicity. However erlotinib, a cardiac-safe drug that targets EGFR and is used primarily in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), did not show any indications of toxicity. Surprisingly, the most cardiotoxic drug by our panel was crizotinib, an ALK/ MET inhibitor that has revolutionized treatment for ALK+ NSCLC patients. Crizotinib potently impaired overall cardiac health by increasing ROS and apoptosis but also impeded electrophysiological function by inducing ion channel blockage and reducing cardiac beat rate. Interestingly crizotinib also induced lipid and cholesterol accumulation which was shown to be correlated with increased expression of the sterol-regulatory binding protein (SREBP) pathway by transcriptome analysis. The multi-targeted TKi sunitinib (used in renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors) and nilotinib (used in chronic myelogenous leukemia) also showed unique cardiotoxicity profiles. In conclusion, our studies showed a distinct cardiotoxicity profile for each TKi that correlates with clinical outcome. These results suggest that caution should be taken with these TKi especially when used long-term or in the adjuvant setting. Furthermore, these effects may be exacerbated in patients with adverse cardiac genetic predispositions and studies are ongoing in our lab on patient-derived cardiac cell lines to investigate this possibility. This multi-parameter screening approach allows for a more complete assessment of the potential for drug-induced cardiotoxicity and may allow for earlier detection in the drug development process. In addition, understanding the mechanisms of cardiac toxicities may lead to the discovery of novel mitigation strategies and combination therapies to improve cardiac cell health during treatment with oncology therapies.']",

        "Background":"['BT1718 is a Bicycle Drug Conjugate (BDC®) comprising a constrained bicyclic peptide (Bicycle®) that binds with high affinity and specificity to membrane type 1-matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP; MMP14) covalently linked through a hindered disulfide linker to the potent anti-tubulin agent DM1. MT1-MMP is involved in normal tissue remodeling and is also expressed in tumor associated stromal cells. However, overexpression is linked to increased tumor aggression and metastasis. Specifically, over-expression of MT1-MMP is also associated with poor clinical prognosis and shorter survival times in patients with NSCLC and a range of other solid tumors. The Bicycle MT1-MMP binding element within BT1718 was identified using a proprietary phage display peptide technology consisting of highly diverse phage libraries of linear amino acid sequences constrained into two loops by a central tri-functional chemical scaffold. These MT1-MMP binding Bicycles exhibit a profound affinity and specificity, more often associated with monoclonal antibodies, whilst their low molecular weight (1.5-3 kDa), akin to that of a small molecule, aids in rapid extravasation and tumor penetration. Together these attributes make Bicycles an ideal format for the targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads. We evaluated the ability of BT1718 to bind to and kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in a panel of tumor cells. BT1718 demonstrated MT1-MMP target-specific binding and MT1-MMP-dependent cell killing of lung tumor cells in vitro as well as efficacy across a panel of lung tumor xenograft mouse models. For example, in the Met-amplified squamous NSCLC lung EBC-1 model, complete regressions were observed in all mice at doses as low as 5 mg/kg (iv) twice weekly and across a range of other dosing schedules, from daily to weekly. MT1-MMP-dependent activity was demonstrated by blocking target specific interactions through co-administration of an excess of unconjugated Bicycle binder, which inhibited tumour regression, or a non-binding Bicycle, which had no effect. Further evaluation in patient-derived lung xenograft (PDX) models indicates a similar activity to that seen in cell-line derived xenografts, with efficacy seen from 3mg/kg twice weekly and rapid full regression of tumors at higher doses. The molecular attributes of these Bicycles', ' rapid tumor penetration and specific binding, makes them ideal therapeutics for targeted delivery of toxins as Bicycle drug conjugates (BDCs). The small size of the BDC may offer a significant advantage to other targeted cytotoxic approaches such as antibody-drug conjugates due to rapid extravasation and improved tumor penetration.

Therefore, the EORTC decided to support a project to update the LC13. Methods', ' The study design followed the Phase I to III approach described in the EORTC Module Development Manual. Phase I generates relevant quality of life issues using a mix of sources, including patient involvement. Phase II transforms issues into questionnaire items. An international multi-center study investigated the feasibility of the provisional module (Phase III). Patients had to fill in the EORTC QLQ-C30 and a 78-item provisional lung cancer module generated in Phases I and II. Patients rated each of the items regarding perceived importance, comprehensibility, and acceptance. The 78 items were assessed against a set of pre-specified statistical criteria comprised of distribution properties of the items and patient ratings. Biometrical methods primarily included descriptive statistics and basic psychometric analyses (Cronbachs alpha). Results', ' A total of 12 centers from Cyprus, Germany, Italy, Israel, Spain, Norway, Poland, Taiwan, and UK participated in the Phase III study. 200 patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer were enrolled. Mean age was 64 years (range 3991). 59% of the patients were male, 82% had NSCLC, and 56% were treated with a palliative approach. 29 out of the 78 items met the pre-specified statistical. Initial psychometric analyses suggested a five multi-item scale structure (coughing, shortness of breath, side effects, tumor progression related to existential issues, surgery-related symptoms; all Cronbachs alphas > .70). Conclusions', ' The updated module retained 12 of the 13 original LC13 items and contains new items that assess therapy side effects of targeted therapy, radio-chemotherapy, and thoracic surgery.

        "Background":"['Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a pivotal mechanism contributing to cancer metastasis and has been associated with resistance to multiple cancer therapies including targeted kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EMT has been associated with an acquired resistance to the EGFR TKI erlotinib independent of known resistance mechanisms such as secondary mutations T790M or MET amplification. RTK-addicted cancer cell lines that are induced to undergo EMT with exogenous TGF- become resistant to their appropriate TKI. In vitro-based assays determined that the resistance is not due to exogenous TGF-, drug efflux, or autocrine/paracrine growth factor signaling. To identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities specifically within the mesenchymal, TKI resistant cells, we performed a small molecule screen of approximately 200 agents using the EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) HCC827 cell line and its corresponding TGF--induced mesenchymal derivative line. This screen revealed that the mesenchymal cells are cross-resistant to a variety of small molecules, including TKIs and chemotherapeutic agents. However, a small number of agents showed selective growth inhibitory activity against the mesenchymal cells, with the most potent being the dual Brc-Abl and Src inhibitor, dasatinib. Within the parental HCC827 cell line, we detected a non-proliferating vimentin positive sub-population of cells. Interestingly, when the parental cell line was co-treated with erlotinib and dasatinib the entire cell population was killed and drug-resistant clones failed to emerge after prolonged treatment. To determine the mechanism underlying the resistance observed within the mesenchymal cells a proteomic analysis was undertaken, which demonstrated that the focal adhesion kinase, FAK, is the most abundant differentially phosphorylated protein in the resistant mesenchymal cells that is specifically suppressed by dasatinib. However, specific gene knock-down of FAK was not sufficient to kill the mesenchymal cells or revert their sensitivity to Erlotinib suggesting that FAK alone is not required to maintain resistance upon EMT. These findings identify dasatinib as a potential therapeutic for treatment of erlotinib resistance associated with EMT.']",

This disparity remains even with advances in treatments targeting specific driver mutations that have improved outcomes for some patients. Although the relative frequency of these genetic alterations varies in subsets of individuals defined by sex, histologic subtype, smoking history and race, little is known about the occurrence of these mutations in African Americans. In this study, we characterize the spectrum of known driver mutations in 200 African American NSCLC patients and seek to identify novel somatic mutations in this population. Initially, the population was screened using the Sequenom LungCarta panel of 216 mutations in 24 genes known to contain alterations associated with lung cancer, RET and ROS1 fusion gene expression, and amplification of FGFR1. Whole-exome sequencing is being performed on tumors from those patients with no known somatic mutations. Paired normal and tumor DNA/RNA samples are being genotyped to distinguish germline from somatic mutations in both the screening and sequencing phases. Initial screening has been completed on 130 patients, with the remaining 70 underway. The mean age of the patients enrolled is 61.7 years, 58.5% are female, and 8.5% are never smokers. In profiling the first 130 African American patients, we find that only 28% of patients (N = 36) carry a known somatic mutation that is not present in the germline, far lower than the 41% reported in white patients in our previous studies. Of the identified mutations, approximately 23.8% are KRAS and 23.8% are PT53 alterations. The next most frequent somatic alterations are in EGFR (16.7%). The remaining alterations occurred in only 1 or 2 tumors and include EPHA3, ERBB2, FGFR1, MET, NOTCH1, NRAS, NTRK2, PIK3CA, PTEN, RET and STK11. Five percent of patients have tumors with two driver mutations. Half of the tumors carrying 2 driver mutations had concurrent alterations in KRAS and TP53. Patients with known genetic alterations were more likely to be female than patients with no known genetic alterations (p = 0.42), but did not differ in age, smoking status, pack-years, family history of lung cancer, history of COPD, stage at diagnosis or histology. Mutations in EGFR were responsible for the differences by sex. Exome sequencing is complete for the first 48 of the 92 patients with no known somatic mutations. Sequences are being aligned using Novoalign and GATK will be used for variant calling; results will be available soon. Genetic profiling of NSCLC in African Americans has the potential to both identify novel mutations, expanding the list of potential targets for tailored treatments, and aid clinical decision making in African American patients leading to improvements in outcomes.']",

After implanting 35 specimens, mostly from pleural effusions, several mice exhibited weight and fur loss. Histopathology revealed infiltration of the liver, skin and lungs by human derived T-cells consistent with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Subsequent pleural effusions were then subjected to CD45 depletion using a human CD45 microbead separation kit which eliminated the incidence of GVHD. Tumors from all three sources were allowed to grow and subsequently passaged only as subcutaneous implants in NSG mice. Molecular characterization of PDX models was performed using targeted next generation sequencing and tumor histology confirmed by H&E staining. Some established tumor models have also been propagated as cell lines in vitro.Results', ' 47 specimens were implanted with an overall take rate of 30%. The initial take rate was 22% but increased to 66% following CD45 depletion. We have established 11 NSCLC adenocarcinoma and 3 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) PDX models from patient samples.

This tumor harbors EGFR L858R with no T790M mutation, high MET and very high EGFR protein expression.  The patient is in remission following treatment with AFAT-CET.  In this model, we investigated the respective contribution of CET and AFAT relative to E on tumor growth and signal transduction.  Methods', '    Individual mice implanted with LG703 tumor fragments were randomized to E (50 mg/kg qd po), AFAT (20 mg/kg qd po), CET (10 mg/kg twice weekly iv), AFAT-CET, or vehicle control (n per arm = 12) for 3 weeks followed by a 75-day monitoring period.

Results', '    AFAT, CET and AFAT-CET resulted in complete tumor response (CR) during the 21-day treatment period; whereas E resulted in temporary growth delay. After cessation of treatment, E-treated mice progressed rapidly and AFAT-treated mice progressed within 2 weeks. Mice treated with CET or AFAT-CET remained in complete remission. At 6h, E and AFAT significantly (>70%) reduced EGFR phosphorylation as well as that of AKT1, AKT2, ERK1, p38a, RSK1 and p70S6K. At 24h, E-treated tumors had returned to baseline-like states for all factors, AFAT showed an intermediate response, and CET, alone or with AFAT, achieved the greatest inhibition of pEGFR with sustained inhibition of all downstream effectors.  Conclusions', \"   In the LG703 PDX model, CET and AFAT+CET resulted in CRs, mirroring the patient's response to similar therapy, associated with sustained inhibition of pEGFR and multiple downstream signaling factors.

We hypothesize that IMPT can be used in the diagnosis of LMST through identification of CSF CTC. Methods', ' Pts undergoing a spinal tap for suspicion of LMST were eligible. All pts had an initial MRI evaluation.

While nearly curative for peripheral lung tumors, SBRT also may present life-threatening toxicity for patients with centrally located lung tumors. Moreover, large, hypoxic tumors are at a further risk of radiotherapy failure with SBRT. The efficacy of SBRT application can be improved through the addition of agents designed to sensitize the tumor and/or protect normal tissue. To investigate and validate the response to SBRT, alone or in combination with radiomodulating compounds, it is necessary to develop a tumor model for image-guided high-dose irradiation of rodent tumors and normal tissues in a manner that closely mimics delivery of SBRT in humans. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a rat orthotopic lung tumor model with a solitary intrapulmonary nodule to study the effects of high-dose radiation.Methods', 'Adult female athymic nude rats were anesthetized, intubated and then placed on a ventilator (Inspira, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) prior to surgery.

Cells with high levels of hnRNP A2/B1 expression have also been reported to manifest multiple molecular features of genetic injury. The hnRNPs are a complex group of RNA-binding proteins which play a key role in mRNA processing', ' stability, splicing, export and subcellular localization and participate also in telomere biogenesis. To elucidate the mechanism that links hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression with lung cancer progression we have knocked down hnRNPA2/B1 mRNA in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549 with a stable siRNA vector-based system. Silencing hnRNP A2/B1 increased proliferation and decreased migration in A549 and H1703 cell lines. These changes in migration and proliferation in A549 and H1703 hnRNPA2/B1-silenced cell lines correlated with an increase of E-Cadherin expression in both cell lines at mRNA and protein level. This increase in E-Cadherin expression was accompanied with a down-regulation of E-Cadherin inhibitors Twist1 and Snai1. We have proposed that hnRNP A2/B1 modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cell lines that present a mesenchymal or intermediate phenotype such as H1703 and A549. It has been proposed that EMT may induce metastasis of cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. After metastatic seeding, EMT would be reversed trough mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) allowing tumor growth. However, mechanisms that regulate reversion of EMT are still poorly characterized. Interestingly, sphingosine 1-phospate (S1P) is an important angiogenic factor and regulator of vascular permeability. Microarray expression analysis revealed that silencing hnRNP A2/B1 decreases expression of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3), a pro-migration RhoGTPAse activating S1P receptor, in A549 cells. Therefore, Moreover, S1P also stimulates motility of cancer cells through S1P receptors. It has been described that S1PR3 regulates migration and invasion in breast, prostate and gastric cancer. In A549 cells, S1PR3 is the most abundant receptor for S1P. Here we report that down regulation of hnRNP A2/B1, in lung cancer cells, decreases S1PR3 expression at the mRNA and protein level. We propose that further study of the mechanistic link between hnRNP A2/B1, S1P function and S1P receptors may allow a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in invasion, metastasis. It may also provide new insights regarding the interaction between endothelial and epithelial cells and the regulation of EMT during tumor progression.']",

        "Background":"['Many available oncology therapies are targeted to specific proteins, the most notable examples being therapies targeted to EGFR and Her2. For targeted therapies to have maximal efficacy, it is necessary to identify patients whose tumors express the target protein. As more pathways and proteins are identified as tumor drivers and therapies are developed that target those proteins, and more patient screening tools are needed to efficiently direct patients to correct therapeutic regimens.While chemotherapy regimens are not often considered targeted therapies, protein biomarkers for chemotherapy efficacy have been identified; for example amplification of TOPO2A is known to improve response to anthracycline-based therapy combinations. Though many chemotherapy biomarkers have been identified, screening is not routine, and chemotherapy regimens are not being adjusted for individual tumor biology.To address the growing need for efficient patient screening using minimal tissue, OncoPlex Diagnostics has built a comprehensive protein quantification panel that allows for the simultaneous quantitation of multiple actionable proteins from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded patient biopsies using multiplex mass spectrometry. This panel currently quantifies nine proteins that are markers of targeted therapy (including ALK, AR, EGFR, HER2, HER3, MET, MSLN, and PD-L1) and includes the ChemoPlex panel, which quantifies chemotherapy biomarkers (ERCC1, FRalpha, hENT1, RRM1, SPARC, TOPO1, TOPO2A). Since 2013, over 270 biopsies from multiple indications have been analyzed for protein expression in the OncoPlex Diagnostics CAP-qualified, CLIA-certified laboratory, revealing large ranges of expression for many drug targets that are not routinely assayed.Because of the importance of TOPO2A in anthracycline-based therapies, which are commonly prescribed in breast cancer patients, sixty-two breast cancer biopsies were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 62 samples, 41 were positive for TOPO2A expression; ranging from 233-1750amol/ug. Of the primary biopsies, 80% of them expressed TOPO2A; however only two of seven liver metastases were positive for TOPO2A. These data suggest that anthracycline-based therapy might not be as efficacious in metastatic sites due to the lack of TOPO2A.Also of interest, quantification of FRalpha, a biomarker for folate-targeted therapies, showed a 50-fold range of expression in NSCLC cases, and TOPO1, the target of irinotecan and topotecan, showed a 10-fold range of expression in various indications, with 4% of biopsies having no detectable TOPO1.These wide expression ranges of known biomarkers suggest that certain therapies might have vastly different response rates based on biomarker expression. To derive the best therapeutic response to both targeted and chemotherapy regimens, it is necessary to understand each patient tumor biology individually.']",

Samples from 189 patients were analyzed, which included 26% squamous tumors; 27% with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 49); and predominantly localized disease (distribution', ' I = 91, II = 35, III = 58, IV = 5). Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis was utilized to quantify 127 total or phosphorylated proteins. Interactions between protein expression and the receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Cox regression was performed to determine the relationship between protein expression and recurrence-free survival (RFS).Results', ' Twenty one of the 127 proteins (16%) were expressed at significantly different levels in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Specifically, patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy had higher expression of multiple DNA repair proteins, including MSH2 (p<0.001), 53BP1 (p = 0.01), and p-CHK1 (p = 0.02), as was Rb (p = 0.01), which regulates the expression of several proteins involved in DNA repair. Thymidylate synthase (TS), a target of the chemotherapeutic agent pemetrexed, also showed increased expression (p = 0.02). In addition, there was lower expression of phosphorylated proteins in the PI3K pathway, including p-70S6K (p = 0.008), p-mTOR (p = 0.02), and p-PDK (p = 0.02). Finally, we observed an expression of proteins indicative of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), with lower expression of E-cadherin (p = 0.007) and Met (p = 0.03). Notably, there was also lower expression of COL6A, an excreted extracellular protein involved in cellular adhesion (p<0.001), and a trend towards significance in increased expression of stathmin (p = 0.06), a microtubule destabilizer that has previously been implicated in EMT. Finally, we found that higher expression of multiple proteins involved in DNA repair were associated with a reduction in RFS after induction chemotherapy, including p-Rb (p = 0.015), CHK1 (p = 0.027), and p-CHK1 (p = 0.049).Conclusions', ' The receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with higher expression of DNA repair proteins, suppression of the PI3K pathway, and an EMT shift.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Various strategies have been used to make chemotherapeutic compounds more tumor selective in order to increase their safety and efficacy, but they were met with only limited success. Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) and folate receptor mediated drug delivery (FRDC) are the emerging concepts in the drug delivery field, but they are limited to high potent toxins and narrow sets of indications. We established a novel tumor-directed drug delivery platform technology based on the unique property of Hsp90 inhibitors. One prominent feature of Hsp90 inhibitors is their ability to be retained selectively in tumor cells for a prolonged period of time. The difference in residency time in tumor against plasma and normal tissues is 10-25 fold. Moreover, the chaperone protein Hsp90 is overexpressed 2-3 fold in tumor compared to normal tissues. Combining the overexpression Hsp90 and longer residency of its inhibitors in tumor, a strategy to link anticancer drugs to an Hsp90 inhibitor, where the attached payload is released in the tumor selectively for prolonged periods, was conceived. Results', ' Though the HDC concept is applicable to most small molecule anticancer drugs, we chose a common topoisomerase-1 inhibitor (SN-38) for proof-of-concept studies. More than 100 Hsp90 inhibitor/SN38 conjugates were synthesized; we chose STA-12-8666 as our lead molecule based on its in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. The conjugate binds strongly to Hsp90 as determined by client protein degradation assays and has good stability in plasma of several species (human>rat>mouse). In xenograft tumor tissue distribution studies, we demonstrate that mice dosed once weekly with 50 mg/kg STA-12-8666 clear the parental HDC and its cleavage products, SN-38 and the Hsp90 inhibitor, from plasma and normal tissue within 24 hr. However, we detected 0.6 M and 0.3 M SN-38 in tumor at 24h and 48h, respectively. SN-38 was not detected in tumor at 24h or 48h with an equivalent dose of the SN-38 prodrug, irinotecan. Xenograft studies using multiple cell lines demonstrated superior efficacy for STA-12-8666 compared to irinotecan. For example, in MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts, STA-12-8666 produced 70% regression in tumor volume compared to moderate tumor growth inhibition by irinotecan with no regression. Similar results were observed in in colon, SCLC, ovarian, bladder, NSCLC, melanoma models. Preliminary toxicological evaluation of STA-12-8666 resulted in better or comparable toxicities to that of irinotecan. Conclusion', ' We designed a novel tumor-directed drug delivery platform by conjugating previously validated small molecule chemotherapeutics to HSP90 inhibitors. Our lead candidate STA-12-8666, has great tissue distribution profile, superior in vivo antitumor activity and better safety profile than the active control irinotecan, warranting its clinical evaluation.']",

Thus, understanding the early steps of lung tumorigenesis at the genetic level might facilitate the development of more effective strategies for the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer. Nearly 10% of lungs resected for adenocarcinomas harbored minute discrete foci of cytologically atypical bronchiolalveolar cells that are designated as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH). It has been postulated that these lesions represent an early stage in glandular neoplasia, which is now viewed as a progression from AAH to adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) to minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), although, the biological nature of AAH is poorly understood and very controversial. To delineate tumor clonal heterogeneity as a function of tumor progression in early NSCLC neoplasias, we isolated DNA from different zones of histologic progression within the same lesion and performed targeted next generation sequencing which targets a panel of 134 well-characterized cancer and pharmacogenomics genes. We found that mutational landscape varies significantly between the three groups of patients. The most mutated genes in MIA were EGFR and TP53. 4 out of 5 MIA cases harbored multiple alternations in EGFR catalytic domain and inactivating mutations in TP53 were found in 3 out of 5 patients. Furthermore, mutations in Wnt pathway genes were found in 4 out of 5 cases. Notably, mutations/amplification in Notch family was detected in 3 out of 5 cases (predominantly in the tumor invasive zone). In contrast to MIA, in AIS, only one case out of 5 harbors mutated TP53 or EGFR. Unlike in MIA, only one AIS patient carried mutated APC gene, suggesting that Wnt signaling plays insignificant role in AIS carcinogenesis. On the contrary, we found that AIS carcinogenesis heavily relies on alternations of AKT pathway, since aberrations in KIT, KRAS, HRAS, IGF1R, FGFR3, MET or TSC2 genes were found in 4 out of 5 patients. For AAH cohort we sequenced 25 independent lesions from 6 patients. Sequencing revealed that RAS and AKT/ERK pathways were most frequently affected in these lesions. In 3 cases we were able to track a possible cancer driving mutation from AAH to the primary tumor. This observation provides for the first time a direct link between AAH lesion and primary adenocarcinoma. Most of the patients in all groups carried mutations in genes associated with DNA repair and chromatin remodeling, suggesting that deregulation of the DNA repair machinery is an early onset event of adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis. In all groups our analysis revealed mutations in genes that have been never implicated in lung adenocarcinoma. Our study helps to understand the potential role of heterogeneous clonal events in the progression of early glandular neoplasms including the transition from non-invasive to invasive disease.']",
