Preclinical studies report a critical role of c-KIT amplification and mutations in mucosal, acral, and solar melanomas. Preliminary data from clinical trials of KIT-directed therapy suggest their potential efficacy in these subtypes of melanomas. Targeting KIT, PDGFR, and SRC family kinases (SFK), dasatinib has inhibitory effects not seen with imatinib and nilotinib in melanoma cell lines with the most common KIT mutation, 11L576P. E2607 tests the efficacy of dasatinib in treatment-naive or previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma with these subtypes. Methods', ' We plan to enroll up to 110 patients with acral (palms, soles, or subungual sites), mucosal, or cutaneous melanomas with chronic sun damage (solar elastosis in the skin adjacent to the melanoma). Solar elastosis must be confirmed centrally. Patients receive dasatinib 70 mg PO twice daily on an open-label, single-arm basis. Cycle length is 21 days, without breaks between cycles. The primary endpoint is objective tumor response rate for dasatinib using RECIST criteria. Secondary objectives include response duration, progression-free survival, and safety. Correlative studies include assessing KIT expression, amplification and mutation, PDGFR expression, and SFK activation in tumor samples and correlating these findings with response. The study is designed in two stages, with accrual open to molecularly proven KIT+ and KIT- patients in the first stage. If responses are seen only in KIT+ patients at interim analysis (n=56 patients), strictly KIT+ patients will be enrolled (n=22 in each melanoma subtype). If response rate appears unrelated to KIT status, with response rate of at least 20%, the study will remain open to all patients (n=110).']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma causes the greatest morbidity and mortality of all skin cancers and often harbors amplifications or activating mutations in KIT, a type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) involved in cancer cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. At present, no treatment that provide either sufficient response rates or a significant prolongation of overall survival are available for melanoma. In the last decade, several inhibitors of RTK (RTKi) have been developed for the treatment of cancer, however, a number of short-comings was observed. Therefore, novel TK inhibitors with improved selectivity were developed for the treatment of diseases associated with KIT activation. Masitinib (AB1010), a RTKi capable of blocking selectively KIT, is one such new drug. Using B16 melanoma subcutaneous graft on C57Bl6 mice, we demonstrate that Masitinib is able to limit tumor growth in vivo and increase mice survival. This anti-tumoral effect was not observed for other RTKi targeting KIT. Suprisingly, Masitinib has no effect on melanoma proliferation in vitro, suggesting instead that modulation on tumor environment takes place. Indeed, mast cells that accumulate in the tumors secrete several biologically active factors involved in the modulation of tumor growth. In vivo, Masitinib treatment completely abrogates mast cell maturation and migration resulting in decreased tumor invasion and down-regulation of several angiogenic factors. Using a mouse line deficient for mast cells (Wsh/Wsh), we confirmed that Masitinib effect is in part dependent of its inhibition on mast cell migration and maturation. Indeed, additional effect occurs on macrophage polarization leaning from tolerogenic toward anti-tumoral phenotype. Furthermore, in vivo macrophage depletion favored tumor promotion and reverses Masitinib effect on tumor growth. The results provided by this study suggest that Masitinib may be a useful therapy on melanoma by its dual role on tumor environment. It can block mast cell maturation and infiltration in the tumor site, avoiding the angiogenic effects of mast cells. It can revert tumor tolerent macrophage status leading to an increased inflammatory activity within the tumor microenvironment.These effects are not observed only on melanoma, but also on other types of cancer, suggesting the cellular mechanisms triggered by Masitinib occur in various tumoral process. For instance, a phase III clinical trial with Masitinib as GIST treatment is currently ongoing.']",

Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

We report only genes having probably or possibly damaging non-synonymous SNV (PolyPhen2 score >  0.45) by ANNOVAR analysis and nonsense mutations. Focused analysis for gene copy number alterations previously described in melanoma was performed using our previously published NGScopy package (Bioconductor). We considered analysis for gene copy number alterations if median coverage depth >  20X. We computed T/AN copy number ratio at the gene against the chromosome level.   Results', '     To date, 4 pts with all four tissues (PEB-AN) have been analyzed. Mean coverage depth was 68X and read quality was 37. 85% of reads were uniquely mapped. The 10 most frequently mutated genes across all 12 T samples were APC, ARID1A, CDKN2A, EGFR, FBXW7, KIT, KMT2C, NF1, PTEN, and TET2 (FDR <  0.0001). NF1 mutations were present in all T from 4 pts. All T from 3 out of 4 pts had mutations in BRAF (2 with confirmed V600E), PTEN, IDH2, TET2, CCDC6, PCSK7, and members of the ARID and KMT2 gene family. Both metastatic T from 2 pts had mutations in TRIM27, NCOA1, BCL6, and BCL10 that were not present in primary. All T from 2 pts and all T from one pt had >  30% amplification of the KIT and KDR genes, respectively.

Results', ' Using the Therascreen assay, we were able to detect a BRAF mutation in plasma of 28/38 patients, yielding a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 73.7% when compared with tumor as the reference sample. Similar results were obtained using the Entrogen assay, with a PPA of 68.4% (26/38). The 2 most common activating mutations, V600E and V600K, had a similar PPA with both Qiagen and Entrogen tests. For all patients with wild type BRAF tumors, the research was negative on plasma DNA with both techniques (negative percent agreement, NPA = 100%). The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA = 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions', ' The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills. The unexpectedly low PPA of dPCR was attributed to the limited amount of DNA extracted from some samples.

Uveal melanoma is characterized by oncogenic mutations in Gnaq and Gna11, which activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK). Furthermore, both primary and metastatic UM are characterized by genetic abnormalities, including the amplification of the chromosomal arm 8q and monosomy of chromosome 3, which are significantly associated with poor prognosis. The oncogene MYC, which is located on 8q24.1, is amplified in nearly 70% of uveal melanoma, and is also regulated by the MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulators have become attractive targets for cancer therapy. In particular, the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 has shown selective inhibition of c-Myc expression, followed by the suppression of c-Myc-dependent target genes. We examined the effects of JQ1 in a panel of 8 UM cell lines, including cell lines with Gnaq/Gna11 mutations (92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202, Omm1), a cell line with MYC amplification (Mel290), and cells without either mutation or amplification (C918, Mel285). The Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells were the most sensitive to growth inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of JQ1 (IC50=200nM), followed by the cell line with amplified MYC (IC50=1M), while the cells without mutation or amplification exhibited little inhibition. We also examined the biochemical effects of JQ1 treatment, which caused a dose- and time-dependent suppression of c-Myc as well as survivin, XIAP, ERK1 and E2F1, while p21and the pro-apoptotic protein Bim were induced in all the cell lines. Interestingly, JQ1 also suppressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and induced PARP cleavage only in the Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated a cell cycle arrest in G1 in all the cell lines and an apoptotic population in sub-G1in the mutant cells. Furthermore, treatment with JQ1 resulted in significant antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of uveal melanoma with Gnaq mutation.

Development of the small molecule inhibitor PLX4032, which specifically targets the mutated BRAF protein, offers a novel therapeutic approach by effectively blocking the activation of key signaling molecules of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such as Mek and Erk, effectively leading to arrest in cell proliferation. Provided that MAPK signaling targets the micropthalmia transcription factor (MITF), which is linked to the expression of various melanoma associated antigens (MAAs), we hypothesized that the inhibition of BRAFV600E can modulate the expression of MAAs. Since MAAs are essential in the development of a melanoma vaccine, due to their increased immunogenicity, altering their expression can be a useful immunotherapeutic approach to targeting melanoma. Using patient derived melanoma cell lines, which express various MAAs; our laboratory has developed a vaccinia virus based immunotherapeutic vaccine. These melanoma cell lines have been characterized by their status of BRAFV600E mutation and found to be either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutation. Inhibition of two key MAPK pathway molecules, namely Mek and Erk, denotes that the melanoma cell lines are responsive to PLX4032. Phenotypically, the cells invasive and migratory properties were also modulated upon treatment with PLX4032. Moreover, we observed that the expression of various MAAs was enhanced upon treatment with PLX4032. An amplification of gp100, MART-1 and tyrosinase expression on the RNA level as well as on the protein level was observed. Lastly, expression of MMAs was conserved in vivo following the analysis of melanoma cell xenografts in BALB/c nude mice.

Various methods have been developed to analyze DNA methylation levels, both across the genome and at specific loci, in order to discover and interrogate disease relevant loci for methylation-based transcriptional control. Methods able to quantitatively measure differences in DNA methylation between normal and cancer cells provide promising sources for biomarker identification and assessment.Here we report on the use of a methylation assay (Zymo Research's OneStep qMethyl) and digital PCR counting (RainDrop dPCR) to enable quantitative measurements of DNA methylation at specific genomic loci using small amounts of non-bisulfite converted DNA. MGMT promoter methylation measurements are used to illustrate the method's robust quantification of small percent methylation changes using low amounts of input DNA.Zymo Research's OneStep qMethyl Kit is used for the detection of region-specific DNA methylation via the selective amplification of methylated cytosines after digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. RainDance Technologies RainDrop dPCR system is a highly sensitive tool for precise quantification of nucleic acids using probe-based qPCR reagents. RainDrop offers unique analytical advantages for clinical diagnostics due to its exceptionally high sensitivity for absolute quantification and capability to multiplex assays, using a wide dynamic range of input DNA in a contamination-free and simple workflow. The combination of both technologies enables a novel, fast, and robust method for quantitative methylation analysis of small amounts of DNA.The DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) removes mutagenic alkyl adducts from DNA, and its epigenetic silencing by promoter methylation confers susceptibility to DNA-damaging alkylating agents in glioblastomas, melanomas, and lung cancer cell lines, and is increased in cancers including advanced gastric carcinomas, colorectal tumors, and triple-negative breast cancers. A sensitive, quick, and cost-effective quantitative method for assessing MGMT promoter methylation would greatly enhance the diagnostic potential for this candidate cancer biomarker.Here we show digital quantification of MGMT promoter methylation across the range from 0 to 100%, demonstrating a linear correlation that enables less than 15% methylation changes to be robustly measured using less than 20 nanograms of input DNA. This method provides a sensitive count of region-specific methylation percentages using an easy workflow. Continuing work will make use of RainDrop's unique ability to multiplex assays to enable combining MGMT methylation analysis with additional cancer relevant methylation biomarkers in a single assay.\"]",

This is especially true for BRAF inhibitors, were multiple mechanisms of resistance have been uncovered. However, the lack of dependable models to develop approaches to overcome resistance, poses a real challenge for clinical decisions on second line therapies. In addition, combination therapies necessary to achieve long term responses increase the number of possibilities to be assessed. In this study, we developed patient derived xenograft (PDX) models from BRAF inhibitor resistant patients and, after characterization, tested rational second line combination therapies in co-clinical trials.Fresh tumor tissue from 12 patients after progression on vemurafenib or dabrafenib was implanted into immune deficient NSG mice. Once the tumor grafts were established, mice were continually dosed with PLX4720 to approximate clinical plasma levels to preserve the resistant phenotype. Xenografts were then characterized for genomic alterations and pathway activation status using a targeted sequencing array and a reverse phase protein array, respectively. We found at least 2 and up to 9 known deleterious alterations in all samples, many of which have been described as conferring resistance. The protein array clustered into two major groups', ' MAPK pathway activated and PI3K pathway activated, again consistent with previous reports. Integrating these data allowed us to design rational combination therapies for in vivo testing. We treated a PDX model with MET amplification and high phospho c-Met with the BRAF inhibitor LGX818 20mg/kg QD, the MEK inhibitor MEK162 3mg/kg QD, and the c-Met inhibitor INC280 25mg/kg QD (all p.o.). Although INC280 alone led to significant decrease in tumor growth, only the LGX818/ MEK162/ INC280 triple combination led to complete and sustained tumor regression in all mice. Further, we tested a second PDX model with a MET amplification (albeit broader and lower) but baseline pMET on the protein level. In this model, INC280 did not show any antitumor effect confirming the specificity for c-Met and the importance of validating genomic data.In summary, using our BRAF inhibitor resistant PDX model pipeline we were not only able to identify actionable alterations in all models, but also to test rational second line combination therapies in pre-clinical in vivo trials. Genomic data alone might not be sufficient to accurately predict therapy responses and protein arrays were a valuable tool to validate deleterious alteration calls. This study represents an important step towards improving personalized medicine in melanoma, and highlights the potential use of c-Met inhibitors in melanoma combination therapy in a defined subset of patients.']",

        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignancy with high tendency to metastasize to the liver. The majority of UM harbor activating mutations in the G proteins Gnaq/11, and amplification of the oncogene c-Myc. Currently available drugs have shown limited response in patients with UM and there is an urgent need for new effective therapies. Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated that UM cells with Gnaq/11 mutations are dependent on BRD4 activity. BET proteins are epigenetic readers involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4 inhibitors consist of small molecules that competitively displace BRD4 from acetylated histones, resulting in the suppression of the MYC transcriptome and other BRD4-dependent genes. Here, we report that a novel clinical BRD4 inhibitor from Plexxikon (Berkeley, CA), PLX51107, induces high cytotoxic activity in UM cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. In cells with Gnaq/11 mutations, PLX51107 showed an IC50 of 250nM, similar to the pre-clinical compound JQ1. In contrast, PLX51107 did not have a significant effect (IC50>3000nM) in cells without the mutations. PLX51107 induced marked apoptosis in Gnaq/11 mutant cells, as detected by Annexin V staining and induction of cleaved PARP. It also suppressed the expression of BRD4 targets, i.e c-Myc, Rad51, and induced the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. In mouse xenograft models of UM PLX51107 significantly inhibited tumor growth. Since the MAPK pathway plays a major role in UM, we explored the combination of PLX51107 with a MEK inhibitor, and found increased activity in vitro and in vivo. All together, these observations support the idea that this clinical BRD4 inhibitor represents a novel therapeutic intervention against UM with Gnaq/11 mutations, and clinical development is planned.']",

        "Background":"['The elucidation of core networks driving tumorigenesis is greatly enhanced by studying tumors from multiple species. A comparison of tumors between evolutionarily distant organisms such as humans and fish offers a particularly powerful method to identify such core functionalities. In the past several years, the zebrafish has emerged as an important vertebrate model of cancer because it develops tumors that are histologically and functionally similar to the human disease. Overexpression of the BRAFV600E oncogene under the melanocyte-specific mitf promoter leads to a 100% penetrant melanoma in the context of p53 loss of function. We have previously shown that these zebrafish tumors exhibit characteristics of neural crest progenitors, rather than differentiated melanocytes, similar to many human melanomas which also overexpress the neural crest markers sox10 and ednrb. To identify the genomic lesions that are common to both species, we are performing RNA and DNA-sequencing of the zebrafish tumors and comparing them to human melanoma resequencing samples to identify common driver events. To facilitate this, we have developed technologies for both short and long term culture of zebrafish melanoma cell lines, along with normal tissue from each individual animal. One such melanoma line, ZMEL1, has been comprehensively characterized. RNA-seq demonstrated upregulation of neural crest genes such as ednrb, and pathway analysis indicated enrichment for ERK/MAP kinase and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, and these tumors are sensitive to inhibition by the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on tumor cell line and matched normal tissue to a depth of 39X coverage on the Illumina platform. A total of 5193 single basepair mutations were identified, of which 2% were found in the coding region, 41% in intronic regions and 56% in the intergenic DNA. Within the coding region, 25% were G>C and 18% T>C substitutions, with approximately equal number of non-synonymous to silent mutations. Coding mutations in several genes such as rps6kb1b and plb1 are of particular interest because of their reported mutation in human cancer as well. 35 regions of copy number changes were found, comprising over 600 genes, and these include amplification of known oncogenes such as SETDB1. Functional analysis of the genomic changes common to both zebrafish and human tumors is now being undertaken using in vitro and in vivo melanoma models. In summary, comparative oncogenomics between zebrafish and human melanoma provides a powerful method for filtering the vast number of changes down to a list of manageable, testable hypotheses. This method can be broadly applied to other tumors types.Citation Format', ' Richard M. White, Erin Langdon, Charles Kaufman, Ellen van Rooijen, Jennifer Yen, Peter Van Loo, Leonard Zon.

        "Background":"['Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are known for high MYC expression. MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine analogue and a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor. 131I-MIBG has been used for scintigraphic detection of neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma and melanoma) that specifically uptake MIBG by norepinephrine transporters (NET). 131I-MIBG is also used for targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Non-radiolabeled MIBG had been reported to be cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of its growth suppressive effect was not elucidated. Our previous studies showed that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. In this study we confirmed that MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma cell lines (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5, Nb69, and SKNAS), and its growth suppressive effect in each cell line correlated with NET expression in these cells. In addition, MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma stem cells derived from SKNBE(2)C. MIBG treatment of SKNBE(2)C and SKNAS resulted in an increase expression of growth suppressive gene (GADD45B) and genes encoding for biomarkers of favorable neuroblastoma (CD44, EPHB6, EFNB2, EFNB3, NTRK1). Treatment of MYCN amplified (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5) and non-MYCN amplified (Nb69, SKNAS) neuroblastoma cells with MIBG resulted in marked reduction of MYCN and MYC expression, respectively in dose and time dependent fashions. Collectively, our studies suggest that MIBG not only targets neural crest derived tumors, but also is a MYCN/MYC destabilizing agent.']",

        "Background":"['We have been interested in identifying MYCN/MYC destabilizers that can specifically target neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, melanoma, and malignant pheochromocytoma). MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Non-MYCN amplified neuroblastomas express high-levels of MYC, and prognosis of these neuroblastomas is very poor. Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are also known for high MYC expression. Interestingly, these neural crest derived tumors characteristically express the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This feature can be used to specifically target the tumor cells with agonists of NET, such as Meta-Iodo-BenzylGuanidine (MIBG). In the previous AACR meeting, we presented our finding that non-radio-labeled MIBG can suppress growth of neuroblastoma cells in vitro, and this effect is in part related to its ability to destabilize MYC and MYCN. We have also shown that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. Recently, it has been reported that Phenformin, a Type II diabetic drug, binds NET, suggesting that NET positive cells preferentially uptake Phenformin. It is also known that Phenformin inhibits the mitochondrial electron transfer system. In this study, we have investigated a possible effect of Phenformin on growth and MYC/MYCN stability in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. SKNBE(2)C and CHP134 neuroblastoma cell lines were treated with various doses (0-2.5mM) of Phenformin for two days. MTS assay was used to assess the effect of Phenformin on growth of the cells. There was a dose-dependent growth suppression of the NB cell lines tested. Phenformin was more effective against growth of SKNBE(2)C than CHP134 cells. The effect of Phenformin on MYC/MYCN expression in four neuroblastoma cell lines [SKNBE(2)C, CHP134, SKNAS, and SY5Y] was also examined by Western blot assay. SKNBE(2)C and CHP134 express MYCN, whereas SKNAS and SY5Y express MYC at high levels. Treatment of these cells with Phenformin at the dose of 1mM for 24 hours resulted in destabilization of MYCN/MYC, suggesting that the growth suppressive effect of Phenformin on neuroblastoma cells was in part due to reduction in MYC/MYCN expression. We are currently examining whether the above observations made in neuroblastoma are also applicable to other neural crest derived tumors. In addition, we are investigating how Phenformin-related mitochondrial dysfunction causes destabilization of MYC/MYCN in neuroblastoma cells.']",

        "Background":"['Tumor invasiveness and therapeutic resistance strongly contribute to the low (<10%) five-year survival rate for advanced stage lung cancer; thus, identification of novel interventions targeting metastasis and therapeutic resistance is a necessity. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) are two cell surface receptors known to be associated with lung cancer invasiveness and cell survival. Our lab recently demonstrated that Fn14 was over-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlated with activated epidermal growth factor receptor, and that expression of Fn14 modulated NSCLC cell invasiveness and metastasis. We hypothesize that elevated Fn14 expression can be maintained by c-Met activation, and that blockade of Fn14 can suppress NSCLC invasiveness driven by c-Met. Here we demonstrate that Fn14 protein expression significantly correlated with c-Met expression in primary NSCLC patient tumors. Fn14 and c-Met were more highly expressed in metastatic tumors compared to patient-matched primary NSCLC tumors, suggesting a role in the metastatic phenotype. To further elucidate the relationship between Fn14 and c-Met in NSCLC invasiveness, we employed two cell lines derived from a primary tumor (H2073) and metastatic lymph node (H1993) of the same patient. H1993 cells (c-Met receptor amplification) expressed significantly elevated protein levels of Fn14 compared to H2073 (low c-Met), which were significantly diminished in H1993 cells upon c-Met inhibition through SU11274 treatment. Moreover, exposure of H2073 cells to HGF induced the protein expression of Fn14. The elevated expression of Fn14 through HGF stimulation (H2073) or c-Met receptor amplification (H1993) was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with U0126, a potent MEK inhibitor, suggesting that c-Met-induced Fn14 expression may depend on MAPK signaling. To further elucidate the effect of Fn14 on global c-Met-induced expression, genome-wide expression analysis was employed to determine genes both over-expressed in H1993 compared to H2073 and subsequently suppressed in Fn14 depleted H1993 cells. RALGPS2, a gene over-expressed in lung tumors that induces of c-fos and OPRL1, a gene elevated in metastatic melanoma, were elevated in the metastatic cell line and subsequently suppressed with Fn14 depletion. In addition, shRNA-mediated depletion of Fn14 in H1993 cells attenuated cell migration and invasion by 45% and 40%, respectively. This work demonstrates that c-Met and Fn14 may play a critical role in NSCLC metastasis, and suggests that targeting Fn14 may impact c-Met-driven NSCLC invasiveness. Successful targeting of NSCLC invasiveness would have significant clinical impact on a disease that is deadly in its advanced stages.']",

Based on the published literature, these tumor characteristics were then associated with potential benefit or no benefit to the specific therapeutic agents.  All relevant published studies were evaluated using the USPSTF grading scheme for study design and validity. Assay methodologies included sequencing (Sanger, pyrosequencing), PCR, FISH, CISH, and immunohistochemistry.  Results', '  All common malignancies (10 most common cancer types in men and women) and 10 rare cancer types were well represented (minimum of 100 cases in each individual cancer type). Well established driver mutations and protein expression in common cancers were all identified with expected frequencies (e.g. HER2 amplification in breast, PIK3CA mutations in ER+ breast cancer, EGFR mutations in NSCLC, etc.). Importantly, unexpected new and potentially actionable targets were identified in common (e.g., 6.7% HER2 amplification in NSCLC, 1.6% KRAS mutation in prostatic adenocarcinoma) and rare cancers (e.g., 8.3% ALK alteration in soft tissue sarcomas, 10.5% c-MET and 26.4% EGFR gene amplification in melanomas, 16.3% KRAS mutation in cholangiocarcinomas, 10% AR expression in STS), as well in cancers of unknown primary site (approximately 4% of all tested cases).

        "Background":"['Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with various molecular lesions and drug response profiles within the same tumor type. Patient stratification in clinical trials based on molecular features has contributed to recent success of several targeted cancer drugs on molecular aberrations such as BCR-ABL translocation in CML, Her2 amplification in breast and gastric cancers, EGFR mutations and ALK fusions in lung cancer and BRAF mutation in melanoma. However, in most cancers, the molecular features which can be used for patient stratification are not as simple as a single genetic aberration. Multiple drug resistance mechanisms caused by various mutations in cancer signaling pathways can also increase the uncertainty of clinical outcomes.To increase the chance of success in human clinical studies, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) clinical trials (PCTs) have increasingly been used for predictive biomarker validation, resistance mechanism investigation and combination therapy selection. PDX tumor models have been demonstrated to have high correlations with human patients in tumor pathology, molecular characteristics and drug responses. Large scale PCTs have also shown consistency in results when compared to related human clinical trials.At GenenDesign, we have established over 1000 PDX tumor models and more than 100 resistance models against various cancer drugs. Many of these PDX models have been characterized at RNA/Exome sequence, gene expression, gene copy number and hot-spot mutation levels. We carried out our PDX clinical trials by testing multiple approved drugs and clinical drug candidates such as targeted inhibitors against FGFRs, c-Met/ALK, HER2, EGFR, cell cycle regulators, Ras/Raf pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, as well as chemotherapy drugs in biomarker-driven multi-drug multi-arm expanded PDX clinical trials. So far, we have accumulated more than 3000 efficacy data sets and associated PD samples.Analysis of drug response and associated genomic information from PDX clinical trials yielded rich information for predictive biomarker identification and validation. At the same time, many potential resistance mechanisms were also revealed. These information can make human clinical trial better prepared, more efficient and focused.
