        "Background":"['Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) represents a category of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas characterized by marked cellular pleomorphism, and expression of CD30. Two systemic forms of ALCL are defined by the presence or absence of chromosomal translocations involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23 locus. Among several pathways triggered by ALK signaling, it has been widely shown that the constitutive activation of STAT3 is strictly required for ALK-mediated transformation and survival.To discover essential mediators of STAT3 oncogenic activity that may represent feasible targets for ALCL therapies, we performed gene and miRNA expression profiling experiments in association with functional validation approaches. The transcriptome of STAT3 was analysed in ALK positive ALCL cell lines using a tightly controlled time course experimental condition, in which the STAT3 signalling was abrogated by an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA).Gene expression profiling analysis identified a selected number of genes (1730) specifically modulated by STAT3 silencing. A significant overrepresentation of putative STAT3 binding sites was found in regulatory regions of early down-regulated genes. Functional studies using a shRNA lentiviral library established that Interferon Regulatory Factor-4 (IRF4) targeting specifically affect cell viability of ALK+ ALCL cells. In contrast, forced expression of IRF4 partially rescued STAT3 knock-down sustaining the survival of ALK+ cells.In a parallel experiment, genome-wide miRNA expression profiling identified 48 miRNAs concordantly modulated by the inducible knock down of ALK and STAT3. Among these, we demonstrated that expression of miR-1792 cluster significantly reverted STAT3 deprivation, sustaining both proliferation and survival of ALCL cells.In conclusion, genes and miRNA expression profiling associated to functional screenings allowed the identification of new biologically relevant targets for ALK+ALCL. We speculate that IRF4 and miR-1792 cluster are involved in the lymphomagenesis of STAT3+ ALCL, and that their inhibition might represent an alternative avenue to interfere with ALK signaling in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas.']",

        "Background":"['Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that accounts for 10-20% of childhood NHL. The normal cellular counterpart of this malignancy is thought to be an activated T lymphocyte, based on the observations that tumour cells often exhibit clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements and possess cytotoxic granules containing proteins such as Perforin and serine protease, Granzyme B (GzB). Chromosomal translocations involving the ALK tyrosine kinase gene are the defining characteristic of this lymphoma. These translocations result in the expression of oncogenic ALK fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK), which are able initiate signalling events crucial for the pathogenesis of ALK+ ALCL. We have previously found that signalling initiated by NPM-ALK and the JunB transcription factor contributes to the phenotypic characteristics of ALK+ ALCL by promoting the expression of GzB. GzB is best characterized for its role as an effector molecule used by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells to kill virally infected and transformed cells; however, GzB can also be secreted from different cell types and has the ability to cleave extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Furthermore, GzB is expressed in some urothelial and bladder cancers and was shown to promote invasion of bladder cancer cell lines in vitro and GzB expression is associated with a greater level of tumour invasiveness in patients with urothelial cancer. Given these findings, and that NPM-ALK signalling promotes GzB expression in ALK+ ALCL, we hypothesized that GzB plays a role in the pathogenesis of this malignancy by influencing the interaction of ALK+ ALCL cells with ECM proteins. In this regard we hypothesize that GzB released by ALK+ ALCL cells can cleave ECM proteins which may affect the ability of ALK+ ALCL cells to adhere to these ECM proteins and may also promote tumour cell invasion. We have found that ALK+ ALCL cell lines express enzymatically active GzB that has the ability to cleave the ECM proteins, fibronectin and vitronectin. Furthermore, we have found that these cells also release active GzB and we are now examining if GzB expression influences adhesion of ALK+ ALCL cell lines to ECM proteins and whether GzB promotes the invasion of ALK+ ALCL cell lines in vitro. This work will determine if the expression of GzB is more than just a phenotypic characteristic of ALK+ ALCL, and whether this protein may contribute to the invasive potential of this lymphoma. If so, these findings may help to explain why tumour cells are found to be widely disseminated in ALK+ ALCL patients and murine xenograft models.']",

It may be sub-divided into cases with or without translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK), leading to overexpression of ALK. While the outcome for patients with ALK positive ALCL - particularly in pediatric patients - has been very favorable following doxorubicin-based therapy, ALK negative cases have fared more poorly. Approaches such as autologous transplantation have been studied in this group in an attempt to improve outcome (dAmore et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012).   Methods', '    23 patients with newly diagnosed ALK positive (15) and ALK negative (8) ALCL underwent treatment with 6 to 8 cycles of dose-adjusted infusional etoposide, vincristine and doxorubicin with prednisone and cyclophosphamide (DA-EPOCH). Both groups had similar IPI characteristics (shown below).   Results', '    19/23 (83%) patients achieved CR or CRu; 3/23 (13%) a PR and 1 patients had PD.

        "Background":"['ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)-positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) occurs predominantly in children and young adults. Their chemotherapeutic treatment leads to a 5-year overall survival amounted to 70-80%. The tumor relapses are often very aggressive and lethal and their underlying mechanisms are unknown. Therefore, there is still a need to improve current therapy. Crizotinib is the most advanced ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor already used in clinics for ALK-associated lung cancers. However, mechanisms of escape to crizotinib have been reported in cell lines and patients submitted to continuous crizotinib treatment. Thus, its use in frontline treatment for ALCL is hampered by the emergence of resistance. As autophagy has been proposed as a cell survival mechanism potentially involved in the acquisition of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor, we investigated here whether autophagy was activated during ALCL treatment. We demonstrated in ALCL that autophagy is induced upon ALK inactivation, as a pro-survival response. We found that different ALK inhibition approaches (crizotinib or ALK-targeting siRNA) combined with autophagy inhibition (chloroquine, 3-methyladenine or ATG7-targeting siRNA) compromised cell survival and cell growth. Altogether, our results suggest that crizotinib and chloroquine (two drugs already used in clinics) co-treatment could be beneficial for ALK-positive ALCL patients.']",

        "Background":"['Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive CD30+ T-Cell lymphoma that accounts for 2-8% and 10-15% non-Hodgkin lymphomas in adults and children, respectively. The currently used standard therapy for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK, a member of insulin receptor superfamily) positive ALCL has limited effectiveness, resulting in a substantial percentage of cases with poor outcome, either failing to enter remission or relapsing within a few months after starting the treatment. Thus, there is a clear unmet clinical need for developing novel, effective and safer therapeutic strategies for ALCL. Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is a nucleolar phosphoprotein, which functions as a molecular chaperone for proteins and nucleic acids. Approximately 50% of ALCL cases are positive for the NPM-ALK fusion chimera generated by the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation. The oligomerization domain of NPM1 in the fusion protein NPM-ALK, mediates the ligand-independent dimerization of chimeric protein, which results in constitutive activation of the chimeric tyrosine kinase activity leading to downstream signaling pathways responsible for the oncogenicity. Ceritinib is a second generation FDA approved ALK inhibitor for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Here we report the first preclinical evaluation of ceritinib growth inhibitory effects on ALK-positive ALCL cells. The NPM-ALK expressing ALCL model cell line SUDHL-1 used in our studies. Treatment with ceritinib significantly induced apoptosis dose dependently (10-50nM) in ALCL cells associated with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Mechanistically, ceritinib blocked phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream signaling effectors STAT3, AKT and ERK1/2. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that ceritinib induced G0/G1 arrest with concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases which was associated with decreased cyclin D1 and increased p21 expression. ALCL is also characterized by strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 (a member of the TNF receptor family). CD30 stimulation leads to NF-kB activation and the induction of anti-apoptotic mechanisms. In response to ceritinib treatment, flow cytometry data showed that reduced CD30 expression in a dose dependent manner. Altogether, these pre-clinical results demonstrate that ceritinib induces apoptosis in ALCL cells by inhibiting ALK downstream signaling cascade and support the rational for in vivo testing of ceritinib for the treatment of ALK positive lymphomas.']",

ALCL cells rarely express a T cell receptor (TCR), CD4 nor CD8 despite displaying an activated cytotoxic T cell phenotype (production of perforin and Granzyme B).

We treated ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, K-299 and SU-DHL-1, with various concentrations of everolimus and crizotinib at a fixed ratio of 1', '40 (0.5 nM, 1.0 nM, and 2.0 nM for everolimus, and 20 nM, 40 nM, and 80 nM for crizotinib, respectively). After 72 hours, the combination index (CI) values were less than 1 (0.596, 0.583, and 0.763 in K-299 cells, and 0.326, 0.616, and 0.271 in SU-DHL-1 cells, respectively) in all tested combinations, suggesting synergistic cytotoxicity of everolimus and crizotinib. Western blot analysis demonstrated that everolimus up-regulated phosphorylation of ERK Thr202/Tyr204 and AKT Thr308 and Ser473. However, this aberrant activation of ERK and AKT was attenuated by the addition of crizotinib. In addition, while everolimus selectively inhibited mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation, a marker for mTORC1 activity, the combination treatment more potently inhibited mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation and decreased mTOR Ser2481 phosphorylation, a marker for mTORC2, as well. Cell-cycle analysis showed that the combination treatment induced G1 arrest. PARP cleavage was also increased after the combination treatment. To test the hypothesis that our findings could be applyed to other ALK-positive malignancies, we treated NCI-H2228, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that harbors an EML4-ALK fusion gene, with everolimus and crizotinib for 72 hours.

Crizotinib was the first clinically relevant ALK inhibitor, now approved for the treatment of late stage and metastatic cases of lung cancer.

Lack of representative cell lines and/or models has compromised the development of successful therapy.Toward this end, we report the generation and characterization of a group of novel ALCL tumor grafts. We implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) tumor tissue fragments, fresh or viable cryopreserved, from 11 cases of primary systemic ALCL (3 ALK+ and 8 ALK-) in six- to eight-week old severe immunocombined immunodeficiency NOD Cg-Prkdcscid/Il2rgtm1wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. A single leukaemic ALCL sample was injected i.v. or s.c.Six cases led to successful lymphoma growth within 6-12 weeks as subcutaneous solid spheroid masses constituted by a uniform population of large pleomorphic cells CD30-positive. All tumor grafts were re-implanted in recipient animals, in same cases up to 21 consecutive implants with an analogous time growth rate. Two cases, in the same way of the original human neoplasia, were early associated with concomitant enlargement of multiple organs. All tumor graft lines eventually showed disseminate disease with involvement of distant lymph nodes and of spleen (with homig in peri-arteriolar spaces), liver (initially observed within the sinusoidal spaces) and kidney. The morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation (expression of CD30, cytotoxic proteins and ALK) of the serially propagated ALCL tumor grafts demonstrated a high concordance between primary and derived animal tumors which showed highly stable profile along different passages from the early generation (T1) until the final ones (up to T16). The clonal relationship with primary and corresponding tumor grafts was confirmed by gene TCR rearrangement analyses and by ALK FISH studies.In addition we interrogated the model using gene expression profiling and single nucleotide polymorphism which established a close relationship among primary and derived tumors. Massive parallel sequencing on mRNA transcripts defines the presence of two novel chimeras involving NF1-MAZ and TRAF1-ALK1, which confirmes the evidence of ALK signaling and pinpoint a role of RAS in ALK- ALCL.The tumor grafts displayed, also, therapeutic responses with conventional therapy (CHOP) which reflected that seen in the donor patients', ' initial partial responses followed invariably by clinical relapses. To overcome this refractory we assayed the sensitivity of two tumorgraft lines, generated from ALK+ ALCL, to a new selective ALK inhibitor (CEP28122) that led a rapid and stable response.

        "Background":"['Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a mature T-cell malignancy that is subdivided further into two distinct disease entities based on the presence or absence of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein. ALK+ ALCL bears the t(2;5) (p23;q35) translocation in greater than 80% of cases, which results in the expression of the chimeric nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK. This leads to the activation of many different growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic pathways, including PI3K/Akt1/mTOR, Jak/Stat and AP-1. Recently, micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as tiny but potent molecules to regulate cell differentiation and proliferation. In a recent publication we have reported that miR-155 is up-regulated in ALK+ and down-regulated in ALK- ALCL. We have now identified an additional miRNA, miR-146a, that is significantly higher expressed in ALK- ALCL. Both miRNAs are strongly induced by T-cell activation. We report here that in ALCL cell lines that highly express miR-155 (like ALK- Mac1 and Mac2a) its target protein CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein  (C/EBP) is suppressed and moreover reintroduction of miR-155 in cell lines that have low miR-155 levels (Karpas-299, SR786, SU-DHL-1, SUP-M2) can actively down-regulate C/EBP. Conversely, high expression of miR-146a in primary ALK- ALCL FFPE specimens corresponds to low expression of its target protein IL1 receptor-associated kinase 1 in ALK - cell lines. Due to the known roles of miR-155 and miR-146a we assessed cytokine release in a set of ALCL cell lines with and without the ALK translocation. Interestingly, we found expression of cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, IL-21 and IL-22 in ALCL cell lines.

Reintroduction of miR-155 into the ALK+ cell lines Karpas-299 and SR786 was able to enhance expression of IL-22.

        "Background":"['The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is an oncogenic tyrosine kinase involved in 80% of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL), and 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), among other cancers. The ongoing therapies in ALK+ ALCL, based on aggressive chemotherapy, are not optimal. One compound so far, the crizotinib, is used in clinics for the treatment of ALK-dependent lung cancers. However, the first mutations conferring resistance to crizotinib, have been reported and hampered its use for the treatment of ALK+ ALCL. Thus, despite the therapeutic success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer treatments, acquired drug resistances universally develop. In this context, cytoprotective autophagy has been proposed as the next target for elimination of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We recently demonstrated that cytoprotective autophagy is indeed activated shortly upon ALK inactivation in ALCL and that its inhibition enhances the anti-tumoral action of Crizotinib. A transcriptome analysis showed an increased expression of many genes from the autophagy machinery such as ULK1, MAP1LC3B, or ATG16L2 after crizotinib treatment in ALCL. Moreover, new preliminary results enabled us to identify a set of miRNAs differentially expressed in ALCL upon Crizotinib treatment. As miRNAs are known as fine regulators of gene expression, we anticipate that some of them could be efficient regulators of core autophagy genes expression. The aim of our study is to select a few miRNAs of interest and to confirm their regulatory role on the autophagic machinery. This could lead to the development of new therapeutical strategies which could ultimately help to overcome emerging resistances against crizotinib.']",

        "Background":"['We have previously identified two phenotypically distinct cell subpopulations in ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ALCL) based on their differential response to a Sox2 reporter (SRR2), with reporter responsive (RR) cells being more tumorigenic and chemoresistant than reporter unresponsive (RU) cells. The regulation of the RU/RR dichotomy remains to be elusive. Our bioinformatics analysis of the SRR2 sequence suggests that cMyc may be an important factor. In support of this concept, we found a substantially higher expression of cMyc and more cMyc and Sox2-SRR2 probe bindings in RR cells than in RU cells. Inhibition of cMyc in RR cells significantly decreased SRR2 luciferase activity, and overexpression of cMyc in RU cells significantly increased SRR2 luciferase activity. Correlating with this, cMyc inhibition in RR cells significantly attenuated the clonogenicity and sensitized cells to doxorubicin; while overexpression of cMyc in RU cells conferred to the potentiated clonogenicity and chemoresistance. Importantly, we found cMyc not only maintains Sox2 protein expression, but also promotes Sox2 SRR2 probe binding and its transcriptional activity. Moreover, we found the highly active Wnt canonical pathway (WCP) contributes to the high expression of cMyc in RR cells. Intriguingly, we observed a positive regulatory loop in RR cells, in which Sox2 up-regulates Wnt2B, which can activate the WCP and cMyc. Furthermore, the significance of cMyc in this context was further highlighted by the fact that RU cells with stably transfected c-MYC are phenotypically similar with RR cells in terms of the elevated activation of WCP and increased tumorigenicity in vivo. Lastly, we found cMyc is heterogeneously expressed in ALK+ALCL tumor cells (n = 5) by immunohistochemcial staining, and it co-localizes with active -catenin, a marker of active WCP, in tumor cells by immunofluorescence assay. In conclusion, cMyc is a key regulatory factor in the determination of RU/RR dichotomy, which is linked to tumorigenic potential and chemo-resistance in ALK+ALCL.']",

Recently, high-level expression of CSF1R on malignant cells in ALCL has been linked to shorter progression free survival, providing a rationale to test adoptive C28-mediated T-cell therapy. This approach encompasses the genetic modification of T-cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) named C28, a fusion receptor coupling the recognition of CSF1R on the tumour cell surface to the delivery of tailored T-cell activation signal provided by a fused CD28+CD3 endodomain. To optimize this approach for human translation, the C28 CAR was co-expressed with the chimeric cytokine receptor 4 (combination termed C4), which allows for selective expansion and enrichment of CAR-transduced T-cells using IL-4. PBMCs of healthy donors were isolated and activated using anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Following retroviral T-cell transduction and 14 days expansion of C4+ T-cells in the presence of IL-4, co-cultures with a panel of ALCL cell lines (2 ALK positive and 2 ALK negative ALCL cell lines) were set up to test C4 efficacy in vitro. Successful re-targeting of C4+ T-cells was confirmed by monitoring target cell destruction. Conditioned media was collected and analysed for IFN- and IL-2 production. Cytotoxicity, cytokine release and T-cell proliferation data demonstrated Ag-specific activation of the C4+ cells, which contrasted with T-cells expressing a control CAR with truncated endodomain.

Depending on the presence or absence of chromosomal translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK gene and hence the expression of ALK, ALCL is further subdivided into ALK positive (ALK+) or ALK negative (ALK-) types. NPM-ALK chimeric fusion oncogenic protein is found in around 80% of ALK+ ALCL, as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35). The current standard of treatment for ALK+ ALCL is combination chemotherapy. Crizotinib, an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the only agent available to target NPM-ALK in ALCL. The identification of other targeting agents would potentially improve the treatment outcome of ALK+ ALCL especially for relapsed and/or refractory cases. In this study, we investigated the effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on NPM-ALK in ALCL.MethodsWe treated ALK+ ALCL cell lines with various clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3 (0, 0.5, 1 and 2M) for 24 hours and examined its effects on NPM-ALK mRNA expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by Western immunoblotting. The downstream signaling pathway of NPM-ALK, phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705, was also examined. Next, we analyzed apoptotic cell death and growth arrest induced by As2O3 in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL cell lines using Annexin V-7AAD staining and cell cycle analysis. The effect of As2O3 on cell viability was also measured with WST-1 assay.RESULTSOur data showed that As2O3 downregulated NPM-ALK at the protein level without affecting the transcription. It also inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 in all ALK+ ALCL cell lines. We also found that blocking protein degradation through proteasome with MG132 abrogated the effect of As2O3 on NPM-ALK. Furthermore, As2O3 induced apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and growth inhibition in ALK+ but not in ALK- ALCL cell lines, with a GI50 of less than 1M, which was a level achievable with clinical use of As2O3.CONCLUSIONS.Our data demonstrated that As2O3 downregulated NPM-ALK by facilitating protein degradation through the proteasomal pathway, thereby inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in ALK+ ALCL.

Although ALK positive ALCL can be readily diagnosed, ALK negative ALCL still lack unique genetic features and their distinction from other CD30 positive Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas (PTCL) is not trivial. To unravel the regulatory network underlying lymphomagenesis of ALCL, and to discover new genomic classifiers for the recognition of ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL patients, we undertook a systematic approach of pathway discovery through a gene expression profiling meta-analysis of 309 cases, using data generated by five sets of experiments. In agreement with previous studies, unsupervised analyses were not able to distinguish ALCL from the other T-NHL categories. However, pathway discovery and prediction analyses defined a minimum set of genes useful for the stratification of ALK negative ALCL and strengthened the hypothesis that ALCL correspond to a distinctive pathological subgroup within T-NHL. Application of RT-qPCR in independent data sets of cryo-preserved and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples confirmed the gene expression profiling predictions and validated a simple model based on the measurement of three genes.

        "Background":"['Most of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) cases carry the t(2;5; p23;q35) that produces the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK. NPM provides an oligomerization domain that causes the spontaneous dimerization and ligand-independent activation of the ALK. NPM-ALK deregulated kinase activity drives several pathways involved in cellular proliferation and survival and sustains the process of malignant transformation. NPM-ALK is localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but the role of NPM-ALK cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions on ALCL phenotype maintenance is undetermined. We found that in all ALK+ ALCL cell lines and in primary ALCL NPM-ALK was equally distributed between cytoplasm and nucleus, but only the cytoplasmic portion, formed by NPM-ALK homodimers, was kinetically active and had transforming properties. The nuclear portion, formed by NPM/NPM-ALK heterodimers, was inactive. Thus, about 50% of the NPM-ALK fusion is sequestered and inactivated in the nucleus of ALCL cells by WT NPM1. Indeed, relocalization of NPM-ALK entirely to the cytoplasm in NPM-/- cells or its overexpression in several ALK+ ALCL cell lines resulted in cell death through activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and of -H2AX, a key player of the DNA damage response pathway. Thus, excessive oncogenic ALK signaling induces a cell stress leading to apoptosis and a balanced amount of ALK activation is necessary for optimal ALCL growth. Interestingly, we selected three human NPM-ALK positive cell lines resistant to the dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113. Resistance was due to genomic NPM-ALK amplification that caused overexpression of NPM-ALK and consequently hyperactivation of downstream ALK-dependent pathways. These cell lines were not only resistant, but also drug-dependent, meaning that addition of a low amount of AP26113 was required for cellular growth and to keep normal NPM-ALK signalling levels. Indeed, upon drug withdrawal, NPM-ALK and its downstream pathways were hyperactivated. The viability of all three drug-addicted cell lines dramatically dropped, confirming that an excess of NPM-ALK signaling was detrimental for cell growth. In two resistant cell lines out of three a new population recovered in the absence of the drug and was re-sensitized to AP26113. Notably, in these new drug-sensitive populations NPM-ALK overexpression was abrogated. All together, these findings support the idea that deregulation of NPM-ALK localization might be an attractive therapeutic option. Moreover, for a subset of patients that may develop drug dependency as well as drug resistance as a consequence of NPM-ALK overexpression, a discontinuous tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapeutic schedule may be more effective than a continuous one, as it is usually proposed.']",

The most common ALK fusion in ALCL is a translocation, t(2;5)(p23;35), placing the kinase domain of ALK before the constitutively active promoter of nucleophosmin (NPM). Activated ALK drives oncogenesis by turning on multiple proliferative pathways. The success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in ALK+ lung cancer has prompted evaluation of their use in ALK+ ALCL as a therapeutic strategy for patients who fail combination chemotherapy. Clinical studies in lung cancer show resistance to these drugs limits progression-free survival. We aim to identify resistance mechanisms against approved TKIs, crizotinib and ceritinib, in ALK+ ALCL.We selected for resistance in 3 patient-derived cell lines through propagation in gradually increasing drug concentrations. We assessed resistant subclones with long-insert whole-genome sequencing, viability and proliferation assays, qPCR and western blots. Similar profiling was carried out upon drug withdrawal. We validated our findings in cytokine-dependent murine pro-B cells transformed with NPM-ALK during ceritinib incubation. We xenografted resistant clones to SCID mice and assessed tumour burden over time.Resistant clones showed viability stimulation by TKIs and when washed out of drug, these clones underwent apoptosis due to hyper-stimulation of ALK signalling. Genomic amplification of NPM-ALK was seen leading to an increased expression at the mRNA and protein levels. TKI-dependence therefore was co-selected with resistance, showing for the first time toxicity to cancer cells due to an overdose of ALK signalling. We validated our findings in IL3-dependent FL/5.12 cells, which also showed co-selection for drug resistance and dependence due to ALK over-expression. Resistant ALCL lines selected for ability to grow without TKI behaved similarly to parent lines, showing no stimulation of viability in presence of drug. ALK mRNA and protein also return to baseline in these cells. SCID mice injected with resistant cells required TKI treatment for tumour engraftment and tumour burden decreased when drug dosing was stopped. When tumours re-grew, drug treatment was reinitiated, generating a second response demonstrating in vivo that NPM-ALK up-regulation results in both resistance and dependence on the TKI and resistant cells die from an overdose of ALK signalling in the absence of drug.Our results reveal that up-regulation of the fusion-ALK drug target is a resistance mechanism, previously un-reported in any ALK+ cancers. Up-regulation of NPM-ALK provides cells means to acquire resistance but also results in ALK overdose when drug is withdrawn, revealing intermittent dosing as a potential therapeutic strategy to prolong tumour control in ALK + patients.']",

These breast implant-associated T-ALCL cases are striking for their homogeneous clinical presentation and pathology that is distinct from established classes of ALCL. In order to understand the nature of this newly emerged clinical entity, we have established three new cell lines, designated T cell Breast Lymphoma (TLBR) -1, -2, and -3, from patient primary tumor biopsy specimens. Characterization of these pre-clinical models confirmed fidelity to the original tumor biopsy specimens and highlighted unique features that may aid the development of effective treatments for these cancers. Gene expression analysis demonstrated significant up-regulation of survivin and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes (BID, BAK, BBC3) by all TLBR cell lines relative to healthy donor T cells. This preliminary finding prompted examination of upstream regulators of cell survival in T cells, namely the interleukin signaling associated with the JAK/STAT pathway. TLBR cell lines were found to secrete high levels of IL-6 and IL-10, and were strongly positive for the cognate receptors. The TLBR cell lines also showed elevated levels of STAT3 and pSTAT3 by immunoblotting techniques, along with a simultaneous reduction in expression of the pSTAT3 phosphatase, SHP-1. These results implicate an unregulated autocrine STAT3 pathway present in the TLBR cell lines that strongly contributes to their tumorigenesis. Assays of various inhibitors of this pathway support this hypothesis since targeting of STAT3 with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sunitinib, led to dramatic in vitro cell death in all TLBR cell lines. More specific inhibition of STAT3 with S3I-201 had comparable results with Sunitinib. Furthermore, IL-6 neutralization by a monoclonal antibody or SHP-1 restoration by 5-azacytidine treatment also demonstrated moderate efficacy in inhibiting TLBR cell line growth in vitro. These discoveries strongly suggest the use of these reagents in the clinical treatment of Breast Implant Associated T-ALCL. The TLBR cell lines closely resemble the primary breast implant-associated lymphomas from which they were derived, and as such provide valuable preclinical models to study the unique biology and provide clinicians with improved knowledge for treatment and diagnosis.']",

To test this hypothesis we prepared a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of wild-type NPM-ALK, as well as inactive point mutants by site-directed mutagenesis of the NPM-ALK ATP-binding site and activation loop. Results. Using NPM-ALK constructs in COS7 and 293T cells, we showed that Hsp90 strongly interacts with wild-type NPM-ALK, but fails to co-adsorb with inactive point mutants and with deletion mutants lacking the entire kinase domain. By comparison, binding to Hsp90 family members Hsc70 and Hsp70 is independent of NPM-ALK activity, suggesting a greater dependence of active NPM-ALK on Hsp90 function. Accordingly, phosphorylated NPM-ALK associated with Hsp90 and co-chaperone cdc37, and pharmacological inhibition of NPM-ALK prevented the interaction of NPM-ALK with both proteins. Of note, mutants unmasking the C-helix motif in the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain maintained the ability to bind Hsp90, whereas mutants lacking C-helix did not. Conclusions. Our findings, therefore, suggest a model in which, in addition to a role in folding nascent NPM-ALK, Hsp90 provides an ongoing folding support to activated NPM-ALK kinase, by protecting self-phosphorylated NPM-ALK from ubiquitination through recognition of specific unstable motifs within its catalytic domain.']",

BCL6 represses various downstream genes, including ATR, TP53 and CDKN1A, thereby impairing DNA repair leading to derangement of cellular proliferation. Most importantly, a specific small molecule inhibitor targeting BCL6 successfully suppressed growth of BCL6-dependent DLBCL cell lines and primary human DLBCL cells, further suggesting that BCL6 plays an important pathogenetic role. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been reported to target various oncogenic proteins, including PML-RARA in acute promyelocytic leukemia, cyclin D1 in mantle cell lymphoma, NPMc+ in acute myeloid leukemia and NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, for degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Deregulated ALK expression has been linked to the development of several types of cancers. Typically, chromosomal translocations involving ALK generate constitutively expressed chimeric oncoproteins, such as NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and EML4-ALK in non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, activating mutations in ALK, and increased copy number that result in aberrant gene expression, have also been observed in neuroblastoma and colorectal cancers. Based on the above observations, several small molecule ALK inhibitors have been developed and are in clinical trials for a variety of tumors expressing this kinase. This has resulted in the use of crizotinib for the treatment of EML4-ALK + lung cancers.Recently several large scale immunohistochemistry and genome sequencing studies of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) revealed aberrant ALK expression. It was found that ALK mRNA expression was significantly different in alveolar (ARMS) and embryonic RMS (ERMS), the two major histological subtypes in children. Thus, ALK expression might play a role in tumorigenesis for this disease, and this kinase may represent a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of RMS. To answer this question we analyzed ALK expression in a large panel of RMS cell lines, and pediatric tumor samples by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. We also compared the sensitivity of these cells to a series of ALK inhibitors. Our results indicate that the majority of ARMS cell lines demonstrated significantly higher ALK mRNA expression as compared to ERMS, and to normal human myoblast control cells. This was confirmed by western analysis. Growth inhibition assays confirmed that all RMS lines were more sensitive to crizotinib and LDK-378 than control lines, consistent with the hypothesis that ALK is a driver of cell growth in these tumors.Based on our in vitro analysis, we suggest that ALK inhibition may represent an effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of ALK+ RMS.

Although NSCs can be enriched in neurosphere floating culture with serum-free media containing EGF/FGF as a classical method, neurosphere is composed of not only NSCs but also differentiated and apoptotic cells. Therefore, we utilize the method for efficient derivation of NSCs with long-term self-renewal and differentiate capacity in adherent culture. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase first identified in a chromosomal translocation associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Subsequently, new ALK translocations were found in a fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and in other solid tumors. The function of full-length ALK is involved in neuronal cell differentiation, regeneration and synapse formation. Recently, gene amplification and mutations of full-length ALK were identified in neuroblastoma. Furthermore, it is reported that ALK and PTN, ligand of ALK, are required for maintenance of the stem cell population in GBM. Although constitutive activation of ALK signaling results in cell transformation, little is known about the tumorigenic mechanisms induced by activated ALK. We reasoned that ALK activity has a crucial role in GBM. To verify this hypothesis, human GBM stem cell lines were treated with crizotinib, ALK inhibitor. Crizotinib could suppress the proliferation of human GBM stem cell lines in dose-dependent-manner. Next, we have established a stable mouse model of brain tumor transplanting the genetically modified NSCs. Active mutant of H-RAS could transform the Ink4a/Arf KO NSCs but not WT NSCs. However, transplanting of WT NSCs transduced activated ALK could rapidly formed highly proliferative and invasive brain tumors. Histological characteristics of these tumors resembled human GBM phenotype demonstrating necrosis, perivascular cuffing and giant cell formation. Although the activated H-RAS increased expression of Ink4a in WT NSCs, but the activated ALK never changed. On the basis of these findings, we propose a specific regulation against tumor suppressor genes by activated ALK.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases. A number of recurrent leukemogenic gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and clinically validated in AML. However, nearly 50% of AML patient samples lack any known AML driver mutations. Advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of novel and actionable gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements in these AML samples. The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene is one such rearrangement identified in samples from patients with AML. Fusion of ETV6 sequences to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 results in constitutive activation of the TRKC kinase and ETV6-NTRK3 expression has emerged as one of the key oncodrivers for leukemogenesis. Constitutive activation of TRK family tyrosine kinases has also been detected in a wide range solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, highly potent and selective kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency against TRKA/B/C, ROS1 and ALK kinase activities (encoded by NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively). In these studies, we have demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib in AML cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and survival in vitro with sub-nanomolar EC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein as well as phosphorylation of known TRKC downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Sensitivity to entrectinib was dependent on expression of the TRKC fusion protein. In xenograft models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression, which was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. The clinical relevance of activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements has been validated by the efficacy of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with NTRK rearranged acute myeloid leukemias and provide rationale for the clinical development of entrectinib in molecularly defined hematologic malignancies.

In our efforts to discover pharmaceuticals with novel functionality, we introduced a neutral, stable phosphine oxide moiety as a unique hydrogen-bond acceptor in the design of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors. ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase first identified as a chromosomal rearrangement (NPM-ALK fusion gene) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and subsequently detected as an alternate fusion oncogene (EML4-ALK) in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Crizotinib, the first approved ALK inhibitor, has demonstrated impressive clinical benefit in EML4-ALK (ALK+) NSCLC patients. Drug resistance, however, emerges rapidly and point mutations within the kinase domain have been identified as a major resistance mechanism. With the specific objective to identify more potent ALK inhibitors with pan-inhibitory activity against crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants, we designed and tested a series of phosphine oxide-based compounds culminating in the identification of the clinical candidate AP26113. AP26113 exhibited 10-fold greater potency than crizotinib against ALK-positive ALCL and NSCLC cell lines, and effectively inhibited clinically relevant crizotinib-resistant mutants. AP26113 displayed 100-fold increased selectivity for ALK-positive cells over ALK-negative cell lines while maintaining selectivity over insulin receptor tyrosine kinase receptors.

Various mechanisms leading to resistance have been proposed and include ALK amplification and resistance mutations, as well as alternative pathway drivers including EGFR, cKIT and, more recently, IGF1R. We have discovered a novel and potent inhibitor of ALK, AZD3463 with a Ki value of 0.75nM which also inhibits additional receptor tyrosine kinases including insulin growth factor receptor (IGF1R) with equivalent potency. AZD3463 inhibits ALK in cells as demonstrated by its ability to decrease ALK autophosphorylation in tumor cell lines containing ALK fusions including DEL (ALCL NPM-ALK), H3122 (NSCLC EML4-ALK) and H2228 (NSCLC EML4-ALK). Inhibition of ALK is associated with perturbations in downstream signaling including ERK, AKT and STAT3 pathways leading to preferential inhibition of proliferation in the ALK fusion containing cell lines in vitro. AZD3463 also demonstrates the ability to dose dependently inhibit pALK in xenograft tumors in vivo resulting in stasis (H3122) or regression (DEL, H2228). AZD3463 retains good activity against a number of clinically relevant crizotinib resistant mutations including the gatekeeper mutant L1196M where equivalent potency to wild type ALK is observed in vitro and in vivo in EML4-ALK containing BAF3 cell lines. To further assess the potential ability of AZD3463 to overcome additional resistance mechanisms, antiproliferative activity was assessed in multiple crizotinib resistant cell lines independently derived in vitro from H3122 cells as well as a patient derived crizotinib relapsed model. These resistant cell lines contain multiple resistance mechanisms including the L1196M gatekeeper and T115Ins mutations, ALK amplification and/or secondary drivers including EGFR and IGF1R. AZD3463 retains antiproliferative potency within 4 fold of parental H3122 cells for 10 out of 12 of these acquired resistance models in vitro.

NBL tumors display a broad clinical and biological heterogeneity, ranging from highly aggressive tumors with fatal outcome to tumors with spontaneous regression. Recurrent mutations are mainly only observed in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), which is involved in the pathogenesis of both familiar and sporadic NBL. ALK encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor with importance in neuronal development and was initially characterized in anaplastic large cell lymphoma from a translocation leading to the NPM-ALK fusion protein. Subsequent studies show that additional ALK chimeras have been generated with different fusion partners in various cancers. To date no ALK-containing rearrangement has been reported in primary NBL tumors although one study has describeda NBL cell line with an ALK intragenic deletion leading to constitutive ALK kinase activity. This led us to screen for and further investigate possible ALK containing translocations in our NBL material.Genomic profiling of 350 NBL samples though SNP microarrays indicated ALK-rearrangement in four primary tumors and two cell lines (IMR32 and CLB-BAR) which were further analyzed through targeted re-sequencing of the common MYCN amplicon region (Chr2;14-18Mb) and the entire ALK gene. Briefly, detection of rearrangements was performed through solution-based enrichment followed pair-end sequencing of 400-500bp libraries.Junction sites were identified by manual sequence viewing on IGV and validated through PCR followed by Sanger sequencing.With this strategy we were able to determine translocation sites for all but one sample. In one tumor ALK was found to be translocated to GAB2 (chr11q14) causing loss of the first exon of respective gene. However,ALK and GAB2 were placed head-to-head with respect to transcription direction and this novel translocation is therefore unlikely to cause a chimeric protein. Another tumor showed translocation between ALK intron 4 and chr 4 subtelomeric region without known genes. Two NBL cell lines and one tumor had both MYCN and ALK amplification and sequencing revealed high level complexity of respective amplicon with multiple rearrangements. IMR32 show involvement of at least six different 2p-regions including MYCN and ALK exon 3-4. CLB-BAR has also multiple rearrangements including an ALK intragenic translocation causing loss of exon 4-11, ultimately resulting in an ALK protein with truncated extracellular domain.Here we show that ALK translocation sites could be deduced from targeted re-sequencing without previous knowledge about fusion partner. However, no translocations resulting in chimeric protein were detected. We were also able to detect MYCN amplicon junctions, which are highly unique for each patient and could be used for detection of minimal residual disease.']",

Crizotinib, a dual cMet/ALK kinase inhibitor, was recently approved by the FDA for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is ALK-positive, thereby validating ALK as therapeutic target. Here we describe the pharmacological characterization of a novel series of potent, selective and orally bioavailable ALK kinase inhibitors. Members of this series inhibit wild type ALK, NPM-ALK fusion and crizotinib resistant ALK[L1196M] kinase activity at sub-nanomolar concentrations, displaying up to 200 fold increased inhibitory activity over crizotinib. Kinase profiling indicate that members of this series display increased selectivity scores relative crizotinib.

Members of this series were also evaluated in the EML4-ALK expressing NSCLC cell line H3122, and displayed equipotent inhibition of pY1604 ALK activation and inhibition of cell proliferation (both IC50 = 1 nM). Members of this class did not inhibit growth of an ALK negative lymphoma cell line (HT). The in vivo activity of this series was examined in the Karpas-299 ALCL xenograft model. Compound was dosed daily (PO) at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg. Tumor growth inhibition was observed at all dose levels, and the highest dose level resulted in significant tumor regression (96%, p<0.0001) without weight loss. The inhibition of pY1604 ALK was evaluated in these tumors (8 hrs post dose); >80% pALK inhibition was observed at the lowest doses tested, and complete inhibition was seen at doses of 30 mg/kg and above. In a direct comparison, members of this series achieved ALK inhibition in these tumors at a 15 fold lower plasma concentration than crizotinib.

A single 60 mg/kg dose of an inhibitor was able to maintain >90% ALK inhibition in tumors up to 24 hours post-dose, indicating significant tumor penetration and sustained ALK kinase inhibition. In conclusion, the described compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of ALK kinase, possess an impressive efficacy profile and drug-like pharmacokinetic properties.

The Th17 differentiation requires multiple lineage defining transcription factors (i.e. ROR, RORt, and STAT3) and the activation of STAT3 signaling, which regulates a plethora of factors (i.e. RORt, IL23R), is required for the full execution of the Th17 program.

In fact, both morphology and phenotype largely overlap with those of other nodal PTCLs, including angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) and anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs).Here, we performed an extensive miRNA profiling of PTCLs in order to identify differentially expressed miRNA, either involved in their pathogenesis or potentially useful for their differential diagnosis.Methods', ' We studied by miRNA profiling (TaqMan Array MicroRNA Cards A) 60 samples including PTCLs/NOS (N=25), AITLs (N=10), ALCLs (N=12) and normal T cells (N=13); in addition, 40 independent PTCL cases were studied by qRT-PCR as validation. Further, to assess the functional impact of deregulated miRNAs, we performed a global gene expression profile (GEP) analysis in the same cases by using the Illumina Whole Genome DASL Assay. ANOVA and Student t-test were performed to find genes and miRNAs differentially expressed between PTCLs and normal T cells or among PTCL subtypes, respectively. Differentially expressed miRNAs were further filtered based on their predicted impact on the GEP using Linear Discriminant Analysis, Spearman correlation and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A discriminant function based on linear combination of GEP signatures was then used to better distinguish different PTCLs subtypes. Finally, the functional effects of selected miRNA were assessed by transfection of specific mimic and inhibitors into PTCL cells and then evaluating the GEPs (functional GEP).Findings', ' First, unsupervised analyses clearly discriminated PTCLs and normal T cells based on the miRNA expression patterns. Second, supervised analysis identified 256 miRNA differentiating the two groups (p<0.05, FC 2, Bonferroni correction). To identify those miRNA more likely to impact the GEP of the tumors, we then performed a multi-step analysis integrating miRNA and GEP data. We identified 4 highly discriminant miRNA inversely correlated with different potential target genes. All 4 miRNA were confirmed by qPCR in a validation set, while their target genes were assessed by functional GEP confirming their impact.Thereafter, we sought miRNAs differentially expressed in the PTCL subtypes, to be used as diagnostic markers. Based on ANOVA and subsequent linear discriminant analysis we identified 3 sets of miRNA able to efficiently distinguish PTCL/NOS vs. ALK-/ALCL (N=5 miRNA), ALK+/ALCL vs. ALK-/ALCL (N=4), and PTCL/NOS vs. AITL (N=8). Noteworthy, this novel molecular diagnostic tool was validated by qPCR in independent cases, demonstrating a remarkable diagnostic accuracy ranging between 85% and 95%.In conclusion, miRNA profiling allowed to identify miRNA possibly involved in PTCL pathogenesis and to develop a novel diagnostic tool for the differential diagnosis of the commonest subtypes.']",

To further test tumor-T cell interactions, malignant ascites from a patient with ALK+ ALCL and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with leukemic mantle cell lymphoma, both containing PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and tumor-associated T cells, were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (a polyclonal T cell activator) and incubated with anti-PD-L1 antibody.

        "Background":"['The clinical success of crizotinib against mutant ALK-expressing cancers has generated great interest; however, the emergence of drug resistance is limiting its durability in some patients. In NSCLC, crizotinib resistance is linked to secondary mutations within EML4-ALK at amino acids L1196M, C1156Y, L1152R. A mutation at amino acid F1174L reduced the sensitivity to criozotinib in a patient with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor harboring a RANBP2-ALK translocation. The goal of our studies was to evaluate mechanisms of crizotinib resistance in a range of ALK-mutant expressing cell lines. Cells from ALCL (Karpas299), NSCLC (NCI-H3122 and NCI-H2228) or neuroblastoma (SKNSH and KELLY) developed resistance to crizotinib after being exposed to incremental increases in the compound over several weeks. NPM-ALK expressing Karpas299 cells independently acquired point mutations in ALK at amino acids N1178H and I1171N. As the concentration of drug was increased, cells that harbored the NPM-ALK N1178H mutation also expressed a mutation at G1269A. Each mutation enhanced the temperature dependent auto-phosphorylation activity of the kinase and diminished the inhibitory effect of crizotinib on downstream ALK signaling. Mutations in Karpas299 cells were also accompanied by up regulation of a drug efflux transporter, BCRP, whose heightened expression level was dependent on the presence of the compound. In contrast no additional mutations were discovered in ALK in crizotinib resistant NCI-H3122 and NCI-H2228 (EML4-ALK) or SKNSH and KELLY (ALK F1174L) cell lines. Instead both NCI-H3122 and NCI-H2228 resistant cell lines displayed increased levels of phospho-HER2 and HER3 and activation of AKT and ERK that may be due to autocrine secretion of a growth factor. NSCLC resistant lines also displayed an apparent change in phenotype with a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. SKNSH and KELLY are inherently less sensitive to crizotinib. We found that these cells may survive exposure to high levels of the compound by altering RET expression. Our observations represent potential mechanisms of resistance demonstrated in a small number of cell lines. It will be important to align these results with emerging data from drug-resistant patients to understand the multiple mechanisms by which resistance might develop.']",

Methods', ' Retrospective, multicenter cohort study by time-dependent or non-time-dependent multivariate survival analysis with Cox proportional hazard regression. Results', ' Median age was 61 (18-81). The percentage of IPI more than 3 was 50. Median sIL-2R was 4120 ng/ml. (311-96,800).

        "Background":"[\"Aurora kinases (A and B) are oncogenic serine/threonine (S/T) kinases that play central roles in the mitotic phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Over-expression of Auroras during dysregulated cell cycling and their aberrant activation over-rides mitotic and spindle check points leading to anueploidy in many human cancers make Auroras attractive therapeutic targets. Gene expression profiling in mantle cell lymphoma [MCL] have shown the Auroras are over-expressed and is a poor prognostic marker within the proliferative signature. PTCL (NOS) are a heterogeneous group of rare non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) derived from activated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. PTCL and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) both of T-cell phenotype and ALK negative have an aggressive clinical course with an inferior event free and overall survival relative to B-cell NHL counterparts. The biological explanation for the difference is unknown. Patients with PTCL have a poor prognosis due to a very aggressive disease course coupled to a lack of effective therapies. Therefore, the development of novel and effective treatments based on biologically validated targets is urgently needed for this disease. We hypothesized and investigated that (1). Auroras are over-expressed in human PTCL-NOS, (2). Aurora ATP-site small molecule inhibitor (SMI) is effective in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in cell culture and (3). Aurora SMI will be safe and effective in treating patients with relapsed aggressive T-cell NHL in early phase clinical trials. In this study, we demonstrate that both aurora A and B are highly over-expressed in PTCL patients and cell lines. MLN8237 (alisertib), an ATP-site small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A had potent activity in inhibiting phosphorylation of Aurora A and histone H3 in PTCL cell lines. Cells treated with MLN8237 exhibited endoreduplication confirming the mechanism of action of an Aurora inhibitor. Also, treatment of PTCL cell lines with MLN8237 induced apoptosis in a dose and time dependent manner (flow cytometry and PARP-cleavage) and inhibited cell proliferation with an IC50 < 0.1M. Preliminary data from a phase II clinical trial using single-agent MLN8237 in patients with relapsed refractory aggressive NHL has demonstrated notable activity with 4 confirmed responses in 6 evaluable PTCL patients. Cytokine profiling on day 1 (pre-treatment) and day 8 (post-treatment) showed a profile consistent with aurora A activity.

We have developed methods for detecting candidate fusions using (1) mate-pair DNA sequencing (MPseq), an approach that spans the entire genome at a fraction of the cost of traditional whole-genome sequencing, and (2) RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Each technique has strengths, limitations, and false discovery rates. Here, we integrated results of both methods to discover and orthogonally validate expressed fusion genes in PTCLs.Methods', ' DNA and RNA were extracted from 49 frozen, OCT-embedded clinical PTCL specimens, including 25 anaplastic large cell lymphomas; 16 PTCLs, not otherwise specified; and 8 other PTCLs.

Detection of fusion genes and transcripts followed our published methods (Blood 2012;120', '2280 and Nucleic Acids Res 2011;39', 'e100, respectively). Functional annotation of genes involved in fusions was performed using DAVID.Results', ' Of 2818 candidate chromosomal rearrangements identified by MPseq and 90 candidate fusion transcripts identified by RNAseq, 45 events were present in both datasets (mean/case, 0.9; range, 0-7).

Annotation clusters with the highest enrichment scores related to SH2 domain-containing proteins and tyrosine kinases (including FER and MAP2K3). Seven genes were recurrently involved in fusions, including known fusion partners such as ALK and previously unreported fusion partners such as PPP1R8, a phosphatase inhibitor important for the activity of Polycomb group proteins such as EZH2. Detection of candidate events only by MPseq could be explained in part by breakpoints mapping to non-genic regions (79% of events). Detection only by RNAseq could be explained in part by unannotated transcripts spanning neighboring named genes (median intra-chromosomal distance, 0.09 MB vs. 12.7 MB for intra-chromosomal candidates identified by MPseq; p<0.0001, Wilcoxon test).Conclusions', ' Integrated DNA/RNA sequencing is an effective, clinically feasible tool for simultaneous discovery and orthogonal validation of expressed fusion genes.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) represent a heterogeneous group of generally aggressive malignancies, with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 35%. Only ALK translocations, which define ALK-positive anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL), have emerged as a genetic biomarker predicting favorable outcome following conventional chemotherapy (e.g. CHOP). Using next-generation sequencing, we discovered additional recurrent chromosomal translocations in PTCLs involving either the DUSP22 locus on 6p25.3 or TP63 on 3q28. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic utility of combined testing for both these events in PTCL patients.Methods', ' We examined the clinicopathologic features of 134 systemic PTCLs using WHO criteria, including 49 ALCLs, 23 angioimmunoblastic PTCLs, 50 PTCLs of not otherwise specified type, and 12 PTCLs of other subtypes. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine ALK expression, an established surrogate for ALK translocations in ALCL. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to detect translocations of DUSP22 or TP63 in all cases. OS was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons were made using the log-rank test.Results', ' There were 83 males and 51 females, with a mean age of 58 years (range, 6 to 90 years). Median OS for all patients was 22 months (5-year OS, 36%) with a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 0.1 to 354 months). Translocations of DUSP22, TP63, and ALK were mutually exclusive. Patients with ALK-positive ALCL (n=17) had a median OS of 176 months (median follow-up, 68 months; 5-year OS, 69%). Despite being ALK-negative, cases with translocations of DUSP22 or TP63 shared pathologic features with ALCL. Median OS was not reached in patients with DUSP22 translocations (n=7; median follow-up, 88 months; 5-year OS, 100%). Patients with tumors harboring TP63 translocations (n=9) had a median OS of 13 months (all dead at 76 months; 5-year OS, 11%). Patients with none of these abnormalities (n=101) had a median OS of 17 months (median follow-up, 13 months; 5-year OS, 29%). Differences in OS among these groups were highly significant (p=0.0002).Conclusions', ' PTCLs with DUSP22 translocations had a favorable prognosis similar to ALK-positive ALCLs. In contrast, TP63 were associated with very poor prognosis. FISH for these biomarkers is a promising tool for risk stratification, particularly since both translocations occurred in cases with overlapping pathologic features. PTCLs with DUSP22 translocations may represent a genetically defined subset of ALK-negative ALCLs. Like patients with ALK-positive ALCLs, these patients may not derive additional benefit from intensified up-front strategies such as early transplantation. Patients with none of these abnormalities comprised 75% of patients studied and had an intermediate prognosis, indicating the need for additional biomarkers in this group to improve risk stratification.']",

The median IC50s, calculated at 72h, were', ' DLBCL, 0.19M (range 0.07-12.68); ALCL, 0.48M (0.04-9.1); SMZL, 0.16M (0.1-0.24); MM, 0.45M (0.06-0.7); MCL, 2M (1.22- >15). There were apparently no IC50 differences based on the cell of origin (DLBCL) or ALK-positivity status (ALCL). Apoptosis did not appear as the main effect of the drug, being not observed in 11 cell lines treated with the IC50 defined by MTT test after 72-hour exposure. However, OTX105 determined a dose-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest in 12/12 cell lines (DLBCL, MM and ALCL), and an increased percentage of senescent cells in 3/3 sensitive cell lines (DLBCL and ALCL).MYC mRNA was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in 4/5 DLBCL, 4/4 ALCL and 2/2 MM cell lines. Down-regulation was usually seen within 1h. Real-time PCR showed that MYC and also NFKB target genes were affected. Gene expression profiling (GEP), using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip array, was done in 3 sensitive DLBCL cell lines, exposed to DMSO or OTX015 (0.5M) for 4h and 8h. MYC was the most down-regulated gene. Functional annotation of the down-regulated genes identified an over-representation of genes involved in RNA and DNA metabolism and cell cycle, putative MYC target genes and transcripts reported as down-regulated after treatment with aminopeptidase inhibitors and HDAC-inhibitors. Up-regulated transcripts were enriched of genes coding for proteins involved in chromatin structure, as well as putative MYC target genes and transcripts reported as up-regulated after treatment with HDAC-inhibitors, demethylating agents or aplidine. Also, GEP signature was similar to what reported for the BRD-inhibitor JQ1.In conclusion, OTX015 showed in vitro anti-tumoral activity in a large series of mature lymphoid neoplasms. The activity was largely cytostatic, with cell cycle G1 arrest and induction of senescence. Down-regulation of MYC and its putative targets appeared as the main effect, but it might not be the only mechanism of action, since a few cell lines did not appear to down-regulate MYC after exposure to OTX015, which also induced down-regulation of NFKB target genes and modulation of transcripts similar to what observed with HDAC-inhibitors. The compound appears worth of further investigation as a new promising therapeutic agent in lymphomas.']",
