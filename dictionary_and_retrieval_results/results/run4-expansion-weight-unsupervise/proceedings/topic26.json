        "Background":"['Background', '  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, with metastatic disease accounting for 40 to 50% of newly diagnosed patients. EGFR monoclonal antibodies (Mab), cetuximab and panitumumab, are effective treatment for KRAS wild type CRC. Although mutations in KRAS predict resistance to EGFR Mab therapy, only 80% of CRC patients with KRAS wild-type (WT) status respond to treatment. This study is a retrospective evaluation of genomic alterations in the EGFR pathway such as  alterations in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA and PTEN that may predict lack of response to EGFR Mab therapy in CRC patients.  Methods', '  A large database of 5,900 consecutive CRC patients was analyzed from 2011 onwards for demographics (sex, age, geography, site of tumor) and biomarkers that might correlate with response to EGFR Mab therapy. Comprehensive testing included gene sequencing for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, and PIK3CA (next-generation sequencing, Sanger, pyrosequencing) and immunohistochemistry for PTEN protein expression.  Results', '  Analysis revealed the incidence of KRAS mutation of 42% which is consistent with published literature. Analysis of the KRAS WT cohort revealed a mutation rate of 13.8 % for BRAF, 6.8% for NRAS, and 40% for patients with either PTEN loss of expression/mutation or a PIK3CA mutation. Earlier studies support that mutations in NRAS, BRAF and activation of the PI3K pathway by PTEN/PIK3CA analysis result in lower response rates to EGFR Mab therapy in CRC. Furthermore, multiplex biomarker testing revealed the rare occurrence of concurrent mutations', ' 1/5,900 subject harboring a BRAF and NRAS mutations, 7/5,900 others with BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, and 8/5,900 subjects with NRAS and PIK3CA mutations.  Conclusions', '  This is a comprehensive analysis of a large international cohort evaluating the prevalence of predictive molecular aberrations suspected of lack of response to EGFR Mab therapy in patients with WT KRAS. Prospective controlled studies are in progress to validate the role of BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN in clinical management of CRC. It is imperative to further explore the molecular pathology of CRC beyond KRAS in patient selection for EGFR Mab therapy.']",

As only 40% of KRAS wild-type (WT) respond it is possible that other MUT, constitutively activating the Ras/Erk or PI3K/Akt pathways, are present in the non-responding KRAS WT. We analyzed the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS & PIK3CA MUT status in 276 chemorefractory CRC treated with CTX +- irinotecan and correlated the MUT status with outcome. Methods', \" KRAS codon 12,13, 61&146, BRAF V600E, NRAS codon 12&13, PIK3CA E542K, E545K, A, G, V (exon 9), H1047Y, R, L (exon 20), N345K, R88Q and Q546K MUT were evaluated on FFPE primary CRC using the Sequenom MALDI TOF MassArray system. A two- sided Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association between PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF & NRAS MUT and objective response (OR). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results\", ' 116/276 (42%) CRC had a KRAS MUT, 96% of which occurred in codon 12 or 13. KRAS WT was associated with OR (p<.0001), longer median PFS (p<.0001) and OS (p<.0001). 15/153 (9.8%) KRAS WT had a BRAF MUT. BRAF WT was associated with OR (p=.01), longer PFS (p<.0001) and OS (p=.007). 5/98 (5%) KRAS WT had an NRAS MUT and none of these showed OR. KRAS, BRAF and NRAS MUT were mutually exclusive.

Conclusions', ' KRAS, BRAF & NRAS MUT are mutually exclusive and occur in at least 47% of CRC. Like KRAS WT, BRAF WT state of the primary is significantly associated with outcome in mCRC treated with CTX. The combined KRAS/BRAF/NRAS WT state is significantly associated with outcome.

Several studies have shown that specific mutations in KRAS and NRAS are less likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapies. Several diagnostics have been developed to identify such mutations. However, in a large number of cancer patients, tumor biopsy poses a significant health risk thereby limiting the tissue available for current molecular diagnostics. Non-invasive liquid biopsy diagnostics are revolutionizing cancer treatment selection, patient prognosis, and monitoring. Low abundance circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is purified from patient plasma and used as an alternative source of genomic material for detecting tumor mutations. Currently available qPCR kits for detecting RAS mutations have a limited sensitivity and coverage since they are not optimized for liquid biopsy purposes. Methods', ' We have developed a two-step PCR to qPCR method to identify down to single mutant copies of KRAS or NRAS in ctDNA isolated from plasma. The mutant copies are first enriched by a novel multiplexed formula of primers and wildtype (WT) allele blockers. The mutations are then identified by EntroGens RAS Mutation Screening Panel or next generation sequencing (NGS). Synthetic mutant DNA was spiked in a background of WT DNA purified from plasma to yield a range of mutant allelic burden over WT background. The dilutions were analyzed to determine the methods sensitivity. We subsequently used the method to screen 53 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient samples. Results', ' Our two-step method detects single digit mutant copies of 35 clinically significant KRAS and NRAS mutations. Furthermore, NGS experiments demonstrated the two-step method can enrich mutations more than 52-fold. KRAS 12/13 mutations were identified in 6 out of 53 (11%) NSCLC patients.

Primary and acquired resistance therefore limits the clinical benefit of EGFR blockade in CRC patients.We postulated that concomitant inhibition of multiple members of the HER (ErbB) receptors family might suppress the growth of CRC cells more effectively than selectively targeting only the EGFR with cetuximab or panitumumab.Accordingly, we assessed the pharmacological activity of momelotinib and afatinib- two pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors- in a collection of 40 CRC cell lines, which recapitulate the genetic profiles commonly detected in CRC patients. We report that primary resistance to pan-HER inhibition is associated with KRAS and BRAF mutations thus suggesting that this patients' population will unlikely benefit from momelotinib and afatinib treatments. Notably, however, pan-HER blockade was effective in a subset of KRAS/BRAF wild type CRC cell lines refractory to cetuximab and panitumumab indicating that a subgroup of patients, which do not benefit from EGFR blockade, may profit from pan-HER inhibition.To define the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to ErbB inhibitors, three KRAS/BRAF/NRAS wild type CRC cell models were continuously treated with cetuximab, momelotinib and afatinib, until resistant derivatives emerged. Genetic characterization of such derivatives unveiled that, regardless of the drug used, the resistant populations were a mixture of clones carrying distinctive mutations in KRAS or NRAS. Detailed biochemical analyses of the ErbB signalling pathway revealed that resistant variants displayed high levels of MEK and ERK activation, which persisted upon ErbBs inhibition.Collectively, these results identify KRAS, BRAF and NRAS mutations as major drivers of primary and/or acquired resistance to HERs inhibition in colorectal cancer cells and suggest that a molecularly defined subset of CRC patients might benefit from pan-HER blockade.\"]",

The likelihood of IBD-related carcinoma is greater than that of sporadic CRC. Over one half are diagnosed at stage III or IV. During the last few years we have worked on mining colon mucosal and submucosal layers for discovery of biomarkers that differentiate ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn's colitis (CC). Using LC-MS/MS, we examined signals found to be significantly different between CC and UC samples. We found a signal at m/z 5045 which was more intense in UC samples. The MALDI spectrum did not identify an intact protein entity but did identify hemoglobin chains. Macrophages are highly versatile phagocytes active in multiple roles in the immune system and key players in the inflammatory response. The microenvironment of most inflammation is filled with a large population of macrophages. In IBD, studies have found that macrophages can count for more than 50% of the exudative mass. Their presence within the inflammatory microenvironment, in some cases, has been proven to increase transformation, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. In hemorrhagic situations (as in UC) macrophages engulf erythrocytes and as a result release free heme iron (heFe). Earlier studies observed that heFe has cellular proliferation effects on colon cancer cells. Recently, the potential carcinogenic effects of heFe were documented when it was shown that heFe increases the number of aberrant crypt foci in colon mucosa. In the colon, iron is expected to increase the production of reactive oxygen (O2) species (ROS) from peroxides via the Fenton reaction, which may be the cause of cellular toxicity and even pro-mutagenic lesions. Intracellular reactions with active O2 can result in the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis by induction of gene mutations, chromosomal damage and cytotoxic effects. We hypothesize that elevated expression of mucosal free heFe would be associated with an increased risk of UC-associated CRC. To validate this will require investigating whether hemoglobin could be classified as a proliferative or transforming agent for colon cancer cells by causing reactive oxygen species release. For this purpose, we plan to study the cellular viability of differentiated colon cell line (cancer\", ' CCL 224, CCL 227 and normal', ' NCM 356 and NCM 460) after administration of hemoglobin at different concentrations.

In addition, somatic mutations in other genes such as BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, have been hypothesized to be prognostic and/or predictive in CRC. Therefore, molecular sub-classification of KRAS exon 2 wild type CRC might allow to identify subgroups of patients highly sensitive or resistant to anti-EGFR agents within the CAPRI trial. We analyzed 182 FFPE samples from mCRC patients enrolled in the CAPRI clinical trial by using a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach based on the Ion AmpliSeq technology.

These data suggest that molecular classification of KRAS exon 2 wild type CRC with the Ion Ampliseq Colon and Lung cancer panel is feasible. This approach reveals mutations in several key genes involved in CRC tumor progression.

In addition to mutational analysis, transcriptional profiling has been recently exploited to identify distinct CRC molecular subtypes, associated with biological and clinical features such as cell of origin, microsatellite instability, prognosis and response to treatments. Detailed analysis of the relationships between the subtypes and clinical/biological features requires a large panel of preclinical models closely recapitulating the molecular heterogeneity of CRC. To this aim, we assembled a large collection of 151 CRC cell lines. For each line, we', ' (i) verified genetic identity by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis; (ii) assessed microsatellite instability (MSI) status; (iii) sequenced mutational hotspots in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA genes; (iv) performed microarray-based global mRNA expression profiling; (v) evaluated sensitivity to the EGFR-targeting drug cetuximab. STR analysis revealed that some cell lines previously thought to be unrelated are indeed derived from the same individual. This result was confirmed by cell line hierarchical clustering based on mRNA expression profiles. Overall, the mutational landscape of the compendium was concordant with what observed in patients (mutation rates', ' KRAS = 47%; BRAF = 17%; NRAS = 0.7%; PIK3CA = 18%). Similarly, sensitivity to cetuximab was confined to lines without RAS or BRAF mutations. Gene expression profiling was exploited to assign cell lines to molecular subtypes, according to five different published transcriptional classifiers. We found that all molecular subtypes previously identified in CRC patients were robustly maintained in the lines. Moreover, significant overlaps were detected between individual subtypes across distinct classifiers. Subtype-specific molecular and pharmacological associations previously defined in CRC samples were largely recapitulated in the compendium. In particular, MSI+ cells were significantly enriched in inflammatory and goblet subtypes and less prevalent in the Transit Amplifying (TA) and Stem groups. Cell lines carrying BRAF mutations clustered in the inflammatory subtype, while RAS mutations were equally distributed among all subtypes. Notably, in TA lines without RAS or BRAF mutations, the fraction of cetuximab-sensitive cells was strongly enriched (56%), confirming clinical data and indicating that addiction to the EGFR pathway is an intrinsic feature of this CRC subtype. In conclusion, our results describe a powerful preclinical resource reflecting the molecular and functional heterogeneity of CRC, which can be used to explore multidimensional information of potential clinical relevance.']",

However, clinical benefit to EGFR blockade is observed in only a subgroup of CRC patients wild type for KRAS andNRAS. Genomic characterization of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of mCRC have revealed additional resistance mechanisms to the EGFR MAb cetuximab including amplification of MET, HER2 and mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 (Bertotti et al. 2011, 2015). However, not all resistance is understood and the biochemical signaling correlates of sensitivity and resistance remain incompletely understood. Phosphoproteomics allows for comprehensive protein phosphorylation profiling, and thereby may shed new insights into the biology of CRC and the molecular basis of cetuximab response.Aim', ' To identify aberrant signaling pathways, predictive biomarkers, and alternative drug targets in genomically-annotated CRC PDX models by mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics.Methods', ' We performed LC-MS/MS based phosphoproteome profiling (van der Mijn et al. 2015; Piersma et al. 2015) on untreated CRC PDX models lacking KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutation (n = 20). For comparison, KRAS, BRAF or NRAS-mutant and MET or HER2 amplified models (n = 21) were analyzed. Phosphopeptides were captured by phosphotyrosine antibodies and titanium dioxide. MS/MS data was searched using MaxQuant. Phosphoproteome data (ion intensities and spectral counts) were correlated with drug sensitivity. Dedicated bioinformatics was used to identify hyperactive kinases and signaling pathways in individual tumors.Results', ' The dataset contained 13.418 tyrosine-, serine- and threonine-phosphorylated peptides derived from 4588 proteins, including 237 phosphorylated kinases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of phosphopeptide intensities revealed subclusters enriched for sensitive and resistant models. Among cetuximab-resistant models, HER2 and MET were identified as hyperphosphorylated and hyperactive driver kinases, confirming the genomic annotation. Sensitivity to combination treatment of both EGFR and driver kinases was observed previously, providing proof-of-principle of the use of phosphoproteomics for the identification of driver kinases.Conclusion/Future', ' This project is uncovering the phosphoproteomic landscape of colorectal tumors and will yield a better understanding of signaling pathways involved, with an emphasis on identifying activated drug targets and predictive biomarkers in this disease, in relation to KRAS/NRAS/BRAF status and response to anti-EGFR therapy.']",

We correlated DUSP1, 4, 6 (isoforms a & b) & 8 mRNA expression level in FFPE primary colorectal cancer (CRC) of 186 chemorefractory patients treated with cetuximab (CTX) with KRAS MUT state and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods', ' KRAS codon 12,13, 61&146, BRAF V600E and NRAS codon 12&13 MUT were analyzed with the Sequenom MALDI TOF MassArray system. The DUSPs and 3 housekeeping genes were quantified by qRT-PCR. TwoStep cluster analysis was performed. PFS and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results', ' KRAS MUT was associated with increased DUSP4 (MWU;p=.0006) & 6a (p=.0067). DUSP6a dephosphorylates P-Erk, DUSP4 also dephosphorylates P-JNK & P-p38. DUSP1 & 8 primarily dephosphorylate P-JNK & P-p38 and were not associated with KRAS MUT.

The 32 MUT high expressors had a longer median PFS (log-rank;p=.015) and OS (p=.065) after CTX. The 17 KRAS/BRAF/NRAS WT high expressors had a shorter median OS (p=.026), but not PFS (p=.745). Conclusions', ' There is a significantly higher DUSP4 & 6a mRNA expression in the KRAS MUT compared to WT primary CRC. However, this is not a black and white observation. In the KRAS MUT there are 3 distinct clusters of DUSP4 expression. The high expressors (= supposed attenuated Erk signaling) have a longer PFS and OS after CTX. Adaptation to constitutive KRAS signaling with differential levels of MEK/Erk activation needs to be further investigated and will be of help in selecting patients for therapy with MEK inhibitors. It suggests not all KRAS MUT will be good candidates for MEK inhibitors. In the cluster of high DUSP4 expressing KRAS WT 30% are BRAF or NRAS MUT. This suggests DUSP expression of FFPE samples could be a more sensitive marker of MEK/Erk activation and resistance to EGFR inhibitors than KRAS MUT analysis alone.']",

Mutational profiling of cetuximab resistant cells recapitulated the molecular landscape observed in clinical samples and revealed three additional EGFR ectodomain alleles.Structural modelling showed that these mutations are located in the cetuximab-binding region, except for one mutant. Functionally, EGFR ectodomain mutations prevent binding to cetuximab but a subset is permissive for interaction with panitumumab.In conclusion, we reported that colorectal tumors evade EGFR blockade by constitutive activation of downstream signalling effectors and through mutations affecting receptor-antibody binding.

The study is ongoing. We used Idylla platform which allows analysis of 21 KRAS, 18 NRAS and 4 BRAF ctDNA mutations from mCRC using 2 ml of plasma. The tests were performed using prototype versions of the Idylla ctKRAS and ctNRAS-BRAF-EGFR S492R Mutation Assays (RUO), which contain all reagents for integrated sample preparation and multiplex real time PCR detection. The tests each require 1 ml of plasma, less than 1 minute hands-on time, and have a turnaround time of less than 130 minutes.As a comparator test, NGS analysis with a sensitivity of 0.2% was performed on extracted plasma ctDNA according to Pcuchet et al. (2016). Results', ' The Idylla ctDNA assays identified 84 KRAS mutated (42.4%), 6 NRAS mutated (3%) and 13 BRAF mutated (6.6%) cases.

However, lots of patients with both RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors determined by non-NGS testing might still not respond due to the presence of additional gene mutation such as PIK3CA or PTEN. Therefore, its necessary to screen mutations in genes other than RAS and BRAF on the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy. Besides, new available agents could potentially be used based on the other targetable alterations discovered. In this study, a broad, hybrid capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) assay was used to identify RAS, BRAF and additionally targetable genetic alterations from colorectal cancer tissue. Methods', ' 72 cases of colorectal cancers were enrolled and all the patients signed the informed consent before assay. 7708 exons of 508 tumor related genes and 78 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes were assessed for base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. The average median sequencing depth was 450. Results', ' 50.4% (37/72) of the tumors harbored a KRAS mutation, 4.2% (3/72) harbored a NRAS mutation and 4.2% (3/72) harbored a BRAF mutation. More specifically, 82.5% (33/40) of RAS mutation was located in exon 2. Except for RAS and RAF, 4.2% (3/72) anti-EGFR therapy response genetic mutations were found in PTEN (n = 3). Its also worth noting that actionable alterations were found in HER2 (n = 5, including 4 amplification and 1 activating mutation), FBXW7 (n = 3) and others (n = 5). Conclusions', ' Our results implied that 63.9% (46/72) metastatic colorectal cancers with genetic mutations including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PTEN might not benefit from anti-EGFR therapy. 26.4% (19/72) of samples harbored at least one actionable genetic alteration rather than RAS identified by NGS testing. Significantly, HER2 defined a unique subpopulation of 6.9% (5/72) of metastatic colorectal cancer and might be a promising driven-gene. These findings suggest that high throughput NGS testing in colorectal cancer tissue was a comprehensive and efficient genomic profiling assay to guide personalized therapy.']",

With the introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS) many more genes can be simultaneously sequenced, allowing detailed analyses of mutational patterns.We have assembled the CRC5.2 NGS panel for application with Ion Torrent PGM covering 100 frequently mutated genes with 784 amplicons (covering 21,000 COSMIC mutations), going well beyond the scope of commercially available cancer panels. In particular, exon coverage was optimized to embrace all genomic information related to drug sensitivity, using several drug and signaling network databases.The German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK) comprises the top cancer centers in Germany. As a part of this group, we employ our custom CRC5.2 panel for the analysis of mutational patterns in CRC. We address several key questions relevant for current diagnostics and treatment in colorectal cancer. In retrospective and prospective clinical studies, we assess mutational heterogeneity in primary tumors, synchronous and metachronous metastases of individual patients. In-depth NGS mutational analyses, transcriptome analysis and methylation studies will identify (epi-)genetic alterations occurring as a consequence of selective pressure during tumor evolution e.g. during metastasis, chemotherapy or targeted tumor therapy. Thus, we will uncover new links between cancer-specific mutations, clinical course and treatment response as well as novel mechanisms of secondary resistance.

Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

Its role in the progression of a colorectal adenoma to carcinoma remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CBS overexpression in a non-tumorigenic human CRC cell line (NCM356) is sufficient to increase cell proliferation, migration, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Methods', ' NCM356-p (parental) are non-tumorigenic when xenografted into athymic nude mice and express low levels of endogenous CBS, similar to normal colonic mucosa. RNASeq analysis determined mutation status. NCM-p were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing a CBS cDNA (NCM-C) or vector (NCM-v). H2S production was visualized with a fluorescent probe, 7-azido-4-methylcoumarine (AzMC). Cell proliferation rates where determined with a Coulter Counter. Cell migration and invasion assay were performed in Boyden chambers with NIH3T3 conditioned media (CM) as a chemoattractant. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed by soft-agar assay. Cellular bioenergetics was assessed using Oxygraph-O2K respirometer chamber. Tumorigenesis and metastasis were assessed injecting cells subcutaneously and orthotopically into nude mice, respectively. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) was used to inhibit CBS activity. Statistical significance (p0.05) set using ANOVA or non-parametric Student t-test. Results', ' CBS overepression and H2S production was verified by Western blot and AzMC fluorescence in the NCM-C cells. CBS overexpression demonstrated significantly increased proliferation rate (p<0.03 NCM-C vs. NCM-v or NCM-p) over 4 days in culture, invasion through matrigel (p<0.01), migration (p<0.001) toward NIH3T3 CM and increased colony formation in soft agar (p<0.01). CBS inhibition with AOAA (1mM) decreased invasion and migration (p<0.01) in the NCM-C cells compared to NCM-v. In high-resolution respirometry, respiratory rate was significantly higher in the NCM-C compared to -p and -v. (141.8  1.5 vs. 33.7  0.8 vs. 72.2  1.77  pmols1mg1, -p v -C p < 0.0001, -v v -C p < 0.0005, -p v -v p < 0.001).

Although the NCM-C cells produced significantly larger tumors in mice compared with NCM-v or NCM-p (p<0.001 2-w ANOVA), none of the cell lines caused liver metastasis in vivo.

Our aim was to investigate the prognostic value of EpHA2 and subsequently correlate expression levels to known clinico-pathological variables in early stage CRC. Methods', '  Tissue samples from 509 CRC patients were analysed. EpHA2 expression was measured using IHC. Kaplan-Meier graphs were used.

Results', '  EpHA2 was highly expressed in CRC adenocarcinoma compared to matched normal colon tissue. In support of our preclinical invasive models, strong correlation was found between EpHA2 expression and CD44 and Lgr5 staining (p<0.001).

When stage II/III was broken down into individual stages, there was significant correlation between high EpHA2 expression and poor 5-years OS in stage II patients (HR', ' 2.18; 95%CI', ' 1.28-3.71; p=0.005).HR in the stage III group showed a trend to statistical significance (HR', ' 1.48; 95%CI=0.87-2.51; p=0.05). In both univariate and multivariate analyses of stage II patients, high EpHA2 expression was the only significant factor and was retained in the final multivariate model. Higher levels of EpHA2 were noted in our RAS and BRAF mutant CRC cells, and silencing EpHA2 resulted in significant decreases in migration/invasion in parental and invasive CRC sublines.

        "Background":"['Although histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are considered a promising novel therapeutic approach in the light of their potent tumour-selective effects, the use of these inhibitors for treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) have thus far demonstrated limited success as a monotherapy. What this eventually boils down to is our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms, the impact of oncogenes, and thus the key pathways through which HDACi affect tumour cell growth. To shed further light on this, the involvement of oncogenic RAS - a key driver of CRC, in determining the responsiveness to HDACi has been explored. By using cell line model systems harbouring conditional oncogenic NRAS, KRAS and HRAS, we uncovered an oncogenic RAS-dependent “safeguard” mechanism imposed in order to evade the cytotoxic effect of HDACi and therefore apoptosis. Characteristically, cells harbouring oncogenic RAS were observed to undergo a reversible senescence-like growth arrest in G2, allowing for re-entry into cell cycle following the withdrawal of HDACi. This mechanism is implemented as a consequence of the direct targeting of RAS by HDAC inhibition, which resulted in a further amplified GTP-binding activity and subsequent signalling through the MAPK pathway. The observed outcome was an increase in the priming of MYC for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, thereby enabling the cells to exit the cell cycle and enter the protective state of G2 arrest. This process was functionally reversed with a conditional non-degradable MYC (T58A/S62A), which in turn rendered the cells more susceptible to undergo apoptosis. Conclusively, in the context of a constitutively activating RAS mutation, the prospect of HDACi treatment was effectively improved using current MAPK-targeted therapy by preventing the observed pro-oncogenic effect of the HDACi treatment alone.']",

        "Background":"[\"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer in the United States. Although chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies can improve survival rates, recent studies have shown the potential benefit of immunotherapies to improve outcomes for patients with advanced CRC. Targeted therapies that use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to EGFR have been shown to benefit some CRC patients. Until recently, KRAS has been the only predictive biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy for metastatic CRC. However, 40% to 60% of patients with wild-type KRAS do not respond to anti-EGFR therapy. Therefore, to accurately predict patients response to treatments and improve clinical outcomes, additional prediction and treatment methods are imperative. One of the many efforts to improve prediction for CRC patient's response to the anti-EGFR therapy is the development of gene expression based RAS signature scores for identification of RAS activated tumors independent of mutations in the KRAS gene. Recently there have been major advances in immunotherapeutic approaches in a wide variety of cancers. In solid tumors such as melanoma and colon cancers, immune checkpoints have been shown to improve clinical outcomes. There is considerable effort being placed on combinations of targeted therapy and immunotherapies to improve responses for these cancers. Similarly, since no single treatment can apply to all CRC patients, we aim to stratify patients using a combination of three methods\", ' 1. RAS signature score based on the expression profile of 18 genes. This RAS signature score enables measurements of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) pathway functional output independent of tumor genotype. 2. Expression profile of immune checkpoint inhibitor target genes, such as PD1 and PDL1, and 3. In-silico prediction of neo-antigens and peptide binding affinity between tumor antigens derived from mutations and human HLA alleles.55 FFPE samples were selected from a cohort of 468 samples with matching FF samples. These 55 samples have about 1', '1', '1 ratio of high, medium and low RAS scores. Here we showed our ability to obtain RAS signature scores with concordant results using different platforms including RNA-seq, targeted RNA-seq, Nanostring and Affymetrix microarray. Samples that have RAS activating mutations such as KRAS and BRAF have significant higher RAS scores (p<0.001). Interestingly, expression of PD-L1 was significantly lower in tumor samples harboring mutations of genes such as MET, PTEN, NRAS, FBXW7, and GNAS. Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the expression of PD-L1 was significantly lower in samples with higher RAS signature scores (p<0.05). Combined with further prediction of tumor antigen derived from genes with missense mutations, we provide a combinatorial method for stratifying metastatic CRC patients.']",

One of challenging issues is to predict response to targeted therapies. Here we report identification of PTPRS, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a regulator/biomarker of ERK activation and inhibitor response in colorectal cancer. To identify the genes with high frequency mutations that might be predictive of RAS pathway dependence (“addiction”), we used a gene expression signature score to stratify 468 colorectal cancer tumors that also underwent targeted exome sequencing for 1321 cancer-associated genes. We found that, when the masking effects caused by mutant KRAS, BRAF and NRAS was iteratively removed, mutant PTPRS was strongly correlated with RAS pathway activation, with a mutation rate of 10.4% (22 out of 211 remaining tumors). This led us to inactivate PTPRS in vitro using a specific peptide inhibitor, siRNA or CRISPR approaches in various colorectal cancer cell lines. Inhibition/loss of PTPRS significantly elevated phosphorylation of ERK and AKT and substantially sensitized cancer cells to the treatment of ERK inhibitors, which was enhanced by an AKT inhibitor. Surprisingly, PTPRS did not modulate the activity of EGFR and the ERK kinase, MEK. Our data indicate that PTPRS negatively regulates ERK signaling downstream of the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK pathway in a mechanism independent of AKT and DUSP6. As a result, inactivation/loss of PTPRS promotes ERK activation and “addiction”, thereby contributing to increased sensitivity to ERK inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Mutations in the B-raf oncogene constitutively activate the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. The most common BRAF mutation (V600E) occurs in approximately 70% of primary melanomas and 10% of colorectal cancers. Melanoma patients carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation respond with frequency of 80% to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, while colon cancer patients respond at a rate of 5% only, indicative of intrinsic resistance. Moreover, clinical benefit is further limited by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance among vemurafenib responders. Combination therapy targeting both BRAF(V600E) and possible escape pathways appears to be a promising approach to reverse resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular characterization and in vitro chemosensitivity profiles of 20 melanoma and 20 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Four of the colon and 11 of the melanoma cell lines were established at Oncotest from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Molecular profiles include the mutation status of BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS (exon sequencing) and protein levels for components of the MAPK, EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways (Western blot analysis). Sensitivity profiles for inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, EGFR and PI3K were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based survival and proliferation assay. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors was investigated by combination of vemurafenib with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or inhibitors of potential escape pathways like EGFR, PI3K/AKT or c-MET and evaluated by combination index according to Chou-Talalay.In line with the clinical situation, the BRAF V600E substitution was found in 13/20 (65%) of the melanoma and only in 4/20 (20%) of the colon cancer cell lines. BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in melanoma cell lines and KRAS mutations did not occur at all. Among the colon cancer cell lines, in addition to the BRAF(v600E) mutation, alteration in KRAS (10/20 cell lines), PIK3CA (6/20) and NRAS (1/20) were detected. Chemosensitivity profiling revealed intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors for 3/13 (23%) BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and for 3/4 (75%) BRAF(V600E) colon cancer cell lines. Reversal of the resistance of BRAF inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cell lines was recorded as synergism between vemurafenib and inhibitors of vasious kinases (c-MET, AKT, PI3K, MEK, or EGFR. A particularly strong synergistic interaction was found for vemurafenib and the c-MET inhibitor SU11274, irrespective of BRAF status. For colon cancer cell lines, the strongest synergisms were detected for the combinations of vemurafenib with inhibitors of c-MET, EGFR, PI3K, AKT and MEK.Displaying similar mutation and chemosensitivity profiles as melanomas and colon cancers in the clinic, the present cell line panels represent valuable tools to investigate the reversal of resistance towards BRAF inhibitors.']",

Outside tissue was obtained with a median of 6 calendar days (8% had insufficient tumor).  IHC, sequencing, and CIMP results required a median of 11, 12, and 20 days, respectively.  In this population, 53% tumors had KRAS mutations, with BRAF, NRAS, and PI3KCA mutations, and complete PTEN loss present in 8.1%, 8.6%, 21%, and 12%, respectively.

        "Background":"['Background', ' The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a key driver of tumor growth in colorectal cancer (CRC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although EGFR inhibitors prolong overall survival in many patients, resistance inevitably develops. Resistance usually arises through alterations in the EGFR pathway itself or through upregulation of alternative signaling pathways. In CRC in particular, mutations in KRAS and NRAS are strong predictors of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Such resistance may potentially be overcome by combining MM-151, a potent EGFR inhibitor, with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor. In KRAS/NRAS wild-type tumors, resistance may arise through activation of parallel signaling pathways. Emerging data suggest that heregulin (HRG)-driven signaling through ErbB3 and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-driven signaling through IGF-1R may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors by activating pro-survival signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. If HRG-mediated signaling is active, resistance may potentially be overcome through the combined administration of MM-151 and the ErbB3-targeting antibody MM-121. Similarly, if IGF-1-mediated signaling is active, resistance may be overcome by combining MM-151 with the IGF-1R-targeting antibody MM-141. The rationale underlying this trial is that mechanisms of resistance may be identified through biomarker analyses, allowing patients to be prospectively assigned to an appropriate investigational regimen. Methods', ' This is a Phase 1, biomarker-directed open-label study evaluating the safety, pharmacology and preliminary activity of MM-151 in combination with trametinib, MM-121, or MM-141. Patients are evaluated for KRAS/NRAS status and tumoral expression of HRG and IGF-1 and are then assigned to the study arm matching their biomarker profile. A modified 3 + 3 design is used to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose. Expansion cohorts in CRC and SCCHN will then be opened to further evaluate safety and preliminary signs of efficacy.

The transfer of this knowledge and technology from top clinical labs to local hospitals is still distant. With the goal of a robust, precise, simple and cost-effective genomic test, we designed a prospective study featuring high-sensitive mutation screening of ctDNA from RAS-wild mCRC with digital PCR (dPCR) technology. This approach allows detection of 85 hotspot mutations of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA, which are present in approximately 60% of CRC, and is clinically important information for anti-EGFR treatment. Methods', ' 18 RAS-wildtype mCRC patients, initially diagnosed with PCR-rSSO (RASKET) using CRC FFPE samples, were recruited. After extracting ctDNA from patient plasma, dPCR analysis was conducted with LBx Probes. Results', ' Mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA, were detected in 5 samples (KRAS in 3 samples, NRAS in 1 sample, BRAF in 1 sample, and PIK3CA in 2 samples).

Interestingly, we also encountered another patient who had never received anti-EGFR antibodies, but who tested RAS mutation-positive at a level below the detection sensitivity of PCR-rSSO. Conclusions', ' Our dPCR screening with ctDNA was able to identify mutations successfully in a previously-diagnosed RAS-wild mCRC group. Based on these results, we designed the following test, which with <0.1% mutation sensitivity, would be useful for 1) predicting the efficacy of anti-EGFR antibodies prior to treatment; 2) predicting early emergence of acquired resistance to EGFR blockade; and 3) monitoring disease progression during treatment.

Herein, we compare profiles of LCC from younger ( 45 years) and older pts ( 65 years). Methods', ' LCCs (splenic flexure to rectum; n = 1,602) were examined by NextGen sequencing, protein expression, gene amplification, and microsatellite instability fragment analyses. Tumor mutational load (TML) was calculated using only somatic nonsynonymous missense mutations. Chi-square tests were used for comparisons. Results', ' LCCs from younger (median age 40, range 22-45 years, n = 229) and older (median age 71, range 65-89, n = 503) pts were studied.

High TML ( 17 mutations per megabase) was seen more frequently in younger pts (8.2% v. 2.6%, P = 0.02). Conclusions', ' The molecular differences between LCC in younger and older pts are mostly due to mutations in mismatch repair genes.

Tumors from cecum to transverse colon were defined as RCC, and tumors from descending colon to rectsigmoid were defined as LCC. Results', ' RCC was 66 patients and LCC was 92 patients. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or mutinous adenocarcinoma were significantly more frequent in RCC compared to LCC (P = 0.047). KRAS mutations were detected in 35 patients with RCC (53.0%) and in 32 patients with LCC (34.8%). NRAS mutations were detected in 2 patients with RCC (3.0%) and in 3 patients with LCC (3.3%). There was no HRAS mutation in all patients. BRAF mutations were detected in 7 patient with RCC (10.6%) and in 2 patients with LCC (2.2%). PIK3CA mutations were detected in 8 patients with RCC (12.1%) and in 10 patients with LCC (10.9%). KRAS and BRAF mutation in RCC were significantly more frequent than in LCC (P = 0.022 and P = 0.024, respectively). These mutations were not significantly different according to tumor stage. In this study, both KRAS and BRAFmutations were exclusive. Conclusions', 'KRAS and BRAF mutation were more frequent in the patients with RCC compared to those with LCC in all stages.

Methods', '    We retrospectively reviewed, in a single center, all cases with mCRC with known RAS mutational status based on next generation sequencing (ONCO44 and ONCO48). These assays identify clinically relevant mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS. Additional eligibility criteria included the availability of CEA levels and imaging studies at first diagnosis of mCRC. Patient demographics, primary tumor location and sites of metastatic disease at 1st diagnosis were captured. CEA levels were stratified as normal or elevated based on a cut point of 5ng/ml.   Results', '    139 mCRC patients satisfied the eligibility criteria (75 RAS-MT, 59 RAS/BRAF-WT, and 5 BRAF-MT). BRAF-MT patients were excluded from the analysis due to their small sample size. Patients with RAS/BRAF-WT tumors were more likely to present with metastatic disease to the liver, but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.056). There was no difference in the incidence of normal CEA at presentation in RAS-MT (30%) and RAS/BRAF-WT (28%) cohorts. CEA production was dependent on the pattern of metastatic disease. Elevated CEA was associated with the presence of liver metastases versus no metastases among RAS-MT (92% vs 47% p <.0001) and RAS/BRAF-WT patients (82% vs 50% p = 0.0101). RAS status did not impact the likelihood of CEA production within the hepatic metastases and non-hepatic metastases groups.   Conclusions', ' RAS status does not appear to influence CEA production in patients with mCRC. CEA elevations are highly associated with liver metastases and are less prevalent in patients without hepatic involvement.

Here, we report our experience with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that enables the detection as well as molecular characterization of CRC with rare and potentially targetable receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) alterations.  Methods', '  We use a hybrid capture-based NGS assay encompassing all exons of 341 cancer genes (MSK-IMPACT) to sequence tumor against matched normal to detect potentially actionable somatic alterations including point and indel mutations, copy number alterations, and selected structural rearrangements.

Mean TML was 12, 11, and 8 mutations/megabase for RT, LT, and RC, respectively (RT vs RC; p = 0.01). There was a correlation between TML and PD-L1 (p = 0.04) and PD-1 (p = 0.01). Conclusions', ' Tumors arising in the right colon carry genetic alterations that are different from LT as well as RC.

        "Background":"['CRCs arise through genetic changes that impact various driver genes and in some tumors increased mutation rate in microsatellite unstable tumors. The hypermutable phenotype associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) results from loss of the mismatch repair system (MMR) activity. MSI is detected in 15% of all CRCs, and such tumors have a better prognosis and different chemotherapeutic outcome patterns, including high clinical benefit from immune checkpoint therapy or relative resistance to 5-FU as compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays an essential role in carcinogenesis of CRCs and is known to be overexpressed in MSI CRCs while highly mutated in Lung cancer. We analyzed the mutation frequency of deregulated pathways including EGFR and its downstream genes KRAS and BRAF in CRCs. We found a significantly elevated EGFR mutation frequency in CRC MSI-H subtype (45.5% vs. 6.5% in MSS CRCs, p<0.0000001). Although KRAS and NRAS are mutated with high frequency in both MSI-H and MSS groups, BRAF corresponding to RTK-RAS pathways is more altered in MSI-H than MSS CRCs (32.67% vs 13.10%; p=0.001), consistent with the known association between MSI-H CRCs and BRAF mutations. We hypothesized that there might be a mutation pattern in EGFR in CRC subtypes that provide a rationale for EGFR-targeted therapy for a subtype of CRC. Of 1104 profiled CRCs in the COSMIC v73 database, somatic EGFR mutations were mapped for 101 MSI-High versus 916 MSS CRCs. EGFR mutations mapped on the protein structure revealed that mutations are mainly targeting tyrosine kinase (TK) domain while the extracellular domain remained mostly wild-type with potential for targeting by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. It is known that downstream genes such as KRAS as well as expression levels of EGFR ligands can affect the sensitivity of CRCs to anti-EGFR therapy. We didn’t detect any difference in mRNA expression level between MSI-H and MSS group but our analysis is indicative of the presence of G12D mutations in a high proportion of KRAS-mutated MSS CRCs, therefore resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab would be expected. However, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib could be considered for further testing in patients with MSI-H tumors that have a lower frequency of G12D KRAS mutations and may have mutant EGFR.']",

Activation of the MAPK pathway due to mutations in BRAF, NRAS and KRAS is considered one of the causes of solid tumors (NSCLC, CRC,HCC, andthyroid cancers) and hematologic malignancies.HM95573 is a novel, highly potent RAF kinase inhibitor. Biochemically assayed for over 120 kinases, HM95573 showed the high selectivity toward BRAF mutant and CRAF kinases. The half maximal inhibition concentrations (IC50) of HM95573 against BRAFWT, BRAFV600E and CRAF kinases were 41nM, 7nM and 2nM, respectively. The strongly inhibited kinases subsequent to RAF kinases appeared to be CSF1R (44nM), DDR1 (77nM) and DDR2 (182 nM).HM95573 potently inhibited the growth of BRAFmutation CRC cell lines (e.g. IC50', ' 118nM for Colo-205) and thyroid cancer cell lines (43nM for B-CPAP); KRAS mutation NSCLC cell lines(297nM for Calu-6),CRC cell lines(65nM for HCT-116) and thyroid cancer cell lines(479nM for CAL-62); and NRAS mutation HCC cell lines(28nM for HepG2) andleukemia cell lines (39nM for HL-60). HM95573 effectively inhibited the phosphorylations of MEK and ERK, downstream kinases associated with cell proliferation in tumor cell lines mutated in BRAF, KRAS and NRAS.

Moreover, in metastatic patients, tumor molecular heterogeneity obscures accurate RAS status and surveying of multiple tissue sites is impractical. To overcome these challenges, a standardized BEAMing platform to perform RAS mutation analysis from circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was developed for patient testing in the clinical laboratory and its performance was evaluated. Methods', ' ctDNA from 205 mCRC patients recruited at centers in the US and Europe was tested with the OncoBEAM RAS CRC kit that detects 34 separate mutations in KRAS/NRAS codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, 146. Concordance was determined by comparing plasma RAS mutation results to those from time matched tumor samples using the local standard of care (SOC) method. Comprised of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent disease, this cohort is representative of the anti-EGFR therapy intended use population. Discrepancies in RAS results between matched plasma and tumor samples were evaluated with tissue BEAMing. Results', ' Plasma ctDNA testing with the OncoBEAM RAS CRC kit showed a high degree of concordance with 189 of 205 (92.2%) cases having equivalent RAS mutation status as that determined from tumor tissue, 104 of 115 (90.4%) showing positive percent agreement, and 85 of 90 cases showing negative percent agreement (94.4%).

        "Background":"['Introduction There are numerous causes triggering CRC. 25-80% of CRC shown a deregulation in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) pathway. Two signaling pathways downstream of the EGFR are dysregulated in CRC the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF (MAPK pathway) and PIK3CA affect prognosis and/or response to anti-EGFR MoAb. PTEN is a downstream effector of EGFR pathway and is involved in PI3K pathway. Loss of PTEN protein expression can occur through epigenetic silencing and mutation or allelic loss. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the most effective way to assay for loss of PTEN expression. IHC lack of reproducibility and this has lead to discordant results regarding the concordant in paired CRC metastases and primary tumors.The aim of the work was to asses the feasibility of PTEN gene expression analysis from FFPE tissue in CRC samples.Materials and methods We selected a series of 33 patients, already tested for KRAS mutational status and resulted wild-type. At the time of the study mutational status of NRAS gene has not a role as predictive marker, so was not performed. A retrospective analysis on CRC FFPE tissue was performed. As control samples we have selected specimen of colorectal surgery not tumor-associated (diverticulitis). On these samples BRAF mutational analysis and PTEN gene expression was performed. For BRAF analysis, DNA was extracted by means of QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit (Qiagen, USA). BRAF mutational status was assed through direct automated sequencing (3100 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan mutation detection assay (ABI PRIM 7900HT, Applied Biosystems). For PTEN gene expression, total RNA was obtained through the miRNeasy FFPE tissue kit (Qiagen, USA), according to manufacturer instructions, and reverse transcribed. PTEN expression was assessed by means of TaqMan probes.Results According to BRAF mutational status we have found 10/33 (30%) mutated samples. PTEN expression levels were evaluated by the comparison of tumor samples vs diverticula samples, the data obtained were then integrated with those from BRAF mutational analysis. Interestingly we found that all the BRAF mutated samples present also a down-regulation of PTEN. Statistical analyses were conducted through the X2 test with the Yatesha correction (p=0.00023). The p-value was also calculated Exact Fisher Test (p= 0.00021) to confirm the results.Conclusion The determination of PTEN gene expression level is feasible with real-time PCR using TaqMan probe technology. BRAF analysis might be used as prognostic and/or predictive marker in CRC patients treatment. The identification of a validated method for PTEN analysis would establish it as a molecular marker meriting further investigation in large numbers of available primary tumors from patients with CRC. Further analyses are requested to confirm these data.']",

In order to investigate this role, we prospectively enrolled 250 patients with stage II and stage III colorectal cancer (NCT01198743). Plasma samples were collected before surgery (D0) and 5 days later (D5), then every 4 months during the 3 years of follow-up. The end of follow-up will be May 2017. The primary tumors were characterized for KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, APC and TP53 mutation by sequencing. The circulating DNA was assessed by picoliter digital droplet PCR (dPCR) using the Raindrop instrument (Raindance technologies) with Taqman probes for the 7 most frequent mutations of KRAS and for the BRAF V600E mutation. The survival without recurrence curves were estimated with the Kaplan- Meier method. Differences between groups of patients were analyzed using unstratified log-rank tests. For comparisons of baseline characteristics, categorical outcomes were analyzed with 2 tests and continuous outcomes were compared with standard parametric or nonparametric tests. Continuous variables are presented as the mean (SD) and median interquartile rang. We present here the results of tumor circulating DNA for the first 56 patients with KRAS or a BRAF mutated tumors. The mean age was 65.311 years [37-84], the gender ratio M/F was 0.9. The tumor location was proximal or distal in 55% and 45% respectively. TNM classification showed 49% and 51% of stage II and stage III respectively. The tumors were found mutated for BRAF in 9 cases (16%) and mutated for KRAS in 47 cases (84%). Finally 54% of the patients received an adjuvant chemotherapy. Tumor circulating DNA was found in 12 patients out of the 56 tested patients (23%). A mutation identical to that found in the tumor was identified at D0 or D5 after surgery before any chemotherapy treatment in the plasma of 12 patients (21.4%). For the patients with circulating tumor DNA, the mutated allele frequency in the plasma range from 0.2 to 1.4% (median 2.4). The detection of circulating tumor DNA was more frequent in patients with recurrence or death from the disease during the follow-up than those without at the time of diagnosis (45.4% versus 15.6%, p = 0.03). Patients without circulating tumor DNA before or 5 days after surgery have a significant better survival without recurrence than those with circulating tumor DNA detectable in univariate analysis (HR', ' 7.3 CI95% [1.7-31.5] p = 0.006). After adjustment on tumor stage this result remains significant (HR', ' 6.9 CI95% [1.5-32.9] p = 0.01) During the follow-up DNA was detected in 36.7% of patients who recurred or died from the disease as compared to 2.2% of those who do not (P = 0.004). These preliminary results showed a strong prognostic impact of circulating tumor DNA at the time of surgery and need to be confirmed in the whole series of 250 patients and with the complete follow-up of 5 years.']",

This phase 1 trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of HM95573 in patients with solid tumors. Interim results from the phase 1 study are presented here. Methods', ' Patients who had solid tumor with BRAF, KRAS or NRAS mutation were enrolled. HM95573 was administered everyday with 21-day cycle and treatment cycle has been repeated until disease progression or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Dose escalation was performed with PK-guided dose escalation method until target AUC achieved or the first DLT observed. Safety assessments include adverse events (AE), laboratory test, ophthalmologic and dermatological assessments, physical examination, vital signs, and ECG. Serial blood samples were collected on Cycle1Day1, Cycle2Day1, and Cycle3Day1 for PK analysis. Tumor responses were assessed every 6 weeks. Results', ' Total 31 patients were enrolled in 5 cohorts and doses of each cohort were 50mg QD, 100mg QD, 200mg QD, 200mg BID and 300mg BID. Mean terminal half-life of HM95573 was within the range of 50 to 80 hours after single dosing. However, dose regimen was changed from QD to BID to maximize drug exposure with current formulation. Tumor types from 31 patients were colorectal cancer (68%), melanoma (23%), lung cancer (3%), GIST (3%) and bladder cancer (3%); the BRAF (45%), KRAS (45%) or NRAS (10%) mutation. One patient at 200mg BID experienced grade 3 skin rash as a DLT and up to 300 BID, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. HM95573 was well tolerated up to 300mg BID; Most of AEs were generally Grade 1 or 2 and most frequent drug-related AE was rash (17%). One patient with NRAS mutant melanoma (200mg QD) experienced an unconfirmed partial response at 12 weeks, and 9 patients had stable disease. Conclusions', ' Overall, HM95573 was well tolerated up to 300 BID as exposure increased. Preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity has been observed from 200mg QD, however, current phase 1 study will explore higher doses to evaluate the therapeutic potential of HM95573 further.

Two of these patients had maintained response for over 1 year and one patient is still on study after 30 cycles. Of the gynaecological cancers, 3/5 patients (60%) achieved a partial response (KRAS-mutant endometrial and ovarian cancer and BRAF-mutant ovarian). Of these patients, 1 of the KRAS mutants had received 2 previous lines of MEK inhibitors and the BRAF mutant had previously received a BRAF inhibitor. In the miscellaneous group, 4 patients with colorectal cancer (2 BRAF and 2 NRAS) and 1 patient with NRAS-mutant melanoma were treated and none responded. Two patients with MM have been treated so far (1 KRAS, 1 KRAS+NRAS).

        "Background":"['REDX05358 has been identified as a novel, highly selective and potent next generation pan RAF inhibitor with improved therapeutic potential and predicted safety profile. Aberrant signalling via the MAPK pathway is commonly seen in cancer. RAF inhibitors such as Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib have been approved for the treatment of unresectable and metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma, but these agents lack efficacy in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), partly because of EGFR-mediated feedback reactivation of the MAPK pathway via CRAF. Furthermore, RAF inhibitor treatment of RAS-mutant, BRAF wildtype melanomas has been associated with other skin cancers, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma due to MAPK pathway paradoxical activation mediated by CRAF. There is therefore a clinical need for novel agents targeting the MAPK pathway that do not have these undesirable properties. Here we present, REDX05358 that demonstrates subnanomolar binding affinity for BRAF and CRAF with high selectivity profile against a panel of 468 kinases that exhibits negligible paradoxical activation due to inhibition of both RAF monomers and dimers. As a result, REDX05358 not only inhibits MAPK signalling in BRAF V600E mutant tumor cells, but also in those harbouring NRAS and KRAS mutations. Furthermore, REDX05358 does not induce feedback reactivation of the pathway through its ability to sustain inhibition of MAPK signalling in CRC cell lines. Correspondingly, profiling of REDX05358 in a panel of CRC, melanoma and NSCLC cell lines shows it has potent anti-proliferative activity in cell lines harbouring BRAF or RAS mutations. REDX05358 is an orally bioavailable, well tolerated small molecule that has demonstrated in vivo efficacy in BRAF V600E CRC xenograft model. In contrast, first generation inhibitors such as Vemarafenib and Dabrafanib have been reported to be ineffective in this genetic background in CRC cell lines and patients. Thus, we have developed a pan RAF inhibitor with unique pharmacological properties enabling it to have utility in treating BRAF and RAS mutant cancers']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' EGFR is a clinically validated target for advanced colorectal carcinoma, but EGFR targeted therapies are useless against EGFR expressing tumors with K/NRAS mutations. We hypothesized that an anti-EGFR antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that used EGFR to target the tumor and deliver a cytotoxic payload rather than blocking EGFR pathways may be useful for K/NRAS mutant EGFR expressing cancers. To this end, an anti-EGFR ADC was designed using a meditope-directed site-specific conjugation strategy. This strategy uses proprietary peptides that bind an antibody Fab fragment noncovalently in a unique site outside the paratope. This novel binding is exploited for site-specific covalent conjugation of cytotoxic payloads to any meditope-enabled antibody. The meditope peptide can be designed with a photoactivatable side chain, allowing the peptide-antibody interaction to be covalent. Herein, we report the development of an anti-EGFR ADC, utilizing a technology which we call SnAP (site-specific novel antibody platform) which may be effective against KRAS/NRAS mutant forms of colorectal carcinoma. Methods', ' An ADC was designed and tested for cytotoxicity in wild type and KRAS mutant cancer cell lines. Highly efficient site-directed covalent attachment of a toxin to the antibody was facilitated by a novel photoactivatable meditope peptide. Non-GLP safety studies were performed, and conjugation stability was assessed. Efficacy studies were performed in KRAS wildtype as well as KRAS mutant EGFR expressing xenografts. Results', ' A stable ADC with precisely controlled drug-antibody ratio (DAR) and unaltered affinity for EGFR was created using a novel photoactivation strategy. The meditope-directed ADC showed selective cytotoxic activity in EGFR+ cell lines, irrespective of KRAS mutation status. The potency of the ADC against EGFR dependent tumors was demonstrated in an EGFR expressing colon carcinoma xenograft study. Conclusions', ' Meditope-directed photoactivation is a novel way to generate site-directed ADCs. Anti-EGFR ADCs created in this fashion may permit patients with KRAS mutated EGFR expressing tumors to receive EGFR targeted therapies.']",

CfDNA allows a non-invasive assessment of the present molecular features of the tumor, but the degree of information provided and the clinical utility of the testing remains to be defined.Methods', ' Patients were prospectively consented for collection of cfDNA from plasma samples for sequencing on a 54-gene platform optimized for very low allele frequencies (Guardant360), a CLIA certified lab, and concurrent sequencing of clinically available and FFPE tissue following institutional standard of care (Ion-Torrent panel). Results were returned to patients and physicians within 12-19days, and used for evaluating clinical trial options. Surveys of treating physicians were provided to assess clinical utility of the additional ctDNA testing.Results', ' 105 patients were enrolled after a median of two prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease. Plasma testing was successful in all patients, and tissue sequencing was only able to be performed in 90% of patients, due to limited tissue availability. In the plasma testing, 85% of samples had a detectable genomic alterations (including 21% with detectable amplifications in EGFR, MET, or ERBB2), with an average of 4.6 mutations detected per patient. In the cases with tissue sequencing results, 38% of the cases had mutations detected in the plasma that were not present in the historic tissue. Only 8% of these were the previously described acquired mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and EGFR with anti-EGFR monoclonal inhibition. Mutation in TP53 and SMAD4 genes were the most common newly detected in plasma. In many cases, it appeared that these represented minor clones not represented in the sequenced FFPE tumor. In support of this, the median allele quantification for these newly detected mutations was only 4% (IQR = 1.7% to 31%) of the dominant clone, in contrast to concordant mutations that were present at 87% (IQR = 54% to 100%) of the allele burden of the dominant clone (P<0.0001).Physicians felt that the plasma testing improved the quality of provided care in 87% of the cases, and improved patient satisfaction in 97% of the cases. Plasma testing results were available before the tissue testing results 89% of the time. Actionable alterations, as determined by the physician, were identified in 37% of patients, including 17% rate of actionable amplification. Of these, 56% of the patients had enrolled or were planning to enroll on a clinical trial based on the results. Conclusions', 'Comprehensive analysis of the plasma from patients with metastatic colorectal cancer demonstrates a high rate of new molecular information, including identification of in potentially actionable mutations. This approach appears to improve physician perception of quality of care obviating the need for repeat invasive biopsy for genomic testing.']",

Mutations in NRAS and KRAS may affect up to 50% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent data suggest the clinical benefit of panitumumab is restricted to patients who have no tumor mutations in RAS, defined as codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117 and 146 of KRAS and NRAS genes. An Extended RAS panel* targets these codons as a single multiplex assay. A dual strand approach distinguishes true mutations from artifacts commonly found in DNA from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue. Analytical performance of this panel was characterized.Methods', ' FFPE tissue was examined for tumor content and area. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue, cell lines and plasmids. The DNA quality and quantity were simultaneously determined through a quantitative PCR measurement of amplifiability. TruSeq Custom Amplicon technology targeting each strand of DNA was used to construct NGS libraries. Sequencing was performed on the MiSeqDx, and the Illumina Somatic Variant Caller was used to call somatic variants.Results', ' The dual-strand amplicon approach results in high accuracy by eliminating false positives observed on one strand of DNA typical of an FFPE artifact, by requiring every variant to be detected on both strands. We evaluated performance on 500 FFPE CRC samples processed with the Extended RAS panel. Concordance against Qiagen TheraScreen and Sanger Sequencing results was evaluated. The somatic variant caller yields a specificity of 0.98 and sensitivity of 0.72 for variants in the 5%-10% range, and a specificity of 0.96 and sensitivity of 0.98, overall, where we take the alternate methods as truth. Cumulative FFPE tissue area influences performance of the RAS panel. FFPE of a range of tissue area were tested using 1, 3, 5, and 8 sections per sample. 80mm2 minimum (240mm2 recommended) cumulative tissue area using 5uM slices was optimal for performance and accuracy. DNA quantity and quality also influence test accuracy and sensitivity. A study with 40 FFPE specimens assayed over multiple operators and sequencers produced average coverage of 32,000 reads per target per sample, and over 93% alignable reads per sample. Reproducibility of mutations detected over multiple operators and instruments was 100%. The Extended RAS Panel demonstrates robust performance across many sources of variation, including FFPE DNA extraction method, DNA storage time, recommended DNA input range, qPCR/PCR thermocyclers with little to no impact on sample pass rate and agreement with Sanger sequencing. We also demonstrate detection of 56 distinct mutations in a single run.Conclusion', ' This multiplex assay achieves high accuracy for detection of somatic mutations from DNA extracted from FFPE colorectal tissue samples.*In development For Research Use Only.

Microsatellite instability (MSI), determined by IHC (MLH1, MSH2, MLH6 and PMS2) and fragment analysis, was similar between cohorts (10.3% vs. 8.1%), but somatic MSI high (determined by concurrent BRAF mutation) was higher in older pts (6% vs. 0%, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in TS (37% vs. 34%), ERCC1 (25% vs. 26%) or TOPO1 (49% vs. 46%) expression between age groups.  Older pts showed a trend toward higher PD-L1 expression (2.9% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.0512) but there was no difference in the frequency of PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (39% vs. 43%).    Outcome was evaluable for 82 pts (younger, 47; older, 35). Most pts received FOLFOX + Bev as first line Rx.  Median OS was worse in younger pts (p = 0.03). Low ERCC1 expression was associated with prolonged survival in older (p < 0.01) but not in younger (p = 0.3) pts.  There was no association between TOPO1 expression and OS (p = 0.8).

Vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib (GSK2118436), selective BRAF inhibitors, and trametinib (GSK1120212), an allosteric MEK inhibitor, have shown robust clinical efficacy in melanoma patients 7-10. However, the majority of responses are transient and cellular resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation involving the downstream extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (reviewed in 11). We hypothesized that pathway blockade at ERK, the last signaling node prior to MAPK transcriptional programming, would not only be efficacious in MAPK-activated tumors but would also have utility in BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistant settings. We therefore sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of ERK. This report describes the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a potent and selective ATP competitive inhibitor of ERK1/2 which displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency on tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistant models as well as in the context of BRAF/MEK combination resistance. Together these data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors, not only in patients with MAPK activated tumors, but also in patients who have developed acquired resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors or resistance to the recently described combination of these agents.']",

Mutations in KRAS exon 2, other KRAS or NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA were detected in 34.0%, 8.0%, 4.6%, and 8.6%, respectively. MSI status was evaluable in 805 pts, of which MSI-H was detected in 15 pts (1.9%). These MSI-H were also detected without normal tissue in this study. Among MSI-H pts, 6 were associated with BRAF V600E mutation, 3 with KRAS exon 2 mutation, and 2 with PIK3CA mutation (overlapping with KRAS exon2). BRAF+MSI-H was associated with older age at presentation and worse OS than non-BRAF+MSI-H (median age, 71.5 vs. 47yrs; median OS, 6.9 vs. 18.1 months).We also found rare germline variants in microsatellite of NR21 and BAT25, and these allele frequencies were 0.33% and 0.25%, respectively. Conclusions', ' The frequency of MSI-H advanced CRC was 1.9% in Japan. BRAF+MSI-H was associated with worse prognosis. MSI test and multi-oncogenes mutation analysis were feasible without normal tissue, although rare variant of microsatellite markers may affect the decision of MSI status.']",

We report findings from 210 consecutive malignancies submitted to Genomics and Pathology Services at Washington University in St. Louis (GPS@WUSTL). DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor selected by histopathologic review. Up to 1 g of DNA (minimum, 0.2 g) was used for library preparation using liquid-phase cRNA capture probes targeting all exons of BRAF, CTNNB1, CHIC2, CSF1R, DNMT3A, EGFR, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KIT, KRAS, MAPK1, MAP2K2, MET, NPM1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, PTPN11, RET, RUNX1, TP53, and WT1 (302 kb). Libraries were sequenced by Illumina technology to obtain 101bp or 150bp paired-end reads. Mean coverage was 1596; 50x depth was achieved at >95% of positions. The analysis pipeline was validated for variant allele frequency >10%. Variants were called and interpreted using the Clinical Genomicist Workstation. A list of clinically actionable variants (hot spots) was curated by literature review. Of 210 cases, 94 (45%) were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 20 (9.5%) were pancreatic cancer (PCA), and 17 (8.1%) were colorectal cancer (CRC), the balance representing 38 diverse other malignancies. FFPE tissue cores yielded a median of 2.4 g DNA (interquartile range 1.0-4.9 g). Sequencing identified a mean of 5.4 non-synonymous coding and/or splice site variants per case (single-nucleotide variants and indels). Of these, a mean of 2.8/case were not known polymorphisms and likely represented somatic mutations. Somatic variants most commonly occurred in TP53 (233 variants in 107 cases), KRAS (52 variants in 51 cases), and EGFR (40 variants in 33 cases). Sequencing identified 74 clinically actionable (i.e., predictive or prognostic) mutations in 61/210 = 29% of cases. In NSCLC, actionable mutations were present in KRAS codon 12 (29/94 cases), EGFR exons 19 (5 cases), 20 (1 case) and 21 (5 cases), and the PIK3CA helical domain (4 cases). In PCA, there were no variants currently recognized as actionable, but one potentially targetable MET T1010I variant was found. In CRC, actionable mutations were present in KRAS codon 12 or 13 (6/17 cases), PIK3CA (3 cases) and KIT (1 case). Average turnaround time was 29 days. In conclusion, NGS-based diagnostics can provide clinically relevant information using readily available FFPE tissue. Actionable variants were identified in 29% of cases. The existence of targeted therapies suggests that such diagnostics have the potential to improve patient outcomes.']",

Methods', ' A cohort of 24 lung and 25 colon cancer patients was constituted in the Hospices Civils of Lyon.

Also termed liquid biopsy the approach is applicable for pre-diction of response and prediction of resistance to biological therapy (1, 2). Various techniques have been used for ctDNA detection, frequently employing clonal amplification on a digital PCR format (3) with limits of detection (LOD) below 0.01% of mutant alleles. However, these techniques suffer from high complexity, expensive instrumentation, and a considerable cost per sample. We hereby present a simple low-cost alternative that is implementable to routine ctDNA testing.Methods', ' A panel of PCR amplicons (106 - 174bp) was resolved by denaturing capillary electrophoresis (DCE) revealing minute presence of mutation specific hetero-duplexes. The final panel consisted of clinically relevant oncogenic mutations KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR as well as cancer-related mutations in tumor suppressors TP53, APC and CTNNB1. A total of 299 patients was subsequently examined for presence of ctDNA in plasma including 194 with colorectal cancer (CRC), 26 with NSCLC and 79 with pancreatic cancer (PanC). CtDNA status was correlated to TNM stage and tumor markers (CEA and Ca19-9). In a subset of CRC patients (n = 20) the ctDNA was monitored in 2 - 6 month intervals and correlated to the therapy response.Results', ' The experimental LOD value was in the range between 0.03 - 1% for all tested mutations within the panel. A minimum input amount of DNA was 5 pg (0,005 ng).. The overall rate of ctDNA detection was 32% for CRC (stages I - IV), 31% for NSCLC (stages III - IV) and 27% for PanC (stages II - IV). The highest detection rate, 69%, was observed in Stage IV CRC patients. Comparison with tumor markers (TM) revealed 62% of cases positive for both TM and ctDNA and 13% TM-negative cases with ctDNA positivity. Post-operative absence or persistence of ctDNA was related to the radicality of the surgical treatment and the ctDNA levels were concordant with the response to adjuvant chemotherapy. In several patients a disease progression was signalized based on ctDNA even prior to actual clinical detection by CT imaging.Conclusion', ' DCE is a simple technique applicable for detection of ctDNA in cancer patients without a need for costly hardware/software equipment. The detection rates are 10 - 15% lower compared to the dedicated dPCR techniques, however, the method requires ca 100x less input DNA, the cost per patient is about 10-fold lower and the turnaround time per test is under 5 hours.Supported by the Czech Ministry of Health Grant 14383.Literature1.

Of the 257, 21 are control amplicons to allow for gene deletions/amplifications. The average length of the amplicons is 198 bp ranging from 124 bp to 255 bp.Validation - From a pool of 120 routine tumour samples characterised with a 50 gene mutation panel (Ion Torrent PGM2) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing and/or COBAS (Roche) QPCR, 24 FFPE cases were selected representing colorectal cancer and 4 other solid tumour types; all included a variety of DNA quality, and DNA concentration was standardized prior to library preparation. Pre-analytical handling was in accordance with established protocols in a laboratory, clinically-accredited in the UK for tissue-based, anatomical pathology testing.ResultsThe evaluation of this MEK/MET-specific panel (Illumina MiSeq platform) resulted in 100% coverage of all targets, a higher than 97% on target reads and higher than 99% of all amplicons within 20% of mean coverage. The design minimized the areas of low coverage. A small part of exon 9 of ERBB2 was covered suboptimally', ' the low covered region is 30 bp in size located at the 5 end of exon 9. It is unlikely that this low coverage led to false negative results since no mutations are reported in the COSMIC database for this DNA fragment. The results were concordant in relation to mutations involved in the genes stated above. Importantly, the percentages of allele frequency between both methods were similar, with variations ranging from 0.2% to 11.5% with an average variation of 5.2%. Insertion/deletion (Indel) detection however, required alternative bioinformatics pathways.ConclusionAfter combining well-established quality metrics to cover pre-analytical aspects with suitable technologies such as the MiSeq platform (Illumina) and appropriate bioinformatics, we recognize that this MEK/MET-specific NGS panel is fit for purpose.']",

        "Background":"['The development of minimally-invasive methods to detect and monitor tumors continues to be a major challenge in oncology. We used digital PCR-based technologies to evaluate the ability of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect tumors in 640 patients with various cancer types. We initially use targeted, exomic, or whole genome sequencing to identify sequence or structural alterations in tumor tissues of 410 patients using targeted, exomic, or whole genome sequencing. We found that at least one tumor-specific mutant molecule could be identified in <5 mL of plasma in >75% of patients with advanced ovarian, colorectal, bladder, gastroesophoageal, pancreatic, breast, melanoma, hepatocellular and head and neck cancers, but in less than 50% of primary brain, renal, prostate, or thyroid cancers. In patients with localized tumors, ctDNA was detected in 73%, 57%, 48% and 50% of patients with colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast adenocarcinoma, respectively. Circulating tumor DNA was often present in patients without detectable circulating tumor cells, suggesting that these two biomarkers are distinct entities. In a separate panel of 206 patients with metastatic colorectal cancers, we showed that the sensitivity of ctDNA for detection of clinically relevant KRAS gene mutations was 87.2% while and its specificity was 99.2%. Finally, we assessed whether ctDNA could provide clues into the mechanisms underlying resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blockade in 24 patients who objectively responded to therapy but who subsequently relapsed. Twenty-three (96%) of these patients developed one or more mutations in genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Remarkably, nearly half (45%) of the observed mutations observed were in codon 61 of either the KRAS or NRAS gene. Taken together, these data suggest that ctDNA is a broadly applicable, sensitive, specific and robust biomarker that can be used for a variety of clinical and research purposes in patients with several multiple different types of cancer.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['A major hurdle for targeted cancer therapies is the development of resistance, with many agents showing promising initial results but not providing significant overall survival benefits. To address resistance we need to know the genetic and epigenetic alterations that drive resistance. This knowledge will contribute to modified treatment protocols, new targets, and predictive biomarkers. We are working on a system to model evolution of tumor resistance in a the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse system. Compared to xenografts, PDXs are closer to the tumor biology of the patient, having a higher degree of molecular subtypes and intratumor heterogeneity, and a mixture of human and mouse stroma. In this study, we implanted 1-3mm chunks from a primary colorectal cancer tumor carrying the BRAF V600>E mutation into immunosuppressed NOD/SCID CB.17 mice. Once the tumors were established (100-150mm3 tumor burden), the mice were stratified into two groups, control and fed chow containing the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, 417 mg/kg (Scientific Diets). The tumors in most of the PDXs in the group fed PLX4720 chow regressed and became very small by day 77. In several cases PDXs that were allowed to develop beyond day 77 became resistant to PLX4720 treatment.To identify mechanisms of PLX4720 resistance we sequenced DNA and RNA from two resistant PDXs, one untreated control PDX, and a sample of the original patient tumor. We used the Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel from Life Technologies to sequence exons from 409 cancer related genes on the Ion Torrent PGM. Additionally, we performed SOLiD 5500 paired-end (50x25 nt) next generation sequencing (NGS) of the whole transcriptome of these samples. Since the stromal component of the PDXs is a mixture of cells of human and mouse origin, and sequence reads of mouse origin could contribute to false positive mutation calls or skew expression analysis of the resistant data, we needed to develop a method for filtering mouse reads out of our sequencing data. To this end, we have developed and applied a read filtering protocol that sorts reads that align to the human genome into three groups, better in human, better in mouse, or ambiguous. 97.7% of the reads from human tissue were defined as better in human with the remaining 2.3% being ambiguous, or better in mouse. PDX derived reads had between 8% and 13% of reads being better in mouse. Only reads defined as better in human were used for expression analysis and SNP calling in this work. In one of the two resistant tumors analyzed this method has identified a candidate resistance mutation, NRAS G13>D. The NRAS mutation is seen in both the RNA-seq and DNA-seq data, and is not seen in the original patient tumor, the control untreated PDX, or in the second resistant tumor. Based on these findings, we feel that PDX provide a powerful model system for examining the evolution of resistance to targeted agents.']",

        "Background":"['Mutated BRAF oncogene, which fuels unregulated MAPK pathway in most melanomas, can be targeted by a small-molecule drug vemurafenib. However, most of patients develop an acquired resistance during treatment or have an intrinsic resistance to this drug. Nonreceptor SRC tyrosine kinase is deregulated in most cancer cell types and can be efficiently inhibited by a small-molecule inhibitor dasatinib, an anticancer drug which is already used for the treatment of some cancers and is in final clinical trials for other tumor types. Although SRC does not have its own canonical pathway, it is capable of activating and augmenting different signaling routes in cancer cells. We found that melanoma tumor cell lines analysed up to date are generally resistant to dasatinib. The exception to this rule was Hbl, a very sensitive cell line whose cells were completely killed by a 10 nM of dasatinib in a few days. The difference in resistance of melanoma cell lines to dasatinib did not depend on primary versus metastatic cell origin or the presence of BRAF or NRAS mutations. Instead, the dasatinib sensitivity was dependent on its ability to inhibit completely both the MAPK and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. This inhibition was at least as prominent as the inhibition by specific inhibitors of the two pathways. SRC has been reported previously to have links to this signaling pathways with the capacity to inhibit them in some cell types. Moreover, extensive cross-talk exists between the two pathways. Similar results were observed in several other cell lines derived mostly from lung and colorectal cancers. Our data indicate that the singular therapy of melanoma by dasatinib only would bring no benefit to patients, except for the cases (probably rare) where dasatinib strongly blocks both MAPK and AKT signaling pathways in tumor cells. More molecular knowledge about the effects of the powerful anticancer drug dasatinib is required in order to be used for the treatment of melanoma. This work was supported by grant IGA no.

In 1634 colorectal cancers, 47% had one abnormality, 30% two and 3% three. Commonest abnormalities were mutated TP53 (25%), double mutated TP53 and kRAS ( 17%),  kRAS only (17%) and BRAF (5%).  In 535 melanomas there were 42% BRAF mutants, 22% NRAS mutant and only 2.4% with double abnormalities.

Differences in right (R) versus left (L) sided mCRC may be due to differences in consensus molecular subtyping. Clinically predictive mutations in ras, (kras, nras and braf) may also help drive some of the differences in outcome. However, patients with mCRC who undergo surgical resection of CRLM often have a good prognosis. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of tumour sidedness on OS after resection of CRLM. Methods', ' Patients who underwent resection of CRLM in the province of Alberta, Canada were identified from 2004-2016. Tumour sidedness was determined by chart review, with R from the cecum to transverse and L from splenic flexure to sigmoid. Where available, ras mutational status was collected. OS was measured from the time of CRLM resection to death or last follow-up using the Kaplan-meier method. R and L were compared using the log-rank test and a Cox regression model. Results', ' 471 patients were identified who underwent resection of CRLM for mCRC, including 204 R and 267 L. Median age was 65, 63% male, with 54% synchronous metastatic disease, and 67% with a Charleson comorbidity index of 0. All ras wildtype was present in 22% of cases, any ras mutation was detected in 21% and 57% were unknown at the time of analysis. The median OS of R was 45 months, compared to 72 months for L, log-rank p = 0.01. After adjusting for potential confounders with a Cox-proportional hazard model, R compared to L remained significant, with a HR of 1.4 (95% CI 1.0-1.9, p = 0.02). ras mutational status was also significant for ras mutant, HR 2.4 (95% CI 1.7-3.3) and ras unknown HR 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1) compared to ras wildtype p < 0.01. Conclusions', ' Primary tumour sidedness continues to have an impact on OS in mCRC, even when disease is managed surgically with resection of CRLM. Though limited by numbers, the impact remained significant even after controlling for potential confounders, including ras mutational status. Additional ras testing is underway.

The primary endpoint was OS; secondary end points included PFS, ORR, safety and translational research. Results', ' Of 121 randomly assigned pts, 117 pts were eligible for analysis. OS was almost similar between two arms (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.77) with median OS of 16.2 months in Pmab and 13.4 months in Bmab (Stratified Log-rank P=0.499). Median PFS was 6.0 months in Pmab and 5.9 months in Bmab (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.66). ORR was 46.2% in Pmab and 5.7% in Bmab. KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutations in circulating tumor DNA were identified in 19 (17.4%) of 109 pts whose baseline plasma samples were available for biomarker analysis. For pts with any of these mutations, Pmab showed worse OS than Bmab (HR, 0.42) meanwhile better trend was observed in Pmab for all WT (HR, 1.21; P for interaction =0.026). Pmab showed better OS than Bmab in patients with low serum VEGF-A ( median) level, (HR 1.92) while Bmab showed better OS among those with high level (HR 0.67; P for interaction=0.016, table).

Liquid biopsy studies to-date have been limited to modest-sized cohorts and case studies. Here we present genomic profiling results from liquid biopsies of >10,000 advanced cancer patients in whom Guardant360TM (G360) was ordered for clinical care.G360 provides deep-coverage (15,000x average) and highly accurate sequencing of ctDNA across a 70-gene target-capture panel. It detects single nucleotide variants, indels, gene amplifications, and fusions across all NCCN-recommended solid tumor genomic alterations with analytic specificity >99.9999% and analytic sensitivity <0.1% mutant allele frequency. Consecutive commercial test results (6/2014-11/2015) were analyzed for yield and patterns of genomic alterations by tumor type. ctDNA mutation patterns and frequencies were compared to published tumor tissue sequencing results (TCGA, ICGC).Of the >10,000 patients (>50 solid cancer types), 80% of patients had at least one somatic alteration detected in ctDNA (median = 3; mean = 4.3 alterations). The most common cancers were lung (32%), gastrointestinal (23%), and breast (14%). Mutational spectra across the 70 analyzed genes were similar to TCGA results with the notable exception of increased prevalence of resistance mutations in the liquid biopsy cohort, likely owing to ongoing/prior therapy. Canonical drivers in NSCLC patients were generally mutually exclusive, although activating EGFR or RAS mutations were observed in 12.5% of patients with fusions (5/40). Colorectal cancers showed both mutual exclusivity among KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF drivers, and convergent evolution toward downstream pathway activation under anti-EGFR therapy, with some samples showing multiple resistance mechanisms. Mutation patterns for the most frequently mutated genes were generally well correlated between ctDNA and published tissue data, including for commonly altered tumor suppressor genes (for TP53', ' Pearson r = 0.94, Spearman  = 0.80).G360 is ordered prior to initial treatment when biopsy tissue is exhausted, unobtainable or under-genotyped, but more often is ordered upon progression to identify evolving resistance mechanisms that may be targetable. Thus, relative frequencies of genomic alterations were expected to differ from published frequencies established in unselected, early-stage, treatment-nave cohorts. Nonetheless, the specific patterns of alterations in ctDNA from this unprecedented liquid biopsy cohort largely recapitulated patterns observed in published tissue sequencing studies. Moreover, ctDNA sequencing clearly and robustly identified convergent evolution of drug resistance occurring under therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Lung cancer has traditionally been treated according to histologic subtype with a plateau in the efficacy of combination chemotherapy.  Recent advances have identified oncogenic driver mutations in lung cancer that predict response to targeted therapies. However, knowledge resources are limited regarding the clinical relevance of such mutations.   Methods', '  We performed a literature review regarding the prevalence and clinical significance of various treatments for ~40 mutations in 10 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, AKT1, HER2, PTEN, and ALK) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data from prospective and retrospective trials as well as preclinical studies was collected.   Results', '  ~100 articles/abstracts were synthesized into the publicly available My Cancer Genome website (mycancergenome.org) which launched in Jan 2011. Content includes information about the oncogene pathway (e.g. What is EGFR-), the clinical significance of the gene for a specific type of cancer (e.g. EGFR in NSCLC), and a summary of clinically relevant data related to a particular gene mutation (e.g. EGFR Exon 19 deletion in NSCLC).  Information regarding mutation directed clinical trials open for accrual both at Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center and worldwide is provided using a direct query of clinicaltrials.gov. This decision support tool is integrated into Vanderbilts electronic medical record to provide actionable decision support for mutation directed treatment prioritization and clinical trial availability. Clinicians, patients, and researchers with access to the internet can also access the website freely and directly.   Conclusions', '  My Cancer Genome is an international resource to assist clinicians in prioritizing genome directed cancer therapies.  The first implementation includes content for NSCLC.  We are now expanding the content to include melanoma, breast cancer, colon cancer and other malignancies. New data will be incorporated on an ongoing basis.  We welcome public/private partnerships to expand content and make this a truly global resource.']",

        "Background":"['BackgroundCancer therapy is challenged by diverse molecular implementations of oncogenic processes and by variations in therapeutic responses. So far, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES) has been implemented in both research and clinical settings to identify oncogenic events in cancer genomes. However, a large number of passenger mutations have been identified and true driver mutations have been disguised. Distinguishing driver events from passenger events will be a key challenge for the realization of targeted therapy. To elucidate driver mutations that are clinically actionable, the Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy at MD Anderson cancer center has developed a NGS clinical sequencing platform, T200, to sequence 202 cancer-related genes at high depth in thousands of cancer patients at MD Anderson.Materials and MethodsThe T200 mutation data, including single nucleotide variants (SNV, variant allele frequency >=1%) and copy number variations (CNV), of more than 500 cancer patients treated in MD Anderson Cancer Center were utilized in our study.Results1. By analyzing the SNV data, we identified several sets of co-occurring genes across all cancers. Some sets such as KRAS/APC/SMAD4 contain driver genes from multiple signaling pathways, which may indicate essential mechanisms for tumor development and nominate targets for combinational therapy.2. We elucidated mutual-exclusive mutations that were from genes in the same or different pathways. Several sets of well-known mutual-exclusive SNVs were verified in our analysis such as BRAF/NRAS SNVs in melanoma. We also illustrated novel sets of mutual-exclusive mutational events, such as IDH1/PTEN/PPP1R3A SNVs in brain tumors and EGFR/FGFR3/GNAS/NOTCH4 CNVs in all cancers.3. SNVs of more than 10 genes were enriched in specific cancer types, such as IDH1 and NF1 in brain tumor, BRAF and MITF in melanoma. CNVs of more than 50 genes were found enriched in one cancer type, such as PDGFRA amplifications in brain tumors and IL6R amplifications in breast cancer. We observed not only expected cancer specific mutations such as BRAF SNVs but also novel mutations such as NF1 SNVs and PDGFRA amplifications.4. We performed mutual-exclusivity and cancer type enrichment analysis on SNV hotspots. More than 20 SNV hotspots were elucidated, such as BRAF(V600E) in melanoma, IDH1(R132H) in brain tumors, KRAS(G12D) in colorectal cancer, and PIK3CA(H1047L) in breast cancer. In addition, multiple SNV hotspots were found to occur mutual-exclusively, such as BRAF(V600E)/IDH1(R132H)/MPL(L532V) in brain tumors.ConclusionDeep target sequencing enables us to systematically determine the potential driver mutation events (including low allele frequency SNVs), which not only help us characterize the landscape of cancer genomic alterations, but also provide comprehensive patient molecular profile to facilitate clinical decision-making and novel clinical trial design.']",

        "Background":"['Clinical validation of circulating DNA analysis as liquid biopsy for the detection of point mutations and of the longitudinal metastatic colorectal patient follow up for detecting emergence of resistance to targeted therapyWe carried out two clinical studies in metastatic colorectal cancer patients (i) the clinical real-time evaluation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis for detecting point mutations in comparison with tumor tissue analysis before initiation of anti-EGFR therapy and (ii), the study of the emergence of associated resistance mutation in refractory patients under treatment.(i) We realized a real-time blinded prospective multicentric clinical study on 140 patients comparing KRAS (exon 2,3 and 4) and BRAF V600E mutations determination by plasma and tissue analysis carried out in the conditions of standard management care. On 121 patients where both analysis were made, 43% were found mutant by tumor tissue analysis while 57% were found KRAS mutant by ctDNA analysis. 7.2% of patients were found BRAF mutant by tumor tissue while 14.4% were determined mutant by ctDNA analysis. 13% of plasma samples carried multiple KRAS point mutations and 4% of plasma samples exhibited at least one KRAS point mutation combined to the presence of BRAFV600E point mutation. Median data turnaround time was 16 [3-273] days for tumor tissue while it was 2 [0.5-10] days for ctDNA analysis. CtDNA analysis appears much more sensitive than tissue analysis and may be more accurate in respect to the intra-tumor or inter-tumor heterogeneity and the clonal evolution dynamics. We present the first RAS and BRAF mutation distribution which takes into account the presence of multiple mutations in the same mCRC patient.(ii) In the other blinded clinical study, we retrospectively analyzed RAS (KRAS and NRAS) and BRAF mutations in serial plasma samples from 42 refractory mCRC patients to Folfox + cetuximab or dasatinib. 98% of the plasma were found mutant before or during treatment. 50% of KRAS mutant samples were missed by tumor tissue analysis before treatment. 4.8% of patients were found BRAF mutant by tumor tissue analysis while 7% were found mutant by ctDNA analysis. Longitudinal plasma analysis shows that 80% of initially WT patients acquire at least one RAS or BRAF mutation during treatment and that 38% of initially mutant patients acquire at least one newly KRAS or BRAF point mutation during treatment. CtDNA analysis allows tracking acquired resistance by studying the real-time clonal evolution of the tumorPatients may harbor mutations at very low frequency on ctDNA down to 0.01% before initiation or during treatment revealing the need of a high sensitive technique to detect mutant subclones. Our results indicate that plasma analysis could advantageously replace tumor tissue analysis and enables longitudinal examination of tumor molecular profiling.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' AE-mABs (cetuximab and/or panitumumab) have been approved for the treatment of RAS wild-type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (pts). Indeed, previous studies have identified mutations (MTs)/amplifications in RAS/RAF/MEK kinase pathway as the main genetic events promoting primary and acquired resistance to these mABs. RAS status is frequently established on archival material, as tumour re-biopsy may not be always feasible. PROSPECT-C is a prospective trial aiming to define novel and known mechanisms of resistance to AE-mABs by obtaining repeated biopsies and sequential bloods from pts receiving AE-mABs for chemo-refractory mCRC.Here we present the preliminary results of the PROSPECT-C liquid biopsy study where the goals were to', ' 1) confirm the ability of ctDNA to determine RAS status prior to treatment; 2) determine any discordance of RAS status between archival material and ctDNA; 3) confirm the ability of ctDNA to track emerging MTs in the RAS pathway.Materials and Methods', ' Plasma was collected at baseline (BL), every 4 weeks and at progression (PD). ctDNA was isolated using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by digital droplet PCR (QX200 Bio-Rad) for MTs in KRAS-G12D, KRAS-G13D, KRAS-G12V, KRAS-Q61HA>T, KRAS-Q61HA>C, and BRAF-V600E. In the next steps, plasma samples with no MTs in the first series of hotspots will be tested for the remaining KRAS hotspots, NRAS, EGFR, PIK3CA MTs and KRAS, c-MET and HER-2 amplifications (Data to be presented).Results', ' Twenty-four pts (all treated with AE-mAB monotherapy) with KRAS WT tumors (from archival tissue) have been treated on this ongoing study; 16/24 had ctDNA analysis (mean age 62 years, 62.5% males) so far. All pts were heavily pre-treated; 58.3%, 31.3% and 12.5% received 2, 3 and 4 lines of prior therapies respectively. Of 15 pts with BL samples, 5 had MTs at BL; 2 with KRAS-G12D, 1 with KRAS Q61HA>T and 2 pts with BRAF-V600E (in the latter case concordance was found with the archival material). Best response was found to be PD in 4/5 pts and stable disease in 1/5pt with BL MTs; 2 with BRAF MTs progressed in <2 months (mo). The median progression free survival (PFS) for pts with BL MTs was 1.8 mo. Five pts with no MT at BL developed one or more MTs later; those included 4 with KRAS-G12D, 3 with KRAS-G13D and 2 with KRASQ61HA>T (median PFS = 4.8 mo). 3/15 (20%) pts showed discordance in RAS MTs between archival material (WT) and baseline bloods (MT); all of them progressed within 3 mo.Conclusions', ' Liquid biopsies can be a useful tool in determining and tracking RAS MTs in pts undergoing anti-EGFR therapy for mCRC. ctDNA analysis to assess RAS mutational status prior to receiving AE-mABs in our series showed 20% discordance between the archival solid and BL liquid biopsies, which may account for resistance to these therapies.']",

However, validation in real-life cohorts and its association with clinical and molecular markers is lacking. Methods', ' In Sep 2013 we started a platform trial in 49 German cancer centers recruiting patients with UICC stage II and III CC diagnosed between 2008 to 2016. MSI was tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. In case of any loss of protein expression (IHC neg), fragment length analysis (FLA) was performed, defining MSI high tumors (MSI-H) and MS stable tumors (MSS). Besides, mutations in known prognostic factors for CC such as RAS, BRAF, PI3K and others were determined by next generation sequencing (NGS).
