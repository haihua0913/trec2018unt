        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and incidences are rising. MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in playing a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of thyroid cancer, as evidenced by the high incidence of non-overlapping mutations of the genes encoding RET and TRK, as well as of NRAS, HRAS, KRAS and BRAF. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is commonly associated with mutations of the RAS family of oncoproteins, while papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is often associated with mutations in BRAF. To determine whether mode of MAPK activation played a role in thyroid cancer development in mice, we generated HrasG12V and BrafV600E knock-in models. We report that a thyroid specific knock-in of HrasG12V and Pten inactivation leads to the development of FTCs and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTCs) by 47-52 weeks of age in HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre mice. In stark contrast, mice with a thyroid specific knock-in of BrafV600E and loss of Pten (BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre) rapidly develop PDTCs and anaplastic thyroid cancer with complete lethality by weaning, suggesting that Braf and Hras, in cooperation with PI3K signaling, likely play distinct roles in the development and progression of disease. We next sought to dissect the role of Hras versus Braf activation in FTC versus PTC development. We derived stable cell lines from HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre and BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre tumors in order to identify cellular and molecular consequences of Hras versus Braf activation and their potential impact on tumor phenotype. We have found significant differences in phosphorylation of kinases in response to Hras versus Braf activation. Hras activation leads to increased phosphorylation of mTOR effectors, while Braf activation increases CREB activation. Studies are ongoing to identify the molecular mechanism of these observed differences. We have also shown a significant decrease in the growth of HrasG12V/Ptenhom (p=0.0009) and BrafV600E/Ptenhom (p=0.0001) cells treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, suggesting that activated Hras or Braf-even in the context of Pten loss-partially relies on MAPK signaling to reach its full oncogenic potential. We have recently employed a PCR array approach to identify differences in the expression of genes related to the MAPK pathway in HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom cell lines. We noted an up-regulation of Myc, Cdkn1a, and Sfn in BrafV600E/Ptenhom cells in comparison to HrasG12V/Ptenhom cells, which may contribute to the different pathophysiology of HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom tumor sub-types. Because FTCs and PTCs have different responses to therapy, we seek to identify the cellular and physiological consequences of Ras versus Raf activation which will hopefully aid in the discovery of novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for thyroid cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and it accounts for the largest fraction of endocrine cancer-related deaths. The accurate classification of well-differentiated thyroid tumors remains a significant challenge that impacts prognosis and therapeutic choices for patients. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) are the most common and the best characterized types of thyroid cancer, being diagnosed in approximately 80% and 15% of patients, respectively. Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is, after classical PTC, the most commonly diagnosed subtype of PTC, accounting for 9% to 22% of PTC cases. FVPTC exhibits some nuclear features of PTC but has a follicular growth pattern. Diagnosis of FVPTC presents a great challenge to pathologists, as these tumors can have distinct prognoses with variable clinical implications. While the incidence/diagnosis of FVPTC is growing in the U.S., the genetic characteristics of the disease remain poorly understood, and there is a need for complementary molecular assays that can help discriminate between the more benign forms of FVPTC and those that will exhibit an aggressive clinical course.In this study, we performed molecular analysis of 101 FVPTC archival surgical specimens using the SNaPshot multiplexed targeted sequencing platform, to interrogate 90 genetic loci frequently mutated in 21 cancer genes, including the BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and CTNNB1 (-catenin) oncogenes commonly altered in thyroid cancer. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of cDNA obtained from the same tumors was used to test for the presence of RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 gene rearrangements found in PTC, and for PAX8-PPAR gene fusions characteristic of FTC. We detected mutually exclusive genetic aberrations in 68 (67%) FVTPC. These included 25 (25%) BRAF V600E mutations, 26 (26%) mutations in NRAS (22 Q61R and 4 Q61K), 13 (13%) mutations in HRAS (9 Q61R, 3 Q61K, and 1 G13R) and 3 (3%) KRAS G12V mutations. We identified one (1%) single case of PAX8-PPAR gene rearrangement and no RET/PTC gene fusions.Patient medical records and tumor histopathological characteristics will be retrospectively reviewed to determine whether the FVPTC genotype is significantly associated with clinicopathological features of diagnostic and prognostic importance that could help inform therapeutic decisions for this commonly diagnosed endocrine tumor.']",

Targeted BRAF kinase inhibitors such as vemurafenib have shown promising results in clinical trials and off-label use for patients with BRAFV600E-positive tumors. While targeting BRAFV600E offers particular effectiveness and selectivity in inhibiting cancer cells in the short term, resistance does develop. Prior results in our laboratory confirmed that vemurafenib halts DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis in our mutated thyroid cancer cells. In addition, resistant BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer) cells were developed in our laboratory by exposing cells to increasing concentrations of vemurafenib. Resistant cells were characterized by hyperactive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and resistance to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. These additional targets mediating resistance provide an opportunity to devise novel synergistic combination therapies. Since antitumor effects of the widely used antidiabetic agent metformin were observed in thyroid cancer cells and the drug is thought to suppress mTOR, we investigated metformin adjuvant therapy in combination with vemurafenib. Various cell lines including Nthy-ori 3-1 (normal immortalized thyroid cells), BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer), vemurafenib-resistant BCPAP, and 8505c (anaplastic thyroid cancer) were analyzed in terms of cellular viability, apoptosis and expression of cell signaling molecules after exposure to both drugs. We found that the combination of vemurafenib and metformin caused significantly decreased viability in vemurafenib-resistant BCPAP cells. Furthermore, synergistic apoptosis was observed in BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells and 8505c anaplastic thyroid cancer cells in response to the combination treatment.

        "Background":"['Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, aggressive and fatal cancer with a median survival of 3-5 months after diagnosis. Our long-term goal is to develop better therapies based on the biology of ATC that contributes to improved tumor response and a reduced risk of potential side-effects. We recently showed that the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member MCL1 is overexpressed in a subset of ATC and that targeting of MCL1 with quinacrine leads to increased sensitization to the BRAF inhibitor sorafenib. To further investigate the importance of BCL2 family proteins in ATC, we analyzed gene expression data from several published independent gene expression studies. We discovered that both papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and ATC surprisingly overexpress the mRNA of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member NOXA. However, despite the observed overexpression of NOXA mRNA in several ATC cell lines, we find that NOXA protein expression, by contrast, is low. NOXA protein has previously been shown to be subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Indeed, through bioinformatics, we find overexpression of several ubiquitin enzymes in ATC suggesting that the half-life of NOXA protein may be selectively reduced in this tumor type. We are further assessing differences in the turnover of NOXA protein in ATC cells and are investigating if restoring NOXA protein expression may synergize with the pharmacologic targeting of MCL1 and other anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members. Interestingly, through TCGA analysis, we discovered that BCL2 overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in thyroid cancer (THCA) patients. Indeed, treatment with the BCL2/BCLXL inhibitor navitoclax showed encouraging efficacy and synergized with the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 in the ATC cell line 8505C. This was based on the expectation that MLN4924 would rescue NOXA protein expression. We are pursuing mechanistic studies in a larger panel of thyroid cancer cell lines and in vivo efficacy and toxicity studies.

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is increasingly common in the United States. Although prognosis is generally very good, thyroid cancer has a high recurrence rate and there are limited treatment options available for advanced metastatic disease. Since genetic mutations causing over-activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway are found in over 70% of papillary thyroid cancers, molecular inhibitors targeting these kinases are promising therapeutics. A multikinase inhibitor, Sorafenib, was recently FDA-approved for treatment of advanced thyroid cancer as it significantly increased progression-free survival time. To build upon this success, improvement in efficacy and reduction in common side effects may be possible through more targeted approaches. The most common specific mutation to target is BRAFV600E which occurs in 50% of papillary thyroid cancers and 25% of anaplastic thyroid cancers. BRAFV600E is correlated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, resistance to traditional therapy, and cancer-related mortality in papillary thyroid cancer. PLX4032 (Vemurafenib) is a specific kinase inhibitor developed to halt BRAFV600E-mediated excessive activation of the MAPK pathway. BRAFV600E-positive malignant melanoma patients treated with PLX4032 often experience astounding tumor regression followed by development of drug resistance, which is thought to be acquired through signaling via alternative molecules, bypassing the need for BRAFV600E kinase activity. We hypothesized that treatment with PLX4032 would inhibit MAPK signaling and promote an anti-proliferative phenotype in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAFV600E, without having these effects on BRAF-wildtype cells. In BRAF-mutated cells, we also predicted that certain signaling molecules could become activated to circumvent the PLX4032-mediated inhibition, as seen in melanoma. Results demonstrate that PLX4032 inhibits proliferation, causes apoptosis, and arrests cell cycle selectively in BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cells. These phenotypic responses corresponded to diminished phosphorylation of central signaling proteins downstream of BRAF, including MEK, ERK, and mTOR. The mutated papillary thyroid cancer cells express both MAP3K8 (COT) and CRAF, kinases capable of growth-promoting signaling independent of BRAFV600E, in the face of PLX4032 treatment over time. These results indicate that targeted inhibition of BRAFV600E creates powerful anti-tumor effects in thyroid cancer cells, although mechanisms of resistance similar to those seen in melanoma patients may also occur. Detailed investigation into cell signaling pathways that contribute to thyroid cancer progression will allow for more effective combinational targeted molecular therapy and limit development of drug resistance to specific inhibitors such as PLX4032.']",

Among various genetic lesions identified in thyroid cancer, the BRAF V600E mutation is found in 50% of papillary thyroid cancers and affords an opportunity for targeted drug therapy. Our laboratory identified estrogen as a promotional factor in thyroid cancer, as estrogen enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells in vitro. Since the mitotic activity of estrogen is partially mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, we hypothesized that a targeted BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4032, would inhibit estrogen-mediated tumor-promoting activity. Results demonstrate that PLX4032 abrogates estrogen-induced increases in proliferation and invasion of BRAF V600E-mutated BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, this phenomenon was not observed in Nthy-ori 3-1 thyroid cells, which are wild-type immortalized thyroid cells without the BRAF V600E mutation. Expression of estrogen receptor is not modulated by PLX4032 treatment, indicating that PLX4032 targets signal transduction pathways in estrogen-responsive thyroid cells. PLX4032 down-regulates the expression of key signaling molecules of the BRAF pathway, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (p-MEK), extracellular-signal regulated kinases (p-ERK), and mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) in BRAF-mutated BCPAP cells and does not alter the expression of these signaling molecules in wild-type Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. These results demonstrate a direct interlinking of a genetic lesion amenable to drug therapy with the promotional activity of estrogen. These findings will lead to an evaluation of combinational therapy including anti-estrogens and PLX4032 in preclinical animal models and a subset of patients harboring the BRAF V600E mutation.

Methods', '  A clinical next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligationbased libraries to high, uniform coverage for 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer.   Results', '  All but one of the patients with PTC had extensive pulmonary metastases and RAI-refractory disease. Five of the seven patients had tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation and one had NRAS Q61R. The seventh had regional recurrence only and the tumor had no detectable mutations. Treatment with the vemurafenib, targeted therapy highly specific to BRAF V600E, was initiated in one patient, resulting in marked clinical and radiographic responses that were complicated by the development of severe keratoacanthosis and HRASQ61L skin cancer. Three other patients have been enrolled on clinical protocols for MEK-targeted therapy, with clinical responses noted, and one is pending enrollment.   Conclusions', '  In this clinical series of RAI-resistant metastatic papillary thyroid cancers, the majority have clinically meaningful alterations that can potentially guide targeted treatment decisions, particularly in the MEK pathway including BRAF V600E. Therapeutic interventions targeting BRAF activation may be effective in these cancers, and these patients should be enrolled in clinical trials utilizing BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors.']",

Due to the crucial role miRNA-126 plays in angiogenesis, as well as the necessity of angiogenesis in malignancy, miRNA-126 has been found in association with several types of cancer.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and is a potent mediator of vascular permeability, as well as being a key mediator of tumour-associated neoangiogenesis and progression.In this study, we have investigated the role of miRNA-126, VEGF-A and their impact on angiogenesis in thyroid cancers.51 conventional papillary thyroid carcinomas, 37 follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas, 13 undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas, 13 matched lymph nodes metastasis and 21 normal thyroid tissues obtained from non-cancer adjacent to benign lesions were recruited as controls.Firstly, extracted miRNAs from selected samples were loaded on a miRNA microarray chip developed by Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using a pooling method to confirm the expression differences of miRNAs including miRNA-126. Then, miRNA-126 and VEGF-A was tested in individual samples using real-time PCR. In addition, 2 papillary thyroid cancer cell lines (K1 and B-CPAP) and a normal thyroid cell line (Nthy-ori 3-1) were used for the exogenous manipulation of the miRNA-126 and investigation of its effect on VEGF-A expression. The expression of VEGF-A were then measured by immunofluorescence and western blot techniques.The expression of miRNA-126 was noticeably higher in the pool of papillary thyroid carcinoma with metastasis. Using real time PCR, miRNA-126 and VEGF-A were significantly over-expressed in cancer populations compared to controls (p=0.009 and 0.011 respectively). A significant positive correlation between miRNA-126 and VEGF-A expression was also noted (p= 0.00009).Real time PCR of extracted RNA from the cell lines has shown under-expression of miRNA-126 compared to normal cells while VEGF-A RNA and protein were over-expressed. The reduction of VEGF-A protein expression after transfection of miRNA-126 mimic into K1 and B-CPAP, confirms the regulatory role of miRNA-126 on VEGF-A expression in thyroid cancer cell lines.These findings add weight to our previous understanding about the angiogenic role of miRNA-126 in cancer. These experiments provide information on the functional consequences of VEGF manipulation via miRNA on cancer. The data will provide primary information regarding the utility of over-expressing miRNA-126 in cancer management and future development of effective tumour-specific anti-angiogenic therapy.']",

Our study addresses how collagen impacts tumorigenicity of papillary thyroid cancer cells. Cell lines derived from mouse models of papillary thyroid cancer with BRAFV600E mutations and PTEN deletions were grown in the presence or absence of collagen and assessed for cellular proliferation, altered cellular morphology, secretion of microvesicles, and altered cellular signaling.

Common mutations in 4 genes (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS) were assessed using TaqMan Mutation Detection assay. Twelve genes were significantly differentially methylated among 4 comparison groups', ' cancer vs normal, cancer vs adenoma, PTC vs normal, and PTC follicular variant (PTC-FV) vs PTC-Classic.

        "Background":"['The BRAFV600E mutation represents the most common oncogenic event in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Although at a much lower frequency, different missense point mutations (K601E, G474R, G469R) and complex genetic alterations, such as rearrangements (AKAP9-BRAF) or frameshift mutations (V600EK601del, V599ins, V600D-FLAGT601-605ins, T599I-VKSRdel), have also been reported in PTC. In contrast with PTC, no other alteration different from the V600E substitution has been shown in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). In this study, we sought to determine the functional relevance of particular aminoacid residues, within the BRAF kinase domain, that we found mutated in some ATC. Fifty-four ATC were investigated for the existence of mutations at the activation loop, the glicine-rich phosphate-binding loop and the AKT binding sites of BRAF by means of PCR-SSCP and direct sequence. The structural-conformational changes behind punctual, unreported BRAF mutations and their effect on BRAF catalytic activity, substrate binding and downstream MAPK signalling were evaluated. Besides the V600E mutation, two additional point mutations (G615E and G474R) were detected within the BRAF kinase domain. The prevalence of both mutations, G615E (11% = 6 ATC) and G474R (7.4% = 4 ATC), was much lower than that of V600E (20% = 11 ATC). Interestingly, structural biology studies showed that G615E and G474R induced profound conformational changes within the BRAF kinase domain that resulted in reduced catalytic activity, decreased substrate binding and impaired downstream signalling. The G474R mutant, by preventing the N lobe from folding into a well ordered beta sheet structure, caused a broken or distorted phosphorylation-loop (P-loop). Because the P-loop is pivotal for ATP coordination and phosphotransfer reactions, the kinase activity of the BRAF G474R mutant was severely compromised and BRAF was unable to phosphorylate the downstream substrate. The G615E mutant by disrupting the structural integrity of the activation segment in the C lobe could in addition inhibit substrate binding. Significantly, none of the ATC bearing the G615E or the G474R mutation expressed the phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), which specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated and active forms of ERK1 and ERK2. This observation not only supported the existence of impaired BRAF kinase activity in vivo but also suggested the abrogation of intracellular MEK/ERK signalling in those tumours. In summary, this study demonstrates that G615E and G474R behave similarly to D594V and the kinase-dead BRAFK483M mutant, knocking-down BRAF catalytic activity and downstream MEK/ERK signalling. Clinical trials involving the inhibitor of threonine/serine kinases Sorafenib or kinase specific inhibitors targeting constitutively active BRAF will prove inefficient therapeutic strategies in patients with G615E or G474R mutations.']",

In our previous study on thyroid tumor microenvironment, we established that M1 polarized pro-inflammatory macrophages modulate thyroid cancer phenotype. TAMs secretome, consisting of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β, IL6, TNF-α, IL-1β, amongst others, induce epithelial to mesechymal transition (EMT) in thyroid cancer cells promoting tumor metastasis and propagation. In our present study, we used an in vitro model system to assess the effects of secretory molecules called exosomes, in the thyroid tumor microenvironment. We used thyroid cancer cell lines', ' BCPAP (papillary), 8505C (anaplastic) and CGTHW-1 (follicular) to represent the spectrum of clinically observed thyroid cancers. THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cell line was used to denote the inflammatory component. Thyroid cancer cells treated with activated M1 polarized THP-1 macrophage exosomes showed halt in proliferation, transformation to mesenchymal phenotype as well as modulation in expression of EMT markers, such as vimentin and NFk-B, indicative of induction of EMT in thyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, secretory exosomes from anaplastic thyroid cancer cells led to activation of THP-1 monocytes. Since the exosomal cargo is the reflection and fingerprint of its originating parental cells, we profiled exosomal miRNA derived from thyroid cancer cells and THP1 cells. Modulation of various miRNA in follicular and anaplastic thyroid cancer exosomes was observed, when compared to papillary thyroid cancer exosomes. We detected a down regulation of miR-138-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-34a-5p and miR-31-5p in anaplastic and follicular cancer exosomes, which may play a role in promoting cancer invasion and metastasis. In comparison to papillary thyroid cancer exosomes, an upregulation of miR-214-3p, miR-200a-3p, miR-298, miR-299-3p, and miR-302a-3p was ascertained in follicular thyroid cancer exosomes. Conversely, we noted a down regulation of these miRNAs in anaplastic thyroid cancer exosomes. These distinct miRNA expressions in cancer secretome will provide new insights into the tumor development and dissemination. Our findings suggest an important crosstalk between the secretome of thyroid cancer cells and inflammatory cells in tumor microenvironment, defining thyroid cancer phenotype. These exosomal miRNA serve as early diagnostic markers of thyroid cancer differentiation as well as targets for novel therapies specifically for anaplastic thyroid cancer.']",

Ectopic xenograft mouse models were prepared by injecting 8505C cells at the flank of male athymic nude BALB/c mice, aged 6 weeks. After confirming tumor formation at 3 weeks post-injection, the mice were randomly divided into four groups and were each treated under different conditions; DMSO, PLX4032, PHA665752, PLX4032 and PHA665752. After 3 weeks, the pre-established NIRSH probes were injected and confirmed by IVIS imaging. The injected NIRSH probes showed highest uptake in the PLX4032 single treatment group and lowest uptake in the PLX4032 and PHA665752 combination group. Sizes of tumor were verified by MRI which showed correlations with the NIRSH fluorescence imagings. The results suggest that CD44-targetable NIRSHs imaging shows potential as a non-invasive in vivo imaging tool in detecting the increased invasion potential of cancer cells and monitoring appropriate therapeutic effects.']",

Fishers exact test used for mutation frequency comparisons among age groups. Results', ' Median patient age was 65 (range 33-86), 50 patients were male. There was a mean of 4.2 Known Likely Variant (KLV) genomic alterations per case, range 1-11. Adding Variants of Undetermined Significance (VUS) mean was 12.9, range 5-27. The most common KLV-GA were p53 (66%), BRAF (34%), TERT (32%), CDKN2A (32%), NRAS (26%), CDKN2B (20%), NF2 (14.4%), PTEN (13.3%), PIK3CA (12.2%). There were 2 EGFR; 5 JAK2 and 29 GAin the promoter region of TERT. BRAF V600E and NRAS/HRAS alteration were entirely mutually exclusive, and one case demonstrated both BRAF V600E and KRAS. Co-occuring mutations were CDKN2A with p53 (p=0.04). Some GA were more frequent in patients greater than 70 yrs of age such as BRAF, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, JAK2; while others were more common in 50 yrs patients like PTEN, NRAS.

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine related cancer with the incidences occurring three to four times higher in women than in men, thus suggesting that estrogen plays a critical role in thyroid cancer progression. We have previously demonstrated that thyroid cancer cells express functionally active estrogen receptors (ER), ER- and ER- and that estrogen enhances the metastatic propensity of thyroid cancer cells by increased migration, adhesion and invasion, potentially mediated by enhanced secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), MMP-2 and MMP-9. However, to successfully grow and metastasize, thyroid cancer cells must initiate endothelial cell induced neo-vascularization such that adequate blood supply is maintained within the tumor. In an effort to define the interacting factors between endothelial cells and thyroid cancer epithelial cells, we developed an in vitro cell culture based system using three thyroid cancer cell lines (a papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line B-CPAP, and two follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines, CGTH-W-1 and ML-1) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs). We observed that conditioned medium from estrogen treated thyroid cancer cells induced prolific tubulogenesis of endothelial cells which was abrogated in presence of the anti-estrogen, fulvestrant or neutralizing antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We also observed that conditioned medium from thyroid cancer cells was able to induce migration of endothelial cells, again a phenomenon which was abrogated by fulvestrant and VEGF neutralizing antibodies. We further demonstrate that estrogen acts as a modulator of endothelial-epithelial cell interaction by modulating angiogenic factors that include VEGF and MMPs, which in turn induce mitogenic signaling and help promote and maintain cellular tumor heterogeneity. Estrogen modulated tumor modulating factors are viewed as novel therapeutic targets and provide evidence that the higher incidence of thyroid cancer in females is potentially attributed to the presence of a functional ER that mediates upregulation of pro-angiogenic factors and thus anti-estrogens can be potentially used to treat and/or prevent thyroid cancer.']",

This oncogenic mutation in the BRAF gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway and results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. BRAF V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). However, it is challenging to identify patients with this mutation. Currently, the gold standard is sequencing of the tumor DNA, but this method is not practical for routine practice. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a relatively easy diagnostic tool to detect proteins in paraffin-embedded tissues. The major goal of this study was to compare detection of BRAF V600E by sequencing and IHC using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody. This clone is mutation specific and can distinguish the V600E mutation in BRAF from the wild type BRAF protein.Methods', \" Tissues from sixty-nine patients with colon cancer (N=40) and thyroid cancer (N=29) were evaluated for the BRAF V600E mutation.

Out of 47 cases staining positive for BRAF V600E (VE1) 43 cases were confirmed by sequencing. Of the four discordant cases, one case was weakly positive by IHC (score 1), two cases that were negative by sequencing showed stronger BRAF V600E (VE1) staining (score 2) and one case contained a different mutation at codon 600 (V600K). Overall, there was high concordance between IHC and DNA sequencing. Using the sequencing as the reference standard, negative predictive value was 100%, positive predictive value was 91% with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85%. Overall percentage agreement across all cases was 94% (65/69 cases). Next-generation sequencing will be used to evaluate discordant cases for BRAF V600 mutation status.Conclusion', ' Detection of the BRAF V600E mutation is emerging as an important biomarker with diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive potential.

The BRAFV600E point mutation represents the most common oncogenic event in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).

Small molecule inhibitors targeting either the BRAF V600E protein or upstream or downstream kinases involved in MAPK signalling are currently under pre-clinical or clinical investigation in advanced, metastatic, I131 resistant thyroid cancers. Recently, immunohistochemical (IHC) studies on PTCs, using the VE1 mouse anti-human BRAF V600E antibody have shown to be a reliable means for detecting the BRAFV600E mutation in a clinical setting without molecular genotyping units. In this study we sought to determine the usefulness of the VE1 antibody for detecting the BRAF V600E mutant protein in a series of 103 aggressive thyroid cancers (59 PDCs and 44 UCs) previously characterized by PCR-SSCP for the presence of BRAF mutations in exons 11 and 15. The BRAFV600E mutation was present in 10/59 PDCs (17%) and 11/44 UCs (25%). Immunohistochemistry revealed 9 mutated PDCs (sensitivity 90%) and 9 mutated UCs (82% sensitivity). The staining intensity in BRAF V600E mutated samples ranged from weak to strong. Non valuable results were found in 3 PDCs and 4 UCs.

Design', ' We analyzed 70 PTCs diagnosed in a Ukrainian-American cohort who were < 18 y.o. at the time of Chernobyl and received 0.008-8.6 Gy of I-131 to the thyroid. Thyroid doses were estimated based on radioactivity measurements taken shortly after the accident, environmental transport models, and interview data.

Results', ' Identified mutations and patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in I-131 dose for both BRAF and RAS mutations (p=0.005 and 0.026).

There is practically no overlap between RET/PTC, RAS and BRAF mutations in PTC, the lack of concordance for these mutations provides compelling genetic evidence for the requirement of this signaling system for transformation to PTC. However, the effect of these genetic alterations in other signaling pathways remains unclear, which could, at least in part, cooperates in transformation. Recently, Notch signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis in other cancer types. In this study, we test the hypothesis that RET/PTC and BRAFT1799A oncogenes crosstalks and regulates Notch pathway. Methods', ' TPC-1 and BCPAP (human PTC cells harboring RET/PTC1 rearrangement and BRAFT1799A mutation, respectively) were treated with gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) and proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay and growth curve; cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. PCCL3 cells harboring Doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3 and BRAFT1799A (PC-BRAF) were used to analyze protein and gene expression by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Notch1 protein expression was analyzed in transgenic mice (Tg-BRAF) which harbor targeted expression of BRAFT1799A restricted to thyroid gland. Results', ' PTC cells treated with GSI decreased the percentage of viable cell in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the growth rate. Cell cycle analysis in PTC cells showed enhancement of DNA fragmentation and increased apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the GSI treatment in PTC cells modulates cell cycle related genes, increasing CDKN1A and CDKN1B gene expression and reducing CCND1, MCM6, CKS2, and MADL2 expression. Conditional activation of RET/PTC3 and BRAFT1799A in PTC3-5 and PC-BRAF cells, respectively, showed a sustained enhancement in pERK protein expression, increased Notch1 protein and gene expression and Hes1 gene expression, the target gene of Notch signaling. Furthermore, transgenic mice Tg-BRAF showed a stronger stain for Notch1 in follicular and stromal cells. Treating PTC cells with MEK inhibitors, U0126 or PD96059, reduces NOTCH1 and HES1 gene expression. The combination of GSI with MEK inhibitor enhances the growth suppression promote by MAPK signaling inhibition in PTC cell proliferation.

        "Background":"['Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, highly aggressive form of thyroid cancer that frequently is resistant to conventional therapy and therefore requires the development of efficacious novel therapy. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits the RAF, MEK and ERK kinases, was recently approved by the FDA for late stage metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer but appears to have limited activity in ATC by itself. Sorafenib-based drug combinations with complimentary drug targets are being pursued and evaluated preclinically. However, sorafenib generates a significant number of adverse events in thyroid cancer patients and drug combinations including sorafenib needs to be carefully tailored with respect to toxicity and efficacy. We have previously shown that quinacrine, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NFKB signaling, combine favorably with several cytotoxic drugs to target hepatocellular and colorectal cancer cells. Quinacrine is an inexpensive drug, has a well established safety profile in human subjects and is being evaluated in cancer clinical trials. Subsequently, we decided to evaluate the efficacy of the drug combination of quinacrine and sorafenib in ATC. Our combinatorial dose-response modulation of quinacrine with sorafenib suggests a synergistic drug-drug interaction with respect to growth stasis in a panel of ATC cells in vitro, as defined by Chou-Talalay. Furthermore, in vivo the drug combination of sorafenib and quinacrine significantly improved survival compared to vehicle control and the current first line chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in a mouse thyroid orthotopic xenograft model of ATC. Dose-escalation toxicity studies in mice suggest that the drug combination was well tolerated and did not trigger synergistic toxicities compared to either drug alone. Significantly less gastrointestinal injury, the most commonly observed toxicity in our study, was present following treatment with the drug combination of sorafenib and quinacrine compared to treatment with doxorubicin alone. Western blot analysis suggests that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 is a target for the drug combination. Indeed, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of resected ATC and non-neoplastic thyroid tissues from patients confirmed overexpression of Mcl-1 in ATC indicating target availability. Interestingly, multi-regression analysis of our patient IHC data suggest that high Mcl-1 expression together with tumor size prognosticated poor survival in ATC patients suggesting that Mcl-1 overexpression was linked to a more aggressive tumor behavior. In conclusion, our findings suggest that quinacrine in combination with sorafenib may be a novel and potentially cost effective therapeutic strategy to target Mcl-1, whose expression potentially may be linked to the disease progression of ATC.']",

The addition of LAP, a HER2/HER3 kinase inhibitor, sensitizes the cell to growth suppression by BRAF inhibitors (Cancer Discov 5(3)', '520, 2013).

        "Background":"[\"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) comprises 2% of all thyroid cancers and its median survival rate remains poor. ATC is frequently resistant to conventional therapy and therefore it is essential to expand the number of treatment options for ATC. Proto-oncogenes RET, RAS and BRAF are some of the best targets described in thyroid cancer. Sorafenib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits RAF, MEK and ERK kinases among other targets and is therefore being evaluated in several phase II/III clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Quinacrine, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NFKB signaling, is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials. We have previously shown the effectiveness of quinacrine in combination with cytotoxic drugs in hepatocellular and colon carcinoma cells acts by inhibiting NFKB, Mcl-1, and angiogenesis in tumor cell lines that are deficient in p53. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of quinacrine in combination with sorafenib on a panel of human ATC cells. Quinacrine as a single agent effectively inhibits growth and promote apoptosis of ATC cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by CellTiter-Glo and sub-G1 analysis respectively. Combinatorial dose-response modulation of quinacrine with sorafenib suggests a synergistic drug-drug interaction with respect to growth stasis of ATC cells in vitro, as defined by Chou-Talalay. Western blot analysis suggest that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1, over-expressed in a number of solid tumors, is efficiently down-regulated in the ATC cell line 8505C by the combination of quinacrine and sorafenib. We also observe that the active form of transcription factor Stat3 is down-regulated by both quinacrine and sorafenib. In contrast to chloroquine that inhibits autophagy, our previous results have not shown that quinacrine's anti-tumor efficacy involves alterations in autophagy. Furthermore, sorafenib and quinacrine significantly improve survival in a mouse thyroid orthotopic in vivo xenograft model of ATC. We are currently exploring the detailed molecular mechanism of the quinacrine and sorafenib drug synergy and associated anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we are exploring the possibility of performing in vivo assays of the therapy combination with clinical samples. Our findings suggest that quinacrine in combination with sorafenib may be a novel and potentially cost effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment ATC.\"]",

Well-known miFTC and FA driver genes, NRAS (66.67%), HRAS (11.11%), and EIF1AX (11.11%), were identified in wiFTC. TERT mutation was found in all samples which can explain its aggressive feature.

        "Background":"['Activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutations occur in 50% of melanoma, 45% of papillary thyroid cancer and 10% of colon cancer. BRAF inhibitors have elicited significant clinical response in melanomas but acquired resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Therefore, consideration of new treatment strategies to block activity of mutant BRAF and deter therapeutic resistance is warranted. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone required for the stability of hundreds of client proteins, including the RAF family of kinases, and has emerged as a highly relevant anticancer target. Ganetespib is a second generation, small molecule HSP90 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials. To investigate the potential for ganetespib in the treatment of melanoma we evaluated its preclinical activity as monotherapy, and in combination with targeted agents, in cells sensitive or resistant to BRAF inhibitors. Ganetespib displayed potent anticancer activity in a large panel of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma, thyroid and colon cancer cell lines, with IC50 between 4 and 40 nM. Further analysis showed that ganetespib disrupted oncogenic signaling by inducing the destabilization of mutant BRAF and subsequent inactivation of MEK and ERK. Levels of wild-type BRAF were only slightly reduced in response to ganetespib treatment, implying that the stability of activated BRAF is more reliant on HSP90 and that ganetespib may selectively deplete oncogenic forms of BRAF. Notably, ganetespib treatment also led to depletion of CRAF, which is implicated in driving therapeutic resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In an effort to maximize antitumor activity, we combined low levels of ganetespib with BRAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and observed increased cytotoxicity compared to single agent treatment. Both the BRAF and MEK inhibitors were cytostatic on their own, which may be due to continued PI3K/mTOR signaling. We subsequently assayed the combination of ganetespib with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and observed synergistic increases in cell death. Importantly, ganetespib was capable of blocking the feedback activation on MAPKK induced by a MEK inhibitor as well as the activation of ERK by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. To determine if these results translated in vivo, similar combinations were performed in BRAF mutant human melanoma xenografts. Co-administration of ganetespib with either a BRAF or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppressed in vivo tumor growth to a greater extent compared to monotherapy. Finally, we show that ganetespib effectively blocked MAPK signaling and killed RPMI-7951 melanoma cells (IC50 = 4 nM), which are resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors due to the overexpression of COT. In conclusion, targeting HSP90 with ganetespib represents a promising approach for the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-driven cancers and may be especially relevant in the context of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.']",

A trial with vemurafenib for thyroid cancer patients is now in progress.We compared the response of thyroid and melanoma cell lines harboring BRAFV600E to vemurafenib and found that the majority of thyroid cancer cells were refractory to the inhibitor (IC50 > 1.5 M). In addition, thyroid cancer cell lines showed a rebound in pERK beginning 6h post-treatment and a transient activation of pAKT. Expression profiling and pRTK array screens of PLX4032-treated cells showed higher expression and activation of HER family receptors, particularly HER2 and HER3. Phosphorylation of HER3 represented the most consistent PLX4032-dependent RTK activated across thyroid cancer cell lines (5/6 lines tested) and was not detectable in any of the melanoma or colorectal cancer cells we investigated. HER3 phosphorylation was also induced by the allosteric MEK inhibitor PD0325901 in thyroid cancers of TPO-Cre/LSL-BrafV600E mice. We identified HER2 as the main HER3 heterodimerization partner, which was activated via a neuregulin-dependent autocrine loop, which was specific to the thyroid cancer lineage, as it was not observed in either melanoma or colorectal BRAF-mutant lines. HER3 transcription was induced by MAPK inhibition, via dissociation of the CTBP1/2 transcriptional repressors from the HER3 gene promoter. Finally, the HER2/HER3 kinase inhibitor lapatinib sensitized BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells to growth inhibition by RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, providing rationale for combination therapies in this disease. Hence, the early response of BRAF-mutant cancers to selective MAPK pathway inhibitors is marked by the relaxation of oncoprotein-driven negative feedback events, which differ between tumors of various lineages, and which predict a requirement for distinct therapeutic strategies.']",

Retinoblastoma (Rb) inhibits cell cycle progression and is inactivated by CDK 4/6, which is the target for ribociclib. Nearly all differentiated thyroid cancers are Rb negative, conversely nearly 100% of ATC expresses intact Rb which may be crucial for rapid cell cycle progression. Ribociclib is a CDK 4/6 inhibitors that slows cell cycle progression and DNA replication in tumors with functional Rb. The p16 protein similarly inhibits CDK4/6; if p16 levels are high Rb is phosphorylated and thus inactive. p16 is low in ATC, and from our comprehensive genomic analysis 30% of ATC lacks the p16 gene CDKN2a.

When a cutoff of IC50 <500nM or >70% Inhibition at 1uM after 6 days of culture was used 83% out of 47 melanoma cell lines were sensitive to the treatment with the MEK inhibitor. Sensitivity to MEK162 was independent of BRAFV600E andNRASQ61mutation status in this cell line panel. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed upon exposure to MEK162 using flow cytometry. MEK162 led to a G1 arrest and marked increase in apoptotic cells in the majority of the sensitive melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin and oncogenic driver mutations. Western blots were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to MEK162 in the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a decrease in pERK in all the cell lines tested regardless of their mutational status and the in vitro sensitivity. We observed an increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and wild type for NRAS and BRAF mutations cell lines than in BRAFV600Emutant cell lines. We found pAKT and pS6 decreased in the NRAS and BRAF mutant cell lines after treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of the mTOR pathway by MEK162 may be crucial for the sensitivity to the drug. Conclusion. These data provide evidence for supporting the use of MEK162 in the treatment of patients with melanoma.']",

Embelin, a XIAP inhibitor, is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory and apoptotic activities. Recent reports suggest that embelin interferes the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signal pathway. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer efficacy of embelin by measuring its effects on apoptosis of thyroid cancer cell lines. We also explored the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that embelin induced the apoptosis of human thyroid cancer cell lines, such as FTC-133, CAL-62, KTC-1, and 8505C. The effect was stronger in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines (KTC-1 and 8505C) than wild-type cell lines (FTC-133 and CAL-62). The effect of embelin on cell apoptosis was associated with increased phosphorylation of p38. SB203580 inhibited the embelin mediated induction of cleaved caspase-3 activity in V600E mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. Interestingly, embelin induced apoptosis in BRAF wild type cancer cell lines, even after treatment of SB203580. These results indicated that another signaling pathway, not a p38 pathway, might be existed for embelin induced apoptosis in BRAF wild type thyroid cancer cell. In conclusion, embelin-induced XIAP suppression resulted in an increase of apoptosis via phosphorylation of p38 in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. Regulation of XIAP activity may be potentially useful as a treatment of thyroid cancer, especially in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer.']",

In particular, one of the three isoforms of RAF, BRAF, presents activating somatic mutations in 60% of melanomas, 50% of thyroid cancers, 10% of colon and 20% ovarian carcinomas. The most common BRAF mutation, substitution of glutamic acid for valine at position 600 within the activation segment of the kinase domain, accounts for 90% of mutated BRAF cases, and results in elevated kinase activity with consequent enhanced promotion of cell survival and proliferation. BRAF selective inhibitors as vemurafenib and dabrafenib have recently shown excellent results in patients with advanced melanoma expressing BRAF V600E mutant form. Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo properties of a novel potent and selective BRAF inhibitor belonging to the arylthiazole class of compounds. This, NMS-P285, is a potent inhibitor of both wild-type and mutated BRAF, with no cross-reactivity in a panel of 61 kinases. This compound occupies the ATP-binding pocket of the activated form of the enzyme (DFG motif in), partly filling the kinase back pocket, (i.e. type I  inhibitors).

        "Background":"['EIF1AX (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A) is a component of the translation pre-initiation complex (PIC). Recurrent EIF1AX mutations, first reported in uveal melanomas, are found in 1% of papillary thyroid cancers in a mutually exclusive manner with other oncogenic driver events (BRAF, RAS, and oncogenic fusions). By contrast, they are enriched in advanced thyroid cancers (9% of anaplastic and 11% poorly-differentiated thyroid cancers), and are strongly associated with RAS mutations (p<0.0001). EIF1AX mutations cluster in the N-terminal (NTT) or C-terminal tails (CTT). EIF1AX NTT missense mutations in thyroid cancer occur within the first 15 amino acids, whereas the CTT mutation disrupts a splice acceptor site at exon 6 (A113splice). A113splice is the most prevalent defect and is private to this disease, and results in two differentially spliced mRNAs', ' (1) Cryptic splice variant', ' by use of a cryptic acceptor site in exon 6 that leads to a 132 AA protein that excludes 12 AA; (2) Truncated splice variant', ' by retaining intron 5, leading to a 115 AA truncated protein. EIF1AX mutants retain the ability to recruit the ternary complex, as shown by co-IP with EIF2 after ectopic expression of NTT or A113splice EIF1AX mutants in HEK293T cells, or after CRISPR-mediated knock-in of A113splice into Cal62 RAS-mutant thyroid cancer cells. The EIF1AX mutants had greater affinity to EIF5 compared to WT, consistent with a more stable PIC. As translation initiation is a rate-limiting step, the altered affinity of EIF1AX mutants to PIC components could impact the rate of protein synthesis. We tested this by L-azidohomoalanine labeling, which showed contrasting roles of the two A113-generated splice variants expressed at endogenous levels', ' i.e. the cryptic splice variant increased protein synthetic rate, whereas the truncated splice variant strongly inhibited protein translation. Despite inhibiting translation, the truncated splice variant showed a paradoxical increase in 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Upon A113splice knock-in, where both variants are expressed, translation is increased, which we hypothesize results from the combined effects of 4EBP1 phosphorylation, caused by relief of negative feedback events upstream in the pathway, with increased PIC assembly caused by the cryptic splice variant. We are currently determining whether the altered rate of protein synthesis is global or selective. Of note, cells expressing the cryptic, but not the truncated splice form, showed a transforming phenotype as assessed by soft agar colony formation. As EIF1AX mutations co-occur with RAS mutations in advanced thyroid cancers, it is likely that RAS-induced PI3K-AKT/mTOR signaling may provide a further cooperative benefit and play a key role in disease progression, and in generating specific tumor cell dependencies.']",

The expression of E-cadherin, vimentin and Twist were determined by immunoblot analysis. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by scratch assay and by Boyden chamber assay.

        "Background":"['Cancer of the thyroid gland accounts for 3.8% of all cancer cases in the United States as indicated by the SEER report by the NCI. The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased three-fold over the last thirty years and the American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately 62,450 new cases and 1,950 deaths due to the disease in the country in 2015. Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy with a three-fold higher incidence in women than in men. However, PTC exhibits increased aggressiveness with poor prognosis in men diagnosed with the disease. These incongruent observations led us to explore the role of androgen and androgen receptor in this disease. We found an approximately 70% decrease in median AR expression (p<0.0001) in 24 PTC patient tissue samples, compared to matched, normal thyroid tissue. Preliminary data from our lab indicate that androgen receptor (AR) acts as a negative regulator of growth as evidenced by a statistically significant 48% decrease in proliferation over 72 hours upon 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) addition to 8505c anaplastic/PTC cells stably transfected with AR (clone 84E7). Transcriptional profiling using RNAseq and gene ontology analysis, on 48 hour DHT treated 84E7 cells revealed significant changes in gene expression associated with proliferation (474 genes, p = 2.4E-24) and cell cycle progression (129 genes, p = 6.54E-6). Continuous AR activation (3 to 6 days) resulted in G1 growth arrest, not accompanied by cell death, but rather a flattened, vacuolized cell morphology, indicative of senescence. This was substantiated by an increase in SA-Gal positivity from background 2.47% to approximately 65.5%, which was attenuated by the AR antagonist, flutamide. Three to six day DHT exposure resulted in increased total RNA and protein content measured using Acridine Orange and Sulforhodamine B, respectively. Senescent 84E7 cells failed to resume growth when transferred into DHT-free medium for 3 days, suggesting a permanent growth arrest. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), implicated in Rb-mediated senescence, were found to be doubled by day 6 of AR activation, compared to control cells. Additionally, using flow cytometry, we found increased p21, p27, cyclin D1, FOXO1, and phosphorylation of FOXO1 by days 3-6, suggesting that AR-dependent senescence is mediated via p21 and p27 by FOXO1/3 proteins. Furthermore, cytokine profiling of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) would aid in defining the pro-tumorigenic or tumor-suppressive potential of androgen-induced senescent thyroid cancer cells. Our study elucidates the induction of senescence as a novel function of AR activation in thyrocytes and may indicate a protective role of AR activation in the decreased incidence of thyroid cancer in men.']",

Adoptive T-cell immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CARTs) is showing encouraging results in the treatment of cancer, but development is challenged by the availability of suitable target antigens. We identified glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor alpha 4 (GFR4), which associates with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, as a putative antigenic target for CAR-based therapy of MTC. Using RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope) and quantitative RT-PCR, we show that GFR4 is highly expressed in MTC. Normal tissue expression of GFR4 mRNA is restricted to parafollicular cells (C-cells) within the thyroid, the normal cell type from which MTC originates, and normal thymus.Based upon the highly restricted expression, we generated two high affinity single chain variable fragments (scFvs) targeting GFR4 isoforms a and b by selecting a nave rabbit antibody library by phage display. Second generation CARs bearing the CD137 costimulatory domain were constructed using these GFR4-specific scFvs. GFR4-specific CARTs trigger antigen-dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine production in vitro, and they are able to control pre-established TT cell tumors in an immunodeficient mouse xenograft model of MTC.

Over-expression of miR-17-92 inhibited Tgfbr2 and Smad4 protein levels that reflected in impaired responsiveness to recombinant TGF inhibitory signal. Using the 3TP-lux reporter gene assay, that contains TGF signaling activation responsive sequences, we observed that recombinant TGF treatment in PCCl3- cells resulted in a 8.0 and 12.3-fold increase in luciferase activity at concentrations of 1ng/ml and 2ng/mL of recombinant TGF, respectively, while a 4.3 and 5.6-fold increase is observed in PCCl3-miR-17-92 cells. Moreover, PCCl3-miR-17-92 showed increases cell proliferation and cell viability in 18% and 9%, respectively, in comparison to PCCL3-.

        "Background":"['BackgroundThe most common activating B-raf mutations (T1799A point mutation) lead to a substitution of valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) at the position 600 of the amino acid sequence. This oncogenic mutation in the B-raf gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway which results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. B-raf V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). Currently, the gold standard to identify B-raf mutations is sequencing of the tumor DNA. However this method is not practical for routine clinical detection due high risk of contamination and low sensitivity. Recent development of therapeutic intervention using B-raf inhibitors requires an accurate and rapid detection system for B-raf mutations.MethodsHere we developed a new methodology for the rapid and reliable detection of B-raf (V600) mutations by combination of the modified real-time PCR primers, peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamping and MGB probe, named of PM-PCR method. In this assay, the mutant gene is selectively amplified by the modified PCR primers and the amplicon extending signals are collected by the taqman-MGB probe in a real-time fashion, while the amplification of wild-type B-raf DNA is completely blocked by the specifically designed PNA with a higher annealing temperature. The assay procedure includes only one step of sample loading to avoid potential contamination. The PM-PCR method can detect 3-10 copies of the mutant gene stably in somatic cells with background of a total of 10ng wild-type genomic DNA.Tumor samples from 97 patients with malignant melanoma (N=20) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (N=78) were evaluated for the B-raf V600mutation. Genomic DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue sections and analyzed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing for comparison.ResultsAmong the 97 tested samples, 74% (72/97) of them were positive for B-raf V600 mutation detected by our ARMS-PM assay, while 60.8% (59/97) were detected positive by Sanger sequencing. All the 25 negative cases detected by our assay were confirmed by Sanger sequencing with a concordance rate 100% (25/25). The overall concordance between our assay and Sanger sequencing was (87%) .ConclusionWe have developed a new method for detection of B-raf V600 mutation by combination of the modified real-time PCR primers, PNA and MGB probes (PM-PCR method). The new assay demonstrates significantly improved sensitivity and feasibility for clinical application. <!EndFragment>']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' High dose iodine intake is used as a prophylactic measure to protect thyroid from deleterious effects of radioactive iodine in case of nuclear accidents. In vitro, high concentration iodine delays oncogenic effects of RET/PTC3 in thyroid follicular cells, although its role during BRAF oncogene activation remains unclear. BRAF mutation (T1799A) is the most prevalent alteration during thyroid follicular cells oncogenesis leading to thyroid cancer. BRAFT1799A is associated to aggressive thyroid tumors and poor prognosis. High levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b and miR-92, components of miR-17-92 cluster, are associated with several aggressive tumors such as lung cancer and thyroid carcinoma. Aberrant miRNA expression may cooperate to tumorigenesis as it regulates protein levels of different target mRNA from several signaling pathways. Therefore, in this study we aim at analyzing the role of iodine in miRNAs activated by BRAFT1799A oncogene. Methods', ' Cell culture and treatment', ' BRAF9-6 cells derived from rat thyroid follicular cells express conditionally BRAFT1799A in the presence of doxaciclin (Dox, at 1g/mL). Early BRAFT1799A activation was analyzed after 48 hours of induction (Dox group). Five-days long iodine treatment was performed using culture media containing 10-5M sodium iodide (NaI group), and dox was added at day 3 (Dox+NaI group). Control group (Ctr) was performed in the absence of Dox and NaI; gene expression', ' detection of miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b and snoRNA was performed by qPCR. protein levels', ' Smad4 protein expression was investigated by Western-blotting using specific monoclonal antibodies against Smad4. Alfa-tubulin was detected as load control. Results', ' Early effects of BRAFT1799A in miRNA expression involve activation of miR-17-92 cluster in thyroid follicular cells. Conditional induction of BRAFT1799A (Dox group) results in a 85.8- fold, 634.3 fold and 141.6-fold increase in miR-19a, miR-19b and miR-18a, respectively, compared to control (Ctr group). Moreover, treating cells with iodine before BRAF activation (Dox+NaI group) resulted in partial or complete abrogation of this effect, with expression levels of miR-18a, miR-19a and miR-19b in 2.7-fold, 2.36-fold and 0.66-fold of Ctr group, respectively. Bioinformatic target prediction for miR-19a and miR-19b shows that Smad4 mRNA contain predicted binding sites in the 3-UTR for these miRNAs. Smad4 is the key transducer of TGFB inhibitory signalling, frequently misbalanced in cancer. BRAF induction reduced Smad4 protein levels, effect abolished by previous iodine treatment, suggesting Smad4 as a possible target of miR-19a and miR-19b. Conclusion', ' Iodine exerts a protective effect in thyroid follicular cells, abrogating BRAFT1799A induced activation of miR-17-92 cluster key oncogenic miRNAs, miR-19a and miR-19b, and restoring Smad4 protein levels.']",

The V600E mutation is found in the vast majority of these cases and is an activating mutation, conferring transforming and immortalization potential to cells. CEP-32496 is a potent BRAF inhibitor that demonstrates selective anti-tumor activity against BRAFV600E mutated cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. CEP-32496 is orally bioavailable and demonstrates in vivo pharmacodynamic inhibition of pMEK and pERK signaling and tumor stasis and regressions in BRaf V600E cell line tumor xenograft models. In the current study Champions primary human TumorGraft models of melanoma and colorectal carcinoma possessing the B-Raf V600E genotype were utilized to determine the oral anti-tumor efficacy of CEP-32496 in more clinically relevant models in order to support the clinical development of CEP-32496. Champions Oncology has developed an innovative platform for oncology research that utilizes the implantation of primary human tumors in immune-deficient mice in a manner that preserves the biological properties of the original human tumor. Previous reports have demonstrated the correlation between the responses observed in Champions TumorGraft models and clinical responses from the patients from which the models were derived. CEP-32496 was evaluated in a panel of nine Champions TumorGraft models and compared to the recently FDA-approved B-RAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (Roche/Genentech/Daiichi) in order to determine the potential clinical activity of the compound. Mice bearing established Champions TumorGrafts were treated orally with 35 mg/kg bid of CEP-32496 or vemurafenib for 25 to 35 days and anti-tumor efficacy and tolerability were evaluated. Results demonstrated that in 5/9 (56% of the Tumorgraft models) CEP-32496 showed significantly superior in vivo efficacy compared to vemurafenib. Equivalent anti-tumor efficacy was observed in 3/9 (33%) TumorGraft models with both CEP-32496 and vemurafenib. Both inhibitors demonstrated comparable tolerability profiles. Additional TumorGraft models are currently under evaluation and retrospective bioinformatics analyses are planned to determine potential signatures of response and resistance for CEP-32496 to facilitate both its clinical development and potential differentiation from vemurafenib. Overall, these results demonstrate that CEP-32496 shows comparable to superior efficacy in this panel of Champions primary TumorGraft models when compared to vemurafenib.']",

Due to the lack of distinguishing morphology, 10-25% of FNAs are termed indeterminate and required surgery. However, only 35% of them are found to have cancer. There is a need for a more accurate and minimally invasive cancer diagnostic technology. Our objective is to develop an inexpensive, point-of-care molecular diagnostic platform to isolate and detect thyroid specific proteins to enable real-world use of biomarkers to inform patient care. b) In this study, we engineer a miniature ion exchange column within a plastic (cyclic olefin polymer), disposable lab-on-a-chip platform for sample preparation and protein purification using microfluidic channels with a specialized porous polymer monolith (PPM)-based resin bed. We capitalized on the finding that cancer cells exhibit differential protein expressional patterns compared to normal thyroid cells by targeting thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1), a thyroid specific enhancer binding protein, as a biomarker for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. The ability to capture and release TTF-1 from the papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cell line was evaluated via western blot. We also tested various types of thyroid samples obtained from malignant and benign human thyroid nodules. c) We compared the efficiency of a small-scale protein prep using a commercial gravity column versus our lab-on-a-chip column. Our method showed TTF-1 protein was detectable from the lysate of 5x104 cultured BCPAP cancer cell line. In contrast, it was not detectable when purified by gravity ion-exchange column. We next showed that one can maximize the concentration of protein eluted from as fewer cells as possible. We found that by titrating the elution volume per fraction down to 10 l, the final concentration of eluted protein can be increased, and hence increase the downstream LOD to 104 cells. Next, we evaluated our extraction and purification system by using 10 mg patient thyroid tissue samples. We tested 11 human thyroid specimens for TTF-1 protein capture. They were all found to be positive which correlated with the official histopathological findings. All tissue extracts had measurable levels of TTF-1 protein and the levels of the TTF-1 were variable in the tissue specimens. We also tested one negative thyroid specimen. No TTF-1 protein was found. d) Our microfluidic protein extraction and purification system is a platform technology that may allow for optimal use of low-volume sample preparation such as we see in thyroid biopsies. This manner, when combined with an on-chip ELISA assay, would be a simple, cost effective test that gives the doctor all the needed information quickly in a single test.

M1 polarized macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines which induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells; a process where epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal traits, thus facilitating tissue infiltration and consequent metastasis. EMT as a marker of cancer progression is understudied in thyroid cancer. In our present study, we evaluated the crosstalk between the macrophages and the epithelial cells in the thyroid tumor microenvironment with the use of an in vitro model system consisting of an immortalized thyroid cell line (Nthy-ori 3-1), three papillary cancer cell lines (BCPAP, 8505C and TPC-1) and one follicular cancer cell line (CGTHW-1). We observed the halt in proliferation of the thyroid cancer cells as the epithelial cells differentiate into mesenchymal cells under the influence of activated macrophage conditioned media. We also observed a statistically significant (p<0.05) upregulation of migration and invasion of thyroid tumor cells in presence of macrophage conditioned media. Using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from the thyroid cancer cell lines, we observed that EMT markers including E-cadherin, -catenin, vimentin, NFk-B, snail, slug and twist are modulated in response to activated macrophage conditioned media. Downregulation of E-cadherin, required for maintenance of stable junction and -catenin essential for cell-cell adhesion was noticed in response to macrophage conditioned media. Transcription factors like NFk-B, snail and slug were translocated to the nucleus, which is indicative of the initiation of EMT. Our data provides evidence that macrophage secreted proteins play a crucial role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in thyroid tumor advancement and metastasis. We have successfully identified some significant markers including transcription factors such as NFk-B, slug, twist and snail that play a critical role in the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in thyroid cancer.

The majority of canine TCCs are invasive, intermediate to high grade tumors sharing similarities with human muscle invasive TCCs in risk factors, histology, sites of metastasis, and therapeutic response to single agents. Whole exome sequencing of canine TCC tumors was performed to identify somatic mutations in known cancer driver and repressor genes that could potentially contribute to canine TCC pathogenesis. A valine to glutamic acid mutation in BRAF homologous to the activating V600E mutation identified in human melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancers was identified in 70% of sequenced tumors. Sensitivity to the BRAFV600E inhibitor Vemurafenib was tested in three BRAF mutant canine TCC cell lines (Bliley, Tyler1 and Tyler2) and two BRAF wild type canine TCC cell lines (Angus1 and Kinsey). All five canine TCC cell lines exhibited IC50s greater than 10μM, with BRAF mutant cell lines being slightly more sensitive. These sensitivity ranges are similar to those of some mutant human colorectal cancer cell lines, indicating that additional mechanisms may contribute to Vemurafenib resistance. Western blot analysis was performed to measure relative abundance of pERK, a downstream target of BRAF, in canine TCCs in response to serum starvation. All TCC cell lines showed sustained pERK expression in the absence of serum, indicating constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The five canine TCC lines were treated with 15μM Vemurafenib for 6 and 24 hours and their lysates were analyzed for pERK protein expression. pERK abundance was decreased in only the BRAF mutant cell lines after 6 hours of treatment. However, this decrease was less pronounced after 24 hours, suggesting that resistance mechanisms are bypassing BRAF to activate ERK. Sequence analysis of an additional panel of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine TCCs also revealed a mutation in RanBP2 in 31% of samples. Strikingly, the RanBP2 mutation appeared to be mutually exclusive to BRAF V to E mutant tumors with only two of the analyzed samples carrying both mutations. Significant tumor heterogeneity was implicated due to low level mutant amplification in these samples. It has been reported that loss of RanBP2 is synthetic lethal in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer. Since RanBP2 forms complexes with CRM1 at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear export and at the kinetochore during mitosis, canine TCC cell lines were treated with KPT-185, a CRM1 inhibitor. BRAF mutant TCC cell lines had IC50 values ranging from 45nM to 65nM and were approximately ten-fold more sensitive than wild type cell lines. Overall, this data indicates that the pathogenesis of canine TCC likely depends on driving factors in addition to constitutive BRAF signaling, but Vemurafenib resistant BRAF mutant tumors can be targeted through inhibition of the nucleopore complex.']",

Iodine excess exerts anti-proliferative effects in thyroid cells associated to TGF pathway enhancement, although refractoriness to TGF inhibitory signal is observed in thyroid cancer. We previously showed that high iodine dose protects thyroid cells from BRAF-induced genomic instability and also, delays oncogenic effects of RET/PTC3 oncogene. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate protein levels by pairing to 3-UTR of mRNA and blocking translation. MiR-19 belongs to cluster miR-17-92 which attenuates several tumor-suppressor genes and is predicted to target TGF pathway components. Therefore, we aim to analyze the influence of iodine on microRNA-mediated TGF signaling in BRAFT1799A activated thyroid follicular cells. Methods', ' BRAF9-6 cells, derived from normal rat thyroid follicular cell, which express BRAFT1799A under doxacyclin stimulation were treated with iodine-containing medium at 10-5M (NaI group) for 5 days. Dox treatment was performed for 2 days (Dox-group), in the absence or presence of iodine (Dox+NaI-group). Control was performed without Dox/NaI. MiR-19 expression was performed by real-time qPCR and Smad4 target validation was performed by Western-blotting and luciferase-assay. TGF responsiveness was evaluated by analyzing cell cycle of TGF-treated cells using flow-cytometry. Results', ' BRAFT1799A induction in thyroid cells increased miR-19a and miR-19b levels in 634.3-fold/141.6-fold, respectively (Dox vs Control), while adding iodine prior to BRAFT1799A induction resulted in 2.36-fold/0.66-fold levels (Dox+NaI vs Control). Iodine per se treatment did not change miR-19 levels. BRAFT1799A induction reduced Smad4 protein which was restored by iodine treatment. In parallel to the low Smad4 levels during BRAFT1799A-activation, we observed an impairment of responsiveness to recombinant TGF treatment. Moreover, the iodine-containing medium restored the inhibitory signal and rendered cells arrested in G1-phase. Bioinformatic search for miR-19 potential targets revealed Smad4 as a predicted target which was validated by luciferase-assay that showed reduced luminescence of Smad4 3-UTR plasmid in the presence miR-19.

These TAMs release cytokines as well as other secretory components like exosomes in the tumor microenvironment. Previously, we found that M1 polarized TAMs modulate thyroid cancer phenotype by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), facilitating tissue metastasis and dissemination. In our present study, we used an in vitro model system to assess the crosstalk between the secretory components of macrophages and the epithelial cells in the thyroid tumor microenvironment. We used THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cell line along with thyroid cancer cell lines', ' consisting of two papillary cancer cell lines (BCPAP and TPC-1), one anaplastic cancer cell line (8505C) and one follicular cancer cell line (CGTHW-1). We observed that activated THP-1 macrophages are polarized towards M1 phenotype, secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-, IL6, TNF-, IL-1, amongst others. These cytokines are responsible for halt in proliferation and change in morphology to mesenchymal phenotype promoting EMT in thyroid cancer cells. Similar pattern in phenotypical changes were noted in thyroid cancer cells treated with activated THP-1 macrophage exosomes. We also observed that EMT markers, such as vimentin and NF-B, are modulated in response to activated macrophage secreted exosomes. Moreover, secretory components from anaplastic thyroid cancer cells led to enhanced activation of THP-1 cells. These findings support a mutual cooperation between thyroid cancer cells and inflammatory cells in tumor microenvironment in defining thyroid cancer phenotype. Such correlation can identify early markers and prevent thyroid cancer differentiation, and are putative targets for therapy.']",

The mutant BRAFV600E protein is found in over 50% of melanomas and thyroid carcinomas, resulting in elevated kinase activity, increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling, and cell proliferation. Vemurafenib and PLX4720 were designed to selectively inhibit the BRAF kinase, and clinical trials of vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma have demonstrated a response rate of over 50% and an overall survival advantage over standard dacarbazine therapy. Approximately 20-30% of individuals treated with vemurafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) highlighting the importance of understanding toxicities associated with this drug. Paradoxical ERK activation in BRAF wild-type, RAS-mutant cells is thought to be the major mechanism by which this occurs, as evidenced by the presence of RAS mutations in 60% of such lesions. Methods', '  Using a combination of BRAF-wild-type cSCC cell lines, primary human keratinocytes, as well as a UV mouse model of cSCC and human cSCC samples, we identified novel effects of BRAFi on apoptosis. Results', '  Here we show an unexpected and novel effect of vemurafenib and PLX4720 in suppressing apoptosis through the inhibition of multiple off-target kinases. JNK signaling and apoptosis are suppressed in cSCC lesions arising in vemurafenib-treated patients as well as in irradiated mouse skin. This occurs independently of paradoxical ERK signaling and in the presence of MEK inhibitor. Treatment with PLX4720 greatly accelerates the development of UV-induced cSCC in mice without Ras mutations. Kinome screening identified ZAK and MKK4 (MEK4 / MAP2K4) kinases as inhibited by vemurafenib, leading to suppression of MKK4 and MKK7 (MAP2K7) phosphorylation. Knockdown of inhibited off-target kinases recapitulates these anti-apoptotic effects of vemurafenib. Conclusions', '  Our results implicate suppression of JNK signaling, independent of ERK activation, as an additional, complementary mechanism of adverse effects of vemurafenib.

        "Background":"['Inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is an effective therapeutic strategy against certain types of cancers such as melanoma and thyroid cancer. While demonstrated to be effective anticancer agents, B-Raf inhibitors have also been associated with increased risk of secondary neoplasms. The induction of apoptosis following ligation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with its receptor, death receptor 5 (DR5), offers a potent anticancer strategy. Importantly, this is also a natural immunosurveillance mechanism against cancer cells. We previously demonstrated that activated B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates DR5 expression. Hence, our current work seeks to address whether B-Raf/MEK/ERK inhibition and the consequent suppression of DR5 expression impedes cancer cell response to DR5 activation-induced apoptosis. We found that both B-Raf (e.g., PLX4032) and MEK inhibitors (e.g., AZD6244 and PD0325901) effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reduced DR5 levels in both human thyroid cancer and melanoma cells. Similar to the observed effect of genetic knockdown of the B-Raf gene, pretreatment of cancer cell lines with either B-Raf or MEK inhibitors attenuated or abolished cellular apoptotic response induced by TRAIL or the DR5 agonistic antibody AMG655. Our findings clearly showed that inhibition of the B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling suppresses DR5 expression and impairs DR5 activation-induced apoptosis. These findings warrant further investigation of potential negative impact of B-Raf or MEK inhibition on TRAIL- or DR5-targeted cancer therapy and on TRAIL/DR5-mediated cancer immunosurveillance.(This study was supported by the Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Cancer Scholar award, NIH/NCI SPORE P50 grant CA128613 andWinship Cancer Institute Robbins Scholar award.

Most-frequent AEs across doses were nausea (16%), constipation, dizziness, peripheral edema, and vomiting (all 12%, all Grade 1/2). E6201 was rapidly eliminated (mean t3/4=2.47- 5.60 hr). Exposure to E6201 was dose related and comparable on days 1 and 15. A trend for decreasing IL-6 and IL-8 levels was observed without clear dose dependency or duration of effect.

        "Background":"['Tumor cells reprogram their metabolic pathway to meet their energetic needs during tumor progression. Highly proliferating or transformed cells are able to switch their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation-based energy production to aerobic glycolysis. This switch called Warburg effect is recognized as a bioenergetic signature of cancer cells.The PI3K pathway is one of the most commonly altered signaling in human cancers and plays a primary role in the establishment of the Warburg effect by inducing the transcriptional activation of glycolytic genes, increasing the surface expression of glucose transporters, stimulating lipid synthesis.Using a novel, clinically relevant, mouse model in which thyrocyte-specific deletion of Pten constitutively activates the PI3K signaling cascade, we have identified a previously unrecognized in vivo mechanism through which PI3K activation subverts energy metabolism in thyroid cells by repressing oxidative phosphorylation well before full neoplastic transformation takes place, leading to the coordinated downregulation of the expression of genes encoding for members of both the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.We have now extended our analysis to mice carrying the cancer-associated, constitutively active Pik3caH1047R allele, and have observed the same downregulation of TCA and oxidative phosphorylation genes in the thyroid of Pik3caH1047R heterozygous mice, suggesting that the phenotype observed in the Ptenthyr-/ mice is solely due to the activation of the PI3K pathway.Lactate dehydrogenase is a tetrameric enzyme comprising two major subunits, A and/or B, and catalyzes the forward and backward conversion of pyruvate to lactate.Previous data from our lab showed an increase of lactate levels in thyroids from both young, tumor-free and older Ptenthyr-/ mice, indicating an increase in glycolysis metabolic flux even before full transformation.To test the therapeutic value of Lactate dehydrogenase inhibition both in tumor initiation and in tumor maintenance, we have undertaken a combined pharmacological and genetic approach.Interestingly, our data suggest that pharmaceutical and genetic LDHA inhibition results in a significant reduction in the proliferation rate of different thyroid cancer cell lines.Moreover, to test the hypothesis that the glycolytic switch is necessary for full neoplastic transformation of Pten/ thyroids and to prove that the LDHA enzyme plays a crucial rule in this process, we have generated a new (Pten,Ldha)thyr-/ mouse model that is being currently phenotypically and molecularly characterized to assess the effect of Ldha deficiency on thyroid hyperplasia, proliferation index, lactate content, and TCA cycle/OXPHOS gene expression.Taken together, these data pave the way to the full understanding of the metabolic landscape induced by the activation of the PI3K pathway, and to the possibility of exploring therapeutic approaches targeting metabolic deregulation in vivo.']",

RP3 has an active inflammatory component leading to the secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, however the role of inflammation in development and progression of PTC has not been clearly defined. Facilitating investigation of this issue is our finding that the transforming and inflammatory signals of RP3 can be functionally separated allowing us to study each in isolation. We generated several RP3 mutants ablated in; 1) transformative signaling due to mutation of a tyrosine residue (RP3Y588Fmutant) which prevents the binding of downstream adaptor proteins 2) inflammatory signaling through mutation of binding sites for TRAF2 and TRAF6. Transformation only RP3 mutants grew tumors in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, strengthening our hypothesis that the inflammatory component of RP3 is responsible for the benign nature of PTC.To assess the impact of inflammatory RP3 on the progression of different tumors, various thyroid and non-thyroid tumorigenic cell lines were transduced with MSCV_IRES_GFP_RP3 mutants and sorted for GFP expression. With highly immunogenic MC57G cells (C57BL/6 mice), the transforming only mutants developed tumors whereas wild type RP3 along with inflammatory only RP3 were rejected. Inflammation only RP3 mutant also led to slower tumor growth in Renca cell line (Balb/c) demonstrating the effect to be independent of haplotype. We are currently extending the analysis to PTC lines with BRAF and KRAS mutations, which are usually associated with more aggressive tumor profiles without an inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Our data so far suggest that contrary to the contemporary view, inflammation can retard tumor progression. Thus, the RP3 oncogene might be exploited in this regard. Future experiments aim to further characterize the importance of RP3-driven inflammation in tumor growth through continued in vivo and in vitro studies.']",

        "Background":"['B-Raf inhibitors have been used for the treatment of some B-Raf-mutated cancers such as melanoma and thyroid cancer. They effectively inhibit B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling in cancers harboring mutant B-Raf, but lead to a paradoxical activation of MEK/ERK signaling in Ras-mutant cancers. Death receptor 5 (DR5), a cell surface pro-apoptotic protein, triggers apoptosis upon ligation with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or aggregation. Given the critical role of MEK/ERK signaling in the positive regulation of DR5 expression as we have previously demonstrated, this study focuses on determining the impact of B-Raf inhibition on DR5 expression and DR5 activation-induced apoptosis in Ras-mutant cancer cells. Using chemical and genetic approaches, we have demonstrated that the B-Raf inhibitor PLX4032 induces DR5 upregulation exclusively in Ras-mutant cancer cells; this effect is dependent on Ras/c-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling activation. PLX4032 induces DR5 expression at transcriptional levels, largely due to enhancing CHOP/Elk1-mediated DR5 transcription. Pre-treatment of Ras-mutated cancer cells with PLX4032 sensitizes them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis; this is also a c-Raf/MEK/ERK-dependent event. Collectively our findings highlight a previously undiscovered effect of B-Raf inhibition on the induction of DR5 expression and the enhancement of DR5 activation-induced apoptosis in Ras-mutant cancer cells. Our results may suggest a novel therapeutic strategy against Ras-mutated cancer cells by driving their death due to DR5-dependent apoptosis through B-Raf inhibition.

Here we used patient-derived (PDX) tumor models to explore the potential involvement of RET fusions, and the efficacy of ponatinib, in other cancers.Results', ' To identify potential RET fusion-positive PDX tumor models, we examined RET mRNA levels in 273 PDX tumors (Crown Bioscience) from various cancer types, looking for models with outlier RET expression. To search for RET fusions, we performed RNAseq on 4 tumors that had the highest RET levels. Interestingly, RET fusions were detected in tumors from 2 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (pts) and not in tumors from 2 NSCLC pts that expressed similar levels of RET. The fusions detected in CRC pts, NCOA4-RET and CCDC6-RET, had previously been observed in NSCLC pts. Both CRC tumors were negative for other major hotspot mutations, including KRAS, BRAF and PI3K, suggesting that these RET-fusions might be primary oncogenic drivers in these tumors. To evaluate the cellular activity of ponatinib, we generated cell lines that were dependent on the activity of these fusions. Ponatinib potently inhibited the viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing NCOA4-RET and CCD6-RET with IC50s of 6 and 22 nM, respectively. Consistent with these effects being due to inhibition of RET, ponatinib inhibited RET phosphorylation with similar potency. Other TKIs with RET activity, vandetanib (IC50s', ' 564-1000 nM), cabozantinib (60-386 nM), sunitinib (277-584 nM), sorafenib (105-494 nM), and lenvatinib (68-257 nM), also inhibited viability of the Ba/F3 lines, but with potencies substantially reduced compared to ponatinib. Finally, we examined the efficacy of ponatinib in the RET fusion positive PDX colorectal models, compared to 2 RET fusion negative colorectal models. In the RET-negative models, daily oral dosing of ponatinib (20 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth by 24-41%. In contrast, ponatinib exhibited much greater efficacy in the RET-fusion positive models, inhibiting tumor growth by 79% in the NCOA4-RET model and inducing near complete regression in the CCDC6-RET model.Conclusion', ' We identified, for the first time, oncogenic RET fusions in CRC patient samples, suggesting RET may be a driver in a subset of CRC patients.

We compared our results with listed detectable mutations in the FDA-approval labeling for EGFR, KRAS and BRAF for cobas tests (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and Therascreen tests (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Results', ' We detected 55 unique EGFR mutations in 99 patients. Of all 99 patients with EGFR mutations, 39 patients (39%) had mutations in codons not covered in the commercial cobas v2 kit and 63 (64%) were not covered by the older cobas v1 kit. Therascreen test also did not cover 64 (65%) mutations detected in EGFR. We detected mutations in BRAF in 114 patients, but only 61 patients had mutations involving codon V600 and 53 (46.5%) patients had mutations involving other codons. These mutations would have been missed if tested using FDA-cleared tests. We detected mutations in KRAS in 320 patients, of which 284 mutations (89%) involved codons 12 and 13. Sixteen (5%) mutations involved codon 61 and 20 (6%) mutations involved other codons. Therefore 6% of patients with KRAS mutation would have been missed if the cobas KRAS test (P = 0.00002) is used and 11% if Therascreen is used.

Translocations involving the NTRK1/2/3 kinase domain, mutations involving the TRK ligand-binding site, and amplifications of NTRK, have been described in diverse tumor types and may contribute to tumorigenesis. A broad range of pediatric malignancies have been found to harbor NTRK fusions, including infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS), spindle-cell sarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, pediatric papillary thyroid cancer, pediatric gliomas and Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Larotrectinib is the first small-molecule selective inhibitor of TRKA, -B, and -C in clinical development and preliminary data from the adult phase 1 trial demonstrate prolonged responses in patients with TRK fusions and a favorable safety profile. Methods', ' We have initiated an open-label, multi-center, international Phase 1/2 study with larotrectinib in pediatric patients with solid tumors and primary CNS tumors (NCT02637687). Patients with advanced cancer between the ages of 1 year and 21 years are eligible, as well as patients as young as 1-month of age with a documented NTRK fusion. Patients with IFS who have not had definitive surgery are also eligible. Larotrectinib is administered orally twice daily on a continuous 28-day schedule. Dosing is based on body surface area. Larotrectinib is available in an oral liquid formulation and capsules. Following identification of the maximum tolerated dose of larotrectinib in the phase 1 portion, the phase 2 portion will commence. The phase 2 portion will enroll patients with NTRK-translocated tumors and measurable disease into three cohorts', ' 1) infantile fibrosarcoma; 2) extracranial solid tumors; and 3) primary CNS tumors. The primary endpoint for the phase 2 portion is objective response rate, with duration of response and progression free survival as secondary efficacy endpoints.

To evaluate the role of TERTp mutations on metastatic tumor expansion, primary tumors (Pt) and matched LNMs and/or DMs were genotyped by means of PCR-direct sequencing in a cohort of 33 patients diagnosed of PTC, which had been previously analyzed for BRAF and RAS mutations. Focal changes in the growth pattern or microscopic grade within the Pt or the metastases were separately genotyped to determine the clonal/subclonal nature of TERTp mutations, their association with particular histological variants of PTC or their presence in intra-tumoral PDC-like foci. Results were correlated with clinico-pathological parameters of pour outcome and survival. The analysis of 99 tumor samples obtained from 33 PTC cases revealed that TERTp mutations were quite common (42.4%).The mutation C228T was much more common than the C250T (78,6% vs 21,4%). TERTp mutations did not correlate with specific PTC subtypes [CL-PTC, FV-PTC or Mixed-PTC] and were subclonal in half of the cases. The mutations segregated to LNMs in 73% of cases [100% CL-PTC and FV-PTC; 57% Mixed PTC]. In 2 Mixed-PTC cases the mutation seemingly originated the novo in the LNM. TERTp mutations were present in all samples of DM. While 71% of the cases mutated at TERTp bore the BRAFV600E mutation, the coexistence of TERTp and RAS mutations was exceptional. TERTp mutations were found to be significantly correlated with age ≥ 45 years old, high grade poorly differentiated PTC foci or nesting-PDC-like foci, stage at diagnosis or at last follow-up and patient status. A trend of correlation with male sex, vascular invasion, tumor recurrence and development of LNM during the follow-up was also seen. Tumor multifocality was inversely correlated with TERTp mutations. The coexistence of TERTp and BRAFV600E mutants did not increase the prognostic power of TERTp mutations alone. All of the patients who died of disease displayed TERTp mutations. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with PTC bearing TERTp mutations had a poor prognosis showing a higher tumor recurrence probability [p= 0.0085] and a reduced disease specific survival [p<0.0001].

In addition, patients initially responding develop acquired resistance to VEGFR inhibitors after varying periods of time. Thus it is urgent to develop strategy to overcome anti-VEGF therapy resistance. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met signaling is activated in various types of tumors. Recently, it is reported that HGF/Met signaling contributes to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as EGFR, BRAF, ALK inhibitors. This suggests that Met inhibitors may be promising in treating HGF/Met activated anti-VEGF therapy-resistant tumors. We have identified lenvatinib (E7080) as a highly-potent VEGFR inhibitor and phase III trial is ongoing in thyroid cancer. Lenvatinib inhibited the growth of HUVEC induced by VEGF, however, addition of HGF to HUVEC conferred resistance to lenvatinib. This resistance was cancelled by the addition of golvatinib (E7050) which is identified as a potent Met/EphB4 inhibitor and phase I trial of the lenvatinib/golvatinib combination therapy is ongoing. In mouse models bearing various tumor cell lines expressing VEGF and HGF, treatment with lenvatinib alone demonstrated only moderate antitumor activity, however, combination with golvatinib demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity with decrease of tumor vessel density. Furthermore, it is reported that EphB4 has critical roles in tumor vessel development and maturation. Our unique in vitro assay systems, endothelial cells/pericyte 2D co-culture assay and endothelial cells/pericyte 3D co-culture sprouting assay, suggested that EphB4 inhibitory activity of golvatinib disrupted anti-VEGF therapy-resistant tumor vascular in the combination with lenvatinib.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) is an inhibitory ligand of the Notch receptor family. It is highly expressed in high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell NEC (LCNEC), but is not expressed in normal tissue. DLL3 is expressed in melanoma, glioblastoma (GBM), neuroendocrine prostate, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), and other solid cancers. Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting DLL3, composed of a DLL3-specific IgG1 monoclonal antibody joined to a toxic DNA cross-linking agent by a cleavable linker. Rova-T binds to DLL3 on target-expressing cells, is internalized and cleaved, releasing the toxin to induce cell death. A Phase 1 study of Rova-T in SCLC showed encouraging antitumor activity in DLL3-high patients (pts), and was well-tolerated (Rudin et al., Lancet Oncol, 2016). As novel therapies are needed for multiple cancers that express DLL3, Rova-T may be effective in these tumors. Methods', ' This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study (NCT02709889) with 8 cohorts of pts (up to ~318 total, 14 pts enrolled as of 20 January 2017) with melanoma, MTC, GBM, LCNEC, neuroendocrine prostate cancer, gastroenteropancreatic NEC, other NEC, or other solid tumor. In Part A, a 3+3 dose escalation will be used. Rova-T 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 mg/kg will be given on Day 1 of each 42-day cycle. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed over a 21-day period. Dose escalation will proceed within cohort until a maximum tolerated dose is reached. Part B expansion, Stage 1, will explore the recommended dose in 7 pts in disease specific cohorts. Stage 2 will use an adaptive 2-stage design to determine sample size.

As of the end of 2009, more than 800 patients were enrolled in the PCMR, including cases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC, n = 199), endometrioid carcinoma (EC, n = 95), thyroid carcinoma (TC, n = 276), bladder carcinoma (n = 80), and malignant melanoma (MM, n = 163 ). Tumor DNA from archival tissue was genotyped using a Sequenom MassArray system. Each sample was analyzed using a panel (320 assays) that detects known mutations in 29 genes. Clinical and genotyping data are stored in a web-interfaced, customized SQL database. Results', ' 95% of approached patients consented to registry enrollment. Archival tumor suitable for analysis was obtained in 95% of cases. Mutations in EC include PIK3CA (21%), CTNNB1 (13%), KRAS (11%), FBXW7 (5%), TP53 (5%), AKT1 (4%), FGFR2 (3%), NRAS (1%) and PDGFRA (1%); 14 cases harbor 2 or more mutations. Among cutaneous MM we found mutations in BRAF (47%; 10.8% other than V600E), NRAS (13%), CTNNB1 (3%), PIK3CA (2%), AKT1 (1%) and MEK2 (1%). In CRC we found mutations in KRAS (30%), TP53 (16%), PIK3CA (12%), NRAS / BRAF / FBXW7 (3% each), CTNNB1 (2%), and MEK1 / AKT1 / AKT2 / RET (1% each). Remarkably, 10 of 14 CRC tumors (71%) with a PIK3CA mutation also have a KRAS mutation. In TC, we found mutations of BRAF (63%), RET-PTC (7%), and PIK3CA/KRAS/NRAS/HRAS (1.5% each). Conclusions', ' Prospective tumor genotyping for PCMR patients reveals a remarkable diversity of potentially druggable mutations, knowledge of which will help in clinical trial enrollment. While rare in the examined tumors, mutations in FGFR2, MEK1/2, AKT1/2, PDGFRA and RET could be targeted as part of individualized cancer treatments. In CRC, the common overlap of PIK3CA mutations with KRAS mutations may negatively impact response to inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway.']",

        "Background":"[\"The growing trend to make cancer treatment more precise depends on the accurate identification of clinically actionable genomic alterations within a patient's tumor. Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gene fusions exist across a multitude of tumor types and that known fusions are not always confined to the disease in which they appear most often. These rearrangements include clinically actionable fusions which may identify tumors that are sensitive to selective FDA-approved targeted agents.\"]",

Methods', '  A total of 74 intensively pretreated MTC pts (OC, n = 65; FTC, n = 2; EC-II, n = 4; PPSC, n = 3) were included in this study with 43 (58.1%) being platinum-resistant.

Tx included Bev monotherapy (group A, n = 17), Bev + metronomic CTx (group B, n = 37), and Bev + conventionally dosed CTx (Group C, n=20). Bev was administered at either 10 mg/kg BW q2w or 15 mg/kg BW q3w. Adverse effects were classified according to CTCAE Vs 4.03. TTP was calculated from the start of Bev until progression, OS was calculated from the start of Bev until death or loss to follow up. Results', '  Most common Tx related toxicities were hypertension, proteinuria, headache, inflammation/infection, epistaxis, and subileus. Hypertension which often required adequate treatment was limiting in only one case as also were renal toxicity and infection. Median TTP was 27.8 wks and median OS was 53.6 wks with no significant difference between platinum-resistant and sensitive pts.

Conclusions', '  Bev based Tx was active and generally well tolerated in this hard-to-treat population of pts with recurrent MTC. Both TTP and OS were equal or even superior to any conventional CTx used in this setting. Moreover, clinical platinum-resistance did not predict a worse clinical outcome. Although this is not a randomized trial, our results argue in favor that Bev should be preferably given either as single agent or combined with metronomic CTx in pts with heavily pretreated MTCs.

In this study we aimed to analyze the expression of HAGE in large well-characterized BC cohorts to determine its relationship with other clinico-pathological parameters and to investigate its prognostic value.  Methods', '    HAGE protein expression was assessed in', ' a) 40 normal breast tissue (NBT), b) 60 invasive BCs and their matching NBT, c) BC cell lines, d) A series of 1650 consecutive cases of primary BC who treated with adjuvant CMF and/or endocrine therapies.  Further validation was performed in 2 independent series of high risk ER- BC', ' a) 300 ER BC who did not received any CT and b) 396 ER- BC treated with adjuvant anthracycline (ATC) based CT.  Results', '    The NBT showed negative HAGE expression (HAGE-) throughout.  HAGE overexpression (HAGE+) was observed in 10% of BC and was significantly associated with aggressive clinico-pathological features including', ' ER-, high grade and triple negative phenotypes.  Moreover, HAGE+ expression showed an adverse outcome with a 2-4 fold increase in the risk of death, recurrence and metastases (ps<0.00001) compared to HAGE-; ps<0.0001.  Using a multivariate Cox regression model including ER status, grade, size and tumour stage, HAGE expression was confirmed as a powerful independent prognostic factor (p<0.0001). The poor clinical outcome of HAGE+ was further confirmed in high risk (NPI>3.4) ER- patients who did not received any CT (p<0.0001).  While, adjuvant CT either CMF or ATC had a positive impact on HAGE+/high risk ER- BC as HAGE+ had a similar risk of death, recurrence and distant metastases to HAGE- expression.  Conclusions', '    This is the first report which shows HAGE to be a potential predictor for poor prognosis in BC patients, and may be an attractive novel target for molecular and vaccine therapy for those patients.  A prospective trial of adjuvant chemotherapy/vaccine to confirm this finding is warranted.']",

The HSA is an in vitro assay that enables one to take a viable sample of an individual patient's tumor, make a single cell suspension, mix it in known proportions with human fibroblasts (AG1522) and dispense a known number of cells of the mixture into each well of Ultra Low Attachment (ULA) 96-well plates to agglomerate into 1 HS/well, each containing an average of <1 CSC. The HS provides an analog of the CSC niche, enabling the CSC to proliferate (with some daughters differentiating into Amplifying Transit Cells (ATCs)) and undergo 10-15 symmetric divisions before exhausting the nutrients.

        "Background":"['With the advent of immune therapies including inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis there is an urgent need to identify cancer patients that benefit from these therapies and to overcome mechanisms of resistance. Here, we analyzed the impact of tumor genetics on the composition of tumor microenvironment across 21 solid cancer types from the TCGA project. Using specific mRNA markers of 10 cell populations (MCPcounter), we estimated the content of T cells, CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, B lineage cells, NK cells, monocytic lineage cells, myeloid dendritic cells, neutrophils, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in tumor tissues. Immune cell compositions were correlated with mutational load, the activity of 27 mutational signatures (MutSigs) and PD-L1 mRNA expression. Correlation strength was assessed using Spearman’s rho statistics. Multiple testing was addressed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and FDR control at 5%. MutSig 1 (clock-like, age-related) showed significant positive correlations with immune cell infiltrations in low-grade gliomas, negative correlations in breast cancer, melanoma, stomach cancer, lung and prostate adenocarcinoma, but no significant correlations in the remaining 15 cancer types. Of the two APOBEC-related signatures, MutSig 2 showed positive significant correlations with immune cell infiltrates in cervical cancer, bladder cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, head and neck cancer and thyroid cancer, MutSig 13 in breast and cervical cancer. In particular, correlation of MutSig 2 with cytotoxic lymphocytes was significant in cervical cancer, bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (R = 0.29, R= 0.17 and R = 0.17), the corresponding correlation of MutSig 13 in breast cancer (R = 0.17). MutSig 4 (tobacco smoke-related) showed a positive significant correlation with CD8+ T cells and NK cells in lung adenocarcinoma (R = 0.15 and R = 0.14). In contrast, correlation of MutSig 4 with immune cell infiltrates was non-significant or negative in head and neck cancer. In colorectal cancer, MutSig 6 (defective mismatch repair) showed significant positive correlations with NK cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, monocytic lineage cells and neutrophils infiltration (R = 0.45, R = 0.37, R = 0.23 and R = 0.19). PD-L1 mRNA expression and immune cell infiltrates correlated positively in all 21 cancer types. In particular, correlation with monocytic lineage cells was positive and significant in all cancer types and strong (R > 0.50) in 12 cancer types. Correlation with T cells was positive and significant in 18 cancer types and strong in 10 cancer types. In summary, pan-cancer analysis of DNA and RNAseq data showed that specific mutational signatures contribute to cancer cell immunogenicity, while the ubiquitous clock-like mutational process did not positively correlate with immune cell infiltrates in 20 of 21 cancer types. Moreover, PD-L1 mRNA expression strongly correlated with infiltrates of immune cells in the majority of cancer types.']",

Conclusions', ' There are major variations in the spending on cancer drugs between countries in the study. Japan has a high spending on cancer drugs in relation to burden of disease, and this spending is especially high on \"mature\" drugs.

        "Meeting_name":" Estimating the fraction of a tumor that is killed by a drug.",
        "Background":"['We analysed mathematically the progress of thousands of patients enrolled in clinical trials with diagnoses of prostate, renal cell, breast, and thyroid carcinomas and multiple myeloma, treated with cytotoxic and targeted drugs, tumor quantity being measured radiologically or by serum markers (see, e.g., Stein et al Clin Cancer Res. 2011,17, 907-17, for prostate cancer). Treatment often results in reduction of tumor quantity, with subsequent regrowth. In some regression does not occur; in others regrowth is not recorded. All these outcomes are described by a simple mathematical formula (see Eq. (1) below) that describes progress of treatment, yielding the rate of tumor decay, d, and rate of regrowth, g. When regrowth is not seen, g is indistinguishable from zero, as is d if tumor quantity fails to decrease. Parameter g is a surrogate measure of overall survival. Median g values can be used to compare the arms of a clinical trial.In a minority of cases, increase in tumor quantity is delayed for an extended period of time before regrowth occurs, and the simple formula must be modified to include an additional parameter, , the fraction of tumor killed by the drug, see Eq. (2). In a trial of 750 multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated with liposomal doxorubicin plus bortezomib (PLD + B) or bortezomib (B) alone, 114 cases were better fitted by Eq. (2) than by Eq. (1). For these, the median value of  was 0.99, meaning that 99% of the tumor was destroyed by drug, only 1% being left to regrow. Were this 1% of tumor to regrow at rate 0.0131 per day (the median for these 114 patients) it would return to the initial tumor quantity, expanding 100-fold, in ln(100)/0.0131 days or 11.5 months. The OS for these patients who died before the study closed was 12.7 (8.9 to 16) months, close to the predicted. If  is less than 0.85, and g is larger than 0.02 per day, the predictions of Eqs. 1 and 2 are similar. Slight scatter in the data will not allow a distinction to be made between the models, nor a definitive value of  estimated. Nevertheless, aggregating data from numerous patients enables  to be estimated for such a data set. Aggregating the data for the 388 MM patients for whom g and/or d but not  could be established,  was 0.84 for the PLD + B arm and 0.79 for B. To regrow to the initial tumor quantity requires 2.7 doublings for the PLD + B arm and 2.2 for B, a difference that would result in only a trivial increase in OS. However, the difference between the computed tumor growth rates, 0.0019 and 0.0037 for the PLD + B arm and B respectively, would be expected to lead to a noticeable increase in OS were treatment to continue beyond conventional endpoints.Measuring the fraction of tumor killed by a drug, and the rate of growth recovery, can give insight into drug/tumor interactions and guide development of new therapies.Equation 1', ' f(t) = exp (-d  t) + exp (g  t) -1, exp is the base of the natural logarithms, and f(t) the tumor measurement at time t, normalized to the tumor measurement at day 0;Equation 2', ' f(t) =   exp (-d  t) + (1-)  exp (g  t)]']",
