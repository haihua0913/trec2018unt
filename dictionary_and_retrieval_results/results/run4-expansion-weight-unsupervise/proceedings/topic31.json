        "Background":"['Concurrent inactivation of the p16Ink4a and p53 tumor suppressors, often through mutation of CDKN2A and TP53, is frequent in early development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers. The role of this early combined inactivation, and the oncogenic drivers that subsequently lead to tumor development, are poorly defined. To characterize the precancerous role of concurrently mutated CDKN2A and TP53, we combined a number of recent advances to disrupt both loci in primary cells. First, we grew primary keratinocytes in medium conditioned by irradiated J2-3T3 cells and containing an inhibitor of ROCK kinases, conditions that greatly extend their normally limited proliferative potential. Second, we transfected primary keratinocytes with plasmid vectors expressing both Cas9 and sets of guide RNAs targeting specific regions of CDKN2A and TP53. We targeted either or both of the p14Arf and p16Ink4a protein products of CDKN2A for knockout (KO), together with either TP53 KO or a TP53 point mutation (R248Q protein product), two major categories of genetic alterations of p53 in HNSCC. Third, we evaluated use of nutlin-3, an inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction, to try to select against cells that still contained wild-type p53. We assessed KO efficiency by PCR of genomic DNA; the TP53 point mutation introduced a SauA3i site into TP53. Two weeks of nutlin-3 treatment led to a 3 fold increase in p53 KO efficiency versus untreated cells (50% versus 14%). p16Ink4a KO efficiencies were enhanced 2 to 14 fold after nutlin-3 treatment, depending on the specific Cas9/guide-RNA constructs used. In cells transfected to produce p53 R248Q, 14% of PCR products amplifying the mutated region after nutlin-3 exposure showed Sau3Ai digestion, whereas no Sau3Ai digestion was detected in untreated cells. This result suggests that up to 14% of nutlin-3 treated keratinocytes had integrated the mutated donor oligo sequence. We similarly enrich for mutated keratinocytes having p14Arf-specific or combined CDKN2A KO along with TP53 KO or mutation. Combined transfection to generate concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations under conditions that allow extended proliferation in culture, followed by selection for successful TP53 mutation with nutlin-3, will facilitate identification of keratinocyte clones with bi-allelic knockout genotypes. This panel of keratinocytes with concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations will help delineate the roles of these genes in early cancer development and will allow screening for the oncogenic drivers required for tumor development and metastasis, with emphasis on discovering more effective and specific druggable targets for improving treatment.']",

Currently there is no general guidance on the most appropriate biomarkers for clinical assessment of HPV. We measured DNA-based and serological markers in a single population-based study to assess their associations with disease outcome and to determine the most relevant biomarker for clinical use. HPV16 serology was determined using an immunoassay for the capsid protein L1, and multiplex serology based on the capsid protein L1 and the early oncoproteins E6/E7 for 488 patients. Immunohistochemical detection of p16 expression in tumors was performed in a subset of 233 cases, and we used two different methods to assess the presence of HPV16 DNA in a subset of 179 cases tumors. Seropositivity for the E6 and E7 proteins (individually) was significantly associated with enhanced survival (HRE6 or HRE7=0.3, 95%CI=0.2-0.5). Neither the presence of HPV16 DNA or p16 overexpression was associated with significant enhanced overall survival (HRDNA=0.8, 95%CI=0.5-1.3; HRp16=0.8, 95%CI=0.5-1.4). However the combination of HPV positive DNA and E6/E7 serology was associated with similarly enhanced overall survival (HRDNA+/E6+/E7+=0.1, 95%CI=0.01-0.6), while E6/E7 seronegative patients with evidence of HPV in tumor DNA did not show any evidence of favorable survival (HRDNA+/E6-/E7-=1.2, 95%CI = 0.7-2.2). Further, the combination of p16 staining and early gene seropositivity showed a favorable survival (HRp16+/E6+/E7+=0.3, 95%CI=0.1-0.9), while those who were p16 positive and early gene seronegative had significantly increased hazard of death (HRp16+/E6-/E7-=2.1, 95%CI=1.1-4.2). Determination of only HPV16 DNA status or p16 immunostaining is not an effective prognostic biomarker for HNSCC.

To better utilize this valuable resource, we performed its first genome-wide characterization by investigating 12 canine HNSCC cases, of which 9 are oral, via high density array comparative genomic hybridization and RNA-seq. The analyses reveal that these canine cancers faithfully recapitulate many key molecular features of human HNSCC. These include similar genomic copy number abnormality landscapes, analogous sequence mutation patterns, and recurrent alteration of known HNSCC genes (e.g., MYC, CDKN2A) and pathways (e.g., cell cycle, mitogenic signaling, TGF signaling). Amplification or overexpression of protein kinase genes, matrix metalloproteinase genes, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes TWIST1 and SNAI are also prominent in these canine tumors.The strong dog-human molecular homology fundamentally justifies the use of our novel dog-human comparison strategy for driver-passenger discrimination for HNSCC. This cross-species comparison will significantly advance beyond the current findings with the massive genomic data of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), as exemplified by our pilot study on human 8q, a recurrently amplified site in human HNSCC.HNSCC represents the sixth leading cancer by incidence in humans; thus developing effective therapeutic interventions is important. While our understanding of the biology of HNSCC has been greatly advanced over past decades, translating these findings into clinical success has been frustratingly slow.

Etiologic risk factors for HNSCC include tobacco and alcohol use and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Epidemiologically, HPV(+) tumors appreciate a prognostic advantage and have a distinct risk profile compared to HPV(-) HNSCCs. HPV(+) HNSCCs also have a different molecular profile than HPV(-) HNSCCs, specifically a higher somatic mutation rate among HPV(-) tumors and a higher degree of epigenetic modifications among HPV(+) tumors. Although disparities in epigenetic modifications by race have been described for breast, liver and colon cancer, these changes are not well understood among HNSCCs. Here, we described epigenetic modification of candidate genes affecting HNSCC carcinogenesis to understand potential molecular differences in tumor phenotype that may be associated with a distinct racial risk profile in HNSCC patients. We identified formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HNSCC tissue blocks archived by the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium Biospecimen Repository for Caucasian and African American patients. Information on site, sex and age was also available. DNA was extracted from tissue collected from areas of >70% cellularity.

Invasion of tumor cells into lymph nodes is one of the characters of regional metastasis and DNA hypermethylation is characterized in all types of human cancers. We therefore assessed whether epigenetic modification of DNA methylation is correlated to HNSCC metastasis, and evaluated the potential clinical implications of DNA methylation-based biomarker. Methylation array (Illumina infinium beadsarray) was applied to profile aberrant methylated CpG loci in HNSCC with lymph node invasiveness. Fourteen HNSCC tumors and two normal oral tissues were included.  value, the indicator of methylation status of each tested CpG locus, was derived with normalization. A cluster of 111 CpG loci was selected based on the difference between the mean  value of HNSCC tumors with and without regional metastasis (metz minus non-metz  0.2 or  0.2). Hierarchical diagram revealed distinct methylation signature was observed between tumors with or without regional metastasis. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed that the major diseases associated were neurological disorder and endocrine system disorder; and the top canonical pathway was Huntington's disease signaling. Of the top aberrant hypermethylated alleles, p16 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were selected for further investigation on clinical implication. The methylation status of p16 (n=107) and BDNF (n=88) in HNSCC tumors was assayed by methylation-specific PCR. The primer sequences of both alleles were adopted from published report. Statistic analysis (t-test, 2 or Fisher's exact, logistic regress, Kaplan-Meier survival, and Cox regression) was performed using SPSS. Hypermethylation of p16 or BDNF were not associated with stage, metastasis at diagnosis, and differentiation.

However, hypermethylation of BDNF was associated with distant metastasis of follow-up (odds ratio\", ' 4.96, 95% CI', ' 1.28-18.87, p=0.002), and combination with p16 improved the prediction (odds ratio', ' 10.31, 95% CI', ' 1.68-62.5, p=0.012).

        "Background":"['Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide and has not seen an improvement in survival in decades. Current standard-of-care treatments including surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation still lead to high rates of recurrence and loco-regional metastasis contributing to the poor prognosis in these patients. It is well established that HNSCC are highly immune-modulatory tumors and may therefore benefit from immunotherapy treatment regimens. Better methods are therefore needed to match patients with the appropriate immunotherapy. Recently, human papillomavirus (HPV) was implicated in the etiology of a subset of HNSCC arising in younger patients without a history of alcohol and tobacco use. Approximately 30% of HNSCC tumors are HPV+ and despite late stage presentation, often have a better prognosis and response to therapy. This study examines how host immune recognition and response varies between HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC, with the goal of identifying new targets for immunotherapy. The immune profile and HPV infection status of 41 HNSCC patient tumor samples obtained from surgical resection was characterized by qRT-PCR, PCR, and IHC techniques. Tumor samples were analyzed for the expression of 40 genes involved in immune activation and suppression in the tumor microenvironment to generate an immune profile. Gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and compared across HPV+, HPV- and normal tissue groups by ANOVA and post-test pairwise analysis. HPV infectivity of tumor biopsies was determined using HPV consensus primers (MY09/MY11 and GP5+/GP6+) and confirmed with p16 immunohistochemistry. From these studies, eight of 41 (20%) HNSCC biopsies were HPV+ by PCR and IHC analysis. HPV+ tumors demonstrated statistically significant increased expression of genes related to immunosuppression including regulatory T (CD4, FoxP3, CTLA-4, and FasL) and myeloid suppressor cell markers (CD11b and IL-6, an inducer of these suppressor cells), as well as negative-regulators (SOCS1) (p<0.05). These tumors also demonstrated an increase in markers of immune activation and infiltration, including evidence of T cells (CD4, Fas-L), antigen presenting cells (CD80, CD83, CD1c), and inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules (IL-2, IL-12, IFN- , and OX40L) (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in gene expression found between normal tissue and HPV- HNSCC tumors. These studies demonstrate a general pattern of increased immunogenicity and concurrent immunosuppression in patients with HPV+ versus HPV- HNSCC that could potentially be used to inform immunotherapy treatment of HNSCC patients. HPV+ tumors may be more effectively treated with a regimen that employs a combination of immune stimulation and reversal of immune tolerance mechanisms, while HPV- tumors may require greater immune stimulation to activate endogenous anti-tumor immune responses.']",

Thus, we chose to investigate miR-205 as a putative HNSCC oncogene and regulator of E2F1 protein expression.Methods', ' miRNAs were isolated from 29 newly diagnosed HNSCC tumors (HPV-positive', ' 14, HPV-negative', ' 15) and 4 normal mucosa samples using the PureLink RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). miRNA was analyzed using the ABI Megaplex protocol without pre-amplification (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were run using the miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and Megaplex RT Human Pool A primers, then analyzed by TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) cards. miRNA data was normalized to MammU6 expression, with undetectable transcripts assigned a Ct value of 40. Empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics were used to assess miRNA differential expression and the Benjamini-Hotchberg correction was applied to these p-values to account for multiple hypothesis testing. miR-205 expression was then transiently modified (Dharmacon) in an HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cell line. These cells were characterized by Western blot and assayed for changes in proliferation utilizing two- and three-dimensional growth assays.Results', ' HNSCC miRNA expression was characterized by a general upregulation of individual transcripts and miRNA families compared to normal mucosa. This difference in expression was independent of HPV-status, with only two miRNAs demonstrating differential expression between HPV-positive and -negative tumors', ' miR-449a and miR-129-3p. miR-205, a transcript upregulated in both subtypes, was able to modulate proliferation and E2F1 expression levels in 93VU147T (HPV+), but not UM-SCC-15 (HPV-). Further Western blot analysis concluded modulations in Rb-phosphorylation status and apoptotic signaling factors may explain these E2F1-mediated effects. Conclusions', ' While significant differences are evident in the miRNA profiles of HNSCC compared to normal mucosa, a striking degree of similarity exists between HPV-positive and -negative miRNA deregulation. A functional evaluation of miR-205 determined this transcript is capable of modulating HNSCC growth in the genetic context of p16 expression and proapoptotic signaling.']",

We assessed p16/CDKN2A expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), promoter methylation status by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, mutation status by Sanger sequencing, gene copy number variation by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and correlated each of these with patient outcome.Results. The majority of OTSCC demonstrated loss of p16 expression (107/118, 90.7%), assessed by IHC. The frequency of CDKN2A inactivating mutations was 20.3% (21/103), homozygous CDKN2A loss was 4.1% (7/98), hemizygous CDKN2A loss 30.6% (30/98), and CDKN2A promoter methylation >10% was 17.7% (20/113). 34/107(31.8%) p16 IHC negative tumours had no evidence of CDKN2A mutation, copy number variation or promoter methylation identified. Of eleven p16 IHC positive patients, only two demonstrated evidence of HPV type 16 and 33 on PCR. No correlation was identified between any of the mechanisms of CDKN2A inactivation and clinicopathological features.

Western blotting was also used to test signal change by treatments. TW2.6 had already been proved to possess defective p53, p16 loss, and increased Bcl2.Results', 'In our previous study, TW2.6 was resistant to chemotherapy, radiation, EGFR inhibitors, and ani-angiogenesis treamtents, such as axitinib and sunitinib.

Invasion capacity of all HNSCC cell lines were all blocked by the three drugs but regorafenib did mostly well. However, axitinib had no effect on TW2.6; but nintedanb and regorafenib had moderate response on TW2.6.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of ERCC1expression with p16 and Ki-67 as predictive markers in the response to platin-based induction chemotherapy and as prognostic markers in patients with HNSCC.  Methods', '    208 patients treated from 2000 to 2006 by an induction chemotherapy regimen for HNSCC were included retrospectively. ERCC1 (8F1 and FL297 clone), p16 and Ki-67 staining were performed on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue collected before chemotherapy.

Results', '    Respectively, 68% (142/208 patients) and 81.5% (163/200 patients) of HNSCC showed low expression of 8F1 and FL297 ERCC1. No correlation was found between the two clones (p=0.1). There was no correlation between the expression of 8F1 ERCC1, FL297 ERCC1 and Ki-67 and the response to induction chemotherapy, OS or PFS.

        "Background":"[\"Cancer immunotherapy is rapidly changing the landscape of medical oncology and research. The rise of immunomodulatory therapies such as CTLA-4 inhibitors and the durable effects seen in many tumor types are exciting. Despite huge success in this area, positive effects are only observed in a percentage of treated subjects, and it is still not clear why this is the case or how to differentiate responder from non-responder a priori. To this end, a great deal of research is being directed towards the development of in-situ immune profile analyses of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in solid tumors that includes investigation of interdistributions of multiple immune cells and other markers important for immunotherapy (e.g., PD-1 and PD-L1). We present a combined method for the simultaneous IHC staining of up to 7 antigens, multispectral imaging (MSI), a per-cell quantitative analysis, cellular phenotyping and multivariate hypothesized interaction distribution (HID) analysis of the spatial interrelations among the cells within sections of standard clinical biopsies to search for patterns correlated with clinical outcome and therapeutic response. Whole sections of FFPE archival head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) biopsies from 130 subjects (96 male, 34 female, median 58 years, median follow up 60 months) were stained simultaneously for CD3, CD8, CD68, FOXP3, PD-1, PD-L1 using tyramide-conjugated fluorophores based on an Opal multiplexed IHC method. Each section was imaged in its entirety at 4x. Using an automated region selection method, approximately 20 multispectral images were acquired from regions of tumor and tumor margin at 20x. Each image was segmented into tumor, stromal and blank compartments. Cellular locations were found using the DAPI staining. The multimarker stain intensities of each cell were used to delineate each cell's phenotype. Patients are stratified based on human papillomavirus (HPV) status (P16 IHC, HPV DNA PCR, HPV DNA ISH). The phenotype, staining intensity pattern and spatial location for each TIL was then used as input into the HID analysis for an exploration of cellular patterns associated with good and poor clinical outcome in HPV positive or negative HNSCC. The complexity of tumor-immune interactions is driving the requirement for highly multiplexed in-situ cellular analyses. It is therefore even more relevant that a method such as exhibited here, capable of defining and measuring the effect on patient outcome of the spatial patterns of multiple cellular phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is available.\"]",

Similarly, SCNA were compared between HPV + and HPV - tumors identifying numerous differences, including a paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase alterations in HPV + tumors and novel deletions in chromosome 11q and 14q.

Consideration of differences between HPV + and HPV - tumors suggested differences which included nearly universal alteration of TP53 and frequent p16 mutations in HPV - tumors. By contrast, few TP53 or CDKN2A mutations were observed in HPV + samples. Strikingly, a large number of co-occurring genomic alterations were observed. For example, mutations of HRAS were observed nearly universally in combination with either CASP8 or FAT1. All three of these mutations were absent in HPV + patients. mRNA expression profiling revealed four distinct expression subtypes, each one enriched with distinct SCNA and mutational profiles', ' classical, basal, mesenchymal, and atypical.

We try to prove the difference of betel nuts-related HNSCC cell lines in several aspects reflecting clinical characteristics of HNSCC in Taiwan and design effective treatment combinations for future clinical trials and treatment decisions.Methods', 'HNSCC cell lines(SCC4, SCC9, SCC15, SCC25, FaDu, KB, Cal27, SAS, and TW2.6, betel-nuts related) were used to evaluate (1) the in vitro drug sensitivity(several chemotherapies and target agents); (2) synergistic effect of some target therapies and irradiation with MTT assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and western blot assay. TW2.6 had already been proved to possess defective p53, p16 loss, and increased Bcl2.Results', 'The MTT assay showed betel-nuts related TW2.6 was resistant to tradiational chemotherapies, radiation, EGFR inhibition, or anti-angiogenesis alone. TW2.6 was sensitive to high dose docetaxel and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235. Western blotting showed (1) p-AKT level was prominent in TW2.6 and correlated to BEZ235 response; (2) High PDL1 and VEGF levels in TW2.6 may confer to immunotherapy or anti-angiogenesis response; (3) Almost p16 loss in all cell lines; (4) Prominent Gli-1 expression in HPV-related FaDu and SCC25. SCC25, SAS, KB, and Cal27 showed good chemosensitivity. Well-differentiated cell lines(SCC4, 9, 15, 25), Cal27, and FaDu responded well to EGFR inhibitors. The cell viability assay showed that volasertib(polo like kinase inhibitor) did not decrease TW2.6 proliferation significantly. But clonogenic survival showed that combination of volasertib and radiation significantly enhanced radiation-induced death. The flow cytometry revealed that Plk1 inhibition by volasertib and radiation resulted in a significant G2/M cell cycle arrest. Western blotting also showed volasertib and radiation combination increased cyclin B levels and induced apoptosis.Conclusions', 'These findings suggested that TW2.6 might reflect treatment refractoriness of betel-nuts related HNSCC in Taiwan. PI3K/mTOR dual inhibition, anti-angiogenesis with chemotherapy, and immunotherapy are important strategies in our experiments. Besides, polo like kinase inhibition is a good radiosensitizer for TW2.6. Further animal studies, genetic studies, and array analysis will further clarify these points of views.

        "Background":"['We previously reported that tumor suppressor LZAP is lost in a portion of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and that LZAP inhibits NF-kB, while activating p53 in ARF-dependent and -independent fashions. The ability of LZAP to regulate p53 in the absence of ARF has been largely unexplored. Here, we show that LZAP depletion diminished expression of mutant and wild-type p53 protein. LZAP activity toward p53 was independent of ARF and the known p53 regulators, Wip1 and HDM2. Loss of LZAP decreased p53 translation and destabilized p53 protein due, at least partially, to increased nucleolin expression. Knockdown of LZAP abrogated p53 stabilization induced by ionizing radiation, and LZAP depletion protected wild-type p53 cells from radiation or chemotherapeutic agents, while rendering cells expressing mutant or no p53 more sensitive. In human HNSCC, LZAP levels correlated with p53 levels, and remarkably, tumors with low LZ were less likely to have p53 mutations. These data suggest that loss of LZAP represents a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation in human cancer. Given these findings, inhibition of LZAP activity toward p53 for patients with tumors harboring p53 mutations may represent a therapeutic strategy to simultaneously sensitize tumors while protecting normal tissues from radiation or chemotherapy.']",

Levels of methylation of LINE-1 (global methylation), and 6 other candidate genes previously associated with HNSCC (p16, DCC, NDN, CD1a, CCNA1 and Gadd45) were measured by pyrosequencing in biopsy, resection and whole blood specimens. Twelve patients were stage I/II, 27 were stage III/IV. Thirty one patients had cancer of the oral cavity, 4 had larynx and 4 had oropharynx cancer. Mean age of the patients was 60.1 (sd = 12.5).

In the last few decades, a steady increase in incidence rates of SCCOT has been reported across the world including India. SCCOT is known to be an age related disease and tobacco consumption is implicated as the main etiological agent, like other HNSCC subtypes. Recent reports have indicated an increase in incidence of SCCOT in the young and in nonsmokers. Among HNSCC, SCCOT appears to be more aggressive with respect to its clinical and biological behavior. Molecular genetic studies on SCCOT are scarce and most studies have been conducted on a small cohort of patients and/or restricted to a single/few molecular marker(s). We have conducted a multipronged molecular genetic study of SCCOT and analyzed the status of known tumorigenesis pathways including TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), microsatellite instability (MSI), CDKN2A, FHIT and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in surgically resected primary tumor samples and correlated with clinocopathological variables. 67% (67/100) of SCCOT samples exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization whereas a greater proportion (87/100; 87%) exhibited elevated EGFR expression, in accordance with existing literature. Interestingly, p53 nuclear stabilization was found to be more common in young (31/39; 79.5%) than in older (35/59; 59.3%) patients (p = 0.0481). As expected, patients with p53 nuclear stabilization exhibited poorer survival. Further, PCR based mutation screening of exons 5-8 of TP53 (encoding the DNA binding domain) revealed mutations in 50% of samples exhibiting nuclear stabilization. HPV infection was observed in 11/82 (13.4%) tumors while the frequencies of MSI (12/86; 14%) and loss of heterozygosity (LoH) in CDKN2A (32.6%) and FHIT (28.4%) loci were significantly higher than previous studies. In addition, LoH at FHIT locus was significantly associated with p53 nuclear stabilization (p=0.047). Analysis of genome-wide DNA copy number alterations (CNA) using array based comparative genomic hybridization revealed unique copy number alterations validated by quantitative PCR. Exome sequencing and transcriptome profiling are currently underway to understand the pathways/genes deregulated in SCCOT, especially in samples not exhibiting p53 nuclear stabilization.']",

P16INK4a is a known surrogate marker for HPV positivity; however the relationship between radiation sensitivity and P16INK4a has not been completely elucidated in this context. Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitylating enzyme that cleaves ubiquitin from substrates to stabilize target proteins. USP7 overexpression is a predictor of poor prognosis in lung carcinomas and correlates with disease progression and lower survival in gliomas. More recent studies have shown USP7 has a role in the stability of DNA damage response proteins such as RNF168, BRCA1 and Chk1; and USP7 knockdown has been shown to radio-sensitize breast cancer cells to radiation. We have investigated the possible role of USP7 in the radio-response of HNSCC cells in the context of HPV status.Methods', ' Four HPV(+) and four HPV(-) HNSCC were chosen for this study. The radio-response was determined by clonogenic survival assay. P16INK4a overexpression was generated using lentivirus. Western blot analysis was used for visualizing protein expression. The Cancer Genome Atlas was interrogated to examine the relationship between USP7 and clinical outcome.Results', ' Our data suggest P16INK4a negatively regulates USP7 and leads to the more radiosensitive phenotype associated with HPV(+)HNSCC. Radio-resistant HPV(-) HNSCC cell lines show higher levels of USP7 than HPV(+) lines and over-expression of P16INK4a in HPV(-) HN5 cells leads to down-regulation of USP7 and radio-sensitization. Conversely, P16INK4a siRNA knockdown in HPV(+) UMSCC-47 shows an increase of USP7 protein expression and radio-resistance. P22077, an inhibitor of USP7 activity, was also shown to radiosensitize a HPV(-) cell line. This shows proof of principle that inhibiting USP7 can be a viable approach to sensitizing HPV(-) HNSCC to radiation. USP7 overexpression was also associated with poorer overall survival in HNSCC.Conclusion', ' These results suggest that USP7 may be a marker of clinical radioresistance in HNSCC and that its inhibition has the potential to improve the treatment outcome of patients with HPV(-) HNSCC when combined with radiotherapy.']",

Cellular senescence is an extremely stable form of cell cycle arrest that limits the proliferation of damaged cells and may act as a natural barrier to cancer progression. MUC4, a high molecular weight glycoprotein, is overexpressed in many cancers and is implicated in cell proliferation, adhesion, anti-apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, migration and invasion of various carcinomas, but nothing is known about its clinical relevance and the mechanism through which it regulates cancer progression in HNSCC. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate clinical relevance and a potential role of MUC4 in cellular senescence in HNSCCs.Using immunohistochemical analysis, we observed a significant up regulation of MUC4 in 79% (68/86) of HNSCC tissue samples compared to only 10% (1/10) of benign tissues. Further, we observed high expression of MUC4 in a majority of HNSCC cell lines tested. Knockdown (KD) of MUC4 with specific shRNA in HNSCC cells markedly decreased cell proliferation. The doubling time increased from 26 h to 36 h and 34 h to 42 h in MUC4 silenced UMSCC-1 and SCC-10B cells, respectively as compared to their control counterparts. MUC4 KD in UMSCC-1 and UMSCC-10B cells resulted in accumulation of cells at the G0/G1 phase with concomitant decrease in the expression of cell cycle regulating proteins like Cyclin-E and Cyclin-D1, and decrease in BrDU incorporation. More importantly, MUC4 KD resulted in the induction of cellular senescence in both cell lines as indicated by an increase in the number of flat, enlarged and senescence-associated -galactosidase (SA--Gal) positive cells. Further,MUC4 KD resulted in the inhibition of FAK signaling, and decreased motility and invasive behavior in both UMSCC-1 and UMSCC-10B cells. Mechanistic dissection of senescent response to MUC4 silencing indicated decreased acetylated histone enrichment at Cyclin-E/Cyclin-D1 promoters, leading to their downregulation. Further, both cell lines UMSCC-1 and UMSCC-10B underwent a P16 and P21 dependent cellular senescence in response to MUC4 KD that requires inactivation of Akt and ERK signaling. In conclusions, these findings suggest a novel role of MUC4 in regulating cellular senescence and provide evidence of the functional role of MUC4 in the proliferation, motility and invasion of HNSCC cells. Therefore, downregulation of MUC4 may be a promising therapeutic approach for Head and Neck cancer treatment.']",

Methods', ' Eligibility criteria was the patients diagnosed as SCC of tonsil and received curative radical resection with available tumor tissue samples. In situ hybridization for HPV and immunohistochemistry for p16, EGFR, and p53 were performed. Results', ' Among 66 tonsil cancer patients, 24 (36.3%) patients showed HPV positivity. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics including sex, age, smoking history, TNM stage and treatment modalities between HPV-positive and -negative patients. The over-expression and high intensity of p16 had significant correlation with HPV positivity (p=0.003, 0.017). However, no correlation was found between p53 and HPV infection. There was a trend that the proportion of EGFR over-expression was greater in HPV-negative than in HPV-positive patients (p=0.082), and no or low EGFR intensity was observed in the patients showing p16 over-expression (p=0.015). Among the HPV-positive patients, the frequency of EGFR over-expression was significantly higher in ex- or current smokers (p=0.005). There was meaningful difference of three years disease-free survival between never smokers showing both over-expression of p16 and low expression of EGFR and the others (90.0% and 73.5%, respectively, p=0.082). On univariate analysis, the significant clinicopathologic factors affecting disease-free survival were smoking history and EGFR intensity (p=0.020 and 0.017, respectively). Conclusions', ' Taken together, p16 was a good surrogate marker for HPV infection. The expression of EGFR was inversely correlated with HPV positivity, but HPV-positive patients with smoking history showed EGFR over-expression.

Given the histopathologic similarity between these two lesions, distinguishing metastasis from a second primary lung SCC is often based on clinical grounds.

We demonstrate the potential of a commercially available genomic platform to resolve this clinical dilemma. Methods', ' A 64-year-old 20 pack-year former smoking male with history of HPV-associated oropharyngeal (OP) cancer 4 years prior presented with an asymptomatic 4.5 cm right hilar mass on surveillance images. Following surgical resection, the patient was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy for pT2aN1 (stage IIB) presumed lung SCC. To settle concerns this was a late recurrence of HNSCC, the primary OP and resected lung tumors were subjected to histopathologic analysis, p16 immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization (ISH) for HPV 16/18 DNA, and tumor NGS via FoundationOne. Results', ' Both tumors showed poor differentiation, had strong nuclear and cytoplasmic p16 staining, and were positive for integrated HPV 16/18 by ISH. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) by NGS for both specimens (OP, lung) reported the same somatic mutation in CYLD (K664*; c.1990 A > T) as the sole genomic alteration; moreover, the OP and lung specimens shared 11 of 12 variants of uncertain significance, confirming metastasis from the original OP. The CYLD mutation, present in 6% of HPV-associated HNSCC, results in C-terminal truncation and disruption of CYLD deubiquitinase activity, and is associated with NFB pathway activation. No chemotherapy was given, and PET/CT imaging 4 months after resection showed no evidence of disease. Conclusions', ' This is the first report of CGP by NGS to confirm the etiology of secondary squamous lung tumors in patients with HNSCC.

In the last few decades, a steady increase in incidence rate of SCCT has been reported across the world. More importantly, though SCCT is considered to be a tobacco-related late-onset cancer, recent reports indicate an increase in incidence of SCCT in the young and in non-smokers. We analyzed the status of known tumorigenic pathways/genes including TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), microsatellite instability (MSI), CDKN2A, FHIT and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in 120 surgically resected primary oral SCCT (SCCOT) samples and correlated with clinico-pathological variables and disease specific survival. 78 of 121 (65%) samples exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization confirming earlier reports. Interestingly, p53 nuclear stabilization was more common in young (36/46; 78%) than in older (44/75; 56%) patients (p = 0.0184). Further, PCR based mutation screening of exons 5-8 (encoding the DNA binding domain of p53) revealed mutations in ten of nineteen samples (52.6%) that exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization and in three of fifteen tumors (20%) that did not. We identified a novel 33bp deletion, c.616-648del33, located in exon 5 in a p53 positive tumor from a chronic tobacco chewer. Case control analysis revealed that Proline at TP53 codon 72 increased the risk of SCCOT. Majority of samples (97/121; 80%) exhibited significant EGFR expression though HPV infection was rare (14/106; 13%). MSI was observed in 14/106 (13%) samples, a frequency higher than reported for other populations. Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) was more frequently observed in CDKN2A (28%) and FHIT (26%). In addition, LOH at FHIT locus was significantly associated with p53 nuclear stabilization (p = 0.0508), especially in non-smokers. A significant difference in survival rate between p53 positive and negative group (p = 0.0056) (Hazard ratio 2.5595) was observed. Though associated with p53 stabilization, FHIT loss did not exhibit significant effect on patient survival. Interestingly, patients exhibiting p53 nuclear stabilization as well as FHIT loss exhibited worse survival. We performed genome-wide DNA copy number and transcript profiling in several SCCOT samples. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in extent and profile of chromosomal instability in p53 positive and negative tumors. Amplifications were detected at chromosomal regions 3q26.1 (PIK3CA), 5p, 8q22 (MYC, RUNX1T1), 11q13 (CCND1) and 20q13 (HNF). Genome-wide transcript profiling identified novel pathways that appear to drive tumorigenesis in tumors not exhibiting p53 inactivation. Our comprehensive analysis has therefore revealed important insights into the molecular basis for SCCOT and identified prognostic indicators in patients not associated with tobacco use.']",

Here we evaluated if epigenetic regulation by VA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), combined with CRT in LA HNSCC improves response rate (RR). Methods', ' Patients with unresectable oropharynx (OP) and oral cavity LA HNSCC were included in this Simon two-stage phase II trial. After two weeks of VA (P1), CRT was initiated. Primary goal was RR at 8 weeks after CRT+VA (P2) by RECIST v 1.1. 8/20 and 25/32 responses were needed in the first and second stages for the trial to be considered positive ( = 0.05,  = 0.2). MicroRNA (miR) PCR-array profiling in plasma samples at baseline, P1 and P2, was compared to healthy controls by two sample t-test for each miR. Distribution of p-values was analyzed by beta-uniform mixture. HDAC2 and HR23B tumor immunohistochemistry were also evaluated. Results', ' Ten LA p16 negative OP pts were included. High-risk HPV was detected in 3 pts samples. Median age was 55 years (41-65). All pts were male, smokers or ex-smokers and with previous moderate/high alcohol intake. Due to significant toxicities seen in an interim safety analysis, accrual was terminated. A RR of 88% was achieved in 9 evaluable pts. A total of 169 miRs were differently expressed among pts and controls (FDR 0.05), including lower expression of known tumor suppressors (TS) such as miR-31, -222, -let-7b and -145. There were no significant differences in the pattern of miR expression at P1 vs. baseline. P2 vs. baseline had lower levels of miR-31, particularly in responders (p 0.007). TCGA HNSCC pts with low levels of miR-31 had a trend towards higher relapse free survival (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99-1.25; p = 0.073). Non-responders had no difference in miR expression between baseline and P2. HDAC2 H-score above 170 was 90% accurate in predicting 6-month disease free survival. Conclusions', ' Although improved RR was seen with VA+CRT, prohibitive toxicities prevented the trial from continuing. Cancer pts and controls had distinct pattern of miR expression, mainly with low levels of TS targeting TP53. miR-31 deregulation in HNSCC needs to be further elucidated.

Methods', ' Stage III/IVB HNSCC deemed borderline resectable by a multidisciplinary team were enrolled in a phase 1, 3 + 3 design to evaluate escalating doses of AZD1775 starting at 125 mg PO BID x 2.5 days alone as lead-in and in combination with cisplatin (25mg/m2) and docetaxel (35 mg/m2) for three additional weeks. Tumors were sequenced with UWOncoPlex (262 cancer genes); HPV status assessed via p16 IHC; toxicities graded with CTCAE v. 4.04; responses measured via RECIST 1.1 and through pathologic assessment when available. Trial is open but primary endpoints were met. Results', ' Eleven patients were screened; 10 enrolled and were evaluable for toxicities. The most common Grade  2 toxicities were diarrhea (4), fatigue (4), neutropenia (3) and nausea (3). The drug-limiting toxicity was Grade 3 diarrhea (2). The MTD was established at 150mg PO BID x 2.5 days, alone and in combination with neoadjuvant cisplatin and docetaxel. Two patients were HPV+/TP53wt, 1 was HPV+/TP53 mut; 6 were TP53mut/HPV-; 1 was TP53 wt/HPV-. Seven out 10 patients had a response.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Studies by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and others have identified regions of somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Both tumor types exhibit frequent SCNAs in chromosomes 3q, 9p, and 11q. Although CDKN2A is the putative target of 9p deletions, numerous targets have been proposed in the 3q amplicon, including SOX2, PIK3CA, and TP63. Because expression levels are affected by underlying genomic events, we hypothesized that an integrated analysis of multiple genomic data types would provide increased ability to identify target genes in SCNA regions when compared to methods based on copy number alone while providing insight into mechanisms regulating expression. Findings may be subsequently validated by examining multiple tumor types or performing training/testing analyses.Techniques', ' Gene expression (GE), DNA copy number (CN), DNA methylation (ME), and microRNA expression (miR) data were obtained from the TCGA studies of HNSCC and LUSC. Linear models were constructed for each gene to investigate the effect of changes in CN, ME, and miR on GE. Analysis of model output provided an approach to identify target genes in SCNA regions and assess the effect of genomic alterations on expression.Results', ' Genome-wide GE, CN, ME, and miR data were available for n = 279 (HNSCC) and n = 159 (LUSC) tumor samples. Univariate modeling detected a strong overall association between GE and CN, as measured by the coefficient of determination (model R2). Although some genes found in SCNA studies produced large model R2 e.g. SOX2 a number of genes with large model R2 are relatively unknown. Notable examples include DVL3, and SENP2, which were implicated as driver genes in the 3q amplicon by a recent study of LUSC but not identified in the TCGA report. Remarkably, the model R2 for DVL3 and SENP2 was also high in HNSCC, and such a finding in a distinct tumor type provides validation and merits additional study. Output from models additionally including ME and miR as covariates contributes insight into the diversity of regulation of gene expression, but the strength of the association between GE and CN could mask other effects. Thus we constructed linear models in which the response variable was the residuals from the GE/CN model and the covariates were ME or miR. The TCGA study of glioblastoma noted frequent methylation of MGMT. When modeling MGMT we detected a highly significant association between ME and the GE/CN residuals in both HNSCC and LUSC. These results illustrate a pronounced effect of ME on GE conditional on CN.Conclusion', ' Linear modeling techniques provide a flexible and powerful basis for performing integrated analysis of genomic data. Our approach produces predicted results when analyzing known cancer genes, highlights lesser known genes for future study, provides insight into gene regulation, and draws attention to genes relevant in multiple tumor types.']",

Methods', '  HNSCC specimens were collected from 1999 until 2002. Pre-therapy tumor biopsies (blocks or slides) were assessed for high risk (HR) HPV by p16 immunohistochemistry, PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR). HPV DNA+ and/or p16+ tumors were subjected to in situ hybridization (ISH) and HPV E6/7 oncogene expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcriptase. The primary and secondary objectives were to evaluate the value of HPV/p16 status as predictive factor of treatment benefit in terms of PFS and OS, respectively.

The pre-planned analysis showed no statistical evidence of  predictive value of p16/HPV status for PFS (p = 0.287) or OS (p = 0.118).  Conclusions', '  The incidence of HPV positivity was low in EORTC 24971 cohort. In this prospective- retrospective analysis only powered to detect a large treatment by marker interaction there was no statistical evidence that treatment effect found overall was different in magnitude in HPV positive or HPV negative patients.

However there is still a large population with intrinsic resistance. To evaluate the mechanisms and find alternative treatments we started establishing a large panel of patient derived xenografts from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas displaying the heterogeneity of this disease, as cell lines and thereof established xenografts have only a limited value for preclinical drug evaluation and biomarker analysis due to clonal selection and cellular dedifferentiation. Using these models we evaluate new treatment options, identify predictive biomarkers and test the sensitivity of experimental drugs and treatment approaches.Methods', ' Specimen from head and neck tumor samples were transplanted subcutaneously to immunodeficient mice within 24 hours. In case of engraftment groups of 5-6 mice were treated after 3rd passage with 5-FU, MTX, Cetuximab, Carboplatin, Docetaxel and Everolimus. Treatment was applied for 3 weeks. Response to treatment was evaluated by comparing growth inhibition of treated tumors in relation to a control group. Patient tumors and xenografts were evaluated for HPV status by immunohistochemical staining of p16INK4A and detection of HPV-16 E6 and E7 viral DNA by PCR. Primary tumor and the derived xenografts are screened for common oncogenic mutations using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon - Cancer Panel and for genetic expression profiles by Affymetrix analysisResults', ' In total, 70 tumor samples were transplanted resulting in 26 stably growing patient derived xenografts and 21 remain presently ongoing. So far only 23 xenotransplanted tumors did not grow. This results in an engraftment rate of >60%. Tumors remained histologically similar through several passages. Engraftment was not related to growth fraction of the primary tumor, ranging from 10 to 90% evaluated by Ki67 staining. In a few cases we were able to establish xenografts from primary tumors and synchronous metastases. These showed high similarity concerning growth rate and drug sensitivity. Response to treatment varied considerably. Significant growth inhibition in relation to the control group was observed in 8 of 11 (72%) treated tumors for Everolimus, in 4/11 (36%) for 5-FU, 3/11 (27%) for MTX, in 3/11 (27%) for Carboplatin, in 3/11 (27%) for Cetuximab and in 6/11 (54%) for Docetaxel. Out of the established xenografts four primary tumors were classified as HPV positive but only one of them remained positive after several passages in mice.Conclusion', ' Our newly established head and neck cancer panel provides an excellent tool for preclinical drug and biomarker research. Together with the molecular genetic characterization, these patient derived xenografts can be used for modeling the systemic biology of the tumor and can help to develop new rational hypotheses for further clinical trials.']",

The main risk factors are tobacco and alcohol use and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Early detection tests are needed because the majority of patients present in late stage when cure rates reach only 40%. Our group has developed a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive diagnostic test based on soluble CD44 (solCD44) and total protein levels. We used a case-control design to evaluate soluble markers for HNSCC in 150 oropharyngeal (OP) and lip/oral cavity (Lip/OC) patients and 150 controls frequency matched for age, gender, race, ethnicity, tobacco use and socioeconomic status. We compared patient groups with respect to important covariates using the chi-square, Fisher's exact test, or t-test. Markers mean levels were compared either by t-test or ANOVA, followed by pairwise multiple comparisons. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate predictivity of the salivary markers univariately and multivariately with adjustment for demographics and risk factors. We report odds ratio (OR) estimates with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and area under the curve (AUC) of the operating characteristic curve (ROC) for fitted models. The case-control groups did not differ in regards to age, gender, race, ethnicity, history of ever vs. never smoking, current alcohol use, number of teeth removed, or county vs. private hospital system. The mean log2CD44 and protein levels were elevated in cases (log2 CD44= 1.94 ng/ml, protein=0.93 mg/ml) compared to controls (log2 CD44= 1.28 ng/ml, protein= 0.76 mg/ml), (p<.0001; p=.003, respectively). Log2CD44 levels were significantly elevated in older vs. younger cases (p<0.05). There were no significant mean log2 CD44 level differences between Lip/OC and OP cases, TNM or HPV status in cancer patients. In the cases for which HPV status was available (as measured by the surrogate marker p16), log 2 CD44 levels varied by smoking status (lower in never smokers), by drinking status in HPV + cases (lower in non-drinkers) and N-stage (higher levels in N0, Nx vs. N1-N3 in HPV-positive and the opposite effect in HPV-negative tumors). For protein, there were no differences in either the case or the control group based on demographic or risk variables. When we stratified by HPV status, race/ethnicity and drinking status did have an effect (higher levels in blacks vs. WNH and higher in current vs. former and never/mild drinkers in HPV positive tumors only). A specific model was developed for each of the 3 race/ethnicity groups with the highest AUC for blacks (AUC= .835) and WNH (AUC= .831) followed by HW (AUC= .777). Models included log2CD44, protein, smoking, gender and age; strongly suggesting that these factors play an important role for HNSCC early detection studies.\"]",

To better understand the power, limitations and relevance of our tumorgraft system, we have initiated molecular characterization of these tumors. Methods', ' Patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HNSCC were consented for donation of tumor at the time of surgery. Tumor tissue was obtained, washed in antibiotic rich media, manually disaggregated, and subcutaneously implanted into mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) for initial tumorgraft establishment. Subsequent mouse-to-mouse passages were performed and formalin-fixed/paraffin embedded as well as flash frozen tissue was harvested for subsequent molecular analyses. Expression of p16(Ink4a), p53, pRB, and EGFR was assessed by immunohistochemistry(IHC). HPV status and subtype was assessed using MY09/MY11 and GP5/GP6 degenerate nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Transcriptionally active HPV infection was assessed by qRT-PCR for the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7. Mutation status of p53 was assessed by PCR-based exon amplification and Sanger sequencing. Results', ' To date, thirty primary tumorgrafts have been established with robust growth in eighteen (60%). p16(INK4A) expression was identified in approximately one-third. The majority of HPV-positive tumorgrafts contained HPV-16 and were transcriptionally active by mRNA expression profiling. HPV-positive tumors showed low p53 and RB expression by IHC. As anticipated, mutations in p53 were seen more frequently in HPV-negative tumors. Conclusions', ' These primary human tumorgrafts represent a diverse range of head and neck cancers. Both HPV-positive tumors and HPV-negative tumors have been successfully propagated with a diverse range of molecular characteristics.

Recently we developed a novel mouse model of oral cancer induced by DB[a, l]P; we also showed the remarkable carcinogenicity and specificity of the fjord region diol epoxide metabolite, ()-anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a, l]pyrene (DB[a, l]PDE). Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we have shown over-expression of p53 protein in mice oral squamous cell carcinoma and dysplastic tissues induced by DB[a, l]P and DB[a, l]PDE. Current understanding of molecular pathogenesis of oral cancer in humans suggests that both genetic and epigenetic alterations are crucial and complement each other. Our hypothesis is that both genetic and epigenetic alterations induced by DB[a, l]P can contribute to the development of oral cancer. P53 protein overexpression detected by IHC may result from p53 gene mutation or exposure to genotoxic stress. To determine whether p53 over-expression is in part due to p53 mutations, Exons 5 to 8 of p53 from 5 tumor tissues were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphisms (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. G to T transversion was detected in Exon 5, leading to mutation of codon 155 Arg to Leu; A to T transversion was detected in Exon 7, resulting in mutation of codon 232 Lys to stop codon. To test the epigenetic effect of DB[a, l]P, methylation specific PCR and bisulfate sequencing were used to detect methylation alteration of p16 and RAR- promoters. Promoter hypermethylation of both p16 and RAR- were detected in tumors induced by DB[a, l]PDE; also in oral tissues of mice treated with DB[a, l]P (24nmol, 3 times per week, for 5 weeks, sacrificed at 48 h, 1, 2 and 4 weeks after last dose). These results suggested that genotoxic DNA adducts derived from DB[a, l]P can induce mutations in critical genes, such as tumor suppressor gene p53; this environmental carcinogen also can induce p16 and RAR- promoter hypermethylation at early stage, which can contribute to the promotion and progression of oral carcinogenesis.']",

Methods', ' We designed a semiquantitative PCR approach to detect circulating HPV DNA using the L1 Gp5/6 degenerate primer as well as HPV16/18 E6 and E7 nested primers. We used this approach to detect HPV DNA in culture media of SCC90, a HPV(+) OP cell line as well as plasma samples of SCC90 bearing SCID mice. Control mice were those implanted with non-HPV tumors. HPV DNA was also assessed in pretreatment plasma samples of 32 HPV(+) OP patients and 4 HPV(-) control patients with other head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Plasma HPV DNA levels were also quantified by a fluorescent probe multiplex real-time PCR (QRTPCR) assay, targeting the HPV16/18 E6 region, in 6 patients with HPV(+) OP and serial plasma samples obtained during radiotherapy (RT). Results', ' Cell-free HPV DNA was detected in the culture media of SCC90 and the plasma of SCC90 bearing mice but not in control mice. It was detected in pretreatment plasma of 84% HPV(+) patients and in none of the HPV(-) controls using the L1 primers and conventional PCR. However using less sensitive primer sets (nested E6 and E7), plasma HPV DNA was positive in only 50% of patients with detectable E6/E7 DNA in the tumors. QRTPCR was able to detect as low as 10 copies of HPV DNA in each reaction. In 6 patients with serial plasma samples during RT, QRTPCR measurement showed a rapid decline in HPV DNA level, which became undetectable at RT completion. Conclusions', ' The xenograft studies indicate that plasma HPV DNA is released directly from HPV-related tumors.

Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles of Notch have been implicated in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We investigated the functional consequences of Notch activation in head and neck as well as esophageal SCCs (HNSCC and ESCC). Methods', ' Primary tumor tissues annotated with known clinical outcomes were analyzed. Human esophageal cells immortalized with telomerase or human papilloma virus E6/E7 genes, their derivatives expressing mutant p53 and ESCC cell lines were stably transduced with ICN1, an active form of Notch1 in a regulatable manner (Tet-On system). Notch was inhibited by dominant negative mastermind-like1 (DNMAML1), a genetic pan-Notch inhibitor or -secretase inhibitors (GSI). 8xCSL-luciferase reporter was used to assess Notch-mediated transcriptional activity. RNA interference was done targeting either CSL or p16INK4A. Senescence was determined by cell growth inhibition and senescence-associated -galactosidase assays. Cell growth was tested in soft agar and immunodeficient mice. Gene expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results', ' In primary tumors, the active form of Notch1 (ICN1Val1744) was detected as intense nuclear staining of tumor cells in the invasive fronts in 29% of HNSCC (n=17) and 56% of ESCC (n=171). Nuclear ICN1Val1744 was significantly associated with a poor 5-year survival in postsurgical ESCC patients (n=115). In culture, ICN1 induced cellular senescence through CSL-dependent p16INK4A induction, which was antagonized by DNMAML1 or knockdown of either CSL or p16INK4A. Moreover, ICN1 failed to induce senescence in immortalized cells expressing E6/E7 or ESCC cells with a deleted INK4 locus. However, p53 mutation did not prevent ICN1-induced senescence. In soft agar and xenograft transplantation, ICN1 stimulated colony formation and tumor growth of ESCC cells that negated senescence. Histology revealed an increased number of less-differentiated tumor cells upon ICN1 induction. Moreover, GSI treatment of mice with xenografted ESCC cells resulted in tumor necrosis. Conclusions', ' These data indicate that Notch activation contributes to disease progression in ESCC. While ICN1 induces senescence, loss of p16INK4A-mediated senescence checkpoint point functions may be required in ICN1-mediated malignant transformation, thus providing a novel mechanistic insight into how Notch signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCCs.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' SCCHN is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Current second-line treatments for human papillomavirus (HPV)negative, R/M SCCHN have marginal effectiveness and significant toxicity. Therefore, improved treatment options are needed. Inhibition of the cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/Rb axis using the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PAL) represents a rational treatment approach for patients (pts) with incurable, cetuximab-naive, HPV-negative SCCHN because loss of RB1 is infrequent but loss of CDKN2A expression or amplification of CCND1 occurs in most cases; the majority of a large cell line panel responded at low nanomolar concentrations of PAL; and PAL exhibited significant single-agent activity in a series of HNSCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. A combinatorial approach with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor cetuximab may further enhance antitumor effects because EGFR overexpression is considered an important driver in SCCHN pathogenesis; EGFR inhibition demonstrated strong synergy in combination with PAL in vitro; and PAL plus cetuximab showed significant antitumor activity in an HNSCC PDX model. A phase 1 trial established the safety of combining PAL with cetuximab in pts with incurable SCCHN, with a decrease in tumor target lesions observed in approximately 50% of pts (Michel, ASCO 2015, Abs', ' 6043). Methods', ' Patients with HPV-negative, cetuximab-naive R/M SCCHN after failure of 1 platinum-containing regimen will be randomized 1', '1 to receive either 125 mg PAL orally daily for 21 days followed by a 7-day break in combination with weekly cetuximab (initial dose, 400 mg/m2 followed by 250 mg/m2) or placebo plus the same regimen of cetuximab.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' The Aurora kinases represent a family of serine/threonine kinases important in regulating cell cycle progression. Aurora-A is required for centrosome function and mitotic spindle assembly. Aurora-A phosphosphorylation supports the activity of many proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival, including important EGFR effectors such as AKT and RAS. High expression of Aurora A has been shown in patients with breast, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and gynecological cancers. The Aurora kinases are known to promote tumor formation and progression, which has led investigators to develop multiple inhibitors of Aurora kinases for clinical use. The expression of Aurora-A kinase in head and neck cancers is not well understood. We assessed the overall survival (OS) for a cohort of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) based upon Aurora-A and phospho-Aurora-A kinase expression (reflecting active Aurora-A). We also related this to SCCHN subtype, using p16 expression as a surrogate for human papillomavirus association, because of the recognition that p16 + cancers have far superior prognosis. Methods', ' Tumor tissue from 89 patients with SCCHN operated on at the Fox Chase Cancer Center was analyzed for Aurora-A and phospho-Aurora-A expression. Aurora kinase expression was determined using AQUATM, with the median values used to distinguish over-expressers. Aurora-A and phospho-Aurora-A expression was correlated with T and N stage and OS, in p16+ versus p16- tumors The p16 status was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results', \" T stage was inversely related to Aurora-A expression when adjusted for p16 status (Spearman's rho -0.24, p = 0.04). Aurora-A expression was not related to N stage (Spearman's rho -0.03, p = 0.79). OS was 36 months for over-expressers of Aurora-A and 92 months for patients with low levels of Aurora-A expression (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.05-3.46). 20 patients were positive for p16 by IHC. There was no difference in survival amongst p16 positive patients based on Aurora-A expression (53.3 months vs 57.2 months, p = 0.679). Amongst the 69 p16 negative patients, OS was 93.6 months for patients with low levels of Aurora-A expression and 35.9 months for those with elevated levels of Aurora-A (HR 1.84, 95% CI 0.89-3.79). There was a trend towards improved survival in patients with lower levels of phospho-Aurora-A expression (63.9 vs 57.6 months, p = 0.129). Conclusions\", ' Increased expression of Aurora-A in this cohort of SCCHN patients is associated with a significant decrease in OS. Increased expression of Aurora-A in patients with p16 positive tumors does not seem to impact survival, though the number of patients was small.

The expression of p16 in head and neck cancer is a reliable surrogate for HPV, and its presence portends a good prognosis. The goal of our study was to analyze archival lung tissue for the presence of p16 expression and HPV infection among never smokers or < 10 pack year smoking patients with NSCLC.Methods', ' Surgical specimens from never/light smokers was identified in the Fox Chase Cancer Center Biosample Repository. A tissue microarray was constructed for immunohistochemistry analysis on the quantitative platform, AQUA, for p16. DNA was also extracted from archival tissue for assessment of p16 status. Real-time PCR and reverse hybridization (INNO-LiPA) was utilized to detect evidence of HPV genes in tumor samples. In order to determine if the viral genome was episomal or integrated, PCR to determine E2', 'E6 ratios were employed.

Some studies have correlated the abundance of ctDNA with tumor size and stage, with as much as 10% of ctDNA in advanced-stage cancers but as low as 0.1-1% in premalignant or early stage disease. Only one published study has explored the detection of ctDNA in Head and neck tumors in advanced cancers detecting mutations in 60% of the cases.Our primary goal was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the presence of ctDNA in circulating blood fractions from a series of HNSCC cases at early and late stages. We also evaluated the extent to which measures of ctDNA in blood samples correlate with similar findings from paired tumor tissue and correlate with outcome. 48 cases (including plasma, tumor and germline samples) diagnosed as head and neck SCC were selected from a multi center case- control study (ARCAGE), conducted between 2002-2005 involving 10 countries across Europe.

Clinical observations have revealed frequent and early lymph node metastasis and unusual distant metastasis in HPV-associated as compared with HPV-negative OPSCC. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we have studied whether -catenin, one of the major proteins in the Wnt pathway, is involved in HPV-associated OPSCC metastasis. Methods', ' The study samples (n = 210) were collected from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded OPSCC tissues obtained from the Surgical Pathology files in the Department of Pathology at Emory University following the regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Results', ' Our results showed that membrane WI of -catenin was inversely correlated with p16 positivity (p < 0.0001), while nuclear staining of -catenin was associated with p16 positive OPSCC (p = 0.007) and positive lymph nodes (p = 0.0304). A low level of membrane -catenin (cut-off by the median value) was significantly associated with disease free survival and overall survival (p < 0.05 in both cases). Furthermore, WI EGFR was positively correlated with nuclear -catenin (p = 0.0001). Our in vitro study showed that nuclear -catenin level was higher in HPV16-positive HNSCC cell lines than in HPV16-negative cell lines. Furthermore, HPV16-positive cells showed higher EGFR activation than HPV16-negative cells. Reduction of HPV16 E6 led to the de-activation of EGFR and decreased level of -catenin in the nucleus. Conclusion', ' Our findings suggest that HPV16 E6 mediates the translocation of -catenin to the nucleus, which may be regulated by activated EGFR. The underlying mechanism deserves further investigation.

        "Background":"['Single disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) found in secondary organs (i.e. bone marrow BM, lung, liver) appear to activate a quiescence program and undergo a dormancy phase triggered by specific tissue microenvironment signals. The timing of this asymptomatic clinical phase may rely on specific signals that convert a previous non-permissive/non-proliferative environment into a permissive one, fueling metastasis development. The mechanisms underlying dormancy and means to maintain this state remain unknown. Here we show that the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F1/COUP-TF1 is silenced in breast and HNSCC tumors, cancer cell lines and MMTV-Neu and -Myc mouse tumor models. Surprisingly, retinoid signaling, stress signaling and microenvironmental cues from target organs (i.e. bone marrow) can induce re-expression of NR2F1 and dormancy of HNSCC cells. Forced NR2F1 re-expression resulted in induction of tumor cell quiescence in vivo and this effect depended on the expression of the transcription factor SOX9 and p27 induction. In contrast, RNAi-mediated silencing of NR2F1 or SOX9 interrupted the quiescence of dormant tumor cells. Further, quiescence induction was associated with p27, p15, p16 and HES-1. Mechanistic analysis revealed that NR2F1 is primarily nuclear and that its expression is activated by MKK6-p38 stress signaling and is negatively regulated by DNA promoter methylation. Lastly, we showed that atRA treatment followed 5-Aza-C treatment reprograms tumorigenic cells into dormancy in an NR2F1-dependent fashion. Our data suggest that re-expression of NR2F1 may promote reprogramming of aggressive tumor cells into dormancy identifying a new target for maintenance therapies for residual disease.']",

Parallel analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) resources was used to establish whether correlative relationships observed at the protein level reflected commensurate changes in mRNA expression, in an independent study cohort. For this purpose, mRNA expression values were imported from the (provisional) TCGA data set encompassing 295 SCCHN samples, and Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated.Results\", ' Correlation coefficients indicated a significant positive association between nuclear expression of the following markers', ' ERCC1 and AuroraA (p<0.0001); ERCC1 and pAurora (p=0.0027); Aurora A and pAurora (p<0.0001); survivin and Aurora A (p=0.0064); and survivin and ERCC1 (p=0.0084). Review of mRNA levels of Aurora A and survivin in the TCGA database indicated a highly significant correlation between these two markers (r=0.59, p=0.0002). This striking correlation did not represent common amplification of a chromosomal locus, given distinct chromosomal locations of Aurora A (20q13), and survivin (17q25). The relation of elevated expression of the biomarkers to prognosis was analyzed, considering biomarkers alone and in combination. A particularly important role for survivin was established, independent of other variables.Conclusions', ' ERCC1, Aurora A, and survivin displayed significantly correlated expression in HPV (-) SCCHN, supporting linked function in SCCHN. This works suggests a cluster of biomarkers worthy of future study.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Approximately 5% of all cancers result from HPV, commonly leading to head and neck (HN) and anogenital (AG) cancers. Immune therapy is used in many cancers including HN. Positive PDL1 and high tumor mutation load (TML) have been proposed as potential markers of immunogenicity among many tumors, but little is known specifically among HPV driven cancers. Methods', ' A retrospective analysis of patients with HPV related cancers was performed based on tissue availability. TP53 wild type status was used as a surrogate for HPV positivity. Among oropharynx cases with TP53 wt, p16 testing was performed for confirmation. Next generation Sequencing (NGS Sanger) was used for tumor mutation load (TML) calculation. High TML cut off was defined as 17 mutations/megabase based on prior publications. PDL1 status was reported based on IHC 5%. A 2-tail Fishers exact test was utilized for statistical analysis. Results', ' A total of 737 patients with HN and AG (cervical, anal, vulvar, penile) squamous cell carcinoma were identified. Of these, 251 had complete 592 gene panel NGS data. HPV + TP53 Wt disease was detected in oropharynx (70%), cervical (88%), and anal (82%) cancer. HPV+ HNSCC had a trend to a higher PDL1 compared to HPV neg (50% vs 31%, p = 0.16) but there were no significant differences among PDL1 between HPV+ and neg patients across the entire combined disease cohorts (41% vs 36%, p = 0.56). TML-high patients showed a trend to increased PDL1 positivity (60% vs 38%, p = 0.09). However, high TML was less common in HPV+ HNSCC vs HPV neg (2.2 vs. % 9.7% p = 0.19). Unlike some other malignancies, high TML was uncommon across HPV+ tumors in general (8%). Conclusions', ' Despite fewer TML high cases among HPV + patients, there was no difference among PDL1 expression. It is possible that a lower threshold may need to be used when determining TML high vs. low in viral-driven cancers. It is also possible that in view of viral immunogenicity, certain genomic alterations contribute more to higher PDL1 expression rather than the sum of total genomic alterations. We are currently pursuing both lines of investigation. These findings are hypothesis generating for future trial design rather than treatment decision-making, and need to be confirmed in large prospective cohorts.']",

Knowledge about the safety and efficacy of ipi+nivo is limited for pts previously treated with PD1. Methods', ' Nine pts were retrospectively evaluated and treated with ipi (3 mg/kg) and nivo (1 mg/kg) q3wk for 4 doses followed by maintenance nivo q2wk after progression on PD1 from 10/2014 to 11/2016. Data regarding clinical history, treatment response, and toxicity were collected. Results', ' Six pts had advanced melanoma, 2 pts had metastatic HNSCC (mHNSCC), and 1 pt had recurrent parotid myoepithelial carcinoma. Age ranged from 44 to 86. Eight pts had ECOG PS 0-1; 1 pt had ECOG PS 2. Three melanoma pts were BRAF+; 1 was BRAF WT and 2 were NRAS+. Both mHNSCC pts were p16+. Pts received a median of 3 prior lines of treatment including chemotherapy and immune treatments encompassing ipi, PD1, 4-1BB agonist, autologous TILs, high-dose IL2, IFN, T-VEC, and TLR8 agonist. All 9 pts received pembro prior to ipi+nivo; 1 pt received both pembro and nivo separately. Median number of PD1 doses prior to ipi+nivo was 10 (range 3-13). All 9 pts received all 4 doses of ipi+nivo without delay. Seven pts received nivo maintenance for median number of 11 cycles (range 1-22). Two pts were unable to receive nivo maintenance due to progressive disease (PD) and instead were treated with ipi+T-VEC and BRAF/MEK inhibition. Objective responses were seen in 6/9 pts (67%) with 2 radiological CRs and 4 radiological PRs. PD was seen in 3/9 pts (33%) including in the 1 pt with ECOG PS 2; all 3 pts died from clinical deterioration unrelated to ipi+nivo treatment. CRs were observed in 1 BRAF+ and 1 NRAS+. 7/9 pts (78%) had 1 clinically significant irAE and 3 of these pts required systemic steroids. Five pts are still receiving maintenance nivo with clinical benefit. One pt with CR was taken off nivo maintenance, remains disease-free, and is now on surveillance. Conclusions', ' Ipi+nivo demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in pts previously treated with PD1. The toxicity profile is consistent with known irAEs. While this is a small series, these data support the use of ipi+nivo after PD1 failure.']",

        "Background":"['OPSCCs commonly arise from the epithelium lining the lingual and palatine tonsillar crypts. The stratified epithelium at the surface gives way to complex reticulated epithelium in the crypts which contain a diverse cell population with varying cytokeratin expression patterns. How such a diverse cell population is maintained has not yet been explored. It has been observed that HPV+ HNSCC consistently arise from the tonsillar crypts. In addition, somatic stem and progenitor cells have been identified as the likely targets of tumorigenesis in many tissues. To further evaluate whether tonsillar crypts contain unique multi-potent stem cells that are targets of tumorigenesis, and similar stem cells are maintained in OPSCC tumors of tonsillar origin, we propose the following studies', ' Aim 1', ' Characterize the cellular populations of crypt epithelium and compare to oral cavity epithelium. Human tissue obtained from the IRB approved EVMS Biorepository will be evaluated. We will stain for purported markers of stem cell activity including LGR5/6, CD34, p63, Bmi-1, cytokeratins 15, 19, and hTert using tyramide signal amplification when necessary. Cytokeratins 5, 8, 14 and 17 (previously identified in subsets of crypt epithelium) will be evaluated and co-stained with the above markers. Ki67 will be used to identify proliferative regions within the crypt epithelium. Aim 2', ' Characterize the cellular population of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and compare to normal tonsillar crypt epithelium. Human tumor obtained from above biorepository will be evaluated. HPV+/- OPSCC cell lines will be quantified for the markers of stem cell activity listed in Aim 1. Similarly, the same markers will be evaluated in HPV+/- human OPSCC tumors and compared to normal tonsil. The cell cycle regulator, p16, which is up-regulated in HPV-induced OPSCC and has previously been identified in a subset of normal tonsillar crypt epithelial cells will also be co-stained with any identified stem cell markers to determine if it is associated with any stem/progenitor cell function. Patient data will be correlated to identify prognostic value of these markers. Aim 3', ' Evaluate clonal expansions of cells in tonsillar crypts and OPSCC tumors by mitochondrial lineage tracing. Acquired deficiencies in the mitochondrial gene for the respiratory chain enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) can be exploited to identify cellular lineages within human tissues and tumors. This aim will evaluate if such CCO deficient (CCO-) clones exist within normal tonsillar crypts and OPSCC tumors, which will allow for careful lineage tracing in future experiments to fully understand the cellular hierarchy underlying tonsillar crypt and OPSCC tumor morphology. Elucidating the cellular hierarchy within tonsillar crypts, and identifying whether multi-potent stem cells exist within the tissue is imperative to understanding OPSCC, including those that are HPV-induced.']",
