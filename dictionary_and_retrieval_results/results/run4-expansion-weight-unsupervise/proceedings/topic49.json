Glioma-derived IDH1 mutations have been shown to dominantly inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity, resulting in increased conversion of 2-hydroglutarate (2-HG) from -ketoglutarate and higher HIF-1 levels. We have previously shown that increased HIF-1 expression in NK-AML samples predicted for poor clinical outcome (Deeb et al Leukemia Research Dec 2010 Epub). Here we examined the IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status of 81 adult NK-AML marrow samples previously characterized for expression of HIF-1 and its downstream target VEGF-A.  Methods', '  Genomic DNA was extracted from marrow mononuclear cells from diagnostic AML samples. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis (PyroMark Q24 Pyrosequencer, Qiagen) performed with custom-designed primers for IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R140 and R172 mutations was used. HIF-1 and VEGF-A expression in AML cells was determined by immunohistochemistry (see Deeb et al, Leukemia Research online 2010) and RQ-PCR analysis.  Results', '  Among these 81 NK-AML samples, 6 (7.4%) contained IDH1-mutations, most in R132H (n=4). Eleven samples (13.6%) contained IDH2-mutations, all in R140Q. IDH1-mutated AML samples expressed higher mean  SEM levels of HIF-1 (3018% vs. 102.7%) and VEGF-A (6214 vs. 283.5%) protein expression and higher HIF-1 gene (6.93.5 vs. 4.00.5 fold) expression than IDH1 wildtype samples. In contrast, IDH2-mutated AML samples expressed no detectable HIF-1 protein and lower VEGF-A protein and HIF-1 gene levels than IDH2 wildtype samples. No differences in age, survival, presenting white blood cell count, or marrow blasts was noted based on IDH1/2 status.  Conclusions', '  Our data suggest a potential association between IDH1 mutations and higher HIF-1 and VEGF-A protein expression in AML cells as compared with IDH1 wild-type cells. These results imply that HIF-1 mediated effects may play a role in the leukemogenic effects of IDH1 (but not IDH2) mutations. How HIF-1 expression impacts on metabolic or oxidative stress responses in IDH1-mutated AML warrants further exploration.']",

        "Background":"['Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioma, and many other cancers. While wild-type IDHs convert isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG), mutant IDHs convert -KG to oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which dysregulates a set of -KG-dependent dioxygenases, such as TETs, histone demethylases, EGLNs, and other enzymes. Because the role of mutant IDH is not necessary for normal cells, inhibitors directed against mutant IDH are expected to have minimum side effects as those of anti-cancer agents.We established a mouse AML model harboring IDH mutations by co-transducing four mutant genes that frequently occur simultaneously in human AML patients. Conditional deletion of the IDH mutant blocked 2HG production and maintenance of leukemia stem cells, resulting in survival of the AML mice. These results indicate that the IDH mutations are critical for the development and maintenance of AML stem cells.Based on these findings, we developed potent and specific inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and tested their effects on the mutant IDH1-dependent AML mouse model, created by introducing four mutant genes including mutant IDH1. The 2HG level was promptly and dramatically decreased in AML cells soon after treatment with the mutant IDH1 inhibitors, and the number of leukemia cells was reduced after a 4-week treatment.To test the effect of the mutant IDH1 inhibitor on glioblastoma, we have established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of glioblastoma carrying IDH1 mutation, and tested the effect of the mutant IDH1 inhibitor on this model. The inhibitor reduced 2HG levels in tumors as well as in plasma. The inhibitor prevented the growth of the tumors with IDH1 mutation. On the other hand, the inhibitor did not affect the growth of the glioblastoma with wild type IDH1. Gene expression analysis identified a set of genes, of which expressions is changed by the IDH1 inhibitor. The most strongly upregulated gene is Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a differentiation marker for astrocytes. Up-regulation of GFAP is confirmed by immune-staining and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. These results suggest that IDH inhibitor induces differentiation of the glioblastoma with IDH1 mutation. We have found that the glioblastoma is transplantable in mouse brain. We are now looking at effects of the inhibitor on this model.Taken together, the results indicate that IDH1 mutant inhibitors are effective for the treatment for AML as well as glioblastoma with IDH1 mutations.']",

        "Background":"['Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) occur in about 15% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and lead to the production of an oncometabolite, the 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Importantly, many clinical studies demonstrated that IDH1/2 mutations are systematically conserved at relapse, suggesting that this mutated enzyme could contribute to early leukemogenesis.In an effort to identify therapy specifically targeting IDH1 R132H mutated blasts, we developed an AML cell line model carrying IDH1 R132H mutation. We first stably transduced HL60 cell line to establish clones carrying either empty vector, IDH1 WT gene or IDH1-R132H mutated gene. We then characterized these clones with different features including 2-HG production.Since demethylation of many genes involved in the retinol metabolism is impaired by IDH1-R132H mutation and because all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a retinol metabolite, is already used in clinic, we studied its effects on IDH1-R132H mutated AML cells.Here, we showed on our transduced models as well as on primary AML patient samples (n=6), that AML blasts harboring IDH1-R132H mutation were highly sensitive to low doses of ATRA, compared to the IDH1 WT. In fact, IDH1-R132H mutation sensitized to ATRA-induced differentiation, as shown by increased expression of the differentiation marker CD11b and morphological changes evidenced with May-Grnwald-Giemsa staining. This was followed by changes of CD14 and CD15 expression, as well as granulocytic enzymatic activity measured with the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay. This terminal granulocytic differentiation came with the reduction of proliferation and colony formation, and then, quickly led to apoptosis of IDH1 R132H mutated AML cells.Moreover, we showed that the level of differentiation of IDH1 R132H mutated models was correlated to the magnitude of IDH1-R132H protein expression and thus to the 2-HG production. We further demonstrated that treatment with a cell-permeable form of 2-HG sensitized empty construct to ATRA-induced differentiation, whereas the inhibition of IDH1-R132H activity reduced its ATRA-sensitivity in IDH1-R132H mutant.Altogether, our results show that IDH1-R132H mutation sensitizes to ATRA-induced granulocytic terminal differentiation in a 2-HG concentration-dependent manner and that it leads to their apoptosis. Since serum 2-HG concentration of IDH mutated patients is approximately 100 fold higher than for non mutated patient, we could expect a high and specific effect of ATRA treatment on IDH1 mutated AML patients. Furthermore, as this mutation could contribute to relapse, this might be a promising therapeutic strategy to achieve a long-term remission in AML with IDH1 mutations.']",

IDH mutations have been associated with a globally hypermethylated genomic state, as the result of increased levels of 2-HG, a regulator of histone methylation. We sought to retrospectively determine responses of patients with IDH-mutated AML to treatment with hypomethylating agents.  Methods', '  We reviewed clinical data for AML patients treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from June 2001 to December 2011 whose stored leukemia samples from bone marrow aspirateshad been tested retrospectively for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. We searched three databases that contained records for 407 AML patients. We selected patients who had been treated with the hypomethylating agents 5-azacitidine or decitabine, alone or in conjunction with other therapeutics. We retrospectively reviewed the patients medical records to obtain demographic, laboratory, treatment, and clinical data. We evaluated response measured by remission status, reduction in bone marrow blasts and peripheral blood blasts, and time to relapse.  Results', '  We identified 104 patients (25.6%) who had either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, and of these, 8 patients had also been treated with hypomethylating agents. A ninth AML patient, who is IDH2-mutant, is currently undergoing treatment with decitabine alone. Of these 9 patients, three had a durable complete remission without recovery of blood counts (CRp), three had a partial response (PR), with or without blood count recovery, and three had no response. All 9 patients did have an initial decrease in the percentage of bone marrow blasts, peripheral blood blasts, or both.  Conclusions', '  This series of patients demonstrates the possibility that AML patients with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations benefit from the use of hypomethylating agents, and suggests it is worthwhile to prospectively investigate treatment of patients with IDH-mutated AML using hypomethylating agents.']",

To explore the involvements of IDH1/2 in the pathogenesis in pediatric hematological malignancies. We analyzed mutations that involve the activation sites of IDH1/2 using polymerase chain reaction amplification/sequencing in a total of 244 samples of pediatric myeloid malignancies as well as infantile leukemia including 17 AML-derived cell lines, 115 primary cases of AML, 28 primary cases of MDS, 15 primary cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), 6 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived cell line, 18 primary cases of CML and 45 infantile leukemia(6 AML and 39 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients). Moreover, to assess whetherIDH1/2 mutations overlap with known gene abnormalities, such as FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1 mutations, mutational analyses of FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1 were also performed. The common IDH2 R140Q mutation was detected in a single AML case, whereas no IDH1 mutation was detected in samples of myeloid malignancies. Although no IDH2 mutation was detected in infantile leukemias, novel P127S, H133I and I130V of IDH1 mutations were detected in 4 of 45 (8.9%) infantile ALL cases. No IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were detected in the JMML, MDS, or CML samples examined. Six AML samples including one cell line had c-KIT mutations (D816V, N822K, or D419fs), 12 AML cases had FLT3-ITD and 10 infantile leukemia cases had FLT3 mutations (D835E or I836). The NPM1 mutation was detected in 2 of 132 AML samples. The AML case harboring the IDH2 mutation, Case 39 was a 12-year-old boy diagnosed as AML-M2 according to the French-American-British cooperative group classification system having t(8;21)(q22;q22), showed no abnormalities of NPM1, c-KIT, and FLT3. Remarkably, among 4 infantile ALL cases with IDH1 mutations, 3 cases showed mixed lineage leukemia(MLL) rearrangements with t(4;11). The FLT3-D835 mutation was found in 1 of 4 patients with IDH1 mutations. These results suggest that although the involvements of IDH1/2 mutations in the pathogenesis of pediatric myeloid malignancies are extremely rare, closely positioned to near activation site, R132 IDH1, these IDH1 mutations are the candidate second genetic events in a subset of MLL-leukemia.']",

IDH1 and IDH2 normally function to convert isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate. However, when these enzymes are mutated at select residues the mutant enzymes now convert -KG into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In normal cells, 2-HG levels are typically extremely low, but IDH1/2 mutant cells can accumulate up to 10 mM 2-HG. In an effort to counteract the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH enzymes, we identified and developed potent inhibitors of IDH1. The compounds inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity in biochemical assays and reduce 2-HG production in IDH1-mutant cell lines. Consistent with the fact that 2-HG inhibits -KG dependent enzymes including histone demethylases and Tet family hydroxylases, these IDH1 inhibitors induce a decrease in several histone methylation marks and also DNA methylation.

Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) are enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG) and the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. Oncogenic mutations in two IDH-encoding genes (IDH1 and IDH2) have been identified in acute myelogenous leukemia, low-grade glioma, and secondary glioblastoma (GBM). Our in silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data combined with wet-bench analysis of tumor extracts indicate that non-mutated IDH1 mRNA and protein is commonly overexpressed in primary GBM. We show that genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of IDH1 decreases GBM cell growth, promotes a more differentiated tumor cell state, increases apoptosis in response to targeted therapies, and prolongs survival of animal subjects bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). On molecular levels, diminished IDH1 activity results in reduced -KG and NADPH production, which is paralleled by deficient metabolic flux from glucose or acetate into lipids, exhaustion of reduced glutathione, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced histone methylation and differentiation marker expression. These findings suggest that IDH1 upregulation represents a common mechanism of metabolic adaptation of GBM to support macromolecular synthesis, aggressive growth, and therapy resistance.']",

Pathway enrichment analysis revealed several pathways involved in tumorigenesis of leukemia and lymphoma, indicating a selective modulation of relevant cancer genes by IDH mutations.

The pathogenesis of AML has not been completely defined; however it is clear that recurrent chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., translocations and numeric abnormalities) and genetic events (e.g., point mutations and indels) are necessary for disease development. Genetic changes are diverse and consist of large genomic changes such as rearrangements and ploidy anomalies, as well as submicroscopic changes, including point mutations and indels. Few studies have correlated cytogenetically detected anomalies with molecularly detected mutations in AML. Here we describe our experience using a hematological next generation sequencing (heme-NGS) panel in conjunction with conventional cytogenetic studies to interrogate diagnostic AML specimens in a routine clinical setting. Next generation sequencing was done using a custom designed amplicon panel and Illumina TruSeq Custom Amplicon (TSCA) capture. Using a customized bioinformatics pipelines we were able to detect single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertion/deletion (indel) to a lower limit of 5% with 100% sensitivity and specificity. 28 genes recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies were examined including targeted regions of NPM1, FLT3, KIT, PTPN11, NRAS, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, DNMT3a, EZH2, PTEN, CEBPA, TP53, WT1, RUNX1, TET2, ATM, BRAF, CBL, MPL, SF3B1, ASXL1, HRAS, KRAS, PHF6, GNAS, ETV6 and MYD88.

Comparison of mutation-positive AML demonstrated more mutations present in cytogenetically normal cases, compared with those with chromosome abnormalities detected. Conversely, in 11 cases no mutations were detected by heme-NGS, with 10/11 of these cases showing recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. In those cases where NGS mutations were identified, comparison of cases with normal (CN-AML) and abnormal (CA-AML) cytogenetic studies demonstrated different mutation frequencies, with more mutations detected in CN-AML. Interestingly, TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in CA-AML and least mutated in CN-AML.

We analyzed pretreatment bone marrow samples from 100 AML patients and 19 control samples of normal blood leukocytes.Results', ' We quantified methylation at 22,576 CpG sites and identified 3004 variable CpG sites with the standard deviation of methylation in AML greater than 20%. Hierarchical clustering of methylation values at these variable sites divided the patients into three clusters. Cluster 1 showed extensive hypomethylation when compared to the remaining AML patients and normal controls. Mutations of DNMT3A in the R882 codon were observed in 8/32 (25%) patients while 2 patients (6%) had an IDH mutation. Cluster 2 had the methylation pattern similar to normal controls. IDH mutations were found in 5/45 (11%) patients. DNMT3A R882 mutations were detected in 3 patients (7%); in two of them they were associated with an IDH mutation. Cluster 3 had the highest proportion of IDH mutations - 7/22 (32%) patients; two of these patients also harbored the DNMT3A R882 mutation. This cluster displayed the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) with hypermethylation at multiple CpG sites. We identified significant hypermethylation at 785 CpG sites (P<0.001, methylation change >20% when compared to Clusters 1 and 2). One third of the hypermethylated sites mapped within 1 kb of gene transcription start sites (TSS). We used DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 to characterize ontology of the genes associated with the hypermethylated sites. We found significant enrichment for negative regulators of transcription.

As there are few in-vivo model systems for IDH-mutated tumors we have created a transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model expressing mutant IDH1. We have chosen the zebrafish as a model because they are transparent (allowing monitoring of the transgene in-vivo) and drug screening assays are straightforward (they are simply added to the aquarium).IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C, mutations found in tumors that both produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) instead of alpha ketoglutarate, were cloned into an expression construct that is driven either by the Nestin or GFAP promoter. IDH1G70D (a loss of function mutation), IDH1wildtype and GFP were used as control. All IDH1 constructs were fused to GFP for visualization. These constructs were injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the one-cell stage.All of our transgenic zebrafish lines remain healthy and produce offspring. Transgene expression was detected in the mid/hindbrain of the central nervous system by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-QPCR. A significant increase in the level of D2HG was observed in all transgenic lines expressing IDH1R132C or IDH1R132H, but not in any of the lines expressing control constructs (IDH1wildtype, IDH1G70D or GFP). In contrast to reported, we failed to detect any differences in hydroxymethyl cytosine (the first step in DNA-demethylation) and mature collagen IV levels between wildtype and mutant IDH1 transgenic fish. We also performed microinjections on fertilized eggs to screen for early developmental effects of IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C. Despite of the high expression of the transgene, no developmental effects were found. Our observations therefore suggest that elevated levels of D2HG are insufficient to initiate tumorigenesis or other phenotypic effects in our fish. Treatment of the transgenic zebrafish with an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AGI-5198, resulted in a reduction in the D2HG level in the mutant zebrafish. The L2HG level was not affected by AGI-5198. As no tumors were formed in our transgenic zebrafish lines, we backcrossed them with Tp53 mutant fish. Analysis of these lines is currently being performed.In summary, we have generated a transgenic zebrafish model system that expresses mutated IDH1 that can be used to study effects of mutant IDH1 (or elevated levels of D2HG) in vivo and can be used for drug screening.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive malignancy of hematopoietic progenitors with poor clinical outcomes. Despite the power of next-generation DNA sequencing to describe AML genomes and to identify recurrent mutations, our fundamental understanding of the genomics of leukemogenesis is incomplete. Founder mutations in the majority of AML cases are unknown because pre-leukemic cells are clinically silent and are outcompeted by their malignant descendants. Our limited knowledge of founder mutations comes from infrequent cases of AML arising secondary to antecedent clonal bone marrow disorders or rare instances of inherited syndromes. Importantly, recent advances in AML stem cell biology now enable the prospective separation of residual non-leukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from AML cells. We previously showed that non-leukemic HSC contain clonal antecedents of AML in patients in long-term remission post-therapy, and have proposed a model in which serial acquisition of mutations occurs in self-renewing HSC. Here, we investigated this model and the nature of founder mutations through the genomic analysis of de novo AML and patient-matched residual non-leukemic HSC. Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations present in eight individual AML genomes (mean 10 mutations per patient) and screened for them in the residual HSC. We identified several mutations present in residual HSC that retained normal multilineage differentiation in vivo. These putative early mutations detected in residual HSC include NPM1c, mutations in TET2, and novel AML mutations in genes involving the cell cycle and mRNA biogenesis. Putative late mutations absent from residual HSC and only found in leukemic cells include FLT3 ITD and IDH1 R132H. Finally, through single cell analysis, we determined that as we hypothesized, a clonal progression of multiple mutations occurs in non-leukemic HSC. Quantitative genetic analyses of the HSC compartment enabled us to reconstruct the subclonal architecture of normal and pre-leukemic stem cells. Consistent with mouse models, pre-leukemic HSC with TET2 mutations outcompeted their normal counterparts. However, in most cases, normal HSC were 6-50 times more numerous than pre-leukemic HSC. In two cases where sequential populations of pre-leukemic HSC were identified, the less mutated pre-leukemic HSC population was 10-25 times more numerous than its more mutated descendent. This result contrasts with the classical model of a linear succession of dominant pre-leukemic subclones. These pre-leukemic HSC reveal the clonal evolution of AML genomes from founder mutations, suggest a potential mechanism contributing to relapse, and constitute a cellular reservoir that may need to be targeted for more durable remissions.']",

        "Background":"['The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) family of enzymes is central to cellular metabolism, catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG) and production of NADPH. Recently, cancer-associated heterozygous somatic mutations in family members IDH1 and IDH2 were discovered and present predominantly in glioblastoma multiforme and acute myeloid leukemia. The major consequence of these point mutations is the biochemical production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2-HG] from -KG. Recent studies indicate that unalike mutations of IDH2 produce different intracellular levels of (R)-2-HG, suggesting that IDH2 mutations may differentially influence tumorigenesis. Contrasting clinical studies find IDH mutations to be associated either with increased metastatic potential, or higher survival and enhanced chemosensitivity probabilities. Nevertheless, these studies failed to indicate specifically which of the various IDH mutations were found in each of the patients tumors. This raises important questions as to whether specific IDH mutations contribute differently to tumorigenesis. In this study, specific IDH2 mutations were evaluated and compared for their chemosensitivity, tumorigenic activity, and production of (R)-2-HG- all notable determinants for their potential use as tumor biomarkers. Three individual clinically relevant IDH2 mutations (IDH2-R172K, -R172M, and -R140Q) or IDH2-WT were expressed in human U87MG glioblastoma cells. We observed distinct changes in cell morphology, proliferation, migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Differences in base-line activation of various stress pathways were also observed, lending a plausible explanation to the differing phenotypic outcomes. Interestingly, the variable levels of endogenous (R)-2-HG produced by the cell panel inversely correlated with their respective growth rates, implicating (R)-2-HG as a negative regulator of tumor growth. Indeed, treatment of tumor cell lines, expressing IDH2-WT, with exogenous (R)-2-HG induced a decrease in cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. When tested in vivo, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with (R)-2-HG significantly reduced tumor volume. These in vivo results complement the results of soft-agar colony forming assays, demonstrating again that (R)-2-HG inhibits tumor growth. In contrast, immortalized cells subjected to long-term (R)-2-HG treatment showed enhanced cell proliferation. Their response to (R)-2-HG, however, could be switched from growth promotion to that of growth inhibition through expression of oncogenic Ras. Thus, these findings demonstrate conclusively that IDH2 mutations are not alike and that oncometabolite (R)-2-HG plays dual roles in tumorigenesis.']",

        "Background":"['Single cell analysis tools are crucial to better understand the role that rare or heterogeneous cancer cells play in the evolution of tumor progression. Although, it is now feasible to perform single-cell RNA-Seq on thousands of, several challenges remain for high-throughput single-cell DNA sequencing. To address these challenges and enable the characterization of genetic diversity in cancer cell populations, we developed a novel approach that barcodes amplified genomic DNA of individual cells confined to microfluidic droplets. The barcodes are used to reassemble the genetic profiles of individual cells from next generation sequencing data. A key feature of our approach is the “two-step” microfluidic workflow that releases genomic DNA from cellular proteins prior to amplification. The microfluidic workflow first encapsulates individual cells in droplets, lyses the cells and prepares the lysate for genomic DNA amplification using proteases. Following this lysate preparation step, the proteases are inactivated and droplets containing the genomes of individual cells are then paired with molecular barcodes and PCR reagents. We demonstrate that the two-step microfluidic approach is vastly superior to workflows without the two-step process for efficient DNA amplification on tens of thousands of individual cells per run with high coverage uniformity and low allelic dropout of targeted genomic regions. To apply our single-cell sequencing technology to the study of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we developed a targeted panel to sequence genes frequently mutated in AML including TP53, DNMT3A, FLT3, NPM1, NRAS, KRAS, JAK2, IDH1 and IDH2. Using this panel, we were able to identify clonal populations from AML research samples; moreover, the single-cell nature of our approach enabled the correlation of multiple mutations within subclones and determination of whether the mutations existed as as a homozygote or heterozygote. Collectively, our results show a greater degree of heterogeneity in AML tumor samples than is commonly appreciated with bulk sequencing methods.']",

Interestingly, A-CIMP was enriched in CEBPA (19%) and WT1 mutations (14%), but inversely correlated with IDH, TET2, and NPM1 mutations. Functional pathway analysis revealed that genes hypermethylated in A-CIMP are associated with pluripotency maintenance - including PAX6, GBX2, and HOXA9 - and RNA-seq data largely, but not entirely, recapitulated methylation-based patterns. There was a strong correlation between promoter CpG island methylation and gene expression for many A-CIMP genes.

        "Background":"['MIR142 mutations have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In AML, all MIR142 mutations localize to the miR-142-3p seed sequence. We show that mutated MIR142 is unable to suppress several well-known targets of miR-142-3p. Interestingly, the mutations of miR-142-3p result in their preferential loading into the RNA-induced silencing complex, leading to the degradation of miR-142-5p. Accordingly, miR-142-5p expression is decreased in MIR142 mutated AML. Hence, MIR142 mutations in AML disrupt both miR-142-3p/5p functions. Thus, we modeled the effect of MIR142 mutations on hematopoiesis using Mir142-/- mice. We show that loss of miR142 results in significant increases in myeloid hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), including granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, myeloid-biased multipotent progenitors (CD150- CD48+ Flk2- Kit+ Sca+ lineage-) and CD229- myeloid-biased HSCs (CD150+ CD48- Kit+ Sca+ lineage-). In contrast, there are significant decreases of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors and erythroid precursors. Although the number of HSCs is normal in Mir142-/- mice, HSC transplantation suggest that they are myeloid-biased. In AML, MIR142 mutations are commonly found in conjunction with mutations of IDH1/2. To assess the importance of this association, we transduced wildtype or Mir142-/- HSPCs with retrovirus expressing IDH2 R172K and then transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. Expression of IDH2 R172K alone was sufficient to induce a lethal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). In contrast, Mir142-/- alone did not result in MPN. However, loss of Mir142 cooperates with IDH2 R172K to produce a more severe MPN, with increased CD34+ blasts and more severe anemia. Moreover, secondary transplantation shows that Mir142-/- x IDH2 R172K cells but not IDH2 R172K cells efficiently engraft and induce MPN, suggesting that loss of miR142 increases leukemia-initiating activity. We identify the histone methyltransferase ASH1L as a target gene of miR142 that contributes to altered hematopoiesis in Mir142-/- mice. The 3’-untranslated region of ASH1L has four miR-142-3p binding sites, and luciferase reporter assay shows that miR142 suppresses its translation by 80%. Consistent with this observation, Ashl1 protein expression is 3-fold higher in Mir142-/- bone marrow. ASH1L is a key positive regulator of HOX gene expression. Accordingly, we observed markedly (5-10 fold) increased HoxA9/A10 expression in myeloid progenitors in Mir142-/- mice. Likewise, HoxA9/A10 expression is increased in CD34+ blasts from Mir142-/- x IDH2 R172K transplanted mice. Of note, increased HoxA9 expression has been shown to cooperate with mutant IDH1 to induce AML in mice. Together, these findings support a model in which loss-of-function mutations of MIR142 contribute to hematopoietic malignancies by derepressing ASH1L and inducing HOXA9/10 gene expression.']",

A number of genes and variants are known to have prognostic/predictive utility in several myeloid malignancies, allowing for more accurate stratification, and enhanced patient management. This has led to consideration of NGS for detection of somatic mutations in myeloid malignancies in the clinical diagnostic setting, to supplant single-gene molecular testing assays in current use. Building on our prior work establishing a novel mass spectrometry-based high throughput mutation detection assay for hematologic malignancies, we investigated the application of NGS to myeloid malignancy diagnostics. To do this, we validated the Illumina TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (54 genes, 568 amplicons) on 71 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patient samples, alongside relevant controls. NGS Libraries were prepared using standard protocols, and sequencing performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Concordance among NGS calls, single gene tests, and Sanger verification was tested as part of the clinical validation process.Analysis of 41 cases tested in our previously developed mass spectrometry assay indicated 100% concordance (70/70) for reportable variants mutually covered in both assays. Single nucleotide variations detectable in lab-standard single gene assays were all found by NGS (100% concordance). 58/71 (82%) cases had at least one additional potentially clinically relevant variant that would not have been identified in the existing assay (mean 1.95 additional variants/case; range 1-9). Additionally, we determined that AMLs carrying IDH1, IDH2 or TET2 mutations had a higher mutation burden (mean 4.6 mutations/case, range 2-7), compared to AMLs wild-type for these three genes (mean 3.1 mutations/case, range 2-4; p = 0.008). Clinically relevant insertions (up to 33 bp) and deletions (up to 52 bp) associated with AML and MPN, including FLT3 ITD and CALR deletions, were detected in known positive cases. In these cases, our analysis was supplemented with a custom bioinformatics algorithm allowing for alignment against an artificial reference sequence to detect larger indels. Due to low coverage of the clinically actionable CEBPA, we supplemented the NGS assay with Sanger sequencing for this locus. Therefore, we report the validation of an NGS panel for high throughput detection of mutations in myeloid malignancies, and the development of a wet-bench and informatics workflow enabling maximal information benefit in the diagnostic setting. This pipeline allows the detection of variants that impact diagnosis and patient management, with significantly improved information benefit over current tests.']",

Mosaic germline mutations such as those affecting RB1, TP53 and AKT1 are important for clinical testing. However, it is challenging to detect mosaic mutation by genome-wide sequencing approaches as a mutant allele present at a low fraction in a germline sample can be caused by either tumor-in-normal contamination or mosaicism. Here we propose a two-step analytical approach to distinguish between these two possibilities. The first involves assessing the level of tumor-in-normal contamination using all clonal somatic mutations identified through the analysis of tumor purity and chromosome ploidy. The second step determines the probability of mosaicism for a candidate variant by calculating the binomial probability of its mutant allele fraction (MAF) under the contamination hypothesis. We applied this process to 1,172 paired tumor-normal pediatric cancer samples analyzed by whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing. Six mosaic variants were identified, including three pathogenic TP53 mutations with a mutant allele fractions (MAF) ranging from 0.2 to 0.3, one RB1 mutation in a retinoblastoma case with a MAF of 0.08, one IDH1 p.R132H mutation in an acute myeloid leukemia case with a MAF of 0.21, and one mosaic RYR2 p.E1690D mutation in an osteosarcoma case with a MAF of 0.11. At the same time, we were able to reject three candidate TP53 variants caused by contamination with MAFs ranging from 0.06 to 0.33. All predicted mosaic mutations were verified by ultra deep sequencing at 10,000X coverage.

Recurrent somatic mutations in the genes encoding for the metabolic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 have recently been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemias, chrondrosarcomas, cholangiocarcinomas and glioblastomas. Point mutations in IDH lead to production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG acts as a potent inhibitor of enzymes involved in the removal of chromatin marks associated with transcriptional repression (DNA and Histone H3K9 methylation). Excess 2HG leads to impaired differentiation but very little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here we use a well established model of cellular differentiation, the differentiation of 10T1/2 fibroblasts into myofibers by the lineage-specifying transcription factor MyoD to study the mechanisms by which IDH mutations impair differentiation. We show that 5-azacytidine induced differentiation of 10T1/2 cells is impaired when mutant IDH2 is expressed and that IDH2 mutations impair the ability of MyoD expression to reprogram 10T1/2 cells into myofibers. We propose that the metabolic landscape of undifferentiated cells determines the ability of the lineage determining factor MyoD to trigger differentiation and that the undifferentiated state of cancer cells is dependent on their unique metabolic profile. Further work aims to a) define the effects of mutant IDH1/2 on the ability of MyoD to program muscle differentiation, b) determine the nature of the tumorigenic effects of IDH1/2 mutations in 10T1/2 cells and c) identify molecular pathways that can overcome differentiation blocks upon activation. Insight from these experiments will outline the mechanism(s) by which metabolic alterations, in the form of 2HG, impair differentiation and drive tumorigenesis. They will also serve as a platform for the identification of metabolic alterations that trigger differentiation.

For each target gene, MutSigCV identifies its bagel, a set of genes predicted to have similar background mutation rates to the target gene and use the bagels to estimate the background mutation rate. Based on the identified bagels, we developed a novel statistical method implementing a series of algorithms to improve the statistical power while maintaining the type-I error rate. First, we developed a statistical framework for testing the selective growth advantage of each mutation type and appropriately integrating evidence of growth advantage across mutation types to achieve robust power. We then extended the algorithm to consider spatial clustering information. This substantially improves the statistical power when non-silent mutations are clustered into a few short regions or nucleotides. We applied this novel method to TCGA melanoma WES including 271 tumor samples. Without modeling spatial clustering information, over 30 candidate driver genes, including BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, PPP6C and CDKN2A were detected controlling FDR=0.01. Modeling spatial information of somatic mutations detected additional rarely mutated genes, including DISP1 (P=1.310-20, involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation that leads to normal development of embryonic structures), IDH1 (P=1.010-8, previously identified in relation to gliobalstoma and acute myeloid leukemia), MAP2K1 (P=510-18, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases that also include BRAF, MEK and other important players in melanoma), INTS8 (P=7.710-15, an integrator of small nuclear RNA processing), and STK19 (P=1.210-10, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, previously identified in melanoma). Finally, we developed methods to simultaneously analyze multiple cancers to improve the power for genes mutated in more than one cancer type, which will be illustrated by analyzing 12 major cancers in TCGA. Our method will provide an important tool for improving driver gene mutation detection in cancer.']",

AG-221 is a first in class, potent, selective, oral inhibitor of mIDH2. In a phase 1 dose-finding/expansion study of AG-221 in 159 pts with mIDH2+ AML relapsed-refractory (R/R) after 1 to 6 prior AML treatment (Tx) regimens, hematologic response rate was 38%, including 18% complete remission rate (Stein, ASH 2015).

        "Background":"['Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is a metabolic enzyme that is frequently mutated in certain cancers, with incidence rates ranging from 7-90% for glioma, chondrosarcoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and AML. Wildtype IDH1 (wtIDH1) catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (KG), while tumor-associated mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) catalyzes a rogue reaction', ' the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from KG. 2-HG therefore represents an oncometabolite that is believed to play a role in cancer by interfering with KG-dependent enzymes, which in turn causes hypermethylation of histones/DNA and a block of normal cellular differentiation. Mutant IDH1 is a driver oncogene and the inhibition of this altered enzyme will decrease the growth of mIDH1 dependent tumors.We report for the first time the preclinical profile and structure of BAY 1436032, a novel selective mIDH1 inhibitor. An optimization program based on a high throughput screening resulted in the identification of the clinical candidate BAY 1436032 for the treatment of mIDH1 dependent cancer. BAY 1436032 is a double-digit nanomolar and selective pan-inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of various IDH1-R132X mutants in vitro and displayed potent inhibition of 2-HG release (nanomolar range) in patient derived and engineered cell lines expressing different IDH1 mutants. In line with the proposed mode of action, a concentration-dependent lowering of 2-HG was observed in vitro accompanied by differentiation and maturation of mIDH1 tumor cells. Furthermore, BAY 1436032 showed a favourable selectivity profile against wtIDH1/2 and a large panel of off-targets in vitro.To the best of our knowledge we were able to show for the first time single agent in vivo efficacy in mIDH1 patient derived glioma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma solid tumor models with this clinical candidate along with monitoring of intratumoral 2-HG levels as a predictive biomarker. The BBB penetration profile of BAY 1436032 is further supported by preclinical data on in vivo brain-plasma ratios.In conclusion, our data provide in vitro and in vivo proof of concept for BAY 1436032 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor of mutant forms of IDH1. The start of a Phase I study with BAY 1436032 is currently in preparation to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor and pharmacodynamic biomarker responses in patients with solid tumors.']",

Somatic mutations in RUNX1 occur in ~10% of AML, especially in older patients with history of radiation or antecedent hematologic disorder.

Methods', ' We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 94 mRUNX1 and 444 wild-type RUNX1 AML patients treated at our institution from 9/2013 to 12/2016. We also determined the pre-clinical efficacy of a targeted therapy against cultured and primary AML cells expressing mRUNX1. Results', ' 67% of mRUNX1 patients were > 65 years of age. Co-occurring mutations with mRUNX1 were ASXL1 (33%), N/KRAS (20%), FLT3 (20%), IDH2 (18%), IDH1 (13%) and TET2 (10%). In patients > 65 years treated with hypomethylating agent-based therapy, the presence or absence of mRUNX1 did not impact response rate (42% vs 46% CR/CRp, p = 0.67), median event-free survival (3.4 vs 4.7 mo, p = 0.82) or overall survival (11.5 vs 9.3 mo, p = 0.97). In mRUNX1 expressing AML OCI-AML5 and MonoMac1 cells, knockdown of RUNX1 by shRNA repressed its targets, e.g., MYC and PU.1, inhibited growth and induced apoptosis. Ex vivo knockdown of RUNX1 abrogated in vivo leukemia initiation by OCI-AML5 cells. After engraftment, inducible shRNA-mediated in vivo knockdown of RUNX1 restored survival of immune-depleted NSG mice engrafted with OCI-AML5 cells. RUNX1 transcription is driven by a super enhancer occupied by the bromodomain extraterminal protein (BETP), BRD4. Accordingly, BRD4 knockdown by shRNA or treatment with the BRD4-inhibitor OTX015 depleted RUNX1 and its targets, and induced apoptosis of AML cells. Treatment of OCI-AML5 cell-engrafted NSG mice with OTX015 (50 mg/Kg/day X 5, for 3 wks) reduced AML burden and improved survival (p < 0.01). Co-treatment with the BETi and BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax or CDK4/6 antagonist palbociclib or decitabine synergistically induced apoptosis of OCI-AML5 and primary AML blasts.

Loss of the insulator function in glioma prompted us to investigate the same interaction in the context of insulator loss with interstitial deletions at 4q12 in eosinophilic leukemias and AML. Methods', ' We tested a total of 72 primers in temperature gradient PCRs, with concentration matched negative controls, using the AML cell lines EOL-1 and HL-60. Products were sequenced in forward and reverse order. Dual label 5FAM-BHQ1-3hydrolysis probe assays, entirely specific for the PCR products, targeted the junction region of the 3C fragments. A reference 3C interaction was used as an internal copy number control for 3C library production. Results', 'EpiSwitch predicted and identified six 3C FIP1L1-PDGFRA interactions in different sequence orientations, within the 3D organization of the PDGFRA locus. The interaction D7 identified by the EpiSwitch qPCR assay was detected reproducibly in EOL-1 cells and glioblastoma tissue using both single step PCR and qPCR. An imatinib-sensitive AML cell line EOL-1 was used as a positive control for qPCR assays. Both AML and glioma cell lines tested positive using the assay as did glioma patient biopsies. The glioblastoma cell line DBTRG-05MG also tested positive for the D7 interaction at a maximum of 8.92 copies per 20 ng of the template. Conclusions', ' We confirmed and characterized, at high resolution, the conformational deregulation of FIP1L1 and PDGFRA in glioma. Additionally, our group detected the interaction in TKI-sensitive leukemia cell lines.

Results', ' The DSRC found 13 of the 27 cases to be consistent with IDH-DS (11.9% of 109 pts). Median time to onset was 30 days (range 7-116). Manifestations of IDH-DS in > 2 pts were dyspnea (n = 10), pyrexia (9), lung infiltrates (8), pleural effusion (5), and kidney injury (3). IDH-DS was effectively managed with systemic corticosteroids in 12/13 cases. Leukocytosis accompanied 4 cases and hydroxyurea was used for cytoreduction.

        "Background":"['Glutamine (Gln) is required for growth and proliferation of several tumor types including AML. Glutaminase (GLS) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes conversion of Gln to glutamate (Glu), which provides carbons for the TCA cycle and regulates redox homeostasis through production of glutathione and NADH. CB-839 is a highly selective, reversible, allosteric inhibitor of GLS. In this study we studied metabolic and cellular consequences of GLS inhibition in AML cells cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions.First, we performed metabolic analysis of HL-60 cells co-cultured with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Consistent with the known mechanism of GLS inhibition, CB-839 caused a rapid and extensive decrease in intracellular Glu in both HL60 and MSC and a corresponding increase in intracellular Gln in both cell types. Unexpectedly, CB-839-treated cells exhibited a rapid increase in intracellular and extracellular concentrations of multiple amino acids, possibly reflecting inhibition of global protein synthesis. CB-839 suppressed Cys consumption from the extracellular compartment and caused rapid increase in intracellular taurine in HL-60 cells, suggesting altered redox homeostasis. CB-839 inhibited cellular growth of HL-60 and MV4;11 AML cells cultured alone or co-cultured with MSC, demonstrating activity under conditions mimicking BM microenvironment.We have previously shown that the leukemic bone marrow microenvironment is highly hypoxic (Benito PLoS One 2011), and hypoxia has been reported to induce production of the L-enantiomer of 2-HG (L-2HG) (Intlekofer Cell Metabolism 2015). In AML cells, hypoxia selectively induced the production of L-2HG (measured by LC-MS/MS) in HL-60 (6.2+/- fold) and OCI-AML3 cells (2.9+/- fold) with wt-IDH. That increase in L-2HG was potently inhibited by CB-839. AML cells produced very little D-2HG, and neither hypoxia nor CB-839 significantly affected D-2HG levels. We recently reported that CB-839 increased hydroxymethylation (hmc) levels using a HELP-GT assay (Velez ASH 2015), and the implications of those observations are the subject of ongoing studies.Prompted by the observation of increased hmc in response to CB-839 treatment, we next examined the efficacy of CB-839 in combination with the DNMT3A inhibitor 5-azacitidine (5-AZA). Treatment with 1M CB-839 and escalating doses of 5-AZA caused additive or synergistic inhibition of cellular growth after 5 days of culture, both under normoxia and hypoxia, in AML cell lines (OCI-AML3, HL-60, MV4;11) and primary AML cells (n = 6).In summary, GLS inhibition causes AML growth arrest by multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of protein synthesis and disruption of redox homeostasis. Gln contributes to hypoxia-induced production of L-2HG and possibly epigenome regulation in AML, and concomitant blockade of GLS by CB-839 and DNMT3A with 5-AZA potently suppresses AML cell growth.']",

For this, we have built the largest and most comprehensive PDX library with full genetic profiles. By far, our PDX library contains over 1,100 models derived from patients of both Asian and Western origins, covering over 20 major cancer types, including large panels (over 100 models each) of NSLCL(1), CRC(2), gastric(3), HCC(4), and pancreatic, and smaller panels (<100) of esophageal, H&N, ovarian, cholangiocarcinoma, breast, brain, etc. Our PDX models come with original patient and pathology diagnosis information, and verified at the level of histopathology and genetic fingerprints.

They are fully profiled using GeneChip based technology (U219, SNP6.0, miRNA), NGS (RNAseq and WES), and hotspot mutation, etc (HuPrime 1.0), with HLA typing readily available to enable immuno-oncology research. Comparing our PDXs genomic profiles with published patient genomic profiles in literature (4) and TCGA data source (Guo et al., 2015 AACR Annual) revealed high degree of similarity. Subsets of models have been comprehensively characterized for special relevance to specific clinical characteristics and specific drug targeting mechanisms (HuPrime 2.0). These subsets include all clinically observed EGFR mutated NSCLC(1, 5, 6); c-MET activation diseases(7); FGFR driven diseases; RET-fusion driven CRC(8); FLT3-LTD driven AML (9), IDH mutated AML(9) and CRC; RSPO-fusion driven CRC; BCL-ABL fusion disease, HER driven gastric and breast cancers, and ALK fusion NSCLC, etc. We have also established numeric drug resistant models to various SOCs of both chemotherapy and target therapies. The resistance could be de novo (1) or induced (10). These resistant models can be great tools to investigate drug resistant mechanisms and approaches to overcome them. Many PDXs can also been tested orthotopically, including liver, brain, colon, pancreatic, ovarian, and breast etc. Models have great metastatic potential have also been identified, enabling study metastatic mechanism and identifying agents to block the metastasis.
