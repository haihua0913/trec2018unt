Signaling through fibroblast growth factors (FGF2, FGF9) and their high-affinity receptor (FGFR1) has recently emerged as a contributing factor in the pathogenesis and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, knowledge of FGFR1 and ligand expression in SCLC is limited.Methods', \" FGFR1 gene copy number, mRNA levels and protein expression were determined by silver in situ hybridization (SISH), mRNA ISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in primary tumors from 78 SCLC patients.

Spearman's correlations were conducted using SAS 9.4.Results\", ' FGFR1 protein expression by IHC demonstrated a significant correlation with FGFR1 gene copy number (p = 0.03) and FGFR1 mRNA levels (p<0.0001). The positivity of FGFR1 mRNA in the SCLC cohort was 21%.

While initially responsive to radiation and chemotherapy, SCLC is characterized by eventual progression and resistance to traditional therapy. We retrospectively analyzed a molecular profiling (MP) database to identify potentially actionable alterations using a multi-platform approach which includes massively parallel sequencing. Experimental Procedures', ' SCLC patient samples were referred to a central CLIA laboratory (Caris Life Sciences, AZ) for MP (immunohistochemistry [IHC] and next generation sequencing [NGS]). Expression of PD1 (MRQ-22, 1+) on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PDL1 (130021, SP142, 2+5%) in tumor cells was performed by IHC. Additional IHC (ERCC1, TOPO1) and NGS on 591 genes was performed on FFPE samples using the Illumina NextSeq platform in a subset of patient samples. All variants were detected with > 99% confidence. Variants are described as follows', ' pathogenic, presumed pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and unclassified variants (excluding SNPs). Results', ' 203 SCLC samples were identified, 48% were females (97) and 52% were males (106). Median age was 65 [range', ' 29-88]. Cancer cells expressed PDL1 in 2.5% of cases (5/203) and PD1+ TILs were detected in 38% (75/197). For comparison, internal PDL1+ in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) was 31% (339/1098). Notable findings from IHC included ERCC1 negative status in 93% (14/15) and TOPO1 + in 70% (14/20). CNV and mutational analysis (NGS) was available for 10 and 22 patients, respectively. Amplifications were found in the following genes', ' CCND3, CRKL, FGF4, FGFR1 and NFKB1A (n = 1, respectively), and CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN2A and FGF3 (n = 2, respectively). As previously reported, the most frequently altered genes were TP53 (73%) and RB1 (68%). Clinically relevant pathogenic or presumed pathogenic variants included', ' EGFR (exon 19 deletion), BRAF (G469A), APC (T1556fs), NF1 (A1610fs, D699fs), NOTCH1 (E473fs, C332Y, G546X) and PTCH1 (N1351fs).

Variants with unknown significance or unclassified variants detected in genes with clinical relevance and of potential interest for targeted therapy in SCLC include', ' DDR2, cMET, RET, FGFR1/3, BRCA2, IGF1R, RICTOR and NTRK1. Conclusion', ' Genomic and molecular characterization of SCLC samples reveals a heterogeneous population. Several potentially actionable targets are identified by NGS. Early reported trial data suggests susceptibility of SCLC to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We observed higher levels of PD1+ TILs, however differences in antibody clones, thresholds or staining localization (tumor cells vs. stromal lymphocytes), may account for the observed overall low PD-L1 expression.

Therefore, targeting FGFRs represents an attractive strategy for development of new cancer therapeutics. However, the lack of suitable models hinders the progress of research on FGFR inhibitors. Here we successfully validated subcutaneous models in several cancer types, in which FGFR is mutant or amplified/overexpressed, such as breast cancer MDA-MB-134 (FGFR1 amplification), gastric cancer SNU-16 (FGFR2 amplification), endometrial cancer AN3CA (FGFR2 N549K/K310R mutation), bladder cancer RT-4 (FGFR3 overexpression) and RT-112 (FGFR3 overexpression), lung cancer NCI-H1581 (FGFR1 amplification), as well as human derived gastric cancer GA114 (FGFR2 amplification).

Good animal models that can faithfully recapitulate the human disease are in great need for pre-clinical studies. Based on the different responses to treatment, lung cancer is divided into two major classes', ' small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Adenocarcinoma (AdC) and squamous cell lung cancer (SqCC) are two major sub-types of NSCLC. We have successfully developed a novel lentiviral gene delivery system to study the initiation and development of all these lung cancers. We used CA2Cre-shp53 lentiviral vector to initiate lung adenocarcinoma in LSL-KrasG12D mice and proved the importance of NF-B/IKK2 pathway in tumor cell proliferation. To search for novel tumor suppressors in lung cancer, we incorporated an shRNA library targeting 5000 cell signal genes into our CA2Cre lentivector and did the screening in the mice. We have identified several dozens of candidates and are validating these genes back in animals. SCLC is the most malignant form of lung cancer with a five-year survival less than 6%. A mouse model with p53/Rb deletions activated by Adeno-Cre has been established in Berns lab. To improve the model and study other genes that are frequently mutated in human SCLC, we designed a single lentiviral vector to deliver oncogenes (L-myc etc.) and shRNAs against tumor suppressors (p53, Rb etc) and successfully initiated SCLC in wild-type mice. Furthermore, we included luciferase or fluorescence protein genes in the same vector to follow tumor growth and metastasis in the live animal. Using this new model, we are now studying the crosstalk of multiple mutations in the SCLC development. SqCC has not been well modeled by genetic approaches. Interestingly, when we gave KrasG12D-shp53 lentiviral vector after lung tissue damage induced by naphthalene, the mice quickly developed squamous tumors in the big bronchi other than adenocarcinomas in the peripheral lung. Kras mutations are actually not common in human SqCC patients, so we are now optimizing the model and see if more relevant genetic changes such FGFR1 amplification can also induce this type of lung cancer in mice. We hope that our unique lentiviral tool can simplify and accelerate the lung cancer study to understand the big signal pathway complex leading to tumorigenesis and metastasis in the lung and search for new therapies for this deadly human disease.']",

However, early clinical trials show that response rate of FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FGFR-TKIs) is 20-30% in patients with FGFR1 amplified lung cancer. To elucidate the reason for de novo resistance to FGFR-TKI, six FGFR1 amplified lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H1581, DMS-114, NCI-H520, NCI-H1703, HCC95, and Calu-3) were analyzed. These cells were confirmed to have FGFR1 amplification by FISH analysis. Cell viability assay showed only 2 of six cell lines, NCI-H1581 and DMS-114, are sensitive to a FGFR-TKI, BGJ-398. Among BGJ-398 insensitive cells, NCI-H1703, HCC95, and Calu-3 cells express low mRNA and protein level of FGFR1 even in the presence of FGFR1 amplification. In addition, while BGJ-398 downregulates ERK phosphorylation in FGFR1 protein expressing cells, the drug had no effect on ERK signaling in BGJ-398 resistant cells with low FGFR1 protein expression. Importantly, other driver oncogenes were found in these BGJ-398 insensitive cell lines. PDGFRa amplification in H1703 cells and HER2 amplification in Calu-3 cells were reported previously. In this study, we have also found ERBB3 ligand NRG1 was overexpressed in HCC95 cells. Knockdown of NRG1 suppressed cell growth and combination of lapatinib with BGJ-398 led to cell death. To further determine whether FGFR1 protein expression is enough for the sensitivity to FGFR-TKIs, lung cancer cell lines were screened to FGFR-TKIs, BGJ-398 and PD-173034. This screen identified that all FGFR-TKI sensitive cell lines harbor FGFR1 amplification with high protein expression. These results suggest FGFR-TKIs should be used to patients harboring both FGFR1 amplification and protein expression. In case tumors with FGFR1 amplification, but expressing low FGFR1 protein, another driver oncogene may coexist and targeting both FGFR1 and these coexisting driver oncogenes are required to treat these tumors.']",

Although SCLC is more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy compared to other types of lung cancer, cure is difficult because of frequent recurrence. Molecular alterations in SCLC include inactivation of TP53 and RB1, high copy number of Myc family, and amplifications of FGFR1 and SOX2. Additionally, achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1), a transcription factor for development of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, is a lineage-dependent oncogene for SCLC. New drugs and molecular targets need to be identified. Previously, we reported nelfinavir (NFV), a HIV protease inhibitor, inhibited proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and human NSCLC xenograft tumors through induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we demonstrate that the effect of NFV in SCLC cells and preclinical treatment studies using SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. NFV inhibited SCLC cell proliferation and induced cell death in vitro. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a marker of the UPR, was rapidly increased, whereas Myc was decreased after 4 hr treatment with NFV. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a role in cellular energy homeostasis, was activated in the early phase of NFV treatment, whereas the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth, was inactivated. NFV inhibited the expression of SOX2, ASCL1 and Aurora B in a cell line- and time-dependent manner. Taken together, NFV had pleiotropic effects against multiple targets during the inhibition of SCLC cell proliferation. In vivo, NFV inhibited growth of SCLC PDX tumors, which correlated with induction of the UPR and decreased expression of ASCL1 and Aurora B. Collectively, these findings show that NFV is highly effective in SCLC in vitro and in vivo, suggesting possible value of incorporating NFV into clinical trials for patients with SCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Patient outcome is dismal and approval of targeted compounds is yet restricted to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histology. In defined subgroups of NSCLC, but also of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), genetically amplified fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is an oncogenic driver and inhibition of the FGFR1 signaling axis exerts potent antitumor effects. The FGFR/PDGFR/VEGFR inhibitor (TKI) nintedanib has recently been approved for second-line treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (AC) and is also being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of SCLC. Despite initial treatment success, tumor recurrence due to acquired drug resistance is anticipated. We therefore aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance development of FGFR1-driven lung cancer against nintedanib.One SCLC line (DMS114) and two NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines (NCI-H1703, NCI-H520) driven by FGFR1 based on gene amplification were selected for nintedanib resistance in vitro. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT and FACS. Intracellular responses to drug exposure were analyzed by qPCR and Western Blot. To compare transcription levels of parental cells with their selected sublines, whole-genome gene expression array was performed. Cross-cytotoxicity profiles were determined by a large-scale anticancer compound screen. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter activity was analyzed by calcein AM efflux- and ATPase assay, intracellular Nintedanib levels were determined by liquid chromatograpy-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).Chronic exposure to the FGFR/PDGFR/VEGFR inhibitor nintedanib led to expression of the ABCB1 multidrug-resistance (MDR) efflux pump in the SCLC cell line DMS114 but not in the NSCLC SCC cell lines NCI-H1703 and NCI-H520. In the nintedanib-selected subline of DMS114 (DMS114/NIN), the FGFR1 signaling axis remained active. Insensitivity of DMS1114/NIN towards Nintedanib was mediated by efflux via ABCB1, revealing Nintedanib as a substrate for this efflux pump. Ponatinib, another non-ABCB1-substrate FGFR inhibitor, retained strong cytotoxic activity. Additionally, DMS114/NIN cells exerted profound and ABCB1-dependent collateral sensitivity against the MDR-selective lanthanum compound KP772.ABCB1 needs to be considered as a factor underlying intrinsic and acquired nintedanib resistance. On one hand, in second-line therapy, chemotherapy-induced MDR might render tumors resistant to Nintedanib. On the other hand, in first-line treatment, high ABCB1 expression in cancer cells or the microvasculature e.g. in clear-cell renal carcinoma or CNS tumors might account for intrinsic Nintedanib resistance. Switching to MDR-selective anticancer compounds or to non-ABCB1-substrate small molecule TKIs in FGFR/PDGFR/VEGFR-driven tumors might be an option to circumvent nintedanib resistance.']",

However, the exact roles of FGF9 in lung epithelial cells remain elusive.Objectives', ' The objective of this study is to clarify the roles of FGF9 in lung epithelial cells.Methods', ' For in vitro experiments, a stable cell line with constitutive expression of FGF9 in MLE12 (a mouse lung alveolar type II cell line transformed by SV40 large T antigen) was established by retroviral infection. The effect of FGF9 on proliferation, colony formation capacity and downstream signaling was evaluated by MTS assay, softagar colony formation assay and Western blotting, respectively. For in vivo experiments, the cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice subcutaneously, and the size of tumor was measured. To evaluate the efficacy of FGFR inhibitors for FGF9-driven lung cancers, AZD4547, selective FGFR inhibitor, was orally administered. For pathological characterization of the tumors, immunohistochemical staining was performed.Fifteen surgically-resected SCLC samples were obtained and the expression of FGF9 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.Results', ' FGF9 has oncogenic ability in vitro and its effect may be exerted by the activation of MAPK pathway through FGFR1 and FGFR3 in MLE12 cells. Unexpectedly, pathological analysis revealed FGF9-driven tumors exhibited SCLC histology. Selective FGFR inhibitor, AZD4547 suppressed tumor growth of FGF9-driven MLE12 tumors. FGF9 is highly expressed in human SCLC samples (67%).Conclusions', ' These results suggest that FGF9 has roles of tumor initiation and progression in lung cancer, especially in SCLC.SCLC which highly expresses FGF9 may be a target of FGFR inhibitors.']",

FGFR1, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the FGFR1 gene in chromosome 8p12 is involved in cell cycle, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. In SCLC, FGF/FGFR pathway is known to induce proliferation, disrupt apoptosis and mediate chemo-resistance. Pharmacologic FGFR inhibition in SCLC reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. We and others have reported high copy number gains (CNG) in cytogenetic bands encoding FGFR1 in SCLC suggesting that FGFR1 may be driver mutation and a potential therapeutic target in SCLC. In this study we further characterize FGFR1 as a therapeutic target in SCLC.Methods', ' Thirteen SCLC cell lines, 16 SCLC patient samples, and 14 SCLC tumors from commercially available tissue microarray (TMA) were screened for copy number alterations using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and focal FGFR1 amplifications using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the cell lines, FGFR1 exons were sequenced from genomic DNA, mRNA expression evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein expression determined semi-quantitatively using western blot. Growth inhibition assays were performed using PD173074, a selective FGFR inhibitor and standard cytotoxic agents (cisplatin and etoposide) to determine the correlation between FGFR1 expression and drug sensitivity.Results', ' CNG was detected in 10/16 (63%) patient samples and in 5/14 (36%) of tumors from TMA (range 4-9 copies per cell). 5/13 (38%) of cell lines demonstrated CNG, but we found no FGFR1 mutations or focal amplifications in SCLC cell lines. FGFR1 mRNA expression did not correlate with CNG and the FGFR1 protein expression was unrelated to the mRNA expression. FGFR1 CNG predicted sensitivity to PD173074 with cell lines carrying higher copy numbers being more sensitive. No such correlation was detected between FGFR1 mRNA expression and PD173074 sensitivity. Higher FGFR1 mRNA expression was associated with etoposide resistance.Conclusion', ' FGFR1 protein expression in SCLC cell lines is unrelated to copy number alterations and mRNA expression. CNG of 8p12 region which encodes FGFR1 predicts sensitivity to PD173074, a selective FGFR inhibitor.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in industrialized countries. In 2010, it is estimated that cancer of the lung and bronchus will be responsible for 157,300 deaths in the US (Jermal et al. 2010). A number of recent publications have reported the genomic amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1) in lung cancer (Weiss et al. 2010; Voortman et al. 2010). Subtype analysis indicates that approximately 22% of squamous non-small cell lung cell carcinomas (NSCLC) and 27-33% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have amplification of the FGFR1 gene. Amplification of the FGFR1 gene in lung cancer cell lines is associated with over-expression of the FGFR1 receptor protein and increased signaling through the FGFR1 pathway resulting in increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. HGS1036 (formerly FP-1039) is a soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human FGFR1 isoform -IIIc linked to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). HGS1036 acts as a ligand trap that sequesters multiple fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family ligands, blocking their ability to bind to and activate multiple FGF receptors. We investigated the preclinical efficacy of HGS1036 in preclinical lung cancer models with genomic FGFR1 amplification as a novel therapeutic strategy. A panel of lung cancer cell lines (n=5) were identified that displayed genomic FGFR1 amplification on chromosome 8. Two of the cell lines, DMS53 and DMS114, were derived from the tumors of patients with SCLC. The other three cell lines, NCI-H1581, NCI-H520 and NCI-H1703, were derived from the tumors of patients with NSCLC. Examination of in vitro drug sensitivity indicated that all 5 cell lines were sensitive to HGS1036. Treatment of NCI-H1581, NCI-H520, NCI-H1703, DMS53 and DMS114 cells with HGS1036 in vitro resulted in a 52%, 71%, 46%, 47% and 82% reduction in cell proliferation, respectively, as determined by CellTiterGlo. Sensitivity to HGS1036 in vitro generally correlated with FGFR1 copy number and total FGFR1 protein expression. HGS1036 treatment of mice bearing FGFR1 amplified lung cancer xenografts resulted in tumor growth inhibition in all five FGFR1-amplified models examined (p=<0.01). The degree of tumor growth inhibition, as assessed by area-under-the-curve analysis, varied from 31-84% depending on the FGFR1 amplified lung model examined. These experiments demonstrate that lung tumor cell lines with genomic FGFR1 amplification can be sensitive to FGF-ligand blockade by HGS1036 and provide preclinical rationale for the clinical study of HGS1036 in the treatment of lung cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a malignant neuroendocrine tumor of the lung accounting for 15% of all lung cancer cases. SCLC is a highly aggressive disease characterized by early metastasis and a high mortality rate of 95%. The standard of care is chemotherapy, which remains largely ineffective due to quick relapse of chemo-resistant tumors. To date, targeted therapies have not been identified for the treatment of SCLC.In order to comprehensively characterize the genomic alterations in this cancer type, we sought for a worldwide collaboration to collect rare surgical specimen of SCLC patients. Thus, we were able to study copy number alterations in 130 cases, and performed whole genome sequencing on over 78 tumor-normal pairs and transcriptome sequencing of at least 62 primary tumors and 16 SCLC cell lines. In a complementary approach we analyzed tumors derived from a murine SCLC model that was established by the conditional inactivation of Rb1 and Trp53 in lung epithelial cells (Meuwissen et al., 2003). We collected copy number alteration data for 20 mouse SCLC cases and performed exome and genome sequencing of at least 8 tumors derived from SCLC mice which additionally harbored a conditional knockout of Rbl2 (Schaffer et al., 2010).Human SCLC tumors comprise large areas of copy number alterations, revealing focal amplifications of MYC transcription factors. In line with this finding recurrent MYCL1 amplifications were also detected in murine SCLC. Human primary tumors were additionally found to harbor focal homozygous deletions of the CDKN2A locus. Furthermore, low frequent amplifications of oncogenes were identified among which therapeutic tractable FGFR1 amplifications were observed in approximately 6% of the cases.The genomic data allowed for the comprehensive characterization of the TP53 and RB1 locus at higher resolution, aiding in the identification of mutations, hemizygous and homozygous deletions, and larger genomic rearrangements. Consequently, lesions of TP53 and RB1 were found to affect both alleles in almost 100% of the cases analyzed. Other TP53 and RB1 family members were also altered in human tumor specimen thus supporting the mouse models for SCLC. In line with previous findings PTEN inactivation was found in 14% of the cases. Furthermore, recurrent mutations were detected in neuroendocrine specific genes and in chromatin and histone modifiers, among which the inactivation of the histone-acyl-transferases CREBBP and EP300 occurred at a frequency of 24%.In summary, as a continuation of our initial pilot study on 29 SCLC exomes (Peifer et al., 2012) this comprehensive large scale genomic analysis provides further insight into the complex genomic architecture of SCLC tumors and substantially improves the resolution to detect genomic alterations. This larger SCLC tumor cohort allows for the identification of low frequent alterations that might play a decisive role in the development and progression of this disease.']",

Using this array we profiled 100 NSCLC samples (45 squamous, 55 non-squamous).  Results', '  Gene expression analysis of the FGFR family in lung cancer showed overexpression by 3X over median levels of FGFR2 and FGFR3 predominantly in squamous subtype (28% and 19% respectively), FGFR4 overexpresion mainly in non-squamous subtype (25%) and FGFR1 overexpression evenly distributed between squamous and non-squamous subtypes (9 %). There were rare instances of joint overexpression of more than one FGFR, FGFR 1 and 2  together (6%), FGFR 1 and 3 together (2%) and FGFR 3 and 4 together (2%).

Conclusions', '   We report for the first time a sensitive and comprehensive FGF and FGFR gene expression analysis of 100 lung cancers.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the world. FGFR receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in tumor cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Activation of the FGFR pathway via FGFR over-expression, and chromosomal amplification and translocation as well as genetic mutation contributes to the tumor progression and the resistance to anti-EGFR and -VEGF treatment in lung cancer. Targeting FGFR pathway is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy for lung cancer. We have discovered and developed a novel, ATP competitive and orally active small molecule inhibitor of FGFR, LY2874455, currently in clinic development. LY2874455 is a potent inhibitor against four FGFRs, and demonstrates a broad-spectrum of anti-tumor activity in a number of tumor xenograft models. In the current study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of LY2874455 in lung tumor cells with or without FGFR1 gene amplification. FGFR1 is known to be amplified in human lung cancer cells NCI-H1581, NCI-H520 and DMS-114, but not in NCI-H460, A549 and NCI-H1299. The mRNA expression levels of FGFR1 are shown to be higher in the FGFR1 amplified cells than those in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Consistent with this, the FGFR1 amplified cells exhibited the much more robust b-FGF-induced phosphorylation of FRS2 and ERK, which are also more sensitive to the inhibition by LY2874455 than that in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Furthermore, the FGFR1 amplified cells exhibit the better responses to the growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by LY2874455 than those in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Therefore, these findings suggest that FGFR1 plays an important role in lung cancer cell growth and survival, and that LY2874455 may provide a promising treatment option for some lung cancer patients whose tumor harbors FGFR1 gene amplification. The in vivo anti-tumor response of LY2874455 is being further investigated in the tumor xenograft models derived from these FGFR1 amplified or non-amplified human lung cancer cells.']",

Estrogen receptor  (ER) is the predominant ER isoform in lung cancer and we have previously shown that high cytoplasmic ER combined with low progesterone receptor (PR) expression is a poor prognostic marker for NSCLC patients. To further elucidate the biological differences between ER high/PR low versus ER low/PR high expressing lung tumors, a mRNA microarray analysis using the Illumina HT-12 V4 Bead Chip platform was performed using RNA extracted from 64 cases. 165 genes were differentially expressed between these two groups at P<001. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) was a highly over-expressed gene associated with ER high tumors (2.1-fold, P<0.004), while the decoy receptor for FGFR ligands, fibroblast growth factor receptor like-1 (FGFR5), was down-regulated (0.54-fold, P<0.0001). Ingenuity Pathway analysis revealed a network among the 165 differentially expressed genes that linked FGFR1 and FGFR5 to the ER. To analyze cross-talk between the FGF and E2 pathways, we determined the FGF/FGFR profile in a panel of three FGFR1 amplified and five non-amplified NSCLC cell lines. FGF2, 3, 10, and 19 were the most highly secreted FGFs in the cell line panel. FGFR1 amplified cells secreted statistically more FGF3, 6 and 10 compared to non-amplified cells. -estradiol (E2) induced secretion of FGF2 in a cell line without FGFR1 amplification. FGFR3 and 5 were ubiquitously expressed across all cell lines while FGFR1, 2 and 4 expression was higher in amplified cell lines. There was no relationship between ER protein expression and FGFR1 amplification status or FGFR1-5 protein expression. Because FGF signaling has been shown to increase stem cell-like phenotypes in breast cancer, we determined basal and E2-stimulated expression of the stem cell markers, SOX2 and OCT4. Basal SOX2 and OCT4 were more highly expressed in FGFR1 amplified cells compared to non-amplified cells. SOX2 and OCT4 protein expression were increased by E2 treatment in FGFR1 non-amplified cells, with lesser effects in FGFR1 amplified H520 cells. SOX2 expression was also down-regulated in lung sections from mice treated with a combination of the anti-estrogen fulvestrant and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. Finally, we have shown that in FGFR1 non-amplified cells, the anti-proliferative effect of a pan-FGFR inhibitor, AZD4547, can be enhanced in the presence of the anti-estrogen fulvestrant. These results suggest that there is an interaction between the estrogen and FGF signaling pathways in lung cancer and provides a rationale for combination treatment of NSCLC tumors. Further characterization of the molecular types of NSCLC that will benefit from joint therapy is warranted. This work was supported by P50 CA090440.']",

The genotyping data showed differences based on disease stage, response to therapy, and smoking status. Patients with limited disease had a higher median number of mutations detected (9 mut/tumor) than patients with extensive disease (5 mut/tumor). Tumors refractory to chemotherapy were more likely to harbor homozygous deletions including on chromosome 3p, while tumors sensitive to chemotherapy had more diversified amplifications, deletions, and mutations.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer remains one of the most lethal and prevalent cancer types within developed nations. Despite recent advances in molecularly-targeted treatment options (epidermal growth factor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors for EGFR mutations and EML4-ALK fusions respectively), there still remains significant therapeutic need, particularly for squamous cell lung cancer. Indeed, further molecular segmentation has been suggested recently through the discovery of frequent genetic amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1) in squamous cell lung clinical samples. Preclinical validation of the tumour cells dependence on FGFR1 signaling in FGFR1-amplified lung cell lines has subsequently been confirmed, both in vitro and in vivo(1). AZD4547 is an orally bioavailable, highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor which competes with ATP for binding to FGF receptors 1, 2 and 3, thereby inhibiting autophosphorylation and downstream signalling(2). This agent is currently in Phase I clinical studies. Cell line derived xenografts have proven utility as models for pharmacological studies (PK/PD) and as efficacy models in cases of oncogene addiction. However, the utility of cell line xenografts is limited by the lack of molecular and cellular heterogeneity. Primary explants offer the promise of better disease models through increased diversity of molecular lesions and the presence of significant stromal cell components. Characterisation of 127 Chinese NSCLC clinical samples using FGFR1 fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis revealed an FGFR1 amplification rate of 13% (6/48) within squamous cell carcinoma. A bank of 26 primary lung explant tumour models were established and characterised - 4 of these harboured genetically amplified FGFR1 and corresponding high level protein expression. In vivo efficacy studies demonstrated rapid, potent and durable tumour regression in these models in response to oral daily dosing of AZD4547 (94-199% tumour growth inhibition after 2-3 weeks dosing of 12 or 25mg/kg AZD4547, all models p=<0.0001), correlating with pharmacodynamic modulation of FGFR signalling. Conversely, more modest anti-tumour efficacy was observed in FGFR1 non-amplified models (normal copy number and low copy gain) - (18% and 45% tumour growth inhibition after 3 weeks daily dosing of 25mg/kg AZD4547, p=0.25 and p=0.02 respectively). These data highlight the potential clinical utility of AZD4547 as a selective agent for the therapeutic treatment of squamous cell lung carcinoma harboring genetic amplification of FGFR1. 1 Weiss et al. 2010 Sci Transl Med.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Failure of treatment is attributed to recurrence, metastasis, and chemotherapeutic resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transcription factor brachyury is a potential regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and plays a role in tumor resistance to conventional antitumor therapies. However, the mechanisms underlining brachyury-induced EMT are unknown. Recent studies have revealed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/ fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling is activated in lung cancer, and suppression of FGFR results in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Here we investigated the role of FGFR signaling, a critical component of mesoderm induction during normal embryogenesis and a regulator of normal brachyury expression, in brachyury-driven lung cancer. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis showed that the chemotherapy-insensitive/metastatic lung cancer cell line H460 and adenocarcinoma tissues in patients had significantly high expressions of brachyury and FGFR1, 3 and 4 compared to the chemotherapy-sensitive/non-metastatic lung cancer cell line H440 and normal tissues adjacent to tumor. To further explore the association between FGFR and brachyury expression and its function, we specifically silenced FGFR using siRNAs for FGFR1, 2, 3 and 4 in H460 cells or overexpressed FGFR1, 3 and 4 in H441 cells. We found that only FGFR1 inhibition led to suppression of brachyury, whereas overexpression of FGFR1 induced brachyury expression, suggesting that brachyury is a potential target of FGFR1. Immunofluorescence staining and RT-PCR showed that silencing of FGFR1 led to inhibitions of brachyury and EMT (an increased epithelial marker E-cadherin expression and decreased mesenchymal biomarker Snail expression) in H460 cells. Overexpression of FGFR1 promoted EMT in H441 cells, but this effect was suppressed by concomitant knockdown of brachyury. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) inhibitor, PD184352, suppressed FGF1-upregulated brachyury and Snail expressions and invasion in H460 cells. PD184352 also inhibited FGFR1 overexpression-induced brachyury expression, EMT and invasion in H440 cells, indicating an important regulatory role of FGFR1 in brachyury-driven EMT through MAPK/ERK. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of brachyury-driven EMT and highlight the FGFR1/MAPK/ERK pathway as a new therapeutic target for brachyury-driven lung cancer.']",

In spite of many studies over the last few years to elucidate this mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, approximately 30% of the mechanisms of acquired resistance are still unknown. Recently autocrine signaling of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) has been demonstrated in NSCLC cell lines. And several studies suggest that the FGF-FGFR autocrine growth pathway could be an important mechanism for intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines with wild-type EGFR. But until now, no report has clarified the role of FGF-FGFR pathway in acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines with sensitive EGFR mutations. We have established a gefitinib-resistant cell line (PC9 GR), by serial exposure of gefitinib to PC9, an originally gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line (PC9 na). We confirmed that these cell lines did not harbor two well-known EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms, the second mutation in the EGFR gene itself, EGFR T790 and the amplification of the MET oncogene. We collected total RNA from both PC9 na and PC9 GR and examined mRNA expression profile, by using cDNA microarray analysis. We found the expressions of FGFR1 and FGF2 were increased in PC9 GR compared to in PC9 na. The growth of PC9 GR cells was inhibited either by PD173074 (inhibitors of FGFRs) or knocking down of FGFR1 or FGF2 by siRNA in combination with gefitinib. FACS analysis revealed that the combination treatment with PD173074 and gefitinib induced apoptosis more efficiently in PC9 GR cells compared to gefitinib alone. PC9 na cells and PC9 GR cells did not show any change in the proportion of apoptotic cells after treatment with PD173074 alone. To further investigate how FGF2-FGFR1 pathway affects resistance to gefitinib in these cell lines, the downstream targets of EGFR signaling including the MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways were examined. In PC9 na cells, the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, and AKT was efficiently inhibited by gefitinib alone. On the other hand, in PC9 GR cells, the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was not efficiently inhibited by gefitinib alone. However, the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK was completely and AKT was less efficiently rescued by gefitinib and PD173074 combination therapy. In conclusion, these data suggest the activation of FGF2-FGFR1 signaling pathway contributes to the gefitinib resistance in PC9 GR. FGF2-FGFR1 pathway will be a therapeutic target for a subset of NSCLC that acquires EGFR-TKI resistance.']",

Methods', ' Molecular profiling using a panel of gene 24 genes was performed by next generation sequencing (NGS) on 158 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 42 colorectal cancers. The genes studied included ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, SRC, JAK3, ERBB4, ERBB2, and SMAD4. In addition, these tumors were studied for the expression of PD-L1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC). PD-L1 expression was performed using standard IHC approach using SP142 clone (Spring Biosciences). Results', ' The level of PD-L1 expression was significantly (P = 0.0005) lower in colorectal cancer as compared with NSCLC. The NSCLC cohort had significantly (P = < 0.0001) more cases with 3 or more genes mutated as compared with colorectal cancer. However, there was no significant difference in TP53 mutation frequency between the two tumor types. There was no correlation between PD-L1 expression and the presence or absence of 3 or more gene mutations in either NSCLC or colorectal cancer.

        "Background":"['The estrogen receptor (ER) promotes cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Since fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are known regulators of stem cell markers in ER positive breast cancer, we investigated whether a link between the estrogen pathway, FGFs, and stem cell markers could be demonstrated in NSCLC animal models, human cells lines and tumor tissue. In the lungs of female FVB/N mice exposed to the tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, NNK, treatment with the anti-estrogen fulvestrant and/or the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole blocked secretion of both FGF2 and FGF9, and reduced expression of the stem cell markers SOX2 and nanog. These effects were observed in the normal airway epilthelium as well as in both lung preneoplasias and lung adenomas. To investigate the effects of β-estradiol (E2), male mice were administered E2 in the drinking water during exposure to NNK for 4 weeks. In this mouse model, the incidence of carcinogen-induced lung preneoplasias increased 1.8-fold (p<0.05) with E2 exposure accompanied by increased expression of FGF2, FGF9, SOX2, and nanog in airway preneoplasias demonstrating a relationship between activation of the FGF pathway in the lungs, expansion of cells with a stem cell phenotype, and promotion of pre-cancerous changes. In FGFR1 normal copy number NSCLC cell lines that express multiple FGFR family members and secrete several FGFs, E2 treatment caused a significant increase (up to 4-fold; p<0.05) in release of FGF2, an effect that was completely blocked by fulvestrant. Treatment with fulvestrant also resulted in a 30% reduction in phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2, the FGFR docking protein. Upon co-inhibition of ER and FGFRs using fulvestrant and the pan-FGFR inhibitor AZD4547, significantly enhanced (p<0.01) anti-proliferative effects were observed in FGFR1 normal copy number NSCLC cells that show low sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors as single agents. In NSCLC xenografts, the combination of AZD4547 (daily 12.5 mg/kg) and fulvestrant (30 mg/kg twice weekly) resulted in a significantly greater inhibition (67-85% decrease; p<0.05) of tumor growth and decreased expression of Ki67 and stem cell markers compared to each single agent treatment. Furthermore, tumor histology appeared more differentiated and up to a 25% decrease in malignant cellularity was observed with combination treatment compared to each single agent treatment. In NSCLC patient tumors, high ERΒ expression correlated with high FGFR1 expression (p<0.001). Taken together, these results suggest that interaction between the ER and FGFR pathways in NSCLC promotes a stem-like state. Combining an FGFR inhibitor with an ER pathway inhibitor could be exploited to increase the efficacy of FGFR inhibitors for NSCLC patients who lack FGFR genetic alterations.

In this study Id1 deficient mice were used to analyze the role of host Id1 in the hepatic colonization of an experimental lung cancer.Methods\", ' Lewis lung carcinoma cells were used for the experimental production of hepatic metastasis via intrasplenic injection of cancer cells in C57BL/6 wild-type and Id1-knockout (KO) mice.

Animals were sacrificed at the time of LM occurrence and total RNA was purified from LM. A microarray gene expression analysis (Affymetrix) with the support of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was performed to evaluate the potential impact of Id1 deficiency on the regulation of genes mediating cancer cell invasion and proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis.Results', ' By week two after cancer cell injection, 70% wild-type and 10% Id1-KO mice had detectable hepatic metastasis by FDG-PET (p=0.02).

        "Background":"['Lung neuroendocrine tumors (LNETs) comprise small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), large-cell neuroendocrine tumors (LCNEC), and pulmonary carcinoids (PCA), and account for 25% of all lung cancer cases. The low 5-year survival rate of the highly aggressive LNETs (SCLC and LCNEC) combined with the lack of an effective treatment, suggest that understanding how these tumors arise and identifying therapeutic targets are unmet needs. We performed genome/exome, and transcriptome sequencing of 29 SCLC (Ref.1), 60 LCNEC, and 45 PCA to better understand their molecular origin and identify altered genes that may offer therapeutic opportunities.In contrast to SCLC and LCNEC, we found that RB1 and TP53 mutations were rare events in PCA suggesting that PCA are not early progenitor lesions of SCLC or LCNEC, but arise through independent mechanisms. Moreover, GSEA analysis showed that genes of the RB1 pathway were downregulated in SCLC but not in PCA. Our data also show that inactivation of chromatin-remodeling genes, specifically genes involved in histone methylation and subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, is sufficient to drive transformation in PCA.In a preliminary analysis of 15 LCNEC (Ref.2) we observed a predominance of mutations typical of SCLC, such as RB1, TP53, and CREBBP/EP300. In this larger series, we additionally found samples with mutations frequent in adenocarcinoma (AD) or squamous (SQ) lung cancer. We could then distinguish two well-defined groups of LCNEC', ' a SCLC-like group, carrying MYCL1 amplifications and mutations in both RB1 and TP53 genes; and an AD/SQ-like group, harbouring CDKN2A deletions, TTF1 amplifications, and frequent mutations in KEAP1 and STK11. Interestingly, RB1, STK11, and KEAP1 mutations happened in an almost mutually exclusive way. These data suggest that LCNEC might represent an evolutionary trunk that can branch to SCLC or AD/SQ, and also that LNETs and non-LNETs are not completely different entities. This is already suggested by the fact that one of the resistance mechanisms of EGFR-mutant adenocarcinomas to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is through trans-differentiation to SCLC (Ref.3).Finally, we also identified new targetable driver genes in SCLC and LCNEC', ' FGFR1 amplifications were observed in 6% and 18% of the cases respectively; PTEN mutations were identified in 10% of the SCLC cases; and interestingly, one of the LCNEC samples (belonging to the SCLC-like group) harboured an activating RFWD2-NTRK1 fusion gene suggesting that fusions affecting NTRK1 may not only be a targetable opportunity for AD (Ref.4) but also for LCNEC and, based on the molecular similarities, also SCLC.(1) Peifer and Fernandez-Cuesta et al.

It exhibits a unique pharmacological profile and demonstrates potent antitumor activity in xenograft models derived from multiple oncology indications. The on-going phase I/II clinical study of lucitanib has demonstrated objective RECIST responses in breast cancer patients with FGF-aberrant (FGFR1 and/or FGF3/4/19 gene amplified) tumors and in oncology indications anticipated to benefit from antiangiogenic agents (e.g. renal cell and thyroid cancer patients).In an attempt to further elucidate the mechanism of action of lucitanib, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of lucitanib in lung cell lines with FGFR1 amplification. The FGFR1 gene is frequently amplified in lung cancer tumors and FGFR1 copy number may provide a patient selection marker for clinical trials of FGFR inhibitors. Lucitanib cytotoxic activity was evaluated and compared to other FGFR inhibitors (Dovitinib, AZD4547 and PD173074) in a panel of 11 lung cancer cell lines characterized for FGFR1/2 gene copy number and FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGF2 mRNA expression level. Lucitanib IC50 values ranged from 0.14 to 23 M; interestingly the two most sensitive cells lines (NCI-H1581 and DMS114) harbored FGFR1 amplification, while cell lines with lower FGFR1 gene copy number (2) displayed a higher drug IC50 value. In order to understand the involvement of FGFR1 inhibition in the antitumor activity of lucitanib, nude mice bearing FGFR1 amplified NCI-H1581 cell xenografts were treated with escalating doses of lucitanib (2.5, 5, 10 and 20mg/kg/day PO) continuously for 30 days. The antitumor activity of lucitanib at the dose of 2.5mg/kg was marginal (tumor volume of treated / control (T/C%) = 46), while at 5, 10 and 20mg/kg the drug was equally very active (T/C% = 24, 21 and 16, respectively). Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assessments were undertaken at the same drug doses employed for the xenograft efficacy experiments in NCI-H1581 tumor bearing mice treated for 12 continuous days. Tumor concentrations of lucitanib, measured by LC-MS/MS, were related to the administered dose and ranged from 0.31-3.68 M and from 0.26-2.52 M at 4 and 24hrs, respectively. Lucitanib drug concentrations were higher in the tumor than in the plasma, with tumor/plasma ratios at 4 and 24 hrs of 2.00.22 and 20.56, respectively.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in the U.S. Despite successes targeting tyrosine kinase drivers such as EGFR and EML4-ALK, identification of patients who will benefit from emerging targeted therapy regimens remains a challenge. This is exemplified by the disappointing results in the recent Phase III evaluation of ornatuzumab in combination with erlotinib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NCT01456324), targeting both MET and EGFR in biomarker-defined patient populations. We have previously shown that proximity ligation assay (PLA) technology can be harnessed to evaluate EGFR pathway activation by annotating the presence of EGFR in complex with its major signaling adaptor GRB2. Presence of these signaling-associated complexes correlates with EGFR activity, reveals erlotinib pharmacodynamics and associates with improved outcomes to EGFR-directed therapies. Here, we show that PLA technology can also be harnessed to assess MET signaling activity in lung cancer. We have found that MET is constitutively associated with GRB2 in MET-amplified lung cancer cell lines and this interaction is abrogated by the MET-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PHA665,752 (MET TKI) as measured by biochemical approaches and PLA. In parallel experiments, siRNA-mediated knockdown of GRB2 and 100nM MET TKI both lead to dramatic reductions in cell viability, indicating that this interaction is critical in MET-driven cells. Conversely, GRB2 knockdown has no effect in MET-amplified H1648 cells which are also completely resistant to MET TKI. In MET-amplified patient-derived xenograft models of lung cancer we observe MET', 'GRB2 complexes in regions that also stain strongly using pMET(Y1234/5) immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, only a subset of regions exhibiting strong staining for total MET by IHC had MET', 'GRB2 complexes or pMET. Surprisingly, we have observed a very low frequency (2%) of lung adenocarcinoma patients (N = 169) with MET', 'GRB2 signaling complexes, even among high MET-expressing tumors, defined by MET IHC. These data suggest that MET', 'GRB2 is critical in the amplified setting, but may be less important in stromal-induced MET signaling. Consistent with this, GRB2 knockdown in non-amplified A549 and H292 cells fails to impair HGF-induced increases in pAKT and pERK. We are currently conducting mass spectrometry experiments to decipher differences between MET complexes in the amplified vs. ligand-stimulating setting and updated results will be presented. We suggest that only a subset of high MET-expressing cells has evidence of MET in complex with GRB2, potentially explaining the relatively low response rates observed with MET-directed therapies in lung cancer. We believe our approach of combining biochemical, PLA and mass spectrometry-based techniques will also be applicable to the development of improved biomarker strategies for newly emerging targets such as FGFR1.']",

Methods', '  Homebrew probes encompassing genomic sequences of EGFR, NXK2-1, PIK3CA, MYC, BRF2, SOX2, PPMID, FGFR1 and the commercial reagent LSI D5S721/D5S23 (Abbott Molecular) were combined in 2-4-target FISH assays to investigate tissue copy number in early stage lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, N=19) and adenocarcinoma (AC, N=20). Logistic regression models were used to estimate predictive discrimination [sensitivity, specificity, area under the ROC curve (AUC)].  Results', ' Copy number gain was largely detected for all markers (mean range 3.39 - PPMID to 4.67 - MYC). Mean copy number of PI3CA, BRF2, SOX2 and FGFR1 were significantly higher in SCC than AC, while NKX2 and MYC were marginally higher in AC than SCC. Gene amplification was detected for all 9 markers, most frequently for SOX2 and FGFR1 (6 and 5 cases) with significant overlap between FGFR1/BRF2 and SOX2/PIK3CA. Based on the AUC results and the existence of targeted inhibitors, the probe set EGFR/FGFR1/MYC/PIK3CA was selected as a candidate for further development as an adjunct to CT screening for early detection. For this selected set,the optimal cutoff based in the linear predictor from logistic regression yields a sensitivity and specificity of 0.85.

The tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) seems to be one of the most prominent targets of this amplification. Thus, small molecules inhibiting FGFRs have been employed to treat FGFR1-amplified squamous cell lung cancer. However, only about 16% of such FGFR1-amplified tumors respond to single agent inhibitor therapy. Several tumors exhibited insufficient tumor shrinkage, compatible with the existence of persistence of inhibitor-resistant tumor cells in the tumor. To investigate the mechanism of FGFR-inhibitor persistence we studied the lung cancer cell lines DMS114 and H1581. Both cell lines demonstrate GI50 values in the nanomolar range upon three different FGFR-inhibitors. However, both cell lines exhibit sustained cell viability within 0.5 to 5 M inhibitor treatment, indicating a subpopulation of persistent cells. We therefore isolated these persistent cells by treating with a high dose of FGFR inhibitors. After 8 to 12 weeks the cells were completely resistant against all FGFR inhibitors tested. Genetic identity with the original cell line was confirmed by fingerprinting. We found that while parental cell lines showed depleted pERK signals, persistent cells were marked by a constant pERK level upon treatment. In H1581 cells, reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was demonstrated by an active RAS-pulldown assay. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed high and focal NRAS amplification and DUSP6 depletion, leading to MAPK-pathway reactivation. Furthermore, retroviral overexpression of wild type RAS-isoforms induced FGFR-inhibitor resistance in parental H1581 cells. In DMS114 we observed MET and IGF-1R activation as possible mechanisms of persistence. Furthermore, co-inhibition of FGFR and MEK was a highly effective combination therapy to treat FGFR-inhibitor persistent cells. This study associates the MAPK-pathway as a key pathway for FGFR-dependent cell lines. Furthermore, these results suggest a beneficial FGFR / MEK combination treatment to avoid the outgrowth of FGFR-inhibitor persistent cells.']",

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and 60% of these have overexpression of wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR), which portends a poor prognosis. In addition, in a recent clinical trial 6 of 12 lung cancer patients whose tumors acquired a resistance-conferring T790M EGFR mutation during treatment with an EGFR TKI reverted to wtEGFR after treatment with Rociletinib/CO-1686, an irreversible EGFR TKI that is selective for the T790M mutant. These data suggest that targeting wtEGFR may improve treatment outcomes; however, to date single agents that target wtEGFR have not been effective in large scale clinical trials and new ways to target wtEGFR in this context are needed. Our laboratory previously identified the MerTK receptor tyrosine kinase as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC and developed MRX-2843 as a novel MerTK-selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with favorable properties for clinical translation. Irrespective of driver oncogene status, treatment with a MerTK inhibitor yields potent anti-tumor effects in NSCLC cell culture models and blocks tumor growth in xenografts of the MerTK-dependent wtEGFR-expressing A549 cell line. In an attempt to more potently block A549 lung cancer cell proliferation, we screened a library of 378 kinase inhibitors that are in various stages of development and identified synergy between MRX-2843 and multiple irreversible EGFR TKIs, including CO-1686 and Osimertinib/AZD-9291. Further, we found that wtEGFR and MerTK were frequently co-expressed and co-immunoprecipitated with each other in NSCLC cancer cell lysates. Synergistic inhibition of cell expansion was observed in a spectrum of NSCLC cell lines with wtEGFR expression treated with the combination therapy, including H1299 (NRAS mutation), H157 (KRAS mutation), H3122 (ALK fusion), and Colo699 (FGFR1 overexpression). On a mechanistic level, combined treatment with 1μM CO-1686 and 100 nM MRX-2843 dramatically inhibited phosphorylation of both MerTK and EGFR and downstream signaling through the PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK pathways, while treatment with equivalent doses of either single agent did not efficiently inhibit MerTK, EGFR or downstream signaling. Additionally, CO-1686 mediated synergistic inhibition of A549 expansion in combination with a PI3K or AKT inhibitor, suggesting a role for PI3K-AKT activation downstream of MerTK contributing to the resistance of wtEGFR NSCLCs to irreversible EGFR TKIs. Taken together, our data provide rationale for a novel strategy for treatment of NSCLC with wtEGFR overexpression by combining MRX-2843 and an irreversible EGFR inhibitor.']",

In order to identify the clinical significance of FGFR family (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4) in SqCC, we performed a clinical study on the FGFR family in patients with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Methods', ' Consecutive 138 NSCLC patients were studied. Gene expressions of FGFR family were evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Intratumoral protein expressions of FGFR1, FGFR2, and Ki-67 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Gene amplifications of FGFR1 and FGFR2 were investigated by FISH. In addition, mutations of EGFR (exon 19-22) and KRAS (exon 1) were also investigated using either PCR-SSCP or PCR-RFLP, confirmed by direct sequencing. Results', ' Among 138 NSCLCs, 91 tumors were adenocarcinoma, 37 tumors were SqCCs, and 10 tumors were other types. Regarding FGFR gene expressions in NSCLCs, The FGFR2 gene expression was significantly higher in NSCLCs with both wild-type EGFR and wild-type KRAS than in NSCLCs with either mutant EGFR or mutant KRAS (P = 0.0012). FGFR2 gene expression was significantly higher in SqCCs than in adenocarcinomas (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the FGFR2 gene expression was the highest among the gene expressions of FGFR family in SqCC. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in FGFR1 gene expression in relation to tumor histology. Regarding FGFR protein expressions in NSCLCs, the intratumoral FGFR2 protein expression significantly correlated with the FGFR2 gene expression (P < 0.0001, r = 0.5492), and the intratumoral FGFR2 protein expression was also significantly higher in SqCCs than in adenocarcinomas (P = 0.0008). Furthermore, the FGFR2 protein expression significantly correlated with Ki-67 proliferation index (P < 0.0001, r = 0.4677). In FISH analysis, FGFR1 gene amplification was detected in 34.3% (12/35) of SqCCs, and FGFR2 gene amplification was detected in 22.9% (8/35) of SqCCs. Furthermore, the Ki-67 proliferation index was significantly higher in SqCCs with FGFR2 gene amplification than in SqCCs without FGFR2 gene amplification (P = 0.0069).

FGFRs belong to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are single-pass transmembrane receptors with extracellular ligand binding domains and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Upon binding of the ligand the kinase domain activates intracellular signaling networks that coordinate cellular processes such as proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration and survival. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of 18 ligands which are able to bind and activate distinct FGFRs. Deregulated FGFR activity, through mutations or translocations, is often associated with oncogenic events. Overexpression of FGFR or FGF may lead to increased cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration or survival, thus making it an interesting target.In this study we optimized a TaqMan qRT-PCR-based approach to evaluate the copy number variation for several FGFRs (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4) and several FGF ligands (FGF1, FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, FGF10, FGF12, and FGF19) on a panel of 23 cell lines. The cell types covered a variety of diseases including bladder, breast, endometrial, gastric, kidney, liver, lymphoma, melanoma, sarcoma, small cell lung carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

We observed in the sensitive (IC50<100nm) and moderately sensitive (IC50 100 nM - 1000 nM) cell lines a co-amplification of FGF receptor and ligand. Two of the most sensitive cell lines to FGFR inhibitor treatments had the greatest amplification of FGFR2 with a copy number value greater than 100.

Genetic heterogeneity in solid tumors is a major research area and therefore its assessment in SCC of the lung is of great relevance.We have examined FGFR1 and SOX2 gene copy number (GCN) in 76 lung SCC by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).

Two independent probe sets were used for each gene analyzed. For inter-patient GCN value comparisons, the tumor results from each patient was normalized against the GCN values derived from FFPE peripheral blood leukocytes control. We also used MLPA technique to study intra-tumor heterogeneity (TH) by analyzing FGFR1 and SOX2 in different tumor areas. In particular, in 4 cases FGFR1 and SOX2 were co-amplified. Also, TH was examined in serial tumor biopsies and/or resections obtained at different points of disease progression in two patients.Of the 76 patients evaluable for FGFR1 and SOX2 GCN, FGFR1 high amplification was detected in 13/76 (17.10%) and low amplification in 7/76 (9.21%).

Amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) occurs in ~20% of SQCLCs; clinical trials of FGFR1 inhibitors for advanced SQCLCs are ongoing. The frequency, clinicopathologic features, and prognosis of FGFR1 amplification in early-stage, resected SQCLCs have been reported but with discrepant results (Kim et al, J Clin Oncol 2012, Heist et al, J Thorac Oncol 2012).  Methods', '    A cohort of histopathologically-defined and clinically-annotated resected SQCLCs was tested for FGFR1 amplification by FISH (Zytovision Dual Color Probe). Amplification was defined by FGFR1 copy number  2.2x CEP8 control copy number and was assessed by two evaluators (MW, LW) who were blinded to clinical results. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as date of resection until relapse, recurrence, or death, whichever occurred first. We assessed association between FGFR1status and clinical features (Fishers exact test) and DFS (long-rank test). Multivariate DFS analysis was performed using Cox regression analysis.  Results', '    63 resected SQCLCs were evaluated. FGFR1 amplification was detected in 16 (24%).

There was no association between FGFR1 amplification and age (p>0.99), sex (p>0.99), smoking status (p=0.32), or stage of disease (p=0.18). 1-year and median DFS in FGFR1-amplified vs non-amplified cases were 86% vs 71% (p=0.022) and not reached vs 2.3 yrs (95% CI 1.1-3.4 yrs), respectively. Multivariate analysis (FGFR1 status, sex, and stage) found FGFR1amplification significantly associated with improved DFS (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.4).     Conclusions', '    In this cohort of resected SQCLCs FGFR1 amplification was associated with improved outcomes. There was no association between FGFR1 status and sex, age, smoking status, or stage.

        "Background":"['African Americans continue to have poorer 5 year survival after a lung cancer diagnosis than whites for reasons that remain to be fully characterized. This disparity remains even with advances in treatments targeting specific driver mutations that have improved outcomes for some patients. Although the relative frequency of these genetic alterations varies in subsets of individuals defined by sex, histologic subtype, smoking history and race, little is known about the occurrence of these mutations in African Americans. In this study, we characterize the spectrum of known driver mutations in 200 African American NSCLC patients and seek to identify novel somatic mutations in this population. Initially, the population was screened using the Sequenom LungCarta panel of 216 mutations in 24 genes known to contain alterations associated with lung cancer, RET and ROS1 fusion gene expression, and amplification of FGFR1. Whole-exome sequencing is being performed on tumors from those patients with no known somatic mutations. Paired normal and tumor DNA/RNA samples are being genotyped to distinguish germline from somatic mutations in both the screening and sequencing phases. Initial screening has been completed on 130 patients, with the remaining 70 underway. The mean age of the patients enrolled is 61.7 years, 58.5% are female, and 8.5% are never smokers. In profiling the first 130 African American patients, we find that only 28% of patients (N = 36) carry a known somatic mutation that is not present in the germline, far lower than the 41% reported in white patients in our previous studies. Of the identified mutations, approximately 23.8% are KRAS and 23.8% are PT53 alterations. The next most frequent somatic alterations are in EGFR (16.7%). The remaining alterations occurred in only 1 or 2 tumors and include EPHA3, ERBB2, FGFR1, MET, NOTCH1, NRAS, NTRK2, PIK3CA, PTEN, RET and STK11. Five percent of patients have tumors with two driver mutations. Half of the tumors carrying 2 driver mutations had concurrent alterations in KRAS and TP53. Patients with known genetic alterations were more likely to be female than patients with no known genetic alterations (p = 0.42), but did not differ in age, smoking status, pack-years, family history of lung cancer, history of COPD, stage at diagnosis or histology. Mutations in EGFR were responsible for the differences by sex. Exome sequencing is complete for the first 48 of the 92 patients with no known somatic mutations. Sequences are being aligned using Novoalign and GATK will be used for variant calling; results will be available soon. Genetic profiling of NSCLC in African Americans has the potential to both identify novel mutations, expanding the list of potential targets for tailored treatments, and aid clinical decision making in African American patients leading to improvements in outcomes.']",

Different methods and cutoff levels to determine FGFR1 amplification have been reported but as yet no consensus has been reached on standard method. The aim of this study is to assess FGFR1 amplification determined by FISH analysis in a set of samples from 101SCC pts and to explore their clinical features.  Methods', '  Tumor samples from 101SCC pts diagnosed at our institution from August 2007 to August 2011 were screened for FGFR1 amplification by FISH using the ZytoLight SPEC FGFR1/CEN8 probe. FGFR1 was considered FISH positive with a ratio > 2.2 and FISH FGFR1 was polysomic with 3 or more signals in 30% of tumor cells, any other result was considered as negative.

FGFR1 has been reported to be amplified in squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as other indications (e.g. breast) and there are several FGFR inhibitors currently in clinical trial. It is therefore essential to develop relevant in vivo models for the development and characterisation of new FGFR agents and/or combination strategies which may prolong benefit and delay the emergence of resistance.METHODS', 'Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models were maintained subcutaneously in vivo in serial passage and their growth monitored by calliper measurements three times weekly; mice were recruited to treatment groups when the mean tumour volume was approximately 200mm3. Response to treatment was evaluated by tumour growth inhibition in response to FGFR inhibitors such as AZD4547 and chemotherapy. Resistance to both chemotherapy (Paclitaxel/Carboplatin) and AZD4547 in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) PDX model, LU6429, was generated in vivo through repeated dosing and the resulting models characterised for their treatment response. Molecular characterisation was carried out by RNA sequencing.RESULTS', ' A number of novel PDX models have been developed which harbour FGFR amplification and mutations including LU6429, a Caucasian NSCLC SCC PDX model which has modest FGFR1 and FGFR2 amplification and responds to FGFR inhibitors. LU6429 PDX tumours (SCC confirmed by IHC) exhibited reproducible sensitivity to AZD4547 (p<0.001) which was maintained in continuous serial passage and following cryogenic storage. FGFR expression and mutational analysis was assessed in nave tumours, tumours following continuous AZD4547 treatment and in the acquired chemo-resistance setting. Other models show differential response to FGFR inhibitors.CONCLUSIONS', ' Pre-clinical models such as LU6429, a novel patient-derived NSCLC SCC xenograft model with moderate FGFR amplification which showed significant sensitivity to the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547, are invaluable in assessing novel agents targeting the FGFR pathway and in the development of new combination strategies which may prevent or overcome resistance.']",

        "Background":"['Treatment of NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations with EGFR TKIs results in anti-tumor responses to therapy, however patients ultimately progress on therapy due to the acquisition of drug resistance. Known mechanisms of resistance include secondary mutations in the EGFR gene (EGFRT790M) or MET gene amplification, however the underlying mechanism of resistance remains to be elucidated in 40-45% of cases. Previous studies provide evidence for an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a subset of cases that is not associated with the known mechanisms of resistance. In this study, we identify 2 models of acquired resistance to erlotinib that are associated with an EMT phenotype and a dependence on autocrine FGF-FGFR signaling for resistance. Evidence for FGFR pathway activation in the erlotinib-resistant cell population included an increase in FGF2, FGFR1 and phospho-FRS2. Inhibition of FGFR signaling using a small molecule kinase inhibitor or FGFR1-Fc neutralization of FGFR1 ligands re-sensitized resistant cells to erlotinib. Re-sensitization was accompanied by an inhibition of downstream signaling. In contrast, inhibition of AXL, a kinase that has recently been identified as an EMT-associated driver of erlotinib resistance in some pre-clinical models, failed to re-sensitize erlotinib-resistant cells. Our findings are consistent with autocrine FGFR pathway activation, as FGF ligand neutralization in the absence of an exogenous source of ligand can re-sensitize cells to erlotinib. Finally, FGFR pathway inhibition suppressed the development of resistance to erlotinib in sensitive parental cells. These data indicate that FGFR activation could potentially serve as a mechanism of acquired resistance to erlotinib in cases associated with an EMT and suggest that combined inhibition of EGFR and FGFR signaling could be beneficial in treating such cases.']",

Unlike lung adenocarcinoma, few targetable genomic events are known drivers of lung SCC, and therefore, therapeutic options are limited for patients with this disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we have analyzed the entire coding sequence of 196 lung SCCs for mutated genes which may be amenable to targeted therapeutics. In the 108 patient samples analyzed to date, we have observed mutations in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) kinase gene in six cases at four sites, or 3% of samples. The observed FGFR3 mutations are present in both the extracellular domain and the kinase domain of the protein, an observation that is consistent with activating mutations in FGFR3 that are known to drive bladder cancer, and in fact, two of the observed mutations are at sites previously observed in bladder cancer. We therefore hypothesized that these mutations are oncogenic and may be driving transformation in a subset of lung SCC patients. Expression of mutated FGFR3 in NIH-3T3 cells led to anchorage-independent colony formation, which was inhibited by treatment with a pan-FGFR inhibitor. A known mechanism of FGFR3 activation is the constitutive dimerization of receptors with mutated extracellular domains via intermolecular disulfide bond formation, and we have observed this phenomenon in our ECD mutants as well. These data suggest that mutations in the FGFR3 gene are sufficient to transform cells. This finding, along with recently published data suggesting that FGFR1 amplification is also able to drive lung SCC development, demonstrates that the FGFR family may be a promising therapeutic target in lung SCC.']",

S49076 is a potent ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of MET, AXL/MER, FGFR1/2/3 currently in phase I clinical trials.Methods', \" We obtained six resistant lines by treating EGFR-mutated, TKI-sensitive PC9 cells with increasing concentrations of gefitinib (GR1-5) or erlotinib (ER). The six resistant cell lines conserved the exon 19 deletion but the T790M resistance mutation only emerged in two (GR1, GR4), which remained sensitive to AZD9291, a third generation EGFR TKI. Six new AZD9291-resistant cell lines were derived from GR1 and GR4 by exposure to increasing concentrations of the inhibitor. Three of the AZD9291 resistant cell lines lost the exon 19 and T790M mutations, one conserved only the sensitizing mutation and two kept both mutations but with the T790M dropping to very low allelic fractions (1% and 0.03%). All resistant cell lines were characterized for AXL, MET, MER, FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression by Q-RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The effects of S49076 on the parental and resistant cell lines were analyzed by MTT, colony formation, basal membrane invasion and migration assays. Western blotting of key signal transduction proteins was used to gain insight in the drug's mechanism of action.Results\", ' AXL overexpression was the most common event related to gefitinib/erlotinib resistance in the panel of cell lines, with T790M mutation, FGFR1 or BCL-2 overexpression and MET activation being less frequent events. Regarding AZD9291 resistance, AXL upregulation was again widespread, with loss of EGFR mutations as the second most frequent event. In proliferation assays, S49076 showed strong antitumor activity against all PC9-derived cell lines with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib or AZD9291) and not carrying the T790M mutation, with IC50 of 0.2-1.2 M and less than 10% surviving cells at 1 M of drug in most cases. In contrast, S49076 was less active against the parental PC9 cells and the T790M positive resistant lines, with more than 50% of surviving cells at 50 M of drug. S49076 also inhibited the anchorage-independent growth and migration of the resistant cell lines. A correlation was found between mRNA and protein levels of AXL and sensitivity to S49076. Also, PARP cleavage and moderate but reproducible inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by S49076 were observed exclusively in the non-T790M resistant cell lines.Conclusions', ' S49076 shows strong activity in preclinical assays against EGFR mutated cell lines resistant to EGFR TKIs not harboring EGFR T790M mutation and overexpressing AXL. A clinical trial of S49076 in non-T790M patients progressing to EGFR TKI and overexpressing AXL or MET has been initiated.']",

Thus we have developed a multiplexed tumor genotyping panel for detecting somatic mutations relevant to molecular targeted therapies for lung cancer. The mutation profile data are communicated to clinicians to assign patients to appropriate therapy and/or clinical trials.Methods', ' Multiplexed tumor genotyping panel was developed to assess 23 mutations in 9 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2), 5 genes amplifications (EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and FGFR2), and 5 fusion genes (EML4-ALK, CD74-ROS1, SLC34A2-ROS1, KIF5B-RET and CCDC6-RET) using pyrosequencing plus capillary electrophoresis, qRT-PCR, and multiplex RT-PCR, respectively. A written informed consent was obtained upfront from all patients enrolled into this study. Surgically resected tissues, tumor biopsies, pleural effusions and/or pericardial effusions from 280 patients were collected between July 2011 and July 2012 and used for tumor genotyping.Results', ' Somatic mutations were detected in 52.9% (148/280) of all patients. The most common mutation detected in this study was EGFR mutation (35.4%, 99) followed by KRAS mutation (10.4%, 29). EGFR L858R (52.5%) and KRAS G12C (44.8%) was the most frequent among EGFR and KRAS mutations, respectively. Other detected mutations were PIK3CA mutation (2.5%), PIK3CA amplification (2.5%), EGFR amplification (2.5%), MET amplification (2.1%), EML4-ALK fusion gene (1.4%), BRAF mutation (1.1%), NRAS mutation (1.1%), HER2 mutation (1.1%), MEK1 mutation (0.7%), AKT1 mutation (0.7%), KIF5B-RET fusion gene (0.4%), CD74-ROS1 fusion gene (0.4%) and FGFR1 amplification (0.4%). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) was administered to 71.9% (41/57) of previously untreated patients who harbor EGFR activating mutations. Among those treated with EGFR-TKIs, simultaneous mutations in other genes with EGFR mutations were detected in 21.9% (9/41). Response rate of EGFR-TKIs in patients with simultaneous mutations (44.4%) was lower than that in patients with EGFR mutation alone (68.8%), suggesting that additional mutations may play some role in evading oncogenic signaling blockade. EGFR mutations were detected less frequently in smokers than in never-smokers (25.1% vs 60.5%, p<0.0001). Meanwhile, KRAS mutations were detected more frequently in smokers than in never-smokers (13.6% vs 2.5%, p=0.0043), which is consistent with previous reports. The majority of patients with never-smoking history harbored targetable somatic mutations compared to those with smoking history (71.6% vs 45.2%, p<0.0001).Conclusions', ' We have established the multiplexed tumor genotyping panel and this should be incorporated into lung cancer clinical practice to facilitate personalized cancer medicine.']",

        "Background":"['Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common subtype of lung cancer and is strongly associated with smoking. In contrast to adenocarcinomas of the lung, SCCs do not significantly harbor epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations or ALK, ROS1 or RET translocations, which are therapeutically tractable. SCC of the lung and SCC of the head and neck region and esophagus not only share risk factors, morphologic features and mechanisms of tumorigenesis but also frequent fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene alterations. In addition, we found that FGFR2 and FGFR3 expression were also altered in patient derived models of SCC of various origins. FGFRs may thus represent viable therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCC.BAY 1163877, an orally available and potent inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, inhibited SCC cell proliferation as well as downstream FGFR signaling in vitro. When applied in vivo, BAY 1163877 was able to reduce growth of a FGFR1-overexpressing lung SCC xenograft model, a FGFR1-overexpressing esophageal SCC xenograft model, and a FGFR3-overexpressing head and neck SCC xenograft model, achieving reductions in tumor growth by 67 to 92% as compared to the vehicle control. BAY 1163877 was very well tolerated in all models performed.These data suggest that selective inhibition of FGFR1 to 3 with BAY 1163877 might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of SCC malignancies.

        "Background":"['FGFR1 amplifications have recently been identified in 22% of squamous non-small cell lung cancers (sqNSCLC) (Weiss et al., Sci Transl Med., 2(62), 2010) and in pre-clinical models this amplification confers sensitivity to FGFR inhibitor induced cell growth arrest and death (Zhang et al., Clin. Can. Res., In press). Ongoing clinical trials of FGFR inhibitors are selecting patients based on FGFR1 amplifications, as determined by FISH. The development of additional biomarker assays to evaluate the expression of FGFRs, FGF ligands and other potential modulators of response to support analysis of clinical tissues is warranted.We validated the Nanostring platform to allow gene expression (mRNA) analysis of 194 genes, including FGFRs and FGF ligands, from one 5m section of formalin fixed paraffin embedded clinical tumor tissue. Intra- and inter-assay variability was low, as was variability between adjacent sections from the same tumor sample. Further validation of a subset of these genes by RT-PCR revealed a good correlation between platforms. A panel of 50 sqNSCLC tumors were analysed for FGFR1 gene amplification by FISH and for gene expression by Nanostring. FGFR1 amplfied tumours were enriched for high FGFR1 mRNA expression (p<0.02) compared to non-amplified samples, although a subset of non-amplified tumours also demonstrated increased FGFR1 mRNA expression. Immunohistochemical analysis, employing an FGFR1 specific antibody, revealed a correlation between FGFR1 mRNA levels and protein expression in these tumors. Nanostring analysis of additional genes on the 8p12 region, revealed that several of these, for example PPAPDC1B, ASH2L, TACC1 and in particular the FGFR1 neighbouring gene WHSC1L1 are highly expressed in FGFR1 amplified tumors (p<0.0001 for WHSC1L1). In contrast, expression of LETM2, located between WHSCL1 and FGFR1, was not significantly increased in amplified tumors.An FGF ligand expression profile was generated for each tumor, showing that a-FGF, b-FGF and FGF7 were the most abundantly expressed ligands in the sqNSCLC samples, with increased b-FGF expression detected in high FGFR1 expressing tumours. The expression of a panel of potential mediators of resistance to FGFR inhibitor therapy such as c-MET, EGFR and IGF1R were also profiled across the samples, revealing differential expression of these factors across each of the tumors and an inverse correlation between FGFR1 expression and ERBB3 expression.Taken together, these data validate the utility of the Nanostring platform for expression analysis of FGFR pathway genes using mRNA isolated from FFPE tumor samples and this platform can be used to assess the level of expression of potential modulators of clinical outcome.']",

Amplification of FGFR1 has been reported to be as high as 22% in lung SCC and 17% in head and neck SCC (HNSCC). FGFRs have been identified as a potential therapeutic target in lung and head and neck cancers. In addition, FGFRs activate multiple pathways involved in the radiation response including RAS/RAF/MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STAT. AZD4547 is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the FGFR family and is currently being investigated in clinical trials. Since a substantial portion of lung cancer and HNSCC patients are treated with radiotherapy, we examined the anti-tumor effects of AZD4547 in combination with radiation in both lung and head and neck cancer model systems. FGFR protein and RNA expression and cell proliferation with AZD4547 were evaluated in 8 lung and 8 head and neck cancer cell lines. Clonogenic survival assays were performed on 4 lung and 4 head and neck cancer cell lines and xenograft experiments were performed on one HNSCC cell line. These cell lines demonstrated varying levels of FGFR1, 2 and 3 protein and RNA expression. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of AZD4547 in these cell lines ranged from 0.05 to 128 uM. Sensitivity to AZD4547 did not correlate directly with protein or RNA expression. In vitro clonogenic survival assays showed limited effects of combining AZD4547 with radiation. However, significant tumor growth delay was observed with the combination of radiation and AZD4547 compared to radiation or drug alone in the SCC1483 FGFR2 expressing HNSCC xenograft model.

In vivo profiling in xenograft models identified tumor FGFR mRNA levels as a predictor of drug efficacy. Anti-tumor efficacy was largely independent of the tumor type surveyed or the FGFR isoform being overexpressed. Preclinical models included a patient-derived squamous head and neck cancer (HNSCC) xenograft (PDx) model overexpressing FGFR3 mRNA, a bladder cancer PDx model overexpressing FGFR2 mRNA, and a squamous esophageal cancer PDx model overexpressing FGFR1 mRNA. Against this background, clinical proof-of-concept was assessed by enrolling patients into the stratified expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study of BAY 1163877 (NCT01976741) based on tumor FGFR1-3 mRNA levels. FGFR1-3 mRNA was quantified in archival or newly obtained FFPE tumor biopsies by RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope, ACD) and digital transcript counting (NanoString). In total, biopsies from > 500 patients were studied for FGFR1-3 mRNA expression levels. Based on preclinical xenograft experiments showing that low to moderate FGFR1-3 mRNA overexpression was not sufficient for a robust drug response, only patients with an RNAscope score of 3 or 4 (range 0-4) or a normalized Nanostring signal of 800 counts were eligible for enrollment. By applying these stringent criteria, FGFR1-3 mRNA positivity was on average observed with a 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence than published data for genetic aberrations of FGFRs in the respective tumor types (including amplifications, translocations, mutations). We further identified FGFR mRNA(+) tumor types in which genetic FGFR aberrations have not been previously reported. FGFR1-3 mRNA positivity ranged from 10% in lung adenocarcinoma to 45% in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC) and 54% in HNSCC. As of August 2016, 57 FGFR mRNA(+) patients were enrolled and treated with BAY 1163877. Six patients experienced a partial remission (PR) by RECIST v1.1 criteria; including an FGFR3 mRNA(+) HNSCC patient without FGFR3 amplification or translocation, an FGFR1 mRNA(+) adenoid cystic carcinoma patient, and an FGFR1 mRNA(+) sqNSCLC patient (both without FGFR1 gene amplification), as well as an FGFR3 mRNA(+) bladder cancer patient without FGFR3 amplification, mutation or translocation. These results suggest that high FGFR1-3 mRNA expression identifies patients sensitive to FGFR inhibition.

Dovitinib treatment resulted in tumor shrinkage in PDXL01, but not in PDXL02-04, which corresponded to responses in LSCC patients enrolled in the clinical trial. The patient, from whom PDXL01 was derived, showed a partial response to dovitinib with progression-free survival of 6 months, whereas the patient, from whom PDXL04 was derived had rapid disease progression within 2 months of treatment. Mutation profiles of F0 and F2 were largely concordant with each other in at least 70% of somatic mutations. The genome-wide copy number alterations were also largely concordant between F0 and F2, suggesting that PDX tumors can successfully represent the genomic features of the tumors from LSCC patients. Notably, mutation in FGFR 1-3 genes was not observed. FGFR1 amplification largely due to arm-level 8p gain was consistently observed, regardless of sensitivity to dovitinib. This finding suggests that FGFR1 amplification may not be a predictor for dovitinib sensitivity. Finally, we compared gene expression between a responder and non-responders. In a Heatmap analysis of the top 50 significantly up- and down-regulated genes, FGFR gene signature including FGF3 and FGF19 was significantly up-regulated in the responder. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified that gene sets, such as FGFR ligand binding and activation and SHC-mediated cascade pathway, were significantly enriched in the responder, highlighting FGFR pathway activation as a key molecular determinant for sensitivity to dovitinib.

        "Background":"['Background', '    NGS approaches to clinical mutation testing reveal previously uncharacterized, or poorly characterized, somatic variants. A major challenge in reporting is categorization of these variants in the absence of formal guidelines. The process is subjective and the potential for variation between molecular pathologists is significant.  Methods', '   To better characterize variation between molecular pathologists we retrospectively reviewed 95 clinical cases sequenced with the Ion Ampliseq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 at ARUP Laboratories. We focused on variants that were reclassified upon re-review by three molecular pathologists.  Results', '   Ninety eight mutations and 31 variants of unknown significance (VUS) were reported in 72 total tumors. There were seven reclassifications (5% of total classifications) in seven different tumors (3 urothelial carcinomas, 1 bladder adenocarcinoma, 1 melanoma, 1 lung carcinoma, and 1 unknown). Most of these were point mutations and involved FGFR1 (x1), FGFR3 (x1), CTNNB1 (x1), RB1 (x1) and PIK3CA (x3). Six of seven were reclassified from mutation to VUS based upon insufficient evidence of oncogenicity.  Conclusions', '   Five of the reclassifications involved actionable genes (FGFR1, FGFR3, and PIK3CA). The original classification of these as mutation was primarily based on in vitro data. A mutation classification implies there is sufficient evidence for an oncogenic change that may be amenable to targeted therapy. In vitro biochemical and cell biologic assays are artificial systems which may not fully recapitulate in vivo tumor behavior. This study emphasizes the subjective nature of variant classification and the need for the development of weighted criteria devised by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. Until then, it is of utmost importance that molecular pathologists develop systematic methods to determine the quality of available data. We propose a simple checklist to optimize the way variants are classified. We suggest that medical oncologists critically scrutinize the classification of variants as they appear in clinical reports.']",

Methods', '  We retrospectively screened 38 female and 40 male pts with SQCLC in China from 2009 to 2012 to determine the prevalence of alterations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, PI3K, PTEN and FGFR1.

        "Background":"['Lucitanib (S 80881, E-3810, CO-3810) is an oral, potent inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (FGFR1-3), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (VEGFR1-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFR-). A Phase 1/2 clinical study (Soria et al., 2014, Ann. Oncol. 25(11)', '2244-51) showed compelling activity of lucitanib in solid tumors and, in particular, a 50% (6 of 12 patients) RECIST partial response rate in breast cancer patients with FGF-aberrant (FGFR1 and/or FGF3/4/19 gene amplified) tumors. On-going clinical studies are further defining the activity of lucitanib in breast (NCT02053636;  NCT02202746) and lung cancer (NCT02109016). FGFR gene translocations (fusions; e.g. FGFR3-TACC3) resulting in constitutively active FGFR signaling and tumor proliferation are observed in a wide variety of cancers (Stransky et al., 2014; Nat. Comm. (5)', '5006), and inhibition of FGFR signaling in FGFR translocated tumors with lucitanib may be a potential new therapeutic strategy. We evaluated the nonclinical activity of lucitanib in FGFR3 translocated models with the hypothesis that the combined blockade of FGFR and VEGFR signaling would be more effective than targeting each receptor tyrosine kinase independently. The in vitro activity of lucitanib was first evaluated in a panel of bladder carcinoma cell lines (n = 8) with and without FGFR3 translocation. Lucitanib preferentially inhibited the growth of cell lines with FGFR3 translocations in 2D and 3D cell culture, with GI50 values of 80-120 nM in a 72-hour cell viability assay, coincident with a reduction in phosphorylated FGFR3 with an IC50 of 60 nM. Minimal activity was observed in five wild-type FGFR3 cell lines (GI50 > 5 M) with the exception of the JMSU1 bladder cell line that is reported to be dependent on FGFR1 signaling for proliferation (Tomlinson et al., 2009, Cancer Res. 69(11)', '4613-20). The anti-tumor activity of lucitanib dosed orally at 20 mg/kg/day was evaluated in three bladder carcinoma cell-line derived xenografts with FGFR3 translocation (RT112/84, RT4 and SW780) and a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of glioblastoma (BN2289; Crown Bioscience) harboring a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion. Administration of lucitanib resulted in significant (p<0.0001) tumor growth inhibition and, in some cases, tumor regression. The anti-tumor activity of lucitanib in these xenograft models was greater than that observed with either sunitinib (VEGFR/PDGFR inhibitor; 40 mg/kg/day) or BGJ398 (FGFR1-4 inhibitor; 20 mg/kg/day). Together, these results provide a strong nonclinical rationale for further exploration of lucitanib in tumors with FGFR translocations in clinical studies.']",

Alterations in FGFR family members including focal amplification of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), mutations in FGFR 2, 3 and 4, translocations involving FGFR 2 and FGFR3, as well as amplification or transcriptional upregulation of various ligand family members have been associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in subsets of various disease settings. A number of agents targeting the FGF signaling axis including small-molecule FGFR targeted agents, with diverse kinase inhibitory and pharmacological profiles, are currently in clinical development.JNJ-42756493 (first disclosure of the structure) has a pharmacological profile that is differentiated from other agents in this class currently under investigation. JNJ-42756493 displays single digit nanomolar FGFR (1, 2, 3 4) tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. JNJ-42756493 inhibited recombinant FGFR kinase activity in vitro and suppressed FGFR signaling and growth in engineered cell lines and tumor cell lines dependent upon deregulated FGFR expression. JNJ-42756493 demonstrated highly specific tumor inhibitory effects in FGFR1-4 dependent cell lines, in vitro cell lines based xenografts and direct patient derived xenografts, with no discernible activity in models that were not dependent on FGFR signaling. JNJ-42756493 showed favorable drug like properties and displayed a high distribution to lung, liver and kidney tissue. JNJ-42756493 was well tolerated at efficacious doses and resulted in potent dose-dependent antitumor activity accompanied by pharmacodynamic modulation of tumor FGFR and downstream pathway components.Data presented here highlights JNJ-42756493 as a novel, highly potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of all four known active FGFR kinase family members with potent antitumor activity against FGFR-dependent tumor models. These data, together with emerging observations from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, position JNJ-42756493 as a differentiated FGFR 1, 2, 3 and 4 kinase inhibitor and support its continued clinical development in lung cancer and other malignancies associated with aberrant FGFR signaling.']",

        "Background":"['Long Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is a soluble pattern recognition receptor expressed by endothelial and immune cells in inflammatory contexts. We have previously demonstrated that PTX3 binds to different members of the FGF family, thus inhibiting their biological activity. The FGF/FGFR system strongly contributes to cancer progression by inducing tumor growth and neovascularization. To date, recombinant PTX3 protein or PTX3-overexpressing tumor cell lines have been exploited to assess the antitumor effects of this natural FGF trap. Here we generated C57BL/6 transgenic mice expressing human (h)PTX3 under the control of the endothelial specific Tie2/Tek transcription regulatory sequences. These animals were used to investigate the impact of PTX3 overexpression by the host stroma on tumor growth, vascularization and metastasis.Transgenic Tie2-hPTX3 mice were generated by cloning the hPTX3 cDNA into the late-generation, self-inactivating lentiviral vector Tie2p/e to obtain the Tie2-hPTX3 lentiviral transfer vectors that were injected into fertilized oocytes. Expression of the transgene was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses of different organs from Tie2-hPTX3 mice that showed increased levels of circulating PTX3 (80-180 ng/ml) when compared to wild type (wt) animals (<1.8 ng/ml). Also, histological analysis confirmed the perivascular accumulation of hPTX3 in transgenic animals. To assess the anti-angiogenic activity of endothelium-derived hPTX3, we performed ex vivo aorta ring and in vivo matrigel plug assays. Both assays revealed a significant inhibition of FGF2-driven angiogenesis in Tie2-hPTX3 mice that maintained their responsiveness to VEGF-A, thus confirming the specificity of the effect. Next, different syngeneic FGF-dependent tumor cell lines, including TRAMP-C2 prostate carcinoma, B16-F10 melanoma and Lewis Lung carcinoma cells, were subcutaneously injected in Tie2-hPTX3 mice. Notably, the growth of all tumor grafts was significantly reduced in Tie2-hPTX3 mice when compared to wt animals. Also, histological analysis of TRAMP-C2 tumors grown in Tie2-hPTX3 mice showed a strong perivascular expression of hPTX3 and a significant reduction of FGFR1 phosphorylation. This was paralleled by a significant decrease of tumor vascularity and tumor cell proliferation whereas no difference in tumor growth was observed for TRAMP-C2 grafts expressing a constitutively activated form of FGFR1. Finally, B16-F10 melanoma and M5076 ovarian sarcoma cells showed a dramatic decrease of their capacity to form experimental metastases in the lung and liver, respectively, after intravenous injection in Tie2-hPTX3 mice.PTX3 is a natural FGF ligand trap. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that the production of PTX3 by the host stroma may exert a dramatic impact on tumor growth, vascularization and metastasis with potential exploitation for the therapy of FGF-dependent tumors.']",

Ten (27%) patients had  Grade 3 AEs, and one dose limiting toxicity of Grade 3 AST/ALT elevation was noted at 12 mg dose. Daily 9 mg continuous dosing was declared the RP2D. Seven (19%) patients had serious AEs, including 1 death, but none were drug-related. Six (16%) patients had dose reductions due to drug-related hyperphosphatemia at 9 and 12 mg. Pharmacokinetics were linear, dose proportional and predictable with a half-life of 50 to 60 hours. Exposure dependent increases in phosphate blood levels were observed at doses up to 9 mg, thereafter reaching a plateau. Also a trend was seen for increase in FGF23 and decrease in PTH. Out of 8 patients enrolled to date with FGFR pathway aberration, we observed 1 partial response in a bladder cancer patient with FGFR3-TACC3 translocation and 1 near complete response in an urothelial cancer of renal pelvis harboring FGFR2 truncation at the RP2D. Four patients (2 lung cancer, 1 chondrosarcoma and 1 breast cancer patients with FGFR1 amplification) had stable disease.

Step 2', ' expansion cohort to to assess safety and clinical activity of ARQ 087 in selected tumor types, including FGFR gene amplification, translocation and mutation. Assessments included tumor molecular status, response by RECIST v.1.1 every 8 weeks (wks), plasma concentrations of FGF19, 21, 23, fasting glucose and phosphate.   Results', '  61pts were treated (dose range 25-425mg QOD or QD) in Step 1; the majority were female (61%), mean age 64 yrs (34 -78). The RP2D was defined as 300 mg QD continuous dosing. Dose-limiting toxicities included increased liver enzymes (reversible Grade (G) 3 AST increase). Common drug-related adverse events (AEs; mostly G  2) were fatigue (53%), elevated LFTs (45%), nausea (45%), vomiting (20%) and diarrhea (20%). Only 2 pts (3%) experienced G1 drug-related hyperphosphatemia. Drug t1/2 was 2-11 days, PK was unaffected by food. FGF 19/21/23 concentrations post-treatment were increased 1.5-6 fold.   Ten pts in Step 1 had confirmed stable disease (SD)  16 wks (adrenocortical [2], endometrial, ovarian, NSCLC, choroidal melanoma, carcinoid, sarcoma [3]). A squamous NSCLC pt with Src amplification had SD (24% tumor reduction) for 32 wks. One adrenocortical carcinoma pt with FGFR1 amplification remains on study > 22 months. Two ongoing pts with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions demonstrated a partial response and SD > 24 wks with 26% decrease in target lesions, respectively.

Currently, there are no approved drugs for patients (pts) with molecularly defined FGF-aberrant (FGFR1 or FGF3/4/19 amplified) tumors.  Methods', '  The first in human 3-part study is evaluating oral lucitanib monotherapy. Part 1 employed a 3+3 ascending cohort design in pts with advanced solid tumors to establish a recommended dose for further study.

Results', '  109 (part 1 n=17; part 2 n=59; part 3 n=33) pts were treated. Median age was 55 yrs [range 34-80]; 59 female; 105 stage IV; 29 breast cancer, 16 colon, 13 thyroid and 51 other tumor. Doses from 5 mg to 30 mg were evaluated with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) dominated by VEGF-inhibition related toxicity at the 30 mg dose level. The most common adverse events (all grades, all cohorts, continuous and intermittent dosing schedules) were hypertension (86%), asthenia (73%) and proteinuria (69%).  Exposure increased with dose and a t1/2 of 25-40 hours, deemed suitable for once daily administration.

Diagnostic accuracy was compared to tumor genotype (including NGS when available) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of cfDNA. Results', ' 94 specimens from 26 pts underwent plasma NGS. Studying 26 baseline specimens, plasma NGS was more sensitive than ddPCR for known EGFR driver mutations (100% vs 88.5%). In 8 pts with pretreatment tumor NGS, 5 of 6 TP53 mutations were detected; one plasma positive/tissue negative result was seen across 36 genes, a PIK3CA mutation (0.6% AF) which was confirmed using ddPCR (99.6% specificity). Quantitative concordance of AF compared to ddPCR was high (R = 0.94). 21 pts had detectable EGFR driver mutations at resistance. Among 6 pts with maintained T790M, 4 acquired C797S and 2 of these additionally acquired low level KRAS mutations (G13D, Q61K).

In 3 pts, a competing resistance mutation (1 KRAS, 2 BRAF) could be detected in plasma NGS pretreatment and reemerged as putative drivers at time of resistance. Conclusions', ' In this retrospective blinded validation, tagged amplicon-based plasma NGS was more sensitive than ddPCR with high specificity and quantitative concordance. In a subset of cases, serial plasma NGS can detect emergence of competing resistance mutations, creating an opportunity for the study of osimertinib-based targeted therapy combinations.']",

MPM, a disease with significant unmet needs, overexpresses FGF2 ligand, which binds FGFR1 and promotes tumor cell growth. FP-1039/GSK3052230 is a soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human FGFR1c linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1, and acts as a ligand trap for FGFs. Methods', ' This multi-arm, open-label phase 1b study evaluated GSK3052230 (IV weekly) in combination with 1st-line paclitaxel+carboplatin (Arm A) or > 2nd-line docetaxel (Arm B) in FGFR1 gene-amplified metastatic squamous NSCLC and with 1st-line pemetrexed+cisplatin in untreated, unresectable MPM (Arm C). Each arm involved dose escalation until MTD/MFD followed by a cohort expansion phase. Endpoints include safety, response rates, PFS, duration of response, and translational measures.

        "Background":"['There is increasing evidence that FGFR signaling plays an important role within human cancer, with members of FGFR family acting as driving oncogenes in a significant number of human tumors. Deregulation of FGFR-signaling has been documented within clinical samples of breast multiple myeloma, bladder, endometrial, gastric, squamous NSCLC and prostate cancers. This dysregulation most frequently occurs through gene amplification, or through genetically altered forms of FGFR proteins. This increasing body of evidence implicating FGFR signaling in cancer has provided rationale for the identification and testing of selective inhibitors of FGFR signaling in the clinic. In this presentation, we describe the progress of our FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor programme and report the discovery of N-(5-pyrazolyl)benzamide FGFR inhibitors. Early compounds in this series suffered from poor in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. The key site of metabolism was identified to be at a basic N-methyl group. This group was shown to be located in the solvent channel of the ATP binding site on binding to FGFR1, and modification could be made without causing major changes to intrinsic binding affinity. However, the first compounds identified with low metabolic clearance also showed a significant reduction in oral bioavailability, due to apparent low permeability and increased efflux potential. The characterization of these PK issues and the discovery of compounds which overcame them, through modulation of pKa, lipophilicity and masking of the polar groups, will be described. Leading compounds showed significant anti-tumor activity in xenograft tumors grown in mice. Detailed characterization of these compounds led to the identification of AZD4547, a potent and selective FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently in Phase I clinical studies.']",
