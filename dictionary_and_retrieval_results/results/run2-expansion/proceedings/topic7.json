        "Background":"['Epigenetic changes in cancer are thought to contribute to regulation of invasion and metastasis. To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma with the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enriched by LM-PCR) assay and compared it to melanocyte controls. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions demonstrated that demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. Parallel transcriptomic analysis revealed many known and novel oncogenic pathways aberrantly expressed and regulated by loss of DNA methylation.The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by immunohistochemistry on primary tumors and by Western blotting in BRAF V600E mutant and WT melanoma cell lines. Expression of its ligand IL34, but not of CSF1 was also shown in the melanoma cells by both ELISA and qPCR. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in traditional and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma.Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and lead to rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. In Western blotting experiments, the rebound of ERK phosphorylation after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of the CSF1R ligands CSF1 and IL34, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing CSF1R shRNA recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the CSF1R protein, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression as resistance was acquired. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, is in clinical trials for breast and other cancers, and these data present a preclinical rationale for its study in malignant melanoma.']",

While several genetic resistance effectors have been identified, a comprehensive assessment of the genetic resistance spectrum in a large patient cohort may further inform resistance patterns and treatment strategies.  Methods', '  Pre-treatment and post-relapse biopsies were obtained from BRAFV600melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib or dabrafenib. Whole exome sequencing of tumor and normal samples was performed to identify exome-wide mutations, insertion/deletions, and chromosomal copy number alterations. Since somatic allelic fraction comparisons across treatment time points must account for variable stromal admixture between biopsies, novel algorithms were applied to impute purity and tumor cell ploidy, thus determining the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of each alteration. Those with enriched CCF in post-relapse samples were nominated as potential resistance effectors.  Results', '  30 patients (towards a goal of 77) were sequenced to a mean depth of 145-fold coverage. In acquired resistance patients (on drug  12 weeks, n=18), NRAS Q61R (28%) and BRAF amplifications (6%) were observed. The remaining patients had multiple clonally enriched alterations in the post-relapse tumors that may drive resistance, including MEK1 mutations at residues previously noted in an in vitro mutagenesis screen for vemurafenib resistance. In the intrinsic resistance cohort (on drug < 12 weeks, n=12), multiple putative resistance mutations not previously observed in the setting of acquired resistance were identified.  Conclusions', '  In addition to reported genetic resistance mechanisms, we identified new MEK1 mutations in resistant samples. For the majority of patients (67%) without events in these genes, computational algorithms identified new candidate drivers of RAF inhibitor resistance. Alterations that predict intrinsic or acquired resistance may also inform new approaches to melanoma therapy.

Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples. In future experiments we plan to test clinical samples from patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and we hypothesize that HGF, NRG1, and FGF2 signaling is elevated in patients with poor initial responses or relapse to BRAF or MEK inhibitors.']",

In this study we evaluated the potential of a probe-based, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to quantitatively measure copies of DNA encoding the mutant BRAFV600E and wild-type alleles in the plasma of patients undergoing treatment with a BRAF inhibitor. We previously showed this assay to be 100% specific with a sensitivity to detect 1 mutant copy among 10,000 wild-type copies when sufficient input DNA was used.Methods', ' Ten patients with BRAF-mutant stage IV melanoma were prospectively studied. At least 3 serially-collected plasma samples were available for each patient, corresponding to pre-treatment, best treatment response, and progression of disease as evidenced by PET/CT scan. DNA was extracted from plasma samples and concentrations were measured using a Qubit fluorometer. The relevant BRAF region was assayed using 24 to a maximum of 337 ng of DNA from each sample, using multiple replicate wells for dilute samples to maximize the probability of detecting BRAF mutant copies. Specific Taqman 5 hydrolysis probes for wild-type and mutant BRAF were employed along with common primers to measure the number of copies of each amplicon/reaction. The amount of amplifiable DNA was measured using RPP30 as a control gene.Results', ' All 10 patients had partial responses. We analyzed 35 plasma samples, of which 30 had a minimum of 4ml of plasma. Qubit-based DNA concentrations ranged from 6.9 to 1158 ng/ml. All samples yielded positive amplification of the BRAF and RPP30 amplicons. Total BRAF DNA concentrations ranged from 719 to 156,920 copies/ml plasma. Mutant BRAF DNA concentrations ranged from 0 to 13,028 copies/ml. The fraction of BRAFV600E amplicons ranged from 0 to 45%, with a minimal detected mutant fraction of 0.01%. In 8/10 patients, levels of mutant BRAF fell with clinical response and/or rose with disease progression. In 3 of these 8 patients, samples drawn 10 days to 2 months prior to imaging studies showed increased levels of BRAF mutant DNA prior to evidence of disease progression. In 1 of the remaining 2 patients levels of total BRAF DNA tracked with clinical outcome better than levels of mutant BRAF DNA. In 1/10 patients neither levels of mutant nor total BRAF DNA tracked with clinical responses.Conclusions', ' These results demonstrate that a ddPCR assay is able to quantitatively measure total and mutant BRAF DNA in the plasma of patients with stage IV melanoma. Levels of mutant and total BRAF DNA tracked with disease progression showing promise for this assay as a potential biomarker that may predict disease progression. Analyses of additional tumor-derived mutations in plasma DNA, and more precise assessments of disease response, are underway to determine optimal biomarkers to incorporate into melanoma clinical trial and patient care protocols.']",

Blood samples were collected at baseline (BL), C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C4D1, and off-study. Level of mutant BRAF RNA in circulating tumor cells isolated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed by RT-PCR.   Results', '  Twenty pts were evaluable for response.

Three groups of patients were identified and compared with respect to patient and disease characteristics', ' a) BRAF negative; b) BRAF V600E/K positive; c) BRAF non-V600E/K positive. Results', ' BRAF testing was performed in 168 melanoma patients of which 101 (60%) were BRAF negative; 55 (33%) were BRAF V600E/K positive; 12 (7%) were BRAF non-V600E/K positive (2 G466E, 1 of each G469E, K601N, K601E, L597Q, L597S, V741I, N594G, D594N, V600R and 1 with both K601N & V600E).

Manipulation of key epigenetic regulators, including inhibition of Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family members impairs cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in different cancers, including melanoma. BET inhibition is thought to impair downstream transcriptional activity of the MAPK (MAPK) pathway and other key oncogenic signaling pathways, suggesting complementarity with MAPK inhibition. Here, we investigated the effect of combining the BET inhibitor JQ1 with the BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib in in vitro and in vivo models of BRAF-mutant melanoma. We additionally screened potential synergism of JQ-1 with 27 additional compounds including inhibitors of the proteasome, histone deacetylases (HDACi) and MEK.Methods', ' We performed cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays, and a xenograft mouse model to determine the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of JQ1 in combination with Vemurafenib against BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. Further, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of this combined treatment, we conducted antibody arrays of in vitro drug-treated cell lines and RNA sequencing of drug-treated xenograft tumors. Synergism between JQ1 and other targeted compounds was examined by in vitro cytotoxicity assays.Results', ' The combination of JQ1 and Vemurafenib acted synergistically in BRAF-mutant cell lines. Additional combinations that were found synergistic included JQ-1 plus proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and marizomib, HDAC inhibitors (romidepsin and panobinostat), or anti-Bcl2 small molecules (Obatoclax and TW-37). The combination of JQ-1 and Vemurafenib resulted in marked apoptosis in vitro, with up-regulation of several pro-apoptotic proteins involved in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. In vivo, this combination treatment suppressed tumor growth and significantly improved survival compared to either drug alone. RNA sequencing of tumor tissues revealed almost four thousand genes that were uniquely modulated by the combination. Furthermore, several anti-apoptotic genes such as MCL-1, BCL-XL and BCL-2 were significantly down-regulated.Conclusions', ' Collectively, our data provide a rationale for combinations of BET inhibitors with additional compounds including BRAF inhibitors, as a novel strategy for the treatment of melanoma.']",

However, the primary tumor is often no longer available and metastases not always reflect the characteristics of the primary tumor. In melanoma it is not clear at what stage epithelial antigen is expressed. CETCs are present in peripheral blood in a significant proportion of patients with malignant melanoma. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether these cells belong to melanoma clone due to the presence of the BRAF gene mutation in these cells. For this reason, the analysis of multiple isolated CETCs from individual patients for BRAF gene mutations was performed.  Methods', ' Blood from patients with malignant melanoma was analyzed for cells positive for the EpCAM and Melan-A using the maintrac approach, avoiding cell selection and using an image analysis system for detection. Subsequently, between 8-20 EpCAM and Melan-A positive cells from each patient were isolated individually using a semi-automated capillary approach and deposited one by one into micro cups. The DNA of individual cells was amplified by whole genome amplification and assayed using the cobas BRAF V600 mutation test.

In advanced stage or metastatic patients under Vemurafenib therapy, we were not able to find mutated CETCs.  Conclusions', ' Individually isolated CETCs from the peripheral blood from patients with melanoma allow not only to detect mutations but also to determine the frequency of mutated cells.

However, responses are not durable suggesting activation of alternative tumour survival mechanisms that allow resistance to therapy.This work investigates the metabolic consequences of treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF mutant human melanoma cells that could potentially enable resistance to treatment.Materials and Methods', ' BRAFV600D WM266.4 human melanoma cells were treated with 2M vemurafenib (5xGI50) for 24h in standard culture media. Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy to assess the levels of the aqueous metabolites. The areas of the NMR resonances were analysed using a multivariate method (Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis, PLS-DA) as well as targeted analysis in which metabolite levels were normalized to cell number and an internal standard.Target inhibition was confirmed by western blotting for P-MEK1/2 and P-ERK1/2 protein levels while treatment-induced changes in metabolic enzyme expression were assessed by qRT-PCR and western-blotting.Results', ' As expected, exposure to vemurafenib led to a fall in P-MEK1/2 and P-ERK1/2 levels, consistent with BRAF inhibition. PLS-DA analyses revealed a good separation of control and treated 1H NMR spectra (correlation coefficient, R2 = 100%, predicted variation, Q2 = 96.5%) mainly based on differences in lactate, myo-inositol, glycine and acetate. This correlated well with the values obtained after targeted analysis of the 1H NMR spectra, which showed a significant reduction in intracellular lactate (to 629%) and acetate (to 629%), and an increase in glycine (to18962%,) and myo-inositol (to 25125%) in vemurafenib-treated cells relative to controls (p0.03). These changes are consistent with inhibition of the glycolytic pathway, confirmed by a reduction in hexokinase II and lactate dehydrogenase A expression, both detected by qRT-PCR and western-blotting. qRT-PCR also detected a fall in phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase expression indicating reduced flux to serine-glycine synthesis and suggesting that glycine accumulation may be due to decreased utilization. Reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 expression was also observed indicating enhanced TCA cycle activity.Conclusions', ' Our data show that BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib affects various metabolic pathways in BRAF mutant human melanoma cells inducing a shift in cellular energetic profile that may enable survival following treatment.']",

BRAF is part of the MAPK signaling pathway and the V600E mutation of BRAF confers full activation of this survival pathway. Several clinical trials are being conducted using mutated BRAF as a target but so far, all this trials works during a certain moment but soon, melanoma cells becomes resistant to treatment by activating some survival pathways that can continues the signal initialized in the MAPK pathway. Our objective is to evaluate if the combination of BRAF inhibitors and CDKs inhibitors can suppress the acquired resistance of V600E melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitors. Two melanoma cell lines were used in this study. The SKMel 28 cell line, which has BRAF V600E mutation, and the SKMel 02, which is wild type to BRAF. Olomoucine and Roscovitine were the CDKs inhibitors used in this study, while PLX-4720 was BRAF inhibitor. Western blot and Real time PCR were used to verify some survival pathways, like the MAP3K8 and the PRKD3 pathway, that are overexpressed after BRAF inhibition and MTT assay was used to verify cell viability with both treatments combined. The combination of Olomoucine and PLX-4720 or Roscovitine and PLX-4720 could sensitize the BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell line SKMel 28, but not the BRAF wild type melanoma cell line SKMel 02. Two survival pathways (MAP3K8 and PRKD3) which are activated after BRAF inhibition by PLX-4720 were downregulated in the presence of the CDKs inhibitors in the SKMel 28 melanoma cell line. Also, the retinoblastoma protein was not phosphorylated when the SKMel28 melanoma cell line was treated with the BRAF inhibitor together with the CDKs. The treatment with the BRAF inhibitor and the CDKs inhibitors can sensitize BRAF V600E melanoma cells by decreasing cell viability, downregulation of survival pathways induced by the BRAF inhibitor and preventing Rb phosphorylation. This strategy may overcome the acquired resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma after treatment with its inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"[\"Targeted inhibition of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway has received much attention after the transient success of the BRaf inhibitor, vemurafenib, in metastatic melanoma patients with the BRafV600E mutation. Approximately 50% of melanomas have an activating mutation to BRaf which drives cancer cell proliferation and survival through the ERK pathway. Therapies targeting BRaf or its downstream kinase MEK1/2 have demonstrated very promising initial clinical results. However, these treatments invariably lead to drug resistance through the activation of alternate pathways or mutations that circumvent the blockade and reactivate ERK1/2. Current efforts are centered on the use of combination therapies as well as the direct inhibition of ERK1/2 itself. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of putative substrate-selective ERK inhibitors in various clinically relevant models of drug resistance. Specifically melanoma cell lines resistant to BRaf and MEK inhibitors, PLX-4032 and AZD-6244 respectively, were generated to test the efficacy of these novel compounds in cell viability assays. Furthermore, the potency of these molecules was evaluated in the context of activating mutations to MEK1 and drug resistant cell lines that overexpress MAP3K8 (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2). The data shows that these putative substrate-selective ERK inhibitors preferentially inhibit proliferation of cell lines with activated ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, these novel molecularly targeted therapies are equipotent in drug resistant versus non-resistant melanoma cells. Given these compounds' selectivity for BRaf mutated melanoma cells and their efficacy in drug resistance models, we submit these novel chemical entities as potential lead candidates for new salvage therapies in patients who have become resistant to currently available treatments. Moreover, these ATP-independent inhibitors target only select ERK1/2 functions and may be inherently less susceptible to developing their own drug resistance as compared to complete ablation of all ERK1/2 signaling as seen with ATP-competitive inhibitors.\"]",

While durable resistance is mediated frequently by stable alterations intrinsic to the tumor cells leading to ERK1/2 pathway reactivation, the compensatory activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) modulates the level of initial response. The composition of the tumor microenvironment likely plays a key role in these compensatory/adaptive responses to targeted inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrate that NRG1 is expressed in fibroblasts, as well as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from a mutant BRAF melanoma. Fibroblast derived-NRG1 was able to mediate the enhanced ErbB3 pathway activation in RAF-inhibited mutant BRAF melanoma cells. Furthermore, conditioned medium from fibroblasts and CAFs limits RAF inhibitor cytotoxicity in V600 BRAF-harboring melanomas. Importantly, ErbB3 and ErbB2 targeting antibodies partially reverse the protective effects of fibroblast-derived medium on ErbB3 pathway activation and cell growth properties of mutant BRAF-inhibited melanoma cells. Together, these data demonstrate a requirement for a paracrine-produced factor in the tumor microenvironment to promote resistance to RAF inhibitor in mutant BRAF melanoma and reinforce the idea that targeting ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling may improve the efficacy of RAF inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadliest type of skin cancer due to its high propensity to metastasize. Despite current progress in the identification of promising drugs for treating melanoma, drug resistance has emerged as a serious issue indicating that novel therapeutic strategies may be required. It is well documented that the process of converting the epithelial tumorigenic cell to a mesenchymal phenotype, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is responsible for conferring an invasive phenotype to cancer cells. An EMT-like process has been shown to occur during melanoma progression. High-mobility-protein AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is a multi-function transcription factor linked to oncogenesis and EMT in a variety of cancers. HMGA2 is a small DNA-binding protein with three “AT-hook” DNA-binding motifs that specifically recognize the minor groove of AT-rich DNA sequences. HMGA2 is significantly upregulated in human primary melanoma and metastases, including those with BRAF mutations. We accessed the potential application of netropsin, a potent inhibitor of HMGA2-DNA interactions, as an EMT blocking agent of BRAF mutated melanoma cells. Three murine melanoma cells lines that carry mutations in the BRAF gene and show resistance to vemurafenib (D4M, YUMM1.1, and YUMM1.7) were used. Cells were treated with EMT Inducing Media Supplement along with Netropsin and the expression of E-cadherin as well as their migratory behavior were evaluated. Netropsin treatment of EMT induced cells was not cytotoxic, prevented changes in cell morphology, maintained high levels of E-cadherin expression and decreased migratory behavior. All three cell lines express HMGA2 which continues to be expressed in the tumors resulting from subcutaneous injections in mice. YUMM1.1 cells showed the highest levels of expression of HMGA2 amongst the three cell lines. Interestingly, in our preliminary study only YUMM1.1-derived tumors generated overt metastasis in the lung 30 days after the injections. Altogether our data showed that Netropsin is capable of blocking EMT of murine BRAF mutated melanoma cells. The results of this study will contribute to the development of strategies to prevent EMT that may result in the implementation of more effective therapies to treat melanoma.']",

Research studies have shown that Eph receptors and ligands may be involved in many diseases including cancer. EphA2 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is highly expressed in many aggressive cancer types, including melanoma. Our previous studies showed that EphA2 levels are elevated in melanoma cells and EphA2 plays critical roles in melanoma cell survival, proliferation, colony formation and migration in vitro and melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Together, these data suggest that EphA2 is a critical oncogene in melanoma and a potential pharmacologic target in the treatment of metastatic disease. Herein we present early evidence that EphA2 inhibitors (ALW-II-41-27 and HG-6-64-1) are effective in inhibiting proliferation of both NRAS and BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro through suppressing a series of EphA2 downstream signaling pathways. At the same time, EphA2 inhibitors are also effective at suppressing migration and invasion of melanoma cells with a reduction in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and lamellipodia formation. Animal studies are underway to determine the effectiveness of these agents in suppressing melanoma tumor growth in vivo.

Results', ' 135 (1.2%) of the mBC featured alterations in BRAF. The median age of the 135 female patients was 66 years (range 27 to 83 years).

Mice bearing G361 tet-HGF xenografts, with or without doxycycline, were treated and monitored as described above. A follow up study was performed in G361 tet-HGF xenografts to measure the ability of AMG 337 (20 mg/kg, BID, PO), a selective MET inhibitor, to attenuate the HGF mediated rescue of BRAF inhibition. To monitor effects on the PI3K and MAPK pathways, pAKT and pERK levels were measured in tumors. Plasma and tumor HGF levels were also measured.Results', ' Systemic expression of HGF via AAV-HGF treatment failed to rescue G361 xenografts from the growth inhibitory effects of C1. In contrast, local doxycycline-induced expression of HGF in mice harboring G361 tet-HGF xenografts conveyed significant (p<0.001) rescue of tumor growth, suggesting that local HGF expression may be required to mediate BRAF inhibitor resistance. Elevated pAKT and pERK levels were detected in HGF rescued tumors, suggesting that PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways play a role in conveying HGF mediated resistance. Combined treatment with AMG 337 prevented the HGF mediated rescue of BRAF inhibition, confirming the role of MET signaling in this rescue mechanism. Plasma HGF levels in mice from the systemic HGF expression groups exceeded those in the local groups (3,049 and 195 pg/mL). However, tumor HGF levels were higher in the local expression groups compared to the systemic groups (26,400 and 477 pg/mL).Conclusion', ' Here we demonstrate the role for HGF/MET signaling in mediating resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma and suggest that monitoring HGF levels may be of clinical utility for predicting response to BRAF inhibition and in defining the opportunity for combination therapy with MET inhibitors.']",

Cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma using the QIAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid (Qiagen). We evaluated 3 technologies ', ' 2 assays based on allele-specific PCR, the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen) and the ctBRAF Mutation Detection Kit (Entrogen), and a digital PCR platform, the QuantStudio 3D system (Life Technologies). Results', ' Using the Therascreen assay, we were able to detect a BRAF mutation in plasma of 28/38 patients, yielding a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 73.7% when compared with tumor as the reference sample. Similar results were obtained using the Entrogen assay, with a PPA of 68.4% (26/38). The 2 most common activating mutations, V600E and V600K, had a similar PPA with both Qiagen and Entrogen tests. For all patients with wild type BRAF tumors, the research was negative on plasma DNA with both techniques (negative percent agreement, NPA = 100%). The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA = 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions', ' The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills. The unexpectedly low PPA of dPCR was attributed to the limited amount of DNA extracted from some samples.

        "Background":"['Melanoma can adapt to several stress factors, such as TNF treatment, by changing its phenotype from a highly differentiated (MITF and MART-1 positive) to undifferentiated (neural crest markers) states. We studied this phenomenon as a mechanism of adaptive resistance to BRAF inhibition since melanomas with both MITF high and low have been reported to result in BRAF inhibitor resistance. We treated 17 BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib for short term (3 days) or long term (17 days), and compared them to no treatment or TNF treated conditions. We profiled them phenotypically for MART1 antigen (differentiated phenotype) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR, neural crest phenotype) expression by flow cytometry. Results comparing median fluorescence intensity (MFI) showed a wide spectrum of adaptive responses to short term BRAF inhibition, followed by solidification or further evolution of these changes upon long term exposure and development of drug tolerance. According to each cell line distribution, we calculated a (x,y) value that organized the cell lines and conditions in four quadrants according to MART1 (x axis) or NGFR (y axis) expression. Two double negative (MART1-/NGFR-) cell lines that were unaffected by treatment and stayed in the same quadrant. Seven MART1-/NGFR+ and four MART1+/NGFR- cell lines slightly changed phenotype with vemurafenib exposure but stayed in the same quadrant. Four cell lines with MART1+/NGFR+ phenotype were greatly influenced by treatment, showing wide plasticity with cells shifting towards NGFR+/MART1- and others towards NGFR-/MART1+. Changes in position between baseline and tolerance to vemurafenib after 17days treatment were numerically quantified as an inferred number from plasticity. Cell lines with double positive (MART1+/NGFR+) phenotype had a significant change in plasticity compared to the rest of cell lines in other quadrants (p = 0.0004). This arranges cells in a four-quadrant pattern that could be likened to a U-turn toward de-differentiation. Cells that de-differentiated with BRAF inhibition mimicked the effect induced by TNF. This effect was driven by a decrease in MITF activity confirmed with a tyrosinase promoter-luciferase assay. In conclusion, baseline melanoma differentiation phenotypes guide the phenotype switch response, with those double positive for differentiation and neural crest markers being at a semi-stable state that can be prone to different plastic changes upon BRAF inhibition.']",

This is especially true for BRAF inhibitors, were multiple mechanisms of resistance have been uncovered. However, the lack of dependable models to develop approaches to overcome resistance, poses a real challenge for clinical decisions on second line therapies. In addition, combination therapies necessary to achieve long term responses increase the number of possibilities to be assessed. In this study, we developed patient derived xenograft (PDX) models from BRAF inhibitor resistant patients and, after characterization, tested rational second line combination therapies in co-clinical trials.Fresh tumor tissue from 12 patients after progression on vemurafenib or dabrafenib was implanted into immune deficient NSG mice. Once the tumor grafts were established, mice were continually dosed with PLX4720 to approximate clinical plasma levels to preserve the resistant phenotype. Xenografts were then characterized for genomic alterations and pathway activation status using a targeted sequencing array and a reverse phase protein array, respectively. We found at least 2 and up to 9 known deleterious alterations in all samples, many of which have been described as conferring resistance. The protein array clustered into two major groups', ' MAPK pathway activated and PI3K pathway activated, again consistent with previous reports. Integrating these data allowed us to design rational combination therapies for in vivo testing. We treated a PDX model with MET amplification and high phospho c-Met with the BRAF inhibitor LGX818 20mg/kg QD, the MEK inhibitor MEK162 3mg/kg QD, and the c-Met inhibitor INC280 25mg/kg QD (all p.o.). Although INC280 alone led to significant decrease in tumor growth, only the LGX818/ MEK162/ INC280 triple combination led to complete and sustained tumor regression in all mice. Further, we tested a second PDX model with a MET amplification (albeit broader and lower) but baseline pMET on the protein level. In this model, INC280 did not show any antitumor effect confirming the specificity for c-Met and the importance of validating genomic data.In summary, using our BRAF inhibitor resistant PDX model pipeline we were not only able to identify actionable alterations in all models, but also to test rational second line combination therapies in pre-clinical in vivo trials. Genomic data alone might not be sufficient to accurately predict therapy responses and protein arrays were a valuable tool to validate deleterious alteration calls.

Despite significant advances in targeted and immunotherapies, most patients cannot still be cured. Our aim is to identify new drug combinations that are synergistic in BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma, a sub-type representing 30% of cases for which targeted therapies are not currently available. We high-throughput screened a collection of 20 BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines with 180 drug combinations (60 library drugs used at 5 different concentrations combined with 3 clinically relevant anchor drugs) and generated over 8000 survival curves . We found that 25% of cell lines are highly sensitive to a combination of nilotinib plus trametinib and confirmed this finding with 2 independent assays. We further validated the drug synergy firstly using an independent collection of BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines (n=7), then a collection of BRAF/NRAS wild type patient derived xenotransplant cultures (n=3), and finally with a collection of BRAFV600E and NRASQ61 melanoma cell lines (n=12). Further, we generated a gene expression signature of cell lines that display synergy for the nilotinib/trametinib combination, and used it to classify human melanomas from Leeds Melanoma Project (N=171) and TCGA (n=470) cohorts. Tumors classified as “synergistic-like” (27.9 and 36.7%, respectively) are associated to decreased overall and recurrence free survival (P<0.05), suggesting that our combination might be effective in a relevant fraction of aggressive tumors. In order to identify drug resistance mechanisms we deployed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen. We found that loss of the tuberous sclerosis complex can confer resistance to nilotinib/trametinib, and validated this mechanism using clonal engineered lines. Since tuberous sclerosis complex genes are mutated in 10% of melanomas, this approach can help to identify patients potentially refractory to the treatment. We also investigated the molecular mechanism of nilotinib/trametinib synergy by analysing the level of several phosphoproteins upon treatment. We discovered that the nilotinib/trametinib combination synergistically reduce the level of P-ERK in synergistic cell lines but not in cell lines resistant to the drug combination, thus pointing out the MAPK pathway dependence of the synergy. This finding provides a putative marker to identify tumors responsive to the treatment. Finally, we tested in vivo the nilotinib/trametinib combination in a patient derived xenotransplant mouse model and showed that the combination is well tolerated and significantly more effective than the 2 drugs alone (P<0.01).

Protein levels in primary melanoma tumor samples demonstrated moderately elevated Usp9x/SOX2 protein expression in metastatic melanoma compared to primary melanoma patient tumors. Further, Usp9x knockdown or inhibition with G9, a DUB inhibitor, blocked BRAF/MEK kinase inhibitor-induced induction of SOX2 and fully suppressed in vitro colony growth of BRAF-mutant melanoma cells and promoted apoptosis.

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is notorious for the ability to change its phenotype in response to signals from the microenvironment, which might influence how melanoma responds to therapy. We have disclosed an association between fibroblast-induced phenotypic alterations in melanoma and resistance to the mutated BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (BRAFi). This signifies the need to find other targets than BRAF to eliminate stroma-influenced melanoma cells. To approach this challenge, we performed proteomic analysis and cancer drug sensitivity screening, comparing fibroblast-supported versus non-supported melanoma cells. We showed that the effect of fibroblasts was critically dependent on cell-cell proximity, where melanoma cells get trapped in a fibronectin network, produced by adjacent fibroblasts. In such environment, melanoma cells down-regulate melanocytic programs (MITF-driven), gain mesenchymal features (AXL, PDGFR, fibronectin) and activate stress/inflammatory-response signaling pathways (JNK and STAT3). Altogether, this indicates fibroblast-induced melanoma transition to a de-differentiated, mesenchymal-like, pro-inflammatory phenotype. Melanoma cells with such phenotype were less responsive to BRAF/MAPK inhibitors and a number of other targeted drugs. However, they showed enhanced sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and, particularly, an inhibitor of GSK3b, stimulating Wnt/b-catenin signaling. Further, we employed flow cytometry to measure the levels of Ki67 and pS6 in single melanoma cells upon different conditions/treatments. Such analysis allowed discrimination of cell subpopulations representing a proliferative and a quiescent cellular state, and nicely reflected the influence of the tested drugs in the presence or absence of fibroblasts. We observed a subpopulation of proliferative pS6high/Ki67high melanoma cells, which remained after treatment with BRAFi if fibroblasts were present. This, fibroblast-protected BRAFi-resistant cell subpopulation, could be reduced/eliminated by PI3K or GSK3b inhibitors, verifying PI3K/GSK3 as potential targets in fibroblast-rich tumors. Currently, we are using mass cytometry (CyTOF) to further characterize cell subpopulations with respect to multiple markers related to cell signaling and immune interactions. Preliminary results indicate that not only signaling protein levels, but also levels of immunoregulatory proteins are altered in melanoma cells that get support from the fibroblasts. In conclusion, we demonstrate fibroblast-induced melanoma switching to a mesenchymal-like pro-inflammatory phenotype, which favors melanoma resistance to BRAF inhibitors, but sensitizes to inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR-associated signaling. CyTOF-analysis of complex tumor-stroma cell systems is used to search for additional strategies to target stroma-supported melanoma cells, either at the level of signaling, or immune interactions.']",

        "Background":"[\"Control of mutant BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma by BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I) is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Up-regulation of growth factor receptor such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) or insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) is among the mechanisms underlying BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate for the first time that up-regulation of PDGFR, a growth factor receptor which markedly differs in its functional properties from its family member PDGFR, causes BRAF-I resistance in vitro and in vivo. PDGFR inhibition by PDGFR-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNAs) and by clinically available PDGFR inhibitors (sunitinib, imatinib and crenolanib) restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFR up-regulation is mediated by Sonic Hedgehog Homolog (Shh) pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly to PDGFR inhibition, Shh inhibition by the novel small molecule LDE225 restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. These effects are mediated by PDGFR down-regulation and by inhibition of ERK and AKT activation. The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by the association of PDGFR up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I +/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and less tumor regression. These findings suggest that monitoring patients for early PDGFR up-regulation will facilitate the identification of those who may benefit from the treatment with BRAF-I in combination with clinically approved PDGFR or Shh inhibitors\"]",

        "Background":"['Mutations in the B-raf oncogene constitutively activate the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. The most common BRAF mutation (V600E) occurs in approximately 70% of primary melanomas and 10% of colorectal cancers. Melanoma patients carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation respond with frequency of 80% to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, while colon cancer patients respond at a rate of 5% only, indicative of intrinsic resistance. Moreover, clinical benefit is further limited by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance among vemurafenib responders. Combination therapy targeting both BRAF(V600E) and possible escape pathways appears to be a promising approach to reverse resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular characterization and in vitro chemosensitivity profiles of 20 melanoma and 20 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Four of the colon and 11 of the melanoma cell lines were established at Oncotest from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Molecular profiles include the mutation status of BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS (exon sequencing) and protein levels for components of the MAPK, EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways (Western blot analysis). Sensitivity profiles for inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, EGFR and PI3K were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based survival and proliferation assay. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors was investigated by combination of vemurafenib with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or inhibitors of potential escape pathways like EGFR, PI3K/AKT or c-MET and evaluated by combination index according to Chou-Talalay.In line with the clinical situation, the BRAF V600E substitution was found in 13/20 (65%) of the melanoma and only in 4/20 (20%) of the colon cancer cell lines. BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in melanoma cell lines and KRAS mutations did not occur at all. Among the colon cancer cell lines, in addition to the BRAF(v600E) mutation, alteration in KRAS (10/20 cell lines), PIK3CA (6/20) and NRAS (1/20) were detected. Chemosensitivity profiling revealed intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors for 3/13 (23%) BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and for 3/4 (75%) BRAF(V600E) colon cancer cell lines. Reversal of the resistance of BRAF inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cell lines was recorded as synergism between vemurafenib and inhibitors of vasious kinases (c-MET, AKT, PI3K, MEK, or EGFR. A particularly strong synergistic interaction was found for vemurafenib and the c-MET inhibitor SU11274, irrespective of BRAF status. For colon cancer cell lines, the strongest synergisms were detected for the combinations of vemurafenib with inhibitors of c-MET, EGFR, PI3K, AKT and MEK.Displaying similar mutation and chemosensitivity profiles as melanomas and colon cancers in the clinic, the present cell line panels represent valuable tools to investigate the reversal of resistance towards BRAF inhibitors.']",

Methods', ' The oncocarta mutation panel was used to assess muations in 31 melanoma lines and short-term cultures. Each line was tested for viability in MTS assays and apoptosis by subG1 PI fractions over 72 hours. Western blots were used to measure Bcl-2 family protein expression. Results', ' There were 7 lines with no detectable mutations, 10 with mutations in NRAS or KRAS,13 with BRAF mutations and one with mutated cKit.Apoptosis induction was highest in the lines with mutated BRAF and correlated inversely with cell viability except for 2 lines with mutated CDK4 (R24c) which had low viability and low apoptosis.Inhibition of caspases indicated that apoptosis was the main mechanism for reduced cell viabilty. Induction of apoptosis correlated with upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3 protein Bim as reported in previous studies on the MEK inhibitor UO126. In particular there was selective upregulation of the short form of Bim and this correlated with induction of apoptosis. There were no significant changes in the the other BH3 only proteins PUMA or NOXA Combination of a MEK inhibitor with the BRAF inhibitor had strong potentiating effects on cell lines that were relatively resistant to the BRAF inhibitor. Conclusions', ' These studies confirm that the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 induces apoptosis in human melanoma with mutated BRAF at concentrations achievable in vivo.

Nine of 11 BRAFV600E, 4/5 BRAFV600K and 1/1 BRAFV600D mutant lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 (IC50<0.3M). These sensitive lines had wild-type MEK1/2 with or without PTEN mutations. Two of the three lines insensitive to GSK2118436 had either MEK1P124S or MEK2K66_K68del mutations. GSK2118436 treatment decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and cyclin D1 in both the sensitive and insensitive lines. However, GSK2118436 decreased S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation (pS6P) only in the sensitive lines. Cell lines sensitive to GSK2118436 were also sensitive to the allosteric MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 (IC50<0.01M). The combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 had a synergistic to additive effect on cell growth inhibition in the sensitive lines, but had minimal benefit in the three insensitive lines. Although 5/6 PTEN NULL lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 based on their IC50s, growth of these lines was inhibited less effectively by GSK2118436 compared to the PTEN WT lines evaluated by IC70. PTEN NULL cells displayed higher levels of basal AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) than PTEN WT lines. Treatment of PTEN NULL lines with GSK2118436 increased pAKT while similar treatment of PTEN WT lines decreased pAKT and increased PTEN expression. In combination with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458, GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 effectively inhibited MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR signaling, enhanced cell growth inhibition, and induced apoptosis evaluated by caspase 3/7 activation and/or PARP cleavage in both PTEN WT and PTEN NULL lines. In PTEN deficient lines, these combinations were more effective than the combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212. These results indicate MEK1/2 mutations associate with lack of sensitivity to single agent BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

Selective BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib have been observed to neutralize oncogenic the signaling, inhibit cellular growth, and improve patient outcome. Although these mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance have been reported, few studies focused on how to overcome the resistance. Propranolol, a non-selective β-blocker, was confirmed to involve in multiple anticancer effects. Our previous study also showed propranolol inhibited melanoma by suppressing MAPK and AKT pathways in vitro an in vivo. But its efficacy and mechanism of overcoming vemurafenib still remain unknown in melanoma. Here, we explored the effect of propranolol on the A375, P-8 (patient-derived melanoma cell line) vemurafenib resistance cell line and resistance mice xenografts. Cell viability assay demonstrated that 2μM -20μM vemurafenib couldn’t decrease the proliferation but 24h-120h of incubation of 2μM-200μM propranolol inhibited viability with a concentration and time dependent manner in the two resistance cell line. TUNEL staining showed 24h incubation of 20μM propranolol alone or plus 4μM vemurafeinb obviously increased cell apoptosis. Mice received daily ig. administration of propranolol at the dose of 2 mg/kg alone or plus 10 mg/kg for 21days. The mean tumor volume at day 21 in resistance A375 xenografts was 221.13 ± 7.65mm3vs. 904.12 ± 70.57mm3 vs. 2021 ± 316.24mm3for the propranolol plus vemurafenib, propranolol alone, vemurafenib alone, respectively. Propranolol improved mice survival, 28.6% animal dead in plus group, 57.1% mice dead in the propranolol group, and 71.5% animal dead in vemurafenib at end of treatment. IHC showed propranolol also reduced Ki67 index both in propranolol and plus group when compared with vemurafenib treated mice. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was performed to explore the mechanism of propranolol overcoming the resistance, the data showed propranolol largely reduced mRNA levels of IGF family (IGFBP3, IGFLR1, IGFBP6, IGF2, IGF1R.etc.) but elevated the expressions of innate immune related genes (NKG7, TLR9, NCR3.etc.) in A375-vemr cell line. These results provide a strategy of therapeutic resistance for the clinic, importantly, this study also provide a clue targeting IGF family and regulating innate immune might be a potential strategy to suppress resistance in BRAF inhibitor therapies in melanoma.']",

Uveal melanoma is characterized by oncogenic mutations in Gnaq and Gna11, which activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK). Furthermore, both primary and metastatic UM are characterized by genetic abnormalities, including the amplification of the chromosomal arm 8q and monosomy of chromosome 3, which are significantly associated with poor prognosis. The oncogene MYC, which is located on 8q24.1, is amplified in nearly 70% of uveal melanoma, and is also regulated by the MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulators have become attractive targets for cancer therapy. In particular, the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 has shown selective inhibition of c-Myc expression, followed by the suppression of c-Myc-dependent target genes. We examined the effects of JQ1 in a panel of 8 UM cell lines, including cell lines with Gnaq/Gna11 mutations (92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202, Omm1), a cell line with MYC amplification (Mel290), and cells without either mutation or amplification (C918, Mel285). The Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells were the most sensitive to growth inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of JQ1 (IC50=200nM), followed by the cell line with amplified MYC (IC50=1M), while the cells without mutation or amplification exhibited little inhibition. We also examined the biochemical effects of JQ1 treatment, which caused a dose- and time-dependent suppression of c-Myc as well as survivin, XIAP, ERK1 and E2F1, while p21and the pro-apoptotic protein Bim were induced in all the cell lines. Interestingly, JQ1 also suppressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and induced PARP cleavage only in the Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated a cell cycle arrest in G1 in all the cell lines and an apoptotic population in sub-G1in the mutant cells. Furthermore, treatment with JQ1 resulted in significant antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of uveal melanoma with Gnaq mutation.

Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and more effective targeted therapies for this devastating disease. The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type. This landmark study highlighted the important role of the previously understudied NF1 tumor suppressor in melanoma pathogenesis, especially for the 9% of melanoma patients who have acquired inactivating NF1-mutations, but lack hotspot mutations that activate BRAF or RAS. To date, animal models have not been developed for the NF1-mutant subtype of melanoma, which has significantly impaired the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this subtype. Here we report the first zebrafish model for NF1-mutant melanoma, which we generated by combining the loss of nf1 with loss of both pten and p53. The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas.

Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Early clinical studies have shown that concurrent administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, dabrafenib and trametinib, is more active in patients with BRAFV600E/K melanoma than either single agent alone. Even though the combination of BRAF/MEK inhibitors is initially highly effective in treating melanoma in a subset of patients, progression to resistance ultimately occurscommonly via reactivation of the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to counter primary resistance and prevent the emergence of secondary resistance are needed. Following pharmacological or progressive genetic perturbations, dynamic and system-wide adaptive changes (reprogramming) in the expression and activity of multiple kinases (collectively termed the kinome) clearly occur in tumor cells. Rich networks of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, many of which are understudied, are integrated into the signaling systems controlled by oncogenes known to drive melanoma. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the kinome at baseline, during the adaptive response to kinase inhibitor treatment, and in the context of acquired resistance is critical. We use Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs), mixtures of covalently immobilized, linker-adapted kinase inhibitors coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), to assess changes in activation of kinases in untreated samples, during acute inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK and in the context of acquired resistance. Our enhanced MIB/MS technology allows us to study over 75-80% of the expressed kinome (and numerous lipid and metabolic kinases) simultaneously using lysates from cell lines, genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) tumors, patient-derived xenografts or human melanoma. We have identified several kinases (e.g. PDGFR, DDR1, MAP3K1) that are activated upon acute treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, or dabrafenib/trametinib as well as in drug-resistant human melanoma cells and BRAFV600E/PTEN-/- GEMM-derived tumors and cell lines. Thus, studies using MIB/MS to measure dynamic kinome responses have identified kinases that have not been previously shown to be involved in the adaptive response to BRAF and/or MEK inhibition. We are currently targeting kinases involved in adaptive kiome reprogramming, pharmacologically or by RNAi, to determine whether their activation leads to vulnerability. This work will lead to the identification of novel and rationally predicted therapies for patients with advanced melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['INTRODUCTION', ' BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations occur in over half of all human melanomas. BRAF-mutant tumors are highly sensitive to small molecule inhibitors directed against the oncogenic BRAF protein. However, in tumors that lack the specific mutation, patients have few effective therapeutic options. To address the need for new therapies for patients with BRAF-wild-type (wt) melanoma, we hypothesized that the inhibition of the major nuclear export receptor CRM1 would result in nuclear accumulation of nuclear proteins, increase apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest independent of BRAF mutational status. To test our hypothesis, we examined the effects of a novel CRM1 inhibitor on melanoma cell lines with various BRAF and NRAS mutational backgrounds. METHODS', ' We used human malignant melanoma cell lines with BRAF mutation (Sk-Mel-28, A375, Mel-624, UACC903, MalMe-3M), BRAF-wt (MeWo) and BRAF-wt and NRAS mutation (Hs940T) to assess the effects of CRM1 inhibition, BRAF inhibition (PLX4032) or MEK inhibition (U0126) using both mono- or combination therapy. MTT assays were used to evaluate the effects of treatment on cell proliferation. FACS analysis with annexin/PI staining was performed to assess effects on cell cycle and cell death. The Chou-Talalay method was used to assess synergistic drug combination effects. Treatment effects on cleaved caspase-3, PARP cleavage, P53, and FOXO3 were analyzed by western blot analysis. RESULTS', ' As mono therapy, CRM1 inhibition led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and an increase in apoptosis in both BRAF wt and mutant cell lines. The degree of inhibition and cell death achieved by CRM1 inhibition across all melanoma cell lines is comparable to the results achieved by BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 in BRAF mutant cell lines. Furthermore, the combination of CRM1 inhibition and BRAF inhibition results in a strongly synergistic combination against BRAF mutant cell lines with a statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSION', ' We found that relative to other cancer cell types, both BRAF-mutant and BRAF-wt melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to CRM1 inhibition. In addition, CRM1 inhibition significantly enhanced the effect of PLX4032 in BRAF-mutant cell lines, suggesting that the combination of these two drugs may address the emergence of acquired resistance to BRAF monotherapy. Based on these results, CRM1 inhibition warrants further investigation to determine its potential benefit in treating melanoma patients independent of BRAF mutation status.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has been proven to be efficacious for the treatment of melanomas harboring (V600E) mutation. While the response rate is high, resistance is inevitable. The response to salvage therapy is poor. While the MEK inhibitor may be able to enhance anti-tumor efficacy of vemurafenib, but patients eventually relapse. Hence, there is an urgent need for second line treatment for melanoma patients who fail vemurafenib treatment.In this study, we discovered that BRAF inhibitor-resistant (BR) melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to arginine deprivation. Arginine deprivation was achieved using arginine degrading enzyme (pegylated arginine deiminase, ADI-PEG20, kindly provided by Polaris). ADI-PEG20 has been shown to induce autophagy in primary melanoma culture derived from patients whose tumors do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). Apoptosis does occur when these cells are exposed longer (5-7 days) and at higher doses. Inducible ASS expression upon arginine deprivation also impedes the antitumor effect of ADI-PEG20. We have found that BR cells from MEL-1220 (derived from patient with V600E and ASS (-)), A375, and A2058 cells (inducible ASS) cultured in the presence of vemurafenib at IC50 over 20 weeks had non-inducible ASS expression. MTT and Annexin V/PI analyses showed that ADI-PEG20 induced 3-6 fold increase in apoptosis and growth inhibition in BR cells compared to parental cells following 3-day incubation. These results were further confirmed by increased active (cleaved) form of caspase-3 as detected by western blotting after the addition of ADI-PEG20. The mouse xenograft model also verified that ADI-PEG20 abolished tumor growth of A2058BR cells while only retardation of growth seen in A2058 cells (the reduction rate of tumor volume is 92% vs. 63%). We found that two vital autophagic proteins (Beclin1 and ATG5) decreased in resistant cells after treatment with ADI-PEG20, which might explain the inability to undergo autophagy upon arginine deprivation as a survival mechanism and re-directing the cells toward apoptosis. The other mechanism leading to non-inducible ASS expression is c-Myc degradation. It has been proven that c-myc is a positive regulator in ASS transcription, and c-Myc stability is governed by ubiquitination. By immunoprecipitation assay, we found that BR cells had lower levels of deubiquitinating enzyme USP28, and hence cannot prevent c-Myc from ubiquitin-dependent prosteasomal degradation. Therefore, our results demonstrated that BRAF inhibitor resistance suppresses c-Myc-mediated ASS transcription and in turn increases sensitivity to ADI-PEG20.In conclusion, ADI-PEG20 appears to be a good candidate for targeted therapy for melanoma patients who have tumor recurrence or disease progression after vemurafenib treatment.

Preclinical data suggest that resistance is frequently driven by redundant growth factor signaling. For example, HGF has been reported to mediate resistance to BRAF inhibitors in V600E BRAF mutant melanoma. Furthermore, clinical data support these findings as circulating and tumor HGF levels have been shown to correlate with outcome in BRAF mutant melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib. In this study, we evaluated the ability of HGF / MET signaling to attenuate the effects of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in the context of V600E BRAF and NRAS mutant cell lines. Our data suggest that combined blockade of MET and MAPK pathway signaling may be required for a robust and durable clinical response in melanoma.Methods', ' To confirm the ability of HGF to rescue V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines from the effects of vemurafenib, G361 and SKMEL5 cells were treated with vemurafenib alone or in combination with HGF.

Combinations of a potent and selective MET inhibitor (Compound A) with vemurafenib or PD0325901 were tested to evaluate their ability to attenuate the HGF-mediated resistance. To identify other cell lines rescued by HGF, thirteen V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines were treated with a dose response matrix of vemurafenib and HGF. The ability of six additional growth factors to rescue cells from the effects of vemurafenib was also tested. Three NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines were also screened for HGF-mediated resistance to PD0325901.Results', ' Nine of thirteen V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines were rescued from the effects of vemurafenib by co-treatment with HGF. Detailed analysis of G361 and SKMEL5 cells revealed that HGF was also capable of rescuing the cells from the effects of PD0325901. This HGF-mediated rescue was attenuated by treatment with combinations of vemurafenib + compound A or PD0325901 + compound A. Mechanistic cell cycle analysis of the HGF-mediated rescue of vemurafenib in G361 cells revealed an increase in proliferating cells and a reduction in growth arrested cells, whereas rescue of PD0325901 treatment occurred through a reduction in the percentage of dead or dying cells. Of the seven growth factors tested, HGF was the predominate growth factor capable of conferring resistance to vemurafenib. Furthermore, HGF rescued one of three NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines from the effects of PD0325901, highlighting the breadth of HGF-mediated resistance in melanoma cell lines.Conclusion', ' These findings demonstrate the potential role for HGF / MET signaling in mediating resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in melanoma, and support the clinical evaluation of MET kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies to HGF in this setting.']",

Intrinsic and acquired resistance to BRAF V600E targeted therapies (BRAFi) in metastatic melanoma patients further underscores the need for global profiling of melanoma circuitry at the functional level. Therefore, activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and phosphoproteomics was carried out to decipher steady state differences in global signaling mechanisms in nave and BRAFi resistant melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutations.Four cell lines (A375, 1205Lu, WM164 and WM793) were selected to evaluate different molecular backgrounds of BRAF mutation based on their PTEN status (either WT or null). For each cell type, both the nave and BRAFi resistant lines were analyzed via ABPP as well as chemical labeling with tandem mass tags (TMT) prior to discovery phosphoproteomics. While the ABPP approach mined for kinases, phosphoproteomics identified STY phosphorylated peptides providing information on signaling via kinase substrates. LC-MS/MS discovery proteomics (RSLC and Q Exactive, Thermo) identified and relatively quantified all peptides observed in ABPP and TMT phosphoproteomics experiments. MaxQuant was used for data evaluation; preliminary statistical analyses were performed in Perseus to select significant differences for pathway mapping (GeneGO, Metacore) and follow up experiments using siRNA or pharmacological inhibition. Adaptive responses to combination treatment were also explored using the SysQuant workflow for quantitative expression analysis and phosphoproteomics. These experiments served as a basis for comparison for a pilot project of 12 metastatic tumors from BRAF mutant melanoma patients selected for comparison of good and poor survival outcomes.ABPP measurements on different cell line models (A375, 1205Lu, WM793 and WM164) reveal significant differences in ATP uptake of proteins in the resistant cell line model compared to its nave counterpart. For example, in the 1205Lu cell line several proteins including EGFR, p38alpha, DNA-PK formed an interconnected pathway. Overall we identified between 2,000-2,800 proteins in each cell line with 150 kinases. Isobaric labeling coupled to phosphoproteomics identified 1,600 quantifiable proteins with 4,000 phosphorylation sites. Phosphoproteomics revealed concomitant increase in phosphorylation levels of the substrates acted upon by kinases showing higher ATP uptake in ABPP measurements. For example, in 1205Lu BRAFi resistant cells, CDK1, CDK2 and DNA-PK showed higher ATP uptake and their substrates SSK1, DPYSL3, and vimentin showed higher phosphorylation levels.The complementary nature of the two functional proteomics approaches provided holistic overview of signalling network in melanoma and enabled selection of targets for follow-up studies.']",

Phase I/II data published recently for a combination of DAB and TRA suggest improved efficacy compared with single-agent therapy; nevertheless, the short duration of responses even for the combination points to an urgent need for further improvement.BI 882370, a potent and selective B/CRAF inhibitor, binds to the DFG-out (inactive) conformation of BRAF, whereas VEM as well as DAB occupy the DFG-in (active) conformation. BI 882370 inhibited proliferation of BRAFmut melanoma cell lines with about 100x higher potency (EC50 1 - 10 nM) than VEM; BRAFwt cell lines were not affected at 1 M.For studies in nude mouse xenograft models, VEM and DAB were dosed to provide exposures achieved in patients; TRA was used at the MTD for mice, resulting in exposures at or above the exposures tolerated by humans. In the G361 melanoma model (BRAFV600E), 1st line treatment with 25 mg/kg BI 882370 administered twice daily (bid) resulted in partial regression of all tumors, superior to results achieved by VEM, DAB as well as their combination.To model clinical resistance, a large cohort of A375 melanoma (BRAFV600E) bearing mice was treated with VEM; without exception, all tumors responded with partial regression and their median volume reached a nadir on day 11. Thereafter, the majority of tumors resumed growth in spite of continued treatment, whereas tumors in a subset of animals regressed further. Progressing tumors were randomized to 2nd line therapy on day 36 (median volume 280 mm3). TRA did not show any efficacy in this resistant population. BI 882370 induced tumor regression, however, resistance developed within 3 weeks. BI 882370 in combination with TRA resulted in more pronounced regressions and resistance was not observed until the end of the experiment, 6 weeks after initiation of 2nd line therapy.Importantly, in multiple in vivo studies performed to date, mice treated with BI 882370 at doses of 25 mg/kg bid for several weeks did not show any body weight loss or clinical signs of intolerability. Mice treated for 2 weeks were euthanized and major organs subjected to histological analysis. No changes were observed in any of the animals; in particular, there was no evidence for epidermal hyperplasia. Further, a pilot study in male rats dosed at 25 mg/kg bid for 2 weeks did not result in any toxicologically relevant findings in terms of clinical chemistry, hematology, pathology and toxicogenomics of liver and skin.Our results suggest that compared to 1st generation BRAF inhibitors, BI 882370 may provide an improved therapeutic window, enabling more pronounced and longer-lasting pathway suppression and thus resulting in improved efficacy.']",

        "Background":"['Development of a successful immunotherapeutic vaccine targeting melanoma requires the use of multiple melanoma associated antigens (MAA). Expression of several MAAs is regulated by the micropthalmia transcription factor (MITF), which in turn is regulated by members of the MAPK pathway, such as ERK. It is also known that 70% of melanomas express the genetic lesion BRAFV600E. Based on this knowledge, we hypothesize that the use of a specific BRAFV600E inhibitor would enhance MITF mediated MAA expression and thus serve as a viable target for immunotherapy. We have developed a vaccinia virus based melanoma vaccine using patient derived primary melanoma cells that are rich in MAAs such as gp100, tyrosinase, and TRP-1. Our results indicated that our cells were either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutated BRAF gene. In addition, our cells were responsive to treatment by PLX-4032, an FDA approved treatment for melanoma, as evidenced by inhibition of phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, two key players in the MAPK pathway. Phenotypically, the migratory and invasive properties of our cell lines were also altered by PLX-4032. Most interestingly was the observation that upon treatment with PLX-4032, the expression of various MAAs was altered. Specifically, the expression of gp100, MART-1, and tyrosinase increased both on the RNA level as well as on the protein level. Our results warrant further investigation into a combinatorial therapeutic approach to treat melanoma by which increasing the expression of various immunologically relevant MAAs, upon treatment with PLX-4032, followed by vaccination may lead to a more robust and targeted anti-melanoma immune response.']",

        "Background":"['Activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutations occur in 50% of melanoma, 45% of papillary thyroid cancer and 10% of colon cancer. BRAF inhibitors have elicited significant clinical response in melanomas but acquired resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Therefore, consideration of new treatment strategies to block activity of mutant BRAF and deter therapeutic resistance is warranted. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone required for the stability of hundreds of client proteins, including the RAF family of kinases, and has emerged as a highly relevant anticancer target. Ganetespib is a second generation, small molecule HSP90 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials. To investigate the potential for ganetespib in the treatment of melanoma we evaluated its preclinical activity as monotherapy, and in combination with targeted agents, in cells sensitive or resistant to BRAF inhibitors. Ganetespib displayed potent anticancer activity in a large panel of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma, thyroid and colon cancer cell lines, with IC50 between 4 and 40 nM. Further analysis showed that ganetespib disrupted oncogenic signaling by inducing the destabilization of mutant BRAF and subsequent inactivation of MEK and ERK. Levels of wild-type BRAF were only slightly reduced in response to ganetespib treatment, implying that the stability of activated BRAF is more reliant on HSP90 and that ganetespib may selectively deplete oncogenic forms of BRAF. Notably, ganetespib treatment also led to depletion of CRAF, which is implicated in driving therapeutic resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In an effort to maximize antitumor activity, we combined low levels of ganetespib with BRAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and observed increased cytotoxicity compared to single agent treatment. Both the BRAF and MEK inhibitors were cytostatic on their own, which may be due to continued PI3K/mTOR signaling. We subsequently assayed the combination of ganetespib with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and observed synergistic increases in cell death. Importantly, ganetespib was capable of blocking the feedback activation on MAPKK induced by a MEK inhibitor as well as the activation of ERK by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. To determine if these results translated in vivo, similar combinations were performed in BRAF mutant human melanoma xenografts. Co-administration of ganetespib with either a BRAF or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppressed in vivo tumor growth to a greater extent compared to monotherapy. Finally, we show that ganetespib effectively blocked MAPK signaling and killed RPMI-7951 melanoma cells (IC50 = 4 nM), which are resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors due to the overexpression of COT. In conclusion, targeting HSP90 with ganetespib represents a promising approach for the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-driven cancers and may be especially relevant in the context of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.']",

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is particularly important for the survival and proliferation of melanoma cells and somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS are frequently observed in melanoma. Recently, it has been reported that the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib showed high response rates and improved overall survival in melanomas with BRAF-activating mutations. However, as BRAF inhibitors induce RAF paradoxical activation via RAF dimerization in BRAF wild-type cells, rapid emergence of acquired resistance and secondary skin tumors as well as presence of few effective treatment options for melanoma bearing wild-type BRAF (including NRAS mutant melanoma) are clinical concerns. In this preclinical study, we describe the biological characterization of TAK-632 as a potent and selective pan-RAF inhibitor that suppresses RAF activity in BRAF wild-type cells with minimal RAF paradoxical activation. We used both genetic and chemical approaches to investigate the dependence of NRAS-mutated melanoma and BRAF inhibitor-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cells on RAF. Our analysis reveals that the MAPK pathway and proliferation of these cells is highly dependent on RAF. Such dependence was not observed in several RAS/RAF-wild type and KRAS-mutated cells. We also show that TAK-632 induces RAF dimerization but inhibits the kinase activity of the RAF dimer, probably because of its slow dissociation from RAF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of TAK-632 and various MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors exhibits synergistic anti-proliferative effects on these cells. Our findings indicate that TAK-632 has favorable characteristics in terms of suppressing the proliferation of NRAS mutant melanoma and BRAF inhibitor-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cells.']",

While the worldwide incidence rate of melanoma has increased during the last decade, current therapies for melanoma do not provide long-term effect. The highly heterogeneous expression signature of melanoma underlies the inefficient therapy and accentuates the inevitability of profound molecular understanding of melanoma, its maintenance and progression. In this study, we aimed to reveal the complex patterns of distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the progression and maintenance of melanoma using high-throughput sequencing technologies. Series of melanoma tumor tissues representing discrete stages of the malignant progression were deeply sequenced. Integrative analysis revealed hard-wired genomic aberrations and associated transcriptomic consequences. These genomic aberrations included clusters of oncogenes brought together by structural variations, which cooperated in their amplifications and subsequent up-regulated expressions. We believe that these hard-wired genetic changes are biologically significant; they sustain the survival of the tumor and offer the advantage of the distant metastasis. We reconstituted the architecture of melanoma progression and maintenance and we identified gene cassettes with a putative role in sustaining tumor growth. The correlation of these gene cassettes with the cancer phenotype and the feasibility of these putative oncogenes as candidates for targeted therapy were addressed using cell-based assays on a high content screening platform. Analysis of the matched cell lines derived from the same patient offered a valuable resource for in vitro manipulation, testing of drugs and functional validation.

Membranes were incubated with antibodies against Hsp 70 (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), Hsp 90 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), pS6 and pBAD (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA).Using MTS assay, we found that DT3 (IC50 38.8 M) and simvastatin (IC50 22.7M) have cytotoxic effects on melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28, but on the SK-MEL-2 cells DT3 does not have an effect at the concentrations studied (10-40 M DT3) yet simvastatin (IC50 16.9 M) does have cytotoxicity. Further studies determined that combinations of these drugs display a synergistic effect on SK-MEL-28 by inhibition of pS6 and pBAD and subsequent apoptosis. However, these effects are not observed in SK-MEL-2 cells; treated SK-MEL-2 cells show over-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggestive of a rescue effect leading to lesser cytotoxic activity. The selective cytotoxicity observed in BRAF-mutated cells and not in wild type BRAF melanoma cell lines by both DT3 and simvastatin warrants further research into the potential therapeutic use of these combinations. This observation has added importance in the light of recent findings that show the acquisition of BRAF mutation is an early event in melanogenesis and hence these compounds may have a key role in chemoprevention approaches to melanoma.']",

In contrast, Wnt/-catenin signaling appears to play a paradoxical role in melanoma where its activation is anti-oncogenic and a marker of good prognosis. Previous studies have shown that activation of the NRAS/BRAF/MEK pathway suppresses Wnt/-catenin signaling and reduces apoptotic sensitivity to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in melanoma. MEK pathway activation stabilized AXIN1, a Wnt/-catenin inhibitor, in some melanoma cell lines through a proteasome-dependent process and co-treatment with Wnt3A and BRAF/MEK kinase inhibitors resulted in a reduction of AXIN1 and full activation of apoptosis. Further, AXIN1 knockdown sensitized BRAF/MEK inhibitor insensitive cells to kinase inhibition, providing a prominent role for AXIN1 in determining melanoma cell apoptotic responsiveness and exposing a potential mechanism for improving kinase inhibitor clinical activity. While AXIN1 protein levels appear to be regulated by ubiquitination, the enzymes involved in control of its ubiquitination or deubiquitination are not fully defined. Here we show that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X), a deubiquitinating enzyme whose expression is elevated in melanoma, binds and deubiquitinates AXIN1. USP9X knockdown resulted in increased ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated depletion of AXIN1 (but not AXIN2), resulting in a reduction in AXIN1 cellular half-life. USP9X knockdown elevated -catenin response genes (>2-fold) in melanoma cells treated with Wnt3A. USP9X depletion also increased apoptotic responsiveness to Wnt3A or BRAF/MEK inhibitor and overcame BRAF inhibitor resistance in A375R cells.

        "Background":"['Inherent and acquired resistance of melanomas carrying active mutations in BRAF to mutant BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) remains a major obstacle for curative treatment of the disease. Since both BRAFi and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) kill sensitive melanoma cells by activating the BH3-only protein Bim, we examined whether they cooperate in killing of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells. We show here that co-treatment with the HDACi SAHA and the BRAFi PLX4720 synergistically kills BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells in vitro, and that the combination of SAHA and the clinically available BRAFi vemurafenib cooperatively inhibits melanoma growth in vivo. Although SAHA plus PLX4720 activated the caspase cascade, the latter did not appear to be indispensable for induction of cell death. Likewise, PLX4720 alone kills sensitive melanoma cells in a caspase-independent manner. Similar to caspases, Bim seemed dispensable for synergistic killing by SAHA and PLX4720. The mechanism by which co-treatment with HDACi and BRAFi kills BRAFV600E melanoma cells remains to be elucidated, but we have found that this is not mediated by receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), which is essential for induction of programmed necrosis. Regardless, our results suggest that combinations of HDACi and BRAFi may have therapeutic advantages, in that the conventional caspase-dependent, mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic machinery is often suppressed in melanoma cells.']",

        "Background":"['Despite recent success of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic, nearly all of those treated follow a course in which initial tumor regression was followed by eventual relapse, which constitutes a major barrier to long-term therapeutic management of melanoma. We have identified a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance that arises from the release of TGF from melanomas that lack PTEN expression leading to the recruitment of host fibroblasts and the generation of a protective microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine fibronectin secretion facilitating therapeutic escape. Preliminary studies show that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines that lacked PTEN expression dramatically increased their secretion of TGF- following vemurafenib treatment, as detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autocrine TGF secretion initiated with vemurafinib treatment stimulated the upregulation and secretion of fibronectin in PTEN- cells. The vemurafenib-mediated ECM remodeling in this case was dependent upon autocrine TGF signaling and could be attenuated following pre-treatment with the TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB505124 or by siRNA knockdown of TGF receptor I. A mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomic screen in conjunction with innovative network modeling approaches suggested that increased integrin 51 signaling was a key adaptive response of PTEN- melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitor therapy. The importance of increased fibronectin expression and integrin 51 signaling in the therapeutic escape of PTEN- melanoma cells was confirmed by the significant increases in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis observed following siRNA knockdown of either integrin 5, 1, or fibronectin expression. A mass spectrometry screen (LC-MRM) of 18 BH3 proteins demonstrated Mcl-1 and Bak to be critical apoptosis regulators in the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance response. The importance of PTEN loss and Mcl-1 downregulation in therapeutic escape was validated in PTEN- melanoma cell lines expressing doxycycline inducible forms of PTEN, lipid phosphatase mutant PTEN and Mcl-1. Novel organotypic co-culture models were developed to demonstrate that TGF- released from PTEN- melanoma cell lines activated host fibroblasts leading to the attenuation of drug response in the tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that BRAF inhibition remodels both the melanoma and host microenvironments to provide a protective sanctuary for the minor populations of melanoma cells that escape therapy. We postulate that tumor eradication can only be achieved by a dual therapeutic strategy that targets both the bulk tumor and the microenvironment.']",

        "Background":"['Phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells can reason diversity in therapy responses within the same tumor, which might influence the overall efficacy of the treatment. Tumor stroma is an important contributor to intratumoral heterogeneity and can play a significant modulatory role in therapy response/resistance. Through studies on biological mechanisms of stroma-promoted resistance, novel targets could be identified for combination therapies aimed to eradicate both stroma-dependent and independent counterparts of the tumor.In this study we explore how the efficacy of the BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) vemurafenib, a targeted agent commonly used against BRAF-mutant malignant melanoma, is modulated by stromal cells. By using multiple co-culture systems and experimental metastasis models, we showed that in the presence of lung fibroblasts, adjacent melanoma cells respond poorly to BRAFi. The protective influence of stroma was associated with stroma-induced changes in the melanoma cell phenotype, which was mapped by global gene expression and proteome analysis. We revealed that under the influence of fibroblasts, melanoma cells underwent a phenotype transition to the invasive, mesenchymal-like state characterized by down-regulation of melanocytic markers (MITF and its targets), up-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)/RTK-linked signaling (like AXL or PDGFR activating down-stream PI3K) and elevation of extracellular-matrix fibronectin. We propose that these alterations allow melanoma cells to utilize alternative signaling pathways, like RTK-PI3K-mTOR instead of BRAF-driven MAPK, which reduces sensitivity to BRAFi. This scenario is further supported by the observations that', ' i) upon BRAFi treatment, stroma-protected melanoma maintained high levels of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), a mTOR effector protein; ii) inhibition of mTOR or the upstream pathway PI3K together with BRAF eradicated pS6high subpopulations and enhanced the anti-proliferative effect in stroma-interacting melanoma; iii) the benefit of mTOR and BRAF co-inhibition was also seen in early-stage lung metastases in vivo.In conclusion, our findings signify the importance of stromal cells, specifically lung fibroblasts, in regulating melanoma cell phenotype and signaling, which impairs response to BRAFi. The stroma-induced invasive phenotype determinants that facilitate RTK-PI3K-mTOR signaling (e.g. AXL, PDGFR or fibronectin-binding integrins) could represent potential targets for overcoming stroma-mediated resistance to BRAFi. Currently, we are testing BRAFi in combination with several novel inhibitors of the identified RTKs and performing a cancer drug sensitivity screen to reveal the most effective drug combinations against stroma-interacting melanoma cells.']",

BRD4, the best studied family member, binds to the regulatory regions of oncogenes such as MYC, thereby controlling its expression and that of the downstream transcriptome. Following the identification of the first selective inhibitors, BET proteins have been shown to play essential roles in hematological and, more recently, in solid tumors. Here we studied the efficacy of the novel BET inhibitor BAY 1238097 in melanoma models.BAY 1238097 was a potent BET inhibitor with IC50 values of 47 and 295 nM for BRD4 BD1 and BD2, respectively. In NanoBRET assays, the interaction between BRD4, BRD3 or BRD2 with histone H4 was blocked in intact cells with IC50 values of 65 nM, 294 nM and 642 nM, respectively. In addition to its strong anti-proliferative activity in several hematological tumor models, BAY 1238097 was also effective in several melanoma cell lines with GI50 values below 500 nM in BRAF wild-type (CHL-1, COLO-792, B16F10, IPC-298, MeWo) as well as BRAF mutant (A375, G-361, SK-MEL-30, LOX-IMVI, SK-MEL-5, MEL-HO) models. Resistant cell lines with GI50 values above 10 M were identified in both the BRAF wild-type and mutant groups. ChIP analysis performed in BRAF wild-type CHL-1 cells showed that BAY 1238097 displaced BRD4 from regulatory regions of oncogenes such as MYC, leading to loss of expression. The oxygen consumption rates of the melanoma cell lines were measured and we found that cell lines sensitive to BAY 1238097 depended on oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis for energy production.In vivo efficacy was determined for BAY 1238097 in three patient-derived melanoma models harboring the wild-type BRAF gene. Daily, oral treatment with 7.5 mg/kg BAY 1238097 led to significantly reduced tumor growth (39% T/C) in one model. Interestingly, this model was resistant to dacarbazine given i.p. at 100 mg/kg daily. No biologically significant anti-tumor activity was observed for the two other models treated with the same conditions (62% and 70% T/C, respectively).Altogether the results show BAY 1238097 to be a potent inhibitor of BRD4 binding to histones. The compound has strong anti-proliferative activity in different melanoma models, regardless of the BRAF mutation status but related to the metabolic activity. One out of three patient-derived melanoma models with wild-type BRAF responded to BAY 1238097 treatment in vivo.

Provided that MAPK signaling targets the micropthalmia transcription factor (MITF), which is linked to the expression of various melanoma associated antigens (MAAs), we hypothesized that the inhibition of BRAFV600E can modulate the expression of MAAs. Since MAAs are essential in the development of a melanoma vaccine, due to their increased immunogenicity, altering their expression can be a useful immunotherapeutic approach to targeting melanoma. Using patient derived melanoma cell lines, which express various MAAs; our laboratory has developed a vaccinia virus based immunotherapeutic vaccine. These melanoma cell lines have been characterized by their status of BRAFV600E mutation and found to be either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutation.

Moreover, we observed that the expression of various MAAs was enhanced upon treatment with PLX4032.

Although tumors in patients frequently shrink significantly within weeks of initiation of treatment, resistance eventually develops in many patients, with a median progression free survival of approximately 7 months. Evaluation of the biomarker and phenotypic correlates of response are difficult to determine as paired pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies generally only represent one on-treatment time point when available. A better in vivo understanding of the effects of BRAF inhibitor-treatment of relevant mouse models may yield insights into the nature of the clinical response and subsequent relapse. The conditional BRAF/PTEN mouse model of melanoma that we co-developed is ideal to study this process. In this non-xenograft model, expression of BRAF V600E and loss of PTEN is under control of the Cre-Lox recombination system. Expression of the Cre recombinase is under control of the tyrosinase promoter, ensuring that recombination is limited to melanocytes. The Cre recombinase is fused to an estrogen receptor that inhibits the activity of the recombinase. Activation of the Cre recombinase requires topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for induction of recombination at specific time points in the life span of the mouse.

Effective targeted therapies are not currently available for this sub-type of the disease, which represents up to 30% of melanomas. By viability assays we characterized the sensitivity to 240 combinations of clinically relevant drugs in a collection of 21 BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines. We analysed 8360 survival curves and found that 16 (73%) and 5 (23%) cell lines are highly sensitive to temozolomide plus olaparib and to nilotinib plus trametinib combinations, respectively. Two independent experimental approaches validated these drug synergies.By -omics technologies we deeply characterized the cell line profiles of mutations, copy number changes, DNA methylation, and gene and microRNA expression. We generated gene expression signatures of synergistic and resistant cell lines for the 2 drug combinations and used them to classify 374 human melanomas. Tumors significantly associated to nilotinib plus trametinib synergism signature were significantly enriched for high immune response and proliferative Jonsson's expression classes, while tumors associated to the signature of drug resistance are enriched for pigmentation class. Melanomas associated to temozolomide plus olaparib resistance signature displayed enrichment for normal class. We are currently confirming the representation of these signatures in an independent cohort of melanomas and looking for other clinical correlates. We are also validating the predictivity of these gene expression signatures in independent cohorts of melanoma cell lines. Prospectively, this may represent an approach to identify patients that could have the maximal benefit from these drug combinations.Additionally, we have recently performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify drug resistance genes for these 2 drug combinations.

        "Background":"['Background', '  An estimated 70,000 diagnoses of brain metastases (BM) occur each year in the U.S., with an incidence of 5-7% in breast and melanoma and 20% in lung cancer.  Despite its prominence, the biology of BM remains poorly understood.  Several theories of BM development exist, including the linear progression model, which suggests that the metastatic capabilities of tumor cells develop at primary sites following the accumulation of alterations. The parallel progression model argues that tumor cells disseminate early and accumulate changes independently at the secondary site.  We compare the tumor profiles of BM from common cancers to understand the biology and to identify differential treatment strategies.  Methods', ' Tumor samples were profiled using a multiplatform service (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ), including sequencing (Sanger, NGS), protein expression (IHC) and amplification (ISH).  Results', '  5,391 NSCLC (293 BM, 5,098 lung), 3,595 breast cancer (99 BM, 3496 breast) and 761 melanoma (101 BM, 660 skin) unpaired samples were included. No significant differences were found in 48 genes between BM and the primary tumor sites, with the exception of PIK3CA in breast cancer, which was mutated less in BM vs. the breast samples (10% vs. 26%, p=0.02). In contrast,  expression of TOP2A, TOPO1 and TS, and amplification of EGFR, were more prevalent in BM as compared to the primary sites (Table).  Conclusions', '  A similar genetic landscape with limited differences was seen in BM of NSCLC, melanoma and breast cancer compared to primary tumors.  The limited differences are more consistent with a linear progression model of cancer metastasis. Additionally ,this suggests that both primary tumor and BM would respond to similar chemotherapeutics with the consideration of effective blood-brain barrier-penetrant drugs. Small molecule inhibitors of EGFR could be considered due to increased EGFR amplification and the higher TOP2A, TOPO1 expression prompts consideration of topoisomerase inhibitors like etoposide or irinotecan.

Methods', ' Pts with exhausted treatment options included in the Copenhagen Prospective Personalized Oncology (CoPPO) research program were selected for targeted therapy against actionable driver mutations identified in freshly obtained tumor biopsies by whole exome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2500).

Results', ' Among 300+ patients included in the CoPPO research program, BRAF V600E mutations were identified in six patients with non-melanoma cancers who received targeted therapy (NSCLC, n = 1; bile duct cancer, n = 3; colon cancer, n = 2). Treatments included BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) alone or in combination with MEK (trametinib) or EGFR inhibitors (panitumumab or cetuximab, colon cancer pts only).

The allele frequency of BRAF V600E increased within the first 24 hours after treatment initiation and subsequently decreased substantially. Dynamics of allele frequency correlated closely to treatment response. In all cases, timing of changes in allele frequency preceded documented radiological treatment response and/or progression. Analyses of tumor biopsies obtained post-treatment are ongoing.

        "Background":"['The clinical development and potent efficacy of selective RAF and MEK inhibitors has transformed the treatment of the 50% of melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations. However, a substantial percentage of these patients fail to respond to therapy, and all who respond eventually develop resistance. We found that suppression of TORC1 activity, as measured by decreases in ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation (P-S6) in response to RAF or MEK inhibitors, was a highly effective predictor of sensitivity in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro and in mouse xenografts. TORC1 and P-S6 were suppressed in response to RAF or MEK inhibitors in sensitive but not resistant melanoma cells, despite robust suppression of the MAPK pathway by these inhibitors. Notably, suppression of P-S6 levels, as assessed by immunohistochemistry in paired biopsies obtained from BRAF mutant melanoma patients before and during treatment, was associated with significantly improved progression-free survival. Finally, we show that changes in P-S6 levels specifically in tumor cells can be readily monitored by multiplexed, quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of fine needle aspiration biopsies obtained from patients before and during the first two weeks of BRAF inhibitor therapy. This provides a minimally invasive means for monitoring the efficacy of treatment in real time, before changes in tumor volume are apparent on traditional radiographs. Together, these results establish changes in P-S6 levels with therapy as a robust biomarker to guide the treatment of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma, and present a powerful methodology for monitoring changes in potentially any signaling pathway in response to therapy in patients.']",

However, despite impressive initial responses, therapeutic effects are often temporary due to acquired resistance. This resistance highlights the need to identify therapeutic approaches to improve the durability of responses to RAF inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel inhibitor of p53-Mdm2 interaction, NVP-CGM097, causes marked reduction of melanoma cell viability. The activation of p53 signaling and consequent reduction in cell viability required wild-type p53, but was independent of BRAF status. Moreover, combined inhibition of Mdm2, using NVP-CGM097, and BRAF using NVP-LGX818, synergistically inhibited the viability of BRAF mutant melanoma cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. NVP-CGM097 caused induction of p21 and Bax, while NVP-LGX818 did not. Instead, NVP-LGX818 caused induction of p27 and Bim. Therefore, together they induced a complementary set of anti-proliferative and apoptosis stimulating molecules, which resulted in strong synergistic antitumor effects. In vivo, the combination treatment resulted in sustained tumor regressions and markedly prolonged survival relative to either single agent. Collectively, these data show that activation of p53, through inhibition of Mdm2, leads to antitumor effects in melanoma. Furthermore, the data show that concomitant activation of tumor suppressor p53 and inhibition of BRAF synergistically suppresses melanoma growth. Therefore, combined inhibition of Mdm2 and BRAF in melanoma may provide an effective therapeutic modality capable of overcoming the resistance observed with the BRAF inhibitor monotherapy and thus lead to more durable responses in the clinic.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and the leading cause of death from skin disease. The BRAF(V600E) mutation is found in approximately 60% of melanomas. It causes constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in these tumors leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) induces apoptosis in melanoma cells which has been used as the basis for molecular targeted therapy of melanoma. Small-molecule compounds such as Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and other selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors specifically bind BRAF(V600E), and have been shown to cause dramatic, but transient, tumor regression in vivo. The precise mechanisms of cell death following BRAF inhibition remain obscure; the literature posits a diversity of ways in which apoptosis is induced. However, it is unclear whether a single but complex network is involved or whether mechanisms differ from one cell type to the next. This is an important issue because use of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma is seriously challenged by the absence of durable responses; even in initially responsive patients tumors usually re-emerge within months and are observed to be drug resistant. An important challenge is thus to understand determinants of initial sensitivity to BRAF inhibition beyond V600E mutation and to determine which of these are involved in resistance.Using high throughput measurement of the abundance and state of modification of multiple proteins representing diverse signaling pathways at the basal level and over time in multiple melanoma cell lines exposed to different doses of BRAF inhibitors and data-driven mathematical modeling, we determine how the complex dynamics of signaling pathways are controlled in different cell lines and how drugs targeting BRAF(V600E) alter this signaling. Our analysis shows that the basal level of some proteins such as PTEN, pERK, pS6, pAkt, and -catenin vary up to 100-fold among different lines prior drug treatment. Further, these cell lines show different degrees of oncogene addiction and remarkable diversity with respect to the level of ERK inhibition and apoptosis as well as activation or inhibition of other signaling cascades following BRAF inhibition. We use mathematical modeling to relate basal levels of signaling proteins and their dynamics following BRAF inhibition to pharmacological descriptors of sensitivity to multiple BRAF drugs. Thus, we identify key signaling nodes within the signaling networks of the melanoma cells which determine the differential phenotypic consequences of BRAF inhibition. This approach will be critical for predicting and ultimately improving drug sensitivity in resistant tumors (e.g. via co-treatment strategies).']",

        "Background":"['Once melanoma has metastasized to distant sites it has proved difficult to treat by a variety of chemotherapeutic and biological agents. Significant advances have been made in identifying subgroups of patients with activating mutations in signalling pathway proteins. In particular, the finding that approximately 50% of melanoma have V600E mutations in the BRAF serine/threonine kinase has resulted in the generation of a number of new drugs which target the mutated active form of BRAF. One of these drugs, Vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG704) has shown significant promise in prolonging survival compared to standard chemotherapy, however reports of patient relapse has prompted investigation into means of overcoming acquired resistance to the agent. We report here that efficacy of the PLX4032 analogue, PLX4720, is greatly enhanced by co-treatment with the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. Treatment with either agent is able to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells, however the kinetics are typically slow, with cell death occurring 48 or 72 hours post treatment. In this study, while either agent was largely ineffective as a single treatment 24 hours following treatment, addition of the combination of drugs rapidly induced significant killing. We show that apoptosis was caspase-dependent, in that inhibition of caspase activation almost totally blocked induction of cell death by the combination of agents. Apoptosis was also associated with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, with reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9. Exposure of melanoma cells to PLX4720 rapidly decreased phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim, resulting in strong upregulation as early as 6 hours after addition of the compound. Strong upregulation of Bim was shown by RNAi knockdown to play an important role in sensitizing cells to co-treatment with ABT-737, by assisting in the inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Further, the combination of agents induced significant levels of apoptosis in melanoma cells derived from patients harbouring the BRAFV600E mutation. Collectively, these results show that the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 sensitizes melanoma cells to apoptosis by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 in a Bim- and caspase-dependent manner. Additionally, these studies identify a potential clinical application for BH3 mimetics in overcoming resistance of melanoma to treatment with BRAF inhibitors, increasing efficacy of this class of agent and improving patient outcomes.']",

        "Background":"['Metabolic reprogramming is considered to be one of the major hallmarks of cancer. Selective inhibitors of mutant BRAFV600E, are a widely used targeted therapy for melanoma. Unfortunately, acquired drug resistance, which commonly occurs, represents a major limitation to clinical efficacy. Recent studies have highlighted the role of BRAF inhibition in promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), over glycolysis, in BRAFV600E melanomas, a switch commonly seen in conjunction with development of drug resistance. This metabolic switch occurs at the transcriptional level, indicated by the up-regulation of PGC1 through the lineage-specific transcription factor MITF. Based on these data, we propose that increased OXPHOS is required for melanoma cells to acquire resistance against the BRAF inhibition, which supports our investigation of the therapeutic benefit of combining BRAF and OXPHOS inhibitors. For the latter, respiratory Complex I, an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a logical target for OXPHOS inhibition.We investigated the molecular, metabolic and bioenergetic effects of a selective mutant BRAF inhibitor (Vemurafenib/PLX4032) and BAY 87-2243, a small molecule inhibiting respiratory Complex I, in vitro using various BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. First, our study revealed that BRAF inhibition increased the expression of mitochondrial genes and mitochondrial respiration, which is associated with elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress, independent of the expression of PGC1. Furthermore, BAY 87-2243 inhibited OXPHOS, down-regulated the expression of mitochondrial genes and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We also demonstrated that inhibition of BRAF increased the OXPHOS phenotype and therefore enhanced the effect of BAY 87-2243 on mitochondrial metabolism; the combination of both inhibitors showed synergistic effects in vitro.Interestingly, long term BRAF inhibition resulted in BRAFV600E melanoma cells to become resistant to BAY 87-2243. Preliminary studies suggest that melanoma cells pretreated with a BRAF inhibitor, with higher rates of mitochondrial respiration and elevated ROS levels, are prone to cell death when targeted by pro-oxidants. Further studies are currently ongoing to understand this resistance phenotype as well as the underlying mechanism which drives the synergistic drug effect.']",

        "Background":"['MAPK pathway dysregulation via mutations in proteins such as BRAFV600E and NRASQ61 is a key feature in melanomas, leading to constitutive ERK signaling. Currently, there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies effective in vemurafenib-resistant BRAFV600E mutant, NRAS mutant, or wild-type melanoma. The effect of SCH722984, an allosteric inhibitor of ERK 1/2, was determined in a panel of 53 melanoma cell lines, including wild-type, NRAS-mutant and vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant BRAF-mutant melanoma. 54% (13 of 24) of BRAF mutants, including 4 with innate vemurafenib resistance, were sensitive to SCH722984 with an IC50 <1M. 100% (3 of 3) of BRAF/NRAS double mutants, 71% (10 of 14) of NRAS mutants and 71% (5 of 7) of wild-type melanomas were sensitive. 13% (5 of 24) of BRAF mutants, 14% (2 of 14) of NRAS mutants and 29% (2 of 7) of wild-type melanomas were intermediately sensitive (IC50 1-1.5M). Among BRAFV600E mutants with in vitro acquired resistance to vemurafenib, those with MAPK pathway reactivation as the mechanism of resistance were sensitive to SCH722984. Combining vemurafenib and SCH722984 in BRAF mutant melanoma was synergistic in a majority of cell lines, resulting in up to 10-fold decrease in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and with combination indices (CI) below 1. SCH722984 inhibited phosphorylation of RSK, an ERK downstream target. Finally, long term cultures of two BRAFV600E-mutant cell lines sensitive to SCH722984 showed that treatment with SCH722984 alone or in combination with vemurafenib was more potent than vemurafenib alone and resulted in a significant delay in developing acquired resistance. SCH722984 may therefore be clinically applicable as a treatment for non-BRAF mutant melanoma or in BRAF-mutant melanoma with innate or acquired resistance, alone or in combination with BRAF inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['The aim of our study was to test the effects of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and BRAF inhibitors on the expression and activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump isoform 4b (PMCA4b) in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. Remodeling of Ca2+ homeostasis during malignancy is caused by the rearrangement of the Ca2+ signaling machinery, including Ca2+ pumps, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and channels. Plasma membrane calcium ATPases (ATP2B - or PMCA) maintain the resting low intracellular calcium concentration by pumping out excess calcium from the cytosol. Changes in PMCA expression during malignant transformation have been described previously in colorectal and breast cancer cells, and most recently by our group in melanomas. We found that in BRAF mutant melanoma cells the PMCA 4b protein level was markedly elevated by BRAF inhibitor treatment. Overexpression of PMCA4b suppressed motility and metastatic potential. Previously, it was shown that HDAC inhibitors-induced differentiation up-regulated PMCA4b expression in gastric, colon and breast cancer cells. In the present study we treated BRAF mutant and BRAF wild type melanoma cells with HDAC inhibitors (SAHA (suberanilohydroxamic acid) or valproic acid) and tested the changes in abundance, localization and function of PMCA4b. Expression levels of the PMCA proteins were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western Blotting. Subcellular localization of the PMCAs and the effects of treatments on cytosolic Ca2+ signaling were analyzed by confocal microscopy. We found that treatment with the HDAC inhibitors increased the level of PMCA4b expression at both mRNA and protein levels in both BRAF wild type and BRAF mutant cell types. The increased PMCA4b level was coupled with enhanced plasma membrane localization and with a faster Ca2+ clearance after stimulation. Our results show that in melanoma cells the expression of PMCA4b is under epigenetic control and HDAC inhibitors efficiently enhanced PMCA4b expression independent of the BRAF status of cells.']",

        "Background":"['Background. Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway is implicated in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor growth. Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in colon, pancreatic, and lung cancers; BRAF mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant melanomas and from 40-60% of papillary thyroid cancers. MEK, a dual specific kinase, is a key player in this pathway; it is downstream of both Ras and Raf and activates ERK1/2 through phosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues. MEK162 (ARRY 438162) is a novel small molecule ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of the kinases MEK1 and MEK2. MEK162 showed promising data in an ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in patients with BRAF and NRAS mutated advanced melanoma. This is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS mutated melanoma. Methods and Results. The melanoma cell line panel was the most sensitive after investigating the growth inhibitory effect of MEK162 on 328 cancer cell lines from diverse histologies including melanoma, head and neck, colon, pancreas, lung, ovarian, liver, kidney, breast and endometrial. When a cutoff of IC50 <500nM or >70% Inhibition at 1uM after 6 days of culture was used 83% out of 47 melanoma cell lines were sensitive to the treatment with the MEK inhibitor. Sensitivity to MEK162 was independent of BRAFV600E andNRASQ61mutation status in this cell line panel. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed upon exposure to MEK162 using flow cytometry. MEK162 led to a G1 arrest and marked increase in apoptotic cells in the majority of the sensitive melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin and oncogenic driver mutations. Western blots were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to MEK162 in the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a decrease in pERK in all the cell lines tested regardless of their mutational status and the in vitro sensitivity. We observed an increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and wild type for NRAS and BRAF mutations cell lines than in BRAFV600Emutant cell lines. We found pAKT and pS6 decreased in the NRAS and BRAF mutant cell lines after treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of the mTOR pathway by MEK162 may be crucial for the sensitivity to the drug. Conclusion. These data provide evidence for supporting the use of MEK162 in the treatment of patients with melanoma.']",

Currently, limited data exist on the sequential treatment with these agents in patients (pts) with the BRAF mutation; here we evaluate the efficacy outcomes of pts enrolled in the EAP in Italy who sequentially received a BRAF-inhibitor and ipilimumab, or vice versa. Methods', '  Ipilimumab was available upon physician request for pts aged 16 years with unresectable stage III/stage IV melanoma who had either failed systemic therapy or were intolerant to 1 systemic treatment and for whom no other therapeutic option was available. Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Tumour assessments were conducted at baseline and after completion of induction therapy using immune-related response criteria. Patients were considered for this analysis if they tested positive for the BRAF mutation and had received a BRAF-inhibitor before or after ipilimumab treatment.  Results', '  In total, 855 Italian pts participated in the EAP from June 2010 to January 2012 across 55 centres. Out of 173 BRAF positive pts, 93 (53.7%) were treated sequentially with both treatments', ' 48 pts received a BRAF inhibitor upon disease progression with ipilimumab and 45 pts received ipilimumab upon disease progression with a BRAF inhibitor.  As of December 2012, median overall survival was 14.5 months (11.1-17.9) and 9.7 months (4.6-14.9) for the two groups, respectively (p=0.01). Among the 45 BRAF inhibitors pretreated pts, 18 (40%) had rapid disease progression (median overall survival', ' 5.8 months) and were unable to complete all four induction doses of ipilimumab, while the remaining 27 (60%) pts had slower disease progression (median overall survival', ' 19.3 months) and were able to complete the therapy with ipilimumab.  Conclusions', '  These preliminary results suggest that, in BRAF-mutated pts, to start the sequential treatment with ipilimumab can provide a better survival than the reverse sequence.

In the current study, we evaluated the pharmacological activity of BI847325, a dual inhibitor of MEK and Aurora kinases against multiple melanoma cell line models.METHODS', ' The cytotoxic effect of BI847325 was evaluated in vitro in a panel of selected BRAF-mutant vemurafenib resistant cell lines by Alamar blue and Annexin V binding assay. 3D spheroid model systems and colony formation assays demonstrated the long-term growth inhibitory effect of BI847325. Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR studies were carried out to evaluate the mechanism underlying BI5-mediated cytotoxicity. In vivo studies in Balb SCID mice were performed to assess the suppression of BRAF-mutant xenografts on treatment with BI847325.RESULTS', ' BI847325 potently reduced the growth and survival of BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines with acquired and intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance (NRAS mutations, BRAF splice forms, Cyclin D1 amplification, RTK upregulation, PTEN loss, COT amplification). We confirmed that BI847325 induced apoptosis through decrease in Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression and increase in BIM expression. The effects of BI847325 upon BIM and Mcl-1 expression could not be mimicked by the combination of other MEK and aurora kinase inhibitors. For the first time we demonstrated that BI847325 reverses the acquired vemurafenib resistance by inhibiting MEK expression at mRNA and protein level. A strong suppression of MEK expression was observed without recovery following 72 h of washout. In vivo studies revealed complete tumor suppression with no recurrence over a period of 65 days of treatment with 70mg/kg/week dose of BI847325. In contrast, treatment with vemurafenib analog PLX4720 in the same mouse model was associated with tumor relapse after 30 days of treatment. BI847325 also successfully suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired vemurafenib resistance. Analysis of tumor samples complied with in vitro results demonstrating inhibition of phospho-ERK, phospho-Histone3, Mcl-1 and total MEK.CONCLUSION', ' In conclusion we report for the first time that BI847325, a novel ATP-competitive MEK/ Aurora kinase inhibitor effectively inhibits BRAF-mutant melanoma and overcomes vemurafenib-resistance by decreasing expression of MEK and Mcl-1; in vitro and in vivo. Further preclinical and clinical investigations towards this would open new avenues in treatment of melanoma.']",
