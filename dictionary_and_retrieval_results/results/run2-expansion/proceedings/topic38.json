        "Background":"['Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioma, and many other cancers. While wild-type IDHs convert isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG), mutant IDHs convert -KG to oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which dysregulates a set of -KG-dependent dioxygenases, such as TETs, histone demethylases, EGLNs, and other enzymes. Because the role of mutant IDH is not necessary for normal cells, inhibitors directed against mutant IDH are expected to have minimum side effects as those of anti-cancer agents.We established a mouse AML model harboring IDH mutations by co-transducing four mutant genes that frequently occur simultaneously in human AML patients. Conditional deletion of the IDH mutant blocked 2HG production and maintenance of leukemia stem cells, resulting in survival of the AML mice. These results indicate that the IDH mutations are critical for the development and maintenance of AML stem cells.Based on these findings, we developed potent and specific inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and tested their effects on the mutant IDH1-dependent AML mouse model, created by introducing four mutant genes including mutant IDH1. The 2HG level was promptly and dramatically decreased in AML cells soon after treatment with the mutant IDH1 inhibitors, and the number of leukemia cells was reduced after a 4-week treatment.To test the effect of the mutant IDH1 inhibitor on glioblastoma, we have established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of glioblastoma carrying IDH1 mutation, and tested the effect of the mutant IDH1 inhibitor on this model. The inhibitor reduced 2HG levels in tumors as well as in plasma. The inhibitor prevented the growth of the tumors with IDH1 mutation. On the other hand, the inhibitor did not affect the growth of the glioblastoma with wild type IDH1. Gene expression analysis identified a set of genes, of which expressions is changed by the IDH1 inhibitor. The most strongly upregulated gene is Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a differentiation marker for astrocytes. Up-regulation of GFAP is confirmed by immune-staining and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. These results suggest that IDH inhibitor induces differentiation of the glioblastoma with IDH1 mutation. We have found that the glioblastoma is transplantable in mouse brain. We are now looking at effects of the inhibitor on this model.Taken together, the results indicate that IDH1 mutant inhibitors are effective for the treatment for AML as well as glioblastoma with IDH1 mutations.']",

        "Background":"['The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 genes are mutated in acute myelogenous leukemia, low-grade glioma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and chondrosarcomas. IDH1 and IDH2 normally function to convert isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate. However, when these enzymes are mutated at select residues the mutant enzymes now convert -KG into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In normal cells, 2-HG levels are typically extremely low, but IDH1/2 mutant cells can accumulate up to 10 mM 2-HG. In an effort to counteract the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH enzymes, we identified and developed potent inhibitors of IDH1. The compounds inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity in biochemical assays and reduce 2-HG production in IDH1-mutant cell lines. Consistent with the fact that 2-HG inhibits -KG dependent enzymes including histone demethylases and Tet family hydroxylases, these IDH1 inhibitors induce a decrease in several histone methylation marks and also DNA methylation. These data demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors can reverse many of the epigenetic effects of mutant IDH1.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) originates from biliary tract epithelium and can be classified anatomically into intrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA. Although a relatively rare disease in the United States and Europe, the incidence of intrahepatic CCA is on the rise with unknown causes. CCA incidence is higher in Asia and the etiology is associated with infections such as liver fluke and hepatitis B/C. Prognosis at diagnosis is poor with median survival time of < 1 year, and only 10-20% of patients are eligible for tumor resection at diagnosis. This study examined the prevalence of MET over-expression, activating single point mutations of KRAS and IDH1/2, and ROS1 gene fusions in 100 intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA FFPE tumor tissues obtained from non-Asian (n=40) and Asian (n=60) patients. Immunohistochemistry performed with an anti-MET-specific antibody (A2) demonstrated that MET is expressed in the majority of all intrahepatic CCA samples analyzed, with 50% of samples reported with membranocytoplasmic scores of 2+ (moderate intensity) or 3+ (strong intensity) on a 0-3+ scale. Interestingly, most non-malignant bile ducts and much vascular endothelia also stained lightly positive for MET. To determine mutation frequencies of KRAS and IDH1/2, competitive allele-specific Taqman PCR (castPCR) was performed on DNA extracted from FFPE CCA tissue (limit of mutation detection 0.1%). Fourteen KRAS activating mutations (G12S, G12R, G12A, G13C, G13S, G13R, G12D, G13D, G12V, G12C, Q61R, Q61L, Q61H (c.183A>C and c.183A>T for Q61H), 5 IDH1 mutations (R132G, R132S, R132H, R132C, R132L), and 5 IDH2 mutations (R172G, R172M, R172K, R172W, R172S) were analyzed. Overall, 25% of analyzed samples were positive for KRAS mutation, and G12D was the predominant mutation (60%). One-third of Asian samples were positive for KRAS mutation, whereas less than one-fifth of non-Asian samples contained KRAS mutations. For IDH1, the frequency of mutation was less than 10% overall, and the majority of patients with IDH1 mutations were non-Asian. The R132C mutation was the predominant IDH1 mutation, and all tissues that were positive for IDH1 mutations were of intrahepatic origin. Interestingly, 2 out of the 7 samples positive for IDH1 mutations (R132C) were also positive for G12D KRAS mutation. There is no trend of MET expression correlating with either KRAS or IDH1 mutations. IDH2 analyses by castPCR and FISH studies examining ROS1 gene fusion are ongoing. Based on these data, inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases and their signaling pathways such as MET and ROS1 may merit clinical evaluation in CCA patients.

However, the currently available fusion genes analysis tools are for Second Generation Sequencing (SGS) data, where the short read length and unreliable alignments can lead to uncertain accuracy of fusion gene detections. Hybrid-Seq, which integrates SGS short read data into the analysis of TGS long read data, can complement the strengths of both and thus improve the overall performance and resolution of the output data. It also reduces the required amount of TGS data and thus the sequencing cost. Recently, we developed and reported on a Hybrid-Seq approach, IDP-fusion and the results of the proof-of-concept application to MCF-7 data. We demonstrated that IDP-fusion can identify fusions genes with much higher precision than SGS-based approaches. Although the sensitivity is comparable to the most sensitive SGS-only method, a significant proportion of experimentally verified gold standard fusion genes had yet to be identified by IDP-fusion. It indicated an opportunity to enhance the sensitivity of IDP-fusion while retaining the unparalleled precision of the results.Method', ' Here we present an innovative Hybrid-Seq approach which extends IDP-fusion, to filtered fusion gene candidates predicted by SGS short read alignments. The fusion gene candidates are verified by the presence of a TGS long read better aligned to an artificial chromosome created from the fusion candidate than any single genome locus. We applied IDP-fusion to a Hybrid-Seq data from the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, including Illumina SGS data and a lately TGS data generated by PacBio P5-C3 sequencing chemistry. The new IDP-fusion considered fusion candidates reported by several popular SGS tools (TopHat-Fusion, SOAPfuse, TRUP, FusionMap, and deFuse). We compared performance of our new tool to the original IDP-fusion, and the SGS-only approaches.Results', ' The new algorithm of IDP-fusion improved the sensitivity from 33.8% to 54.9%.

The improved IDP-fusion retains a precision of 60.9%, which is only down slightly from the original IDP-fusion at 68.6%. This tradeoff is acceptable when considering the overall accuracy described by F-score for IDP-fusion. The F-score has increased from 45.3% to 57.8%, which is also considerably better than the best F-score achieved by SGS-only methods (32.8%).Conclusions', ' Fusion candidates identified directly from SGS reads can be screened using alignments of TGS long reads, and supplement fusion candidates detected from long reads.

Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) are enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG) and the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. Oncogenic mutations in two IDH-encoding genes (IDH1 and IDH2) have been identified in acute myelogenous leukemia, low-grade glioma, and secondary glioblastoma (GBM). Our in silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data combined with wet-bench analysis of tumor extracts indicate that non-mutated IDH1 mRNA and protein is commonly overexpressed in primary GBM. We show that genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of IDH1 decreases GBM cell growth, promotes a more differentiated tumor cell state, increases apoptosis in response to targeted therapies, and prolongs survival of animal subjects bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). On molecular levels, diminished IDH1 activity results in reduced -KG and NADPH production, which is paralleled by deficient metabolic flux from glucose or acetate into lipids, exhaustion of reduced glutathione, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced histone methylation and differentiation marker expression. These findings suggest that IDH1 upregulation represents a common mechanism of metabolic adaptation of GBM to support macromolecular synthesis, aggressive growth, and therapy resistance.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common form of primary brain cancer and remains one of the most devastating of human diseases. One recurrent physiologic states in glioblastoma is defined by mutation of the Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) genes. IDH genes encode enzymes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate. Nearly all IDH mutations in GBM involve substitution of arginine 132 of IDH1 with histidine (IDH1-R132H). The mutant protein loses the capacity to carry out its innate function and instead produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The aberrant production of 2HG, in turn, alters the epigenetic landscape in these GBM cells. While it is clear that IDH1 mutated GBMs harbor a distinct cell state, the signaling cascades contributing to this biology remain poorly understood.Using published mRNA signatures associated with EGFR activation, we demonstrate that IDH mutated GBMs harbored decreased EGFR signaling using four different GBM cohorts, including the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas(CGGA; n = 155), the REMBRANDT dataset (n = 288), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 406), and the UCSD cohort (n = 25). Further analysis revealed that IDH mutated clinical specimens and cell lines harbored lowered mRNA levels for EGFR and H-Ras. These suppressions were associated with increased deposition of the repressive histone markers, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, in the EGFR and H-Ras promoter regions. Finally, the exogenous expression of IDH1-R132H conferred resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, Gefitinib, suggesting IDH1 mutation as a predictive biomarker for EGFR inhibitor response in GBM patients.We further analyzed mRNA signatures associated with p53 activation and DNA damage accumulation in IDH mutated GBMs. We found that that IDH mutated specimens exhibited lowered level of signatures associated with p53 activation, suggesting decreased DNA damage accumulation. We subsequently determined whether this state of lowered DNA damage accumulation is associated with altered sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Exogenous expression of IDH1-R132H in multiple glioblastoma and glial lines conferred increased resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). This resistance is associated with decreased accumulation of -H2AX. Consistently, we found that in a prospective glioblastoma registry of 274 GBM patients, IDH mutation is associated with poor response to TMZ (p<0.001).In contrast to EGFR and p53 signaling, where IDH mutation is associated with pathway suppression, we found an association between elevated MYC expression and IDH mutation in both clinical specimens and cell-line models. Moreover, exogenous IDH1-R132H expression is associated with increased sensitivity to agents that suppress MYC expression, including LSD1 inhibitors. These results suggest potential therapeutic opportunities to target IDH mutated GBMs through epigenetic modulation of MYC expression.']",

We tested the in vitro anti proliferative activity of CB839 in chondrosarcoma cell lines carrying a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), a key enzyme in TCA cycle. These cell lines included JJ012 (IDH1 mutant) and SW1353 (IDH2 mutant). CH2879 cell line carrying wild-type IDH was used as a control. In addition to IDH mutant chondrosarcoma cell lines, we tested in vitro efficacy of CB839 in a panel of soft tissue sarcoma cell lines including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), Ewing sarcoma (CHP100) and Liposarcoma (LS141). Results from our in vitro proliferation assay showed that compared to wild-type IDH cell line CH2879, mutant IDH cell lines JJ012 and SW1353 were more sensitive to inhibition of proliferation by CB839. Among the soft tissue sarcoma cell lines tested, MPNST and ST8814, which carry an NF1 mutation (neurofibromatosis 1) or NF1 loss respectively, showed greater sensitivity to inhibition. NF1 negatively regulates Ras activity and NF1 mutation or loss in these cells is known to up regulate Ras/MAP kinase pathway. The extent of sensitivity observed in soft-tissue and chondrosarcoma cell lines correlated with their extracellular glutamine dependency. This was confirmed by cell proliferation assay in glutamine containing versus glutamine depleted media. Target inhibition by CB839 was confirmed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, which showed reduced levels of intracellular intermediary metabolites including Glutamate, -ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate and 2-hydroxy-glutarate. Previous reports have suggested that -ketoglutarate is a rate limiting factor in the activation of mTORC1. To explore whether CB839 affects mTORC1 signaling, we carried out western blot analysis to determine the phosphorylation levels of S6 (pS6), a direct substrate of mTORC1 activity. We observed down regulation of pS6 by CB839 only in IDH1 mutant cell line, JJ012, but not in wild-type IDH cell line, CH2879. This data strongly supports cross-talk between glutamine metabolism and mTORC activity in IDH mutant cell line. Some reports have suggested that under conditions of glutamine deprivation, cells use pyruvate carboxylase for anapleurosis. Treatment of chondrosarcoma cell lines by CB839 showed dose dependent suppression of pyruvate carboxylase only in IDH mutant but not wild type cell line.

Specifically, histone hypermethylation is rapidly reversed within days whereas reversal of DNA hypermethylation proceeds in a progressive manner over the course of weeks. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed several pathways involved in tumorigenesis of leukemia and lymphoma, indicating a selective modulation of relevant cancer genes by IDH mutations.

The mutant IDH enzyme gains a new function producing D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). 2-HG is a small molecule that accumulates in IDH mutant gliomas as high as 5 to 35 mM and is considered the principal effector of IDH mutation in cancers. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an approved method in brain tumors to identify and quantify metabolites within brain lesions by using signals emitted by proton nuclei (1H). The 2-HG molecule has five nonexchangeable scalar-coupled protons that give rise to multiplet resonances in MR spectra. First attempts to measure 2-HG in IDH mutant glioma have been promising but were limited to scanners dedicated to research MRIs, long scanning times, and large tumors. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of performing 2HG-MRS as part of standard glioma imaging.We developed single and multivoxel spectroscopy techniques using unique alterations of pulse sequence parameters and software routines on clinical 3Tesla MRI scanners. We added those sequences to our clinical MRI protocol. All metabolites, including 2-HG, were estimated by linear combination of model (LC Model). 107 consecutive glioma patients were evaluated, including 48 (45%) WHO grade II glioma, 40 (37%) grade III glioma and 19(18%) grade IV glioma. 80/107 (75%) patients had IDH mutant gliomas.

In the group of IDH-mutant tumors with a tumor volume 8cc, 2-HG MRS was positive in approximately 35% of the untreated patients and in approximately 30% of the treated patients. For a subset of patients we measured dynamic changes in 2-HG over time (multiple times MRS). A drop in 2HG-MRS signal was associated with treatment response.2-HG MRS in the clinical setting is feasible. Specificity was 100%. Sensitivity appears, at least in part, dependent on tumor volume with higher sensitivity in larger tumors.

Dysregulation of metabolism has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of cancer. A significant proportion of patients with glioblastoma and hematological malignancies harbor the mutated forms of the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2. The mutated forms of IDH1 and IDH2 produce an oncogenic metabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). A recent study of breast cancer patients showed that D2HG can also be produced in the absence of mutated IDH, through an alternative route involving over-activated MYC signaling. We developed a novel methodology to computationally analyze gene expression in colorectal cancer, and identified novel sets of genes that are associated with patient survival. The study of OxPhos-related genes revealed that an imbalance between the expression of IDH1 and IDH2, defined as overexpression of one isoform in relation to the other, was associated with worse prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. This effect was further accentuated by reduced expression of the beta-oxygenation enzyme, 3-D-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase (HCDH) 4, which has been reported to contribute to metabolism of intracellular D2HG. The present computational analysis revealed a novel and potential mechanism of colorectal cancer development, through over-production of D2HG when there is an imbalance between IDH1 and IDH2 expression, resulting in decreased clearance of D2HG when the beta-oxidization pathway is diminished. Additional validation analysis with other gene expression dataset has resulted in that IDH1/2 imbalanced expression had a shorter DFS compared with balanced expression. Altogether, these findings provide a strong rationale for studying this mechanism further in order to discover novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of colorectal cancer.']",

Pathologically, primary liver cancer can be classified into 90% hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 510% intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and the combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC/CC) representing only a small portion. Clinically, ICC and cHCC/CC show much more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis than HCC, and no standard treatment currently exists, other than surgical resection. ICC and cHCC/CC show varying degrees of biliary epithelial differentiation, which can be defined as liver cancer displaying a biliary phenotype (LCB). To gain insight into molecular alterations of LCBs, we performed whole genome sequencing analysis on 30 LCBs. Here we show the genome-wide substitution patterns of LCBs developed in chronic hepatitis livers overlapped with those of 60 HCCs, while those of hepatitis-negative LCBs diverged. The subsequent validation study on 68 LCBs identified recurrent mutations in TERT promoter, chromatin regulators (BAP1, PBRM1 and ARID2), a synapse organization gene (PCLO), IDH genes and KRAS. The frequencies of KRAS and IDHs mutations, which are associated with poor disease-free survival, were significantly higher in hepatitis-negative LCBs. This study reveals the strong impact of chronic hepatitis on the mutational landscape in liver cancer and the genetic diversity among LCBs.']",

These point mutations specifically affect IDH1 and IDH2 active site arginine residues and confer the ability to reduce -ketoglutarate to R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), an oncometabolite that competitively inhibits -ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes, such as histone and DNA demethylases. Accumulating evidence indicates that mIDH enzymes are attractive targets for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. To validate potential mIDH inhibitors in a cellular assay, we acquired several cell lines that harbor mIDH1 R132H and R132C', ' HCT116 mIDH1 (colon cancer, mIDH1 R132H +/-, Horizon Discovery), U87 MG mIDH1 (glioma, m IDH1 R132H +/+, Japan), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma, mIDH1 R132C +/-) and JJ012 (chondrosarcoma, mIDH1 R132C +/-, Rush University Medical Center). Cell lines were sequenced to confirm the presence of mIDH1 and 2HG production was measured in cellular supernatants by GC-MS. We observed that cells harboring mIDH1 R132C produce higher amounts of 2HG compared to lines harboring mIDH1 R132H, in agreement with recent reports. In addition, we show that accumulation of 2HG is time dependent and that its half-life in cellular supernatant is over 48 hours. Moreover, we demonstrate that 2HG is a stable analyte in media (through five sample free-thaw cycles) and that our samples are within linear range, providing a good intra-assay and inter-assay variability (CV <10%). Using this assay we evaluated the impact of five reference compounds obtained from published structures (Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge MA), on the accumulation of 2HG in the supernatant of HT1080. These compounds were reported to have different ranges of activity against mIDH1 R132H and R132C enzymes in in vitro assays. Four of the mIDH reference compounds significantly inhibited 2HG accumulation in HT1080 supernatants in a dose dependent fashion, with potencies that were comparable to enzyme inhibition values. In agreement with previous reports, none of compounds affected HT1080 proliferation over a 48 hours incubation. In conclusion, we have identified mIDH cellular models that produce differing concentrations of 2HG, detectable by a GC/MS assay with sensitivity sufficient to determine levels as low as 0.1g/ml. We have tested several inhibitors of the mIDH enzyme and confirmed an association between in vitro enzyme inhibition and a decrease in 2HG accumulation; therefore this assay can be used for the cellular evaluation of novel mIDH1 inhibitors.Funded by NCI Contract No. HHSN261200800001E.

As there are few in-vivo model systems for IDH-mutated tumors we have created a transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model expressing mutant IDH1. We have chosen the zebrafish as a model because they are transparent (allowing monitoring of the transgene in-vivo) and drug screening assays are straightforward (they are simply added to the aquarium).IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C, mutations found in tumors that both produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) instead of alpha ketoglutarate, were cloned into an expression construct that is driven either by the Nestin or GFAP promoter. IDH1G70D (a loss of function mutation), IDH1wildtype and GFP were used as control. All IDH1 constructs were fused to GFP for visualization. These constructs were injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the one-cell stage.All of our transgenic zebrafish lines remain healthy and produce offspring. Transgene expression was detected in the mid/hindbrain of the central nervous system by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-QPCR. A significant increase in the level of D2HG was observed in all transgenic lines expressing IDH1R132C or IDH1R132H, but not in any of the lines expressing control constructs (IDH1wildtype, IDH1G70D or GFP). In contrast to reported, we failed to detect any differences in hydroxymethyl cytosine (the first step in DNA-demethylation) and mature collagen IV levels between wildtype and mutant IDH1 transgenic fish. We also performed microinjections on fertilized eggs to screen for early developmental effects of IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C. Despite of the high expression of the transgene, no developmental effects were found. Our observations therefore suggest that elevated levels of D2HG are insufficient to initiate tumorigenesis or other phenotypic effects in our fish. Treatment of the transgenic zebrafish with an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AGI-5198, resulted in a reduction in the D2HG level in the mutant zebrafish. The L2HG level was not affected by AGI-5198. As no tumors were formed in our transgenic zebrafish lines, we backcrossed them with Tp53 mutant fish. Analysis of these lines is currently being performed.In summary, we have generated a transgenic zebrafish model system that expresses mutated IDH1 that can be used to study effects of mutant IDH1 (or elevated levels of D2HG) in vivo and can be used for drug screening.']",

        "Background":"['The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) family of enzymes is central to cellular metabolism, catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG) and production of NADPH. Recently, cancer-associated heterozygous somatic mutations in family members IDH1 and IDH2 were discovered and present predominantly in glioblastoma multiforme and acute myeloid leukemia. The major consequence of these point mutations is the biochemical production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2-HG] from -KG. Recent studies indicate that unalike mutations of IDH2 produce different intracellular levels of (R)-2-HG, suggesting that IDH2 mutations may differentially influence tumorigenesis. Contrasting clinical studies find IDH mutations to be associated either with increased metastatic potential, or higher survival and enhanced chemosensitivity probabilities. Nevertheless, these studies failed to indicate specifically which of the various IDH mutations were found in each of the patients tumors. This raises important questions as to whether specific IDH mutations contribute differently to tumorigenesis. In this study, specific IDH2 mutations were evaluated and compared for their chemosensitivity, tumorigenic activity, and production of (R)-2-HG- all notable determinants for their potential use as tumor biomarkers. Three individual clinically relevant IDH2 mutations (IDH2-R172K, -R172M, and -R140Q) or IDH2-WT were expressed in human U87MG glioblastoma cells. We observed distinct changes in cell morphology, proliferation, migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Differences in base-line activation of various stress pathways were also observed, lending a plausible explanation to the differing phenotypic outcomes. Interestingly, the variable levels of endogenous (R)-2-HG produced by the cell panel inversely correlated with their respective growth rates, implicating (R)-2-HG as a negative regulator of tumor growth. Indeed, treatment of tumor cell lines, expressing IDH2-WT, with exogenous (R)-2-HG induced a decrease in cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. When tested in vivo, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with (R)-2-HG significantly reduced tumor volume. These in vivo results complement the results of soft-agar colony forming assays, demonstrating again that (R)-2-HG inhibits tumor growth. In contrast, immortalized cells subjected to long-term (R)-2-HG treatment showed enhanced cell proliferation. Their response to (R)-2-HG, however, could be switched from growth promotion to that of growth inhibition through expression of oncogenic Ras. Thus, these findings demonstrate conclusively that IDH2 mutations are not alike and that oncometabolite (R)-2-HG plays dual roles in tumorigenesis.']",

Recurrent somatic mutations in the genes encoding for the metabolic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 have recently been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemias, chrondrosarcomas, cholangiocarcinomas and glioblastomas. Point mutations in IDH lead to production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG acts as a potent inhibitor of enzymes involved in the removal of chromatin marks associated with transcriptional repression (DNA and Histone H3K9 methylation). Excess 2HG leads to impaired differentiation but very little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here we use a well established model of cellular differentiation, the differentiation of 10T1/2 fibroblasts into myofibers by the lineage-specifying transcription factor MyoD to study the mechanisms by which IDH mutations impair differentiation. We show that 5-azacytidine induced differentiation of 10T1/2 cells is impaired when mutant IDH2 is expressed and that IDH2 mutations impair the ability of MyoD expression to reprogram 10T1/2 cells into myofibers. We propose that the metabolic landscape of undifferentiated cells determines the ability of the lineage determining factor MyoD to trigger differentiation and that the undifferentiated state of cancer cells is dependent on their unique metabolic profile. Further work aims to a) define the effects of mutant IDH1/2 on the ability of MyoD to program muscle differentiation, b) determine the nature of the tumorigenic effects of IDH1/2 mutations in 10T1/2 cells and c) identify molecular pathways that can overcome differentiation blocks upon activation. Insight from these experiments will outline the mechanism(s) by which metabolic alterations, in the form of 2HG, impair differentiation and drive tumorigenesis. They will also serve as a platform for the identification of metabolic alterations that trigger differentiation.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for mutant-IDH1-mediated transformation', \" due to its structure similarity with alpha-ketoglutarate (-KG), (R)-2HG can inhibit -KG-dependent enzymes that act as tumour suppressors such as TET2 or EGLN, (R)-2HG might inhibit electron transport chain function, or rapid (R)-2HG generation may deplete the cellular pool of -KG leading to depletion of NADPH. Recently, it has also emerged that IDH1 may be required to catalyse a series of back reactions through TCA cycle components (reductive decarboxylation) to facilitate fatty acid synthesis from media glutamine, particularly under hypoxic conditions. According to some reports in the literature, heterodimer formation between mutant an wild-type alleles of IDH1 is important for the production of high levels of (R)-2HG.We were interested in exploring novel ways to target tumour cells bearing mutant IDH1 alleles that were distinct from the obvious opportunity available to identify mutant-specific IDH1 inhibitors. The potential metabolic vulnerabilities of mutant IDH1 cancers raised the possibility that wild-type IDH1 might be essential for tumourigenesis or tumour maintenance in this context. We therefore employed Horizon's rAAV-mediated homologous recombination gene engineering technology to generate conditional knockouts of the IDH1+ or IDH1R132C alleles in the fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080. Despite several attempts, we did not recover a correctly targeted conditional knock-out of the IDH1R132C allele. However, we did recover a derivative cell line where the wild-type allele had been converted into a loxP-flanked IDH1R132C allele, and two independent clones where the wild-type allele had been flanked with loxP sites. Interestingly, in these latter two clones, no expression of wild-type IDH1 was detectable.Here we present data characterising the growth of these clones under a variety of culture conditions, including the hypoxic state where IDH1 has been proposed to be important for enabling lipid synthesis from glutamine. We also demonstrate that HT1080 cells that express no detectable levels of wild-type IDH1 retain the ability to be tumorigenic in immuno-compromised mice.

We then assessed the effect of IDH1i on the metabolome of endogenous IDH1 mutant glioma cells using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We further investigated specifically perturbed metabolic pathways using lentiviral knockdown and overexpression systems.Results', ' We found that IDH1i exposure and the resulting 2-HG depletion had a mixed effect in 12 endogenous mutant IDH1 lines studied both in vitro or in vivo, including an orthotopic glioma xenograft model. For 10 of 12 lines, IDH1i treatment had no demonstrable effect on proliferation or survival, while 2 lines displayed growth inhibition after IDH1i treatment. However, no significant changes were detected in the genomic DNA methylation profiles or the global levels of histone tail marks including H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in IDH1 mutant glioma lines, even after inhibition of mutant IDH1 for 12 months in vitro. Broader metabolite profiling revealed that inhibition of mutant IDH1 significantly altered levels of the canonical metabolite NAD+. We tested the effect of NAD+ depletion using NAD+ biosynthesis inhibitors, and found that endogenously mutant IDH1 cells were highly dependent on NAD+ for survival, whereas proliferation and survival of IDH1/2 wild-type cancer cells were unaffected by NAD+ depletion. Using an inducible mutant IDH1 expression system we discovered that mutant IDH1 reduced intracellular NAD+ levels, rendering mutant IDH1 cells susceptible to further NAD+ depletion. Lack of sufficient NAD+ induced metabolic crisis with reduced ATP levels in IDH1 mutant cells, triggering the intracellular energy sensor AMPK and autophagy. In vivo, NAD+ depletion significantly extended the survival of mice bearing IDH1 mutant xenograft tumors, including intracerebral gliomas.Conclusions', ' Although most IDH1 mutant cell lines derived from solid cancers were resistant to direct IDH1 inhibition, a subset of IDH1 mutant cancers were found to be sensitive.

Recently, using an untargeted discovery approach and validation of key metabolites, we characterized the metabolomic profile of human breast tumors and uncovered intrinsic metabolite signatures in these tumors. Importantly, the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), accumulated in a subset of tumors and human breast cancer cell lines. 2HG reached millimolar concentrations comparable to those in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas, despite the absence of IDH mutations. Instead, we discovered a significant association between increased 2HG levels and MYC pathway activation in breast cancer, which was corroborated in human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells with inducible MYC overexpression and knockdown. Further analyses showed a global increase of DNA methylation in 2HG-high tumors and identified a poor survival tumor subtype with distinct DNA methylation, high tissue 2HG, and heightened occurrence in African-American patients. Tumors of this subtype had a stem cell-like transcriptional signature with WNT and MYC pathway activation. These tumors over-expressed glutaminase, suggesting a functional relationship between glutamine and 2HG metabolism in breast cancer. Accordingly, 13C-labeled glutamine was metabolized into 2HG in cells with aberrant 2HG accumulation, whereas pharmacologic and siRNA-mediated inhibition of glutaminase markedly reduced 2HG. Our findings highlight 2HG as a candidate breast cancer oncometabolite associated with MYC activation and poor prognosis.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is mutated in various types of human cancers, predominantly an arginine to histidine amino acid change at codon 132. This structural alteration drives the catalysis of -ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which enhances DNA and protein hypermethylation and cellular dedifferentiation. Pharmacologic inhibitors of the mutant IDH1 protein show promise in clinical trials, yet the regulation of IDH1 has not been fully elucidated. We recently discovered in wild type IDH1 tumors that the regulatory RNA-binding and stress response protein, HuR (ELAVL1), protects cancer cells under nutrient deprivation by regulating the expression of core metabolic enzymes, including IDH1. We mapped the regulatory HuR binding site on the IDH1 transcript to the 3-untranslated region. Since wild type and mutant IDH1 alleles both contain this binding sequence, we hypothesize that HuR is an important regulator of both isozymes and is biologically important in mutant IDH1 tumors.Methods', \" HuR expression was suppressed by siRNA in a fibrosarcoma cell line (HT-1080) harboring a natural heterozygous IDH1 mutation and cell viability was determined by PicoGreen and Trypan blue exclusion assays. Sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of the mutant IDH1 protein was assessed. Sanger sequencing and mRNP-IP were performed to determine HuR's impact on the expression of each IDH1 allele. To further characterize the post-transcriptional regulation of IDH1 by HuR, CRISPR/CAS 9 editing of the HuR gene was performed.Results\", ' Sanger sequencing of IDH1 after depletion of HuR in HT1080 cells, as well as after HuR mRNP-IP, revealed that HuR regulates both the mutant and wild type IDH1. Drug sensitivity assays to a mutant IDH1 inhibitor (AGI-5198) under varying glucose concentrations revealed glucose deprivation to be a novel driver of chemo-resistance. However, HuR silencing abrogated HT1080 resistance to AGI-5198 under these conditions. Targeted knockout of HuR using the CRISPR/CAS9 system resulted in potent suppression of mutant and wild type IDH1, at both the mRNA and protein levels when compared to CRISPR/Cas9 control.Conclusions', ' These findings reveal that harsh metabolic conditions present in the tumor microenvironment induce chemo-resistance in an IDH1 mutant cell line to a mutant IDH1 inhibitor, in an HuR dependent manner. Moreover, both mutant and wild type IDH1 alleles are potently regulated by HuR. Therapeutic strategies that target the HuR-IDH1 axis and block this resistance mechanism may enhance the efficacy of mutant IDH1 inhibitors for relevant tumors.']",

Using this model, we performed a suppressor screen for kinases and found brain-specific dCdk5 partially reverses the tumor phenotype. dCdk5 and its human ortholog CDK5 (79% identity) are atypical protein kinases because they do not regulate cell cycle in normal cells, but are critical for neurogenesis & survival of mature neurons. Interestingly, many cancers show overactivation of CDK5 signaling, regulating cell cycle & leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Our analysis of TCGA data shows that IDH wt GBM has significantly high level of CDK5 compared to the IDH wt lower grade glioma.

To examine the effects of this metabolic defect on the epigenome, we used Illumina GoldenGate and 450K Infinium microarray technology to profile DNA methylation in GIST samples and uncovered markedly divergent global DNA methylation between SDH-null GIST (N=24) versus KIT or related tyrosine kinase pathway mutated GIST (N=39). When compared to reference normal tissues including intestinal smooth muscle (N=10) and neuronal tissue (N=13), SDH-deficient GIST was found to have an order of magnitude greater global hypermethylation than the kinase-pathway mutant group (84.9K vs. 8.4K targets, respectively). In a histologically distinct SDH-deficient tumor system, methylation divergence was further found among SDH-mutant paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma (N=29) using an adrenal tissue (N=15) reference baseline. These data expose an essential role for succinate metabolism in the maintenance of DNA methylation programming and tumor suppression. Because defects in other Krebs cycle enzymes are also oncogenic, we further sought to determine whether this phenomenon was confined to SDH-deficient tumors. Analysis of SDH-mutant GIST and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas revealed comparable quantities of global hypo- and hypermethylated targets. We propose that this phenomenon may result from a failure of maintenance demethylation, secondary to inactivation of the TET2 5-methylcytosine dioxgenase system by the inhibitory metabolites succinate (in SDH deficient tumors) or 2-hydroxyglutarate (in IDH mutant tumors).

In line with the proposed mode of action, a concentration-dependent lowering of 2-HG was observed in vitro accompanied by differentiation and maturation of mIDH1 tumor cells. Furthermore, BAY 1436032 showed a favourable selectivity profile against wtIDH1/2 and a large panel of off-targets in vitro.To the best of our knowledge we were able to show for the first time single agent in vivo efficacy in mIDH1 patient derived glioma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma solid tumor models with this clinical candidate along with monitoring of intratumoral 2-HG levels as a predictive biomarker.

Previous reports have shown that the interaction of DNA methylation and histone modification regulates gene expression. In the present study, we hypothesized that concurrent inhibition of histone acetylation and DNA methylation could result in decreased viability of chondrosarcoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. To test this, we used a panel of chondrosarcoma cell lines including IDH wild type (CH2879), IDH1 mutant (JJ012) and IDH2 mutant (CS1) cell line. Results from our in vitro proliferation assay showed that combination of sub-IC50 concentrations of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor Decitabine (5-AZA-dC) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (SAHA) resulted in decreased cell viability of all the three chondrosarcoma cell lines tested when compared to either drug alone. Western blot analysis showed induction of cleaved Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP), a known marker of apoptosis. Consistent with augmented DNA damage, combination of Decitabine and SAHA markedly increased the levels of phospho-H2AX, a DNA damage marker, and pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bim. Combination treatment also resulted in increased induction of histone acetylation (AcH3) and increased expression of E-Cadherin. Previous reports have shown that E-cadherin is critical for apoptosis and depletion and inhibition of E-Cadherin impairs apoptosis induction via DR4 and DR5 death receptors. To this end, we showed that induction of cleaved PARP by Apo2L/TRAIL stimulation decreased over time when E-Cadherin was knocked down by siRNA. Xenograft studies using IDH2 mutant (CS1) tumor model showed a significant suppression of tumor volume when animals were treated in combination with SAHA and Decitabine compared to single agent treatments. Taken together, our data strongly suggests that combination treatment with SAHA and Decitabine is a novel treatment approach and merits evaluation in the treatment of chondrosarcoma.']",

RRVs selectively infect cancer cells due to cell division requirements for virus integration into the genome and defects in innate and adaptive immune responses found in cancers that support virus replication. Toca 511 spreads through cancer cells and stably delivers the gene for an optimized yeast cytosine deaminase that converts the prodrug Toca FC (an investigational, extended-release formulation of 5-fluorocytosine) into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU kills infected cancer cells that are dividing, diffuses and kills surrounding cancer cells as well as myeloid derived suppressor cells and tumor associated macrophages, thus reestablishing immunity to tumor. Methods', ' In this phase 1 trial (NCT01470794), ascending doses of Toca 511 were injected into the resection bed of patients with recurrent high grade glioma undergoing resection, followed by oral administration of courses of Toca FC 5-7 weeks after Toca 511 injection. Additional cohorts included combination of Toca 511 & Toca FC with bevacizumab or lomustine. Results', ' Objective responses (ORs) are observed in IDH1 wildtype (wt) and mutant (mt) phenotypes, including 3 complete responses (CRs) (2 IDH1 mt and 1 IDH1 wt) and 2 partial responses (2 IDH1 wt) for patients treated with Toca 511 & Toca FC, and 1 CR (1 IDH1 mt) for a patient treated with Toca 511 & Toca FC and bevacizumab. ORs are observed 6-19 months after Toca 511 injection and are consistent with an immunologic mechanism.

RNA sequencing data and a series of protein-RNA interaction assays proved that HuR stabilizes transcript levels of the NADPH producing enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). HuR-knockout cells had near-complete loss of IDH1 expression (manuscript under review). In light of the fact that IDH1-null mice are particularly sensitive to oxidative damage, we hypothesize that this enzyme plays a critical role in PDA survival of acute stress. We examined the expression levels of all eight well-characterized NADPH-generating enzymes in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, and demonstrate that only IDH1 and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) are upregulated by >2-fold after incubation in low glucose (5 mM) for 48 hours. IDH1-knockout MiaPaCa2 cells were generated through CRISPR gene editing, such that mRNA expression was detected at <5% of control levels. ROS levels detected by DCFDA measurements were increased by 55% in IDH1-knockout cells compared to isogenic controls under normal culture conditions, with even higher levels under low glucose and chemotherapy stress for 48 hours. Additionally, IDH1-knockout cells were more sensitive to chemotherapy under both high and low glucose conditions, compared to IDH1-proficient control cells. Taken together these results suggest that IDH1 expression is important for acute antioxidant defense in pancreatic cancer cells in the face of metabolic stress, and represents a potential therapeutic target.']",

Objectives for this abstract were to 1) characterize the PK profile of AG-120 and the relationship between AG-120 exposure and 2-HG suppression, and 2) evaluate the influence of intrinsic patient factors on AG-120 clearance, in patients with mIDH1 CC. Methods', ' AG-120 was administered orally once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) in continuous 28-day cycles. As of Dec 5, 2016, 60 of 73 patients enrolled with mIDH1 CC had PK/PD samples available for analysis at 100 mg BID, 300 mg QD, 400 mg QD, 500 mg QD, 800 mg QD, and 1200 mg QD in dose escalation (n = 24) and 500 mg QD (n = 36) in dose expansion.

Results', ' Following both single and multiple doses, AG-120 plasma exposure increased less than dose proportionally from 100 to 1200 mg. Mean terminal half-life was 38.485.8 h, supporting a QD dosing regimen. Following multiple doses, steady state was reached within 15 days, with approximately 2-fold accumulation in plasma AG-120 exposure. No patient-specific factors were identified as clinically significant covariates affecting AG-120 plasma clearance. After multiple doses, plasma 2-HG levels were reduced (up to 98.4% inhibition, achieving levels similar to those in healthy volunteers) and tumor biopsy 2-HG levels were also substantially reduced (by up to 99.9%) at all dose levels tested. The 500 mg QD dose resulted in the largest magnitude of 2-HG inhibition vs. other dose levels. Conclusions', ' AG-120 demonstrated a long half-life in patients with mIDH1 CC and robustly inhibited 2-HG in plasma and tumor samples.

Methods', ' NGS was performed for all patients diagnosed with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type (IDH-WT) GBM at our institution since September 1, 2016. Our panel performs targeted exome sequencing of 153 cancer-related genes (+/- 10 bp at intron/exon boundaries) and detects insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide variants at an allele frequency of 2%.

To avoid upward skewing of mutational load due to the panels preferential detection of genes recurrently mutated in cancer, alterations with known or likely functional disruption per the COSMIC database and/or our internal variant knowledge base were also not counted. The number of mutations counted was divided by the coding region target territory of the NGS panel (~0.5 Mb) to extrapolate mutational load to the whole exome.

Cancer is not a single disease but diseases of complex genetic components and oncogenic processes. Limited number of PDX models with minimal genetic characterization is insufficient to meet current research needs. For this, we have built the largest and most comprehensive PDX library with full genetic profiles. By far, our PDX library contains over 1,100 models derived from patients of both Asian and Western origins, covering over 20 major cancer types, including large panels (over 100 models each) of NSLCL(1), CRC(2), gastric(3), HCC(4), and pancreatic, and smaller panels (<100) of esophageal, H&N, ovarian, cholangiocarcinoma, breast, brain, etc. Our PDX models come with original patient and pathology diagnosis information, and verified at the level of histopathology and genetic fingerprints. These models have tumor growth and standard of care (SOC) treatment information. They are fully profiled using GeneChip based technology (U219, SNP6.0, miRNA), NGS (RNAseq and WES), and hotspot mutation, etc (HuPrime 1.0), with HLA typing readily available to enable immuno-oncology research. Comparing our PDXs genomic profiles with published patient genomic profiles in literature (4) and TCGA data source (Guo et al., 2015 AACR Annual) revealed high degree of similarity. Subsets of models have been comprehensively characterized for special relevance to specific clinical characteristics and specific drug targeting mechanisms (HuPrime 2.0). These subsets include all clinically observed EGFR mutated NSCLC(1, 5, 6); c-MET activation diseases(7); FGFR driven diseases; RET-fusion driven CRC(8); FLT3-LTD driven AML (9), IDH mutated AML(9) and CRC; RSPO-fusion driven CRC; BCL-ABL fusion disease, HER driven gastric and breast cancers, and ALK fusion NSCLC, etc. We have also established numeric drug resistant models to various SOCs of both chemotherapy and target therapies. The resistance could be de novo (1) or induced (10). These resistant models can be great tools to investigate drug resistant mechanisms and approaches to overcome them. Many PDXs can also been tested orthotopically, including liver, brain, colon, pancreatic, ovarian, and breast etc. Models have great metastatic potential have also been identified, enabling study metastatic mechanism and identifying agents to block the metastasis. A number of PDXs can grow in humanized mice (HuPrime 3.0), where human immunity has been reconstituted in the immune-compromised mouse background (11) to facilitate immune-oncology research.Our large library of different disease panels are particularly useful in conducting mouse clinical trial (MCT of HuTrialTM) (2, 5, 12), which can be used to discover predictive biomarker (2, 5, 13) and guide clinical study design.']",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapped to 8q24 have been shown to be associated with glioma development. Recently, we identified seven SNPs (through tag SNP genotyping/imputation, pooled next-generation sequencing using long-range PCR, and validation SNP genotyping) that are highly associated with the risk of developing glioma. After stratifying by histologic and tumor subtype, one SNP, rs55705857, in the 8q24.21 region near CCDC26 was significantly associated with oligodendroglial tumors and IDH mutated astrocytic gliomas with high odds ratios (ORs 6.0) (Jenkins et al. Nature Genet. 44', '1122;2012). By array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), a significant proportion of oligodendroglial tumors and IDH mutated astrocytomas have been shown to duplicate 8q24 (Kitange et al., Genes Chr Cancer 42', '68;2005; Nousmehr et al. Cancer Cell 17', '510;2010). We were interested in learning if the germline risk allele of rs55705857 is associated with gliomas that duplicate 8q24. We were also interested in learning if the risk allele is preferentially gained in gliomas that duplicate 8q24. Methods', ' We performed aCGH on 217 tumor samples. rs55705857 germline genotype was available on 120 of the patients; of which 30 carried the risk (G) allele. In addition, we sequenced the rs55805857 region in 48 gliomas, 15 of which exhibited gain or duplication of chromosome 8, 8q, or 8q24. The ratio of the Sanger-sequencing peak heights at and around rs55705857 was used to determine which allele (risk or wild-type) was gained. Results', ' All 15 duplications included rs55705857 and the immediately adjacent regions. Of the 30 patients who carried the germline risk (G) allele for rs55707857, 8 (26.7%) exhibited duplication of 8q24 upon aCGH analysis of their glioma. Of the 90 patients who only carried the wild-type (A) allele, 7 (7.5%) exhibited duplications of 8q24 upon aCGH analysis of their glioma. This difference in proportion is statistically significant (p=0.024, Fischer exact test). Of the 15 tumors with duplication of 8q24, 8 came from patients who were germline rs55705857 heterozygotes (AG). Of these 8 germline heterozygotes with duplication of 8q24, 4 gained the risk (G) allele, 2 gained the wild-type (A) allele and 2 exhibited gain of both alleles in their tumor specimens. Conclusions', ' While the results require replication, our data suggest that carrying the risk allele for rs55705857 predisposes to the development of gliomas that subsequently duplicate 8q24. However, gliomas with duplication of 8q24 do not preferentially gain the risk rs55705857 allele.

Interestingly, A-CIMP was enriched in CEBPA (19%) and WT1 mutations (14%), but inversely correlated with IDH, TET2, and NPM1 mutations. Functional pathway analysis revealed that genes hypermethylated in A-CIMP are associated with pluripotency maintenance - including PAX6, GBX2, and HOXA9 - and RNA-seq data largely, but not entirely, recapitulated methylation-based patterns. There was a strong correlation between promoter CpG island methylation and gene expression for many A-CIMP genes. Finally, the transcriptional program associated with A-CIMP was found to correlate with outcome and genetic backgrounds in both TCGA and additional independent datasets.Conclusions', ' Taken together, our data suggest that CIMP in AML is complex, multifactorial and cannot be explained solely by coding gene mutations (e.g. IDH1/2, TET2).

CIMP is also present in many cancers. In glioblastoma, CIMP is associated with IDH mutations and malfunction of ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes which mediate DNA demethylation. However, IDH and TET mutations are rare in CRC and the mechanism behind CIMP in CRC remains elusive. Recently, our lab reported that Fusobacterium was enriched in CIMP+ CRC cases. In the current study, we explore if there are other CIMP associated microorganisms (CAM) in CRC, and if CIMP is caused by microbial metabolites. Methods', ' Whole genome sequencing was performed on 25 human CRC (16 CIMP+ and 9 CIMP-) and 19 adjacent normal tissues. The reads that did not map to the human genome were aligned to a microbiome sequence database downloaded from Human Microbiome Project. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to look for CAM. To confirm CAM, qPCR was performed on additional samples. In addition, a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was developed to detect 2-Hydroxygluterate (2HG), an inhibitor of TET enzymes, in candidate bacteria. Results', ' 1) Unsupervised clustering and Spearman correlation of microbiome data generated two distinct sample groups. One contained 13 cases, all CIMP+ CRC (CIMP+ enriched group, G1). The other had 6 CIMP- CRC and 17 adjacent normal tissues (CIMP- and adjacent normal tissue enriched group, G2). 2) Volcano plot and statistical analysis revealed that 656 and 1051 species/strains were present in G1 and G2, respectively. 3) There was greater (p<0.05) microbial diversity in G2 (>90 species, including bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotes) than in G1 (16 species, all bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most of them belong to Family Enterobacteriaceae). 4) qPCR showed that for CIMP1 CRC, 11/44 (25%) were positive for Klebsiella sp. including 7 (15.9%) that were positive for K. pneumoniae, while only 1/27 (3.7%) CIMP2, 2/45 (4.4%) CIMP0 CRC, and 2/49 (4%) adjacent normal tissues were positive for Klebsiella sp.. 5) We used qPCR to test for pks+ (enterotoxin associated with E. coli and K. pneumoniae) bacteria. Pks was found in 16/83 (19.3%) CRC, including 13/51 (25.5%) CIMP+ CRC, 3/32 (9.4%) CIMP- CRC and 6/66 (9.1%) adjacent normal tissues. 6) MRM detected 2HG production in Fusobacterium nucleatum cultures but not in K. pneumoniae or E.coli.

Therefore, functional analysis of each heterogenous cells and their role in tumor pathogenesis are critical. To investigate the cellular origin of population diversity, we established 4 subclones from a IDH1 wild type GBM patient. These subclones were subsequently propagated and analyzed. All clones expressed stem cell makers (nestin, sox2, musashi) heterogeneously. The morphology, self-renewal and proliferative capacities of the subclones were varying. FACS analysis showed that high CD133 expression clones tended to have high proliferation and invasive capacities. Most of these clones cells expressed high level of CD44, an adhesion molecule in cancer stem cells regulating redox status in cancer cells. Surface expression of CD24 and CD56 showed statistically different pattern. However, these 2 did not enhance their morphology, proliferation capacities and tumorigenesis.

Our previous study demonstrated that STK17A, a serine-threonine kinase in the death-associated protein family, is a bona fide p53 target gene. In silico analyses indicated that STK17A is highly overexpressed in GBM patients in a tumor grade-dependent manner. Furthermore, high STK17A expression correlated with poor clinical outcome and decreased survival of patients from multiple datasets. This correlation was independent of age, tumor subtype and known biomarkers such as EGFR, NF1, and IDH, suggesting STK17A may contribute to GBM development and progression.In vitro experiments confirmed increased mRNA and protein expression of STK17A in GBM cells compared to immortalized normal human astrocytes and other cancer types. ShRNA mediated STK17A knockdown in GBM cells decreased cell survival and sensitized cells to genotoxic stress. In addition, STK17A knockdown led to reduced tumor cell proliferation and clonogenicity, suggesting a tumor-promoting role for STK17A in GBM. Interestingly, STK17A depletion resulted in a cell morphological change from a spindle-like phenotype to a phenotype with a flattened, enlarged and more rounded shape that was associated with induction of actin stress fibers. This cytoskeleton remodeling was associated with impaired cell migration and invasion. In contrast STK17A overexpressing cells displayed a pronounced needle-like elongated phenotype. In addition genome-wide expression analysis of STK17A knockdown GBM cells revealed regulation of genes involved in glycolysis including PKM2, PGAM1 and HK2, suggesting that STK17A may also promote tumor growth and survival through regulating metabolism.

This causes metabolic rewiring that is not fully understood and in vitro studies have shown that IDH1MT cancer cells rely on glutaminolysis, providing cells with α-KG via activities of glutaminase (GLS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD). Here, we first show by in silico analysis of 269 IDH1 wild-type (IDH1WT) and 408 IDH1MT gliomas, obtained from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, that IDH1WT gliomas have high expression levels of genes encoding for enzymes that are involved in glycolysis and acetate anaplerosis. On the other hand, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, rather than glycolytic lactate production, is the predominant metabolic pathway in IDH1MT gliomas and is driven by lactate and glutamate anaplerosis to facilitate production of α-KG, and ultimately D-2-HG. IDH1WT- and IDH1MT-related differences in expression were found in both LGG and glioblastoma. Furthermore, via in situ enzymatic activity mapping, we show in human gliomas and in xenocraft models that GLUD activity is increased and GLS activity is decreased in IDH1MT glioma, indicating that IDH1MT gliomas depend on glutamatolysis, rather than glutaminolysis. We show that transcript levels in our xenocraft models are in good agreement with our in silico analysis of the TCGA database. Finally, we confirmed the glutamate dependency of IDH1MT gliomas by MRS-flux analysis, whereas IDH1WT gliomas show high lactate production. Taken together, we show that IDH1WT gliomas have a typical Warburg phenotype and rely on acetate anaplerosis whereas IDH1MT gliomas are glutamate and lactate dependent. This metabolic rewiring in IDH1MT glioma, enables targeting of glutaminolysis rather than direct inhibition of IDH1MT for therapy. It diminishes the supply of glutamate-derived α-KG and directly inhibits the production of D-2-HG and simultaneously worsen the redox status of the glioma cells by inhibiting NAD(P)H production by GLUD.

Glucose consumption or production of lactate and ATP were also increased in CMPM or CMBMDM. Then we monitored lactate producing rate with seahorse energy metabolism detector, and found that either CMPM or CMBMDM produced lactate faster than that of control. Moreover, inhibition of LDHA activity by oxamate ( inhibitor) also decreased glucose consumption and lactate production. Importantly, the expression of Arg1 and CD206, positively correlated with glycolysis and function of TAMs. Finally, we search the underneath mechanism and found PI3K/AKT pathway was activated in CMPM or CMBMDM. In detail it was found that p-p85 and p-AKT was upregulated at 8 hour after 4T1 supernatants stimulation. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway by LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), notably inhibited the expression of glycolysis genes and markers of TAMs, which indicated that PI3K/AKT pathway maybe involved in glycolysis of TAMs. Together, we identified that TAMs adopted glycolysis as a major way to consume glucose and glycolysis was directly contributed to the phenotype and function of TAMs, which was regulated by PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.']",

Recent study has revealed that aberrant expression of IDH1 contribute to chemotherapy resistance. However, the role of IDH1 in metformin induced chemotherapy sensitivity is not well characterized. As a critical enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, IDH1 catalyzes isocitrate to produce -ketoglutarate (-KG), a substrate of TET1, which control TET1-mediated epigenetic modulation of the target genes, including the chemotherapy-resistant genes. In the present study, we have found that IDH1 is overexpressed in endometrial cancers compared with benign endometrial lesions and normal endometria by immunohistochemical analysis of specimens (200 cases of endometrial cancers, 10 cases of benign endometrial lesions and 10 cases of normal endometria). Tissue microarray immunohistochemical detection showed the expression of IDH1, TET1 and 5hmc was positively correlated in different pathological types of endometrial tissue.

Furthermore, overexpression of IDH1 increased TET1 at protein level and blocked metformin-sensitized endometrial cancer to chemotherapy drugs, whereas decrease IDH1 expression lessened TET1 expression and paralleled with the attenuated chemotherapy-resistance. Mechanistic investigations revealed that TET1 involved in metformin-enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity via IDH1 by western blotting and DNA dot blotting assays, this may attribute to that reduced production of -KG resulted from metformin-suppressing IDH1 is not enough to start TET1-mediated epigenetic modulation of chemotherapy resistant genes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that IDH1 regulates -KG level and TET1 expression, which in turn affecting metformin mediated endometrial cancer chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Our study suggests IDH1 is a potential target to overcome cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in endometrial cancer.']",

The identification of IDH1 as a major cancer gene in glioblastoma provides a great opportunity for improving our understanding, diagnostics and treatment of this disease. Recent studies from our laboratory characterized the genetic landscape of gliomas and have shown the cooperation between IDH1 mutations and other oncogenic alterations including TP53 mutations. Normally, IDH1 functions in the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate, however, the mutant form confers neomorphic enzymatic activity by producing D-2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite responsible for aberrant methylation in IDH1-mutated tumors. To determine the role of mutant IDH1 in vivo, we generated a conditional knockin mouse model that produces D-2-hydroxyglutarate. This genetically faithful system is biologically and clinically relevant and will promote the understanding of mutant IDH1-mediated tumorigenesis while offering a route for therapeutic targeting.We observed that broad expression of mutant IDH1 throughout the brain leads to hydrocephalus in 80% of animals. To obviate these deleterious effects, we restricted expression of mutant IDH1 to the neural stem cell population. Animals were sacrificed after one year, at which time we observed mild hydrocephalus in several animals. Recapitulating the genetics of human tumors, we sought to determine the synergistic effects between mutant IDH1 and deletion of P53. We observed development of low- and high-grade gliomas in approximately 14% of animals. Tumors developed in both P53 deleted animals as well as in mutant IDH1/P53 deleted animals, with mutant IDH1 expressed in tumors of the latter cohort. Differences in latency, penetrance, differentiation, and epigenetic modifications are being assessed. Additionally, we are determining the cell fate of IDH1-mutant cells over time to assess the biological effects of the mutation on the behavior and differentiation of neural stem cells. Lastly, to decrease the latency and increase the penetrance of tumor formation, an orthotopic intracranial injection model is being generated to allow for visualization of tumor formation and development, as well as investigation of therapeutic modalities. Understanding the biological effects of the most common mutations found in gliomas will bring us strides closer to determining mechanisms and therapeutic targets for IDH1-mutated cancers.']",

Heterozygous mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes have been identified in a specific subset of cancers. Mutations typically affect the enzyme active sites at codon R132 in the IDH1 gene, and R140 or R172 in the IDH2 gene. This confers neomorphic enzyme activity that produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate that is involved in cancer initiation and progression. The detection of IDH1/IDH2 mutations has important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications and testing for these variants is being incorporated in clinical settings. In fact, the identification of IDH1 or IDH2 gene mutations is now required for the classification of tumors of the central nervous system under the 2016 WHO guidelines. Therefore, there is a significant need for an IDH1 + IDH2 test that can be performed in a rapid manner to support clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions. A strategy utilizing allele-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) is well suited for evaluating a small number of hotspot variants in IDH1 and IDH2 from clinical tissue samples in a matter of few hours. Using RNase H2-dependent PCR (rhPCR) and a universal reporter system, we have developed new multiplex qPCR assays that effectively discriminate between closely related sequences that differ by only a single nucleotide base at the same position or adjacent position in a single tube reaction. In addition, the rhPCR mechanism of the assays also greatly reduces the impact of primer-primer interactions, further improving the multiplex capability of the assays. During initial testing, specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity were evaluated. Mutations present in patient samples at frequencies as low as 2% were identified with high reproducibility. The assays have been tested across 49 patient samples that included FFPE tissue, blood, and bone marrow aspirate with results that are concordant to those found using an orthogonal method of next generation sequencing.

However a small percentage of these patients live considerably longer. Extensive genetic and epigenetic analysis has identified IDH1 mutation, G-CIMP (Glioma-CpG Island Methylator Phenotype) phenotype and MGMT as markers of better survival in glioblastoma. These markers though can only be associated with a small fraction of long term survivors (defined as glioblastoma patients surviving >3 years), underlying the need for better biomarkers of improved survival. Epigenetic analysis of inter-tumoral heterogeneity in the TCGA glioblastoma cohort identified a truncated form of the novel ZMZI1 gene to be associated with improved survival in patients hypermethylated in the alternative promoter of the truncated ZMIZ1 form, in an independent manner from IDH1, G-CIMP or MGMT methylation status.A validation cohort of 31 glioblastoma long term survivors with low prevalence of the known markers IDH1, G-CIMP and MGMT showed that ZMIZ1 methylation was positive in 42% of the patients, more sensitive and specific than IDH1, G-CIMP or MGMT. Extending our analysis to lower grade gliomas as well as other central nervous system tumors showed that higher methylation of the truncated ZMIZ1 was predicting a more favorable outcome in astrocytomas but not in oligodendrogliomas. Furthermore, in non-CNS tumors including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma, lower expression of the truncated ZMIZ1 form predicted a favorable survival, statistically significant in univariate and multivariate analysis adjusting for tumor stage and grade. In vitro loss of function and gain of function studies showed that ZMIZ1 is significantly affecting migration of glioblastoma cell lines, leaving unaffected the proliferation capacity of these cells. Loss of function studies showed that decreased ZMIZ1 expression in glioblastoma is resulting in higher sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolamide.These results identify a novel pan-cancer biomarker of prognosis as well as a new gene that could potentially play a key role in cancer pathogenesis and resistance to treatment.

To find potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, we analyzed the spectrum of genomic alterations in over 700 confirmed glial tumors. Extracted DNA was subjected to hybrid capture for 236 cancer-related genes plus 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer, and sequenced to a median depth of >500x. Resultant sequences were assessed for base substitutions, insertions and deletions, copy number changes, and select rearrangements. Glioblastomas showed frequent alterations in CDKN2A/B (55%), TP53 (40%), PTEN (40%), and EGFR (40%), including EGFRviii (18.6%). Anaplastic astrocytomas harbored frequent alterations in TP53 (65%), IDH1 (55%), and ATRX (51%). Astrocytomas, including both low grade and mixed grade tumors, had a similar genomic landscape to that of anaplastic astrocytomas with frequent alterations in TP53 (53%), IDH1 (45%), and ATRX (36%). In addition to known fusions involving EGFR, FGFR3, and BRAF, we also identified rare, but therapeutically relevant, fusions involving ROS1 and PDGFRA that have been reported exclusively in lung cancer and hypereosinophilic syndrome, respectively. Unsupervised clustering of all glial tumors based on genomic alterations identified six distinct classes each driven by unique combinations of genomic events. Tumors driven by concurrent alterations in IDH1, ATRX, and TP53 were associated with younger age and anaplastic astrocytoma histology (p = 2.21016). The addition of NF1 alterations to IDH1, ATRX, and TP53 mutations was modestly enriched in glioblastoma samples (p = 0.04). Other classes showed distinct drivers (MAPK or PI3K pathway alterations) coupled with unique mechanisms of cell cycle deregulation (CDKN2A/B loss, CDK4/MDM2 amplification, or RB1 alterations). The potential clinical importance of these genomic findings was demonstrated in three patients with surgically confirmed recurrent glioblastoma who received molecularly-matched targeted inhibitors as part of second-line therapy. Patients with activation of EGFR via amplification or mutation (R108K), activation of the mTOR pathway via inactivation of NF1, and constitutive activity of BRAF (V600E) were treated with erlotinib, everolimus, and vemurafenib, respectively, administered in combination with chemotherapy. In all three cases, imaging responses and overall survival were deemed far greater than expected by the treating physician. In conclusion, complex genomic data from glial tumors can be grouped into distinct sub-classes driven by unique combinations of alterations.

Distinguishing driver events from passenger events will be a key challenge for the realization of targeted therapy. To elucidate driver mutations that are clinically actionable, the Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy at MD Anderson cancer center has developed a NGS clinical sequencing platform, T200, to sequence 202 cancer-related genes at high depth in thousands of cancer patients at MD Anderson.Materials and MethodsThe T200 mutation data, including single nucleotide variants (SNV, variant allele frequency >=1%) and copy number variations (CNV), of more than 500 cancer patients treated in MD Anderson Cancer Center were utilized in our study.Results1.

Some sets such as KRAS/APC/SMAD4 contain driver genes from multiple signaling pathways, which may indicate essential mechanisms for tumor development and nominate targets for combinational therapy.2. We elucidated mutual-exclusive mutations that were from genes in the same or different pathways. Several sets of well-known mutual-exclusive SNVs were verified in our analysis such as BRAF/NRAS SNVs in melanoma. We also illustrated novel sets of mutual-exclusive mutational events, such as IDH1/PTEN/PPP1R3A SNVs in brain tumors and EGFR/FGFR3/GNAS/NOTCH4 CNVs in all cancers.3. SNVs of more than 10 genes were enriched in specific cancer types, such as IDH1 and NF1 in brain tumor, BRAF and MITF in melanoma. CNVs of more than 50 genes were found enriched in one cancer type, such as PDGFRA amplifications in brain tumors and IL6R amplifications in breast cancer. We observed not only expected cancer specific mutations such as BRAF SNVs but also novel mutations such as NF1 SNVs and PDGFRA amplifications.4. We performed mutual-exclusivity and cancer type enrichment analysis on SNV hotspots.

The murine J2 retrovirus contributes to oncogenesis in macrophage cells. The BV-2 microglia cells were immortalized using the v-raf/v-myc carrying J2 retrovirus. These cells, however, do not form tumors when grown in vivo in the natural C57BL/6 host. Consistent with v-raf/v-myc expression, the in vitro metabolic and proliferation rate of the BV-2 cells greatly exceeded that of the tumorigenic and metastatic VM-M3 microglia cells when grown in DMEM containing 25 mM glucose. When controlling for proliferation and ATP production, the BV-2 cells produced more lactate than did the VM-M3 cells under aerobic conditions, thus demonstrating a robust Warburg effect in the BV-2 cells. The Warburg effect is associated with HIF stabilization under aerobic conditions. Mutations in the IDH1 gene produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a recognized onco-metabolite that also contributes to HIF stabilization under aerobic conditions. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the non-tumorigenic BV-2 cells made 2-HG only under anoxic conditions. 2-HG was not detected under anoxia or normoxia in VM-M3LM cells, a less malignant clonal variant of VM-M3. It appears that the BV-2 cells have a more robust cancer metabolism than either the high malignant VM-M3 cells or the low malignant VM-M3LM cells. The VM-M3LM cells consumed more oxygen and produced less lactate per ATP than did either the BV-2 cells or the VM-M3 cells, thus displaying a reduced Warburg effect. In other words, the Warburg effect was greatest in the non-tumorigenic BV-2 cells, was lowest in the low malignant VM-M3LM cells, but was intermediate in the high malignant VM-M3 cells. The results suggest that over expression of the v-raf/v-myc oncogenes, production of the IDH1 onco-metabolite, and a robust Warburg effect are not sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in the BV-2 cells.

        "Background":"['Background', \" HuR is an RNA-binding protein that translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm with its mRNA cargo in response to stress, and regulates mRNA stability and translation of these transcripts. HuR has been implicated as an important regulator of pro-survival pathways in cancer, and increased cytoplasmic expression of HuR has been observed in numerous cancer types. The regulatory mechanisms of metabolic pathways under metabolic stress are poorly understood. We investigated HuR's role in regulating pancreatic cancer metabolism.Methods\", ' We measured HuR cytoplasmic expression in pancreatic cancer cells in response to glucose deprivation. Ribonucleoprotein precipitation (RIP) of HuR was performed to survey candidate metabolic mRNA targets. HuR levels were depleted with siRNA oligos under metabolic stress, and effects on cell survival, biochemicals in the media, and metabolic enzyme targets were determined. Experiments were performed in MiaPaca2, BXPC3, Panc1 cell lines.Results', ' Cytoplasmic protein expression of HuR was increased by immunoblot and immunofluorescence after 6 hours of glucose deprivation in all 3 cell lines (vs. 25 mM glucose). In addition, HuR depletion with siRNA impaired survival in of all 3 cell lines in low glucose media (<10 mM) at 7 days by PicoGreen. Overexpression of HuR had a protective effect under glucose deprivation in Panc1 cells. Surprisingly, HuR depletion resulted in increased glucose uptake in MiaPaca2 and BxPC3 cells. RIP-qPCR and immunoblot experiments ruled out GLUT1 as a mediator of this effect. In all 3 cell lines, lactate production decreased with HuR depletion. RIP assays of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism identified 11 novel metabolic targets of HuR in MiaPaca2 cells', ' glycogen metabolism (GBE1, GSK3); glycolysis (GPI, PGK1, HK2); Krebs cycle (IDH1, IDH3A, CS); and pentose phosphate pathway (PRPS2, RPIA, and RPE). Validation RIP-qPCR was performed for 3 enzymes (GPI, IDH1, PRPS2) in BXPC3 and Panc1 cells. In addition, HuR depletion resulted in decreased mRNA expression of these 3 genes in MiaPaca2 cells. Decreased protein expression of these 3 targets was observed in each of the cells lines. Incubation of MiaPaca2 cells in 1 mM glucose resulted in increased cytoplasmic HuR protein expression at 12 hours, and increased protein levels of all 3 metabolic targets at 48 hours.Conclusions', ' HuR cytoplasmic expression is critical for pancreatic cancer cell survival under glucose deprivation. HuR likely supports a Warburg phenotype characterized by increased lactate production. Surprisingly, HuR activation led to decreased glucose uptake. Novel metabolic targets of HuR were identified, and coordination of these targets may be responsible for the observed findings. Improved understanding of how HuR acutely regulates metabolism in response to stress should uncover novel therapeutic targets against pancreatic cancer.']",

Whole exome sequencing was done in CSF and tumor (n = 3) and was coupled with digital PCR for monitoring CSF and plasma ctDNA (n = 6). Targeted capture massively parallel sequencing of 39 samples from 4 BMBC pts, including samples from CSF, plasma and matched metastatic sites obtained at autopsy was performed using two independent platforms (MSK-IMPACT (341 genes) and BC panel (254 genes most frequently mutated in BC)) comprising 488 unique genes. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000. Single nucleotide variants were defined using MuTect, and indels using Varscan. Copy number alterations were assessed using Varscan2 and GISTIC.Results', ' Whole exome sequencing of tumor and CSF DNA revealed a high proportion of tumor-derived cell-free DNA in the CSF of 3 pts (1 GBM, 2 BMBC). We identified actionable somatic mutations (EGFR L858R, IDH1 R132H) and also IDH1 mutations associated with molecular diagnosis of proneural GBM. In CSF and plasma ctDNA of 6 pts with GBM, BMBC, BMLC, we observed that the mutations present in the CSF ctDNA, but not plasma ctDNA, and their mutant allele fractions (MAFs) correlated with brain tumor burden. In 3 pts with suspected LC, we compared the results of cytopathologic analysis and CSF ctDNA obtained from samples used for cytopathologic diagnosis, and observed that CSF ctDNA was more robust and sensitive for the diagnosis of LC. The analysis of synchronous CSF ctDNA, plasma ctDNA and intra- and extra-cranial metastases from 4 autopsied BMBC pts showed that CSF ctDNA recapitulated the somatic genetic alterations present in the intra-cranial lesions. We detected similar MAFs for the truncal mutations (RB1, KMT2D, AHNAK2) in both CSF and plasma DNA of BMBC3, a pt with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and a diagnosis of concurrent BMBC and esthesioneuroblastoma; however, mutations in PIK3CB, PAK7, MSH5 found only in the CNS implant of each disease were only detected in the CSF but not in the plasma DNA.Conclusions', ' Brain tumor-derived ctDNA is abundantly present in the CSF of brain cancer pts and compared to plasma ctDNA, CSF ctDNA is more representative of the brain lesions.

Despite its genetic homogeneity, there is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical course of this disease, probably due to epigenetic events that follow the initial translocation.Material and methods', ' We performed whole-transcriptome next-gen paired end sequencing of 7 Xp11 RCC samples, 10 clear-cell RCC and 19 papillary RCC. In addition, we performed genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of 9 Xp11 samples by Digital Restriction Enzyme analysis of Methylation (DREAM), based on next-generation sequencing.Results', ' Using a robust bioinformatics pipelines, we confirmed 6 previously known TFE3 translocation partners, and discovered a novel partner involving the splicing gene LUC7L3 that we validated by RT-PCR. Unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiling revealed genetic homogeneity of Xp11 cases that clustered together, independently from clear-cell and papillary RCC subgroups. Ingenuity analysis confirmed MITF activation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed mTOR pathway activation. In contrast with genetic homogeneity of gene expression, unsupervised clustering analysis of CpG sites located within CpG islands (CGI) revealed', ' (1) a CpG islands methylator phenotype (CIMP+) subgroup related to patients with metastatic disease (n=3), and (2) a CIMP negative (CIMP-) subgroup related to patients with local disease (n=6). Integrative analysis showed that genes with differentially methylated levels between CIMP+ and CIMP- tumors (SD', ' +/-20%) and which were down-regulated in CIMP+ subtype as compared to normal kidney, were also down-regulated in CIMP- subgroup . Of note, FZD10 and CCDC8 were found to gain promoter methylation in three cases of Xp11 RCC, but their baseline expression was already low in normal kidney. In contrast, small gain of promoter DNA methylation in cancer samples was associated with gene silencing of putative tumor suppressor genes. Interestingly, GSEA for gene body methylation identified enrichment of MAPK signaling pathway in CIMP+ versus CIMP- cases. Exome-sequencing of 2 out of 3 cases with CIMP+ phenotype identified non-synonymous IDH1 (p.V71I) mutation present in COSMIC database for one case and a frameshift mutation of the chromatin remodeling enzyme INO80D in the second case.Conclusion', ' Our data reveal uncoupling of DNA methylation and gene expression profiling in Xp11 RCC.

The latter have come into focus because of their interesting characteristics', ' they have a more favorable outcome and better response to chemo/radiotherapy. This is correlated with a unique unbalanced translocation der(1;19)(q10;p10) causing a codeletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm of chromosome 19. Like the other lower grade gliomas, a large percentage of oligodendrogliomas carry the IDH1 R132 mutation and this is associated with the presence of the codeletion. We identified a high number of mutations in the remaining alleles of the Capicua homolog gene (CIC) and in the far upstream element binding protein (FUBP1) in 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas (Eisenreich et al. 2013, doi', '10.1371/journal.pone.0076623). Both genes are suspected to act as tumor suppressor genes. We then analyzed the expression profiles of 13 oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas both with the 1p/19q codeletion (nine samples) and without (four samples) using a combination of expression microarrays and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our results showed that all nine samples with the 1p/19q codeletion carried the heterozygous IDH1 R132H mutation while only one tumor without the codeletion carried said mutation. There was a high concordance between the results of RNA-Seq and the microarray experiments and both showed a distinctive expression signature between samples with the 1p/19q codeletion and those without. Using MSigDB, we found that the genes whose expression was altered in in tumors with the 1p/19q codeletion showed significant overlap with those involved in stemness and differentiation and genes that had CpG-rich promoters. Furthermore, there was an overlap with genes with altered expression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). When we compared the expression of genes located on 1p and 19q between the tumors with the 1p/19q codeletion and those without, we found that only 82% of genes on 1p and 19q were downregulated significantly. When we ran the upregulated genes in PathScan, we found enrichment in GA binding protein alpha (GABPA)binding sites. GABPA expression levels were increased in our glioma samples with and without the 1p/19q codeletion. Investigating the expression levels of GABPA in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM dataset also revealed an upregulation of this transcription factor. An increase in GABPA-mediated transcription was recently reported in CML but has not been yet reported in gliomas. We therefore propose that GABPA is an important transcription factor in gliomas. We are currently evaluating the function of GABPA in glioma what will also be presented.Acknowledgements', ' This project was partially supported by a MeDDrive grant of the Medizinische Fakultt Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitt Dresden.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Benzyl isothiocyanate mediates glucose uptake through AKT activation in breast cancer cells",
        "Background":"['We have shown previously that benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) administration retards the development of mouse mammary tumors driven by Her-2 oncogene proving in vivo evidence for its chemopreventive efficacy. However, we also observed an increase in glucose uptake by tumor in BITC treatment group compared with control mice. Proteomics using tumors from control and BITC-treated mice revealed changes in proteins related to metabolism. Thus, we studied the mechanism by which BITC increases glucose uptake using four cell lines with different genetic backgrounds (e.g., ER+, ER-, HER-2+, triple negative). Consistent with in vivo findings, BITC treatment enhanced the protein levels of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT4) regardless of ER, HER-2 or p53 status. On the other hand, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was downregulated in response to BITC treatment. Pyruvate kinase (PKM2) as well as tricarboxylic cycle (TCA cycle) related enzymes (IDH1, PDH, MDH) were upregulated in BITC treated cells compared with control. In agreement with these results, BITC treatment increased glucose, pyruvate, and acetyl-CoA levels but decreases lactate level. These results suggested that elevated glucose after BITC treatment was largely utilized through TCA cycle. Because AKT is known to regulate tumor metabolism including glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, we explored its involvement in BITC-mediated metabolic alterations. To our surprise, BITC treatment resulted in a marked increase in activation of AKT. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT antagonized BITC-mediated increase in GLUT1 expression as well as increase in glucose and pyruvate levels. In addition, AKT inhibition augmented BITC-mediated inhibition of cell survival (colony formation), induction of apoptosis, and suppression of migration in human breast cancer cells. Based on these findings, we propose that mammary cancer chemopreventive efficacy of BITC may be augmented by a combination regimen involving an AKT inhibitor. This study was supported by the grantCA129347 awarded by the National Cancer Institute.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Analysis of cancer-initiating mosaic mutation in germline samples of pediatric cancer patients by next generation sequencing",
        "Background":"['A cancer predisposition mutation can occur during post-zygotic stages resulting in a mosaic mutation pattern across tissues. Mosaic germline mutations such as those affecting RB1, TP53 and AKT1 are important for clinical testing. However, it is challenging to detect mosaic mutation by genome-wide sequencing approaches as a mutant allele present at a low fraction in a germline sample can be caused by either tumor-in-normal contamination or mosaicism. Here we propose a two-step analytical approach to distinguish between these two possibilities. The first involves assessing the level of tumor-in-normal contamination using all clonal somatic mutations identified through the analysis of tumor purity and chromosome ploidy. The second step determines the probability of mosaicism for a candidate variant by calculating the binomial probability of its mutant allele fraction (MAF) under the contamination hypothesis. We applied this process to 1,172 paired tumor-normal pediatric cancer samples analyzed by whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing. Six mosaic variants were identified, including three pathogenic TP53 mutations with a mutant allele fractions (MAF) ranging from 0.2 to 0.3, one RB1 mutation in a retinoblastoma case with a MAF of 0.08, one IDH1 p.R132H mutation in an acute myeloid leukemia case with a MAF of 0.21, and one mosaic RYR2 p.E1690D mutation in an osteosarcoma case with a MAF of 0.11. At the same time, we were able to reject three candidate TP53 variants caused by contamination with MAFs ranging from 0.06 to 0.33. All predicted mosaic mutations were verified by ultra deep sequencing at 10,000X coverage. This experience demonstrates the feasibility of detecting germline mosaicism from whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing of paired tumor-normal samples and would caution accurate analysis of tumor-in-normal contamination when evaluating candidate germline mosaicism.']",

        "Meeting_name":" SLC6A15, a novel potential metabolic target for non-small cell lung cancer",
        "Background":"['Current therapeutic targets for non-small cell lung cancer consist only of signaling pathways targeting VEGF, EGFR or ALK. Recent researches have put focus on understanding cancer metabolism (such as 2-hydroxyglutarate accumulation in gliomas with mutant IDH1) and have opened a new avenue in cancer therapeutics which can complement the current practices. Here we introduce a new potential metabolic target for non-small cell lung cancer, SLC6A15. It is a trans-membrane protein known to facilitate uptake of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) (leucine, isoleucine and valine) and proline into the cells. BCAA was recently reported to increase cellular proliferation by regulating m-TOR in normal cells like beta-pancreatic cells. Here we show that these BCAA are highly enriched in lung tumor cell lines (H1299 & H460) as well as in human lung tumor tissues as a result of overexpression of SLC6A15. We performed a transient knockdown of this transporter using siRNA for SLC6A15 and observed its effect on reduced clonogenicity of the two cancer cell lines by 3.3 and 1.6 fold, respectively. Further, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the cells treated with si(SLC6A15) revealed selective reduction of BCAA levels by 1.3 to 1.5 fold but not in Proline, which can be synthesized in the cells unlike BCAA. These results support the role of these amino acids in tumor cell proliferation. Overexpression of SLC6A15 protein was confirmed by western blot analysis in 8 NSCLC cell lines and is indicative of its tumor specific nature. This finding is also supported by SLC6A15 gene expression data available on TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), where 6 out of 10 patients show high expression of this gene. Therefore, we conclude that SLC6A15 is a new candidate of therapeutic target for NSCLC. Targeted inhibition may open new possibilities to specific reduction of tumor cell proliferation and possibly, increase life expectancy of patients suffering from NSCLC.']",

        "Meeting_name":" HP1-gamma's expression correlates with glioma grade and survival and is a putative marker of glioma stem like cells",
        "Background":"['Genetic and signaling pathways involved in the development of glioblastoma have been relatively well characterized. Gene/protein expression profiles of glioblastoma have been described that reflect stem-like phenotype of the tumor. However, no reliable individual markers exist up-to-date that differentiate glioblastoma stem-like cells from the neural stem cells. Glioblastoma appears to be of heterogenous cellular population, but detailed cellular origin of these tumors is unknown. Using a label-free proteomic approach, we analyzed two different glioma models with proven de novo tumorigenic properties, and compared them with primary neurospheres. Of almost 2000 identified proteins, we found 482 to be significantly differentially expressed among the three groups. Among the identified substrates, the clusters of proteins with highest density of protein-protein interactions were functionally enriched in RNA processing related to development and metabolic processes. We then focused on two putative quantitative markers of glioma stem-like cells, HP1-gamma (Heterochromatin Protein 1- gamma) - CBX3 (chrome box 3), an epigenetic regulator involved in RNA processing, and LDHA (Lactate Dehydrogenase A), a key metabolic enzyme of anaerobic glycolysis. We quantitated their expression in glioma tissue of different grades in a large set of patient samples and were able to show that the expression of HP1-gamma, highly upregulated in glioblastoma stem-like cells, correlates to glioma grade. Independent analysis of publicly available glioma patient data showed that LDHA expression is linked to IDH1 mutation status both in high grade and low grade gliomas. The same analysis reinforced our findings towards an increased involvement of CBX3/HP1-gamma in high grade gliomas. Altogether, CBX3/HP1-gamma and LDHA are novel biomarkers for cancer stem cell phenotype with different clinical importance in gliomas.']",

We recently demonstrated that the regulatory RNA binding protein, HuR, binds to numerous metabolic mRNA transcripts and regulates their expression. Additionally, HuR silencing with small interfering RNAs(siRNAs) inhibited growth of PDA cells in vitro under glucose deprivation. Herein, we manipulated HuR expression levels in PDA cells and performed isotope tracer fate association studies to better understand HuR's role in metabolic reprogramming.Methods\", ' We used 13C-labeled nutrients to map carbon flux in BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells that were either transiently transfected with siRNA oligos against HuR (siHuR) or scrambled control (siCTRL). Cells were incubated with standard DMEM or mild glucose deprivation (5 mM glucose) for 48 hours, and media were supplemented with [1,2-13C2]-D-glucose or [U-13C5]-L-glutamine tracers for the final 24 hours. A total of 24 samples were snap frozen and prepared for GC-MS isotopomer analysis (3 replicates X 2 different siRNA oligos X 2 isotope tracers X 2 glucose concentrations).

Reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived isocitrate was impaired and futile carbon exchange fluxes were prevalent (not shown).Conclusions', ' HuR enhances metabolic efficiency in PDA cells by directly regulating multiple metabolic pathways.

        "Background":"['Background', '  Cancers of the appendix are rare forms of malignancy that include two major mucin producing tumors, mucinous adenocarcinoma (MA) and goblet cell carcinoid (GCC). There is no clear standard of care for management of these malignancies. We queried whether comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of MA and GCC would reveal differences in the pattern of genomic alterations (GA) of these two subtypes of appendiceal cancer and serve as a guide for targeted therapies for this disease.  Methods', '  DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from 20 clinically advanced appendiceal carcinomas (9 GCC and 11 MA).  Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a high mean coverage depth of  >600X for 3,230 exons of 182 cancer-related genes, plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. The results were evaluated for all classes of GA including base substitutions, short insertions and deletions, copy number alterations and fusions/rearrangements. Clinically relevant GAs were defined as GAs linked to drugs on the market or under evaluation in mechanism driven clinical trials.  Results', '  Base substitutions in KRAS were seen in 73% of MA and 11% of GCCs. TP53 mutations were seen in 64% of MA and 22% of GCCs. MYC (36%), SMAD4 (27%), and APC (27%) mutations were found in MA but were absent in GCC. Other GA of low frequency, but clinically relevant in both subsets included ERBB2, GNAS, ARID1A, PIK3CA, NRAS, CTNNB1, BRCA1, BRAF, KDR, PTEN, MCL1, IDH1, FBXW7, and RICTOR.  Conclusions', ' KRAS and TP53 mutations are common in appendiceal MA, but rare in appendiceal GCCs. This confirms the differences in biology and has implications regarding the use of targeted therapies such as anti-EGFR antibody treatments. The high frequency of clinically relevant genomic alterations uncovered in this study that can potentially serve as targets for therapies, either approved or in clinical trials, raises hope that CGP can lead to improvement in outcomes for patients with this aggressive form of malignancy.']",
