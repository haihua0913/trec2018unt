        "Background":"[\"Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the United States with the number of incidences persistently rising due to the depletion of the ozone layer and lack of adequate solar protection. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), composed of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), encompasses the vast majority of skin cancers with over 2 million new cases each year. Silibinin, an active bioflavanone was previously shown to have major protective effect against ultraviolet B radiation (UVB)-induced SCC through promoting DNA damage repair as well as inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis. To date, however, the efficacy of silibinin has not been tested against BCC, which alone accounts for about 80% of NMSC incidences. BCC mostly causes disfigurement, pain and morbidity, and warrants greater attention for its prevention and treatment. The hallmark of BCC has been the constitutive activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, mostly through the loss of function mutations in the patched (PTCH) gene. In the present study, we utilized ASZ001 cell line, derived from a mouse BCC tumor induced by UV-radiation in a PTCH1 heterozygous mouse, to evaluate the anti-cancer efficacy of silibinin against BCC. ASZ001 cells lack both copies of the PTCH1 gene and closely resembles the PTCH1 status in human BCC. We treated ASZ001 cells with either DMSO (control) or various doses of silibinin (25-100 M), and performed trypan blue exclusion, clonogenic, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution assays. Results showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) decreases the total cell number by 38-51% (p<0.001), 67-84% (p<0.001) and 40-95% (p<0.05-p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment. Clonogenic assay further confirmed the decrease in cell viability by silibinin, and we observed 18% (p<0.05), 92% (p<0.001) and 100% (p<0.001) decrease in colony formation with 25, 50 and 100 M doses of silibinin, respectively, in ASZ001 cells. Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) also increased the cell death by 2 folds (p<0.05), 3 folds (p<0.001), and 4 folds (p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment while annexin/PI staining confirmed that silibinin-induced cell death in ASZ001 cells is mainly apoptotic in nature. FACS analyses revealed that silibinin treatment significantly modulated the cell cycle distribution in ASZ001 cells, and we observed an S-phase arrest at 50 M silibinin dose and a G2M arrest at 100 M silibinin dose after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Molecular studies showed that silibinin treatment strongly decreases the expression of hedgehog signaling transcriptional factor Gli1, which is typically overexpressed in BCC and is known to regulate the expression of several oncogenes. Together, these results provide the first evidence of silibinin's efficacy against BCC cells, and suggest that silibinin could be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of both types of NMSCs.\"]",

There is currently no treatment for refractory, metastatic PTC, which results in 1500 deaths in the US each year. A challenge in identifying targeted therapies for Ret fusion driven cancers has been the lack of predictive models. We created transgenic, over-expression Drosophila models of PTC1 and PTC3, and found that they cause cancer phenotypes such as delamination, cell migration, and EMT. We conducted a genetic screen of the Drosophila kinome (252 alleles) and a drug screen of FDA approved cancer therapeutics (62 compounds) against flies expressing either PTC1 or PTC3. We found that PTC1 and PTC3, despite containing identical Ret kinase domains, have a different signaling output and are sensitive to different kinase inhibitors. Of the 19 kinases that were identified as hits from the PTC3 kinome screen, only 5 overlap with PTC1 hits. PTC3 is most sensitive to Ponatinib, where as PTC1 is most sensitive to Cabozantinib.

        "Background":"['Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common cancer among people of European ancestry. Aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) signaling plays a pivotal role in BCC carcinogenesis. Besides mutations in genes encoding HH pathway components, mutations in the p53 gene frequently are found in human BCCs. Consistently, our previous studies have found that the loss of p53 can dramatically accelerate BCC formation in ionizing radiation (IR)-treated Ptch1+/- mice. It remains elusive how p53 is activated in BCC development. DNA damage response (DDR) and oncogenic induced stress (OIS) are two essentially independent pathways leading to p53 activation although limited evidence suggests crosstalk between these pathways. In response to OIS, ARF is activated and leads to p53 activation, functioning as a tumor suppressor, in many cancers. However, the loss of ARF, unlike loss of p53, failed to affect the development of medulloblastoma in Ptch1+/- mice (Wetmore C., et al, 2001). In the present study, we investigated whether ARF affects BCC development in the same mice.To address this, we bred ARFGFP/GFP mice, in which ARF function is disabled and GFP is expressed under the control of the endogenous ARF promoter, with our Ptch1+/- mice to generate Ptch1+/- ARFGFP/GFP (designated as ARF mice) for comparison with Ptch1+/- K14CreER2 p53fl/fl (PF) mice. Following our standard protocol of tamoxifen injection at age 7.5 weeks to delete p53 specifically in K14-expressing keratinocytes (for PF mice) and treating both ARF and PF mice with ionizing radiation at age 8 weeks, we compared BCC development between the above 2 lines.We find that at age 5 months, ARF mice formed numbers of microscopic BCCs comparable to those in PF mice though the latter exhibited greater mouse-to-mouse variation. More importantly, both mouse lines developed initial visible BCCs at age 5 to 7 months, which is dramatically earlier than the age 9 to 18 months for the Ptch1+/- mice (ARF+/+ and p53+/+). In addition, ARFGFP/GFP mice responded to IR-induced DNA damage in a pattern essentially similar to ARF+/+ mice, indicating an intact DDR pathway as reported in the literature.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ARF is involved in BCC carcinogenesis as a tumor suppressor, probably playing the major, perhaps the exclusive, role in activating p53 in this process.']",

Results', ' NSCLC SMOP641A in vitro activated the hedgehog pathway, and vismodegib/cyclopamine inhibited tumor cell growth.

In the NSCLC TCGA databases, somatic SMO mutations occur 1.7%. In the overall TCGA database, germline SMO P641A occurred in 0.11% of cancer patients (multiple cancers) compared with 0% in cancer-free individuals. Patient A (never-smoking SCC) had a 46% RECIST reduction within 6 weeks for 6 months on vismodegib.

Two additional NSCLC patients (B  germline P641A and C M525L received vismodegib; B initially stabilized but stopped vismodegib after 14 weeks for toxicity while patient C had no response. Conclusions', 'SMO mutations are targetable, potentially heritable, oncogenic drivers in NSCLC and other cancers.

There is practically no overlap between RET/PTC, RAS and BRAF mutations in PTC, the lack of concordance for these mutations provides compelling genetic evidence for the requirement of this signaling system for transformation to PTC. However, the effect of these genetic alterations in other signaling pathways remains unclear, which could, at least in part, cooperates in transformation. Recently, Notch signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis in other cancer types. In this study, we test the hypothesis that RET/PTC and BRAFT1799A oncogenes crosstalks and regulates Notch pathway. Methods', ' TPC-1 and BCPAP (human PTC cells harboring RET/PTC1 rearrangement and BRAFT1799A mutation, respectively) were treated with gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) and proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay and growth curve; cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. PCCL3 cells harboring Doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3 and BRAFT1799A (PC-BRAF) were used to analyze protein and gene expression by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Notch1 protein expression was analyzed in transgenic mice (Tg-BRAF) which harbor targeted expression of BRAFT1799A restricted to thyroid gland. Results', ' PTC cells treated with GSI decreased the percentage of viable cell in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the growth rate. Cell cycle analysis in PTC cells showed enhancement of DNA fragmentation and increased apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the GSI treatment in PTC cells modulates cell cycle related genes, increasing CDKN1A and CDKN1B gene expression and reducing CCND1, MCM6, CKS2, and MADL2 expression. Conditional activation of RET/PTC3 and BRAFT1799A in PTC3-5 and PC-BRAF cells, respectively, showed a sustained enhancement in pERK protein expression, increased Notch1 protein and gene expression and Hes1 gene expression, the target gene of Notch signaling. Furthermore, transgenic mice Tg-BRAF showed a stronger stain for Notch1 in follicular and stromal cells. Treating PTC cells with MEK inhibitors, U0126 or PD96059, reduces NOTCH1 and HES1 gene expression. The combination of GSI with MEK inhibitor enhances the growth suppression promote by MAPK signaling inhibition in PTC cell proliferation.

        "Background":"['The Hedgehog(Hh) signaling pathway is activated in most hematological and solid cancers and is a promising target for therapeutic development. Deletions in the receptor Patched (PTCH) or activating mutations in the upstream positive regulator Smoothened(SMO) have been reported in a few cancers such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but are largely absent in most tumor types; therefore, the mechanism of pathway activation in most cancers remains unknown. In normal tissues, Hh pathway activation via PTCH/SMO causes an increase in the downstream activating transcription factor GLI1 and a decrease in the transcriptional repressor GLI3R. We confirm that the Hh pathway is active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is required for cell survival, however, this activity is largely independent of the upstream activator SMO. Using siRNA knock down of GLI1, GLI3 and SMO in AML cell lines, Gli3 conditional knock out mice, and primary AML samples, we are able to show that loss of the GLI3R repressor function is sufficient to activate Hh target gene expression independent of ligand binding, and GLI3R levels correlate inversely with GLI1 levels. Importantly, we show that GLI3R is required for the therapeutic effect of SMO antagonists in AML samples and restoration of GLI3R restores sensitivity to SMO antagonists in AML cell lines. Epigenetic and gene expression analysis of the TCGA AML data set reveals that the GLI3 expression is silenced in most AML patient samples. We demonstrate in vitro and in patients that treatment with hypomethylating agents restores GLI3R levels and sensitivity to SMO antagonists in AML. In a transgenic mouse model of myeloproliferative disease (vav-Jak2V617F, gift of Joe Zhao, OUHSC) effective treatment with SMO antagonists are associated with increases in GLI3R but no changes in GLI1. Finally we show that GLI3R can directly repress expression of AKT and in vivo responses to SMO antagonists are correlated with changes in AKT expression, independent of GLI1 levels. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that GLI3R plays an essential role in SMO independent Hh signaling in AML, and suggests that GLI3R could serve as a potential biomarker for patient selection in SMO antagonist clinical trials. Furthermore, these data provide important mechanistic data to support rational combinations of hypomethylating agents with SMO antagonists in clinical trials.']",

The analysis of 99 tumor samples obtained from 33 PTC cases revealed that TERTp mutations were quite common (42.4%).The mutation C228T was much more common than the C250T (78,6% vs 21,4%). TERTp mutations did not correlate with specific PTC subtypes [CL-PTC, FV-PTC or Mixed-PTC] and were subclonal in half of the cases. The mutations segregated to LNMs in 73% of cases [100% CL-PTC and FV-PTC; 57% Mixed PTC]. In 2 Mixed-PTC cases the mutation seemingly originated the novo in the LNM. TERTp mutations were present in all samples of DM. While 71% of the cases mutated at TERTp bore the BRAFV600E mutation, the coexistence of TERTp and RAS mutations was exceptional. TERTp mutations were found to be significantly correlated with age ≥ 45 years old, high grade poorly differentiated PTC foci or nesting-PDC-like foci, stage at diagnosis or at last follow-up and patient status. A trend of correlation with male sex, vascular invasion, tumor recurrence and development of LNM during the follow-up was also seen. Tumor multifocality was inversely correlated with TERTp mutations. The coexistence of TERTp and BRAFV600E mutants did not increase the prognostic power of TERTp mutations alone. All of the patients who died of disease displayed TERTp mutations. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with PTC bearing TERTp mutations had a poor prognosis showing a higher tumor recurrence probability [p= 0.0085] and a reduced disease specific survival [p<0.0001]. The coexistence of other mutations did not significantly increase the risk of recurrence or dying of disease.

Despite current chemotherapy with concomitant surgical resection and radiotherapy, GBM 5-year survival is 3%. A better understanding of the cellular pathways in tumor proliferation and survival is required for the development of new treatments. Previously, the Sonic Hedgehog pathway has been shown to be dysregulated in chemoresistant GBM. Pharmacological inhibition of SHH signaling with Cyclopamine enhanced GBM chemosensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ). SHH receptor, PTCH1, is tonically repressed by the ligandbut is activated by by receptor-mediated endocytosis of SHH. Here we show SHH signaling in GBM is ligand-independent and is initiated by post-transcriptional regulation of PTCH1. MicroRNA are small non-coding RNA molecules known to regulate a number of cell processes such as development and oncogenesis. As far as we are aware there is no report on microRNA in the regulation of PTCH1. Knockdown of Dicer, a Type III RNAase, which is required for microRNA synthesis, increased the cellular toxicity to TMZ, thus revealing the importance of microRNA in GBM chemoresistance. We have indentified and characterized PTCH as a functional target of microRNA-9 (miR-9) in both non-neural cell lines as well as GBM cell lines. Overexpression of miR-9 in GBM cells results in downstream pathway activation and resistance to TMZ treatment. We also explored a number of mir-9/PTCH1-dependent mechanisms of chemoresistance and uncovered downstream upregulation of ATP-binding cassette drug efflux transporters, MDR1 and ABCG2. Taken together, our data indicate a role for miRNA9 in the acquisition of chemoresistance in GBMs and may serve as novel therapeutic targets.']",

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and it accounts for the largest fraction of endocrine cancer-related deaths. The accurate classification of well-differentiated thyroid tumors remains a significant challenge that impacts prognosis and therapeutic choices for patients. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) are the most common and the best characterized types of thyroid cancer, being diagnosed in approximately 80% and 15% of patients, respectively. Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is, after classical PTC, the most commonly diagnosed subtype of PTC, accounting for 9% to 22% of PTC cases. FVPTC exhibits some nuclear features of PTC but has a follicular growth pattern. Diagnosis of FVPTC presents a great challenge to pathologists, as these tumors can have distinct prognoses with variable clinical implications. While the incidence/diagnosis of FVPTC is growing in the U.S., the genetic characteristics of the disease remain poorly understood, and there is a need for complementary molecular assays that can help discriminate between the more benign forms of FVPTC and those that will exhibit an aggressive clinical course.In this study, we performed molecular analysis of 101 FVPTC archival surgical specimens using the SNaPshot multiplexed targeted sequencing platform, to interrogate 90 genetic loci frequently mutated in 21 cancer genes, including the BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and CTNNB1 (-catenin) oncogenes commonly altered in thyroid cancer. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of cDNA obtained from the same tumors was used to test for the presence of RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 gene rearrangements found in PTC, and for PAX8-PPAR gene fusions characteristic of FTC.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' An important translational application of preclinical models is the ability to draw insights into the etiology and molecular pathways altered in cancers. This is especially true for brain tumors since the early stages of disease are rarely detectable in patients and advanced-stage tumors may not accurately reflect the mutations responsible for tumor initiation. Therefore, there is a critical need for sensitive imaging protocols that allow the study of the early stages of tumor formation. In this study we optimized an in vivo high-resolution contrast-enhanced MRI protocol for the early detection and characterization of a novel mouse model of medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor which originates in the cerebellum (Cb).Method', ' The Patched (Ptc1) mutant mouse is one of the most studied models of MB. In our study we generated a new variant of this model (referred as Ptc1-CKO) by breeding Ptf1acre/+ mice with mice homozygous for a floxed allele of the Ptc1 gene (Ptc1fl/fl). Using this approach, Ptc1 was deleted in less than 1,000 embryonic Ptf1a-expressing granule cell progenitors (GCPs) compared to the extensive mutation of many GCPs seen in many models. Based on our results, tumors in Ptc1-CKO mice likely initiate from a single mutated GCP, and thus better models the clonal origin of sporadic human MBs. Thus, the Ptc1-CKO mouse is an ideal platform to study the early stages of MB tumorigenesis. For in vivo imaging, we used manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to obtain images 24h after intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a manganese chloride (MnCl2) solution using a 7T micro-MRI system. We acquired three-dimensional (3D) images with a 15-minute and 2-hour protocol for screening and high-resolution images, respectively. Image analysis was performed using AMIRA software. After imaging, tumors were extracted for histological and molecular analysis.Results', ' The contrast obtained with our MEMRI protocol showed detailed cerebellar morphology and allowed detection of MBs in Ptc1-CKO mice at different stages. Our in vivo MRI protocol was sensitive enough to detect pre-neoplastic lesions as early as 2 weeks postnatal age (N=22) and was validated with histology (N=12). Furthermore, in vivo longitudinal micro-MRI allowed the noninvasive monitoring of individual pre-neoplastic lesions and showed that individual lesions have different tumorigenic potential. Volumetric studies were performed to analyze tumor morphology and growth rates (N=25), and the advanced phenotypes were correlated with immunohistochemistry. In addition, 3D MRI images were used to guide the dissection of tumor tissue for microarray expression analysis (N=6). Our results show that Shh-driven MBs in Ptc1-CKO mice display at least two distinct imaging and molecular phenotypes, contrary to previous reports that all Shh-driven tumors converge to a common molecular endpoint.']",

        "Background":"['The stem cell-associated transcription co-factor ZNF521 has been implicated in the control of haematopoietic, osteogenic and neural progenitors. Very high expression of this factor is present in cerebellum and particularly in the granule layer of neonatal cerebellum, that contains candidate cells-of-origin of medulloblastoma. Here we have explored the possible involvement of ZNF521 in the development of this tumour.As an experimental system we used the human medulloblastoma cell line, DAOY, and primary cells from medulloblastomas occurring in Ptc1-/+ mice. To investigate the effect of ZNF521 on the growth and tumourigenic potential of these cells, its expression was modulated using lentiviral vectors carrying the ZNF521 cDNA, or containing shRNAs that silence its expression.Enforced overexpression of ZNF521 in DAOY cells, that normally produce relatively low amounts of this protein, was associated with a significant increase in their proliferation rate. This was mirrored by an increase in the ability to grow as spheroids and clonogenicity in single-cell cultures and in semisolid media, and accompanied by an enhanced migratory capacity in wound-healing assays. Finally, ZNF521-expressing DAOY cells demonstrated a greatly enhanced tumourigenic potential in nude mice. All these activities required the presence of an N-terminal domain of ZNF521 that recruits the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Consistently with the effects of ZNF521 overexpression in DAOY, silencing of Zfp521 in Ptc1-/+ medulloblastoma cells resulted in a drastic decrease in their proliferation and tumourigenic potential, lending further support to the notion that zinc finger protein 521 may contribute to the generation and/or maintenance of the cancer-initiating cell compartment in this cancer. Preliminary experiments detected a selective up-regulation of HES5 mRNA in DAOY overexpressing ZNF521, raising the possibility that some of the effects illustrated here may at least in part be mediated by the co-operation of ZNF521 with the Notch pathway.Citation Format', ' Raffaella Spina, Gessica Filocamo, Enrico Iaccino, Stefania Scicchitano, Michela Lupia, Emanuela Chiarella, Tiziana Mega, Daniela Pelaggi, Maria Mesuraca, Eli E.

        "Background":"['Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a heparin binding growth factor known to have role in neuronal development. It is highly expressed in embryo but has a very limited expression in adult tissues. PTN is considered a proto-oncogene and has been hypothesized to play role in oncogenesis as its expression is found to be increased in many different cancer subtypes. Its role in cell transformation, cell growth, survival, migration and angiogenesis has also been shown in various different types of cancers. The function of PTN is hypothesized to be carried out by its interaction with cell surface proteoglycans or binding to its selective cell surface receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor Z1 (PTPRZ1). The significance of role of PTN in pathogenesis of thyroid cancer has not been explored especially with the fact that papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) originating in this ethnic population is the second most common female malignancy, after breast. So in search for novel druggable molecular target we sought for PTN expression in a large cohort of Saudi PTC. We analysed PTN alteration in more than 1000 primary papillary thyroid carcinoma in a tissue microarray format with clinical follow up data. We found that PTN was overexpressed in 65.5% (658/1006) of PTC and was significantly associated with aggressive clinical parameters such as tall cell variant histological subtype (p = 0.0333), extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.0292), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.0182) and large tumour size (p = 0.0160). Important significant molecular association was seen with PTPRZ-1 (p = 0.0316), Midkine (p = 0.0008) and pSTAT-3 (p<0.0001). Finally patients showing PTN overexpression have worse disease free survival compared to patients showing low or absent PTN expression (p = 0.0218). On multivariate analysis PTN is found to be an independent marker of poor prognosis taking into consideration parameters such as Age, Stage, Lymph node status and Extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.0430). This study highlights the importance of PTN as druggable molecular target which can be therapeutically exploited by its inhibitors in treatment of PTC.Keywords', ' Papillary Thyroid Cancer; Pleiotrophin; Pleiotrophin Receptor']",

Our previous study of PTCs from a Ukrainian cohort who were < 18 y.o. at the time of Chernobyl and received 0.008-8.6 Gy of I-131 to the thyroid revealed that RET/PTC rearrangement was the most common mutation and correlated with I-131 dose (Cancer, in press).

The aim of this study was to examine the remaining tumors for rare rearrangements known to occur in thyroid cancer and for novel chromosomal rearrangements.Design', ' Twenty-five mutation-negative PTCs were analyzed. RT-PCR was used to search for BRAF/AKAP9 fusion and differential real-time PCR to search for all types of RET and NTRK1 rearrangements.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Tumor metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many pathways and biomarkers have been studied to clarify the mechanism of disease progression, but the exact mechanism of metastasis remains poorly understood. Based on previous studies, the hedgehog signaling pathway is involved in tumor growth and differentiation. However, little is known about the associations of expression of components of the hedgehog pathway and metastatic progression in NSCLC. Here we examined the differential expression of sonic hedgehhog (Shh) and its receptor patched (ptc) for its involvement in metastatic progression. Methods', ' Immunohistochemical staining for Shh, and ptc was performed on 115 primary NSCLC (adenocarcinoma [n = 65] and nonadenocarcinoma [n = 50]) and 55 matching metastatic lymph nodes. All patients were treated by complete anatomic resections and were limited to T1-2N1-2M0. Scoring was accomplished by evaluating stain intensity and frequency of expression by tumor cells, with 25 random fields surveyed per section. A score was then calculated based on these parameters for statistical comparisons. Parameters that were compared include differential primary and lymph nodes staining, tumor histopathological subtype, and disease-free and overall survival. All statistical comparisons were performed in SPSS v15.0 and consisted of either Mann-Whitney rank sums test (two-sided) or Kaplan-Meier curves. Results', ' There was no significant difference in the pattern of shh and ptc staining in primary tumor versus local lymph node metastases. (p = 0.2 and 0.5, respectively). Shh and ptc were expressed in adenocarcinoma at a significantly higher level and more frequently than compared to non adenocarcinoma samples (p = 0.001 and 0.01 respectively). Disease-free survival was higher in shh negative tumor samples compared to the positive group (p = 0.03), and shh positivity correlated with higher rate of recurrence. (p = 0.03).

While the greatest incidence of PTC is in women of childbearing age, the occurrence of PTC in men and postmenopausal women is associated with increased aggressiveness and poorer clinical outcomes. This gender disparity suggests that while the initiation of PTC is driven by estrogens, its progression may be mediated by androgens. Immunohistochemical analysis of PTC specimens from 5 male and 15 female patients indicated that all expressed androgen receptors (AR). AR mRNA was detected in equivalent amounts in three thyroid cell lines, but the PTC cell lines, BCPAP and TPC-1 expressed significantly more AR protein (4.6 fold and 3.9 fold, respectively) than the normal T-antigen transformed thyrocyte cell line, Nthy-ori-1. The treatment of the cell lines with the synthetic androgen, R1881 (10nM) resulted in increased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in all three cell lines. Nthy expressed 2 fold more pERK when treated with R1881 whereas pAKT, which was previously undetected increased to significantly higher levels. R1881 addition increased pERK and pAKT 3 fold and 2 fold, respectively, in the male, RET/PTC cell line, TPC-1. pERK and pAKT were undetectable in the female, BRAFV600E cell line and were significantly induced by R1881.The known role of ERK and AKT in cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, and the activation of these molecules by androgens, may provide the mechanistic basis for the gender disparity in PTC aggressiveness and clinical outcome between young women and men/postmenopausal women.']",

Routine surveillance by serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and medical imaging is the current practice to monitor disease progression of the patients. However, the presence of anti-Tg antibody or other influence factors may discount the value of serum Tg in disease monitoring. Whether enumeration of circulating epithelial cells (CECs) and its combined analyses with serum Tg help to define disease status of PTC patients was investigated. CECs were first enriched from the peripheral blood of the healthy control subjects (G1, n = 17) and the patients at disease-free status (G2, n = 26) or with distant metastasis (G3, n = 22). The number of CECs expressing epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy analyses. The medium number of EpCAM+-CECs was 6 (intequartile range 1-11), 12 (interquartile range 7-16) and 91 (interquartile range 31-206) cells/ml of blood for G1, G2 and G3, respectively. EpCAM+-CEC counts were significantly higher in G3 than in G1 (p<0.05) and G2 (p<0.05). Our data further revealed that combined analysis of serum Tg with EpCAM+-CEC defined the disease status (disease-free vs. distant metastasis) in 46 (95.8%) of the 48 patients with the AUC equivalent of 0.962 (p<0.0001) in the ROC analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay was 100% and 92.3%, respectively. Moreover, all 22 patients (100%) with metastatic status were defined accordingly.

        "Background":"['Rearranged in transformation/ papillary thyroid carcinoma 3 (RET/PTC3 or RP3), is a unique fusion oncogene, responsible for a benign version of PTC. RP3 has an active inflammatory component leading to the secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, however the role of inflammation in development and progression of PTC has not been clearly defined. Facilitating investigation of this issue is our finding that the transforming and inflammatory signals of RP3 can be functionally separated allowing us to study each in isolation. We generated several RP3 mutants ablated in; 1) transformative signaling due to mutation of a tyrosine residue (RP3Y588Fmutant) which prevents the binding of downstream adaptor proteins 2) inflammatory signaling through mutation of binding sites for TRAF2 and TRAF6. Transformation only RP3 mutants grew tumors in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, strengthening our hypothesis that the inflammatory component of RP3 is responsible for the benign nature of PTC.To assess the impact of inflammatory RP3 on the progression of different tumors, various thyroid and non-thyroid tumorigenic cell lines were transduced with MSCV_IRES_GFP_RP3 mutants and sorted for GFP expression. With highly immunogenic MC57G cells (C57BL/6 mice), the transforming only mutants developed tumors whereas wild type RP3 along with inflammatory only RP3 were rejected. Inflammation only RP3 mutant also led to slower tumor growth in Renca cell line (Balb/c) demonstrating the effect to be independent of haplotype. We are currently extending the analysis to PTC lines with BRAF and KRAS mutations, which are usually associated with more aggressive tumor profiles without an inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Our data so far suggest that contrary to the contemporary view, inflammation can retard tumor progression. Thus, the RP3 oncogene might be exploited in this regard. Future experiments aim to further characterize the importance of RP3-driven inflammation in tumor growth through continued in vivo and in vitro studies.']",

Peritoneal lavage cytology (CY) is used widely in the diagnosis and staging of gastric and pancreatic cancer. Positive CY findings (CY+) in PC is defined as stage IV disease, however, the true value of CY+ for the patient’s prognosis remains controversial. We rise the question of whether CY+ status has predictive value for survival and early intraperitoneal recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate use of a new genetically modified telomerase-specific replication-selective adenovirus, expressing GFP (TelomeScan F35) in rapid detection of viable peritoneal tumor cell (v-PTC) dissemination of PC. This human clinical trial sought to determine if the presence of virally-detected, rare v-PTC predict peritoneal recurrence and patient outcome. This study was approved by the Osaka Police Hospital IRB. Patients with resectable cytologically or histologically proven ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were enrolled. Peritoneal lavage fluid was harvested just after a laparotomy in 27 patients with PC. Half of the fluid was examined by cytology with papanicolau staining and MOC-31 immunostaining and the remaining half was used to detect v-PTC with TelomeScan F35. To distinguish between leucocyte and cells with epithelial origin, cells were stained with anti-CD45 Ab. To further distinguish cells with primary tumor origin, cells were labeled with anti-CEA and anti-CA19-9 Abs. GFP-positive and CD45-negative, and either CEA- or CA19-9-positive cells were counted as v-PTC. Patients were followed after surgery to evaluate its clinical significance. Among 27 patients aged 57-91 years (16 males and 11 females), 3 were cytologically positive (CY+), other 3 were virally positive by TelomeScan F35 (v-PTC+).

Early clinical trials using inhibitors to this mutant protein or its substrates, the MEK1/2 kinases, prolonged progression-free survival or stabilized disease in patients with advanced PTC. However, the toxicities of these inhibitors are uniquely highlighted in an indolent disease like PTC, which would require patients to endure toxicities long-term. Our goal was to determine if tetrathimoybdate (TM), a well-tolerated copper chelator we have previously shown to inhibit BRAF-mutated melanoma via MEK inhibition, can inhibit BRAF-driven PTC growth. Methods', ' We assessed TM in comparison to current standard of care (SOC), Lenvatinib and Sorafenib, and mutant BRAF inhibitor, Vemurafenib. Anchorage independent growth assays were used to test the inhibitory effect of these drugs on human BRAF-mutated PTC cell lines. We then confirmed these findings by treating a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of aggressive BRAF-driven PTC. Results', ' TM inhibited 57.5% of colony growth in vitro, which was not significantly different from the 42.4% and 32.2% inhibition by Sorafenib and Lenvatinib, respectively. TM inhibition was less effective than the 70.3% inhibition by Vemurafenib (p =0.04). We confirmed these results in vivo, where mice on the TM arm, on average, were observed to have 14.8% of their thyroid glands occupied by tumor, a statistically significant reduction from the mice in the control arm, whose tumor load averaged 23.6% (p= 0.008). This 37.4% reduction in tumor burden was not statistically different from the 35.2% reduction measured in the Vemurafenib arm, where mice on average had 15.3% of their thyroid glands replaced by tumor. Conclusions', ' The copper chelator, TM, was as effective as the SOCs, Lenvatinib and Sorafenib, at inhibiting the growth of human PTC in vitro. Although TM was slightly less effective than Vemurafenib in vitro, TM was as effective as Vemurafenib at reducing tumor load in a GEMM of BRAF-driven PTC. Success of TTM in these PTC models may next inform a Phase I trial assessing TM in patients with advanced PTC.']",

To examine the prevalence of these alterations in metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid carcinoma, we initiated genomic profiling on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded clinical tumor specimens. We report on the first seven completed.  Methods', '  A clinical next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligationbased libraries to high, uniform coverage for 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer.   Results', '  All but one of the patients with PTC had extensive pulmonary metastases and RAI-refractory disease.

        "Background":"['Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC) accounts for the vast majority of thyroid cancers and comprises more than 90% of neoplasms in the endocrine system. In the last 30 years, the incidence and prevalence of PTC has dramatically risen in developed countries, with a three-fold higher incidence in women than in men. With an overall five-year survival rate of 98.1%, early stage PTC has a favorable prognosis. However, PTC exhibits increased aggressiveness with poor prognosis in men diagnosed with the disease. These striking observations led us to explore the role of androgen and androgen receptor (AR) in this disease. We found an approximately 70% decrease in median AR RNA expression (p<0.0001) in 24 PTC patient tissue samples (from New York Eye and Ear Infirmary), compared to matched, normal thyroid tissue. A similar trend was also observed in about 500 PTC samples in the TCGA database, compared with 60 normal thyroid samples. Methylation was explored as a cause for the down-regulation of the AR mRNA in disease pathogenesis, using in-silico methods such as Wanderer, a Maplab tool for TCGA RNA data visualization, and MethylPlotter. A methylation pattern of the AR gene, spanning 7 exons, was generated with 30 methylation sites and, AR in PTC was found to be predominantly methylated at ten sites, compared to matched normal thyroid tissue samples, in the TCGA. Patients with ten or more hypermethylated sites on the AR gene in tumor tissue exhibited a significant decrease in the AR RNA expression in the tumor, versus matched normal thyroid tissue. Methylation of AR (10 or more sites) was accompanied by a nine-fold reduction in AR expression in male PTC, and a five-fold decrease in female PTC. This reduction was not observed in hyper- or equally-methylated normal thyroid tissue. We selected eleven methylation sites in the CpG islands that we predict are essential for AR silencing, with four sites in the AR promoter region. Additionally, we found AR gene-specific and global transcription activators to be downregulated, and repressors up-regulated in the PTC samples. The data adds importance to our previous studies showing induction of senescence in AR-transfected PTC cells in culture, when AR is stimulated with 5α-dihydrotestosterone. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a fine regulation and differential expression of AR associated with methylation, and highlights the significance of epigenetic modifications in thyroid cancer progression.']",

Recent studies demonstrated that the BIR3 domain of XIAP where caspase-9 and Smac proteins bind is an attractive site for designing small-molecule inhibitors of XIAP. Embelin, identified primarily from the Embelia ribes plant, is one such compound shown to exhibit chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, and apoptotic activities via inhibiting XIAP activity. In this study we found tthat embelin generated a dose dependent Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PTC cell lines. Pretreatment of PTC cell with N-acetyl-Lcysteine, an scavenger of ROS prevented embelin mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Further more, NAC pretreatment also abrogated embeling mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. In addition treatment of PTC cell lines with embelin causes activation of p38, a stress related map kinases leading to up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5). Interestingly NAC pretreatment prevented its activation as well as up-regulation of DR5. Altogether, these data suggest a novel function for embelin causes inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis via generation of ROS a suppressor of XIAP pathway via generation of ROS in PTC cells, and raise the possibility that this agent may have a future therapeutic role in PTC and possibly other malignancies with up-regulated XIAP pathway.']",

The pro-apoptotic family members include proteins that only contain the BH-3 domain and include Bax, Bak, Bid, PUMA, NOXA, Bim and Bad while the anti-apoptotic proteins include members such as Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl and Mcl-1. In normal conditions, there is a balance between the pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Because of their important role in cell survival, there has been lot of interest in utilizing dysregulation of Bcl-2 family members to counter cancer growth and induce apoptosis. Bcl-Xl is an anti-apoptotic protein that has found to be over-expressed in various cancers including lung cancer, DLBCL and breast cancer.

As a whole, Shh inhibition conferred a less in vitro tumorigenic status to Daoy cells. Moreover, we assessed the expression of different Gli1 target genes and other genes, before and after Shh inhibition, and found that Shh shows a crosstalk with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that have been described in numerous tumors.

        "Background":"['The incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States has significantly increased over the past decade, with over 60,220 cases predicted for 2013. While premenopausal women have an approximately four fold higher incidence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) than men, once diagnosed, PTC in men exhibits increased aggressiveness and results in poorer clinical outcomes. These paradoxical observations led us to investigate the role that androgens and/or androgen receptors play in PTC. Analysis of AR expression in 24 PTC patient tissue samples indicated a 5.97 fold reduction in AR expression compared to matched, normal tissue (P<0.0001). To more fully investigate the function of androgen/AR in thyroid cells in a more controlled experimental system, the AR cDNA (pSG5-AR) was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1+ expression vector and stably transfected into 8505C anaplastic/PTC cells. Addition of DHT to the 8505C-transfected clone, 84E7, resulted in AR translocation into the nucleus and a 48% reduction in proliferation (p=0.01) at 72 hours, as well as a shift in the cell cycle toward G1 arrest during the same time period. Transcription profiling using RNA-Seq and gene ontology analysis revealed significant changes in the process of cell proliferation (p=2.47e-24) possibly due to significant changes in CDK1A/p21 (up 3.42 fold), RhoB (up 50 fold), Jun (down 1.7 fold), SCF (down 3.31 fold) and NFKBIA (up 2.36). Additionally, expression levels of other cell cycle proteins, including CDK6 and multiple MCMs were also significantly reduced when AR was activated by DHT. FKBP5, the immunophilin which negatively regulates proliferation and is thought to play various roles in the neoplastic process, was up-regulated by androgen 8 fold and 4 fold on the mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Collectively, these data provide a molecular basis for the decreased proliferation noted. Further, these data suggest that the expression of androgen/AR in thyroid cells plays a protective, anti-proliferative role in normal thyroid tissue that is lost in neoplastic transformation resulting in dysregulation of cell cycle genes normally under negative AR control. The expression levels of AR, as well as available androgens, may play a role in the etiology of PTC, the differential incidence of the disease, as well as the different clinical presentations and outcomes between women and men.']",

        "Background":"['Distant metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is a multistep and complex process that frequently complicates the disease with poor prognosis. The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood has been reported in several cancer types to be highly related to the development of distant metastasis. Nevertheless, the CTCs status during the progression of PTC is rarely investigated. This study aimed to define and compare the CTCs counts among the healthy control individuals (Group I, n = 14), the PTC patients in disease-free status (Group II, n = 9), and the patients with distant metastasis (Group III, n = 8). The patients in group III had metastases to the lung and mediastinum (n = 4), bones (n = 3), and lung and kidney (n = 1), respectively. CTCs were enriched from the peripheral blood by the negative selection method PowerMag that has been validated in our previous study. CTCs enumeration was performed by immunofluorescence staining using the anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies. The EpCAM+ and TSHR+ CTCs counts were 2.97  2.03 and 9.97  9.22 cells/mL for group I, 10.43  9.03 and 19.17  9.77 cells/mL for group II, and 100.06  73.34 and 141.60  82.08 cells/mL for group III individuals, respectively (p < 0.01). These data indicate that (1) some of the TSHR+-CTCs are not EpCAM+ and this type of cell population can be overlooked if CTCs were enriched by the method based on positive selection of EpCAM+ cells; (2) the PTC patients in disease-free status has higher CTCs counts than the healthy control individuals and, hence, continuous CTCs enumeration is recommended for the patient in the stage of disease-free; (3) the PTC patients with distant metastases have higher CTCs counts when compares to the healthy control subjects and the patients with disease-free status. In conclusion, CTCs enumeration is thereby warranted in the course of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Combination therapy, with rare exception, is a requirement for successfully treating cancer patients. Advances in genetic characterization coupled with a growing understanding of tumor heterogeneity are poised to revolutionize future strategies for combination treatments. Historically, working out the best combinations has been challenging and largely through iterative cycles of clinical trial and error due to gross limitations of preclinical models to accurately predict activity. Current strategies for developing new anticancer drugs rely heavily on preclinical testing in cancer cell lines and their derived in vivo xenograft models. These models are fraught with significant limitations including highly passaged cancer cell lines grown on plastic that ignores the microenvironment and tempered representation of the complex heterogeneity of cancer. Tumor cell microenvironment has significant impact on growth kinetics, cell signaling and response to drug treatments. 3D models attempt to recapitulate elements of the microenvironment, are more biologically relevant models compared to 2D models and have gained preference among cancer researchers and drug developers. The purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of molecularly characterized patient derived lung tumor cells (PTCs) for steering decisions for effective combination treatments in the clinical setting. We have established preclinical lung cancer models using PTCs grown in a 3D culture system. Here we present a retrospective study in lung PTCs evaluating single agents and combinations of molecularly targeted as well as cytotoxic agents including erlotinib, crizotinib, etoposide, cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan and irinotecan. We utilized a range of methods (PCR, FISH, IF, WB) to determine the genetic and molecular features of the PTCs prior to performing drug treatments. We used high content imaging to evaluate subpopulations within PTCs, colony morphology and proliferative endpoints. Our results identified responder and non-responder populations and emphasize the need to base combination treatment strategies on subpopulation analysis of the tumor. Patient-derived tumor cell models grown in 3D culture conditions coupled with molecular characterization are essential for conducting hypothesis driven studies. This approach offers an informed starting point for subsequent in vivo studies from which data can guide personalized medicine decisions toward true translation in the clinic.']",

Cell line models fail to recapitulate the heterogeneous nature of tumor.

We have developed preclinical cancer models using PTCs grown in 3D cultures that better mimic in vivo conditions. One of the disadvantages of using patient derived cells is the limited number of cells available from biopsy samples. We utilized patient-derived xenografts (PDX) as a strategy to expand the human tumor cells in mice, while taking efforts to retain the actual tumor biology of the patient. We used high content imaging to evaluate colony segmentation, morphological features, proliferative and apoptotic endpoints to determine efficacy of oncology drug candidates. We conducted a retrospective study using PTCs from solid tumor indications including endometrial and lung to evaluate the correlation between various models and usefulness in predicting the outcome of a specific drug candidate. Our results indicate that PDX models in combination with 3D PTC models have predictive value and enable secondary interrogation beyond single agent anti-proliferative activity to better profile the antitumor activity of targeted agents.

        "Background":"['The ARID5B gene encodes a member of ARID transcription factors containing a unique DNA binding domain, ARID, which binds to AT-rich regions. Recently, point mutations of ARID5B, including nonsense, missense, and frame-shift mutations, were found in endometrial cancers. This finding strongly suggests that the ARID5B gene is a novel tumor suppressor candidate gene in this disease. However, detailed functions of wild-type/mutated ARID5B have not been examined. To explore the importance of ARID5B in development of endometrial cancer, the property of ARID5B was characterized. Interestingly, half of the point mutations reported previously were nonsense/ frame-shift mutations, generating premature termination codons (PTCs). Generally, genes with PTCs generate unstable mRNA, which are detected and degraded by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) unless the PTCs are located in the last exon or within 50 nucleotide from the last exon-intron boundary. Surprisingly, all the PTCs found in endometrial cancer are located in the last exon or within 50 nucleotide upstream of the last exon-intron of the ARID5B gene, suggesting that these mutated mRNA are stable to generate truncated ARID5B proteins. We also found that the wild-type ARID5B protein has PEST sequences, which make proteins unstable through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In virtue of the PTCs, the truncated ARID5B proteins lack these PEST sequences, but still have the ARID domain. Our study showed that the truncated ARID5B protein had longer half-life than that of wild-type ARID5B. Furthermore, we showed that the C-terminus of ARID5B had a repressive property, which was confirmed by a reporter gene assay with transient transfection. The C-terminus was deleted in the truncated ARID5B. The data suggest that the wild-type ARID5B could suppress the expression of down-stream target genes, but the truncated ARID5B could not. Taken together, the truncated ARID5B may accumulate in cells due to its longer half-life and inhibit repressive function of the wild-type ARID5B in a dominant-negative fashion. We also performed colony formation assays using an endometrial cancer cell line, Ishikawa. Expression of wild-type ARID5B was strongly suppressed in colonies resistant to G418, comparing with expression of GFP transfected into the cells as a control. In summary, we found that the truncated ARID5B is a long half-life protein without its transcriptional property, which may inhibit the transcriptional property of wild-type ARID5B. Our data suggest that ARID5B plays an important role as a transcriptional repressor in development of endometrial cancer and the mutated ARID5B may inhibit the normal function of wild-type ARID5B in the cancer cells.']",

This is particularly concerning for women who have an approximately three-fold higher incidence of thyroid cancer than men. Significant research has been done to elucidate the role of estrogen as a driver of thyroid cancer. Taking the reverse approach, that men have a much lower incidence of thyroid cancer, led us to hypothesize that androgens and/or androgen receptors play a protective role and that PTC represents the escape from androgen-mediated cell regulation. Analysis of AR expression in 24 PTC patient tissue samples indicated a 2.7 fold reduction in AR expression compared to matched normal tissue (P<0.005). This suggests that the reduction of AR levels in the neoplastic process of thyroid tissue may be one mechanism of escape from androgen regulation. To more fully understand the function of androgen/AR in thyroid cells, the AR was stably transfected into 8505C anaplastic/PTC cells. Addition of DHT to the 8505C-transfected clone, 84E7, resulted in AR translocation into the nucleus and a 70% reduction in proliferation, as well as a shift in the cell cycle toward G1 arrest. Transcription profiling using RNA-Seq and gene ontology analysis revealed significant changes in genes associated with proliferation, cell cycle, and cell cycle regulation confirming the proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis above. Further, when we examined G1 associated cell cycle proteins, we found significant decreases in cell cycle progression proteins cdc25a, CDK6, CDK4, and CDK2 as well as significant increases in the inhibitors p27 and p21. Thus, protein, RNA and cell cycle analysis data are concordant and demonstrate an accumulation of cells in G1 when treated with DHT. Together these data demonstrate that expression of androgen/AR in normal thyroid cells may play a protective, anti-proliferative role that is lost in PTC resulting in dysregulation of genes normally under AR control. The differential expression of androgen/AR in males verses females may provide new insight into the different clinical presentations and outcomes between women and men.']",

        "Background":"['The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased three-fold over the last thirty years and the American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 62,980 new cases and 1,890 deaths due to the disease in the United States in 2014. Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy and develops in premenopausal women, at a four-fold higher incidence, than in men. However, PTC exhibits increased aggressiveness with poor prognosis in men diagnosed with the disease. These observations led us to explore the role of androgen and androgen receptor in this disease. Preliminary data from our lab indicates that androgen receptor (AR) acts as a negative regulator of growth as evidenced by a statistically significant decrease in proliferation upon DHT addition to 8505c anaplastic/PTC cells stably transfected with AR. Transcriptional profiling using RNA-Seq and gene ontology analysis, on a 48 hour DHT treated 8505c-AR transfected clone, 84E7, revealed significant changes in the expression of genes associated with proliferation (474 genes, p = 2.4E-24), cell cycle progression (129 genes, p = 6.54E-6) and migration (301 genes, p = 3.77E-30). Amongst the genes which showed the highest significant differential expression was RhoB, a Rho GTPase, with an approximately 50-fold upregulation. Rho proteins are small molecules belonging to the Ras superfamily, known to regulate cell morphology, actin/microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization along with vesicle trafficking. While RhoA and RhoC promote cancer progression and metastasis, the functions of their structural homolog, RhoB, are largely context dependent. Evidence has emerged that RhoB expression may support malignancy in certain cancers, while exhibiting a tumor-suppressor gene function in others. In our system, addition of DHT to 84E7 cells for short time periods of 1, 3 and 6 hours resulted in rapid RhoB mRNA upregulation by 2.5, 8, and 17 fold, respectively, compared to untreated cells. This quick, time-dependent increase in androgen-responsive RhoB may play an integral protective and reparative role which is possibly lost during neoplasticity of thyrocytes. Investigations into various pathways linking RhoB and effector proteins with carcinogenesis would be crucial in assessing the potential of RhoB as a bio-marker for metastatic PTC and thence opening avenues for development of viable therapies for better management of the disease.']",

The analysis focusing in single nucleotide polymophisms (SNPs) in high penetrance genes detected 12 SNPs in six genes. Particularly, two potential pathogenic SNPs mapped at BRCA1 gene, previously associated with PTC and BC, were detected in at least 25% of samples. The evaluation of rare pathogenic alterations shared by all cases revealed two single nucleotide variations (SNVs) mapped at HYDIN gene.

Aberrant expression of genes controlling glycolysis was demonstrated in thyroid cancer cells, but little is known regarding the role of mitochondrial proteins in thyroid carcinogenesis. Cytochrome c oxidase 4 (COX4) plays pivotal roles in oxidative phosphorylation and the cellular response to oxidative stress. COX4 may thus represent a promising therapeutic target.Objectives', 'We examined expression of COX4 in human thyroid tumors and performed functional studies using thyroid cancer cell lines.Material and MethodsExpression of COX4 was examined by immunostaining in 25 follicular adenomas (FAs), 22 follicular cancers (FTCs), 90 papillary cancers (PTCs) and in 48 samples from normal thyroid tissue. FTC-derived (FTC133) and PTC-derived (BCPAP) cell lines were used to create COX4-deficient cells by lentiviral transfection. The efficiency of COX4 inhibition was examined. Mitochondrial membrane potential was examined by JC-1 staining. DNA-damage signaling was examined after cell exposure to  radiation (6-18 Gy). We also determined the effects of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) on viability of thyroid cancer cells with compromised COX4. Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage assays were performed to measure apoptosis.ResultsPositive immunostaining with anti-COX4 was detected in 6/48 (12.5%) normal tissue, 5/20 (25%) FAs, 7/22 (31%) FTCs, and 51/90 (56%) PTCs. The intensity of COX4 immunostaining was significantly higher in thyroid cancers than in either normal thyroid (p = 0.0001) or benign FAs (0.001). COX4 expression was more frequently detected in PTCs than in FTCs (p = 0.03). The mRNA level of COX4 was higher in BCPAP and FTC133 cells compared to normal thyroid. In both cell lines, silencing of COX4 altered intra-cellular distribution of JC-1 staining. In control cells, JC-1 staining was perinuclear, but in COX4-deficient cells it became diffusely cytoplasmic. COX4 silencing affected cell growth and response to radiation in a cell type specific manner. In BCPAP cells, downregulation of COX4 was associated with inhibition of cell growth, block in G1 phase and inhibition of Cyclin D1. In BCPAP cells, COX4 silencing activated DNA-damage signaling and increased sensitivity to  radiation. Inhibitor of glycolysis (2DG) was more efficient against COX4-deficient than COX4-expressing BCPAP cells. In FTC133 cells, silencing of COX4 increased the rate of growth and induced expression of Cyclin D1. COX4 silencing did not increase FTC133 cell sensitivity to radiation nor to treatment with 2DG.ConclusionCOX4 is implicated in regulation of thyroid cancer cell growth and response to DNA damaging or metabolic treatments.

These mutations invariably generate mRNAs containing abnormal coding sequences and premature termination codons (PTC). Normally, these mRNAs containing PTC are degraded by nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) system. However, mRNAs containing PTC located in the last exon are not subject to be degraded by NMD system, and thus expected to generate truncated mutant proteins. We identified 29 novel mutations at coding region mononucleotide repeats (cMNR) genes by a PCR based method and sequencing. The frequency was varying (10% to 90%) in the 10 MSI-H colon cancer cell lines. To confirm the mRNA level, we analyzed the mutant mRNAs from identified genes in colon cancer cell lines and found that the mutant mRNAs were not degraded in cells. For mutant protein detection, we adopted both immunobloting and a target mass method to detect endogenous mutant proteins in cells. By immunobloting analysis, we found rare level of endogenous mutant proteins in cells. Using a target mass method, however, we could detect potential mutant protein candidates and confirmed one of the mutant candidates (VPS37B mutant proteins) is stably expressed in cells by in vitro overexpression experiments. When mutated, VPS37B mutant proteins came to acquire very short neopeptides (only two novel amino acids) which mainly disturb the stable expression of mutant proteins and this might explain the intact expression of VPS37B mutant proteins. Taken together, our findings suggest that frameshift mutations at cMNR of genes usually lead to the rare expression of the mutant proteins in tumor cells but, some mutant proteins with short neopeptides could be stably detected by a highly sensitive target mass method.']",

The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased three-fold over the last thirty years and the American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately 62,450 new cases and 1,950 deaths due to the disease in the country in 2015. Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy with a three-fold higher incidence in women than in men. However, PTC exhibits increased aggressiveness with poor prognosis in men diagnosed with the disease. These incongruent observations led us to explore the role of androgen and androgen receptor in this disease. We found an approximately 70% decrease in median AR expression (p<0.0001) in 24 PTC patient tissue samples, compared to matched, normal thyroid tissue. Preliminary data from our lab indicate that androgen receptor (AR) acts as a negative regulator of growth as evidenced by a statistically significant 48% decrease in proliferation over 72 hours upon 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) addition to 8505c anaplastic/PTC cells stably transfected with AR (clone 84E7). Transcriptional profiling using RNAseq and gene ontology analysis, on 48 hour DHT treated 84E7 cells revealed significant changes in gene expression associated with proliferation (474 genes, p = 2.4E-24) and cell cycle progression (129 genes, p = 6.54E-6). Continuous AR activation (3 to 6 days) resulted in G1 growth arrest, not accompanied by cell death, but rather a flattened, vacuolized cell morphology, indicative of senescence. This was substantiated by an increase in SA-Gal positivity from background 2.47% to approximately 65.5%, which was attenuated by the AR antagonist, flutamide. Three to six day DHT exposure resulted in increased total RNA and protein content measured using Acridine Orange and Sulforhodamine B, respectively. Senescent 84E7 cells failed to resume growth when transferred into DHT-free medium for 3 days, suggesting a permanent growth arrest. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), implicated in Rb-mediated senescence, were found to be doubled by day 6 of AR activation, compared to control cells. Additionally, using flow cytometry, we found increased p21, p27, cyclin D1, FOXO1, and phosphorylation of FOXO1 by days 3-6, suggesting that AR-dependent senescence is mediated via p21 and p27 by FOXO1/3 proteins. Furthermore, cytokine profiling of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) would aid in defining the pro-tumorigenic or tumor-suppressive potential of androgen-induced senescent thyroid cancer cells. Our study elucidates the induction of senescence as a novel function of AR activation in thyrocytes and may indicate a protective role of AR activation in the decreased incidence of thyroid cancer in men.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Cisplatin (CDDP) is a very effective and common treatment in solid malignancies. One of the most important side effects of CDDP is the nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity is a limitating side effect on treatment with CDDP, preventing patients with limit kidney function of receiving the drug and stopping treatment once kidney function has worsened. Cilastatin (Cls) is a specific inhibitor of renal dedydrodipeptidase I (DHP-I) which prevents hydrolysis of imipenem and its accumulation in the proximal tubule. In this work we hypothesized that Cls acts as a nephroprotector against CDDP-induced damage without compromising antitumor activity. Methods', ' Primary cultures of proximal tubular cells (PTCs) and cell lines of different malignancies (colon, breast, ovarian, bladder) were cultured with different concentrations of CDDP (1, 10 and 30 M) in the presence or absence of Cls. Cell viability was assessed with MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Raft staining was measured with toxine B choleric and FasL by confocal microscopy. Results', ' Cls interfered with CDDP-induced FasL signalling at raft level on PTCs brush border. Concomitant treatment with Cls reduced CDDP-induced changes. Several tumoral cell lines were tested with CDDP and Cls together. Cls did not increase or decreased tumor growth alone or in combination with CDDP. CDDP sensitivity was not affected by Cls. Conclusion', ' By binding a DHP-I, Cls blocks CDDP-induced PTCs apoptosis but it does not affect the CDDP antitumoral activity. Our findings suggest that the affinity of Cls for renal DHP-I make this effect specific for proximal tubular cells and may be related to a reduction in intracellular drug accumulation. Cls administration might represent a novel strategy in the prevention of CDDP-induced acute renal injury. Cls treatment could potentially increase the number of patients undergoing CDDP treatment or maintaining treatment. Further clinical trials for renal function preservation in cancer patients are warranted.']",

Therefore, a major challenge is to identify compounds that inhibit Hh signaling downstream of Smoothened.Methods', ' We conducted a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign of 337,000 small molecules using a Hh-dependent differentiation assay of C3H10T1/2 cells into osteoclasts. Primary active screening hits were validated by a cell-based assay cascade including motor neuron differentiation from mouse embryonic stem cells, Gli reporter activation in ShhLight2 cells and proliferation of heterozygous Patched (PTCH+/-) medulloblastoma (MB) cells. Smo binding was monitored in membrane-based Cyclopamine competition assays. To identify the underlying target identification of promising hits, affinity chromatography was performed followed by label-free quantitative (LFQ) tandem mass spectrometry. Effects on cytoplasmic dynein were examined in Smo trafficking and in vitro microtubules motility assays as well as by live cell imaging of labeled endosome movement.Results', ' We identified dynarrestin, a novel aminothiazole that potently blocks Hh signaling and the proliferation of Hh-dependent PTCH+/- MB tumor cells (IC5070nM). Dynarrestin does not bind to Smo and is able to suppress the Hh pathway in the presence of the Smo agonist SAG and following the knockdown of the Hh pathway suppressor SUFU indicating that dynarrestin inhibits Hh signaling downstream of both Smo and SUFU. Chemical LFQ proteomics identified cytoplasmic dynein as the target of dynarrestin. Dyneins convert energy from ATP hydrolysis into motor activity and are essential for many cellular processes, including Hh signaling. Unlike other dynein inhibitory molecules, e.g. Ciliobrevins, dynarrestin inhibits Smoothened trafficking but not ciliogenesis. We further demonstrate that dynarrestin reversibly interferes with endosome movement, proper mitotic spindle orientation, and dynein-based microtubule translocation in vitro without blocking ATP hydrolysis.Conclusions', ' Dynarrestin provides a novel dynein inhibitor with distinct specificity that uniquely facilitates probing dynein function. Given its multiple contributions to Hh signaling, mitosis and other cellular events, dynein remains a highly attractive target for medicinal chemistry programs aimed at exploiting and modulating its complex, poorly understood chemical cycle to interfere with different aspects of activity and function. We believe that unraveling dynein-dependent cellular processes by dynarrestin has great potential for development into novel anti-cancer drugs controlling Hh signaling downstream of Smoothened.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAFV600E mutation represents the most common oncogenic event in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Although at a much lower frequency, different missense point mutations (K601E, G474R, G469R) and complex genetic alterations, such as rearrangements (AKAP9-BRAF) or frameshift mutations (V600EK601del, V599ins, V600D-FLAGT601-605ins, T599I-VKSRdel), have also been reported in PTC. In contrast with PTC, no other alteration different from the V600E substitution has been shown in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). In this study, we sought to determine the functional relevance of particular aminoacid residues, within the BRAF kinase domain, that we found mutated in some ATC. Fifty-four ATC were investigated for the existence of mutations at the activation loop, the glicine-rich phosphate-binding loop and the AKT binding sites of BRAF by means of PCR-SSCP and direct sequence. The structural-conformational changes behind punctual, unreported BRAF mutations and their effect on BRAF catalytic activity, substrate binding and downstream MAPK signalling were evaluated. Besides the V600E mutation, two additional point mutations (G615E and G474R) were detected within the BRAF kinase domain. The prevalence of both mutations, G615E (11% = 6 ATC) and G474R (7.4% = 4 ATC), was much lower than that of V600E (20% = 11 ATC). Interestingly, structural biology studies showed that G615E and G474R induced profound conformational changes within the BRAF kinase domain that resulted in reduced catalytic activity, decreased substrate binding and impaired downstream signalling. The G474R mutant, by preventing the N lobe from folding into a well ordered beta sheet structure, caused a broken or distorted phosphorylation-loop (P-loop). Because the P-loop is pivotal for ATP coordination and phosphotransfer reactions, the kinase activity of the BRAF G474R mutant was severely compromised and BRAF was unable to phosphorylate the downstream substrate. The G615E mutant by disrupting the structural integrity of the activation segment in the C lobe could in addition inhibit substrate binding. Significantly, none of the ATC bearing the G615E or the G474R mutation expressed the phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), which specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated and active forms of ERK1 and ERK2. This observation not only supported the existence of impaired BRAF kinase activity in vivo but also suggested the abrogation of intracellular MEK/ERK signalling in those tumours. In summary, this study demonstrates that G615E and G474R behave similarly to D594V and the kinase-dead BRAFK483M mutant, knocking-down BRAF catalytic activity and downstream MEK/ERK signalling. Clinical trials involving the inhibitor of threonine/serine kinases Sorafenib or kinase specific inhibitors targeting constitutively active BRAF will prove inefficient therapeutic strategies in patients with G615E or G474R mutations.']",

The tumorigenic roles of miR-125b have been studied in various cancers including prostate, colon, glioma etc, and studies have demonstrated that it can act as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the cellular context. It was characterized as an oncogene in prostate cancer and glioma through down-regulation of pro-apoptotic regulators BAK1 and Bcl-2 modifying factor (BMF), respectively. In colon cancer, a recent clinico-pathological study showed that high expression of miR-125b was associated with tumor invasion and poor prognosis. However, the localization of miR125b in normal colon and tumors is currently unknown. Therefore, we aimed to address the precise expression and the functional role of miR-125b in normal colon, which may provide insight on its potential oncogenic effects during carcinogenesis.We performed gene expression analysis of miR-125b in normal colon tissues from 16 pairs of colon top versus basal crypts and 4 pairs of crypts versus stroma by real-time RT-PCR. Colon top and basal crypts were microdissected from frozen sections, whereas pure normal crypts and stromal fractions were isolated from freshly resected human colon specimens. We found that miR-125b was significantly enriched in the basal crypts (p<0.001) and the stromal compartment (p = 0.027). Functionally, knockdown of miR-125b by a specific miRCURY antisense oligonucleotide was able to dose dependently inhibit the growth of a normal colon myofibroblast cell line, CCD18, and significantly increase the mRNA level of several key Hedgehog signaling components, including PTCH (p<0.001), SMO (p<0.001), GLI1 (p<0.001) and its downstream target BMP4 (p = 0.017). Finally, we observed a drastic decrease in both the number and size of normal colon organoids when they were co-cultured with myofibroblasts transfected with miR-125b antisense oligonucleotide, as compared with negative control. Our results suggest that expression of miR-125b in the colonic stromal basal crypt compartment functions to inhibit Hedgehog signaling, leading to paracrine enhancement of colon crypt proliferation and stem cell renewal. Thus, given the well-known importance of hedgehog signaling in colon cancer, our findings suggest that dysregulated miR-125bexpression may contribute to carcinogenesis through disruption of this pathway.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Aberrant HH pathway activation has been identified in several human cancers including colon carcinoma. The GLI proteins downstream of signaling via PTCH and SMO transcriptionally regulate HH target genes. Pharmacologic inhibition of GLI1 and GLI2 by the small molecule antagonist GANT61, or genetic inhibition by a C-terminus deleted GLI3 repressor, GLI3R, induced DNA damage (marked by increased H2AX, p-ATM and p-Chk2) and extensive cell death in human colon carcinoma cells. cDNA microarray gene profiling of human colon carcinoma cells exposed to GANT61 demonstrated changes in expression of genes involved in DNA damage and DNA repair pathways. We therefore investigated the kinetics of key regulatory proteins at the chromatin level. Exposure to GANT61 for 24 hr followed by washout induced DNA damage followed by DNA repair with reversal of cytotoxicity. Employing this model, continuous exposure to GANT61 (DNA damage) resulted in increased chromatin-bound H2AX (DNA DSBs); removal of GANT61 after 24 hr (DNA repair) led to decreased chromatin-bound H2AX. ATM and Chk2 were chromatin-bound during the initial DNA damage phase and later were released. Of significance, HCT15 (a Chk2-deficient colon carcinoma cell line) was less sensitive to blockade of HH signaling, indicating the critical contribution of Chk2 in the DNA damage response. DNA repair is characterized by MDC1-dependent binding of the MRN (MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1) complex at DNA break sites. Following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition, NBS1 nuclear foci colocalized in single cells with MDC1 but not with H2AX foci. During DNA damage, NBS1 demonstrated limited binding to chromatin, while MRE11 and MDC1 binding was induced and sustained. During DNA repair NBS1, MRE11 and MDC1 were highly chromatin-bound, while H2AX was released. Gli3R-mediated inhibition of HH signaling demonstrated a similar chromatin-binding profile among H2AX, MDC1 and NBS1. During DNA damage, MDC1 co-immunoprecipitated with reduced levels of NBS1 and increased levels of H2AX; during DNA repair, increased levels of NBS1 and decreased levels of H2AX co-immunoprecipitated with MDC1. Although chromatin-bound NBS1 was limited during DNA damage and abundant during DNA repair, shRNA-mediated knockdown of NBS1 did not prevent DNA repair following GANT61 exposure (24 hr) and washout, suggesting the existence of redundant DNA repair axes in this mode of DNA damage. The regulation of events upstream and downstream of DNA strand break induction following blockade of HH signaling will provide insight into the critical mechanisms that regulate HH/GLI-dependent survival, currently unknown in any type of cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Understanding the origin of cancer stem cell (CSC) heterogeneity within a tumor type is one of the major challenges in the CSC field currently. In this study, we report that Ptch+/ mice develop three distinguishable subtypes of medulloblastomas, and that CSCs in each subtype depend on different signaling pathways for self-renewal and survival. In all three tumor subtypes, the tumor initiating cell frequency is low (< 1/300 cells) and 100% of the tumors can be serially passaged in vivo for at least 5 generations, indicating that each tumor subtype contains rare, long-term self-renewing cells with tumor-initiating ability. However, CSCs in Type I tumors require in vivo microenvironment for survival/proliferation; hence, they do not grow in stem cell cultures in vitro. CSCs in Type II and Type III tumors form tumorspheres but require different growth factor signaling pathways for self-renewal and proliferation. Remarkably, except in rare cases where spontaneous tumor progression occurs, the CSC phenotype remains identical to the original tumor through multiple in vivo serial passages, indicating that molecular and cellular phenotypes of CSCs in each tumor are stable, cell-intrinsic characteristics of CSCs. Based on their in vitro culture requirements and their gene expression patterns, we hypothesized that different CSC subtypes arise from different cell-of-origin. We tested this hypothesis by activating the SHH pathway in cell type-specific manner using genetically engineered mice. We provide strong evidence that Type I tumors arise from EGL progenitors and that Type II tumors arise from embryonic neural stem cells. We also show that Type I and Type II tumors can spontaneously progress onto Type III tumors both in vivo and in vitro, and that this progression is characterized by gain of chromosome 6. Importantly, the three tumor subtypes can be distinguished at the bulk tumor level by unique gene expression patterns. Analyses of subtype-specific signature genes against human medulloblastoma gene expression data set published by Kool et al., show that different subtypes of Ptch+/ tumors correspond to different human medulloblastoma subtypes. Importantly, they do not all correspond to the SHH-subtype. In summary, we propose that the same initiating oncogenic event can lead to generation of CSCs with distinct molecular and cellular phenotypes depending on the cell of origin. Our observation provides a partial explanation for the failure of SHH-inhibitors to cure SHH-tumors in preclinical and clinical trials. Our findings suggest that identification and analyses of CSCs in each tumor may be necessary for efficient stratification and targeting of CSCs in histologically indistinguishable tumors.']",

        "Background":"['The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is the most commonly dysregulated pathway in many human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, targeting PI3K signaling has become a promising approach in cancer therapy. Although studies have indicated development of resistance to PI3K inhibitors, the molecular mechanism of drug resistance is largely unknown in NSCLC. Here, we sought to identify new potential biomarkers and pathways that confer resistance to PI3K inhibitors in NSCLC. To this end, we used reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) to assess the expression levels and activation status of 137 proteins involved in signaling pathways implicated in lung cancer. Seventy-four NSCLC cell lines were treated with the PI3K inhibitor BAY 80-6946 and lysates were collected for proteomic analysis. First, we evaluted the association between drug sensitivity (IC50) and RPPA expression levels at baseline in sixty NSCLC cell lines. Correlation test was applied to each marker vs drug and Wilcox Rank test was performed to compare the smallest and largest one third of all the cell lines. We found increased phosphorylation and inactivation of pro-apoptotic protein Bad and phospho-LKB1 in the resistant cell lines. An inverse correlation was found for phosphorylation and inactivation of c-Src. Interestingly, activation of EGFR and increased levels of PTCH and PKC were found in the resistant cell lines. Next, paired t-test was applied to each marker comparing the difference between drug and control treated cells. As expected, treatment with BAY 80-6946, significantly downregulates components of PI3K/mTOR pathway, as illustrated by decreased levels of phospho-Akt (-4.28-fold relative expression) and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (-9.64-fold), phospho-p70S6K (-3.47-fold) and phospho-mTOR (-1.42-fold). We observed elevated expression of negative regulators of mTOR pathway, LKB1 (1.11-fold), AMPK (1.12-fold) and phospho-AMPK (12-fold). On the other hand, our analysis identified new potential pathways of resistance that are activated upon PI3K inhibition. We found increased levels of phospho-EGFR (P<0.0001), PTCH (P<0.0001) and PKC (P<0.0001). We observed activation of c-Src pathway upon treatment with BAY 80-6946, total and phospho-Src (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001). Accordingly, key downstream survival cascades regulated by c-Src, FAK (P<0.0001), Stat5 (P<0.0001), phospho-Stat5 (P<0.0001) and phospho-Stat3 (P<0.0001) were upregulated in treated cells. Our results suggest that PI3K inhibition leads to EGFR/MAPK and c-SRC/Stat signaling activation in vitro, suggesting a compensatory pathway that may allow NSCLC survival. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of Src/Stat pathway as an important mechanism of resistance to PI3K inhibitors in NSCLC and may be clinically relevant targets for combination therapy.']",

The increased aggressiveness of the disease and poorer clinical outcome in men and postmenopausal women may be due to androgen/androgen receptor (AR) related functions. FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) is a member of the immunophilin family and plays a role in steroid receptor function. Further, FKBP5 regulates the NFkB and AKT pathways and is thought to be relevant to the neoplastic process. Immunohistochemical analysis of 38 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) specimens indicated that androgen receptor is expressed in both normal and cancerous epithelial cells, in both men and women. Analysis of AR expression in thyroid cell lines indicated that the normal thyroid cell line, Nthy-ori 3-1 and PTC cell lines BCPAP and TPC-1 expressed very low levels of AR, as measured by qRT-PCR and western blotting (>1000 fold less than the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP). In contrast, PTC/anaplastic 8505C cells expressed higher levels of AR protein (approximately one third the level expressed in LNCaP cells). Upon addition of androgen, AR in 8505C translocated into the nucleus (as determined by immunocytochemistry) and upregulated transcription of both AR (1.7 fold) and FKBP5 (1.8 fold). To more fully understand the function of androgen/AR in thyroid cells, the AR cDNA from pSG5-AR was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1+ expression vector and stably transfected into thyroid cell lines. Primers for qRT-PCR of the endogenous or the transfected gene were designed. The 84E7 clone of transfected 8505C cells expressed 68 fold higher levels of AR mRNA than 8505C and 16 fold higher AR protein expression (5 fold higher AR protein expression than LNCaP). Upon addition of DHT to clone 84E7, AR translocated into the nucleus, and increased AR and FKBP5 mRNA expression (3 fold and 13 fold, respectively). The association between androgens/AR and upregulation of FKBP5 in thyroid cancer cells suggests that FKBP5 may play a role in thyroid cancer etiology and the different clinical presentation and outcomes between young women and men/postmenopausal women.']",

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and incidences are rising. MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in playing a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of thyroid cancer, as evidenced by the high incidence of non-overlapping mutations of the genes encoding RET and TRK, as well as of NRAS, HRAS, KRAS and BRAF. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is commonly associated with mutations of the RAS family of oncoproteins, while papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is often associated with mutations in BRAF. To determine whether mode of MAPK activation played a role in thyroid cancer development in mice, we generated HrasG12V and BrafV600E knock-in models. We report that a thyroid specific knock-in of HrasG12V and Pten inactivation leads to the development of FTCs and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTCs) by 47-52 weeks of age in HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre mice. In stark contrast, mice with a thyroid specific knock-in of BrafV600E and loss of Pten (BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre) rapidly develop PDTCs and anaplastic thyroid cancer with complete lethality by weaning, suggesting that Braf and Hras, in cooperation with PI3K signaling, likely play distinct roles in the development and progression of disease. We next sought to dissect the role of Hras versus Braf activation in FTC versus PTC development. We derived stable cell lines from HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre and BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre tumors in order to identify cellular and molecular consequences of Hras versus Braf activation and their potential impact on tumor phenotype. We have found significant differences in phosphorylation of kinases in response to Hras versus Braf activation. Hras activation leads to increased phosphorylation of mTOR effectors, while Braf activation increases CREB activation. Studies are ongoing to identify the molecular mechanism of these observed differences. We have also shown a significant decrease in the growth of HrasG12V/Ptenhom (p=0.0009) and BrafV600E/Ptenhom (p=0.0001) cells treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, suggesting that activated Hras or Braf-even in the context of Pten loss-partially relies on MAPK signaling to reach its full oncogenic potential. We have recently employed a PCR array approach to identify differences in the expression of genes related to the MAPK pathway in HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom cell lines. We noted an up-regulation of Myc, Cdkn1a, and Sfn in BrafV600E/Ptenhom cells in comparison to HrasG12V/Ptenhom cells, which may contribute to the different pathophysiology of HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom tumor sub-types.

        "Background":"['The GLI genes, GLI1 and GLI2, encode transcription factors that regulate target genes at the distal end of the canonical Hedgehog signaling (HH) pathway (SHH->PTCH->SMO->GLI), tightly regulated in embryonic development, tissue patterning and differentiation. In cancers, both GLI1 and GLI2 are oncogenes, aberrantly and constitutively activated. Oncogene-driven signaling pathways, in particular KRAS/BRAF in colon cancer, circumvent the HH-GLI axis to further drive GLI activation, which serves as a nodal channel for oncogenic signals, and provides a pivotal role for GLI in cell survival. GANT61, a small molecule inhibitor of GLI-dependent transcription, terminates oncogenic HH-GLI and KRAS/BRAF-GLI signaling, inducing DNA damage and extensive cell death in seven human colon carcinoma cell line models examined. The overall goal is to understand how GANT61 induces cell death by inhibiting GLI-dependent transcription mechanisms. We have demonstrated that GANT61 is', ' a) specific for binding to GLI, and does not bind to DNA or to other transcription factors; b) selective for cancer cells vs normal cells that lack constitutive GLI activation. Inhibition of GLI1 and GLI2 by GANT61 rapidly reduces GLI binding to consensus sequences in target gene promoters and inhibits GLI-dependent transcription. Stalling of Pol II occurs adjacent to GLI binding regions at target gene promoters (FOXM1, BCL-2), associated with inhibition of GLI binding, enrichment of Pol II, and modification of promoter-bound pause (DSIF, NELF) or pause-release (P-TEFb) factors within a 300bp region of the FOXM1 promoter. Single-stranded DNA and RNA', 'DNA hybrids determining R-loop formation (distributed throughout the nucleoplasm) occur at sites of stalled Pol II, inhibited by RNAseH. Consistent with transcriptional inhibition, GANT61 induced DNA damage (H2AX foci) in S-phase and non-S-phase cells, recognized at the initiation of S-phase (G1/S), prior to the onset of cell death. This may be due to one of two mechanisms', ' 1) The GLI1 target gene FOXM1, and its transcriptional target CDC6, downregulated in GANT61-treated cells, regulate Pre-Replication Complex assembly at G1/S thereby inhibiting the initiation of DNA replication; this controls outcome of the GANT61 response, dependent on GLI; 2) Transcriptional R-loop formation can conflict with DNA replication in GANT61-treated cells. These events inhibit initiation of DNA replication from unfired origins at early replicons and inhibit further progression through S-phase. GLI1 and/or GLI2 are constitutively activated in epithelial cancers of the GI tract, brain tumors, melanoma, pediatric solid tumors, liver, lung, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Further, KRAS is mutated in one third of all human cancers and in 50% of colon carcinomas. Targeting GLI therefore has the potential for high impact in therapeutics, and is anticipated to lead to new approaches and therapeutic strategies for treating cancer.']",

Canonical HH signaling engages the transmembrane receptor PTCH, the intermediary signaling molecule SMO, and the transcriptional regulators of target genes and the HH signaling response, GLI1 and GLI2. In colon cancers, GLI is aberrantly regulated by oncogenic signaling pathways, driving cell survival and genomic instability involved in oncogenesis, progression and metastasis. Using the small molecule inhibitor of GLI1/GLI2 transcription, GANT61, we have demonstrated that inhibition of HH signaling at the level of GLI induces extensive cell death in human colon carcinoma cell line models in contrast to targeting SMO. Cells with acquired resistance to SMO inhibitors also remain highly sensitive to GANT61, underscoring GLI as a critical target in colon cancer. We have now identified a previously undescribed, novel mechanism by which cancer cells evade cell death following protracted, targeted exposure of GLI by GANT61. The classic pharmacologic approach of stepwise increasing drug selection did not produce a proliferative colon cancer cell line resistant to GANT61, confirming the critical importance of GLI genes to cell survival. In contrast, prolonged exposure (1-3 weeks) of HT29 cells to semi-lethal concentrations of GANT61 (10 M; HT29-G10), induced GLI1/GLI2 inhibition, reduced proliferation, decreased appearance of H2AX nuclear foci, and increased methylation of histone H3K9 (H3K9me1-3) within the GLI1 and GLI2 promoters. Methylation of H3K9 lysine residues is correlated with either an inactive or silent state of gene expression, and can exist in mono-, di-, or tri- methylated states. It has been demonstrated by others that methylation at H3K9 in the promoters of p53, p21Waf1 or DHFR genes, can regulate cell proliferation or function at the G1/S transition. In addition to GLI1 and GLI2, H3K9 methylation was also observed in HT29-G10 cells in the promoter regions of FOXM1 and CDC6, G1/S regulatory genes. These are GLI target genes, which regulate the G1/S transition, or PreReplication Complex assembly at initiation of DNA replication, respectively. Data suggest that the GLI2->GLI1->FOXM1->CDC6 promoters are coordinately regulated by H3K9 methylation in a pathway to promote gene silencing, reduce gene transcription, and reduce cell cycle transition at G1/S, constituting a unique mechanism of acquired resistance to drugs that target GLI. It is anticipated that these approaches will provide new insight into critical targets that determine HH-dependent survival, and lead to the translation of agents that target or regulate GLI function.']",

Oncogene-driven signaling pathways, specifically KRAS/BRAF in colon cancer, circumvent the HH/SMO axis to converge on and activate GLI.

These findings thus delineate GLI as a critical target in colon cancer. HT29 (BRAFV600E mutant), SW480 (KRASG12V mutant) and HCT116 (KRASG13D mutant) cells are sensitive to the MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, a novel, selective, ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of MEK1/2 currently in Phase II clinical trial. AZD6244 inhibited transcription of GLI2, but not GLI1 (mRNA expressed at low level), suggesting integration of oncogenic KRAS/BRAF signals at the level of GLI2 transcription. In experiments with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, MG132 (proteasome inhibitor), and AZD6244, stabilization of GLI1 and GLI2 was determined not to be a mechanism of MEK/ERK-dependent GLI activation in HT29 cells. The ZIC2 transcription factor effects translocation of GLI proteins to the nucleus and regulates GLI transcriptional activity. GLI1 and GLI2 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with ZIC2 in HT29 cells. Further, ZIC2 was extensively bound to the promoters of GLI1 and GLI2, and binding was significantly reduced by AZD6244 (ChIP analysis). ZIC2-dependent transcriptional regulation requires phosphorylation (p-ZIC2) by DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). The DNA-PKcs inhibitor, NU7441, inhibited GLI2-luciferase reporter activity. How GLI activation is regulated in cancer cells remains poorly understood, yet GLI marks an important target in cancer biology. We propose a model in which oncogenic KRAS/BRAF regulates GLI2 transcription involving ZIC2, which is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs and regulated by ERK. Using drugs that inhibit GLI1/GLI2 transcription and studies of GLI activation in oncogenesis, these findings will provide new insights into critical targets that determine HH-dependent survival, and for the translation of drugs that target dysregulated HH signaling in cancer.']",

We are currently investigating this association further; first by examining the expression of two major RET protein isoforms, RET9 and RET51, in this panel of tumours, and second, by investigating the coexpression of RET with another group of proteins associated with tumour progression, the integrin family.

        "Background":"['Recurrence of breast cancer after chemotherapy is thought to arise from resistant breast cancer stem cells which are eventually able to repopulate the tumor. The hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway has been shown to regulate the proliferation and survival of breast cancer stem cells, and has been shown to promote resistance to chemotherapy through the activation of multi-drug resistance and prosurvival pathways. Here we report that exposure of heterogenous breast cancer cell lines (T47D and SKBr3) to low doses (1-10nM) of docetaxel resulted in activation of HH signaling. Increased levels of sonic HH were detected in supernatants of breast cancer cells at 6- hours post-treatment. This release was accompanied by increased expression and nuclear translocation of Gli-1, peaking at 24 hours after exposure. Additionally, increased expression of the PTCH receptor was observed by western blotting in these cells 24 hours after treatment, indicating activation of a Gli-1 induced negative feeback loop. Increased mammosphere formation was observed in cells after preincubation with low dose docetaxel. Secondary sphere forming efficiency (SFE) was also increased in pretreated cells. The increase in SFE was similar to that of cell lines cultured in the presence of recombinant SHH. Additionally, the increase in SFE observed after docetaxel treatment could be blocked by the addition of sublethal doses of the hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine. These results suggest that hedgehog pathway activation induced by docetaxel treatment could result in increased stemness of breast cancer cell lines. We propose that chemotherapy may activate stem cell signaling pathways, resulting in expansion of cancer stem cells and increased drug resistance.']",

        "Background":"['Colorectal cancer constitutes the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States with limited therapeutic options and poor survival for advanced stage disease. The GLI genes, GLI1 and GLI2, are transcription factors, which act at the distal end of the Hedgehog pathway (SHH->PTCH->SMO->GLI) to regulate organogenesis and differentiation in the colon. In cancer GLI1 and GLI2 are activated, are oncogenes, and we have shown are critical to the survival of colon carcinoma cells. Inhibition of GLI by the small molecule inhibitor, GANT61, induces extensive cell death downstream of H2AX foci formation in CC. GANT61 rapidly reduces GLI binding to consensus sequences in target gene promoters (1 hr) and inhibits GLI1- and GLI2- dependent transcription. Using the known crystal structure of the five zinc finger GLI1-DNA complex we demonstrated, by computational docking, that GANT61 binds to the GLI1 protein, but not to the DNA binding site, via H bonds at amino acids E119 and E167. These sites lie within the groove between zinc fingers 2 and 3, on the opposite surface from, but in close proximity to, the GLI1-DNA binding regions. GANT61 is not observed to dock with DNA. The predicted binding constant for GANT61 (Kd = 2.6 M) is consistent with GANT61 concentrations required to induce cell death in CC. Surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) confirmed the model predictions using immobilized GLI1 or DNA and GANT61 or GANT61/DNA as anylate, respectively (KD= 7.5 M; IC50= 3.2M). Following GANT61 treatment of CC we demonstrated transcriptional stalling of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) at sites of early elongation adjacent to GLI binding regions at target gene promoters. This is associated with modification of promoter-bound pause (DSIF, NELF) or pause-release (P-TEFb) factors. Single-stranded DNA (R-loops) is detected at sites of stalled Pol II; H2AX foci are induced. Consistent with inhibition of transcription, GANT61 induces H2AX foci in S-phase and non-S-phase cells. A transient intra-S-phase checkpoint is induced and cells accumulate in early S without further progression prior to the onset of cell death. The GLI1 target gene FOXM1, and its transcriptional target CDC6, regulate the G1/S transition and initiation of DNA replication, and are decreased in GANT61-treated cells. Data suggest that', ' 1) GANT61 inhibits GLI-mediated transcription by direct binding to GLI; 2) GLI-dependent Pol II transcription is stalled at early elongation in GANT61-treated cells, with formation of R-loops and DNA DSBs; 3) GLI1, FOXM1 and CDC6 regulate events at G1/S and initiation of DNA replication that controls outcome of the GANT61 response. These studies open the door to exploring the role of GLI as a therapeutic target. Since dysregulated HH signaling occurs in a wide variety of human cancers, the proposed studies are of broad impact.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is an RNA surveillance pathway that selectively degrades mRNAs bearing premature translation termination codons (PTCs). In addition, NMD also regulates the expression of a subset of physiological mRNAs containing upstream open reading frames (uORFs), spliceable introns in the 3 untranslated region (3-UTR) and those that undergo aberrant alternative splicing. Cancer cells produce many mRNAs harboring PTCs because of high frequency of mutations either in the coding region or in the splice sites that result in aberrant splicing. Thus, cancer cells may depend on NMD for survival. Inhibiting NMD provides an attractive cancer therapeutic strategy as it rescues mRNAs bearing NMD features, some of which may produce functional proteins. Therefore, it is important to identify NMD targets and their NMD-inducing features in cancer cells. In the current study, by using NMD inhibition approach, we identified mRNA transcripts and pathways that are regulated by NMD in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines.Methods', ' To identify NMD targets, UPF1, a key component of NMD pathway was depleted by RNAi in NSCLC cell lines. mRNAs regulated by NMD were identified by micro array and RNAseq approaches and selected NMD targets were confirmed by real-time PCR. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) was performed to identify cancer pathways affected by NMD inhibition. Migration, proliferation and clonogenic assays were performed to assess the effect of NMD inhibition on cancer phenotype.Results', ' Our microarray and RNAseq analysis results indicated that in NSCLC cell lines, NMD regulates the expression of a number of physiological transcripts derived from non-mutant genes. These include transcripts involved in integrated stress response, apoptotic pathways and tumor suppressor activity. We showed that tumor suppressors DMTF1, and p53 undergo NMD-susceptible alternative splicing in NSCLC cell lines and that NMD-regulated p53 isoforms are partially functional. Our results also demonstrated that mRNA transcripts derived from TSC1 and GADD45A, tumor suppressors that negatively regulate mTOR pathway, are also upregulated upon NMD inhibition in NSCLC cell lines. Concomitantly, RPPA analysis revealed that NMD inhibition resulted in downregulation of components involved in mTOR pathway. NMD inhibition also resulted in reduced cell viability and migration.Conclusions', ' NMD regulates the expression of physiological transcripts involved in integrated stress response, apoptosis and tumor suppressor activity and impacts cancer phenotype in NSCLC cell line models.

        "Meeting_name":" RET and integrin crosstalk provides functional plasticity",
        "Background":"['The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. RET becomes activated upon formation of a complex with the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand and GDNF-family receptor (GFRa), which leads to activation of multiple downstream signalling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK, STAT3, and SRC. Constitutive activation of RET, through translocations or missense mutations, leads to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), respectively. Also, RET expression has been detected in pancreatic and breast cancers, and has been linked to increased metastatic potential. In order to clarify the underlying role of RET in tumour progression, we examined the relationship between RET and two integrin subunits, 1 (ITGB1) and 3 (ITGB3). Integrin proteins are important for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and focal adhesion (FA) formation. Functionally, integrins are important for cell-adhesion and migration as they provide traction and leverage for cell movement. Previously, we have shown that RET is able to increase cell-migration and adhesion, and that both ITGB1 and ITGB3 are important for these processes. Here, we show that RET-mediated cell-migration is persistent over 24 hours, and that patterns of cell-adhesion fluctuate over this time, predictably representing different forces needed to move across the microenvironment. Cell-adhesion is increased upon 1 hour of GDNF treatment, but is lost between 3-12 hours of GDNF treatment. Interestingly, we observed that ITGB1 activation downstream of RET, detected by co-immunoprecipitation with paxillin, is transient, and lasts for 1 hour. Conversely, ITGB3 activation downstream of RET, detected using an active heterodimer-specific antibody, is sustained between 1-12 hours of GDNF treatment. These results demonstrate unique functional roles for ITGB1 and ITGB3 downstream of RET. We also examined the importance of signalling pathways downstream of RET for integrin activation, and found that, in a 2D collagen environment, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK are important for RET-mediated FA formation. However, in a 3D collagen environment where cells formed spheroids, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 are important for cell-outgrowth, downstream of RET activation. This likely represents different cellular responses needed to overcome environment-specific obstacles. Finally, we showed evidence for a relationship between RET, ITGB1 and ITGB3 in tumour progression using a cohort of various clinically annotated thyroid cancer samples. Ultimately, we have shown a role for in activation of two integrin subunits, ITGB1 and ITGB3, downstream of RET and how each of these proteins may contribute to metastatic events, particularly those involved in thyroid cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Epidemiological studies of geographical variations in breast cancer mortality rates have found increased death rates at higher latitudes in USA and other countries 1. This breast cancer latitudinal gradient is hypothesized to be mediated by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) - produced vitamin D3. We first have tested this latitudinal hypotheses using the well-described C3(1)/Tag transgenic murine mammary carcinogenesis model2. We have found that UVR significantly prolongs palpable tumor - free survival (13523 vs.11818 days) and reduces the tumor burden and multiplicity (2.91.6 vs. 7.22.3 tumors), but does not alter the time between the appearance of the first palpable tumor and death in Tag female mice. Therefore we have focused on the effects of UVR on earlier stage carcinogenesis. Tag transgenic female mice have a time-dependent increase in the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) - like incidence. Thus, Tag mice develop ductal epithelial atypia in 50% of mice at age 8 wks, with progression to intraepithelial neoplasia (resembling human DCIS) in 70-90% of mice (in at least one gland) at 10-13 wks, and DCIS-like changes and early invasion in 100% of mice at age 14-15 wks. We compared weekly the similarity of histological changes between the pairs of mammary glands and found no significant gland site-to-gland site variations. UVR treatment, 350mJ/cm2 thrice weekly from age 6 wks to 15 wks, reduced both the percentage of DCIS-bearing mice (65, 60, 51, 32 and 20% reduction at week 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14) and the percentage of DCIS-bearing glands in each animal (82, 55, 66, 20 and 19% reduction at week 9, 11, 13, 14 and 15). The mechanism of the UVR-mediated prevention of the murine mammary carcinogenesis is unclear but there is evidence favoring a Hedgehog (HH) signaling-dependent mechanism, since D3 is a potent inhibitor of the HH signaling pathway, which is upregulated in many cancers including breast cancer3-5. Consistent with this idea we found that UVR reduces DCIS-like changes in Ptch+/- mice. Taken together our results support our hypothesis that inhibition of early stage mammary carcinogenesis by UVR-produced vitamin D3 underlies the latitudinal gradient. 1. Garland, F. C. et all.

        "Background":"['The incidence of thyroid cancer (TCa) has doubled in the last decade. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), that comprises of 80% of all TCas, is treatable with great outcomes. However, undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), with very poor prognosis, is considered a clinical challenge and currently a losing battle. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms responsible for various forms of TCa are largely unknown. We believe that the cells of histopathologically distinct regions of a heterogeneous thyroid tumor are governed by different sets of master gene regulators. The smart manipulation of such master genes will be able to selectively destroy cancer cells but not normal tissue, opening a novel and much more effective avenue in the thyroid cancer targeted gene therapy. Our analysis established the gene hierarchical governance in each region based on their Gene Commanding Height (GCH). GCH is a measure that combines the gene expression coordination with other genes and the expression stability among biological replicas provided by the internal homeostatic mechanisms. Here, we provide experimental evidence that standard papillary (BCPAP) and anaplastic (8505C) human thyroid cancer cell lines have different master regulators. We identified the master regulators of BCPAP and 8505C, and determined their GCH. Transfection of master gene regulators of a particular cell line has significantly larger effects on the cell line they command than on other cells. We found that the stable transfection with TMEM194A, a nuclear envelope protein, regulated twice more genes in BCPAP than in 8505C cells. The analysis using human thyroid cancer cells reaffirmed our hypothesis of the existence of hierarchical master gene regulators and that the phenotypic changes can be manipulated with the introduction of these genes. We further validate these concepts using human thyroid biopsy samples. We found substantial differences in the GCH scores of cancer versus normal tissue of a surgically removed 32.0mm papillary carcinoma from the left lobe of a 33y old male. Because of such differences between the cancer region and the normal tissue, manipulation of cancer regulators is expected to affect the cancer cells in a greater degree than the normal cells. These results suggest that we have defined a master gene regulator hierarchy in thyroid cancer and extrapolation of this analysis to compare anaplastic and papillary thyroid cancer will lead to novel gene therapeutic modalities. Our long-term goal is to identify master regulators of cancer nodules for each patient and develop personalized cancer therapy targeting these master regulators.']",

The HH signal transduction pathway plays crucial roles in organ morphogenesis and is active during embryonic development but quiescent in terminally differentiated cells. Binding of HH ligands to PTCH1 relieves its inhibitory activity on the pathway activator SMO leading to pathway activation and upregulation of target gene expression including the transcription factor Gli1 that serves as marker of pathway activation. It is reactivated in many solid cancers including NSCLC as we have previously demonstrated and proven to be the key oncogenic driver in tumors such as skin basal cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to determine if HH pathway regulates cell growth and survival of MPM cells and to evaluate the efficacy of pathway blockade using SMO antagonists (SMO inhibitor GDC0449 - GDC or the antifungal drug itraconazole -ITRA) or Gli inhibitors (GANT61 or the anti-leukemia drug arsenic trioxide - ATO) in suppressing the viability of not only NSCLC but also MPM cells.METHODS. Expression of main components of HH pathway in 8 MPM cells was assessed by qRT-PCR. Suppression of HH/SMO-mediated signaling by these pathway antagonists was determined by LightII cells. Selective knockdown of SMO to inhibit HH signaling was achieved by siRNA in 3 MPM cells H2373, Gardner and H2452. Cell viability following treatments with GDC, ITRA, GANT61or ATO were evaluated in a panel of 8 MPM cells and 8 NSCLC cells using MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined by annexinV/PE staining and flow cytometry.RESULTS. All MPM cells, similar to previously demonstrated in NSCLC cells, express varying levels of HH ligands, PTCH1, SMO with readily detectable Gli1 observed in 7/8 of MPM cells by qRT-PCR. SMO siRNA mediate 2- to 3-fold reduction of SMO and also of Gli1 gene expression by qRT-PCR, indicating significant HH pathway blockade. This was associated with 406% to 708% reduction of cell viability (p<0.01 versus non-target siRNA controls). All 4 pathway antagonists completely blocked HH activation in LightII reporter cells. Treating MPM or NSCLC cells with HH inhibitors resulted in 1.5- to 4-fold reduction of Gli1 expression. GANT61, ATO, ITRA and to a lesser degree GDC significantly suppressed viability of all cancer cells at low microM concentrations. More importantly, ITRA, ATO, GANT61 induce significant apoptosis (ranging from 30% to 60%) in representative MPM or NSCLC cells.CONCLUSIONS. HH signaling is active in MPM and regulates cell viability. ATO and ITRA are as effective as the prototypic SMO inhibitor GDC and the Gli inhibitor GANT61 in suppressing HH signaling in MPM and NSCLC cells. Pharmaceuticals that are FDA-approved for other indications but recently found to have anti-HH activity such as ATO or ITRA may be repurposed to treat HH-dependent MPM or NSCLC cells.']",

        "Background":"[\"Dysregulation of the proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, which encodes the high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway aberrantly associated with numerous malignancies including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, prostate, pancreatic and breast cancers. The Mediterranean diet is associated with lower incidences of cardiovascular disease, age-related cognitive disease and cancer. (-)-Oleocanthal is a naturally occurring minor secoiridoid from extra-virgin olive oil with potent anti-inflammatory activity via its ability to inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 and anti-Alzheimer's activity. Cyclopamine and its 11-oxo derivative jervine are C-nor-D-homosteroidal alkaloids with known potent teratogenic effects that induce cyclopic malformations in sheep. The jervane Veratrum alkaloids cyclopamine and jervine and the veratrane alkaloid veratramine were among the early known natural products that blocked the expression of the Hh pathway targets PTCH1 and GLI1, lowering Bcl2 levels and inducing apoptosis in many tumors. Computer-assisted molecular design (CAMD) identified oleocanthal as a potential virtual c-Met inhibitor hit. Oleocanthal inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of the epithelial human breast and prostate cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and PC-3, respectively. Oleocanthal demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity and inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Met kinase in vitro. CAMD study of our library of natural, biocatalytic, and semisynthetic jervane and veratrane alkaloids suggested that compounds with C-3-keto functionality with 4,5 or 1,2 and 4,5 exhibited high virtual Hh binding affinity scores and possible Hh pathway activity. These compounds showed significant ability to inhibit the growth, proliferation, and migration of the prostate metastatic cancer cell line PC-3, which aided the establishment of a preliminary structure-activity relationship. (-)-Oleocanthal and Veratrum alkaloids can have potential therapeutic application for the control of c-Met- and Hh-dependent malignancies.\"]",

        "Background":"['Sonic hedgehog (SHH) tumors account for roughly 25% of all pediatric medulloblastoma. Aberrant signaling of the SHH pathway, typically via Patched-1 (PTCH) mutation, results in cell proliferation and subsequent tumor formation. Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors such as sonidegib have been used clinically to combat tumor progression and have shown initial promise. However, many tumors acquire resistance to therapy. Combination therapy with an additional agent targeting another node in pathways affecting cell-cycle progression such as ribociclib, a cyclin D-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, may improve therapy and reduce tumor burden by delaying or preventing the development of resistance. Identification and evaluation of effective anti-cancer drug combinations, along with their schedule, sequence, and dosage are a major challenge due to the large number of possible combinations in addition to the cost and time involved in experimentally testing each possible permutation. Mathematical models can aid in the discovery of optimal drug combinations. A mathematical model of the SHH and Cyclin D / CDK / Rb pathways was designed to evaluate effective sequences and schedules of sonidegib and ribociclib for the treatment of SHH medulloblastoma. The model was parameterized using in vitro data from studies treating the NIH3T3 cell line with sonidegib and ribociclib singly or in combination. Flow cytometry analysis was used to quantify response to treatment by obtaining cell-cycle phase distributions for each drug as a single agent or in combination. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the model parameters were evaluated via Latin Hypercube Sampling and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient analysis to interpret the effects of amplification or deletion of nodes in the pathway, evaluate potential targetable nodes, and identify sensitive parameters that need robust quantification. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the formation of Cyclin D/CDK4/6 complexes and the dephosphorylation of Rb were significant nodes that should be included in the model. Uncertainty analysis indicated that the majority of the variability lies in the distribution of cells in G0/G1 and S phase. Simulations of single agent treatment predict a similar response between sonidegib and ribociclib, with co-treatment indicative of an additive effect. Optimal control theory methods are being applied to this model to help determine effective sequence, schedule, and dose of sonidegib and ribociclib to improve efficacy and reduce drug resistance in the treatment of SHH medulloblastoma.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' The hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a crucial role in the growth and patterning during embryonic development. We have shown that Hh pathway is constitutively activated in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and could be a new therapeutic target for the invasive-type of breast cancer. Purpose', ' We investigate a possibility that Hh pathway is also a therapeutic target for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Methods', ' Total 138 tissues from 62 cases of IDC, 50 cases of DCIS and 26 cases of benign breast tumors (BBT), which were surgically resected in Department of Surgery and Oncology in Kyushu University from 2001 to 2008, were used in this study. The expressions of Hh-related molecules including Shh, Ptch1 and Gli1 were determined by immunohitochemistry. Expressions of Hh-related molecules were also partly examined by real-time PCR using laser capture microdissection technique. The degree of Hh pathway activation was estimated by the ratio of nuclear translocation of Gli1. Results', ' In immunohistochemistry; 1)Positivity of Shh, Ptch1 and Gli1 were 98.4%, 92.0%, and 95.2% in IDC. Those were 24.0%, 32.0%, and 24.0% in DCIS but were less than 10% in BBT. 2) Degree of Hh pathway activation in IDC was significantly higher (40.95  19.00%) than that in DCIS (12.28  13.80%) and BBT (1.73  2.39%). In real-time PCR; Expressions of Hh-related molecules in IDC and DCIS were higher than those in BBT (p < 0.01). Conclusions', ' Data suggest that Hh pathway contributes to the progress to IDC from DCIS. Thus, Hh pathway could be a useful therapeutic target for preventing the progress to invasive stage from non-invasive stage of breast cancer.']",
