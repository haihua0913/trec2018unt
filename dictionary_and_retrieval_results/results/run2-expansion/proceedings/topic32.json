It is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is present in a poor-risk subgroup of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which represents 25% to 30% of adult ALL and 3% to 5% of childhood ALL. So far, the BCR-ABL aberration has been detected by cytogenetics, FISH or PCR, which are time consuming and require special facilities.

        "Background":"['The molecular etiology of human progenitor reprogramming into self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSC) has remained elusive. While DNA sequencing has uncovered spliceosome gene mutations that promote alternative splicing and portend leukemic transformation, isoform diversity may also be generated by RNA editing mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes that regulate stem cell maintenance. In this study, whole transcriptome sequencing of normal, chronic phase (CP) and serially transplantable blast crisis (BC) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitors revealed increased interferon- pathway gene expression in concert with BCR-ABL amplification, enhanced expression of the interferon responsive ADAR1 p150 isoform and a propensity for increased A-to-I RNA editing during CML progression. Lentiviral overexpression experiments demonstrate that ADAR1 p150 promoted expression of the myeloid transcription factor PU.1 and induced malignant reprogramming of myeloid progenitors. Moreover, enforced ADAR1 p150 expression was associated with production of a mis-spliced form of GSK3 implicated in LSC self-renewal. Finally, functional serial transplantation and shRNA studies demonstrate that ADAR1 knockdown impaired in vivo self-renewal capacity of BC CML progenitors. Together these data provide a compelling rationale for developing ADAR1-based LSC detection and eradication strategies.']",

Methods', ' Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from drug-resistant CML patients were collected.

We took advantage of ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) in order to', ' 1) resolve qualitatively and quantitatively the complexity of mutated populations surviving TKIs; 2) investigate their clonal structure and evolution in relation to time and treatment.Methods - We retrospectively performed a longitudinal analysis of 111 samples from 32 CML or Ph+ ALL patients who had received sequential treatment with multiple TKIs and had experienced sequential relapses accompanied by selection of TKI-resistant mutations. All samples had already been scored by SS. UDS of the BCR-ABL KD was done using Roche 454 technology (lower detection limit, 0.1%). Seqnext software was used for alignment and variant identification; Jalview and Figtree softwares were used for haplotype and phylogenetic reconstruction.Results - UDS showed that SS often misclassifies or underestimates BCR-ABL KD mutation status. In more than half of the cases, UDS revealed that up to five minor mutations with 1-20% abundance were present, either in samples scored as wild-type by SS or in samples already bearing one or more dominant mutations. The high degree of complexity was even more evident when the clonal relationships of multiple mutations were reconstructed and the relative abundance of all mutant subclones coexisting at each timepoint was assessed. This revealed that identical mutations may be acquired in parallel by independent subclones (e.g., one wild-type and one already harboring a mutation), via the same or different nucleotide changes leading to the same amino acid substitution (convergent evolution). Longitudinal quantitative follow-up showed that the landscape of all competing mutant subclones is highly dynamic, and that dominant subclones may be replaced as quickly as within one month in case of selective pressure change. Earlier identification of emerging TKI-resistant mutants was made possible by UDS.Conclusions - 1) sequential changes in the selective pressure exerted by TKIs may result in a heterogeneous mosaic of subclones harbouring different mutations or mutation combinations2) The ecosystem of mutant subclones is highly dynamic', ' acquisition of additional mutations dictates quick shrinkage or expansion of subclones over time3) Inherent sensitivity to a specific TKI is necessary but not sufficient to determine the fitness of a mutant subclone', ' competition with coexisting subclones also concurs to shape its fate4) Reasoning on the basis of mutations detectable by SS may not always be sufficient to predict responsiveness to a TKI.Supported by Fondazione CARISBO, PRIN, IGA MZCR NT11555.']",

Valproic acid (VPA; Orfiril) has been a well-known anti-epileptic drug worldwidely, and belong to the class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. The aim of this research is to determine the anti-leukemic effects of combination of dasatinib and VPA or their mechanism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. In this study, dasatinib showed potent inhibitory effects on VPA-treated AML cells that were associated with induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest and also apoptosis including the cleavage of PARP, caspase-3, -7 and -9. Moreover, inhibitors of caspase-3 and -9 (Z-DEVD-FMK and LEHD-CHO) efficiently inhibited dasatinib-induced apoptosis in VPA-treated AML cells. Therefore, dasatinib/VPA-induced cell death occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Also, inhibitors of MEK/ERK (U0126 and PD98059) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) efficiently inhibited dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis. The combination of dasatinib and VPA differentiation capacity of AML cells is more powerful than each drug alone. So the combination is enough to push AML cells to death strongly by G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK controls dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis as an upstream regulator. Finally, co-treatment of dasatinib and VPA is contributed to AML cell death by regulation of differentiation capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that dasatinib and VPA together have a potential for anti-leukemic therapy.']",

        "Background":"['A range of hypotheses have emerged as to why imatinib (a targeted inhibitor of bcr-abl) seems unable to eliminate the most primitive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, such as bcr-abl amplification and clonal evolution. The biology of the CML imatinib-resistant cell is of critical importance to understanding why despite high percentages of initial clinical responses to imatinib (>80% of patients in chronic phase at some point obtaining complete cytogenetic remission), resistance, relapse and/or progression occurs in 20-30% of cases and most patients in remission still have residual disease detected by sensitive PCR monitoring of the CML specific bcr-abl transcripts. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well, patients are typically treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen that leads to clinical responses in 80-95% of patients. However, over half of these patients will relapse and eventually die of disease suggesting that a subpopulation of leukemic cells are capable of both surviving treatment and causing regrowth of the tumor. In both diseases, it has not been definitively established what the identity of the cells responsible for resistance and relapse is, nor what combination of mutations, gene expression changes, and alternative splicing events are required for these cells resistant phenotype. Assessing changes in gene expression in the bulk samples provides a valuable overall picture of the phenotype of the predominant cell type is or if there are large changes in expression in less frequent cells, but will completely mask changes exhibited by rare cells. One limiting factor in our ability to study more levels of heterogeneity in leukemia subpopulations is the lack of appropriately powerful and sensitive techniques to assay more complex facets of cellular behavior in such small populations. We have developed several multiplexed, high sensitivity analysis techniques and applied them to study multiple facets of cell behavior and identity in rare cell samples, down to the single cell level. By analyzing expression and genotype in smaller samples, direct from cells, we can analyze heterogeneity in expression and alternative splicing, combined with both cell surface markers and the presence of multiple mutations. These innovative techniques have allowed us to study clonality in AML samples in detail via a robust assay that can identify multiple mutations occurring concurrently in single cells. We have also optimized a protocol to simultaneously assay gene expression of 24 in 100-500 cell samples from flow sorted leukemia cell populations. Finally multiplexed assays for alternative splice variant detection in single cells has enabled us to study whether alternative splice variant expression of several genes occurs concurrently in the same cells, or in different cells of the population. With these techniques in hand we have the unique opportunity to begin studying the biology of these diseases from a previously unrealistic angle.']",

Despite strong initial responses to these drugs, many patients acquire resistance over time through acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations such as T315I, compound BCR-ABL mutations or through BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms. Even though the next generation pan-ABL inhibitor, Ponatinib, targets all know resistant ABL mutations, some patients don't benefit from Ponatinib and in these cases resistance to TKI therapy may be due to BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms. We analyzed the mechanism of ABL-TKI-dual-resistant CML cells independent of new BCR-ABL mutations and tested the sensitivity of these resistant cells to the PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941 and/or the MEK inhibitor GDC-0973.Methods\", ' We created ABL-TKI-dual-resistant cells and clones through prolonged treatment of K562 and KCL22 cells with Imatinib and then Dasatinib. The cells and clones were tested for sensitivity to Imatinib, Dasatinib, Ponatinib, GDC-0941 and GDC-0973. Whole genome copy number scan (Oncoscan) and targeted deep sequencing using GAII were used to identify BCR-ABL mutations and newly acquired somatic gene alterations.

These resistant cells and clones had acquired new somatic mutations in p53, BRCA2, PTEN, RB, SMARCA4 and PBRM1, but not in BCR-ABL. Phosphoprotein profiling showed low phosphorylation of the BCR-ABL substrates c-ABL, SHC and FAK indicative of BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of resistance. Activity of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways varied across the resistant clones. However, high levels of the AKT substrate, FOXO-1 directly correlated with Dasatinib resistance and with GDC-0941 sensitivity. Sensitivity to GDC-0941 also correlated with modulation of phospho-FOXO-1.

While effective in controlling disease in chronic phase, these inhibitors often fail to completely eliminate Bcr-Abl+ CML cells and also fail to achieve durable remissions for advanced CML and Bcr-Abl+ acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Our lab employed a large-scale synthetic lethal shRNA screen to identify genes involved in CML survival upon treatment with the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib (IM) [Cancer Cell. 2010;18(1)', '74-87]. This screen identified several genes involved in energy utilization including a component of pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase. CML proliferation depends on Bcr-Abl-driven glycolysis for energy production. Upon IM treatment, we hypothesized that these cells are forced to rely on other sources of energy including the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, and that targeting alternative energy production pathways will enhance IM-mediated elimination of CML cells. Thus, we predicted that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition would cooperate with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) to eliminate Bcr-Abl+ leukemia. Indeed, our experiments have shown that knocking down pyruvate dehydrogenase in human blast crisis Bcr-Abl+ CML cells (K562) greatly sensitized cells to IM in vitro. Conversely, supplementing the cell culture media with increasing concentrations of methyl-pyruvate protected K562 cells from IM treatment. Moreover, we found that the mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor Oligomycin A (OA) also synergized with IM to kill CML cells in vitro. Interestingly, the doses of OA are far below the IC50 and do not affect the oxygen consumption rates, indicating that mitochondrial respiration is not inhibited. These OA doses alter mitochondrial transmembrane potential and increasing superoxide levels. In addition, OA enhanced elimination of Bcr-Abl+ cells by a Bcr-Abl TKI in vivo and prolonged disease-free survival in a mouse model of Bcr-Abl+ B-ALL. Notably, drug doses of OA used had no apparent adverse effects on these mice. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism as an adjuvant drug therapy may prevent the survival of residual Bcr-Abl+ CML cells upon tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.

        "Background":"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder by BCR-ABL, which can transform hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into leukemic stem cells (LSCs) with a limitless capacity for self-renewal. Despite substantial prognostic improvement of CML by a specific debulking of tumor burden with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting ABL kinase, imatinib-treated CML patients in chronic phase can relapse and progress to blast phase due to the remnant CML stem cells. Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1), a key transcription factor in HSC regulation, is known to predict poor outcomes in myeloid malignancies, however, incapability of prospective isolation of EVI1-high leukemic cells precludes the functional evaluation of intra-individual EVI1-high cells. In this study, we hypothesized that EVI1 is a valuable marker of CML stem cells as well as HSCs and aimed to cover in depth the regulation of CML stem cells by Evi1. Introduction of CML into Evi1-IRES-GFP knock-in mice, a versatile HSC-reporter strain, enabled us to separate Evi1-high CML cells from the individual and revealed that Evi1 was predominantly enriched in the stem cell fraction and associated with an enhanced proliferative as well as a leukemia-initiating capacity. Comparison of gene expression profiles between Evi1-high and -low CML cells revealed that Evi1-high CML cells had a more quiescent feature and a less differentiated feature than Evi1-low CML cells, suggesting that Evi1-high CML LSK cells could keep self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, Evi1-high CML cells exhibited apparent resistance to TKIs in vivo. Given that Evi1 heterozygosity ameliorated CML development in vivo and that the combination of Evi1 and BCR-ABL caused acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice resembling blastic transformation of CML, Evi1 could regulate CML development as a potent driver. In accordance to our data of Evi1-trafficking CML mouse, our single-cell analysis of primitive or differentiated subsets from primary CML-CP samples show that EVI1 was highly expressed in stem cell-enriched CD34+CD38-CD90+ cells, which implied that EVI1 could mark CML stem cells as well as normal HSCs. This point can be translated to human CML cases like that high EVI1 means the increasing number of CML stem cells. As opposed to Evi1-reporter CML models, in AML model by MLL-ENL oncogene, Evi1-high MLL-ENL leukemic cells showed no advantage in leukemia initiation compared to Evi1-low cells. Other Evi1-reporter AML models by MOZ-TIF2 and TEL-PDGFR+AML1-ETO never generated Evi1-high fraction, suggesting the high affinity of Evi1 for stem cell disease such as CML. In conclusion, high Evi1 can define the population of CML stem cells which are resistant to nilotinib. Combinatorial analyses of Evi1-IRES-GFP allele CML animals and single cells from primary CML-CP patients also covered in depth the critical regulation of CML stem cells by Evi1.']",

Normal myeloid differentiation is a tightly controlled process involving the coordinated action of specific transcription factors, which are dysregulated by chromosomal translocations, DNA mutations, epigenetic changes, and aberrant gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression in leukemias. Previously, we identified decreased miR-150 expression in CML and AML cell lines and primary cells when compared to normal bone marrow, and determined miR-150 expression is decreased in CML by the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Furthermore, lentiviral expression of miR-150 in AML cell lines and primary CML patient samples induced myeloid differentiation as detected by CD11b expression, morphologic differentiation, and colony forming ability in methylcellulose, both in the absence and presence of the differentiating agents. In this study, we elucidated the targets responsible for miR-150 induced differentiation. Expression of the validated miR-150 target MYB, a transcription factor involved in blocking differentiation in progenitor cells, was only decreased in miR-150 expressing cells in the presence of differentiating agent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Furthermore, lentiviral overexpression of MYB lacking miR-150 binding sites in the 3-UTR partially decreased the CD11b expression in the presence and absence of ATRA in both control and miR-150 expressing HL60 cells. These results suggest additional miR-150 targets are involved in differentiation besides MYB. To identify additional miRNA-150 targets, we profiled changes in mRNAs associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) using RNA-immunoprecipitation of Ago2 followed by microarray gene expression profiling in miR-150 versus control HL60 cells. Furthermore, although almost all functional investigations have focused on the mature strand, we have found that miR-150 and its partner star strand miR-150* are expressed at almost equal levels in normal myeloid hematopoietic cells, and are investigating the individual contributions of their separate targets in induction of differentiation. In conclusion, miR-150 expression promotes myeloid differentiation through targeting transcription factor MYB and additional targets, while downregulation of miR-150 in myeloid leukemias contributes to the block in differentiation.']",

Current CML therapies target the tyrosine kinase domain of Bcr-Abl, but due to their non-curative nature, resistance to these drugs is common. Therefore, new treatments are needed for those patients refractive to available therapies. Bcr-Abl homo-oligomerization via its N-terminal coiled coil (CC) domain is required for tyrosine kinase activity. Our previous work has shown that it is possible to inhibit Bcr-Abl activity by targeting the CC domain with a altered version of the CC domain, known as CCmut3, delivered as a plasmid. In this study, CCmut3 is delivered to cells as a protein by utilizing a leukemia-specific cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). Here, recombinant CPP-CCmut3 was expressed, purified, and tested for its anti-oncogenic activity. CPP-CCmut3 was able to enter two leukemic cell lines (K562 and Ba/F3-P210) and inhibit Bcr-Abl activity as shown by induction of necrosis/apoptosis via 7-AAD/Annexin V staining, reduction of oncogenic potential in colony forming assays, reduction of cell proliferation, and inhibition of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation (kinase activity). Further, CPP-CCmut3 did not enter non-leukemic cell lines (HEK293 and MCF-7). While CPP-CCmut3 was able to enter the parental, non-leukemic Bcr-Abl- Ba/F3 pro-B cell line, it revealed no signs of activity in the assays performed, as expected.

Ponatinib, as the third generation BCR-ABL TKIs, has the potential activity against CML with T315I mutant BCR-ABL whereas high frequency of serious adverse events limits its clinical use. Through a compound library screen, we identified a novel compound PBA2, a dual kinases inhibitor of GSK3 and BCR-ABL, as a promising agent for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML. Not only can PBA2 inhibit cell growth but also induce terminal cell differentiation in a series of kinase mutant CML cell lines as well as T315I mutation. Remarkably, the mechanism of action of this compound involved the simultaneous inhibition effect of BCR-ABL and GSK3, which could be a fruitful approach to suppress the -catenin/CBP signal pathway that promoted the interaction of -catenin/p300, leading to growth inhibition and subsequent terminal differentiation. More importantly, we found a novel molecular link between CBP and BCR-ABL. We showed that CBP could regulate BCR-ABL expression through activating CREB which binds to the BCR-ABL promoter in CML cells to start transcription, and the BCR-ABL in turns affect the expression level of CBP.

        "Background":"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the first cancer that was shown to originate from a genetic abnormality - the Philadelphia chromosome translocation, and production of its constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase product, BCR-ABL. The disease progresses slowly from chronic phase to accelerated phase, and later transforms to blast crisis (BC) stage. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subset of tumor cells that have acquired certain treatment-resistant stem cell properties. High levels of RNA editing are associated with a primitive transcriptional program typical of human embryonic stem cells, and RNA editing plays an important role in both embryonic hematopoietic cell fate determination and in maintenance of normal hematopoiesis. Human RNA editing occurs primarily in secondary structures created by Alu retroelements and is carried out by enzymes such as the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. Among these, ADAR1 was also recently shown to be required for normal hematopoiesis by suppressing interferon-induced apoptosis. Our research focuses on dissecting the role of ADAR-mediated RNA editing in normal human hematopoietic progenitor cell development compared with malignant editing programs that may be activated in leukemia stem cells (LSC) during the progression of human CML. Our data demonstrates that BC LSC harbor increased levels of the interferon-responsive ADAR1 p150 isoform compared with chronic phase (CP) progenitors and normal cord blood progenitors. Expression of this isoform also exhibits a positive correlation with BCR-ABL expression levels - an effect which is specific to BC progenitors, suggesting that ADAR1 expression correlates with disease progression from CP to BC. In vitro hematopoietic progenitor assays with normal cord blood progenitors and CP samples transduced with lentiviral vectors overexpressing human ADAR1 reveals a significant shift in cell differentiation fate towards granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) colonies, which has been shown to be the initiating LSC population in CML Correspondingly, a progression towards erythroid lineage was observed in BC CML LSC transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA targeting ADAR1. Further qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the mechanism through which ADAR1 drives LSC and HSC differentiation towards myelopoiesis involves regulation of PU.1, which in turn inhibits GATA1 expression. Moreover, in vivo studies in a robust humanized CML mouse model showed a significant decrease in LSC serial transplantation potential of lentiviral shADAR1-transduced BC progenitors transplanted into neonatal RAG2-/-c-/- mice. Together, these data support a crucial role for ADAR1 in cell fate determination and self-renewal potential of hematopoietic stem cells in both normal human progenitors and in malignant LSC that drive disease progression and therapeutic resistance.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is driven by the hyperactive fusion kinase Bcr-Abl, generated by a chromosomal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. This oncogenic tyrosine kinase builds up its own signaling network with various proteins such as the docking protein Gab2 or the Src kinase Lyn. As a result, the cells become addicted to the constant signals derived from this fusion kinase. This is the reason why selective Bcr Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as Imatinib mesylate or dasatinib, became so successful in the therapy of CML. Despite the great success of these TKIs in CML treatment, TKI resistance remains a serious clinical problem. These resistances can be caused by mutations in the Bcr-Abl oncogene, like the clinical relevant T315I mutation or by aberrant activity of components of the Bcr-Abl signaling network. In that regard, we could show that the overexpression of Gab2 or the expression of a hyperactive mutant of Lyn can confer TKI resistance.Using different CML cell lines and models we aimed to identify new approaches to overcome TKI resistances caused by Bcr-Abl mutations or aberrant downstream signaling. Therefore, we screened inhibitors for their ability to overcome Gab2 mediated resistance or to inhibit the activity of T315I mutated Bcr-Abl. We identified the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and axitinib, both clinical approved as second line drugs in renal cell or hepatocellular carcinoma, as compounds reducing the viability of Bcr-AblT315I transformed cells. Interestingly, these inhibitors were highly active against TKI resistant Bcr-Abl positive cells in contrast to non-transformed cells.

Although BCR/ABL inhibitor imatinib has shown unprecedented efficacy for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), resistance to this agent due to BCR/ABL mutations or increased protein expression poses a significant clinical problem, thereby arguing for novel therapeutic approaches. BCR/ABL gene amplification frequently occurs in blast crisis and BCR/ABL expression is required for its mutation. BCR promoter contains Sp1 binding sites and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BORT) disrupts Sp1 transactivation, therefore, we hypothesized that BORT could abolish BCR/ABL expression leading to disrupted kinase activity. However, the fast clearance and the inability to reach target cells in vivo have limited its application. As such, we designed a liposomal BORT (L-BORT) and transferrin receptor (TfR)-targeted L-BORT (Tf-L-BORT) for the objective of enhancing BORT delivery efficiency. We observed that there were 3.6-fold and 10.4-fold increases in cellular uptake of L-BORT and Tf-L-BORT, respectively, compared to that of the free drug. We evidenced a 2.7-fold augmented chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX) in cells exposed to subtoxic concentration of BORT, with a decrease in IC50 from 8 M to 300 nM. Tf-L-BORT further reduced IC50 of DOX to 90 nM. These data indicated the enhanced chemosensitizing efficacy of the L-BORT formulations. When single tumor cells from K562 tumor bearing mice were treated by subtoxic L-BORT combined with DOX, a synergy of toxicity was evidenced by 70-fold increased chemosensitivity (p<0.05). Tf-L-BORT was more effective in chemosensitizing tumor single cells than L-BORT, with decreased IC50 of DOX to 94 nM. Pharmacokinetic study in mice after i.v. bolus injection showed that L-BORT had slower tissue distribution (T1/2, 7.3 min vs. 2.9 min), increased elimination phase half-life (T1/2, 82.9 h vs. 68.3 h), decreased clearance (CL, 4.2 mL/h vs. 27.7 mL/h), and increased area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC, 4714.1 hng/mL vs. 721.4 hng/mL) compared to the free drug. This indicated a significant and potentially beneficial change in BORT pharmacokinetics in vivo. Mechanistically, when K562 cells were exposed to L-BORT (0, 10, 30 and 60nM) or DOX (0, 100, 200 and 500nM) for 48h, BCR/ABL protein was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the combination of L-BORT with DOX synergistically abrogated BCR/ABL and Sp1 protein expression. Altogether, these results highlight the therapeutic relevance of disrupting BCR/ABL protein expression and strongly support the utilization of L-BORT alone or in combination with DOX to treat CML patients harboring overexpressed BCR/ABL.']",

Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a stem cell disease induced by Bcr-Abl hybrid gene. In an attempt to provide better understanding of the mechanisms by which Bcr-Abl mediates cellular transformation, lncRNA microarray was used to determine the differentially expressed non protein-coding genes in K562 human leukemic cells in response to disruption of Bcr-Abl expression. All the lncRNA genes whose expressions were altered by at least 2-fold were clustered and displayed. We further investigated the functional involvement of selected lncRNA genes in regulating cell proliferation, cell survival and tumor formation. Interestingly, expression of a long intergenic noncoding RNA which we named as lincRNA-Up6 was found to be greatly up-regulated by silencing the Bcr-Abl expression in K562 cells. We showed that forced over-expression of lincRNA-Up6 sensitized imatinib-induced apoptosis in Bcr-Abl transformed cells. In addition, we observed that over-expression of lincRNA-Up6 significantly inhibited K562 xenograft growth in nude mice. Furthermore, we found that lincRNA-Up6 was involved in negative regulation of STAT5-dependent expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL protein. Importantly, our experiments showed that expression of lincRNA-Up6 had profound effects on signaling pathways associated with development of leukemia stem cells of CML, resulting in inhibition of Bcr-Abl-mediated tumor formation. Together, these results suggest that lincRNA-Up6 suppresses Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis, and the tumor suppressor function of lincRNA-Up6 may be of significance for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating CML.Citation Format', ' Jilong Chen, Guijie Guo, Qingzheng Kang.

The various BET inhibitors developed show strong anti-tumor effects against a broad range of hematologic malignancies.

At present, however, predictive biomarkers of BET inhibitor sensitivity have not been identified. We hypothesize that the chromatin state characterized by various histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, methylation, etc.), can drive sensitivity to BET inhibition.

Lentiviral transduction of the BCR/ABL gene in Ba/F3 cells increased EZH2 levels in parallel with phosphorylation of STAT5. Notably, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that STAT5A bound to a promoter region of the EZH2 gene, resulting in an increase in the transcriptional activity of EZH2 in leukemia cells. Importantly, downregulation of EZH2 by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) inhibited the expression of the antiapoptotic protein XIAP and increased the miR-219 levels associated with a decrease in hypermethylation of miR-219-1 CpG islands. Moreover, overexpression of miR-219 decreased the levels of XIAP in CML cells. Since the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) of XIAP contains miR219-5p-complementary binding site, miR-219 might modulate the expression of XIAP through binding of miR-219 on the 3-UTR of XIAP.Taken together, BCR/ABL positively regulates the expression of EZH2 via STAT5 signaling.

        "Meeting_name":" Recombinant stapled proteins for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia",
        "Background":"['The oncoprotein Bcr-Abl is the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Current therapies target the tyrosine kinase domain of Bcr-Abl, but due to their non-curative nature, resistance to these drugs is common. Therefore, new treatments are needed for those patients refractive to available therapies. Bcr-Abl homo-oligomerization via its N-terminal coiled coil (CC) domain is required for tyrosine kinase activity. Our previous work has shown that it is possible to inhibit Bcr-Abl activity by targeting the CC domain with a peptidomemetic known as CCmut, delivered as a protein using a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP-CCmut). CPP-CCmut selectively enters leukemic cells and inhibits Bcr-Abl, as seen by Western blot, 7AAD, Annexin V, cell proliferation, and colony forming assays.This leukemia cell-permeable CPP-CCmut protein domain is our lead compound for CML therapy, but to be translatable to the clinic it must be modified to improve proteolytic stability. For this reason, we created stapled versions of this CPP-CCmut. Stapled peptides are resistant to proteolysis, and are emerging as a viable strategy for disrupting protein-protein interactions in diseases including HIV and cancer. Until recently, peptide stapling required incorporation of unnatural amino acids; therefore these peptides were created via solid-state synthesis. However, the synthesis of the 81 amino acid CPP-CCmut is no trivial matter. The ability to staple a longer sequence such as our protein domain is now possible using thiol-ene coupling. This exciting new chemistry allows for the stapling of recombinant proteins at substituted cysteine residues (instead of stapling substituted unnatural amino acids incorporated into synthetically made peptides). Thiol-ene coupling is used here to staple recombinant CPP-CCmut, and provides a path for translation of our lead compound to the clinic.Molecular modeling has identified optimal locations for staples on CPP-CCmut, which include 29/36, 36/43, 50/57, 57/64, as well as double staples 29/36-50/57 and 36/43-50/57. These staple locations still allow for dimerization of CPP-CCmut with Bcr-Abl, as indicated by free energy calculations and helicity. The staple locations have also been optimized for maximal coverage from proteolytic degradation.This work acts as a proof-of-concept that proteins (not just peptides) can be stapled, thus greatly expanding the variety and complexity of stapled proteins for use in the exciting field of targeting protein-protein interfaces to treat disease.']",

        "Background":"['The marketed BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib (Gleevec) is a very successful targeted anti-cancer therapy. It has revolutionized the treatment of early stage or chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Unfortunately, a proportion of CP patients experience suboptimal responses to BCR-ABL TKIs, and progress to blast crisis (BC) stage of CML with poor survival rate. A potential cause of the resistance to TKI is the elevated level of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which has been found to be a consistent feature in patient-derived BC-CML samples. Importantly, both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that the MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1/2) phosphorylate eIF4E on Ser209, and that the overexpression of eIF4E drives oncogenesis in a variety of cancers including BC-CML. Furthermore, several reports have indicated that eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser209, as well as eIF4E overexpression, is critical to tumor progression.We found that a BC-CML cell line, K562, that expresses a serine to alanine phospho-mutant at position 209 of eIF4E, shows reduced ability to form tumors in mice compared to wildtype eIF4E. In addition, our recent work has demonstrated the importance of the MNK-eIF4E axis in activating BC leukemia stem cell (LSC) function (Lim et al., PNAS18; 110(25)', 'E2298-307, 2013). These data highlight the critical importance of MNK1/2-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation in cancer progression and maintenance, and suggests that inhibition of MNK1/2 is an attractive therapeutic approach to treat BC-CML. Consequently, we set out to identify selective inhibitors of the MNK1/2 kinases to treat BC-CML patients.Here, we report our hit finding strategy, as well as our hit to lead optimization process. Results describing structure activity relationships, pharmacokinetics properties, and biochemical characteristics of a highly specific MNK1/2 inhibitor, are presented. Our data demonstrate that drug-like molecules can be developed to potently and specifically inhibit the MNK kinases. We also show that simultaneous inhibition of MNK and BCR-ABL is effective at inhibiting BCR-ABL-driven growth and proliferation, as well as inhibiting the MNK-eIF4E-dependent self-renewal function of BC-LSCs. A combination of selective MNK and BCR-ABL inhibitors may provide clinical benefit to BC-CML patients.']",

However therapy resistance in a significant proportion of patients remains a severe clinical problem. Aside mutations of the BCR/ABL gene, regulation of cellular transporters or downstream factors may contribute to non-response. We aimed to investigate micro-RNA expression profiles in peripheral leukocytes of 21 newly diagnosed CML patients without BCR/ABL-mutations in order to identify biomarkers to treatment-response of imatinib. Methods', ' Ten responders (molecular remission) and 11 non-responders were included. Expression of 667 microRNAs was analyzed using a TaqMan Low-Density Array system. Relative fold change of microRNAs between groups was calculated according to the 2^-Ct method. MicroRNAs with a fold change>2 and a P-value<0.01 were considered significant. MicroRNAs with minor expression (Ct-value>20) were not included. Putative targets of dysregulated microRNAs were considered, if predicted by at least three databases, and further analyzed using the DAVID-bioinformatic database. Results', ' Four microRNAs were significantly deregulated (miR-7, miR-744*, miR-616, miR-212) between responders and non-responders, when being treatment-nave, predicted to have 97 potential targets. In depth target analysis showed that transcription regulators (21% of the predicted targets) are highly enriched compared to normal gene expression background of humans. Pathway analysis revealed six genes involved in cancer pathways, whereas four of them are directly involved in the chronic myeloid leukemia pathway (SMAD4, NRAS, RB1, RAF1). In responders seven microRNAs were deregulated before and after therapy, whereas five other microRNAs were deregulated within the group of non-responders. Three deregulated microRNAs were identified in both groups. Most predicted target genes are involved in MAPK signaling and exocytosis, 13% of the targets were predicted to be transcription regulators, and 18% cellular (especially uptake) transporters. Conclusion', ' We identified distinct microRNA pattern comparing blood samples of responders and non-responders prior to imatinib therapy. Predicted target genes were primarily transcription factors and oncogenes. In contrast, transporters and exocytotic pathways are in addition frequent targets of microRNAs deregulated after imatinib therapy.

        "Background":"['The hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the presence of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein that is essential for leukemogenesis and accumulation of neoplastic cells. The Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) represents the standard treatment for CML. However, a number of CML patients develop imatinib resistance and several mechanisms of resistance have been described. While most mutant forms are sensitive to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the T315I mutation remains completely refractory to imatinib, as well as to these agents. Treatment of CML patients harboring T315I mutation is still an unmet medical need in the imatinib and post-imatinib era. We have identified P2745, a novel orally bioavailable small molecule that is effective in imatinib resistant mutations and particularly T315I mutation form to address this unmet medical need. In vitro P2745 showed potent cytotoxicity (IC50 0.8-5 M) in twelve Bcr-Abl mutated imatinib resistant cell lines including T315I compared to wild type Bcr-Abl cell lines. P2745 did not show cytotoxicity upto 30 M in normal fibroblasts (MRC-5 and WI-38) and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells thus indicating specificity towards cancerous cells. P2745 inhibited pCrkLTyr207 in imatinib-resistant CML cell lines accompanied with down regulation of Bcr-Abl protein levels. Additionally, it up regulated tumor suppressor protein SMAR-1 which resulted in negative regulation TGF-/SMAD-dependent pathway as demonstrated by low phosphorylated levels of SMAD2 and SMAD3, two key players implicated in the preservation of the malignant progenitor population, and partly responsible for the resistance to treatments targeting Bcr-Abl. P2745 also induced significant apoptosis in imatinib resistant cell lines (Y253F, T315I and E255V) but not in normal MRC-5 cell line. In addition, like imatinib it induced 80-90 % apoptosis in cells derived from CML patients. In vivo studies demonstrated significant (p<0.001), dose dependent efficacy in imatinib resistant T315I cells xenograft in SCID mice. It also demonstrated significant in vivo efficacy in Bcr-Abl wild type imatinib sensitive K-562 (p<0.05) and Ba/F3 (p<0.001) xenografts in SCID mice. PK-PD evaluation in imatinib resistant xenograft experiments indicated that at the efficacious dose, P2745 modulated proteins responsible for CML pathogenesis (60-80 %), which correlates with the levels of P2745 in the tumors. This unique mechanism of action makes P2745 a promising clinical candidate for CML patients harboring T315I mutation.']",

However, with more prolonged BCR-ABL kinase inhibition, we observed a time-dependent increase in the ability of EPO to rescue STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation. After 24hrs of BCR-ABL inhibition, EPO treatment led to a significant increase in both JAK2 activation and the GTP loading of RAS relative to vehicle treated cells. These data suggest that BCR-ABL kinase activity hampers the ability of JAK2 to activate STAT5 and RAS/MAPK . Further, 24hr treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 allowed for a comparable degree of EPO-mediated JAK2 activation, suggesting that the negative regulation of JAK2 is mediated at least in part by a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism. These observations were subsequently validated in an isogenic system utilizing TF-1 cells. Similar to the EPO/JAK2 axis in K562 cells, TF1-BCR-ABL cells exhibit attenuated GM-CSF signaling relative to control TF1-puro cells, which was restored only after prolonged BCR-ABL inhibition. Significantly, we have observed that BCR/ABL-expressing cells irreversibly commit to apoptosis before growth factor signaling is fully restored.Conclusions', ' Our data suggest that BCR-ABL-mediated oncogene addiction is a consequence of a high level of physiologic negative feedback mechanisms that dampen growth factor receptor signaling. Our findings also help reconcile recent evidence that JAK2 inhibition restores the sensitivity of CML stem/progenitor cells to ABL TKI treatment in vitro with the observation that JAK2 is completely dispensable for BCR-ABL-induced myeloid disease in mice.']",

Expression of BCR-ABL135INS in K562 cells was sufficient to conferred resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib in a dose-dependant fashion.

        "Background":"['CNDAC, the active form of sapacitabine, is a nucleoside analog which kills cells by a unique mechanism of action. Incorporation of CNDAC triphosphate into DNA results in a single-strand break, which is converted to a one-ended double-strand break (DSB) upon subsequent collapse of the DNA replication fork. CNDAC-induced DSBs are repaired predominantly through the homologous recombination pathway which consists the key recombinase Rad51 and its associated proteins. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm; its central pathogenesis is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This abnormal chromosomal fusion results in the formation of a chimeric gene that encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, Bcr-Abl, which promotes CML through stimulating downstream signaling cascades for cell survival and deregulated cell growth. Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase modulates DNA repair mechanisms to protect leukemic cells from DNA damage induced cell death. In response to DSBs, it phosphorylates Rad51 at Tyr315 which enhance the damage repair process. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that inhibition of Bcr-Abl will further sensitize cells to CNDAC. To test this postulate, we used the CML cell line K562 as well as murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with wild-type Bcr-Abl (Ba/F3p210wt) or the Bcr-Abl mutant (Ba/F3p210T315I) as model systems. Two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) were utilized to inhibit Bcr-Abl. Imatinib, the first generation TKI, is only effective inhibiting wild type Bcr-Abl. Ponatinib, a subsequent TKI, is potent in inhibiting both wild type and mutant Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinases. First, these cells were treated with CNDAC, imatinib or ponatinib alone to determine the IC50 values for each drug using PrestoBlue cell viability assay. Based on the single drug IC50s, combinations of CNDAC with imatinib or ponatinib were applied to these cell lines and their combination indexes were calculated by CalcuSyn software. We found that CNDAC and imatinib were synergistic in K562 and Ba/F3 wild type Bcr-Abl cells while they were additive in the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant cells. In contrast, ponatinib sensitized CNDAC treatment as their combination was synergistic in all these cell lines. Finally, to investigate the mechanism underlying the observed synergism, K562 cells were treated with either equitoxic concentrations of CNDAC, imatinib or ponatinib alone or in combinations for 48 hours when lysates were collected for immunoblot analysis. It was found that when Bcr-Abl was inhibited, the phosphoryation of Rad51 at Tyr315 was reduced, phospho H2AX and cleaved caspase 3 were increased in response to CNDAC. Thus further sensitization of CNDAC was a result of deficient damage repair due to Bcr-Abl inhibition. Together, our results link the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase to CNDAC-induced DNA damage repair process and provide rationale for CNDAC/sapacitabine combination therapy in diseases such as CML.']",

        "Background":"[\"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) caused by the constitutively activated BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. CML progresses from an initial chronic phase, through an accelerated phase, to a final and fatal blast crisis. Current first-line therapy for CML involves tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinibs. However, TKIs don't completely cure CML, as revealed by low complete molecular response rate and frequent disease relapse upon drug withdrawal. Studies of patient samples and mouse models indicate that this most likely results from lack of dependence of CML stem cells (CML-SCs) on BCR-ABL for survival. It is important to further identify potential targets of CML-SC. Shp2 is a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase involed in RTK, cytokine, and integrine signaling pathways, and is a target of Abl kinase during cell proliferation. It is required for survival and maintenance of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In the context of CML, BCR-ABL constitutively phosphorylates Gab2, which then binds to Shp2, resulting in its inappropriate activation of downstream pathways, including the Ras-Erk cascade. Gab2 is required for CML initiation in vivo. We hypothesized that Shp2 is required for CML development from the stem cell level and might be an effective target for treatment of CML. Using our induced Shp2 deletion tools, we found that Shp2 is required for CML initiation and maintenance in a bone marrow transplant model of CML. Moreover, primitive CML cells undergo elevated cell death upon Shp2 knockout. This implicates Shp2 as a potential target for CML therapy in future.\"]",

Currently, small molecule therapeutics that target the tyrosine kinase domain (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs) are administered as the gold standard treatment for CML. However, evidence shows that the acquisition of mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain against these small molecules is inevitable, rendering many of the therapeutics useless against mutated forms of Bcr-Abl. The most recently discovered TKI, ponatinib (AP24534), has shown to combat nearly all of the commonly seen mutations, including the previously uncontrollable T315I mutation. But, ponatinib is not without limitations, as it has been shown to cause dose-dependent pancreatitis and thrombocytopenia as adverse side effects. While many small molecules have been created to target the tyrosine kinase domain, our recent work has shown that disruption of Bcr-Abl oligomerization can also induce apoptosis and decrease the oncogenic potential of the disease. This work was done using a modified coiled-coil domain, termed CCmut3, which was rationally designed and mutated to bind to the endogenous Bcr-Abl coiled-coil domain, inhibiting oligomerization and thus preventing Bcr-Abl signaling. The purpose of this work is to exploit a dual-hit approach to inhibit Bcr-Abl using two therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. Here, we show that combining CCmut3 with ponatinib not only increases the potency of the therapy but also lowers the required therapeutic dose of ponatinib in vitro using K562 cells (Bcr-Abl-positive, human CML cells). Western blot analysis shows that both Bcr-Abl phosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream signaling targets STAT5 and CrkL can be decreased using the combination at a ponatinib dose of 100 pM. In addition, transformative ability (via colony forming assay) very significantly declines when using a 1 nM dose in combination as opposed to simply administering 1 nM ponatinib only. Finally, caspase 3/7, 7AAD, and DNA segmentation assays were performed to show enhanced apoptosis induction upon combination treatment when compared with either CCmut3 or ponatinib treatment alone. Currently, this combination is being tested in a Bcr-Abl-positive Ba/F3 cell line containing the T315I mutation in the Abl tyrosine kinase domain. Lastly, attempts to truncate and cap the CCmut3 helix to provide stability and more simple therapeutic delivery are underway, in addition to elucidating the individual intracellular mechanisms of action of both CCmut3 and ponatinib.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder of hematopoietic stem cell and is marked by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, a reciprocal translocation occurring between the long arm of chromosome 9 and 22 resulting in the formation of a fusion BCR-ABL1+ oncogene which encodes a constitutively active non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Clinically, the disease progresses through three phases', \" an initial chronic phase, accelerated phase and terminal blast phase, which is marked by increased production of immature myeloid precursor cells. Earlier we have shown that BCR-ABL mediated repression of miR-223 results in the activation of mef2C and ptbp2 in chronic myeloid leukemia. Transcription factor MEF2C, required for cell survival and proliferation, is important for lymphopoiesis, and its ectopic expression in myeloid progenitors antagonizes myelopoiesis. We reported that MEF2C expression increases as the disease progresses from chronic phase to blast phase and by knocking down MEF2C in a CML cell line we showed that it negatively correlates with the CEBPA expression, a granulocytic transcription factor. Imatinib, the drug of choice for CML, abrogates MEF2C expression and reverses CEBPA repression both in the cell line and the primary cells. In the present study we observed that when the cells were treated with anisomycin it degraded MEF2C expression in 16hrs which imatinib can achieve after 24hrs. Investigators have demonstrated that anisomycin acts as a potent signaling agonist, synergizing with growth factors and phorbol esters to superinduce immediate-early genes such as c-fos, fosB, c-jun, JunB, and JunD. However here blocking the MAPK kinases with inhibitors didn't reverse the inhibition suggesting that these pathways may not be involved in the anisomycin mediated MEF2C degradation in CML. Mef2c gene consists of three alternative exons, α1/α2, skipping exon β and 3'splice site ɣ. In order to characterize the role of mef2c gene in CML, first we investigated the different isoforms of mef2c in CML cell line (KCL22) by amplification of the whole mef2c gene and cloning the same in a TOPO vector. Several clones were checked and sequenced. Two different types of isoforms (α1+ β- ɣ+ and α1+ β- ɣ-) were found to coexist in KCL22 cells along with an exclusion of 9 bases (AACACAGGT) from the splice junction of exon 4 and 5, which was not reported earlier. However, K562 cells along with KYO-1 and LAMA-84 showed the presence of 9 bases. Nine base pair deletion was also observed in CML patient samples (both CP and BC). Interestingly sequencing of the mef2C genomic region from the cell lines and the same patient samples showed the presence of 9 bases.

Importantly, there is increasing evidence that deregulation of the JAK or STAT activity plays a critical role in BCR-ABL-induced malignant transformation. SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 are inhibitors of JAK-STAT pathway and as such are involved in a negative feedback loop of cytokine signaling. However, the mechanism by which Abl oncogene bypasses SOCS inhibitory regulation remains poorly defined. Here, we found that co-expression of BCR-ABL with SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of these SOCS proteins. Interestingly, tyrosine-phosphorylated SOCS-1 was detected in three of five primary CML samples which express BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL-dependent phosphorylation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 occurred mainly on Tyr 155 and Tyr 204 residues of SOCS-1, and Tyr 221 residue of SOCS-3. Phosphorylation of these SOCS proteins was associated with its binding to BCR-ABL, and this interaction was disrupted by mutation of the sites of SOCS phosphorylation. We demonstrated that BCR-ABL-dependent phosphorylation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 alters their inhibitory effects on the activation of JAK1 and JAK2 and thereby enhances JAK-STAT signaling. Moreover, disrupting the tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 promotes K562 leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis and blocks tumor formation in mouse model.

        "Background":"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the first blood cancer known to originate from a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) by expression of BCR-ABL, a product of the chromosomal translocation t(9;22), that slowly progress to a lethal fast-growing leukemia caused by malignant reprogramming of progenitor cells (blast crisis). Although CML can be successfully managed with targeted therapy by suppressing BCR-ABL kinase activity with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), patients remain in remission as long as they adhere to a lifelong treatment. The leukemic stem cell (LSC) population emerges as a key CML reservoir that escapes TKI therapy by developing BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of self-renewal and survival. LSC still remains an elusive target because of our poor understanding of specific self-renewal mechanisms and inability to selectively eliminate LSC without damaging normal hematopoiesis. Thus, there is a need for alternative drugs for relapse patients to prevent reactivation of BCR-ABL-positive LSC after stopping chemotherapy or emergence of chemoresistance and as frontline therapy to achieve treatment-free remission. We found that somatic deletion of the transcriptional factor Krppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in BCR-ABL(p210)-induced CML severely impaired disease maintenance. This inability to sustain CML in the absence of KLF4 was caused by attrition of LSCs in bone marrow and the spleen and impaired ability of LSCs to recapitulate leukemia in secondary recipients. This data suggest that KLF4 promotes self-renewal of LSCs whereas serial transplantation indicates that KLF4 restricts stress self-renewal of normal HSCs and thus inhibition of KLF4 function would impair LSC self-renewal without altering blood production. Analyses of global gene expression in purified LSCs and genome-wide binding of KLF4 in a murine CML cell line revealed that KLF4 represses the gene encoding for the dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2). Immunoblots revealed elevated levels of DYRK2 protein in KLF4-deficient LSCs purified from the bone marrow of CML mice. Because phosphorylation of c-Myc and p53 by DYRK2 induces proteosomal degradation and cell death, respectively, we found that DYRK2 upregulation in KLF4-deficient LSCs was associated with a reduction of c-Myc protein and increased cleavage of PARP. As a proof-of-principle of the therapeutic potential of this finding, we explored the efficacy of vitamin K3 to eradicate LSCs by inhibiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase SIAH2 in charge of DYRK2 degradation. Vitamin K3 efficiently reduced cell viability in a panel of human-derived CML cell lines by inducing Dyrk2 expression and apoptosis. The identification of Dyrk2 as a critical mediator of LSC downfall is an innovative paradigm poised to support the development of LSC-specific therapy to induce treatment-free remission in CML patients.']",

Specific and effective drugs targeting the protein products of these gene fusions have been developed and are used in current clinical practice. Molecular diagnostic methods are used for patient identification, for tracking drug effectiveness, and monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD). However, the use of quantitative PCR (qPCR) for this purpose has been problematic, particularly for determination of low limits of detection (LOD) and for comparing results between labs. International standards have been developed to ameliorate these issues, but there are significant ongoing challenges with these efforts. Here we address these challenges through the development of a multiplexed reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay, and provide a direct comparison between samples run using the International Standardized qPCR and the new multiplexed RT-dPCR method.Digital PCR isolates individual single target molecules into compartments for endpoint PCR, with absolute quantification provided by simply counting the number of PCR-positive compartments. Using the RainDrop dPCR system, we partitioned each sample's target RNA molecules into a single-molecule droplet format, together with a one-step reverse transcription master mix (SuperScript III Platinum Taq, LifeTech) and standard qPCR hydrolysis probes/primers (IDT), for endpoint PCR and absolute quantification. We used a 4-plex multiplexed assay that counts 1) the e13\", 'a2 isoform of BCR', 'ABL; 2) the e14', \"a2 isoform of BCR-ABL; 3) GUSB RNA as an endogenous counting control, and; 4) a synthetic RNA as an exogenous control.Initial characterization of the multiplexed assay's specificity and sensitivity were performed using RNA from cell lines (K562 for e14\", 'a2; Invivoscribe clonal cell line for e13', 'a2 and e1', \"a2; U937 for a negative control). Samples derived from blood were split and quantified using either qPCR together with International Standard Protocols and reagents, or using the 4-plex RT-dPCR assay.

Sensitivity assessment based on control generated data provides evidence of detection as low 1 in 200,000 without hitting a detection limit.The use of dPCR provides significant advantages over standard qPCR methods including absolute quantification which eliminates the need for standard curves, the ability to use RNA directly, the use of an exogenous control (non-ABL) and easy isoform analysis.\"]",

        "Background":"['The use of ABL1 kinase inhibitors has dramatically improved the outcome for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. However, resistance after treatment still poses a major clinical challenge. The most common resistance mechanism following treatment with first or second line therapy is the occurrence of a T315I mutation in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1. Only one clinically available ABL1 inhibitor, ponatinib, has been shown to target this gatekeeper mutation, but has recently been associated with significant adverse effects. Hence, there is an unmet need for new and improved therapies for patients with T315I BCR-ABL1 leukemias.In this study we set out to functionally and molecularly profile BCR-ABL1 T315I-driven CML/Ph+ALL patient samples to understand the disease pathogenesis and identify novel therapies with a drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) platform covering 306 approved and investigational oncology compounds. Mononuclear cells isolated from patient bone marrow were plated with drugs on 384-well plates. Each compound was tested for its effect on cell growth and survival in a 10,000-fold concentration range enabling the generation of dose response curves and by comparing to healthy donor mononuclear cells, selective drug sensitivity scores (sDSS).Ex vivo DSRT results of one CML and two Ph+ALL patient samples with the T315I mutation revealed a marked and specific sensitivity (IC50 30-40nM) to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, originally developed as a VEGFR inhibitor. Strikingly, sensitivity to axitinib was higher in these T315I positive patient samples than in T315I negative CML or ALL patient samples or any other leukemic samples. Supporting the notion that axitinib is a direct T315I BCR-ABL1 inhibitor we observed that Ba/F3 cells transformed with T315I BCR-ABL1 were sensitive to axitinib while the same cells transformed with wild type BCR-ABL1 were not. Finally, we discovered that axitinib has been described to have selective binding towards T315I ABL1 compared to the wild type kinase (Kd 1.5 nM vs. 36 nM, respectively, Davis et al. 2011, Nat. Biotechnol. 29', '1046-1051). Based on this information, the T315I CML patient mentioned above was compassionately treated with axitinib for 2 weeks resulting in a rapid 4-fold reduction of the mutated transcript levels in blood suggesting targeted in vivo activity of the drug.In summary, we demonstrated that axitinib is a potent BCR-ABL1 T315I inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. In light to the fact that axitinib is currently approved as a second line therapy for renal cell carcinoma and is well tolerated in patients, there is an opportunity to repurpose axitinib for Ph+ leukemia patients with T315I mutations with significantly shorter clinical development time.']",

Clinical management of CML has been revolutionized by imatinib, a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Imatinib selectivity is due in part to its ability to recognize and stabilize the inactive conformation of the kinase domain. This conformation is stabilized by intramolecular binding of the SH3 domain to theSH2-kinase linker, which in turn packs against the back of the kinase domain. Imatinib resistance can be caused by point mutations that either affect drug binding directly (e.g., through mutation of the gatekeeper position, Thr315) or that allosterically disturb the downregulated kinase domain conformation (e.g., through mutation or phosphorylation of the SH3 domain). These observations suggest that strengthening the regulatory SH3', 'linker interaction present inBcr-Abl may stabilize a downregulated kinase domain conformation, thus sensitizing the kinase domain to inhibitor action. To explore this possibility, we created a series of modified c-Abl and Bcr-Abl proteins with enhancedSH3-linker interactions. By systematically increasing the proline content of the linker, we identified high-affinity linkers that stabilized intramolecularSH3 binding without disturbing the overall regulation of the kinase core.Enhanced SH3', 'linker interaction completely reversed c-Abl core activation by aC-lobe myristate binding pocket mutation, and substantially reduced activation by mutations in the ATP binding site (T315I) as well as the SH2', 'C-lobe interface (Y158D). Remarkably, enhanced SH3', 'linker interaction dramatically sensitized Bcr-Abl not only to imatinib but also to the myristic acid binding pocket inhibitor, GNF-2. These effects were observed in the context of both wild-type and imatinib-resistant forms of Bcr-Abl. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry of recombinant Abl core proteins with high-affinity linkers revealed dynamic coupling between the SH3', 'linker interface, the GNF-2 binding site in the C-lobe myristate binding pocket, and the active site.Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence that regulatorySH3', 'linker interaction is retained in the context of Bcr-Abl, and supports the idea that small molecules enhancing natural regulatory interaction at theSH3', 'linker interface may have utility as chemical sensitizers of Bcr-Abl drug action in the kinase domain.']",

        "Background":"['Despite the clinical success of imatinib in treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), patients who develop resistance to available ABL inhibitors remain a clinical challenge. There is compelling evidence to suggest that the bone marrow microenvironment hinders the efficacy of kinase inhibitors, and may eventually lead to overt resistance. We developed a screen of nearly 300 molecules from the microenvironment to evaluate molecules that protect CML cells from imatinib. This screen identified Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) as a factor that mediates kinase inhibitor resistance in the CML cell line K562. Inhibition of FGFR with the selective inhibitor PD173014 attenuated the protective effects of FGF2, and siRNA revealed that FGF2 promotes survival through activation of FGFR3. FGFR3 was found to subsequently activate Ras and the MAPK pathway to promote K562 survival - despite effective inhibition of BCR-ABL by imatinib. More impressively, addition of FGF2 to K562 cells in long-term cultures with imatinib revealed that FGF2 was reproducibly capable of promoting growth and eventual imatinib-resistance in K562 cells (N=5). In contrast, K562 cells cultured in media alone or with other myeloid growth factors, did not develop resistance to imatinib. Sequencing of the kinase domain in resistant cells did not reveal mutations of the ABL kinase domain as a mechanism of resistance. Inhibition of both FGFR and BCR-ABL in the FGF2 imatinib-resistant outgrowths was synergistic in promoting cell death.To evaluate whether FGF2 may be involved in resistance in CML patients, immunohistochemistry of bone marrow samples from imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib resistant patients revealed increased FGF2 staining compared to normal controls and CML patients at diagnosis, suggesting that FGF2 levels increase over time and promote resistance in vivo. Further evidence that FGFR may be important in kinase resistance is emerging from clinical trials of the novel ABL inhibitor, ponatinib. Although ponatinib was specifically developed to bind BCR-ABL with the T315I mutation, it is also a multi-kinase inhibitor, including inhibition of FGFR in the low nanomolar range. To wit, ponatinib was able to suppress FGF2 imatinib-resistant outgrowths in the low nanomolar range whereas imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib were ineffective, even at high doses. In clinical trials, ponatinib has proven effective not only against T315I mutated BCR-ABL, but also in patients with minor or even no mutations of the ABL kinase domain (in press). This suggests that stimulation of growth pathways by the microenvironment, such as FGF2, may be an important mechanism of resistance in some CML patients. Moreover, our approach provides a method to predict pathways of resistance in leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples. This strategy has the potential to define rational combinations of kinase inhibitors that can circumvent resistance before it is even clinically apparent.']",

Clinical management of CML has been revolutionized by imatinib, a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Despite the clinical success of imatinib in the chronic stage of CML, it is less effective in advanced disease due to the emergence of drug resistance often caused by point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain. Recently, we demonstrated that introduction of the gatekeeper resistance mutation T315I into a recombinant c-Abl core protein enhanced basal kinase activity. Imatinib selectivity is achieved in part by binding and stabilizing the unique inactive conformation of the Abl kinase domain. This conformation is stabilized allosterically by intramolecular binding of the SH3 domain to the SH2-kinase linker, which in turn docks against the back of the kinase domain. The goal of this project, therefore, was to determine whether kinase activation induced by T315I, as well as a mutation in a recently described allosteric inhibitor binding site in the kinase domain C-lobe (A356N mutant), could be overcome by enhancing the SH3', 'linker interaction. For these experiments, we engineered nine High Affinity Linker (HAL) variants of Abl in which SH3', 'linker interaction was tightened through sequential addition of proline residues to the linker. Enhanced SH3', 'linker interaction was confirmed by analysis of SH3 dynamics using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Using cell based assays, we identified Abl-HAL core proteins that remain locked in an inactive conformation. To determine the impact of the HAL sequences on activating mutations in the kinase domain, the strongest HAL sequence was combined with the T315I and A356N mutations. Remarkably, the HAL substitution completely reversed Abl core activation by the A356N mutation, and partially reversed the effect of T315I. We next introduced the HAL sequence into p210 Bcr-Abl coding region (wild-type and T315I), and expressed these forms of Bcr-Abl along with matched controls in the human myeloid cell line, TF-1. The Bcr-Abl HAL mutants transformed TF-1 cells to a cytokine-independent phenotype as effectively as wild-type Bcr-Abl but were much more sensitive to induction of apoptosis by the allosteric inhibitor, GNF-2. Furthermore, TF-1 cells transformed with Bcr-Abl-HAL bearing a wild-type kinase domain also showed greater sensitivity to imatinib and the related inhibitor nilotinib, suggesting that enhanced SH3', 'linker interaction structures the kinase domain in a favorable conformation for drug action. Our results provide new evidence that SH3', 'linker interaction not only has a strong allosteric effect on the regulation of the c-Abl kinase core, but also on Bcr-Abl sensitivity to both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors as well.']",

Overexpression of let-7 can sensitize K562 and KU812 cells to imatinib, while knock-down of let-7 can increase the drug resistance of these cells.

Here, we report on the potential of a novel BiTE antibody targeting CD33 in redirecting autologous T cells for in vitro lysis of blasts from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Initial antibody titration experiments showed that CD33 BiTE concentrations at low picomolar ranges mediate effective lysis of leukemic cell lines. We next analysed primary samples from AML patients, which were co-cultured with mononuclear cells (MNC) from healthy donors in presence or absence of specific BiTE antibodies at an E\", 'T ratio of 1', '1. After 48h of incubation in the presence of 1ng/ml CD33 BiTE we observed a decrease of both CD33+ AML blasts as well as CD33+ monocytes when compared to samples with control BiTE or without BiTE. 1ng/ml CD33 BiTE specifically induced strong upregulation of activation markers CD25 and CD69 on the vast majority of all CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We furthermore investigated whether T cells from AML patients were able to mediate lysis of CD33+ leukemia cells by CD33 BiTE. T cells purified from peripheral blood or bone marrow of newly diagnosed AML patients were tested for BiTE mediated lysis of U-937 target cells. Redirected T cells from AML patients were capable of eliminating leukemic cells in the presence of CD33 BiTE as effectively as T cells from healthy controls. In consequence of this we studied blast lysis and T cell behaviour in a completely autologous setting using cryo-conserved samples from AML patients. Despite strong activation of T cells only moderate lysis of myeloid cells was observed after 48h, possibly due to low E', 'T ratios in these samples. Therefore, to allow autologous T cell expansion, cells were cultured for up to 144h. After this prolonged incubation, CD33 BiTE-mediated redirected lysis of AML blasts and myeloid cells was observed in most but those patient samples that had a very low initial effector-to-target (E', 'T) cell ratio. To adress this problem, we stimulated autologous T cells in a first step by incubating AML samples in presence of 1ng/ml CD33 BiTE for 7 days. After purification of the expanded T cells we performed autologous cultures with high initial E', 'T ratio (1', '1). This led to fast, effective and almost complete lysis of CD33+ target cells.

By contrast only 2/12 AML and 5/14 CLL patients demonstrated anti-phosphopeptide immunity compared to 10/10 HDs (2< 0.01 for both). In contrast immunity against viral and mitogenic stimuli was similar between patients and HDs. Following allogeneic stem cell transplantation the majority (10/12) AML patients reconstituted anti-phosphopeptide immunity. In some cases dramatic expansions, of similar magnitude to cytomegalovirus responses, were observed approaching 1% of CD8 T cells for a single phosphopeptide epitope. In CLL, none of whom were transplanted, we found that over the study period of 12 months that among the patients with anti-phosphopeptide immunity only 1 of 5 patients required treatment compared to 4 of 9 patients requiring treatment where no anti phosphopeptide responses were seen (2=NS). Importantly, ex vivo expanded phosphopeptide specific T cells isolated from both healthy individuals and patients post-transplant were able to kill both HLA-matched primary leukemia samples and AML cell lines in a phosphopeptide-specific manner. These data suggest a prominent role for tumor-associated phosphopeptide antigens in the prevention and control of haematolymphoid disease in man.']",

But An area of skin cancer has not been yet investigated. The aim of this study was to explore the role of the Skp2 in Imatinib antitumor effect on human skin cancer. To explore Imatinib effect on growth of A431 cells (squamous cell carcinoma / skin cancer) we conducted CCK8 assay and Flow cytometry. Western blot assay was performed for determining the functions and molecular mechanism of Imatinib in A431 cells. we found that Imatinib significantly inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, we observed that depletion of Skp2 triggered cell cycle arrest and colony formation inhibition by Imatinib. Mechanistically we identified that Imatinib markedly downregulated Skp2 protein expression and subsequently upregulated p21 expression via increased protein stability. In conclusion, Imatinib exerts its antitumor activity via inhibition of Skp2 - p21 axis and these findings suggest that targeting Skp2 by Imatinib could be promising therapeutic approach for Squamous cell carcinoma therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Molecularly targeted therapies have been exceptionally successful in the treatment of some malignancies, most notably chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However in other cancers, e.g. Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), drug resistance is a frequent occurrence. Resistance mutations may pre-exist as a consequence of intra-tumor heterogeneity; thus the extent of heterogeneity may determine the likelihood of treatment failure. Intra-tumor heterogeneity is challenging to quantitate, as heterogeneous mutations are likely to occur below the background error rate of conventional approaches for mutation detection. To overcome this limitation and explore the relationship between intra-tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance in Ph+ leukemias, we utilized single-molecule Duplex Sequencing (DS) of the ABL1 gene. DS eliminates sequencing errors by independently tagging the two strands of individual DNA molecules; true mutations are present at the same position in both strands, while PCR and sequencing errors are only present in one strand. DS has an error rate below 0.00001%, and thus enables quantitation of heterogeneous mutations with unprecedented resolution. We find that CP-CML, a disease that is often well controlled with targeted therapy, has an extremely low burden of intra-tumor heterogeneity at the time of diagnosis, with a sub-clonal mutation burden similar to that of normal individuals. Simulations which take into account the low cancer stem cell fraction of CP-CML and the sub-clonal mutation burden we measured reveal that only a minority of CP-CML patients will harbor pre-existing drug resistance, which may explain the unusual success of targeted therapy in this setting. Next, we studied patients with advanced Ph+ leukemias (refractory BP-CML and Ph+ ALL), which have a high rate of treatment failure and poor outcomes. We find that patients with BP-CML and Ph+ALL have a significant elevation in sub-clonal heterogeneity relative to those with CP-CML. We demonstrate that the higher extent of intra-tumor heterogeneity correlates with a significantly higher rate of drug resistance mutations and compound resistance (i.e. two concurrent resistance mutations) in patients. Unlike CP-CML, pre-existing mutations conferring resistance to targeted therapy are nearly certain in refractory BP-CML and Ph+ ALL as a consequence of the load of intra-tumor heterogeneity and high cancer stem cell fraction. We support this concept by three distinct approaches', ' (i) detection of pre-existing sub-clones that drive treatment failure; (ii) modeling the growth kinetics of resistant clones; and (iii) extrapolation of the mutation burden measured by DS. Our results suggest that intra-tumor heterogeneity influences the likelihood of resistance to molecularly targeted therapy. Quantitation of sub-clonal mutation load may be broadly applicable in other malignancies for predicting the likelihood of response to targeted therapy and monitoring disease progression.']",

Increased EGFR activation by ligand administration rescued cells from dasatinib-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of EGFR enhanced its apoptotic effect. Estrogen receptor (ER) was demonstrated to play a role in bcl-2 expression, and dasatinib inhibited ER at pre-translational level. ER worked in concert with EGFR to regulate dasatinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, xenograft model showed that dasatinib inhibited HSC3 tumor growth through in vivo down-regulation of EGFR and ER.

        "Background":"['Autophagy plays a critical role in cancer formation and therapeutic resistance. However, little is known about how autophagy is regulated in cancer and how it mediates therapeutic resistance. Here we elect to use chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as a cancer model to study autophagy in that it is driven by a single onco-protein BCR-ABL, whose activity can be selectively blocked by imatinib a front-line treatment for CML. Moreover, imatinib resistance frequently occurs in CML patients. Thus, unraveling autophagy regulation in CML and its role in overcoming imatinib resistance has substantial therapeutic benefits not only for CML but also for other cancers that can be treated by imatinib. In this report, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference screen in K562 human CML cells using monodansylcadaverine (MDC) that marks autolysosomes followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to label and isolate autophagic cells. We have identified 336 candidate genes, knockdown of which significantly increased MDC fluorescence. Our further validation utilized Cyto-IDTM Green dye that selectively stains autophagy vacuoles and quantitative RT-PCR that measures knockdown efficiency of shRNAs. We have uncovered a set of genes acting as autophagy mediators in K562 cells. To study their role in imatinib resistance, we measured the effect of imatinib in combination with the knocking down of autophagy mediators. Our results showed that the shRNA of VAMP7, a pivotal factor in vesicle transportation, substantially sensitized K562 cells to imatinib. Intriguingly, our further work revealed that depletion of VAMP7 blocked the activity of key autophagy suppressors AKT and mTOR, suggesting that VAMP7 and perhaps other autophagy mediators regulate imatinib sensitivity through signaling pathways that inhibit autophagy. In conclusion, a set of genes revealed by a genome-wide RNA interference screen mediates autophagy in CML cells and, more importantly, some of these genes render CML cells resistant to imatinib thereby becoming appealing drug targets.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is invariably associated with the expression of the p210 Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Although the Abl-encoded tyrosine kinase activity is important for leukemogenesis, the emerging problems of acquired resistance and minimal residual disease highlight the need for new complementary targets for pharmacological intervention. In our previous studies, we had identified a non-classical ubiquitin binding domain (UBD) within the NH2-terminal of p210 Bcr-Abl. Deletion of the UBD (p210 Bcr-Abl(UBD)) impairs the interaction between p210 Bcr-Abl and p--catenin (ser33). Over-expression of p210 Bcr-Abl, but not p210 Bcr-Abl(UBD), leads to an accumulation of phosphorylated -catenin, and at least two of its known transcriptional targets, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. The interaction between p210 Bcr-Abl and -catenin is ubiquitination dependent. -catenin is a central component of the Wnt pathway which plays a critical role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model for CML, mice transplanted with hematopoietic cells that express p210 Bcr-Abl(UBD) have significantly increased life spans compared to mice transplanted with p210 Bcr-Abl expressing cells. Delayed disease progression is associated with decreased levels of -catenin, and reduced numbers of granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs), in the bone marrow. Deletion of UBD also impairs the transplantability of CML cells. Based on these observations we propose a model in which p210 Bcr-Abl may influence the Wnt signaling pathway, and leukemic expansion, by binding ubiquitinated -catenin, and stabilizing it against degradation. Stabilized -catenin leads to increased self-renewal of CML stem cells and progenitors. Importantly, this activity is contained within Bcr sequences, and is independent of tyrosine kinase activity.']",

It has become the main approach to elucidate the transcriptomic landscape in leukemia. However, the knowledge about the advantages and disadvantages of RNA-seq in clinical decision-making and the suitability of mainstream RNA-seq library preparation methods for leukemia research are still in their infancy. Here, we have generated and sequenced polyadenylation selection (PA) and ribo-depletion (RD) RNA-seq libraries from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient samples and compared their fusion-gene, differential expression and related pathways and variant discovery abilities.Our analysis demonstrated that the RD protocol provided, on average, 5% more uniquely mapped reads than the PA protocol (81.5% of reads). Overall, 60%, 35%, and 3% of the reads in the RD libraries mapped to exonic, intronic, and intergenic regions, respectively. The corresponding numbers in the PA libraries were 76%, 21%, 3%, suggesting that PA captures more mature RNAs than the RD preparation and provides a higher read coverage for exon regions. The RD preparation was also marginally better in removing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) than the PA protocol. Regarding transcript quantification, both RD and PA produced fairly equivalent measures of RNA abundance. The patient-matched PA and RD libraries showed a high correlation (r = 0.96) that was slightly less than that seen between technical replicates (r = 0.98) but slightly more than that seen between library-matched sample from patients with the same disease (r = 0.93), indicating that inter-patient variance is the main source of variance in RNA-seq studies. Interestingly, based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using known leukemia gene signatures or gene targets of 17 clinically used drugs in AML and ALL treatment, the PA is more optimal than the RD method for disease classification (area under curve 0.69 vs. 0.65) and personalized cancer therapy guidance (AUC of 0.73 vs, 0.71). Finally, both methods equally detected known fusion genes, which were supported with high number of reads on fusionjunctions. However, in the case of lowly expressed fusion transcripts, only the RD method was able to detect fusions.In conclusion, both protocols produced consistence measures and were of similar usability. However, RD preparation captured more transcriptomic features and was more suitable for fusion-gene discovery, which may be of clinical relevance for sub-typing leukemia patients. The PA method on the other hand had higher overall sensitivity and specificity in gene expression analyses and was, based on our results, more suitable than RD for clinical classification and drug treatment guidance.']",

        "Background":"['Imatinib is a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor and the most used drug in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). MYC (c-Myc) is a transcription factor frequently deregulated in human cancer that exerts multiple biological activities, including differentiation inhibition. We found that MYC expression is higher in bone marrow cells form CML patients at diagnosis, as compared with healthy controls. Moreover, high MYC levels at diagnosis correlated with a poorer response to imatinib treatment. One of the major characteristics of CML progression is the loss of cell differentiation. We showed that low concentrations of imatinib induce erythroid differentiation in the CML-derived K562 cell line. We have studied the effect of MYC on the differentiation induced by imatinib using K562 sublines carrying inducible (by zinc cation) or activable (by 4-hydoxy-tamoxifen) MYC alleles. In both cell lines, MYC largely prevented the erythroid differentiation induced by imatinib. The differentiation inhibition mediated by MYC is not due to increased proliferation of MYC-expressing cells or enhanced apoptosis of differentiated cells in the presence of MYC. We previously reported that p27/Kip1 (p27) overexpression induces erythroid differentiation in K562. Thus, we explored the effect of imatinib on p27 levels and we found that imatinib up-regulated p27 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated silencing of p27 antagonized the erythroid differentiation induced by imatinib, indicating that p27 up-regulation is at least in part responsible for differentiation. MYC abrogated the imatinib-induced up-regulation of p27KIP1 concomitantly with the differentiation inhibition, suggesting that MYC inhibits imatinib-mediated differentiation of K562 cells by antagonizing p27 up-regulation. We previously reported that MYC induced SKP2, a component of the ubiquitin ligase complex that targets p27 for degradation. MYC was able to induce SKP2 in the presence of imatinib. Thus, MYC-mediated inhibition of the differentiating effect of imatinib in CML cells is in part a consequence of the SKP2 induction of MYC, which in turn would down-regulate p27. The results suggest that, although MYC deregulation does not directly confer resistance to imatinib, it might be a factor that contributes to progression of CML through the inhibition of differentiation.']",

We recently showed that TRAIL is able to target leukemia stem cell surrogates (Blood 2012,119,4224). Here we tested the ability of TRAIL to target cell cycle arrested tumor cells.Primary tumor cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were amplified in immuno-compromised mice and used for in vitro knockdown studies, besides tumor cell lines. Cell cycle arrest was induced in G0, G1 or G2 using cytotoxic drugs, phase-specific inhibitors or RNA interference against cyclinB and E. Cell cycle was visualized by flowcytometry analysis including phosphorylation of Serine 10 in Histone H3 to discriminate G2 from M phase.Biochemical or molecular arrest at any point of the cell cycle increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis, independently from the tumor cell type, the cell cycle inhibitor used or the check point addressed. In contrast, when cell cycle arrest was disabled by addition of caffeine, the anti-tumor activity of TRAIL was reduced. Most importantly for clinical translation, tumor cells from three children with B-precursor or T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis upon knockdown of either cyclinB or cyclinE arresting the cell cycle in G2 or G1, respectively.Taken together and in contrast to most conventional cytotoxic drugs, TRAIL exerts enhanced anti-tumor activity against cell cycle arrested tumor cells.

Recently, we observed that dasatinib induces a rapid (within one hour after oral administration) and marked mobilization of lymphocytes (up to 8-fold increase in lymphocyte count), which closely follows the drug plasma concentration. In addition, in a subgroup of patients a clonal expansion of large granular lymphocytes occurs, which is correlated with good therapy response.As dasatinib-induced immunomodulatory effects are not leukemia specific, we aimed to exploit this activity to slow down or inhibit the growth of a syngeneic murine melanoma model and to characterize in detail the anti-tumor immune responses.Ovalbumin expressing murine melanoma cell line B16.OVA was grown under the skin of immunocompetent mice. The mice (n=6/group) were treated daily i.g. either with 30 mg/kg dasatinib or vehicle only. Blood was collected before tumor transplantation, before treatment, and on treatment days 4, 7 and 10. Tumor volumes were measured manually and specific growth rate was calculated based on the first and the last day of the treatment. In addition to white blood cell differential counts, immunophenotyping of blood and tumor homogenate was done by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD45.1, CD3, CD4, CD8b and NK1.1, and SIINFEKL-pentamer to detect B16.OVA-specific cells. To assess the functional properties of lymphocytes, we used antibodies against immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA-4 and PD-1, and a degranulation marker CD107.On the 10th day of treatment, the tumor volumes were smaller in dasatinib group compared to control group, and there was a significant decrease in the tumor growth rate (0.06 vs. 0.18, p=0.01). Furthermore, dasatinib treated mice had increased proportion of CD8+ cells in the circulation (21% vs. 14%, p=0.04) and the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly decreased (1.39 vs. 1.52, p= 0.04). During the tumor growth the mean CTLA-4 expression on CD8+ cells increased from 1.2% to 9% in the control group, whereas, in dasatinib group the increase was more modest (1.2% to 5.7%). Interestingly, 80% of tumor infiltrating CD8+ cells expressed PD1 antigen compared to <5% of PD1 positive CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood suggesting lymphocyte anergy or exhaustion induced by tumor cells.To conclude, dasatinib treatment slowed down the tumor growth in B16.OVA mouse model, which could be associated with the immunomodulatory effects of dasatinib.

We have previously shown that adipocytes protect acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells against DNR in vitro and that media cultured by both adipocytes and ALL cells together (ALCM) can protect ALL cells from DNR. We hypothesize that this protection is in part mediated by adipocytes alleviating oxidative stress in ALL cells.Murine pre-B ALL cells isolated from a BCR/ABL transgenic mouse (8093) and human leukemia cell lines (BV173, Nalm6, REH, SEM, RS4;11, HL60, and Molt4) were used.

Intracellular ROS was measured by flow cytometry with 2-7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH-DA). Four of the six human leukemia cell lines tested were protected by adipocytes against DNR treatment. Western blots showed that DNR induced a significant increase in the cleaved to procaspase-3 ratio, which was reversed by ALCM (No drug', ' 0.240.2, DNR', ' 0.830.14, ALCM+DNR', ' 0.240.19; p = 0.004 for DNR vs. ALCM+DNR, n = 4). Expression of the oxidative stress response genes gclc, gclm and p21 was upregulated in 8093 cells upon DNR treatment (fold change over baseline', ' 1.820.37, 2.350.73, 5.551.50; p<0.05, n = 3), while the presence of adipocytes prevented this upregulation (fold change over baseline', ' 0.830.11, 0.880.02, 1.750.57; p<0.05, n = 3). To investigate the oxidative stress induced by DNR, Nalm6 cells were treated with five doses of DNR for 6 hours alone or in the presence of pre-adipocytes or adipocytes. There was a dose-dependent increase in%ROShigh cells regardless of feeder type. At 200nM DNR, there were significantly fewer%ROShigh cells when co-cultured with adipocytes compared to no feeder or pre-adipocytes (p<0.05, n = 3). To test whether alleviating oxidative stress alone would cause DNR resistance, BV173, Nalm6 and REH cells were treated with DNR (100, 200 and 300nM, respectively) or a combination of DNR and the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; 20mM). The addition of NAC significantly protected the cells from DNR (p<0.05, n = 3).These findings demonstrate that adipocytes contribute to drug resistance by alleviating oxidative stress in ALL cells. Further research is required to identify the soluble factors responsible for these protective effects.']",

        "Background":"['The extent of heterogeneity in DNA sequence within human cancers has been difficult to fully assess, due to the absence of methods with sufficient sensitivity to detect minority variants. For example, next-generation sequencing could in principle detect sub-clonal mutations at any genomic position; however due to amplification errors and inaccuracies in the sequencing platform itself, such approaches are limited to detection of mutations present in >1% of cells. We have overcome this limitation by developing an approach, Duplex Sequencing, which improves the accuracy of next-generation sequencing by >100,000 fold. Duplex Sequencing is based upon separately tagging and sequencing the two strands of single molecules of duplex DNA. True mutations are present at the same position in both DNA strands and are complementary, whereas artifacts arising from amplification or sequencing errors are seen in only one strand. The calculated error rate of our approach is less than one artifactual mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced (ref. 1). We have also developed an enrichment approach based on sequential rounds of hybridization to biotinylated probes which enables efficient sequencing of targeted regions of the genome (ref. 2). Duplex Sequencing thereby enables exceptionally sensitive detection of sequence heterogeneity within any set of genes. We have now applied Duplex Sequencing to study of sequence heterogeneity in both normal and malignant samples. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we find multiple sub-clonal mutations which fall below the detection limit of conventional approaches, some of which encode mutations that can drive chemotherapy resistance and cancer progression. Our results indicate that prior studies have under-estimated the burden of sub-clonal mutations in AML by more than 1,000-fold. We have additionally studied chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); treatment of CML with inhibitors directed against the Abl kinase represents the prototypical targeted cancer therapy. With Duplex Sequencing, we find that Abl mutations are extremely uncommon at the time of CML diagnosis. In contrast, refractory patients who fail therapy frequently possess multiple sub-clonal mutations within the Abl kinase, most of which are below the resolution of conventional approaches but are readily detected with our method. In ongoing work, we have found multiple sub-clonal mutations within human prostate cancer and colon cancer, suggestive of widespread intratumor heterogeneity that may limit the efficacy of single-agent therapy in these diseases.References', '1.

This assumes great significance as we move into the era of treatment free remission. Methods', ' A total of 31 EDTA-blood samples of CML patients with known values ranging from 0.003-0.5 IS were processed via an accredited RTPCR protocol calibrated to the IS scale and a parallel dPCR workflow without any specific calibration .

This approach required no specific calibrators or standards and resulted in extremely cost effective testing. This freedom from routine calibration provides for a significantly more robust workflow and greatly increased reliability. Limitations do persist in dPCR on account of limited chip densities which are the main parameter for the Poisson statistics. This has limited the dynamic range on dPCR to a maximum of Log 4 for accurate quantification. However as chip densities and emulsion concentrations increase in these technologies, they are poised to introduce a new era in the quest of accurate quantification.']",

Since then, they have become valuable therapeutic targets and several inhibitors are currently used in the clinic. For example, the BCR-ABL inhibitor nilotinib is currently used for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here we show that this antileukemic drug also inhibits invasive properties of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Inhibition was observed at the same dose-range for growth inhibition of CML cells. Nilotinib also strongly reduced liver metastasis induced by injection of CRC cells in the spleen of nude mice. Since we could not detect Abl deregulation in CRC cells, we speculated the involvement of an alternative target to be identified. Interestingly, a previous chemical-proteomic approach identified DDR1 as a novel target of nilotinib (Rix et al, Blood, 2007). DDR1 is a poorly-characterized TK and a receptor for collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix. Accordingly, we found that DDR1 catalytic activity regulates cell invasion and metastasis of CRC cells. In addition, we demonstrate that nilotinib pharmacological activity is mediated by the inhibition of DDR1 in CRC cells', ' expression of the nilotinib resistant DDR1/T701I mutant renders CRC cells resistant to nilotinib treatment. Finally, we found that DDR1 catalytic activity is significantly increased in metastatic nodules compared to the primary tumor and the healthy tissue of the same patient.

Previously, dysregulated activity of transcription factors due to mutation e.g. Myc or overexpression e.g. Sox11 has been shown to perturb B cell differentiation leading to malignant phenotypes, resistance to chemotherapeutics and genetic heterogeneity. Zhx2 is required for normal neuronal and erythropoietic differentiation and has been identified as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, analysis of public databases shows that Zhx2 is highly overexpressed in several cell lines representing B cell malignancies including B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and B cell lymphoma. Consistently, Zhx2 is also overexpressed in patient samples derived from different subtypes of B cell malignancies. Quantification of Zhx2 mRNA expression obtained from human donors showed a marked upregulation during transition from common lymphoid progenitor to Pro B-cell stage suggesting potential role in B cell differentiation. Here we report that Zhx2 is overexpressed in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) B-ALL and T-ALL cell lines as well as Ph- B-ALL cell line. Zhx2 silencing in BV-173 (Ph+ B-ALL) and CMLT1 (Ph+ T-ALL) showed enhanced apoptosis with low doses of Dasatinib, a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor.

Both of these transcription factors have roles in B cell differentiation, survival, proliferation and are commonly deregulated in B cell malignancies.

Furthermore, HDACIs are known to potentiate tyrosine kinase lethality in such cells. The goal of the present studies was to determine whether PLK1 inhibitors (e.g. BI2536) and HDACIs interacted synergistically in BCR/ABL+ cells sensitive or resistant to imatinib mesylate in vitro and in vivo and if so, to identify the mechanism(s) underlying this interaction. ExperimentalDesign', ' K562 and LAMA84 cells, IM-resistant Adult-T315I and BV173/E255K cells, and primary CML cells were exposed to BI2536 with or without vorinostat (Merck) for various intervals.

K562 and BV173/E255K cells were used to test the in vivo efficacy of this drug regimen in animal models.Results', ' Co-treatment with BI2536 and vorinostat synergistically induced cell death in parental or IM-resistant BCR/ABL+ cells and primary CD34+ bone marrow cells but was minimally toxic to normal cells. BI2536/vorinostat co-treatment triggered pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, PARP cleavage, ROS generation, and DNA damage (manifested by increased expression of H2A.X, p-ATM, p-ATR), all of which were significantly attenuated by the anti-oxidant TBAP. Combined treatment had little effect on T210 phosphorylation of PLK1, but clearly reduced S137 phospho-PLK1 without changing PLK1 expression. While the agents alone had little effect on BCR/ABL phosphorylation, combined treatment induced modest reductions in phospho-BCR/ABL but not total expression. Exposure of cells to BI2536 alone induced marked G2M arrest, whereas vorinostat co-administration abrogated this effect. PLK1 shRNA knockdown significantly increased HDACI lethality, whereas HDAC 1-3 shRNA knockdown reciprocally increased BI2536-induced apoptosis. Genetic interruption of the DNA damage linker H1.2 partially but significantly reduced PLK1/HDAC inhibitor-mediated cell death, arguing for a functional role for DNA damage in lethality. Finally, BI2536/vorinostat co-treatment dramatically reduced tumor growth in both subcutaneous and systemic BCR/ABL+ leukemia xenograft models (including those resistant to IM), and significantly enhanced animal survival. Notably, the regimen was highly effective in a late stage tumor model which is classically resistant to most therapeutic interventions.Conclusions', ' These findings suggest that concomitant PLK1 and HDAC inhibition is active against IM-sensitive or refractory CML cells both in vitro and in vivo, and that this strategy warrants further evaluation in the setting of BCR/ABL+ leukemias.']",

Clinical studies have shown that children who are obese at the time of ALL diagnosis have a greater risk of relapse than normal weight children; however, this risk may be attenuated if their weight normalizes over the majority of treatment. One possible explanation is that nutrient-deficiency may induce host, but not ALL, cell senescence, thereby augmenting chemotherapy specificity and efficacy. Here, we hypothesize that a calorie- and fat-restricted diet during chemotherapy differentially alters host and ALL cell metabolism, improving chemotherapy efficacy and overall survival of high-fat diet-induced obese mice with ALL.To test the effect of dietary restriction on survival, C57BL/6J mice were placed on a high-fat diet (60% calories from fat) upon weaning. At 20 weeks of age, obese and control mice were implanted with syngeneic BCR/ABL+ ALL cells. After a 7-day latency, half of the obese mice were switched onto a low-fat (10% calories from fat) diet. Concurrently, vincristine chemotherapy (0.5mg/kg/wk x 4wks) was initiated and mice were tracked for survival. Separate groups of implanted mice were sacrificed 1 day before, 1 day and 1 week after dietary restriction for bone marrow and spleen collection. BrdU incorporation and p-AKT(Ser 473), p-eIF2A(Ser51) and p-S6K(Thr412) levels in marrow and spleen ALL and host cells were analyzed via flow cytometry for changes in cell cycle and metabolism. Finally, we also evaluated the effect of dietary restriction on human ALL outcome, using an obese xenograft ALL model treated with vincristine, dexamethasone and L-asparaginase.Dieted obese C57BL/6J leukemic mice exhibited a greater percentage of weight loss over the first two weeks of chemotherapy compared to non-dieted obese mice (Dieted vs. non-dieted obese', ' -25.210.6% vs. -0.34.5%, p<0.001).

Flow cytometry of the murine bone marrow and spleen showed no diet-induced alterations in BrdU incorporation or AKT pathway activation in either host or ALL cells. Surprisingly, however, we did not observe a similar effect of dietary restriction on survival in the obese xenograft ALL model.Based on these findings, a calorie and fat restricted diet initiated at the onset chemotherapy improves overall survival in obese mice with syngeneic ALL, though this phenomenon was not observed in a human xenograft model. Further work is needed to explore the possibility of a dietary intervention as an effective potential adjuvant during chemotherapy in obese cancer patients.']",

Presence of activating mutations, gene fusions or copy number amplification of many of these kinases predict responsiveness to specific inhibitors, for example, imatinib for BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, trastuzumab and lapatinib for ERBB2-amplified breast cancers, gefitinib for lung cancers with kinase domain mutations in EGFR, and crizotinib for lung cancers with ALK gene fusions.

To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data from a compendium of 482 cancer and benign samples belonging to 25 different tissue types to define sample-specific kinome expression profiles. Comparing the expression of kinases within a sample and across sample sets, we identified distinct outlier kinases in individual samples, defined as genes showing the highest statistically significant levels of absolute and differential expression. Frequently observed outlier kinases included known therapeutic targets like ERBB2 and FGFR4 in breast cancer, distinct from MET, AKT2, and PLK2 in pancreatic cancer. Outlier kinases imparted sample-specific dependencies in various cell lines as assessed by siRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Outlier expression of polo-like kinases (PLKs) observed in a subset of KRAS-dependent pancreatic cancer cell lines conferred increased sensitivity to the PLK inhibitor BI 6727. Together, our results suggest that outlier kinases represent effective personalized therapeutic targets that are readily identifiable through RNA-sequencing of tumors.

However, the functional relevance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their in vivo regulation during Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis remain unknown, although recent studies have shown that aberrant expression of lncRNAs is associated with various human cancers. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in human CML cells using an lncRNA cDNA microarray, and identified an lncRNA termed lncRNA-BGL3 that acted as a key regulator of Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. Notably, we observed that lncRNA-BGL3 was highly induced in response to disruption of Bcr-Abl expression or by inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase activity in K562 cells and leukemic cells derived from CML patients. Ectopic expression of lncRNA-BGL3 sensitized leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis and inhibited Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing lncRNA-BGL3 were generated. We found that transgenic expression of lncRNA-BGL3 alone in mice was sufficient to impair primary bone marrow transformation by Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, we identified that lncRNA-BGL3 was a target of miR-17, miR-93, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a and miR-106b, microRNAs that repress mRNA of PTEN. Further experiments demonstrated that lncRNA-BGL3 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for binding these microRNAs to cross-regulate PTEN expression. Additionally, our experiments have begun to address the mechanism of how lncRNA-BGL3 is regulated in the leukemic cells and showed that Bcr-Abl repressed lncRNA-BGL3 expression through c-Myc-dependent DNA methylation. Taken together, these results reveal that Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation critically requires silence of tumor suppressor lncRNA-BGL3 and suggest a potential strategy for the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia.']",

        "Background":"['The tumor suppressor 2A (PP2A) is a multi-enzyme complex that targets a variety of oncogenic signaling cascades such as Raf, MEK and AKT. Numerous reports have now emerged indicating that the inhibition of PP2A leads to the development of tumors including breast, gastric and lung and a range of hematological malignancies such as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML and AML, respectively). We and others have shown that inhibition of PP2A is crucial for the oncogenic effects of leukemia associated receptor tyrosine kinases such as BCR/Abl, c-KIT and FLT3. Importantly when PP2A is reactivated using pharmacological agents (FTY720 and AAL(S)), growth and survival of these cells is inhibited. This approach targets molecules downstream of these oncogenic kinases and thus PP2A reactivation is designed to avoid resistance associated with kinase inhibitor therapy. As the mechanism of action of these PP2A activators is unknown, it is essential that we now determine the molecular targets of these compounds to generate more effective drugs. Using a chemical proteomics approach incorporating click chemistry linking the drugs to beads, unbiased pull down assays were performed in myeloid leukaemia cells and protein isolates were identified by mass spectrometry. Using this approach we have identified a novel cellular target, which is known to be overexpressed in a range of cancers, including leukemias. We have also shown that this protein associates with PP2A complexes in these cells, and thus may act as an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A activity. We have also performed phospho-proteomics and co-immunoprecipitation studies to identify protein changes in myeloid leukemia cells in response to PP2A activators. In addition to identifying known PP2A targets, such as Akt and ERK, we have also identified a number of novel protein changes, including altered expression of the SET oncoprotein. SET is a known inhibitor of PP2A, suggesting that FTY720 may act via inhibition of SET. Other PP2A regulatory proteins such as CIP2A, PME-1 and PP2A-B56alpha are also affected by FTY720/AAL(S) treatment. Our research findings are thus providing the vital clues necessary for determining the mechanism of action of clinically relevant PP2A activators, thereby moving us towards the provision of novel anti-cancer treatment regimes.']",

        "Background":"['IntroductionThe adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of RNA editases has been linked to the pathogenesis of diverse malignancies, including leukemia, breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. We previously showed that human leukemia stem cells (LSC) from blast crisis (BC) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients harbor increased ADAR1 expression compared with normal and chronic phase (CP) progenitors. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed increased adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing during CML progression concentrated within primate specific Alu-containing transcripts. However, detection of RNA editing by RNA-Seq in rare cell populations can be technically challenging, costly and requires PCR validation. Thus, the objectives of this study were to validate RNA editing of a subset of these LSC-associated transcripts in the context of lentivirally enforced ADAR1 expression, and to develop an RNA editing reporter reporter assay in human leukemia cells and a qPCR-based diagnostic test to rapidly detect CSC-associated aberrant RNA editing.MethodsThe BCR-ABL+ human leukemia cell line K562 was stably transduced with lentiviral human ADAR1 or vector. FACS-purified K562-ADAR1 cells were transfected with a luciferase-based reporter vector to confirm RNA editing activity. Two genes, MDM2 and APOBEC3D, were selected from our previous RNA-Seq studies of BC progenitors (Jiang et al, 2013). Targeted sequencing was performed on high fidelity PCR products using primers flanking each of 2 editing sites in each gene. RNA editing-specific qPCR primers were designed for each editing site using an allele-specific strategy that detects cDNA containing either an A or G(I) representing an RNA editing event. Both targeted sequencing and qPCR were used to detect RNA editing in K562-ADAR1 and primary cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) lentivirally transduced with ADAR1.ResultsLentivirally enforced ADAR1 expression promoted RNA editing activity as measured by luciferase reporter activity. Increased A-to-I changes in MDM2 and APOBEC3D were confirmed by targeted sequencing. In independent experiments, RNA editing site-specific qRT-PCR accurately detected RNA editing in K562-ADAR1 cells (n=3) and in primary HSC overexpressing ADAR1 (n=4). Site-specific primers distinguished G(I) bases at RNA editing sites in cDNA and as predicted gave no signal in gDNA. Relative A-to-I RNA editing ratios were increased by 2 to 3 fold in ADAR1-expressing cells at all four sites.ConclusionsThese results set the stage for development of primate-specific RNA editing as a novel diagnostic strategy for clinical LSC detection and identify ADAR1 as a potential therapeutic target in LSC. These data shed new light on the mechanisms of ADAR1-mediated generation of malignant progenitors that drive therapeutic resistance, disease progression and relapse in CML and may be applicable to other CSC-driven malignancies.']",

        "Background":"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable accumulation of malignant B-cells in peripheral circulation, which home to supportive leukemic microenvironments. Critical to the pathogenesis of CLL are membrane-associated antigens since they facilitate leukemic cell signaling, microenvironment homing, proliferation, and survival. Targeting these CLL surface molecules is a current focus of CLL therapeutic development. Rituximab, alemtuzumab, and ofatumumab are commonly used antibody-based therapeutics that proved to be effective at targeting CLL membrane associated antigens. Despite enhanced patient survival, targeting of non-obligate antigens ultimately leads to antibody resistance. In addition, off target expression often produces unacceptable toxicity. Immunosurveilance antigens may provide a key to overcome these obstacles. A number of relevant tumor antigens such as p53, EGFR, WT1, BCR-Abl and ROR1 elicit robust autoimmune responses in cancer patients due to high levels of ectopic expression, high relative immunogenicity and obligate oncogenic signaling that forces expression despite autoimmune recognition. In many cases, autoantibody signatures were realized long after identification of the oncologic target antigens; however, the convergence of these two datasets implies that such signatures could be utilized to identify novel targets. To further explore this possibility, we interrogated anti-tumor humoral reactivity specifically directed against autologous CLL membrane antigens. Immunoreactive leads were identified by mass spectrometry. Potential membrane antigens were further confirmed using immunoblot and ELISA. Our analysis revealed Lymphocyte Cytosolic Protein 1 (LCP1), a membrane associated lymphocyte-specific target that is constitutively expressed on CLL and ectopically expressed in various cancers. Confirmatory assays unveiled robust LCP1-specific IgG autoimmune responses in CLL patients despite a profound absence of reactivity to common viral and vaccine antigens. LCP1 plays a critical role in B-cell biology by cross linking f-actin filaments, thereby solidifying cytoskeletal structures and providing a scaffold for CLL-critical signaling pathways such as PKC. Transwell assays confirmed that LCP1 activity contributed to the migration of CLL cells towards CXCL12. We further utilize a novel xenograft model to demonstrate LCP1 involvement in CLL pathogenesis. We have also characterized LCP1 expression within cancer derived exosomes revealing a previously unknown function of this gene. Our data reveals that LCP1 is a novel membrane associated target antigen in CLL with evidence of differential immune response as compared to common vaccine antigens. We also demonstrate that LCP1 plays a role in CLL microenvironment signaling and progression.']",

However, TKI are ineffective for late-stage or blast crisis (BC) CML in which phase, granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) have acquired the ability to function as leukemic stem cells (LSCs), and are thought to act as a reservoir for TKI resistance with poor prognosis. An effective BC-CML therapy will likely have to target the BC-LSC population to ensure long-term disease control.Recent studies have shown the importance of the MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase (MNK1/2)-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) axis in sustaining BC-LSC self-renewal. Thus, a single agent which inhibits both BCR-ABL and MNK1/2 kinase simultaneously represents a rational approach to target BC-LSCs. Such an agent should be able to distinguish between normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and LSCs.Here, we report the discovery of a potential BC-CML therapy that relies on the inhibition of MNK1/2 and BCR-ABL kinases using a dual specific MNK/ABL inhibitor. We will also report the in vitro and in vivo biological data, pharmacokinetic properties, and biochemical characteristics of such compounds.

However, it is still unknown how BCR-ABL over-expressed cells can maintain such altered redox status, while escaping from the persistent oxidative stress-induced cell damage or apoptosis. Therefore elucidation of the mechanisms by which CML cells cope with oxidative stress will provide important insights into the molecular events leading to leukemia development and drug resistance. The major goals of this study are to investigate the role of BCR-ABL-regulated downstream cell survival factors in providing an adaptive mechanism which allows CML cells to survive in the presence of cellular oxidative stress, and to evaluate the potential therapeutic implications. Several experimental models were used to test the cellular redox status and relative sensitivity of oxidative stress-induced cell death in our study, including BCR-ABL inducible cell lines, BCR-ABL stably transformed cell lines and BCR-ABL-expressing CML blast crisis cells with different BCL-XL/BCL-2 patterns. Additionally, we established an artificial CML cell model with heterogenic BCL-XL/BCL-2 expression to assess the correlation between cell survival factor genetic background and cell sensitivity to Imatinib and oxidative stress. In this study, BCL-XL has been identified as the major survival factors responsive to BCR-ABL-promoted cellular oxidative stress and plays a dominant role in regulating the threshold of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The cell survival factors BCL-XL and BCL-2 differentially protect mitochondrial integrity under oxidative stress. BCL-XL is an essential survival factor in maintaining viability of the cells with the excessive ROS while BCL-2 seems to play a relatively minor role. In addition, combination of redox-modulating reagent -phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) with BCL-XL/BCL2 inhibitor ABT737 or suppression of BCL-XL expression by BCR-ABL inhibitor Gleevec dramatically sensitizes CML cell to ROS stress-induced apoptosis.

        "Background":"['Alterations in translation are associated with various human malignancies, but the precise pathogenic processes and mechanistic underpinnings remain to be better understood. The oncogenic tyrosin kinase Bcr-Abl, which is believed to induce chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), could cause the dysregulation of mRNA translation initiation by activating a series of signal pathways. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), a critical element in the assembly of translation initiation complex, has been shown to anticipate in Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis. eIF4B is activated through Ser422 phosphorylation by several pathways including JAK/STAT/Pim and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Such redundant activation provides mechanistic bases for the less potent antitumor consequences under single-pathway targeted therapy. Interestingly, profound synergy was observed against cell survival and tumor growth and greater decrease of eIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation was detected upon the combination of Pim and mTOR inhibitors. Knockdown of eIF4B would increase the dependence of Bcr-Abl positive cells on Pim and mTOR signaling and then sensitize cells to the synergistical effect mediated by the combined inhibition. In addition, inhibiting mTOR pathway by shRNA targeting AKT or mTOR renders cells dependent on Pim pathway and knockdown Pim1 would sensitize cells to mTOR inhibitor. Thus, eIF4B acts as a prominent role in Bcr-Abl-driven pathogenesis by playing as the convergent point of these pathways which are active in Bcr-Abl positive tumors. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Bcr-Abl-induced cellular transformation can be blokced and provides a rationale for combination therapy targeting the dysregulation of translation for CML.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['The fusion protein Bcr-Abl responsible for the oncogenic activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) depends heavily on oligomerization for function. Formation of Bcr-Abl oligomers occurs through a coiled-coil domain existing at the N-terminal portion of the Bcr segment. Previously, we have shown that disruption of this oligomerization utilizing a modified coiled-coil domain (CCmut2) both decreases the proliferation of CML cells and results in the induction of apoptosis. An important contributing factor to these results stems from the increased destabilization of CCmut2 homo-dimers. This phenomenon occurs due to the rationally mutated residues in the modified coiled-coil which allow for favorable interactions with the wild-type Bcr-Abl, but destabilizing interactions with other CCmut2 molecules, thus discouraging the formation of CCmut2 homo-dimers. In turn, this increases the availability and affinity for the modified coiled-coil to interact with and inhibit endogenous Bcr-Abl in CML cells. An additional mutation (K39E) was included that could potentially further destabilize the mutant homo-dimer. Added to the other mutations found in CCmut2 (C38A, S41R, L45N, E48R, Q60E), the new construct was termed CCmut3. To show that CCmut3 results in enhanced binding to a wild-type coiled-coil domain (representative of endogenous Bcr-Abl), 2 separate assays were performed. Colocalization studies were used to show the degree to which CCmut3 localizes intracellularly with Bcr-Abl. Additionally, a mammalian two-hybrid assay was conducted to show the relative selective dimerization between CCmut3 and the Bcr-Abl coiled-coil. Next, caspase 3/7 assays were performed and showed the ability of CCmut3 to induce apoptosis. The CCmut 3 also showed nuclear segmentation (a measurement of late-stage apoptosis) and decrease in oncogenic proliferation (via the colony forming assay). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for using CCmut3 as a therapeutic for CML. Lastly, attempts to truncate the CCmut3 to find the smallest possible sequence needed (e.g., helix 2) to bind and kill cells effectively is currently underway.']",

        "Background":"['B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by actively dividing B-lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and bone marrow, associated with the accumulation of quiescent lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of affected patients. Current treatments for this disease include chemotherapeutic (chlorambucil (CLB), cyclophosphamide, fludarabine) and immunotherapeutic agents (Rituximab, Alemtuzumab) or the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapeutics drugs. In 2008, the FDA approved bendamustine, a bifunctional agent with a nitrogen mustard moiety and a purine analog, for the treatment of patients with CLL. Signals from the bone marrow and lymph node microenvironments protect CLL lymphocytes from drug-induced apoptosis. During treatment the enzyme-mediated repair of DNA damage can induce resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. We have previously shown that small molecule inhibitors of c-abl (a key protein of the homologous recombinational repair pathway) such as imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib, sensitize primary CLL lymphocytes to CLB. We also demonstrated that ZRF4, a combi-molecule designed to target c-abl (through an imatinib moiety) and to induce DNA damage (through a nitrogen mustard moiety), has a more potent cytotoxic effect than the combination of CLB plus imatinib in CLL lymphocytes. Here we report the anticancer effect of three different combi-molecules composed of a chlorambucil moiety and a dasatinib (a dual Src/c-abl inhibitor) moiety compare to the individual components in primary CLL lymphocytes in-vitro. Using MTT assays on CLL lymphocytes from 40 CLL patients, we found that the IC50 (concentration which kills 50% of the cells) of AL748, AL758 and AL816 are significantly lower than the IC50 of CLB when used alone and the combination of CLB with 0.1 M dasatinib (median value = 1.7 M, 0.6 M, 0.9 M, 11 M and 3.1 M respectively). Moreover, our biochemical results suggest that the mechanism of action of AL758, AL816, CLB and CLB plus dasatinib share common downstream targets including inhibition of Src kinase, chemotaxis, and cross-talk with the microenvironment along with induction of DNA damage (p53, p21, comet assay) and apoptosis (AnnexinV, cleaved caspase-3). We also determined, by the MTT assay, the cytotoxic effect of the combi-molecule AL887 composed of a bendamustine moiety and a dasatinib moiety, compare to the individual components in vitro in primary B-lymphocytes from 20 CLL patients. Our results demonstrated that this combi-molecule has a better anticancer activity than bendamustine in combination with 0.1 M dasatinib (p<0.0005).Dose-limiting toxicity and drug pharmacokinetics are important and limiting factors to take into account for the development of chemotherapy and will be tested in a CLL mouse model. Our results suggest that the combi-molecules AL758, AL816, and AL887 may be useful alternatives for treatment of CLL patients.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Outcomes in adult Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ALL) remain poor with a 5 year overall survival of less than 40%. Addition of the targeted BCR-ABL inhibitors (TKI) to standard cytotoxic therapy has greatly improved upfront treatment, yet relapse remains common with a median survival of just 4.5 months. Therefore identification of targeted agents that could enhance the activity of TKIs is urgently needed. ABT 199 is a BCL-2 inhibitor which has shown pre-clinical activity against a variety of B cell malignancies. Here we evaluate the combination of ABT199 across a panel of TKIs to explore potential mechanisms of synergy in hopes to better define the optimal combination for future clinical studies.  Methods', '  Drug efficacy in vitro was determined using the Ph+ALL cell line SupB15. Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib or ponatinib in combination with ABT199 for 72 hours. Cell viability was assessed using a colorimetric MTS assay, and cell apoptosis was assessed with annexin V staining. Combination effects were calculated using Calculsyn software. Standard immunoblots were used to assess inhibition of downstream pathways.  Results', '  The combination index (CI) values for each of the TKIs with ABT199 ranged between 0.13  1.4 for Imatinib, 0.4  1.05 for Nilotinib, 0.06  0.33 for Ponatinib, and 0.07  0.64 for Dasatinib, where CI < 1 predicted synergy. As a single agent, ABT199 induced the highest degree of apoptosis, enhanced preferentially by dasatinib and ponatinib. Evaluation of key phosphorylated kinases showed that all four TKIs effectively inhibited the downstream ABL1 target pCRKL. In addition, both dasatinib and ponatinib inhibited pLYN while dasatinib also inhibited pBTK.  Conclusions', '  Combination of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL targeting in Ph+ALL is synergistic in vitro. The enhanced synergy seen with dasatinib and ponatinib may be due to the ability of these agents to target additional pathways active in leukemic cells. The addition of ABT-199 as part of TKI therapy for adult Ph+ALL warrants further clinical investigation, particularly in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.']",

        "Background":"['Leukemia stem cells (LSC) play a crucial role in initiation, maintenance, and progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Targeted therapy with a BCR-ABL targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.g. dasatinib) has improved survival of patients with chronic phase CML. However, like blast crisis (BC) CML, survival remains only 30% over 5 years, and treatment frequently fails to eliminate dormant LSC that are hypothesized to drive CML relapse. Overexpression of BCL2 family genes has been observed in human BC CML and may fuel LSC survival. Our previous data demonstrated that pro-survival long isoforms of BCL2 and MCL1 were preferentially expressed in BC CML LSC compared to normal stem cells. These data showed that the bone marrow (BM) is enriched for BCL2 and MCL1-expressing LSC and serves as a reservoir for therapeutic resistance, thereby underscoring the importance of pan-BCL2 inhibition in the BM. A potent pan-BCL2 inhibitor, sabutoclax, has been identified that inhibits the binding of BH3 peptides to Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bfl1-1 at nanomolar concentrations.To demonstrate whether sabutoclax or the combination of sabutoclax and dasatinib could synergize to eradicate LSC in the BM, humanized BC CML LSC mouse models were established by using 50,000 CD34+ cells selected from primary BC CML patient samples and transplanted into neonatal RAG2-/-c-/- mice. Mice were screened for peripheral blood (PB) engraftment of human cells at 6 weeks, randomized, and dosed with (1) vehicle, (2) sabutoclax (10mg/kg, i.v., twice a week for 2 weeks), (3) dasatinib (50mg/kg, p.o., daily for 2 weeks), or (4) combination. Mice were sacrificed one day after last dose; PB, spleen (SP) and BM were collected for FACS analysis to measure engraftment and cell cycle status of LSC in different hematopoietic niches. BCL2 and MCL1 expression was measured in BM and SP by isoform specific qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Treatment of CML LSC-transplanted mice with sabutoclax alone led to a significant reduction in LSC burden in the SP, but only slightly in the BM. Meanwhile, Single agent sabutoclax reduced the engraftment of quiescent LSC. The effect of sabutoclax synergized with dasatinib to further reduce LSC burden in the BM to eradicate LSC that drive therapeutic resistance. Importantly, these treatments spare normal human stem cells in both BM and SP thereby providing in vivo evidence of a reasonable therapeutic index. Sabutoclax not only reduced the expression of BCL2 and MCL1 mRNA long isoform in the BM, but also significantly reduced the number of human CD34+, BCL2+ and MCL1+ cells in both BM and SP. These results demonstrate that BM and SP niche BC CML LSC survival is driven by overexpression of multiple pro-survival BCL2 family isoforms rendering them susceptible to a novel pan-BCL2 inhibitor, sabutoclax, at doses that spare normal hematopoietic progenitors.']",

        "Background":"['Although targeting the BCR-ABL kinase with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is effective in chronic phase (CP) CML, targeting BCR-ABL alone is not sufficient to treat late-stage or blast crisis (BC) CML. In BC CML, granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) acquire the ability to function as leukemic stem cells (LSCs), and are thought to act as a reservoir for TKI resistance. While long-term remission in BC CML is possible with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, only a minority of patients are eligible for transplantation, and may experience high morbidity and mortality. Safe and effective BC CML therapy will likely have to target the BC LSC population to ensure long-term disease control.Recent studies have shown the importance of the MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase (MNK1/2)-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) axis in sustaining BC LSC self renewal. Thus, a single agent which inhibits both BCR-ABL and MNK1/2 kinase simultaneously represents a rational approach to target BC LSCs. Such an agent should be able to distinguish between normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and LSCs.Here, we report the discovery, structure activity relationships, pharmacokinetic properties, and biochemical characteristics of dual MNK1/2 and BCR-ABL inhibitors, ETC-027 and ETC-219. These compounds are able to prevent eIF4E phosphorylation, BCR-ABL-driven growth and proliferation of BC CML cells, as well as inhibit the MNK-eIF4E-dependent self-renewal function of BC LSCs, while leaving normal HSCs untouched.']",
