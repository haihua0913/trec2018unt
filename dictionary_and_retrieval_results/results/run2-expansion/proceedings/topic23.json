        "Meeting_name":" Revisiting the mechanisms of PTEN loss in melanoma",
        "Background":"['IntroductionInactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor, a negative regulator of oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling, occurs in a subset of melanomas and is correlated with disease progression, treatment resistance and reduced patient survival. PTEN loss of function in melanoma is thought to result largely from gene deletion, mutation and/or methylation. However, the low frequency of these genomic alterations cannot explain the higher rate of loss of PTEN protein expression that is observed in melanoma. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that loss of PTEN expression in melanoma might be the consequence of predominantly non-genomic mechanisms, including post-transcriptional and post-translational dysregulation. Specifically, we postulated that PTEN loss in some melanomas might result from aberrant expression of PTENP1, a PTEN pseudogene-derived long non-coding RNA, and from increased PTEN ubiquitination and hence protein degradation.Experimental ProceduresWe performed an integrated analysis of data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 276) and metastatic melanoma human specimens from patients enrolled at NYU (n = 48). We examined the frequency of PTEN copy number loss using genomic qPCR, PTEN mutations using targeted sequencing and qPCR mutation arrays, and PTEN methylation status was determined in tumors lacking PTEN deletion or mutation with bisulfite treatment and pyrosequencing. Furthermore, we assessed PTEN and PTENP1 expression in tumor samples by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.ResultsComplete PTEN deletions were found in 8% of TCGA cases and in 10% of NYU cases, while partial PTEN deletions were detected in 27% of NYU cases. Somatic PTEN mutations were found in 8% of TCGA cases and 3% of NYU cases. The frequency of PTEN methylation at five CpG islands ranged between 0% and 28% and did not predict PTEN protein expression, thus identifying a subset of tumors that exhibit PTEN protein loss despite a lack of detectable PTEN deletions, mutations or methylation. Integration of PTEN and PTENP1 expression data from TCGA and the NYU cohort revealed a strong positive correlation between PTEN and PTENP1 levels in melanoma. Analysis of a role for aberrant PTEN ubiquitination in promoting PTEN loss in melanoma is ongoing.ConclusionsOur data challenge the existing model in which PTEN loss in melanoma is thought to occur primarily as a result of gene deletion, mutation or methylation. Rather, we find that these are uncommon events in melanoma and that PTEN loss may instead be attributed to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms, such as dysregulation by loss of the PTENP1 long non-coding RNA. A comprehensive understanding of these non-genomic processes could identify novel approaches (PTEN-restoring therapy) to block tumor progression and improve treatment responses and patient survival, suggesting that suppression of PTEN levels in melanoma might be reversible and thus could be exploited clinically.']",

Tumor regression at multiple metastatic sites occurred within 2 months. A single pre-existing metastasis increased in size and was resected at 9 months. IHC, whole exome/transcriptome sequencing, and neoantigen analysis was performed on primary pretreatment (preRx) and treatment-resistant tumors (postRx). Results', ' Responsive tumor sites revealed complete pathologic response at time of surgery. Progressive tumor demonstrated viable ULMS. IHC showed tumor cells negative for PD-L1 and positive for PD-L2 both preRx and postRx. Degree of PD-1+ lymphocyte infiltration decreased significantly postRx compared to preRx. PreRx harbored exomic focal MYC amplification, TP53 nonsense mutation, and heterozygous PTEN deletion. PostRx maintained these genomic alterations and acquired a loss-of-function mutation in PTEN that resulted in biallelic PTEN inactivation. PreRx tumor expressed tumor-specific neoantigens (TSNs) that were immunogenic to patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells; expression of TSNs decreased postRx.

        "Meeting_name":" Clinical assessment of PTEN mutation in FFPE tissue",
        "Background":"['Background', ' PTEN is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the PI3K signaling pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3, converting it to PIP2. PTEN loss of function results in activation of Akt and downstream signaling pathways, and has been associated with numerous cancers, most commonly endometrial cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma and prostate cancer. PTEN loss can be a result of multiple different aberrations which include mutations in the coding region leading to frame-shift or stop codons, genomic deletions as well as promoter methylation leading to loss of PTEN protein. Determination of PTEN status, both at the DNA and protein levels, may be important for clinical decision-making because loss of PTEN is associated with resistance to various targeted therapies, while inactivating mutations may confer sensitivity to therapeutics targeting PI3K pathway members. We have developed Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) assays to assess PTEN mutation status in a set of FFPE patient specimens.Methods', ' Our Sanger sequencing assay for PTEN was developed to detect known hotspot mutations in exons 5-8, which occur in the majority of PTEN mutations reported in the COSMIC database. The IHC and CISH assays were developed using commercially available reagents. All assays were validated using a combination of plasmids, cell lines and FFPE tissues for specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility and concordance.Results', ' 22 patient FFPE tissue specimens from a variety of tumor types including colon, lung, pancreas, uterus and prostate were evaluated for PTEN mutation and expression status by both Sanger sequencing and IHC methods. Sequencing results were', ' 9 wild-type, 12 heterozygous mutant, and 1 hemizygous mutant. 7 of the 9 specimens reported as wild-type by sequencing exhibited normal protein expression levels by IHC, while 2 were PTEN negative by IHC, suggesting that mechanisms other than mutations in exons 5-8 contributed to the loss of expression of PTEN protein. These 2 specimens were further analyzed by CISH to determine copy number. Of the 13 specimens reported as mutant by sequencing, IHC protein expression results indicated that 6 were PTEN positive and 7 were PTEN negative, underscoring the observation that exon 5-8 mutation status alone is not sufficient to predict PTEN expression levels. Data on CISH analysis of the specimen that was hemizygous mutant by sequencing will be reported to confirm the copy loss.Conclusion', ' The data suggest that additional mutations outside the exon 5-8 region as well as promoter methylation may result in loss of PTEN protein, and that accurate clinical assessment of PTEN mutation and protein expression status in FFPE tissues requires complimentary methods including Sanger sequencing, IHC and CISH methodologies.']",

Exhausted T cells are characterized by', ' 1) an over expression of inhibitory receptors or exhaustion markers such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and Tim-3; 2) a loss of function (cytotoxicity, cytokine production and proliferation); 3) a down-regulation of cytokine receptors, rendering them refractory to cytokine stimulation; and 4) changes in transcription factors, including downregulation of T-bet expression. T cell exhaustion has been extensively studied in the context of chronic infectious diseases and different types of cancer, however little is known about exhaustion of NK cells in the same background. NK cells, innate immune cells that eliminate tumors through cytotoxicity and IFN- production, have a key role in immune surveillance of tumors, including melanoma. In this study, we characterize and compare the phenotype of NK cells from patients with melanoma of different stages (I, II, III, IV) and healthy donors.METHODS', ' We compared NK cells from 10 patients with melanoma at each stage of presentation (I, II, III, IV) and from 20 healthy donors as it relates to membrane expression of activating (NKG2D and NKp46) and inhibitory receptors (KIRB1 and KIRNKAT2), function (cytotoxicity, IFN- production and proliferation) and the intracellular expression of the transcription factor T-bet. NK cells cytotoxicity was measured by Lamp-1 expression using K562 cells as target cells. IFN- production was measured after 4h stimulation with rhIL-12. Proliferation was quantified by CFSE after 6 days in the presence of rhIL-2.RESULTS', ' As the stage of the melanoma advanced we observed a pattern of gradual increase of inhibitory receptors (with a higher difference between stage II and stage III) and a concomitant decrease of activating receptors (with a higher difference between stage III and stage IV). With regard to the three most important NK cell functions, IFN- production and proliferation were impaired beginning with stage I and advancing to stage IV, while cytotoxicity was reduced only at stage III and stage IV. Similarly, T-bet expression also began to decrease at stage III.CONCLUSIONS', ' These data suggest that NK cells from melanoma patients gradually develop a phenotypic and functional profile consistent with exhaustion, beginning with stage I and advancing to stage IV. The exhaustion phenotype begins with initial loss of IFN- production and proliferation ability, and finally cytotoxicity. Therefore, the concept that NK cells also become exhausted make them an interesting population to target therapeutically. Furthermore, as the exhaustion phenotype is acquired progressively through the stages, and not exclusive to stage IV, it may be possible to intervene early in the course of tumor progression.']",

        "Background":"['Vascularization of tumors promotes not only their survival and growth, but also facilitates metastases from primary to distant sites. For that reason, understanding the molecular determinants controlling tumor angiogenesis is mandatory to develop clinically efficacious angiogenesis inhibitors for cancer therapy. Melanoma differentiation associated gene or mda-9, also known as syntenin, is a multifunctional scaffold protein that cross talks with a plethora of proteins and regulates diverse physiological and pathological processes, including tumor progression and metastasis. Since, tumor angiogenesis promotes metastasis, we hypothesized that in addition to augmenting invasion and migration, MDA-9/Syntenin might also promote angiogenesis thereby facilitating tumor progression and metastasis.Genetic (gain-of-function and loss-of-function) and pharmacological approaches were employed to modify mda-9/syntenin expression in normal immortal melanocytes, early radial growth phase melanoma and metastatic melanoma cells. The consequence of modifying mda-9/syntenin expression on angiogenesis was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo assays, including tube formation assays using human vascular endothelial cells, chicken choriallantoic membrane assays (CAM assays) and xenograft tumor animal models.Employing both genetic and chemical approaches we now demonstrate that MDA-9/Syntenin expression correlates with in vitro and in vivo (tumorigenic/metastatic) transformed/invasive phenotypes of human melanoma. Additionally, our immunohistochemical and in vivo CAM assays confirm that angiogenesis is an essential component of MDA-9/Syntenin-induced tumor progression. To define how MDA-9/Syntenin regulates angiogenesis we identified and analyzed several potential downstream gene targets of MDA-9/Syntenin. One gene implicated in induction of vasculogenesis is insulin growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which is transcriptionally regulated by hypoxia inducible factor-1 as a consequence of MDA-9/Syntenin and Src interaction. IGFBP-2 transcriptionally regulates VEGF-A in an AKT-dependent manner through interaction with V3 integrin resulting in angiogenesis.Our studies delineate an unanticipated cell non-autonomous function of MDA-9/Syntenin in the context of angiogenesis by augmenting expression of several pro-angiogenic factors including IGFBP-2, which may provide a complementary way to promote metastasis. As a result, targeting MDA-9/syntenin or its downstream-regulated molecules may provide a means of simultaneously impeding metastasis by both directly inhibiting tumor cell transformed properties (autonomous) and indirectly by blocking angiogenesis (non-autonomous).']",

Functional genomic screens in cancer cells to discover new therapeutic targets are usually carried out in vitro where interaction with the immune system is absent. Here we report a pooled, loss-of-function genetic screening approach using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing that is conducted in vivo in mouse transplantable tumors treated with vaccination and PD-1 checkpoint blockade. We tested 2,400 genes expressed by melanoma cells for those that synergize with or cause resistance to checkpoint blockade, and recovered the known immune evasion molecules, PD-L1 and CD47. Loss of function of multiple genes required to sense interferon-y caused resistance to immunotherapy. Deletion of Ptpn2, a pleotropic protein tyrosine phosphatase improved response to immunotherapy. In vivo, Ptpn2 deficient tumors showed increased infiltration of activated CD8+T cells. In vitro, Ptpn2 loss by tumor cells increased antigen presentation to T cells. Biochemical, transcriptional and genetic epistasis experiments demonstrated that loss of function of Ptpn2 sensitizes tumors to immunotherapy by enhancing interferon-y-mediated effects on the tumor cell. Thus, augmenting interferon-y signaling in tumor cells could increase the efficacy of immunotherapy. More generally, in vivo genetic screens in tumor models can identify new immunotherapy targets and rationally prioritize combination therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Our interest in the natural product sulforaphane (SF) began with studies of patients at high risk for melanoma. Germline loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the highly polymorphic melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R), confers a 4-fold increased risk for melanoma. Much of this increase arises from the loss of MC1R-mediated upregulation of antioxidant, pigment synthesis, DNA repair and anti-apoptotic pathways that protect epidermal melanocytes from the mutagenic effects of UV radiation. We have found that SF (likely due to its antioxidant activity) protects both normal human melanocytes, and the skin of human subjects with LOF MC1R mutations, from the harmful effects of UV light. Shave biopsies were harvested from donors with either wild-type MC1R or two LOF alleles. The epidermal tissues were treated ex vivo with UV and/or SF then analyzed histologically and by qPCR. Our results showed that SF provides significant protection from UV to both melanocytes and skin. We found also that the antioxidant protein thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1) was significantly induced by SF. In order to explore the role of TR1 in protecting melanocytes from UV-induced damage, we have created a human melanocyte cell line that expresses a micro RNA which targets TR1. These cells display increased sensitivity to the effects of UV and differential processing of the pigment synthesis protein tyrosinase. This study demonstrates the promise of SF as an agent for protection of human skin in individuals with high-risk MC1R genotypes from the effects of UV light, and highlights the role of TR1 in this process.']",

        "Background":"['Background and Aim', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are an abundant class of short (17 to 25 nt) non-coding single-stranded RNAs that are significant controllers of cellular gene expression. Mature miRNA is created from long primary genomic transcripts (pri-miRNA), which are processed in the nucleus. The resulting 60-80-nucleotide precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are transferred to the cytoplasm and are treated to produce a short RNA duplex. One strand of the duplex is degraded, the remaining single-stranded miRNA molecule associates with members of the Argonaute protein family, to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC plus the guide miRNA bind to the 3untranslated region (3-UTR) of the targeted mRNA and induce gene down-regulation by mRNA cleavage or translational repression. Serum stimulation of cancer cells has been shown to prompt positive regulatory transcription factors, such as c-Jun, c-Fos and Egr-1, as well as increasing transcriptional repressors such as YY1, NAB2 and GCF2. These transcription factors play critical parts in the early stimulation of cancer disease phenotypes and are prime targets for clarifying disease pathways and as therapeutic candidates. The identification of microRNAs regulating the mRNAs of transcription factors will improve our understanding of the mechanism of disease gene stimulation and subsequent pathway initiation leading to cancer disease phenotypes.

To address this question, we compiled an shRNA library for chromatin modifying enzymes, chromatin remodelers, and many other factors associated with chromatin regulation. Using this library, we performed a loss of function genetic screen in colon cancer cell lines sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. We identified SIRT2, a NAD+ dependent deacetylase, as a modulator of the response to EGFR inhibitors in colon and lung cancer. Mechanistically, loss of SIRT2 expression enhanced MEK acetylation, resulting in increased ERK activity. Conversely, overexpression of SIRT2 led to reduced phospho ERK and inhibition of growth. SIRT2 loss also conferred resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma and KRAS mutant colon cancers, respectively.

We have built a rule-base network model of the biochemical network regulating immune mediated cell senescence in melanomas, which carry a BRAFV600 mutation in the MAPK signaling network. Using computational methods we have characterized the crosstalk with cytokine signaling networks and the crosstalk with other growth signaling networks. The development of such a computational model may help researchers understand how BRAFV600 cells in melanomas communicate with their environment by secreting various cytokines and growth factors, as it has become clear that this immune secretory phenotype can have pro- as well as anti-tumorigenic effects.By combining rule-based descriptions of the biochemical reactions associated to this phenotype with computer simulation we can open up new avenues for exploring such complex networks linked to melanoma progression.\"]",

Methods', ' Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on 374 advanced solid tumor samples. Targeted sequencing was performed on 562 cancer associated genes, and analysis of matched tumor-normal DNA was performed to filter out germline variants and identify true somatic mutations.

Results', ' Our analysis revealed that 13% (48/374) of tumors were significantly mutated, exhibiting 17 or greater nonsynonymous mutations occurring in a wide variety of solid tumors including but not limited to lung, CRC and melanoma. Over 90% of mutations were either frameshift, missense or splice site alterations, which may result in tumor-specific neoantigens and increased amounts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Loss of function mutations in MMR genes indicative of MMR deficiency which has been associated with increased response to immune checkpoint blockade were present in 21% (10/48) of SM cases.

A comparison of tumors between evolutionarily distant organisms such as humans and fish offers a particularly powerful method to identify such core functionalities. In the past several years, the zebrafish has emerged as an important vertebrate model of cancer because it develops tumors that are histologically and functionally similar to the human disease. Overexpression of the BRAFV600E oncogene under the melanocyte-specific mitf promoter leads to a 100% penetrant melanoma in the context of p53 loss of function. We have previously shown that these zebrafish tumors exhibit characteristics of neural crest progenitors, rather than differentiated melanocytes, similar to many human melanomas which also overexpress the neural crest markers sox10 and ednrb. To identify the genomic lesions that are common to both species, we are performing RNA and DNA-sequencing of the zebrafish tumors and comparing them to human melanoma resequencing samples to identify common driver events. To facilitate this, we have developed technologies for both short and long term culture of zebrafish melanoma cell lines, along with normal tissue from each individual animal. One such melanoma line, ZMEL1, has been comprehensively characterized. RNA-seq demonstrated upregulation of neural crest genes such as ednrb, and pathway analysis indicated enrichment for ERK/MAP kinase and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, and these tumors are sensitive to inhibition by the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on tumor cell line and matched normal tissue to a depth of 39X coverage on the Illumina platform. A total of 5193 single basepair mutations were identified, of which 2% were found in the coding region, 41% in intronic regions and 56% in the intergenic DNA. Within the coding region, 25% were G>C and 18% T>C substitutions, with approximately equal number of non-synonymous to silent mutations. Coding mutations in several genes such as rps6kb1b and plb1 are of particular interest because of their reported mutation in human cancer as well. 35 regions of copy number changes were found, comprising over 600 genes, and these include amplification of known oncogenes such as SETDB1. Functional analysis of the genomic changes common to both zebrafish and human tumors is now being undertaken using in vitro and in vivo melanoma models. In summary, comparative oncogenomics between zebrafish and human melanoma provides a powerful method for filtering the vast number of changes down to a list of manageable, testable hypotheses.

        "Background":"['Cancer metastasis is a complex process that culminates in the majority of patient deaths. A key component of the cancer paradigm involves cancer stem cells (CSCs), the primary mediators of cancer progression, resistance to therapy and recurrence of cancer after remission/latency. Although the clinical significance of CSCs is well accepted, the key upstream regulatory mechanisms that define these unique subsets of cancer cells requires further clarification. Previous studies demonstrate that MDA-9/Syntenin or syndecan binding protein (SDCBP) levels are elevated in large spectrum of tumors, including melanoma, breast carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), versus normal cellular counterparts. We now uncover a unique function of MDA-9 as a facilitator of cancer stemness and survival.Expression profiles of mda-9, Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-myc were studied in different clinical samples and cell lines for correlations. Cells were sorted by FACS into stem and non-stem populations and the same genes were assayed for correlative expression. Stemness gene expression array profile analysis was performed on control and mda-9 silenced CSCs. Genetic (gain-of-function, loss-of-function) approaches were used to modify mda-9 expression in normal human astrocytes and prostate cells, non-stem cancer cells (NSCCs) and CSCs from breast prostate and GBM. Recovery-of-function approaches were also applied to elucidate the pathways responsible for MDA-9-mediated regulation of CSCs. The impact of MDA-9 on CSC-mediated tumorigenicity and progression was evaluated in vivo by intracranial glioma and subcutaneous xenograft mice models. Apoptosis was assayed by caspase activation and Annexin V staining.A positive and statistically significant correlation was observed between mda-9 and stemness regulating genes (Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-myc), in 50 clinical samples and 3 cell culture systems, including breast, prostate and GBM. CSCs expressed elevated levels of mda-9 vs. non-stem cancer cells or normal stem cells from a total of 11 cell lines including breast, prostate and GBM and two clinical GBM samples. Over-expression of mda-9 in NSCCs increased populations of CSCs as well as expression of stemness regulating genes. Loss of MDA-9 affected 84 genes linked to CSC regulation. Control intracranial glioma xenograft mouse models had large tumors with spongioblastic morphology typical of human gliomas, whereas the loss of mda-9 caused a large decrease in tumor size. Mechanistically, MDA-9 regulated multiple stemness genes and knockdown of MDA-9 caused a loss of stemness and tumorigenicity with initiation of apoptosis.Our data uncover a previously unidentified relationship between MDA-9 and CSCs. CSCs appear more dependent on MDA-9 expression than normal stem cells. MDA-9 regulates CSCs on multiple levels of stemness and survival, reinforcing the relevance of this gene as a potential therapeutic target.']",

        "Background":"['Cancer cells utilize amino acids to satisfy their need for nutrients and fuel their accelerated growth. The amino acid glutamine has been identified as one of the key building blocks in cancer cells, utilized for macromolecular synthesis and energy production. Due to the increased requirement for glutamine and other amino acids, cancer cells commonly increase expression of amino acid transporters, such as SLC1A5 (ASCT2). Amino acid transporters are membrane transport proteins that are used by cells to move important amino acids in and out of the cell. Interestingly, most amino acid transporters are upregulated in cancer to ensure continued access to nutrients.We have recently shown that ASCT2 plays a critical role in regulating glutamine uptake in melanoma, prostate and breast cancer. Many other glutamine transporters are upregulated in different cancers, including SLC38 family members SNAT1, SNAT2 and SNAT3. The role of SLC38A4 (SNAT4) in amino acid uptake and cancer growth, however, has not been examined. Like the other SNATs, SNAT4 is a sodium-dependent amino acid transporter that transports neutral amino acids, such as alanine, across the plasma membrane, although it has low affinity for glutamine. Interestingly, unlike the other SNAT family members, our analysis showed that SNAT4 expression is downregulated in 879/917 cancer cell lines in Oncomine. Analysis of SNAT4 mutations in patient samples using cBioPortal showed infrequent mutations in the majority of cancers. However, the TCGA melanoma data (cBioPortal) showed that 32 of 278 melanoma cases (11.5%) have a point mutation in SNAT4 suggesting an important role in melanoma. These mutations included 9 SNAT4 hotspot mutations, present in 2-4 patients each. Using a SNAT4 homology model to predict loss-of-function mutants, we selected five of these mutations to assess in a SNAT4 transport assay in Xenopus oocytes. Two of the five hotspot mutations (G31E, S76F, G78E, G150E and S371F) were able to completely inactivate SNAT4 alanine transport in oocytes. Further analysis of 52 melanoma patient samples in Oncomine showed SNAT4 downregulation in all patients, suggesting that, in contrast to most amino acid transporters, SNAT4 plays a tumor suppressor role in melanoma.We are currently examining these mutations in melanoma cell lines to determine their effects on cell growth. We are also examining how SNAT4 is involved in either the import or export of amino acids and the downstream metabolic consequences that may directly inhibit melanoma cell growth. Through this research we will gain a better understanding of the role of SNAT4- mediated amino acid metabolism in preventing melanoma cell growth.']",

KRAS encodes two splice variant products—KRAS-4A and KRAS-4B—differing in their C-terminus through alternative fourth coding exons. Though KRAS-4A is homologous to the original transforming transcript identified in Kirsten rat sarcoma virus, its role in human cancer is less characterized compared to KRAS-4B. Here, through genetic analyses of three cohorts of patients with hereditary and/or aggressive cancers, we identified a rare KRAS-4A specific C-terminal truncating germline mutation (KRAS-4A C180X; rs373169526) in affected men of three families with hereditary prostate cancer and a patient with hereditary melanoma (minor allele frequency [MAF] of 0.0014 in these combined cancer cohorts assessed vs. 0.000056 in the ExAC population database, odds ratio 24.6 [95% confidence interval 5.1-103.5], two sided Fisher’s exact test p = 9.0E-5). The KRAS-4A C180X mutation truncates the C-terminus, removing the polybasic region and -CAAX motifs previously demonstrated to be necessary for Ras family member membrane association, MAP kinase signaling activation and transformation, suggesting a loss of function phenotype. However, in silico assessment of reported human variation demonstrates truncating germline variants only in KRAS-4A and not KRAS-4B, consistent with tolerance. Expression of KRAS-4A protein in NIH3T3 and MDCK leads to loss of exclusive membrane association and inhibits GTP loading, as expected, but paradoxically resulted in modest but significantly increased proliferation and soft agar colony growth compared to control or wildtype KRAS expressing cells. Pro-oncogenic phenotypes were not dependent on MAPK signaling, but showed sensitivity to AKT inhibition. In summary, we identified a germline truncating KRAS-4A mutation over-represented in hereditary cancers that defines a novel mechanism of KRAS activation not dependent on the C-terminal polybasic and -CAAX motifs.']",

Given their germline-biased expression pattern, these Cancer-Testes antigens (CT-antigens, CTAs) may afford the potential for an extraordinary therapeutic window, if they are required for tumorigenic behaviors. While the function of CTAs in normal and neoplastic settings remains obscure, mounting evidence suggests that specific CTAs can contribute to tumor cell autonomous behaviors. To generate a more comprehensive understanding of the functional roles of CTAs, we have employed an unbiased, multi-dimensional, loss of function discovery platform to systematically assess the contribution of CT-antigens to a range of tumorigenic signaling pathways and phenotypes. By employing a diverse panel of 11 tumor-derived cell lines to screen 120 CTAs, we find that these tumor-activated genes are required to support a number of the hallmarks of cancer. For example, we reveal multiple MAGE family members that mitigate response to mitotic stress and hypoxia. Additionally, we find that the SPANX family of CTAs contributes to -catenin signaling. Finally, we reveal a role for GAGE proteins in supporting the viability of a range of tumor types. The diversity of neoplastic settings analyzed in our primary screen allowed for the identification of CTAs that support tumor cell fitness in multiple disease backgrounds. For example, we have uncovered CTAs that contribute to mitochondrial integrity in lung, breast, melanoma and sarcoma. Alternatively, we find that CTAs can display lineage selective dependencies, such as supporting TGF signaling in claudin-low breast tumors. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that CTAs are frequently integrated into the tumor cell regulatory environment to support cell division, survival and modulate stress responses by regulating key signaling pathways.

        "Background":"['Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy (MVA', ' OMIM 257300) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome associated with growth deficiency of prenatal onset, microcephaly, intellectual disability, anomalies of the central nervous system, mild physical dysmorphic features and predisposition to cancer. Of the 37 reported cases of MVA, the cancers reported include Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and leukemia. The cells from MVA patients demonstrate variable whole chromosome loss and gains suggesting an underlying chromosome segregation dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated biallelic loss-of-function mutations in mitotic spindle-assembly checkpoint gene BUB1B or a centrosomal microtubule stabilizing gene CEP57 in some MVA patients. Therefore, the goal of this project is to identify novel causative genes that contribute to the development of MVA.We have identified one patient diagnosed with clinical features of MVA associated with myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood karyotype demonstrated low-level mosaicism with multiple clones of various chromosomal gains such as trisomy 1, 5, 6, 8 and 18. Molecular sequence analysis confirmed normal BUB1B and CEP57 in this patient. Therefore, whole-exome sequencing is being used as an approach to identify disease-causing genes in our patient. Exome data analysis assuming an autosomal recessive model and Sanger sequencing confirmed four putative genes with biallelic mutations in AIM1 (absent in melanoma 1), EPS15 (epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15), MICALL2 (molecule interacting with CasL-like protein 2) and ZSCAN12 (zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 12). Review of literature reveals potential roles of these genes on cytoskeleton, mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis.To further investigate these potential loci in our MVA patient, we designed cellular and functional assays using patient skin fibroblasts. Using interphase-FISH analysis, we have recapitulated the aneuploidy phenotype with abnormal chromosome numbers involving trisomy 8 in the patient skin fibroblasts. Moreover, immunocytochemistry with cytoskeletal and mitotic markers display aberrant anaphase with dysfunctional spindle mid-zone and cytokinesis failure. In addition, the patient fibroblasts also exhibited increased percentage of binucleated and micronucleated progeny due to abnormal chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. In summary, exome sequencing revealed a small number of potential causative genes as the etiology of MVA in our patient. Our early results demonstrate biomarkers for chromosome instability and aneuploidy such as non-disjunction, cytokinesis failure, micronuclei and binucleation in patient fibroblasts. Further work will determine whether dysregulation of these candidate genes can recapitulate this instability phenotype leading to mosaic aneuploidy in our patient.']",

        "Background":"[\"Immune checkpoint blockade antibodies (eg. anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1) enhance T cell anti-tumor activity and have produced exciting and durable results in treatment of a number of cancers including melanoma. Unfortunately, response to first generation checkpoint blockade therapy is limited to a subset of patients. A more comprehensive understanding of the genes and molecules involved in T cell checkpoint control and other aspects of anti-tumor T cell activity may allow a wider patient population to benefit from this exciting and new approach to cancer therapy.To this end, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify gene pathways that influence intratumoral T cell infiltration using Sleeping Beauty (SB) mutagenesis. More specifically, this genetic T cell screen was designed to identify additional genes and molecules responsible for selection and expansion of intratumoral T cells via a variety of T cell processes including T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation, clonal expansion of tumor-specific T cells, T cell trafficking into the tumor, and maintenance of prolonged viability once there. Advantages of using SB in a genetic screen include the ability to cause both gain- and loss-of-function mutations, as well as mutagenesis of the entire genome followed by easy identification of insertion sites. In addition, SB screens are performed in vivo, and thus preserve the complexity of the tumor microenvironment.We generated a pilot cohort of mice (n = 12) with SB-mutagenized endogenous T cells. These mice were challenged with syngeneic B16F0 melanoma cells subcutaneously. After tumor development (21 days after tumor challenge), tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were harvested. Splenic T cells representing unselected CD4+ and CD8+ populations were also isolated from the same animals at time of tumor harvest. Harvested T cells were evaluated by high throughput sequencing to identify SB insertion sites. T cells harvested from tumors demonstrated a decrease in clonal insertion sites compared to splenic T cells suggesting intratumoral clonal selection. Moreover, clonal insertions in intratumoral T cells were significantly enriched in or near genes, signifying likely selection for insertions impacting gene function (p<0.000003, Fisher's exact test). Clonal insertion sites in T cells from tumors that were absent from spleens, representing potential immunotherapy targets and including insertion sites in genes known to be associated with the T cell response, were identified. We are currently in the process of expanding this experimental cohort using a larger number of mice.We conclude T cell specific SB mutagenesis has the potential to identify novel molecules that influence intratumoral T cell infiltration and can be used to identify additional genes that may contribute to the anti-tumor T cell response.\"]",

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND', ' BRCA associated protein 1 (BAP1) was discovered as a protein associated with the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA), and genetic mutations of BAP1 gene have recently been found in some malignant tumors, such as melanoma, mesothelioma, and renal cell carcinoma. Since the mutations of BAP1 gene resulted in loss of function of this protein and were associated with poor prognoses of the malignancies, BAP1 is now considered as a tumor-suppressor gene. Recent studies have shown that BAP1 mutations were also observed in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), which is one of the most aggressive carcinoma with poor prognoses. However, only a few studies have investigated the role of BAP1 mutation on biological function of tumor cells and on clinicopathological features of IHCC. PURPOSE', ' The purpose of this study was to elucidate the association of BAP1 and IHCC. METHOD', ' The expression of BAP1 was immunohistochemically analyzed in surgically resected IHCC specimens, and the cases were classified into three groups based on the result of immunostaining concentration; positive or weakly positive or negative. The clinicopathological factors, such as the disease stage of IHCC, curability and overall survival (OS), were compared among the groups. In cell culture analyses, the expression of BAP1 in IHCC cell lines (HuCC-T1 and TFK-1) was down-regulated by Zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and siRNA in vitro. Then, cell-proliferation assay, migration assay, invasion assay, and drug-susceptibility test were performed on BAP1 down-regulated cells. RESULTS', ' The immunohistochemistry of BAP1 on IHCC specimens showed that OS was not significantly changed among three groups. However, the cases with lower expression of BAP1 including weakly positive and negative tended to be advanced in disease stage compared with cases with BAP1 positive. Interestingly, in the patients received postoperative gemcitabine, a standard chemo-drug for cholangiocarcinoma, cases with lower expression of BAP1 showed prolonged survival compared with cases with BAP1 positive. In cell experiments, the knock-down of BAP1 did not affect cell-proliferation of IHCC cells, however, it promoted migration and invasion of IHCC cells. Furthermore, the suppression of BAP1 enhanced chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS', ' Our study suggested that lower expression of BAP1 was associates with the progression of IHCC and with enhanced chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. BAP1 might be one of the target genes in the treatment of IHCC.']",

        "Background":"[\"Genomic lesions affecting the 1p36 chromosomal region are prevalent in variety of human malignancies, yet the tumor suppressor in this region had not been identified. We used chromosome engineering to create a series of mouse models with lesions spanning the 1p36-analagous region. These gain and loss-of-function models allowed us to pinpoint a potent tumor suppressive interval that when deleted predisposes to cancer and when duplicated causes excessive tumor suppression. We identified Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding domain protein 5 (CHD5) as the causative gene in the region, defined CHD5 as an inducer of the tumor suppressive network encoded at the Cdkn2 locus, and demonstrated that CHD5 is frequently deleted in human glioma. It is now appreciated that CHD5 is mutated in cancers of the breast, ovary, colon, and prostate, as well as in melanoma, glioma, and neuroblastoma, and furthermore, that robust CHD5 expression is a favorable indicator of patient survival following anti-cancer therapy.Although ample evidence from human studies indicates that CHD5 plays a pivotal role in cancer, the mechanism responsible for tumor suppression is not well understood. CHD5 belongs to the CHD family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins, yet CHD5's role in modulating chromatin and the consequence of CHD5 deficiency in vivo was unknown. We discovered that CHD5's tumor suppressive function is dependent on its dual plant homeodomains (PHDs)_motifs that bind specifically marked histones. The PHDs of CHD5 preferentially bind unmodified histone 3 (H3), an interaction essential for CHD5's ability to inhibit proliferation, to modulate transcription, and to suppress tumorigenesis in vivo. We recently defined CHD5 as a regulator of chromatin-mediated dynamics essential for neuronal differentiation. Whereas neural stem cells (NSCs) normally have the capacity to differentiate into neurons, NSCs from Chd5-deficient mice retain stem-like characteristics and differentiate into astrocytes at the expense of neurons. We discovered that H3K27me3_a repressive chromatin mark implicated in cancer_is depleted by CHD5 deficiency. We show that CHD5 rescues the de-differentiated phenotype of CHD5 deficient NSCs, while re-establishing global levels of H3K27me3.Our findings define CHD5 as a dosage-sensitive tumor suppressor, identify CHD5 as a member of a newly appreciated class of H3-binding PHD-containing proteins, and reveal a critical role for CHD5 in dictating stem cell fate. This provides new insight into the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for CHD5's tumor suppressive role that when perturbed, set the stage for cancer.\"]",

        "Background":"[\"Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder caused by loss of the tumour suppressor Merlin leading to the development of multiple tumours of the nervous system such as schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Merlin-deficient tumours may also occur sporadically including all schwannomas, 50-60% meningiomas and 29-38% ependymomas. Loss of functional Merlin have been also observed in other tumours e.g. mesothelioma, melanoma, and a portion of glioma, prostate and breast cancers. Current therapies for Merlin-deficient tumours, comprising surgery and radiosurgery are invasive and not fully effective therefore the emphasis has to be made on the development of new effective drug-based treatments.Schwannoma is the most common Merlin-deficient tumour, a hallmark for NF2 and a model for all other Merlin-deficient tumours. We have developed the human in vitro model for schwannoma to study tumour pathobiology and for drug testing. Using this model we have shown strong overexpression and activation of ErbB2/ErbB32, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), Insulin like growth factor receptor-I (IGF-IR) and activation of Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and Wnt/-catenin signalling pathways. Following, we have successfully tested new drugs such as AZD6244, Sorafenib, BEZ235, Lapatinib, Imatinib and Nilotinib. These studies revealed that schwannomas pathological proliferation, survival and adhesion is regulated by highly complex networks interacting and compensating each other resulting in increased tumour pathology. We suggest that the inhibition of a single target will not be sufficient to stop tumour growth and that multi-targeted therapy would be needed.Endogenous retroviruses are viruses that have integrated themselves into germ-line chromosomes and thereby become part of the human genome sequence (8%). One group, HERVK, has been found to be overexpressed in several cancers and is currently being investigated as potential immunotherapy targets. Our preliminary data demonstrate that HERVK envelope, capsid, Rec and Np9 proteins are overexpressed in human primary schwannoma cells and tissues. Additionally, HERVK envelope and capsid proteins are released from schwannoma cells. HERVK overexpression is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational level and is partially Merlin dependent. Anti-HERVK antibodies reduced schwannoma proliferation, pERK/pAKT/ pFAK and cyclin D1 levels and increased expression of p53. Also, pre-incubation of schwannoma cells with anti-HERVK antibodies prior to treatment with AZD6244 potentiated drug's efficiency. An HIV/HERVK protease inhibitor, Ritonavir, also decreased proliferation of schwannoma cells and increased the efficiency of AZD6244, Sorafenib and BEZ235 when combined. We suggest that HERVK plays a relevant role in schwannoma and possibly other Merlin-deficient tumours development and is a promising therapeutic target.\"]",

        "Background":"[\"Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the United States with the number of incidences persistently rising due to the depletion of the ozone layer and lack of adequate solar protection. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), composed of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), encompasses the vast majority of skin cancers with over 2 million new cases each year. Silibinin, an active bioflavanone was previously shown to have major protective effect against ultraviolet B radiation (UVB)-induced SCC through promoting DNA damage repair as well as inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis. To date, however, the efficacy of silibinin has not been tested against BCC, which alone accounts for about 80% of NMSC incidences. BCC mostly causes disfigurement, pain and morbidity, and warrants greater attention for its prevention and treatment. The hallmark of BCC has been the constitutive activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, mostly through the loss of function mutations in the patched (PTCH) gene. In the present study, we utilized ASZ001 cell line, derived from a mouse BCC tumor induced by UV-radiation in a PTCH1 heterozygous mouse, to evaluate the anti-cancer efficacy of silibinin against BCC. ASZ001 cells lack both copies of the PTCH1 gene and closely resembles the PTCH1 status in human BCC. We treated ASZ001 cells with either DMSO (control) or various doses of silibinin (25-100 M), and performed trypan blue exclusion, clonogenic, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution assays. Results showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) decreases the total cell number by 38-51% (p<0.001), 67-84% (p<0.001) and 40-95% (p<0.05-p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment. Clonogenic assay further confirmed the decrease in cell viability by silibinin, and we observed 18% (p<0.05), 92% (p<0.001) and 100% (p<0.001) decrease in colony formation with 25, 50 and 100 M doses of silibinin, respectively, in ASZ001 cells. Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) also increased the cell death by 2 folds (p<0.05), 3 folds (p<0.001), and 4 folds (p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment while annexin/PI staining confirmed that silibinin-induced cell death in ASZ001 cells is mainly apoptotic in nature. FACS analyses revealed that silibinin treatment significantly modulated the cell cycle distribution in ASZ001 cells, and we observed an S-phase arrest at 50 M silibinin dose and a G2M arrest at 100 M silibinin dose after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Molecular studies showed that silibinin treatment strongly decreases the expression of hedgehog signaling transcriptional factor Gli1, which is typically overexpressed in BCC and is known to regulate the expression of several oncogenes. Together, these results provide the first evidence of silibinin's efficacy against BCC cells, and suggest that silibinin could be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of both types of NMSCs.\"]",

        "Background":"['Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant central nervous system neoplasm that primarily affects very young children and has a very poor prognosis. Aside from presumed founder loss of function mutations in the SMARCB1 (BAF47/INI1/SNF5) chromatin remodeling gene, little is known of molecular drivers of AT/RT. LIN28A and LIN28B are stem cell factors that regulate thousands of RNAs and are expressed in aggressive cancers. One of the canonical downstream targets of LIN28 is the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Due to the increased stem cell factor expression in AT/RT, we hypothesized that LIN28 contributes to tumorigenesis in these neoplasms through the regulation of multiple pro-growth, stemness, and metabolic pathways. We identified increased levels of LIN28A in AT/RT primary tumors compared to normal brain using immunohistochemistry (P = 0.026 by Mann-Whitney test). We detected LIN28A or LIN28B in 100% of AT/RT cell lines by western blot or qPCR. Knockdown of LIN28A by lentiviral shRNA in the AT/RT cell lines CHLA-06-ATRT and BT37 inhibited growth, cell proliferation and colony formation and induced apoptosis. Colonies formed by BT37 and CHLA-06 cells with LIN28A knockdown were reduced by between 50 and 90 percent (BT37 p = 0.0002 sh800 vs pLKO, CHLA-06 p = 0.009 sh802 vs pLKO). A Cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) assay for apoptosis showed that LIN28A knockdown in BT37 and CHLA-06 cells led to a 4 to 6 fold increase in the percentage of cells expressing CC3 compared to controls measured by immunofluorescence (BT37 p = 0.0005 sh800 vs pLKO; CHLA-06 p = 0.004 sh802 vs pLKO). Suppression of LIN28A in orthotopic xenograft models led to a more than doubling of median survival compared to empty vector controls (48 vs 115 days - p = 0.007 by Log-rank test) showing that LIN28A is critical to AT/RT cell line tumorigenesis. We found lower KRAS expression in LIN28A knockdown cell lines compared to pLKO control using qPCR. We also found high expression levels of phospho-ERK in AT/RT primary tumors by immunohistochemistry. Increased ERK signaling correlated with LIN28A expression in AT/RT (P = 0.008, r = 0.57 by Spearman correlation). Trametinib is a MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor that has been developed through phase III clinical trials in adult melanoma. Trametinib inhibited the KRAS pathway in CHLA-06-ATRT and BT37 AT/RT cell lines as measured by suppression of p-ERK by Western blot. Treatment with Trametinib for 5 days suppressed the growth of BT37 and CHLA-06 cells (MTS assay for BT37 p = 0.003 for 1 nM and p = 0.002 for 10 nM vs DMSO control; for CHLA-06 p<0.001 for 1 nM and 10nM vs DMSO control by t-test). These data implicate LIN28/RAS/MAP kinase as key drivers of AT/RT tumorigenesis and indicate that targeting this pathway may serve as a novel therapeutic option in this aggressive pediatric malignancy.']",
