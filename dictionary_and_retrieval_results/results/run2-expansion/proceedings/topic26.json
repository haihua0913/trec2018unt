        "Background":"[\"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a serious complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and accounts for approximately 15% of all IBD-associated deaths. The likelihood of IBD-related carcinoma is greater than that of sporadic CRC. Over one half are diagnosed at stage III or IV. During the last few years we have worked on mining colon mucosal and submucosal layers for discovery of biomarkers that differentiate ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn's colitis (CC). Using LC-MS/MS, we examined signals found to be significantly different between CC and UC samples. We found a signal at m/z 5045 which was more intense in UC samples. The MALDI spectrum did not identify an intact protein entity but did identify hemoglobin chains. Macrophages are highly versatile phagocytes active in multiple roles in the immune system and key players in the inflammatory response. The microenvironment of most inflammation is filled with a large population of macrophages. In IBD, studies have found that macrophages can count for more than 50% of the exudative mass. Their presence within the inflammatory microenvironment, in some cases, has been proven to increase transformation, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. In hemorrhagic situations (as in UC) macrophages engulf erythrocytes and as a result release free heme iron (heFe). Earlier studies observed that heFe has cellular proliferation effects on colon cancer cells. Recently, the potential carcinogenic effects of heFe were documented when it was shown that heFe increases the number of aberrant crypt foci in colon mucosa. In the colon, iron is expected to increase the production of reactive oxygen (O2) species (ROS) from peroxides via the Fenton reaction, which may be the cause of cellular toxicity and even pro-mutagenic lesions. Intracellular reactions with active O2 can result in the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis by induction of gene mutations, chromosomal damage and cytotoxic effects. We hypothesize that elevated expression of mucosal free heFe would be associated with an increased risk of UC-associated CRC. To validate this will require investigating whether hemoglobin could be classified as a proliferative or transforming agent for colon cancer cells by causing reactive oxygen species release. For this purpose, we plan to study the cellular viability of differentiated colon cell line (cancer\", ' CCL 224, CCL 227 and normal', ' NCM 356 and NCM 460) after administration of hemoglobin at different concentrations. ROS production will be investigated in each step. Additionally, we intend to examine the potential cytotoxicity of hemoglobin.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' We recently described overexpression of the enzyme, cystathionine--synthase (CBS) in human CRC (but not normal colonic mucosa) produces endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) increasing tumor bioenergetics, cell proliferation, invasion, migration and promotes tumor angiogenesis. Its role in the progression of a colorectal adenoma to carcinoma remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CBS overexpression in a non-tumorigenic human CRC cell line (NCM356) is sufficient to increase cell proliferation, migration, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Methods', ' NCM356-p (parental) are non-tumorigenic when xenografted into athymic nude mice and express low levels of endogenous CBS, similar to normal colonic mucosa. RNASeq analysis determined mutation status. NCM-p were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing a CBS cDNA (NCM-C) or vector (NCM-v). H2S production was visualized with a fluorescent probe, 7-azido-4-methylcoumarine (AzMC). Cell proliferation rates where determined with a Coulter Counter. Cell migration and invasion assay were performed in Boyden chambers with NIH3T3 conditioned media (CM) as a chemoattractant. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed by soft-agar assay. Cellular bioenergetics was assessed using Oxygraph-O2K respirometer chamber. Tumorigenesis and metastasis were assessed injecting cells subcutaneously and orthotopically into nude mice, respectively. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) was used to inhibit CBS activity. Statistical significance (p0.05) set using ANOVA or non-parametric Student t-test. Results', ' CBS overepression and H2S production was verified by Western blot and AzMC fluorescence in the NCM-C cells. CBS overexpression demonstrated significantly increased proliferation rate (p<0.03 NCM-C vs. NCM-v or NCM-p) over 4 days in culture, invasion through matrigel (p<0.01), migration (p<0.001) toward NIH3T3 CM and increased colony formation in soft agar (p<0.01). CBS inhibition with AOAA (1mM) decreased invasion and migration (p<0.01) in the NCM-C cells compared to NCM-v. In high-resolution respirometry, respiratory rate was significantly higher in the NCM-C compared to -p and -v. (141.8  1.5 vs. 33.7  0.8 vs. 72.2  1.77  pmols1mg1, -p v -C p < 0.0001, -v v -C p < 0.0005, -p v -v p < 0.001). Exome-wide sequence analyses of the NCM-p identified inactivating mutations in the APC and TP53 tumor suppressor genes, and an activating mutation in KRAS. Although the NCM-C cells produced significantly larger tumors in mice compared with NCM-v or NCM-p (p<0.001 2-w ANOVA), none of the cell lines caused liver metastasis in vivo. Conclusion', ' A non-tumorigenic cell line with some known mutations can progress to a tumorigenic, but not metastatic, phenotype with CBS overexpression and H2S production. Our data supports the importance of CBS/H2S axis in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence.']",

However, the mechanisms by which tumours regulate MCs remain poorly defined.Our aim was to investigate how the colorectal TME impacts on MCs recruitment and function. Methods', ' We analyzed the phenotype of tumor infiltrating MCs compared to those resident in uninvolved tissue employing multi-colour flow cytometry (n = 21, patients with Stage II/III CRC). We generated tumor (TCM) and normal (NCM) conditioned media from (n = 40) freshly cultured colorectal tumors and assessed levels of 16 cytokines using a multiplex assay. Finally, we designed a MC', 'Cell line co-culture model to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control MC function. Results', ' We found that two distinct MC subsets HLA-DRhiCD11chi and CD11bhiCD15hi, unique to the tumor tissue (n = 19), dominated the CD45+ compartment. Further analysis showed that the HLA-DRhiCD11chi and the CD11bhiCD15hi were of monocyte (CD14&CD64) and neutrophil (CD66b&CD16) origin, respectively. In support of their potential inhibitory and proangiogenic function, we showed that the HLA-DRhiCD11chi subset expressed ILT4, PDL1 and Tie-2. The CD11bhiCD15hi subset exhibited high levels of arginase, an enzyme involved in T cell suppression. Interestingly, both cell subsets displayed an altered chemokine receptor profile compared to their blood counterparts. Accordingly, we were able to confirm the upregulated expression of inflammatory mediators, CXCL1 (p < 0.0001), CXCL5 (p < 0.0198), CCL5 (p < 0.0001), CCL4 (p < 0.0074), IL-8 (p < 0.0127), and IL-1 (p < 0.0001) in TCM compared to NCM. Finally, using both the RT2 profiler PCR array and a kinome array we identified a number of key protumor genes and mTOR signaling as potential regulators of tumor associated MCs. Conclusions', ' This study identifies two MC subsets in patients with CRC. We demonstrate that the TME recruits these cells via a complex chemokine-chemokine receptor network subsequently transforming them into a highly activated but potentially suppressive cell that favors tumor growth.']",

        "Background":"['The CAPRI clinical trial (Optimal strategy in KRAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer patients', ' cetuximab plus FOLFIRI followed by FOLFOX +/- cetuximab) enrolls metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients with no codon 12/13 (exon 2) KRAS mutations. Recent data showed that exon 3 and 4 KRAS mutations as well as NRAS exon 2, 3 and 4 mutations might confer resistance to EGFR monoclonal antibodies. In addition, somatic mutations in other genes such as BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, have been hypothesized to be prognostic and/or predictive in CRC. Therefore, molecular sub-classification of KRAS exon 2 wild type CRC might allow to identify subgroups of patients highly sensitive or resistant to anti-EGFR agents within the CAPRI trial. We analyzed 182 FFPE samples from mCRC patients enrolled in the CAPRI clinical trial by using a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach based on the Ion AmpliSeq technology. In particular, 10 ng of genomic DNA were analyzed with the Ion Ampliseq Colon and Lung cancer panel that targets over 500 hotspot mutations in 22 genes implicated in colon and lung cancers. Data analysis was performed using Ion Reporter Software. The analysis with the IonAmpliseq panel was successful in all the tested samples. Among the 182 analyzed cases, 58 (31.9%) showed no mutations in the investigated genes, whereas a total of 206 mutations in 14 genes were detected in 124 cases (68.1%). Surprisingly, 30 exon 2 KRAS mutations were identified in 29 patients (15.9%). Mutations at a frequency >4% were also found in', ' TP53 (39.5% of the cases mutant), KRAS exon 3 and 4 (7.5%), PIK3CA (13.2), BRAF (8.2%), NRAS (7.1%), FBXW7 (4.9%). A significant degree of tumor heterogeneity was observed', ' several tumors had multiple mutations in different genes, with some cases showing up to 5 mutations. In particular, 30/45 KRAS, 5/13 NRAS, 12/15 BRAF and 19/24 PIK3CA mutant cases showed variants in additional genes. The frequency of mutant alleles also differed significantly among tumors. For example, among the KRAS exon 2 mutant cases, the frequency of KRAS mutant alleles, after normalization for the neoplastic cell content, ranged between 6% and 130%, suggesting that some KRAS mutant cases were polyclonal and that in some other cases gain of mutant or loss of wild type KRAS alleles might have occurred. These data suggest that molecular classification of KRAS exon 2 wild type CRC with the Ion Ampliseq Colon and Lung cancer panel is feasible. This approach reveals mutations in several key genes involved in CRC tumor progression. The relatively high incidence of codon 12/13 KRAS mutations also suggests that an high rate of false negative results in KRAS testing occurs in clinical practice. Finally, the huge degree of tumor heterogeneity might have important implications for prognosis and response to therapy.']",

Demethylation treatment successfully restored the expression profile of the top methylated genes.Conclusion', ' Methylation of gene sets occurred in early premalignant stages followed by somatic mutations in increasing number through the AD-CRC development. Demethylation treatment could reverse the systematic, robust methylation alterations.

Aflibercept + FOLFIRI is approved for treating metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin containing regimen. We investigated the pharmacological activity of aflibercept in CRC patient derived xenografts (PDX), most metastases-derived, and characterized PDX molecular and phenotypic properties. In 48 CRC PDX, Whole Exome Sequencing revealed', ' 85% APC, 79% TP53, 51% KRAS, 3% NRAS, 25% PIK3CA, 11% PTEN and 8% BRAF mutants. There was no significant association between angiogenic factors, tumor mutation profiles, and response to aflibercept.In tumors, protein levels of human (h) VEGF-A were significantly higher than mouse (m) VEGF-A, hPlGF, and mPlGF (Chiron et al, ESMO, 2013). Affymetrix probes detected VEGF-A and PIGF but not VEGF-B mRNA in most PDX. There was no significant association between expression of angiogenic factors and response to aflibercept. Histological sections of CRC tumors from PDX, xenografts created from cell lines, and patients tumor specimens indicated that stromal involvement in human tumors was recapitulated in PDX but not in tumors from cell lines. PlGF expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on colon cancer tissue arrays. A significant number of colon cancer specimens were positive for PlGF, expressed in tumor cells and stroma. Aflibercept resulted in anti-tumor activity in 47/48 CRC PDX models and complete tumor stasis in 31/48 models. Efficacy data from 5 PDX models responsive to aflibercept and CRC standard of care (SOC) drugs, all administered as monotherapies, are below. The robust activity of aflibercept in CRC PDX models that are sensitive to SOC drugs suggest that CRC patients would benefit from aflibercept treatment, independently of mutational status or expression of angiogenic factors.']",

CMN and sarcopenia may increase treatment related toxicity (TRT) due to acquired pharmacokinetic variability and altered drug metabolism. Little is known about the prevalence of CMN among pts enrolling on P1/2 trials, its association with abnormal physical and psychological functioning, and its role in mediating TRT. Methods', ' Pts initiating a P1/2 trial were recruited. Study acceptance rate was > 95%. Pts had a comprehensive nutritional assessment using the validated PG-SGA, a short, 3-5 minute tool that evaluates multiple nutritional domains [symptom burden, functional status, metabolic stress and physical exam (muscle/fat status)]. CMN is defined as a PG-SGA score of  9. Distress, anxiety, depression and physical activity were also measured. BMI and albumin were extracted from the chart. Statistical significance was determined by Fishers exact test. Results', ' 54 pts (85% P1) were enrolled. CMN was identified in 39%. Pts with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers were more likely to have CMN than non-GI cancers (75% vs 24%, p = 0.001); otherwise, CMN rates were not different by age ( < 60 vs 60+), gender, race, or trial phase (1 vs 2). CMN was also associated with number of lines of therapy, but was surprisingly less common among patients with > 2 therapies compared to those with 0-2 (29% vs 57%, p = 0.051). Strong associations of CMN to distress (p = 0.028), depression (p = 0.020) and sedentary lifestyle (p = 0.012) were also seen. Clinical red flags of MN such as low BMI ( < 25) and low albumin ( < 3.5) had poor sensitivity (66.7% and 33.3%) and specificity (57.6% and 78.8%) for CMN. Correlation of CMN to TRT is underway. Conclusions', ' CMN is prevalent among P1/2 trial pts, notably in those with GI cancers and with fewer lines of therapy, and is associated with physical inactivity, distress and depression. BMI and albumin are poorly predictive of CMN. Undiagnosed CMN may, through multiple pathways, increase the vulnerability of pts on P1/2 studies to TRT.

        "Background":"[\"The monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab are approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC). When used as monotherapy, the anti-EGFR antibodies are effective in approximately 15% of patients. It is now well established that colorectal tumors carrying KRAS and BRAF mutations (40%) are refractory to EGFR targeted therapies (primary resistance). Virtually all-responsive patients eventually become insensitive to anti-EGFR antibodies (secondary resistance) within 3 to 12 months of initiating therapy. Primary and acquired resistance therefore limits the clinical benefit of EGFR blockade in CRC patients.We postulated that concomitant inhibition of multiple members of the HER (ErbB) receptors family might suppress the growth of CRC cells more effectively than selectively targeting only the EGFR with cetuximab or panitumumab.Accordingly, we assessed the pharmacological activity of momelotinib and afatinib- two pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors- in a collection of 40 CRC cell lines, which recapitulate the genetic profiles commonly detected in CRC patients. We report that primary resistance to pan-HER inhibition is associated with KRAS and BRAF mutations thus suggesting that this patients' population will unlikely benefit from momelotinib and afatinib treatments. Notably, however, pan-HER blockade was effective in a subset of KRAS/BRAF wild type CRC cell lines refractory to cetuximab and panitumumab indicating that a subgroup of patients, which do not benefit from EGFR blockade, may profit from pan-HER inhibition.To define the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to ErbB inhibitors, three KRAS/BRAF/NRAS wild type CRC cell models were continuously treated with cetuximab, momelotinib and afatinib, until resistant derivatives emerged. Genetic characterization of such derivatives unveiled that, regardless of the drug used, the resistant populations were a mixture of clones carrying distinctive mutations in KRAS or NRAS. Detailed biochemical analyses of the ErbB signalling pathway revealed that resistant variants displayed high levels of MEK and ERK activation, which persisted upon ErbBs inhibition.Collectively, these results identify KRAS, BRAF and NRAS mutations as major drivers of primary and/or acquired resistance to HERs inhibition in colorectal cancer cells and suggest that a molecularly defined subset of CRC patients might benefit from pan-HER blockade.\"]",

Multiplex PCR and Ion Torrent sequencing was used to examine 98.8% of the targeted exons and splice junctions at a depth of sequencing that allowed for high confidence variant calling (most bases were covered by  500 reads). After alignment and variant calling, we annotated the variants with information from the 1000 Genomes Project, COSMIC, Polyphen2, and PFAM domain and transcription factor motifs. Excluding synonymous SNVs, 3 variants in adenoma, and 692 variants in tumors were detected. Two were known pathogenic variants (MSH6 p.R965H and APC p.R1432X).

Remarkably, 10 of 14 CRC tumors (71%) with a PIK3CA mutation also have a KRAS mutation. In TC, we found mutations of BRAF (63%), RET-PTC (7%), and PIK3CA/KRAS/NRAS/HRAS (1.5% each). Conclusions', ' Prospective tumor genotyping for PCMR patients reveals a remarkable diversity of potentially druggable mutations, knowledge of which will help in clinical trial enrollment. While rare in the examined tumors, mutations in FGFR2, MEK1/2, AKT1/2, PDGFRA and RET could be targeted as part of individualized cancer treatments.

We hypothesized that an anti-EGFR antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that used EGFR to target the tumor and deliver a cytotoxic payload rather than blocking EGFR pathways may be useful for K/NRAS mutant EGFR expressing cancers. To this end, an anti-EGFR ADC was designed using a meditope-directed site-specific conjugation strategy. This strategy uses proprietary peptides that bind an antibody Fab fragment noncovalently in a unique site outside the paratope. This novel binding is exploited for site-specific covalent conjugation of cytotoxic payloads to any meditope-enabled antibody. The meditope peptide can be designed with a photoactivatable side chain, allowing the peptide-antibody interaction to be covalent.

Although chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies can improve survival rates, recent studies have shown the potential benefit of immunotherapies to improve outcomes for patients with advanced CRC. Targeted therapies that use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to EGFR have been shown to benefit some CRC patients. Until recently, KRAS has been the only predictive biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy for metastatic CRC. However, 40% to 60% of patients with wild-type KRAS do not respond to anti-EGFR therapy. Therefore, to accurately predict patients response to treatments and improve clinical outcomes, additional prediction and treatment methods are imperative. One of the many efforts to improve prediction for CRC patient's response to the anti-EGFR therapy is the development of gene expression based RAS signature scores for identification of RAS activated tumors independent of mutations in the KRAS gene. Recently there have been major advances in immunotherapeutic approaches in a wide variety of cancers. In solid tumors such as melanoma and colon cancers, immune checkpoints have been shown to improve clinical outcomes. There is considerable effort being placed on combinations of targeted therapy and immunotherapies to improve responses for these cancers. Similarly, since no single treatment can apply to all CRC patients, we aim to stratify patients using a combination of three methods\", ' 1. RAS signature score based on the expression profile of 18 genes. This RAS signature score enables measurements of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) pathway functional output independent of tumor genotype. 2. Expression profile of immune checkpoint inhibitor target genes, such as PD1 and PDL1, and 3. In-silico prediction of neo-antigens and peptide binding affinity between tumor antigens derived from mutations and human HLA alleles.55 FFPE samples were selected from a cohort of 468 samples with matching FF samples. These 55 samples have about 1', '1', '1 ratio of high, medium and low RAS scores. Here we showed our ability to obtain RAS signature scores with concordant results using different platforms including RNA-seq, targeted RNA-seq, Nanostring and Affymetrix microarray. Samples that have RAS activating mutations such as KRAS and BRAF have significant higher RAS scores (p<0.001). Interestingly, expression of PD-L1 was significantly lower in tumor samples harboring mutations of genes such as MET, PTEN, NRAS, FBXW7, and GNAS. Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the expression of PD-L1 was significantly lower in samples with higher RAS signature scores (p<0.05).

Genomic characterization of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of mCRC have revealed additional resistance mechanisms to the EGFR MAb cetuximab including amplification of MET, HER2 and mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 (Bertotti et al. 2011, 2015).

Phosphoproteomics allows for comprehensive protein phosphorylation profiling, and thereby may shed new insights into the biology of CRC and the molecular basis of cetuximab response.Aim', ' To identify aberrant signaling pathways, predictive biomarkers, and alternative drug targets in genomically-annotated CRC PDX models by mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics.Methods', ' We performed LC-MS/MS based phosphoproteome profiling (van der Mijn et al. 2015; Piersma et al. 2015) on untreated CRC PDX models lacking KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutation (n = 20).

MS/MS data was searched using MaxQuant. Phosphoproteome data (ion intensities and spectral counts) were correlated with drug sensitivity. Dedicated bioinformatics was used to identify hyperactive kinases and signaling pathways in individual tumors.Results', ' The dataset contained 13.418 tyrosine-, serine- and threonine-phosphorylated peptides derived from 4588 proteins, including 237 phosphorylated kinases.

        "Background":"['Background', ' The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a key driver of tumor growth in colorectal cancer (CRC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although EGFR inhibitors prolong overall survival in many patients, resistance inevitably develops. Resistance usually arises through alterations in the EGFR pathway itself or through upregulation of alternative signaling pathways. In CRC in particular, mutations in KRAS and NRAS are strong predictors of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Such resistance may potentially be overcome by combining MM-151, a potent EGFR inhibitor, with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor. In KRAS/NRAS wild-type tumors, resistance may arise through activation of parallel signaling pathways. Emerging data suggest that heregulin (HRG)-driven signaling through ErbB3 and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-driven signaling through IGF-1R may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors by activating pro-survival signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. If HRG-mediated signaling is active, resistance may potentially be overcome through the combined administration of MM-151 and the ErbB3-targeting antibody MM-121. Similarly, if IGF-1-mediated signaling is active, resistance may be overcome by combining MM-151 with the IGF-1R-targeting antibody MM-141. The rationale underlying this trial is that mechanisms of resistance may be identified through biomarker analyses, allowing patients to be prospectively assigned to an appropriate investigational regimen. Methods', ' This is a Phase 1, biomarker-directed open-label study evaluating the safety, pharmacology and preliminary activity of MM-151 in combination with trametinib, MM-121, or MM-141.

In addition to mutational analysis, transcriptional profiling has been recently exploited to identify distinct CRC molecular subtypes, associated with biological and clinical features such as cell of origin, microsatellite instability, prognosis and response to treatments. Detailed analysis of the relationships between the subtypes and clinical/biological features requires a large panel of preclinical models closely recapitulating the molecular heterogeneity of CRC. To this aim, we assembled a large collection of 151 CRC cell lines. For each line, we', ' (i) verified genetic identity by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis; (ii) assessed microsatellite instability (MSI) status; (iii) sequenced mutational hotspots in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA genes; (iv) performed microarray-based global mRNA expression profiling; (v) evaluated sensitivity to the EGFR-targeting drug cetuximab. STR analysis revealed that some cell lines previously thought to be unrelated are indeed derived from the same individual. This result was confirmed by cell line hierarchical clustering based on mRNA expression profiles. Overall, the mutational landscape of the compendium was concordant with what observed in patients (mutation rates', ' KRAS = 47%; BRAF = 17%; NRAS = 0.7%; PIK3CA = 18%). Similarly, sensitivity to cetuximab was confined to lines without RAS or BRAF mutations. Gene expression profiling was exploited to assign cell lines to molecular subtypes, according to five different published transcriptional classifiers. We found that all molecular subtypes previously identified in CRC patients were robustly maintained in the lines. Moreover, significant overlaps were detected between individual subtypes across distinct classifiers. Subtype-specific molecular and pharmacological associations previously defined in CRC samples were largely recapitulated in the compendium. In particular, MSI+ cells were significantly enriched in inflammatory and goblet subtypes and less prevalent in the Transit Amplifying (TA) and Stem groups. Cell lines carrying BRAF mutations clustered in the inflammatory subtype, while RAS mutations were equally distributed among all subtypes. Notably, in TA lines without RAS or BRAF mutations, the fraction of cetuximab-sensitive cells was strongly enriched (56%), confirming clinical data and indicating that addiction to the EGFR pathway is an intrinsic feature of this CRC subtype.

Additionally, CancerPlex detected the other mutations of MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, and BRAF). The Fishers exact test revealed a significant association between HER2 status and HER2 amplification detected with CancerPlex (P< 0.001), however, there was no significant association between HER2 status and HER2 mutation. Conclusions', ' We found 8 of 100 (8%) Japanese CRC cases are HER2 positive. There is a significant association between HER2 status and HER2 amplification detected with CancerPlex. CancerPlex is a comprehensive testing tool for detecting gene alterations including not only mutations of MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, and BRAF), but also HER2 amplification, which is a possible useful predictor of the candidates for HER2 targeted therapies in CRC.']",

        "Background":"['REDX05358 has been identified as a novel, highly selective and potent next generation pan RAF inhibitor with improved therapeutic potential and predicted safety profile. Aberrant signalling via the MAPK pathway is commonly seen in cancer. RAF inhibitors such as Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib have been approved for the treatment of unresectable and metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma, but these agents lack efficacy in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), partly because of EGFR-mediated feedback reactivation of the MAPK pathway via CRAF. Furthermore, RAF inhibitor treatment of RAS-mutant, BRAF wildtype melanomas has been associated with other skin cancers, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma due to MAPK pathway paradoxical activation mediated by CRAF. There is therefore a clinical need for novel agents targeting the MAPK pathway that do not have these undesirable properties. Here we present, REDX05358 that demonstrates subnanomolar binding affinity for BRAF and CRAF with high selectivity profile against a panel of 468 kinases that exhibits negligible paradoxical activation due to inhibition of both RAF monomers and dimers. As a result, REDX05358 not only inhibits MAPK signalling in BRAF V600E mutant tumor cells, but also in those harbouring NRAS and KRAS mutations. Furthermore, REDX05358 does not induce feedback reactivation of the pathway through its ability to sustain inhibition of MAPK signalling in CRC cell lines. Correspondingly, profiling of REDX05358 in a panel of CRC, melanoma and NSCLC cell lines shows it has potent anti-proliferative activity in cell lines harbouring BRAF or RAS mutations. REDX05358 is an orally bioavailable, well tolerated small molecule that has demonstrated in vivo efficacy in BRAF V600E CRC xenograft model. In contrast, first generation inhibitors such as Vemarafenib and Dabrafanib have been reported to be ineffective in this genetic background in CRC cell lines and patients. Thus, we have developed a pan RAF inhibitor with unique pharmacological properties enabling it to have utility in treating BRAF and RAS mutant cancers']",

Results', ' Mean TML was highest in melanoma (Mel; 21 mt/MB), NSCLC (11 mt/MB), and bladder cancer (BLC; 11 mt/MB), whereas prostate cancer (PC), pancreas adenocarcinoma (PA), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) had the lowest levels (all 6 mt/MB). High TML was seen most frequently in Mel (36%), NSCLC (15%), BLC (15%), and anal cancer (SCCA; 9%); and least frequently in PA (1.6%) and RCC (0.5%).

Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

The most common BRAF mutation (V600E) occurs in approximately 70% of primary melanomas and 10% of colorectal cancers. Melanoma patients carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation respond with frequency of 80% to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, while colon cancer patients respond at a rate of 5% only, indicative of intrinsic resistance. Moreover, clinical benefit is further limited by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance among vemurafenib responders. Combination therapy targeting both BRAF(V600E) and possible escape pathways appears to be a promising approach to reverse resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular characterization and in vitro chemosensitivity profiles of 20 melanoma and 20 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Four of the colon and 11 of the melanoma cell lines were established at Oncotest from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Molecular profiles include the mutation status of BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS (exon sequencing) and protein levels for components of the MAPK, EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways (Western blot analysis). Sensitivity profiles for inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, EGFR and PI3K were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based survival and proliferation assay. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors was investigated by combination of vemurafenib with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or inhibitors of potential escape pathways like EGFR, PI3K/AKT or c-MET and evaluated by combination index according to Chou-Talalay.In line with the clinical situation, the BRAF V600E substitution was found in 13/20 (65%) of the melanoma and only in 4/20 (20%) of the colon cancer cell lines. BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in melanoma cell lines and KRAS mutations did not occur at all. Among the colon cancer cell lines, in addition to the BRAF(v600E) mutation, alteration in KRAS (10/20 cell lines), PIK3CA (6/20) and NRAS (1/20) were detected. Chemosensitivity profiling revealed intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors for 3/13 (23%) BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and for 3/4 (75%) BRAF(V600E) colon cancer cell lines. Reversal of the resistance of BRAF inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cell lines was recorded as synergism between vemurafenib and inhibitors of vasious kinases (c-MET, AKT, PI3K, MEK, or EGFR. A particularly strong synergistic interaction was found for vemurafenib and the c-MET inhibitor SU11274, irrespective of BRAF status. For colon cancer cell lines, the strongest synergisms were detected for the combinations of vemurafenib with inhibitors of c-MET, EGFR, PI3K, AKT and MEK.Displaying similar mutation and chemosensitivity profiles as melanomas and colon cancers in the clinic, the present cell line panels represent valuable tools to investigate the reversal of resistance towards BRAF inhibitors.']",

KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations were tested using pyrosequencing. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is defined by the presence of different tumoral subclones within the same tumor mass. Inter-tumoral heterogeneity consists in the presence of different tumor subclones in various tumor sites (i.e. primary tumor, metastatic lymph nodes or metastases). Results', ' Among the 60 tumor areas, 35 were KRAS mutated (in 11 tumors), 8 NRAS mutated (in 3 tumors) and one BRAF mutated(in 1 tumor). In primary tumors (n = 18), intra-tumoral heterogeneity for RAS mutation was found in 8 patients (44%). Inter-tumoral heterogeneity for RAS mutation between primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes or distant metastasis (n = 11) was found in 6 patients (54%). Moreover, 5 tumors had multiple RAS mutated subclones in the same tumor (28%). Indeed, we observed the coexistence of different KRAS mutations (n = 3) as well as KRAS and NRAS mutations (n = 4). Conclusions', ' A high proportion of CRC presented intra- and/or inter-tumoral heterogeneity, which has relevant clinical implications for anti-EGFR mAbs prescription. These results suggest the need for multiple RAS testing in different part of the same tumor and/or more sensitive techniques.']",

We correlated DUSP1, 4, 6 (isoforms a & b) & 8 mRNA expression level in FFPE primary colorectal cancer (CRC) of 186 chemorefractory patients treated with cetuximab (CTX) with KRAS MUT state and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods', ' KRAS codon 12,13, 61&146, BRAF V600E and NRAS codon 12&13 MUT were analyzed with the Sequenom MALDI TOF MassArray system. The DUSPs and 3 housekeeping genes were quantified by qRT-PCR.

        "Background":"['Although histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are considered a promising novel therapeutic approach in the light of their potent tumour-selective effects, the use of these inhibitors for treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) have thus far demonstrated limited success as a monotherapy. What this eventually boils down to is our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms, the impact of oncogenes, and thus the key pathways through which HDACi affect tumour cell growth. To shed further light on this, the involvement of oncogenic RAS - a key driver of CRC, in determining the responsiveness to HDACi has been explored. By using cell line model systems harbouring conditional oncogenic NRAS, KRAS and HRAS, we uncovered an oncogenic RAS-dependent “safeguard” mechanism imposed in order to evade the cytotoxic effect of HDACi and therefore apoptosis. Characteristically, cells harbouring oncogenic RAS were observed to undergo a reversible senescence-like growth arrest in G2, allowing for re-entry into cell cycle following the withdrawal of HDACi. This mechanism is implemented as a consequence of the direct targeting of RAS by HDAC inhibition, which resulted in a further amplified GTP-binding activity and subsequent signalling through the MAPK pathway. The observed outcome was an increase in the priming of MYC for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, thereby enabling the cells to exit the cell cycle and enter the protective state of G2 arrest. This process was functionally reversed with a conditional non-degradable MYC (T58A/S62A), which in turn rendered the cells more susceptible to undergo apoptosis. Conclusively, in the context of a constitutively activating RAS mutation, the prospect of HDACi treatment was effectively improved using current MAPK-targeted therapy by preventing the observed pro-oncogenic effect of the HDACi treatment alone.']",

        "Background":"[\"Benign adenomatous colon polyps are thought to be transformed into cancers through the stepwise accumulation of mutations. However, not all polyps progress. A significant number remain static in size, regress, or resolve completely. The mechanisms underlying these differential fates are unknown, and currently there are no biological characteristics that can reliably predict which polyps will grow or progress into invasive cancer. To determine the mutational landscape, targeted next generation sequencing was performed on a unique collection of small (6-9mm) colorectal polyps with known growth rates based on interval imaging with CT colonography. To determine spatial location of identified mutations within a polyp, micro-dissection was performed followed by quantitative PCR to validate low frequency mutations. The mutational landscape of small polyps is varied both within and among individual polyps. Polyps carried 0-3 pathogenic mutations with the most frequent being in APC (67%, 32/48), KRAS/NRAS (17%, 8/48), BRAF (17%, 8/48), FBXW7 (10%, 5/48), and TP53 (8%, 4/48). Additionally, 13% (6/48) contained driver mutations at varied mutant allele frequencies, indicating the presence of subclonal populations. In silico modeling of tumor growth was used to determine the likely size at which additional driver mutations arose in order to observe those varied frequencies. This model of colon tumor growth was adapted so that mutations occur with a given probability of 105, which may change the fitness positively or negatively, and the lineage from these mutant subpopulations was tracked during tumor growth. In silico polyps were sectioned and mutant allele frequency was recorded and compared to the frequencies observed from the targeted sequencing of human polyps. Contrary to the slow step-wise accumulation of mutations theory, these data indicate small colonic polyps can have multiple pathogenic mutations in crucial driver genes that arise early in a tumor's existence. Understanding the molecular pathway of tumorigenesis and clonal evolution in polyps that are at risk for progressing to invasive cancers will allow us to begin to better predict which polyps may be more likely to progress into adenocarcinomas and which patients are predisposed to developing advanced disease.\"]",

A dual strand approach distinguishes true mutations from artifacts commonly found in DNA from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue. Analytical performance of this panel was characterized.Methods', ' FFPE tissue was examined for tumor content and area. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue, cell lines and plasmids. The DNA quality and quantity were simultaneously determined through a quantitative PCR measurement of amplifiability. TruSeq Custom Amplicon technology targeting each strand of DNA was used to construct NGS libraries. Sequencing was performed on the MiSeqDx, and the Illumina Somatic Variant Caller was used to call somatic variants.Results', ' The dual-strand amplicon approach results in high accuracy by eliminating false positives observed on one strand of DNA typical of an FFPE artifact, by requiring every variant to be detected on both strands. We evaluated performance on 500 FFPE CRC samples processed with the Extended RAS panel. Concordance against Qiagen TheraScreen and Sanger Sequencing results was evaluated. The somatic variant caller yields a specificity of 0.98 and sensitivity of 0.72 for variants in the 5%-10% range, and a specificity of 0.96 and sensitivity of 0.98, overall, where we take the alternate methods as truth.

Several studies have shown that specific mutations in KRAS and NRAS are less likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapies. Several diagnostics have been developed to identify such mutations. However, in a large number of cancer patients, tumor biopsy poses a significant health risk thereby limiting the tissue available for current molecular diagnostics. Non-invasive liquid biopsy diagnostics are revolutionizing cancer treatment selection, patient prognosis, and monitoring. Low abundance circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is purified from patient plasma and used as an alternative source of genomic material for detecting tumor mutations. Currently available qPCR kits for detecting RAS mutations have a limited sensitivity and coverage since they are not optimized for liquid biopsy purposes. Methods', ' We have developed a two-step PCR to qPCR method to identify down to single mutant copies of KRAS or NRAS in ctDNA isolated from plasma. The mutant copies are first enriched by a novel multiplexed formula of primers and wildtype (WT) allele blockers. The mutations are then identified by EntroGens RAS Mutation Screening Panel or next generation sequencing (NGS). Synthetic mutant DNA was spiked in a background of WT DNA purified from plasma to yield a range of mutant allelic burden over WT background.

        "Background":"['Introduction There are numerous causes triggering CRC. 25-80% of CRC shown a deregulation in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) pathway. Two signaling pathways downstream of the EGFR are dysregulated in CRC the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF (MAPK pathway) and PIK3CA affect prognosis and/or response to anti-EGFR MoAb. PTEN is a downstream effector of EGFR pathway and is involved in PI3K pathway. Loss of PTEN protein expression can occur through epigenetic silencing and mutation or allelic loss. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the most effective way to assay for loss of PTEN expression. IHC lack of reproducibility and this has lead to discordant results regarding the concordant in paired CRC metastases and primary tumors.The aim of the work was to asses the feasibility of PTEN gene expression analysis from FFPE tissue in CRC samples.Materials and methods We selected a series of 33 patients, already tested for KRAS mutational status and resulted wild-type. At the time of the study mutational status of NRAS gene has not a role as predictive marker, so was not performed. A retrospective analysis on CRC FFPE tissue was performed. As control samples we have selected specimen of colorectal surgery not tumor-associated (diverticulitis). On these samples BRAF mutational analysis and PTEN gene expression was performed. For BRAF analysis, DNA was extracted by means of QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit (Qiagen, USA). BRAF mutational status was assed through direct automated sequencing (3100 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan mutation detection assay (ABI PRIM 7900HT, Applied Biosystems). For PTEN gene expression, total RNA was obtained through the miRNeasy FFPE tissue kit (Qiagen, USA), according to manufacturer instructions, and reverse transcribed. PTEN expression was assessed by means of TaqMan probes.Results According to BRAF mutational status we have found 10/33 (30%) mutated samples. PTEN expression levels were evaluated by the comparison of tumor samples vs diverticula samples, the data obtained were then integrated with those from BRAF mutational analysis. Interestingly we found that all the BRAF mutated samples present also a down-regulation of PTEN. Statistical analyses were conducted through the X2 test with the Yatesha correction (p=0.00023). The p-value was also calculated Exact Fisher Test (p= 0.00021) to confirm the results.Conclusion The determination of PTEN gene expression level is feasible with real-time PCR using TaqMan probe technology. BRAF analysis might be used as prognostic and/or predictive marker in CRC patients treatment. The identification of a validated method for PTEN analysis would establish it as a molecular marker meriting further investigation in large numbers of available primary tumors from patients with CRC.

        "Background":"['Background. Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway is implicated in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor growth. Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in colon, pancreatic, and lung cancers; BRAF mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant melanomas and from 40-60% of papillary thyroid cancers. MEK, a dual specific kinase, is a key player in this pathway; it is downstream of both Ras and Raf and activates ERK1/2 through phosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues. MEK162 (ARRY 438162) is a novel small molecule ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of the kinases MEK1 and MEK2. MEK162 showed promising data in an ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in patients with BRAF and NRAS mutated advanced melanoma. This is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS mutated melanoma. Methods and Results. The melanoma cell line panel was the most sensitive after investigating the growth inhibitory effect of MEK162 on 328 cancer cell lines from diverse histologies including melanoma, head and neck, colon, pancreas, lung, ovarian, liver, kidney, breast and endometrial. When a cutoff of IC50 <500nM or >70% Inhibition at 1uM after 6 days of culture was used 83% out of 47 melanoma cell lines were sensitive to the treatment with the MEK inhibitor. Sensitivity to MEK162 was independent of BRAFV600E andNRASQ61mutation status in this cell line panel. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed upon exposure to MEK162 using flow cytometry. MEK162 led to a G1 arrest and marked increase in apoptotic cells in the majority of the sensitive melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin and oncogenic driver mutations. Western blots were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to MEK162 in the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a decrease in pERK in all the cell lines tested regardless of their mutational status and the in vitro sensitivity. We observed an increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and wild type for NRAS and BRAF mutations cell lines than in BRAFV600Emutant cell lines. We found pAKT and pS6 decreased in the NRAS and BRAF mutant cell lines after treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of the mTOR pathway by MEK162 may be crucial for the sensitivity to the drug.

        "Background":"['The RAS pathway is a driver of many cancers, and has been targeted for the development of a variety of therapeutic inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, and more recently ERK. One of challenging issues is to predict response to targeted therapies. Here we report identification of PTPRS, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a regulator/biomarker of ERK activation and inhibitor response in colorectal cancer. To identify the genes with high frequency mutations that might be predictive of RAS pathway dependence (“addiction”), we used a gene expression signature score to stratify 468 colorectal cancer tumors that also underwent targeted exome sequencing for 1321 cancer-associated genes. We found that, when the masking effects caused by mutant KRAS, BRAF and NRAS was iteratively removed, mutant PTPRS was strongly correlated with RAS pathway activation, with a mutation rate of 10.4% (22 out of 211 remaining tumors). This led us to inactivate PTPRS in vitro using a specific peptide inhibitor, siRNA or CRISPR approaches in various colorectal cancer cell lines. Inhibition/loss of PTPRS significantly elevated phosphorylation of ERK and AKT and substantially sensitized cancer cells to the treatment of ERK inhibitors, which was enhanced by an AKT inhibitor. Surprisingly, PTPRS did not modulate the activity of EGFR and the ERK kinase, MEK. Our data indicate that PTPRS negatively regulates ERK signaling downstream of the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK pathway in a mechanism independent of AKT and DUSP6. As a result, inactivation/loss of PTPRS promotes ERK activation and “addiction”, thereby contributing to increased sensitivity to ERK inhibitors.']",

We hereby present a simple low-cost alternative that is implementable to routine ctDNA testing.Methods', ' A panel of PCR amplicons (106 - 174bp) was resolved by denaturing capillary electrophoresis (DCE) revealing minute presence of mutation specific hetero-duplexes. The final panel consisted of clinically relevant oncogenic mutations KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR as well as cancer-related mutations in tumor suppressors TP53, APC and CTNNB1. A total of 299 patients was subsequently examined for presence of ctDNA in plasma including 194 with colorectal cancer (CRC), 26 with NSCLC and 79 with pancreatic cancer (PanC).

The highest detection rate, 69%, was observed in Stage IV CRC patients. Comparison with tumor markers (TM) revealed 62% of cases positive for both TM and ctDNA and 13% TM-negative cases with ctDNA positivity. Post-operative absence or persistence of ctDNA was related to the radicality of the surgical treatment and the ctDNA levels were concordant with the response to adjuvant chemotherapy.

Methods', ' Retrospective analysis to evaluate the concordance of tissue and plasma RAS determination for assessing eligibility for anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC patients. RAS mutations were also analyzed in serial plasma samples in selected patients. Plasma mutations were determined with Sysmex Inostics BEAMing34 RAS mutation panel and compared to standard-of-care (SOC) RAS testing in tissue samples. Detectable mutation cutoff for BEAMing was standardized for each codon and was 2% for SOC. In cases with discordant tissue-plasma results tissue samples were re-examined by BEAMing. Results', ' 38 treatment nave mCRC patients with known RAS status in tissue sample were analyzed. Results showed a concordance of 89.5% (34/38 patients) (table). Among two patients in which a RAS mutation was identified in plasma but not in tissue, one patient was treated with anti-EGFR therapy and did not respond. In the other case, the mutation was detected in tissue by BEAMing re-examination and the patient was subsequently treated with anti-VEGF achieving a partial response. In one of two cases in which a RAS mutation was detected in tissue but not in plasma the re-analysis of RAS status by BEAMing in tissue confirmed the same NRAS codon 61 mutation detected by SOC. Analysis of RAS mutations in serial plasma samples from 5 selected patients that progressed to anti-EGFR, showed emergence of RAS mutations in 2 patients (40%) at the time of relapse. Conclusions', ' The high overall concordance between tissue and plasma BEAMing extended RAS determination supports the blood-based RAS mutation testing to determinate the eligibility of CRC patients for anti-EGFR treatment. The detection of RAS mutations in plasma at progression to anti-EGFR suggests that BEAMing 34 RAS mutation panel may be used to monitor resistance and anticipate treatment options.

The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive role of EGFR GCN in RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wt metastatic colorectal cancer. Methods', ' The patient material included 102 patients with KRAS exon 2 wt metastatic colorectal cancer treated with anti-EGFR antibodies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used for KRAS exons 2, 3 and 4, NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4, BRAF and PIK3CA gene mutation analyses from primary tumor tissue samples. EGFR GCN was analyzed by EGFR IHC guided automated silver ISH (GCN cutoff 4.0). Results', 'RAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA gene mutation analyses were successfully performed for 86.3% of the patients.

EGFR GCN was  4.0 in a majority of the RAS wt patients (40/63, 63.5%). An elevated EGFR GCN predicted a better response to anti-EGFR therapy and prolonged PFS in the RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wt patients. In addition, most RAS wt patients with an EGFR GCN  4.0 in their primary tumors benefited of anti-EGFR therapy in terms of clinical benefit (SD, PR or CR) (Chi-Square Test, p = 0.0005), and had a longer progression free survival than those with a EGFR GCN below 4.0 (Log-Rank Test, p < 0.0001). In contrast, the response RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wt, EGFR GCN below 4.0 patients did not differ from patients with mutant in RAS, or BRAF or PIK3CA. Conclusions', ' The study indicates that EGFR GCN serves as a predictive marker for anti-EGFR treatment efficacy in patients with RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wtmetastatic colorectal cancer.

Hence our main objective is to assess correlation between various modifiable risk factors and CIMP status among metastatic colorectal cancer patients.Methods', ' We characterized CIMP methylation (MINT1, MINT2, MINT31, p14, p16, and MLH1) in 229 metastatic colorectal cancer patients using PCR amplification of bisulfite treated DNA followed by pyrosequencing.

Associations of demographic and clinical characteristics, including BMI, diabetes, obesity, physical activity, smoking and drinking status, as well as presence or absence of other molecular alterations (BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and PTEN loss) with overall survival were assessed in multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.Results', 'When treating methylation as a continuous variable, patients with BRAF mutation had higher methylation as compared to participants with BRAF wildtype (40.6% vs 20.5%, p = 0.001). White, non-Hispanic (WNH) patients had greater degree of tumor methylation (24.8%) as compared to other racial categories (p = 0.02).

Up to 1 g of DNA (minimum, 0.2 g) was used for library preparation using liquid-phase cRNA capture probes targeting all exons of BRAF, CTNNB1, CHIC2, CSF1R, DNMT3A, EGFR, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KIT, KRAS, MAPK1, MAP2K2, MET, NPM1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, PTPN11, RET, RUNX1, TP53, and WT1 (302 kb). Libraries were sequenced by Illumina technology to obtain 101bp or 150bp paired-end reads. Mean coverage was 1596; 50x depth was achieved at >95% of positions. The analysis pipeline was validated for variant allele frequency >10%. Variants were called and interpreted using the Clinical Genomicist Workstation. A list of clinically actionable variants (hot spots) was curated by literature review. Of 210 cases, 94 (45%) were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 20 (9.5%) were pancreatic cancer (PCA), and 17 (8.1%) were colorectal cancer (CRC), the balance representing 38 diverse other malignancies. FFPE tissue cores yielded a median of 2.4 g DNA (interquartile range 1.0-4.9 g). Sequencing identified a mean of 5.4 non-synonymous coding and/or splice site variants per case (single-nucleotide variants and indels). Of these, a mean of 2.8/case were not known polymorphisms and likely represented somatic mutations. Somatic variants most commonly occurred in TP53 (233 variants in 107 cases), KRAS (52 variants in 51 cases), and EGFR (40 variants in 33 cases). Sequencing identified 74 clinically actionable (i.e., predictive or prognostic) mutations in 61/210 = 29% of cases. In NSCLC, actionable mutations were present in KRAS codon 12 (29/94 cases), EGFR exons 19 (5 cases), 20 (1 case) and 21 (5 cases), and the PIK3CA helical domain (4 cases). In PCA, there were no variants currently recognized as actionable, but one potentially targetable MET T1010I variant was found. In CRC, actionable mutations were present in KRAS codon 12 or 13 (6/17 cases), PIK3CA (3 cases) and KIT (1 case). Average turnaround time was 29 days.

The strongly inhibited kinases subsequent to RAF kinases appeared to be CSF1R (44nM), DDR1 (77nM) and DDR2 (182 nM).HM95573 potently inhibited the growth of BRAFmutation CRC cell lines (e.g. IC50', ' 118nM for Colo-205) and thyroid cancer cell lines (43nM for B-CPAP); KRAS mutation NSCLC cell lines(297nM for Calu-6),CRC cell lines(65nM for HCT-116) and thyroid cancer cell lines(479nM for CAL-62); and NRAS mutation HCC cell lines(28nM for HepG2) andleukemia cell lines (39nM for HL-60). HM95573 effectively inhibited the phosphorylations of MEK and ERK, downstream kinases associated with cell proliferation in tumor cell lines mutated in BRAF, KRAS and NRAS. In addition, the phosphorylation of downstream kinases of RAF such as MEK and ERK was effectively inhibited with treatment of HM95573 in mutant KRAS NSCLC and CRC cells.HM95573 showed the excellent antitumor activity in mouse models xenografted with BRAF mutation cell line (Colo-205), KRAS mutation cell lines (Calu-6 and HCT-116)and NRAS mutation cell line (HepG2)two RAF inhibitors approved in melanoma which were effective to only BRAF mutation cell lines under conditions tested. The in vivo antitumor activity of HM95573 was potentiated with MEK inhibitors.Now, HM95573 is currently in phase I development in patients with advanced solid tumors including KRAS mutation NSCLC in Korea.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Several studies have reported that right-sided colon cancers (RCC) and left-sided colon cancers (LCC) differ in several factors including genetic features. We investigated the difference in clinicopathological characteristics and oncogenic mutation status between patients with RCC and LCC in all stages. Methods', ' This study was a prospective, observational study. Patients were recruited from December 2014 to February 2016. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected and DNA wes extracted from tissue sections from 158 cases. Mutations in KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, BRAF and PIK3CAwere detected by next-generation DNA sequencer. Tumors from cecum to transverse colon were defined as RCC, and tumors from descending colon to rectsigmoid were defined as LCC. Results', ' RCC was 66 patients and LCC was 92 patients. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or mutinous adenocarcinoma were significantly more frequent in RCC compared to LCC (P = 0.047). KRAS mutations were detected in 35 patients with RCC (53.0%) and in 32 patients with LCC (34.8%). NRAS mutations were detected in 2 patients with RCC (3.0%) and in 3 patients with LCC (3.3%). There was no HRAS mutation in all patients. BRAF mutations were detected in 7 patient with RCC (10.6%) and in 2 patients with LCC (2.2%). PIK3CA mutations were detected in 8 patients with RCC (12.1%) and in 10 patients with LCC (10.9%). KRAS and BRAF mutation in RCC were significantly more frequent than in LCC (P = 0.022 and P = 0.024, respectively). These mutations were not significantly different according to tumor stage. In this study, both KRAS and BRAFmutations were exclusive. Conclusions', 'KRAS and BRAF mutation were more frequent in the patients with RCC compared to those with LCC in all stages. This study suggested that it was important to evaluate BRAF mutation in addition to KRAS in order to select more effective treatments, especially in RCC.']",

        "Background":"['CRCs arise through genetic changes that impact various driver genes and in some tumors increased mutation rate in microsatellite unstable tumors. The hypermutable phenotype associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) results from loss of the mismatch repair system (MMR) activity. MSI is detected in 15% of all CRCs, and such tumors have a better prognosis and different chemotherapeutic outcome patterns, including high clinical benefit from immune checkpoint therapy or relative resistance to 5-FU as compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays an essential role in carcinogenesis of CRCs and is known to be overexpressed in MSI CRCs while highly mutated in Lung cancer. We analyzed the mutation frequency of deregulated pathways including EGFR and its downstream genes KRAS and BRAF in CRCs. We found a significantly elevated EGFR mutation frequency in CRC MSI-H subtype (45.5% vs. 6.5% in MSS CRCs, p<0.0000001). Although KRAS and NRAS are mutated with high frequency in both MSI-H and MSS groups, BRAF corresponding to RTK-RAS pathways is more altered in MSI-H than MSS CRCs (32.67% vs 13.10%; p=0.001), consistent with the known association between MSI-H CRCs and BRAF mutations. We hypothesized that there might be a mutation pattern in EGFR in CRC subtypes that provide a rationale for EGFR-targeted therapy for a subtype of CRC. Of 1104 profiled CRCs in the COSMIC v73 database, somatic EGFR mutations were mapped for 101 MSI-High versus 916 MSS CRCs. EGFR mutations mapped on the protein structure revealed that mutations are mainly targeting tyrosine kinase (TK) domain while the extracellular domain remained mostly wild-type with potential for targeting by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. It is known that downstream genes such as KRAS as well as expression levels of EGFR ligands can affect the sensitivity of CRCs to anti-EGFR therapy. We didn’t detect any difference in mRNA expression level between MSI-H and MSS group but our analysis is indicative of the presence of G12D mutations in a high proportion of KRAS-mutated MSS CRCs, therefore resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab would be expected. However, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib could be considered for further testing in patients with MSI-H tumors that have a lower frequency of G12D KRAS mutations and may have mutant EGFR.']",
