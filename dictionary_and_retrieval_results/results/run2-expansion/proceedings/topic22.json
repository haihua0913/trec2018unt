Here, we evaluated the importance of adding TBI to the adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in a randomized fashion. Methods', ' 101 patients with metastatic melanoma, including 76 with M1c disease, were randomly assigned to receive nonmyeloablative chemotherapy with or without 1200 cGy TBI prior to transfer of TIL. The primary endpoints were complete response rate (as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0) and overall survival. Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed for correlates of response. Results', ' Complete response rates were 24% in both groups (12/50 v 12/51) and overall survival was also similar (median OS, 38.2 v 36.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.91, P= .71). Thrombotic microangiopathy was an adverse event unique to the TBI arm and occurred in 13/48 treated patients. With a median potential follow-up of 40.9 months, only one of the 24 complete responders recurred.

Although many human cancers such as melanoma express tumor antigens recognized by T cells, host immune responses often fail to control tumor growth for mostly unexplained reasons. Escaping immune destruction is one of the tenets of tumorigenesis; there have been several studies suggesting an important role of PD-1/PD-L1 (B7-H1) interactions in inhibiting the effector functions of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte in tumor. Ghebeh et al., reported that doxorubicin treatment caused decrease in cytosolic B7-H1 and increased nuclear translocalization in breast carcinoma (Breast Cancer Res. 2010;12(4)', 'R48). It is unknown whether differential cellular expression of PD-L1 contributes to the pathogenesis of melanoma. To address the role of PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1 in different stages of malignant melanoma, we have performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 and PD-1 in benign nevi (n=59), primary melanomas without metastasis (n=22) or with metastasis (n=17), and melanoma metastases (n=32 cases). Benign nevi had significantly higher levels of nuclear PD-L1 immunopositivity (p=0.004) and low levels of PD-1 protein expression (p=0.002). With progression from benign nevi to primary melanoma there was an increase in cytoplasmic positivity for PD-L1 (p=0.03). Also, a significant positive correlation was observed between the percentage of positive cells (p=0.0007) and intensity (p=0.0009) for PD-1 in primary melanomas. Although there was no significant difference in PD-1 levels in between primaries with or without metastasis, a trend was observed for PD-L1 expression', ' primaries with metastasis having a larger number of tumor cells with cytosolic localization than primaries without metastasis (p=0.07). Interestingly, primary melanomas without metastasis showed significantly larger number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) cells having intense immunoreactivity for PD-L1 protein than did metastatic melanomas (p=0.03). In conclusion, differential cellular localization of PD-L1 protein and high levels of PD-1 protein correlates with disease progression and high-risk histologic features in melanoma and might partially explain the resistance of melanoma cells against the immune system.']",

We determined the prevalence of OX40+ activated T lymphocytes, FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, DC-LAMP+ mature dendritic cells (DCs) and CD123+ plasmacytoid DCs by immunohistochemistry in 100 SLNs from 60 melanoma patients. Density values of each cell type in SLNs were compared to those in non-sentinel nodes obtained from block dissections (n=37), and analyzed with regard to associations with clinicopathological parameters and disease outcome. Sentinel nodes showed elevated amount of all cell types studied in comparison to non-sentinel nodes. Metastatic SLNs had higher density of OX40+ lymphocytes compared to tumor-negative nodes, while no significant difference was observed in the case of the other cell types studied. Within the sentinel-positive group, FOXP3+ cell density was higher in patients showing disease progression and >5 years survival than in those without progression and <5 years survival, respectively, or in sentinel-negative cases. High amount of FOXP3+ cells in SLNs was associated with shorter progression-free (P=0.0203) and overall survival (P=0.0238), while no significant correlation was found in the case of the other immune cell types. In multivariate analysis, SLN status, ulceration, Breslow index and patient gender, but not the density values of the immune cell types, proved significant independent predictors of survival. Taken together, our results are compatible with the hypothesis of functional competence of sentinel lymph nodes based on the prevalence of the studied immune cells. The density of FOXP3+ lymphocytes showed association with progression and survival, but none of the immune markers emerged as independent prognostic factor. These results, together with our previous findings on the prognostic value of activated T cells and mature DCs infiltrating primary melanomas, suggest that immune cells residing in the primary tumor, rather than those in sentinel lymph nodes, may be crucial in the development of antitumor immune response reflected in influencing the outcome of the disease.

Preexisting lymphocytic infiltration of tumors has emerged as an important biomarker predictive of clinical benefit, suggesting that therapeutic effect could be enhanced through strategies that induce tumor inflammation.

Methods', '  For our studies we utilized Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), an avian virus with robust type I IFN-inducing properties. Metastatic disease was modeled by using bilateral flank B16 mouse melanoma model, with NDV administered unilaterally, allowing us to characterize the immune responses in both virus-injected and distant tumors. Therapeutic efficacy and immune responses utilizing intratumoral NDV with systemic immune checkpoint blocking antibodies were further characterized in several mouse models.  Results', '  Localized intratumoral therapy of B16 melanoma with NDV induced CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytic infiltrates and anti-tumor effect in distant (non-virally infected) tumors without viral spread to these sites. Combination therapy with localized NDV and systemic immune checkpoint blockade led to distant tumor rejection in both NDV-susceptible and resistant tumor models and protected the animals from tumor re-challenge. This effect was associated with marked tumor infiltration with activated effector, but not regulatory T cells, and was dependent on CD8 and NK cells, and type I and II interferons. To further enhance the T cell effector function in tumors, we genetically-engineered NDVs expressing co-stimulatory ligands and demonstrated further increase in therapeutic efficacy of the combination therapy in several tumor models.  Conclusions', '  In summary, in mouse tumor models, localized therapy with NDV induces inflammatory infiltrates in distant tumors, making them susceptible to systemic therapy with immunomodulatory antibodies.

In melanoma patients, it has been observed that higher number of TH1 cells in the tumour micro-environment lead to better prognosis. In this study, using an autochthonous zebrafish melanoma model, when we forced the expression of interferon gamma (IFNg) locally in the tumour microenvironment, thereby potentially enhancing TH1 differentiation, we observed an inflammatory response against melanoma that eventually lead to complete tumour regression.Using transposon mediated BAC transgenesis, we have generated a Tg(cd4', 'mcherry) reporter line labelling CD4+ cells in zebrafish. By driving Human NRASQ61L in zebrafish melanocytes we have modelled melanoma in zebrafish and later when these fish developed tumours we forced the expression of IFNg in melanoma cells using a tamoxifen inducible LSL/CreERT2 system driven by mitfa minimal promoter. Experiments were performed using animals with and without CreERT2. Following tamoxifen administration, we observed a loss of pigmentation in all the IFNg induced tumours (n = 12) by 2 weeks post induction which gradually increased over the study period. Whereas no loss of pigmentation was observed in control tumours (n = 12) throughout the study period. At 9 weeks post induction, the study was terminated and tumours were analysed using histology. In tumours were IFNg was induced, we observed that the tumour tissue was now replaced with fibrotic tissue accompanied by a marked lymphocyte infiltration and patches of necrosis. However, new tumour nodules were also observed to develop in the vicinity of regressing nodules which are unpigmented and potentially hypo-immunogenic. We observed no signs of tumour regression in control tumours.Although preliminary, our data is very exciting and promising as it will open new avenues for developing combinatorial therapies in melanoma.

The human high molecular weight melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA), a membrane-bound protein over-expressed in > 90% of melanomas, is thought to contribute to melanoma growth and metastasis. A number of studies indicate the merit of blocking these tumor-promoting functions by antibodies. Most antibodies for cancer therapy in clinical use belong to the IgG class, the most prevalent class in blood. IgE antibodies, characterised for their role in allergic responses and protection against parasites, function through high-affinity Fc receptors. IgE antibodies, naturally reside in tissues where they exert immunological surveillance, a different spectrum of effector cells, and offer a novel therapeutic approach by targeting solid tumors such as melanoma. Previous studies, suggest that IgE antibodies are more effective than the corresponding IgGs in eliciting anti-tumural immune responses, with our lead antibody candidate against the tumour antigen Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) presently in clinical development. We wished to elucidate whether this concept can be applied to the treatment of melanoma. To test this, we engineered IgG1, IgG4 and IgE antibodies of the same specificity against HMW-MAA and examined their functionality in activating immune effector cells against cancer cells. IgG1 and IgE antibodies induced significant tumor cell death by two mechanisms', ' antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, using patient-derived monocytes and monocytes from healthy volunteers.

Furthermore, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of these antibodies in tumor-bearing NOD/SCID/IL-2 receptor  chain-/- mice engrafted with human lymphocytes. We demonstrate, that IgE antibodies are superior compared to IgG1 (p<0.05) and non-specific antibody controls (p<0.001).

Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) have proven effective for immunotherapy of melanoma. CTLA-4 is up-regulated post-T cell activation and blockade enhances tumor responses in immunocompetent rodents and humans. Trials suggest that combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors are more efficacious than single agents, but tumors remain resistant. We are investigating CD47 blockade for the treatment of cancer. CD47 is frequently elevated in cancers and serves as an inhibitory receptor for thrombospondin-1 on immune cells in the tumor stroma. CD47 blockade on CD8 T or tumor cells significantly enhances immune-targeted tumor cell killing post-IR compared to IR alone. Here we explore the potential for antisense CD47 and anti-CTLA4 therapy alone or in combination with IR using a syngeneic mouse melanoma model. Methods', ' C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 1x106B16F10 melanoma cells in the hind limb and treated with 10 Gy IR combined with CTLA4 blocking antibody, CD47 translational blocking morpholino, or the combination of CTLA4/CD47 therapies. Granzyme B along with CD4/CD8 T cell infiltration were examined in tumors. Histology was evaluated for CD3 and necrosis. Results', ' The combination of CD47/CTLA4 with IR significantly increased survival by 25% compared to IR/CTLA4 alone at 50 days. Granzyme B expression was significantly increased in IR mice with CTLA4/CD47 combination, which correlated with infiltration of CD8+ T cells and a concomitant decrease in Gr1+CD11b suppressor cells compared to controls. In non-IR tumors, histology revealed minimal necrosis, while all IR groups showed increased necrosis. Tumor IR in combination with CTLA4 or CD47 increased immune cell infiltration. However, the combination of IR with CTLA4/CD47 showed widespread necrosis. All groups treated with the CD47 exhibited focal hemorrhage, which was more extensive when combined with CTLA4.

        "Background":"['Adoptive cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is a promising immunotherapeutic approach and has resulted in durable response rates of 20-30% in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, several limitations exist to prevent the widespread implementation of adoptive cell therapy, including inadequate infiltration of tumor-specific T cells into tumors and anemic expansion of tumor-specific T cells in vitro. One such factor is PD-1 expression on T cells that plays an important role in T cell exhaustion. Agonistic co-stimulatory molecules such as 4-1BB which is transiently expressed on activated T cells can reverse T cell exhaustion and enhance anti-tumor immune response. In this study, we have examined two approaches to improve the frequency of tumor-specific T cells in tumors and TIL cultures. First, we examined whether blocking PD-L1/PD-1 signaling increased the infiltration of tumor-specific T cells in the murine B16 melanoma model. Mice bearing B16 tumors were treated with NrIgG or anti-PD-1 antibodies. T cells were isolated from B16 tumors on day 18 after tumor injection. Increased IFN- production following B16 restimulation was observed in TIL isolated from mice treated with anti-PD-1 antibody (1445  48 pg/ml) compared to TIL isolated from mice treated with control antibody (748  25 pg/ml, p<0.001). In addition, we examined whether the expansion of T cells during TIL culture in vitro could be augmented by targeting the co-stimulatory molecule, 4-1BB. T cells were isolated from B16 tumors and cultured in vitro with 10 mcg/mL anti-4-1BB antibody. After 5 days, increased B16-specific IFN- was measured in TIL cultured with anti-4-1BB antibody (1865  64 pg/ml, p<0.001 compared to TIL cultured with control antibody). Combination treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy in vivo and anti-4-1BB antibody in vitro demonstrated synergistic effects, with increased levels of IFN- (4440  486 pg/ml) produced by B16-specific TIL. These findings suggest that anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in combination with in vitro 4-1BB antibody treatment can enhance the frequency of tumor-specific T cells isolated from B16 melanoma. This may represent a potential strategy to increase the effectiveness of TIL therapy in patients with melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma delivers immune suppressive stimuli through PDL-1. FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is an immunophilin capable of immune suppression. We, previously, demonstrated a relevant role for this protein in melanoma biology and progression. Melanoma also expresses a splicing variant of FKBP51 (isoform 2 or ISO2), whose function is unknown. Aim of this study was to generate knowledge on the mechanism regulating PDL-1 expression in melanoma, and find biomarkers predictive of response to immunotherapy. We generated melanoma cells overexpressing the canonical FKBP51 or ISO2, and measured levels of PDL-1. Flow cytometry showed that expression of PDL1 in ISO2-melanoma (41.5+4.2%) was significantly higher than expression in control cells (15.5+4.7%) or melanoma overexpressing the canonical FKBP51 (23.2+5.7%). These results suggested a role for ISO2 in regulation of PDL-1 expression, that was confirmed in another tumor cell line, namely HeLa. Western blot assay showed different bands of PDL-1 (around 70kD, 50kD and 37kD). The band at 70kD was present in the tumor, but not in lymphocytes and, reasonably, corresponded to the form exposed on the membrane. This 70kD band was particularly upregulated in ISO2-melanoma. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) express a strong immunohistochemistry signal for FKBP51. Since a molecular mimicry suits melanoma and lymphocytes, we investigated whether PBMCs of melanoma patients, that are a good a source of TIL, expressed the two isoforms. We measured, by QPCR, isoforms levels in PBMCs of 70 healthy donors, 92 primary melanoma and 60 metastatic melanoma patients. Our results show that expression of ISO2, but not canonical FKBP51, was significantly higher in PBMCs of patients than in PBMCs of controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.0001). In addition, ISO2 expression in PBMCs from metastatic melanoma patients (range 7.0-36.0 au) was significantly higher than expression in PBMCs from primary melanoma (range 1.0-3.5 au)(p<0-007). Healthy donors PBMCs expressed ISO2 when cocultured with melanoma and such expression changed in accordance with PDL-1 expression on melanoma, as suggested by PDL-1 knockdown experiments. Moreover, ISO2 resulted increased in PBMCs cultured with PDL-1 recombinant protein, but not BSA. These findings suggested that the increased expression of ISO2 in PBMCs of melanoma patients was stimulated by the interaction between the tumor and PBMCs, through PDL-1/PD1. In conclusion, our results show that 1) ISO2, a splicing variant of FKBP51, upregulates expression of PDL1 in melanoma; 2) PDL1-PD1 interaction between tumor and lymphocytes induces ISO2 in lymphocytes; 3) increased ISO2 levels were measured in PBMCs of 152 melanoma patients; 4) ISO2 levels were especially high in PBMCs of advanced melanoma patients. Collectively, our results suggest ISO2 is a promising melanoma biomarker related to PDL-1.']",

The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 receptor on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) between metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM) and metastatic cutaneous melanoma (MCM). Methods', ' Biopsy specimens of MUM and MCM patients were analyzed for PD-L1 and PD-1 expression at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences).

Results', ' Overall, 22/106 (20.8%) MCM specimens expressed PD-L1 (Table). The highest rate of expression was seen in lung metastasis.

Correlation strength was assessed using Spearman’s rho statistics. Multiple testing was addressed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and FDR control at 5%. MutSig 1 (clock-like, age-related) showed significant positive correlations with immune cell infiltrations in low-grade gliomas, negative correlations in breast cancer, melanoma, stomach cancer, lung and prostate adenocarcinoma, but no significant correlations in the remaining 15 cancer types. Of the two APOBEC-related signatures, MutSig 2 showed positive significant correlations with immune cell infiltrates in cervical cancer, bladder cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, head and neck cancer and thyroid cancer, MutSig 13 in breast and cervical cancer. In particular, correlation of MutSig 2 with cytotoxic lymphocytes was significant in cervical cancer, bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (R = 0.29, R= 0.17 and R = 0.17), the corresponding correlation of MutSig 13 in breast cancer (R = 0.17). MutSig 4 (tobacco smoke-related) showed a positive significant correlation with CD8+ T cells and NK cells in lung adenocarcinoma (R = 0.15 and R = 0.14). In contrast, correlation of MutSig 4 with immune cell infiltrates was non-significant or negative in head and neck cancer. In colorectal cancer, MutSig 6 (defective mismatch repair) showed significant positive correlations with NK cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, monocytic lineage cells and neutrophils infiltration (R = 0.45, R = 0.37, R = 0.23 and R = 0.19). PD-L1 mRNA expression and immune cell infiltrates correlated positively in all 21 cancer types. In particular, correlation with monocytic lineage cells was positive and significant in all cancer types and strong (R > 0.50) in 12 cancer types. Correlation with T cells was positive and significant in 18 cancer types and strong in 10 cancer types. In summary, pan-cancer analysis of DNA and RNAseq data showed that specific mutational signatures contribute to cancer cell immunogenicity, while the ubiquitous clock-like mutational process did not positively correlate with immune cell infiltrates in 20 of 21 cancer types. Moreover, PD-L1 mRNA expression strongly correlated with infiltrates of immune cells in the majority of cancer types.']",

Antibody-mediated blockade of ICPs can lead to durable responses in patients. Interestingly, only a small subset of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) express these checkpoints and there is a need to better understand the characteristics of this subset. We undertook this study to understand characteristics of TILs within melanoma. Methods', ' We used single cell mass cytometry, gene expression profiling of purified T cell subsets, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing as well as functional studies to understand the characteristics of TILs in melanoma patients (n=50). We also performed exome sequencing of tumor cells in some patients. Results', ' We find that TILs are functionally and phenotypically distinct from circulating T cells. They express higher levels of inhibitory ICPs (PD-1, TIM-3) and secrete less IL2, IFNg and TNFa than T cells in circulation. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor within tumors correlated with reduced T cell infiltration. Expression of ICPs (PD-1, TIM-3, PD-L1) were enriched in T cells with a phenotype and expression profile of tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells with most cells expressing multiple checkpoints. Within the myeloid compartment, ICPs were predominantly expressed on CD14+CD16+ subset. TCR sequencing revealed that individual melanoma metastases revealed that the top clones within each of the lesions have distinct TCRs. Concurrent TCR and tumor exome sequencing of individual metastases in the same patient revealed that inter-lesional diversity of TCRs exceeded differences in mutation/neoantigen load in tumor cells. Conclusions', ' Our findings suggest that TRM cells and CD16+ myeloid cells may be the major target of ICP blockade within tumors. The ability to activate, and retain TRM cells may be an important determinant of the T cell content of the tumor microenvironment and should be a goal for future vaccines.

Recently, we observed that dasatinib induces a rapid (within one hour after oral administration) and marked mobilization of lymphocytes (up to 8-fold increase in lymphocyte count), which closely follows the drug plasma concentration. In addition, in a subgroup of patients a clonal expansion of large granular lymphocytes occurs, which is correlated with good therapy response.As dasatinib-induced immunomodulatory effects are not leukemia specific, we aimed to exploit this activity to slow down or inhibit the growth of a syngeneic murine melanoma model and to characterize in detail the anti-tumor immune responses.Ovalbumin expressing murine melanoma cell line B16.OVA was grown under the skin of immunocompetent mice. The mice (n=6/group) were treated daily i.g. either with 30 mg/kg dasatinib or vehicle only. Blood was collected before tumor transplantation, before treatment, and on treatment days 4, 7 and 10. Tumor volumes were measured manually and specific growth rate was calculated based on the first and the last day of the treatment. In addition to white blood cell differential counts, immunophenotyping of blood and tumor homogenate was done by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD45.1, CD3, CD4, CD8b and NK1.1, and SIINFEKL-pentamer to detect B16.OVA-specific cells. To assess the functional properties of lymphocytes, we used antibodies against immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA-4 and PD-1, and a degranulation marker CD107.On the 10th day of treatment, the tumor volumes were smaller in dasatinib group compared to control group, and there was a significant decrease in the tumor growth rate (0.06 vs. 0.18, p=0.01). Furthermore, dasatinib treated mice had increased proportion of CD8+ cells in the circulation (21% vs. 14%, p=0.04) and the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly decreased (1.39 vs. 1.52, p= 0.04). During the tumor growth the mean CTLA-4 expression on CD8+ cells increased from 1.2% to 9% in the control group, whereas, in dasatinib group the increase was more modest (1.2% to 5.7%). Interestingly, 80% of tumor infiltrating CD8+ cells expressed PD1 antigen compared to <5% of PD1 positive CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood suggesting lymphocyte anergy or exhaustion induced by tumor cells.To conclude, dasatinib treatment slowed down the tumor growth in B16.OVA mouse model, which could be associated with the immunomodulatory effects of dasatinib. However, combinatorial treatment regimens may be needed as dasatinib is not able to fully break the immune cell anergy induced by tumor cells.']",

The goal of the present study is to better understand the molecular and immune heterogeneity in synchronous melanoma metastases at the time of disease progression. In this study, we prospectively evaluated 32 tumors from 15 patients who were treatment-nave (n = 4), or had received prior targeted (n = 4) or immunotherapy (n = 7). Whole exome sequencing demonstrated between 4-41% of non-synonymous exonic mutations (NSEM) were restricted to individual tumors within a patient. Deep profiling of infiltrating immune cell subsets by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed the immune infiltrate between synchronous metastases to be highly heterogeneous, specifically in regards to CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. In aggregate, 92% of these T cell clones were unique to distinct tumors within the same patient, with limited overlap with clones detected in the blood. NetMHC3.4 neoantigen prediction demonstrated a large fraction of predicted neoantigens were restricted to individual tumors, with over 10% of these presenting extremely high predicted affinity. Importantly, analysis of RECIST measurements of individual lesions within the same patient suggested this molecular and immune heterogeneity could contribute to differential tumor growth and response to therapy within the same patient.

Vaccines fusing MIP-3α to gp100 have been shown to be effective in therapeutically alleviating melanoma in mouse models. Other studies have provided evidence that IL-10 neutralizing antibodies enhance immunological melanoma therapies by modulating the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment. Here, we report that neutralizing IL-10 enhances the therapeutic anti-melanoma efficacy of a MIP-3α-gp100 DNA vaccine. The current studies utilize the B16F10 syngeneic mouse melanoma model system. The MIP-3α-gp100 DNA vaccine is administered intramuscularly (i.m.) into the tibialis muscle, followed immediately by i.m. electroporation. The standard therapeutic protocol was the following', ' challenge with lethal dose of B16F10 cells (5x104) on day 0; vaccinate with 50μg vaccine plasmid on days 3, 10, and 17; and administer 150μg of αIL10 antibody intra-tumorally beginning on day 5, once every three days for up to six doses. Tumor sizes, growth, and survival were all assessed. Treatment responses were characterized by flow cytometric analysis of tumor infiltrate. Vaccine-specific T-cells were delineated by gp10025-33 stimulation followed by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ and assessment by flow cytometry. The mechanism of αIL-10 efficacy was explored by RT-PCR and confirmed with a knockout mouse model. With this therapeutic protocol, we demonstrate for the first time that a therapy neutralizing IL-10 additively enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of a MIP-3α-gp100 vaccine, leading to significantly smaller tumors, slower growing tumors, and overall increases in mouse survival. Surprisingly, the additive effects of αIL-10 were not shown to be directly mediated by any T-cell parameter tested, including vaccine-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), total TILs of either CD4+ or CD8+ subset, regulatory T-cells, granzyme positive T-cells, and others. We discovered, however, that IFNα-4 transcripts in the tumor were significantly upregulated in mice given vaccine and αIL-10 compared to vaccine alone. Furthermore, infiltration into the tumor of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, known to be professional IFNα-producing cells, were enhanced with the combination therapy. A mouse model with IFNαR1 knocked out eliminated the protection provided by αIL-10, demonstrating that the additional therapeutic value of αIL-10 is primarily mediated by type-I interferons. In conclusion, efficient targeting of antigen to immature dendritic cells with a chemokine fusion vaccine offers a potential alternative approach to the ex vivo dendritic cell antigen loading protocols currently undergoing clinical investigation. Combining this approach with an IL-10 neutralizing antibody therapy that modulates the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment offers promise as a novel melanoma therapy.']",

CD8+ TILs downregulate CD226, supporting an imbalance of TIGIT/CD226 expression in metastatic melanoma. TIGIT is a marker of early T cell activation, which is further upregulated by T cells upon PD-1 blockade and by dysfunctional PD-1+Tim-3+ TA-specific CD8+ T cells. PD-1+TIGIT+, PD-1TIGIT+ and PD-1+ TIGIT CD8+ TILs exhibit similar functional capacities ex vivo, suggesting that TIGIT upregulation alone or together with PD-1 is not a marker of T cell dysfunction. However, in the presence of TIGIT ligand-expressing cells, TIGIT blockade adds to PD-1 blockade to increase the proliferation, cytokine production and degranulation of TA-specific CD8+ T cells and CD8+ TILs. Collectively, our findings show that TIGIT together with PD-1 regulate the expansion and function of TA-specific CD8+ T cells and CD8+TILs in melanoma patients.

The present study thoroughly examines the functional relevance of miR-126 in melanoma progression and suggests a central role of this miRNA as prognostic marker and modulator of the melanoma microenvironment. Initially, the expression of miR-126 was quantified in two independent, isogenic cell line model series of melanoma progression. To further explore its functional role, two stable over-expression cell lines were generated and subjected to an extensive series of in vitro assays. Subsequently, the prognostic relevance of miR-126 was assessed via in situ hybridization on a large melanoma tissue microarray cohort. In both melanoma cell line systems, miR-126 expression was inversely correlated with the level of tumorigenicity. Over-expression of miR-126 in vitro resulted in a significant decrease in colony formation, both in the presence and absence of anchorage, while cell viability remained unaffected. Using a three-dimensional spheroid invasion assay, over-expression of miR-126 significantly reduced cell invasiveness. In addition, a substantial reduction in tumor cell adhesion to VCAM-1 coated micro-channels was observed when the adhesive capacity of miR-126 over-expressing cells was examined under shear stress using the Cellix's Microfluidic Platform. Using in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays containing melanoma tissue, miR-126 expression was evident in the tumor vasculature whereas melanoma cells did not appear to express miR-126. Analysis of the degree of vascular staining revealed a significant association between lower vascular miR-126 expression and lower T-stage. In addition, high vascular miR-126 scores were significantly associated with prolonged overall survival, in particular in high grade tumors (T-stages 3 and 4). Overall, miR-126 over-expression was shown to trigger a less aggressive phenotype in melanoma cells in vitro. Nonetheless, its clinical relevance in melanoma may primarily be mediated by the tumor vasculature. Depletion of miR-126 has previously been linked to a number of tumor relevant phenotypes, including inflammation. Vascular up-regulation of the miR-126 target protein VCAM-1 may mediate increased tumor infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, which are known to play a crucial role in tumor development and prognosis.

Due to the evolution of treatment options for metastatic melanoma with heavy reliance on immunomodulatory therapies, we sought to re-evaluate responses in the era of checkpoint blockade. Methods', ' Pts receive treatment consisting of 7 days of lymphodepleting chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. High dose interleukin-2 (720,000 IU/kg IV q 8 hrs up to 15 doses) was infused after TIL infusion. Responses were assessed by imaging per irRC. Results', ' A total of 74 pts have been treated in our initial TIL study with an updated ORR assessment of 43%. Stratification of pts according to their checkpoint blockade immune-modulator therapy prior to TIL ACT, demonstrated that prior Ipilimumab (Ipi) decreased ORR to 33% compared to 51% in checkpoint nave pts and decreased overall survival (OS) post-TIL therapy (median 7.7 vs 24.6 months respectively). There were too few pts to assess the impact of anti-PD1 as a single agent. A multiparametric analysis revealed that LDH levels at the time of therapy mainly influences OS and ORR to TIL but still could not invalidate the impact of Ipi prior to TIL ACT. The durability of the response was also found to be different between the 2 groups (30% for Ipi prior and 50% No Ipi prior). This new reality also impacted previously reported parameters that correlated with ORR to TIL ACT such as the expression of B-and-T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) on CD8+ TIL. Interestingly, assessment of mutation load (ML) of the tumors prior to TIL ACT showed that the check point nave group display a high ML ( > 100) within their tumor whereas some patients who had Ipi prior to TIL have a low ML ( < 100). Conclusions', ' Our preliminary analysis shows that pre-treatment with Ipi decreases ORR to TIL ACT.

Methods', '  A prospectively-enrolled cohort of patients presenting with stage III melanoma at NYU was studied. Associations between age at diagnosis and presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), response to immunotherapy, and stage IV progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were tested by log rank test. In addition, checkpoint PD-L1 expression was tested in pre-treatment tumor specimens in a subset of patients.  Results', '  316 patients (median follow-up for survivors', ' 45 months) were studied and categorized into two groups by age at diagnosis', ' 60 years (n=163) and >60 years (n=153).

No significant survival differences were observed among patients who received non-immunotherapy treatments (n=57) or no adjuvant treatment (n=165). We reasoned that PD-L1 expression could explain the difference in response to immunotherapy treatment by age; however, no significant difference was observed in PD-L1 expression by age among 66 cases tested at the time of submission.  Conclusions', '  Data suggest that decreased immune response and a consequent lack of response to immunotherapy might be contributing, at least in part, to the worse prognosis of older melanoma patients.

HLA-DR is a marker of M activation not expressed by suppressor myeloid cells. A novel pathology technique using mIHC allows for quantitative and spatial analysis of immune cell subsets. Methods', ' In a pilot set of stage II/III primary melanomas from Columbia University Medical Center (n = 94), clinical follow up is available for 51 cases. 32 had no evidence of recurrence at last follow up (minimum 2 years) while 19 died of melanoma. 5m slides were stained using Opal multiplexed IHC (mIHC) for DAPI, CD3, CD8, CD68, SOX10, HLA-DR and Ki67.

Results', ' In all patients (n = 94), CTLs are farther from tumor (SOX10+) cells when they are proliferating (Ki67+) (p < 0.0001***), while they are closer to M when they are activated (HLA-DR+) (p = 0.0002***). Next, we evaluated impact on prognosis using disease specific survival (DSS) as an outcome based on median value (n = 51). In this exploratory study no correction for multiple comparisons was made. We find that CTL density correlates with prolonged DSS in tumor (p = 0.0185*) but not in stroma (p = 0.1630 ns). Ratio of density of CD8/CD68+HLA-DR- correlates with DSS in both tumor (p = 0.027*) and stroma (p = 0.017*). Finally, distance from CTLs to HLA-DR- M was significantly greater in non-recurrent melanomas as compared to recurrent ones (p = 0.0167*). Conclusions', ' HLA-DR expression on M and Ki67 expression on tumor cells correlate with position of CTLs in TME in primary melanoma.

Here, we explore the biology behind liver metastasis in human melanoma and in animal models. Methods', ' Patients with metastatic melanoma with or without liver metastasis were biopsied pre- PD-1 treatment and immune infiltrates were analyzed by FACS.

The implantation of liver metastases from an unrelated MC38 tumor does not protect the subQ tumor from immune rejection. Conclusions', ' The presence of liver metastases is associated with reduced response to PD-1 blockade and reduced T-ex infiltrate in patients with stage IV melanoma.

CD8 T-cells play a critical role in the host defense against cancers and infectious diseases. However, the presence of antigen-specific CD8 T-cells does not always imply that cancers and/or pathogens are efficiently eliminated in the body. In tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS), other markers including CD103, PD-1 and FOXP3 are broadly expressed and have shown a wider range of immunoregulatory and important roles in T-cell activation, T- cell regulatory and programmed cell-death checkpoints. Existing methods can either deliver phenotypic information on homogenous samples such as flow cell cytometry or give immunohistochemical information on single biomarker. However, it would be of advantage to be able to visualize the distributions of multiple biomarkers in TILs that would discriminate stromal cells versus solid tumor. Therefore, a multiplex IHC stain utilizing a melanoma marker as a staining mask that separates the malignant tumor cells from stromal cells maybe a good strategy to facilitate better interpretation.Materials and MethodsMonoclonal mouse antibodies to CD8, FOXP3 and PD-1 and rabbit monoclonal antibodies CD8, CD103 and PD-1 were optimally tittered for single, double and triple stains and visualized with HRP DAB/Black chromogens and/or alkaline phosphatase fast red/blue chromogens. A mouse monoclonal pan melanoma cocktail was visualized with a fast red chromogen and was used as a staining mask for melanoma tumors cells, but not stromal cells.ResultsSingle, double and triple stains that included pan melanoma cocktail (mask) and CD8, CD103 FOXP3 and PD-1 were successfully established. All double and triple stains gave comparable results to single stains. The co-expression of TILs including CD8 and CD103 or CD8 or FOXP3 and PD-1 was easily identified with contrasting chromogens. TILs in stroma tissues and in malignant tumors cells were easily discriminated with the pan melanoma (mask) that stained only tumor cells with fast red chromogen, but did not stain TILS or stromal tissues.ConclusionThe evaluation of TILS in malignant melanoma was enhanced with multiplex stains. TILs in stromal tissues and melanoma tumors cells were easily distinguished with the Pan Melanoma staining mask.

Patient-derived melanoma cells were transduced with barcoded pooled lentiviral shRNA libraries that targeted the human kinome, followed by exposure to cytotoxicity mediated by autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Tumor cells were then subject to genomic deep sequencing and integrated analysis to identify depleted barcodes and corresponding genes. One identified candidate of particular interest is Aurora Kinase A (AURKA), a cell cycle regulator that has previously been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis and correlate with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Importantly, our independent screening with a bioactive compound library also implicated Aurora Kinase as an immune resistance candidate against T cell immunotherapy. Further studies showed that suppression of Aurora kinase activity with a pan inhibitor - AMG900, exhibited a synergistic cytotoxic effect with tumor infiltrating lymphocyte-mediated killing on autologous tumor cells from patients. Furthermore, our Nanostring analysis of tumor biopsies from patients that received adoptive T cell therapy revealed significantly increased expression of AURKA in tumors from non-responding patient when compared with responder counterparts.

This may, in part, explain the immunogenicity of this disease and the high rate of responsiveness to immunotherapeutic strategies such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy. Indeed, recent data have shown that cytotoxic T-cell reactivity targeting neo antigens may be common in human melanoma TILs. Importantly though, the clinical relevance of neo-antigen specific T cell populations remains uncertain.To directly address the tumoricidal potential of defined neo-antigen specific T cell populations, we first identified two neo-antigen specific T-cell populations within a bulk melanoma TIL culture by the combination of exome sequencing and MHC multimer-based T cell screens. Subsequently, we generated TIL products that are highly enriched for these neo-antigen reactivities and we compared the anti-tumor activity of these neo-antigen enriched TIL with that of standard bulk TIL in NSG mice bearing the autologous tumor. We observed outgrowth of the tumors in mice treated with standard TIL. In contrast, tumors in mice treated with enriched TILs were controlled long-term. Additional experiments showed that this superior activity of neo-antigen enriched TIL was caused by the increased numbers of T cells with a high anti-tumor activity, rather than the depletion of cell populations with inhibitory activity. Furthermore, once tumors eventually recurred these were still recognized in vitro by cells from the initially infused TIL culture.Together, these preclinical data demonstrate that neo-antigen reactive T cells within bulk TIL cultures form a critical component of anti-tumor reactivity and provide a further basis to target mutated antigens with cancer immunotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['Adoptive T-cell therapy is an effective treatment for metastatic melanoma, achieving objective clinical responses in half of patients undergoing tumor infiltration lymphocyte (TIL) therapy. Epigenetic modifications are key players in regulating gene expression. Modulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has received attention for its implications in altering gene regulation. While HDAC pan-inhibition directly affects tumor growth, the immune system may be negatively impacted. Novel HDAC-selective inhibitors can ameliorate these undesirable effects. HDAC6 is unique in containing two catalytic domains, allowing for the development of isotype-selective inhibitors. Here a novel role of HDAC6 in T-cell immunity with important implications for adoptive cell therapy was explored. Initially a delay in B16 melanoma growth was observed in HDAC6KO mice (p<0.001 at day 19). Furthermore, tumor-free HDAC6KO mice vaccinated with melanoma antigen peptides displayed a mean of 30% antigen-specific circulating CD8+ T-cells versus 12% in WT mice. Moreover, HDAC6 expression was reduced over three fold in T-cells activated in vitro. To further investigate the role(s) of HDAC6 in anti-tumor T-cell responses, the HDAC6 selective inhibitor rocilinostat was utilized. Adoptive transfer of rocilinostat-treated T-cells conferred an increased anti-melanoma response in a B16 model (day 25 mean tumor volume 800 vs. 2200 cubic mm), characterized by accumulation of central memory T-cells in the lymph nodes. To directly address the clinical potential of targeting HDAC6, T-cells from healthy human donors and melanoma patient-derived TILs were treated with rocilinostat. A modest but consistent 5% increase in central memory phenotype in healthy CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was observed. While a decrease in the nave, effector and effector memory subsets occurred, no differences in cell viability were seen. Rocilinostat treatment of TILs derived from different cell preparations (e.g. tumor digest, pre- and post-rapid expansion in vitro) displayed up to a three-fold increase in central memory in three patients analyzed. Impressively, repeated in vitro treatment with rocilinostat further increased the proportion of central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Intriguingly, initial results show that the transcription factor T-BET, involved in T-cell function, was upregulated in TILs after rocilinostat treatment and in vitro expansion. Functionally, activation of rocilinosat-treated TILs resulted in increased IFNg+CD107a+ T-cells. Ultimately, rocilinostat pre-treatment of TILs or concomitantly with tumor resulted in 70% killing of HLA matched melanoma cells, compared to 50% killing by control-treated TILs, both relative to melanoma only control. These preliminary data provide a rationale for targeting HDAC6 in T-cells to improve cancer immunotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['High dose radiation therapy generates systemic adaptive immunity that limits distal tumor progression and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade. Preclinical data demonstrate that ionizing radiation may sensitize otherwise refractory tumors to immunotherapy through mechanisms of lymphocyte activation and intratumoral recruitment, however, the molecular mechanisms that govern this response remain poorly understood. Selectins are critical regulators of leukocyte trafficking and migration, and facilitate the compartmentalization of naïve, effector and memory T cells to their respective organ sites. Importantly, inflamed vascular endothelium expresses P- and E-selectin, which facilitate peripheral tissue infiltration of effector and memory lymphocytes. Therefore, both the acquisition of functional selectin ligands expressed by T cells, as well as endothelial activation coordinates peripheral tissue infiltration following infection or tissue injury. In this work we test the hypothesis that the immunogenic potential of high dose radiation therapy is sufficient to stimulate synthesis of selectin ligands on T cells, which is required for their subsequent infiltration into distal tumors and the abscopal response. We have established a mouse model of the abscopal effect, where radiotherapy-induced immune mediated-tumor regression is observed at sites distal to the primary, irradiated tumor. B16 F10 murine melanomas expressing model and endogenous antigens are implanted intradermal on opposing flanks. One day prior to radiation, naïve TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells are transferred into tumor bearing mice and 20Gy is delivered to a single tumor by half beam block. Using this model, we demonstrate that local high dose radiation therapy is sufficient to activate and expand naïve tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor draining lymph node. Following a single high dose of radiation, tumor-specific CD8+ T cells become activated and subsequently traffic to and accumulate in distal, contralateral tumors where they limit tumor growth, thus recapitulating the clinical observation of the immune-mediated abscopal effect. Importantly, we demonstrate that high dose radiation is sufficient to upregulate selectin family of oligosaccharide binding adhesion molecules on newly activated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. The acquisition of P- and E-selectin binding capacity by effector CD8+ T cells is required for the abscopal response as administration of selectin blocking antibodies reduced intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration and failed to mediate regression of distal tumors post radiation. Our data demonstrate that the acquisition of P- and E-selectin ligands requires prior antigenic stimulation and as such, these T cells represent a completely novel population of tumor-specific, homing competent CD8+ T cells that may predict response to therapy in patients.']",

Ulcerated melanomas with low tumor stage (I/II) had higher percentage of tumor cells with nuclear livin expression than those from higher tumor stage (III/IV) (p = 0.002). Interestingly, we observed that patients with higher intensity of cytosolic expression of livin protein in the ulcerated area of tumor were more likely to have a brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) response (p = 0.001). Patients with higher intensity of cytoplasmic livin protein of tumor cells in ulcerated areas had higher risk of death compared to those with lower levels (p = 0.005). On the other hand, patients with higher intensity of cytoplasmic expression of livin in melanoma cells located superficially in the non-ulcerated areas of tumor had better prognosis (p = 0.045). Conclusion', ' Our data indicate that there is a decrease of nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression of livin protein in melanoma cells from ulcerated when compared to non-ulcerated areas. Also, cytoplasmic livin expression is an indicator of poor prognosis, but apparently only in patients with ulcerated lesions. Although IAPs regulate caspases, they also regulate signaling pathways that activate NF-B modulating immunity. The prominent TILs response in livin-positive tumors suggests a possible involvement in tumor immunity in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['There have been significant advances in the past few years with regard to BRAF-targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma, however the majority of patients have disease progression within 6 to 7 months. We have previously shown that BRAF inhibition in melanoma in vitro is associated with an increase in melanoma antigens and increased reactivity to antigen specific T cells. More recently, we corroborated these findings in vivo in patients with melanoma undergoing treatment with BRAF inhibitors, demonstrating an increase in melanoma antigens and a significant increase in CD8+ T cells following treatment. However, the nature of this immune response to BRAF inhibition is poorly understood. The goal of the present studies is to better define the T cell infiltrate, so that we can develop a therapeutic strategy to leverage their presence.To do this, we performed tumor biopsies in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing treatment with BRAF inhibitors at two time-points', ' pre-treatment (day 0), and on-treatment (day 10-14). Biopsies were also taken at time of progression when applicable. DNA was isolated and the CDR3 regions of rearranged TCR beta chain genes within the tumor were sequenced and analyzed using the immunoSEQ platform by Adaptive Biotechnologies. Results demonstrated a significant increase in the clonality in the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of the 8 patients in on-treatment vs. pre-treatment samples, suggesting that treatment with a BRAF inhibitor may induce an antigen-specific T cell response. We also sought to determine if the increase in T cells associated with BRAF inhibition is related to an infiltration of new T cell clones or a proliferation of existing clones within the tumor. To study this, we analyzed the total T cell clones in these patient samples with regard to their presence or absence in the pre-treatment compared to on-treatment samples. Results demonstrate that over 80% of the individual clones detected after initiation of BRAF-targeted therapy are new clones, suggesting that this therapy is associated with an influx of TIL into the tumors. However, if attention is focused only on the most prevalent clones rather than the total clones, there is a dichotomous relationship between change in clonal populations and magnitude of tumor regression. Namely, those who have persistence of the same dominant clones had a good treatment response, whereas those who had a change in the dominant clonal populations had a poor response. Taken together, this data suggest that though BRAF inhibition in melanoma results in infiltration of new TIL, response to treatment is dependent on a pre-existing population of TIL clones. This data has important clinical implications, and may ultimately help predict who is likely to derive the greatest benefit from BRAF-targeted therapy. A better understanding of this response may also guide us in developing rational combination therapy in the treatment of melanoma.']",

Oral TPI-1a4 increased (up to 8x) in TILs in K1735 melanoma tumors in syngeneic mice in a dose-dependent manner and in correlation with tumor growth inhibition. The growth of 4-day established K1735 tumors (s.c.) in syngeneic C3H/HeJ mice was inhibited 44% (p < 0.05) by TPI-1a4 at 0.4 mg/kg (5 d/wk, gavage) or 90% (p < 0.01) at 0.8 mg/kg (5 d/wk, gavage) during a treatment period of 4 wks.

Their combination delayed tumor growth for 4-14 wks (4/5 mice) or completely blocked tumor growth (1/5 mice) by 20th wk in association with resistance to re-challenging with the melanoma tumor (s.c.). The combination was more effective in C3H/HeJ mice with 1-day established K1735 tumors, blocked tumor growth in most mice (4/5) comparing to mostly delayed tumor growth for several wks by the individual agents.

Although response rate is over 50%, resistance eventually develops. A possible explanation is established tumors escape supported by the immune suppressive tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) including M2 type macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC).Our murine melanoma SM1 model that harbors BRAFV600 mutation is an aggressive model, where mice with established tumors have to be sacrificed within two-three weeks. Treatment with PLX4032 has significant anti-tumor effect, but it cannot fully eradicate the tumor. In addition, our prior results show that SM1 is infiltrated by M2-polarized macrophages. By depleting TIMs with the CSF-1R inhibitor, PLX3397, the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is increased. To determine if combined therapy with PLX3397 and PLX4032 improved anti-tumor responses against SM1 tumors, C57BL/6 mice with established subcutaneous SM1 tumors received oral gavage daily with PLX3397 (50mg/kg) and i.p. daily with PLX4032 (100mg/kg).

In malignant melanoma, the success of lymphocyte-targeted immunotherapies suggest that lymphocyte immunity may play a role disease outcomes. Separate evidence suggests that immunosenescence in old age is associated with impaired lymphocyte immunity. We hypothesized that fractional lymphocyte counts are associated with survival in melanoma, and that this relationship is likely to be stronger in younger as compared to older individuals.  Methods', '    We retrospectively examined the relationship between peripheral blood immune indices and survival in malignant melanoma. We identified individuals who had died from malignant melanoma in our unit over the past 2 years. We recorded pre-treatment neutrophil, lymphocyte, and total white cell counts. Survival time from diagnosis of metastatic melanomawas calculated. The principal endpoint was the assessment of correlation between lymphocyte-neutrophil ratio or fractional lymphocyte count and survival in individuals younger or older than 65 years of age.

Past studies have shown the percentage of melanoma expressing the ligand for PD1, PD-L1 varies from 38 to 53% depending on the cutoff used to determine positivity and the antibodies used. In the majority of melanoma, expression of PD-L1 was associated with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and was believed to be induced by IFN gamma from T cells. Relatively few melanomas had (constitutive) PD-L1 expression in the absence of TILs.Study and Results', ' In the present study we examined the signal pathways involved in inducible and constitutive expression of PD-L1 expression on cultured melanoma cells, including those derived from patients pre and post vemurafenib treatment. Our results suggest that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) has a role in IFN-gamma inducible expression as shown by inhibition of PD-L1 expression with the inhibitor, BMS 345541 which blocks phosphorylation of the inhibitory IkB kinase, resulting in cytoplasmic retention of NF-kB p65 and p50 subunits. Luciferase based promoter reporter assays confirmed an association between NF-kB activity and PD-L1 expression levels. Targeting NF-kB was more effective in reducing inducible PD-L1 levels than targeting either the MAPK pathway or the P13Kinase/AKT pathway. Transfections with the super repressor, Inhibitor of kappa B alpha, mutated at S32 and S36, to correlate with PD-L1 levels are being carried out. In addition, si RNA mediated knockdown of the p50 and p65 subunits to confirm the involvement of NF-kB in PD-L1 expression will be studied. We are also currently dissecting the signaling pathways involved in constitutive expression of PD-L1.NF-kB is an important protein complex involved in adaptive and innate immune response and regulates cytokine and chemokine production in melanoma. It also contributes to induction of proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival, playing a role in resistance to targeted therapy.

Methods', ' CD4+ T cells were stimulated with overlapping MMP-2 peptides. After 12 days, MMP-2-specific responses were determined by intracellular staining of cytokines. Specific T cells from positive samples were enriched and cloned using limiting dilution. Cytokine production was assessed by ELISA, intracellular staining, or cytometric bead array method. Results', ' We identified 11 novel CD4 MMP-2-derived epitopes, and showed that the corresponding T cells, detected in the CD45RO+/CD62L- memory fraction, displayed an inflammatory TH2 profile, i.e. mainly secreting TNF, IL-4 and IL-13 and expressing the TH2-specific transcription factor GATA-3. In contrast, CD4+ T cells that recognize other associated MAAs were typically TH1. Interestingly, nave T cells primed with active MMP-2 gave rise to TH2 specific cells, while nave T cells primed with peptides generated IFNg-secreting specific cells, consistent with a TH1 profile. Accordingly, we showed that the MMP-2 enzyme inhibited IL-12p35 production and induced OX40L expression by DCs. Both events were responsible for the TH2 skewing of MMP-2-specific T cells and other MAA-specific T cells. Furthermore, MMP-2 specific TH2 cells were found in 13 tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte populations out of the 31 melanoma patients tested. Conclusions', ' The protease activity of MMP-2 influences DC phenotype, more precisely IL-12 production and OX40L expression, which are responsible for the observed TH2 lineage commitment of MMP-2-specific T cells and other MAA-specific T cells.

In contrast, CD68+ macrophages were found to be abundant at all disease stages, typically comprising 5% to 20% of all cells within the tumor parenchyma. Although no significant associations were found with any immune markers in melanoma tumors, Cox regression analysis demonstrated a significant adverse association between the percentage of CD68+ macrophages in uninvolved regional LNs and overall survival (HR=1.93 per 5% increase in CD68+ cells, 95% CI (1.17, 3.18), p=0.01). Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that stage III patients harboring >15% CD68+ cells in uninvolved regional LNs had a median survival of 2.6 yr vs. 7.7 yr for patients with <15% CD68+ cells. Conclusions', ' These results suggest that melanoma involvement of regional LNs can adversely impact the immune microenvironment of adjacent uninvolved regional LNs, possibly by facilitating regional immune suppression mediated by CD68+ cells. Pharmacological targeting of tumor-associated CD68+ macrophages may favorably impact survival outcomes for patients with stage III melanoma.']",

Patients whose tumors have a high mutational burden have a better response to anti-CTLA-4 treatment with ipilimumab in melanoma5, and to anti-PD-1 treatment with pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung6 and colorectal cancer7. These results suggest that a sufficiently high non-synonymous somatic mutation burden in the tumor may lead to protein alterations that serve as neo-antigens to stimulate CD8 T-cell immune response. This immune response may be blocked by the tumor by engaging the immune checkpoint pathway, making such tumors especially vulnerable to immune checkpoint disruption. However, the specific criteria to identify patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint therapy have remained elusive so far.Using somatic mutation and RNA-Seq data from TCGA, we propose that there exists a mutational threshold, which we call the Activated Immune Mutational (AIM) Threshold, which can identify patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint therapy. Compared to AIM- patients (potential non-responders), AIM+ patients (potential responders) have tumors that meet four criteria', ' (1) a high non-synonymous mutation burden; (2) a high level of immune infiltration in the tumor; (3) a high CD8 T cell fraction in the leukocyte component of the immune infiltrate plus high expression of the T cell marker CD8A; and (4) a high expression of immune checkpoint genes PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4.We find that in melanoma, endometrial, colon, cervical and breast cancer, a clear AIM threshold satisfying all four criteria exists. The distribution of mutations in AIM- versus AIM+ tumors for these cancers is very different. In the former, there are high frequency somatic mutations in only a few genes, while in the latter, high frequency somatic mutations are found in many genes distributed over the whole genome.Pathological analysis of high-resolution images from 150 TCGA tumors (30 from each of the five tumor types) validated the presence of significantly higher lymphocytic infiltration in the AIM+ tumors compared to AIM- tumors.

This is demonstrated by the effective and additive response checkpoint blockade therapies have had during combination clinical trials in melanoma [1]. While the results of these trials have been promising, large portions of patients do not respond to treatment [1,2]. Additionally, many responders take months to show a response using standard criteria. In order to monitor patient response and understand the limitations of immunotherapy, we performed phage display to discover peptides targeted to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in melanoma tumors.To improve phage library characterization, we developed a method to deep sequence phage with the Ilumina MiSeq platform. Phage screens using PhD7 library (NEB) performed on HUVECS and on TILs, nave and effector T cells, and B cells harvested from mice. The phage libraries generated from these screens were deep sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq system. The sequencing data was analyzed with an efficient, custom MATLAB script, which arranges sequences by frequency determining peptide frequencies for each library. Peptide frequency was normalized to a reference library generated by amplifying an unscreened phage library. T cell screens were compared with B cell and endothelial cell screens in sequence frequency matrices. Top TIL targeting sequences were cloned into phage, and then fluorescently labeled along with insert-less control phage. Labeled phage were incubated with TILs, or effector T cells and analyzed for specificity using flow cytometry. Four phage clones were identified with at least four fold increased binding for TILs over effector T cells isolated from the spleen. Interestingly, only subsets of the TILs were bound by the targeted phage.We have identified and validated peptides that demonstrate specificity for CD8 TILs. These peptide sequences represent candidates for development into companion diagnostic imaging agents for use with checkpoint therapies. We are currently evaluating these peptides in an in vivo tumor model to further validate their specificity and to determine their biodistributions. Peptides that validate in vivo could be developed into useful imaging agents. After peptide sequences have been validated in vivo, we will determine the phage binding partner using a phage based pulldown. The peptide binding partners discovered through this approach will provide insight into the subset of TILs bound by the phage.[1] Wolchok, J.

The combination of radiotherapy with immunostimulatory anti-PD1 and anti-CD137 mAbs was conducive to favourable effects on distant non-irradiated tumor lesions as observed on transplanted MC38 (colorectal cancer), B16OVA (melanoma) and 4T1 (breast cancer) models. Immunotherapy and radiotherapy synergized both when irradiation was given using external beams or provided with brachytherapy. The therapeutic activity was crucially performed by CD8 T cells, as found in selective depletion experiments. The irradiation regimen induced immune infiltrate changes in the irradiated and non-irradiated lesions featured by reductions in the content of effector T cells, Tregs, and myeloid-derived supresor cells (MDSC), while effector T cells were expressing more intracellular IFN gamma in both the irradiated and contralateral tumors. Importantly, 48h following irradiation CD8+ TILs showed brighter expression of CD137 and PD-1 thereby displaying more target molecules for the activity of the corresponding monoclonal antibodies. Likewise, PD-1 and CD137 were induced on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from surgically excised of human carcinoma lessions that were irradiated ex-vivo.

Nanostring analysis of tumor fragments showed decreased expression in NR in several epigenetic regulatory genes including DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A) and histone deacetylases (HDAC8, SIRT4)(p < 0.05). MiR-148 and miR-185, known regulators of DMNT1, were increased in accordance with the patterns seen for DNMT1, a known regulator of CD4/CD8 lineage commitment. Higher levels of CD4/CD8 double positive TILs were found in NR infusion products. Conclusions', ' These results demonstrate that resistance to TIL therapy is characterized by altered DNA methylation and histone acetylation patterns accompanied by differences in genes regulating these marks. It is hypothesized that epigenetic dysregulation of CD4/CD8 lineage impairs the therapeutic efficacy of TIL therapy.

        "Background":"['The pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of Helicobacter pylori neutrophil activating protein (Hp-NAP) not only make it play an important role in disease pathogenesis, but also make it a potential candidate for applications, including vaccine and drug development. Our previous work demonstrated that the recombinant Hp-NAP fused with the maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli (rMBP-NAP) exert an important role in regulating the differentiation of Th1 cells. As a potential TLR2 ligand, it was reported to possess the ability to induce systemic antitumor immunity in murine hepatoma H22 and sarcoma S180 tumor models. To further understand the antitumor and immunomodulatory effect of rMBP-NAP, we elucidate the effect and mechanism of rMBP-NAP at the local immune response modulation in established mouse B16-F10 melanoma pulmonary metastasis model. Our results demonstrated that metastatic lung tumor growth was significantly arrested after rMBP-NAP treatment, along with marked reduction in the number of lung nodules and significant increase in survival. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping and Quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that rMBP-NAP could induce both local and systemic immune responses, which associated with higher influx of CD3+CD4+T cells, CD3+CD8+T cells and higher secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-27 cytokines. The intraperitoneal administration of rMBP-NAP in mice promoted infiltration of lymphocyte in the lungs and reduced the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF) -β, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect in local area. By comparing with control mice, mRNA expression of chemokines also revealed that rMBP-NAP treatment substantially decreased the expression of CCL2 and CCL20 in tumor tissues, which are central to recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) to tumor microenviroment and form immunosuppression. Moreover, we assess the expression of vascular marker CD34 in pulmonary section using immunohistochemical method, the results showed the vascularization was apparently inhibited in rMBP-NAP treated tumor bearing mouse. In conclusion, rMBP-NAP could induce the activation of effective Th1/Tc1 cells and the production of relevant inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are responsible for enhencing T cell immunity and reversing immunosuppression against metastatic cancer progression. Our findings strongly indicate that rMBP-NAP treatment might be a novel therapeutic approach against metastatic melanoma, and rMBP-NAP might be a potential template for the development of agents that could be used as immunomodulatory adjuvant in the therapy against melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['The PD-1/PD-L1 (programmed cell death protein 1; programmed death-ligand 1) pathway plays a key role in immunological tolerance and autoimmunity. PD-1 is primarily expressed on activated T and B cells while its receptor, PD-L1, is expressed in a variety of cell types including resting lymphocytes, DCs, and macrophages. Recently, multiple human solid tumor types (melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, ovarian, and colorectal cancer) have been found to overexpress PD-L1 within its tumor microenvironment. More importantly, PD-1/PD-L1 blocking agents (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, lambrolizumab, MPDL3280A) have been found active as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy and some have produced durable clinical responses. On the other hand, human epithelial tumors are also known to overexpress the high-affinity folate receptor (FR)-alpha that is capable of bringing folate-linked drugs into the cell cytosol via endocytosis. Using flow cytometry, we assessed PD-L1 expression in various FR-positive syngeneic mouse tumor models (M109, Renca, L1210A, 4T1-Cl2, ID8-Cl15). PD-L1 expression was found to vary significantly among different tumor types and could be found not only on CD45- malignant cells but also on tumor stromal cells such as F4/80+CD11b+ tumor-associated macrophages. Using a rat anti-mouse PD-1 antibody (clone RMP1-14), we studied in-vivo efficacy of a folate-targeted chemotherapy in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockage in PD-L1-expressing tumor models. In syngeneic models with high PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a synergistic and curable anti-tumor effect was observed and the animals developed tumor-protective immunity against rechallenge.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer remains a major cause of cancer mortality. Malignant lesions are normally endogenously corrected by the immune surveillance system. However, tumors evade this immunity by inducing immunosuppressive microenvironments during cancer progression. It has been thought that there are two critical components of tumors making them capable of maintaining the immunosuppressive microenvironment. One is the inhibition of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity against the tumor through immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1 (PD-1), which are negative regulators of CTL, and the other is by the induction of tumor infiltrating immune suppressive cells, which can deactivate the CTL. Recent studies demonstrate that multiple cancer types, including melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder, and stomach, respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1 and PD-1 with 11-30% response rates and durable responses. However, a substantial number of patients still fail to respond to immunotherapy and the refractory mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we focus on KRas-driven lung cancers, as there are no clinically effective targeted drugs available for treating this type of lung cancer. We demonstrate that during the progression of tumors in KRas mutation and p53 knockout-driven lung cancer mouse models; KRasG12D/+;p53-/- (KP), there is a gradual increase in the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and that the combination of either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody along with a MEK inhibitor, which targets downstream of KRas signaling, shows anticancer efficacy in these animal models. These combinations, in comparison to either single agent alone, effectively blocks the growth of subcutaneously (s.c.) injected syngeneic mouse lung cancer cells in immune competent transgenic KP mice, significantly increasing the survival rates', ' 37.5% (for anti-PD-1 antibody and MEK inhibitor), 62.5% (for anti-PD-L1 antibody and MEK inhibitor) vs. 0% single agents or control at the end of treatment. We find that the tumors in the control treated group harbor a substantial number of immune cells, including PD-L1 expressing MDSC. The combination treatment with either an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody along with a MEK inhibitor dramatically modulates the composition and the activity of tumor infiltrated immune cells. Tumors in the combined treated group show a significant decrease in PD-L1 expressing MDSC in comparison with control tumors. Additionally, a combined treatment would block the PD-L1 activity of the infiltrated PD-L1 expressing MDSC in malignant tumors and thus lead to improved survival.

Methods', '    We identified pts who have undergone craniotomy for MBMs. Evaluation entailed complete clinical information, acquisition of archived melanoma brain metastases, histopathologic analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections (n=101), whole genome expression profiling (WGEP, Illumina DASL) in 29 archived tissues. Results were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH).  Results', '    In univariate analysis (log-rank) factors significantly associated with prolonged survival were high immune infiltrate (HII) plus low hemorrhage (hazard ratio, HR, 2.71, p<0.001), present melanin (1.67, p=0.03), and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class 1 (0.37, p<0.0001). No association between HII and use of immunotherapy prior to craniotomy was noted. Only RPA class 1 (p=0.029) and HII plus low hemorrhage (p=0.002) remained significant in Cox proportional hazards model analysis. Gene set analysis of WGEP data confirmed that Encarta pathways related with T-cell activation and differentiation were significantly associated with prolonged survival whereas Y branching of actin filaments, presenilin action in Notch and Wnt signaling, G-protein signaling through tubby protein, lissencephaly gene in neuronal migration and development are among the gene categories associated with worse survival. IHC and ISH analysis of tumor sections for various markers (n=40) showed that high peritumoral CD3+ (3.31, p=0.009), high peritumoral CD4+ (4.41, p=0.014), and high peritumoral CD8+ (3.02, p=0.030) are associated with prolonged survival whereas neither CD14+ nor FoxP3+ infiltrate, nor high melanoma expression of antigen presentation molecules are associated with survival.  Conclusions', '    Our study is the first to document that high peritumoral T-cell infiltrates are associated with prolonged survival. High tumor hemorrhage, an adverse prognostic sign, reflects aggressive melanoma cells that migrate and invade in the brain.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Herpes Virus Entry Mediator (HVEM) is a member of the TNF superfamily, its ligation of the immunoglobulin family member B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) activates inhibitory signaling in T-cells and could play a role in evading host anti-tumor immunity. Ectopic overexpression of HVEM is associated with poor survival in some solid tumors. Our objectives were', ' -to evaluate HVEM expression in melanoma (MM) -to explore potential link of its overexpression with clinical outcomes -to understand the mechanisms by which HVEM was ectopically expressed in MM, and how HVEM-BTLA may play a role in MM. Methods', ' HVEM expression was analyzed by IHC in formalin-fixed samples of mm metastases and was correlated with OS in 130 patients. To better understand how HVEM could interfere with prognosis, relation of HVEM with its ligand BTLA was studied in the tumor and tumor microenvironment on 15 fresh metastases by flow cytometry after tumor dissociation. Bioinformatic studies based on TCGA and CCLE data combined to targeting of candidate genes by siRNA were used to investigate HVEM regulation on MM. Results', ' Patients with high HVEM expression on mm cells in their metastases have a significantly (p = 0.0142) poorer overall survival than those with a low expression. TCGA transcriptomic data support these results. From the mechanistic point of view, we could show that 1-HVEM expressed at the tumor cell surface interacts with BTLA expressed by tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes. 2-HVEM expression is neither linked to the mm mutational status nor inducible by IFN 3-Genes co-regulated with HVEM are associated with an aggressive gene signature 4- HVEM strongly correlate with MITF expression, MITF binds HVEM promoter, and its downregulation by siRNA results in a decrease in HVEM expression. Conclusions', ' A high expression of HVEM by mm metastases seems to be a pejorative prognostic marker. HVEM-BTLA interaction is a co-signaling system similar to the PD1-PDL1 one, but seem to be constitutive rather than inducible. HVEM and its co-regulated genes may constitute a signature of aggressiveness associated to MITF. High HVEM expression on mm cells may dampen anti-tumor immune responses, making HVEM and BTLA potential new targets for checkpoint blockade therapy.']",

        "Background":"['We previously observed that chronic consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) increased the melanoma progression and lymph node metastasis in C57BL/6N mice injected with B16F10 melanoma cells. -caryophyllene (BCP) is a natural bicyclic sesquiterpene found in many essential oils especially clove and oregano oils. In the present study, we examined whether BCP inhibits HFD-induced melanoma growth and metastasis in the B16F10 allograft model. Four-week old, male C57BL/6 mice were fed on a HFD (60 kcal% fat) or control diet (CD, 10 kcal% fat) with or without BCP (0.15, 0.3% in diet) for a period of 21 weeks. Following 16 weeks of either CD or HFD in the absence or presence of BCP, B16F10 melanoma cells were subcutaneously injected into mice and all mice were continuously fed identical diets. Three weeks post-injection, tumors were resected and mice were sacrificed three weeks post-resection. The body weights and the growth of solid tumors were markedly increased in the HFD group as compared to the CD group, and these increases were suppressed by BCP treatment. The expression of proteins related to cell proliferation (Ki67, CDK4, cyclin A, and cyclin D1), angiogenesis (VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, and CD31) and lymphangiogenesis (VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGFR-3, and LYVE-1) was markedly increased in tumor tissues of the HFD group as compared to the CD group, and these increases were blocked by BCP treatment. HFD feeding increased the infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes and F4/80+ macrophages into tumor tissues. The administration of BCP significantly suppressed HFD-induced the infiltration of the immune cells into tumor tissues. HFD feeding reduced TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in the tumor tissues, which was prevented by BCP treatment. Two weeks after tumor resection, the mice evidenced lung and lymph node metastasis. Lung and lymph node metastasis were increased in the mice fed on HFD, and these increases were markedly suppressed by BCP treatment. The present results demonstrate that BCP suppressed HFD-stimulated melanoma progression and metastasis, which may have been mediated via the suppression of cell cycle progression, angiogenesis and lymph angiogenesis, and induction of apoptosis in tumor tissues. These results suggest that BCP has potential as an anti-cancer agent for the prevention of obesity-stimulated melanoma progression.']",
