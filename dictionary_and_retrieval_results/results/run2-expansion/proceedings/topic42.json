        "Background":"['Small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO1) is a conserved member of the ubiquitin-related protein family. Recently we have shown that the cell cycle G1 phase cyclin-dependent kinase-6 (CDK6) is modified by SUMO1 in glioblastoma (Bellail et al., Nat Commun. 2014). CDK6 sumoylation stabilizes CDK6 protein and its kinase activity and drives cell cycle progression for the cancer development and progression. SUMO1 is covalently attached to the Lysine 216 of the CDK6 protein through catalytic reactions by an E1 (SUMO-activating enzyme 1/2) and an E2-conjugating enzyme (UBC9). In this study, we further showed that UBC9 is phosphorylated by CDK1 kinase during mitosis and UBC9 phosphorylation increases the interaction of UBC9 with CDK6 and enhances SUMO1-CDK6 conjugation. Knockdown of SUMO1 by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) abolishes the interaction of UBC9 and CDK6 and SUMO1-CDK6 conjugation. UBC9 is conjugated by SUMO1 and recognizes its substrate protein through interaction of SUMO1 and SUMO-Interacting motif (SIMs) on the substrate protein. Indeed, the survey of CDK6 amino acid sequence and structure identified four SIMs on CDK6 protein. Each SIM was mutated to abrogate its binding property. Of the 4 SIMs, the CDK6-SIM4 is responsible for UBC9-CDK6 interaction as demonstrated by the finding that mutation of the first two amino-acids of the SIM sequence abolishes UBC9-CDK6 interaction and SUMO1-CDK6 conjugation. Our data show that UBC9 sumoylation is required for its interaction with CDK6 protein through SIM and thus involved in glioblastoma progression.']",

        "Background":"['Almost 80% of glioblastoma tumors have alterations in the CNKN2A-CDK-Rb pathway. Cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) act as cell cycle regulators and have been recognized as therapeutic targets for glioblastoma (GBM). In the current study, we determined the antitumor activity of CDK4/6 inhibition (palbociclib and abemaciclib) alone and in combination with radiation on a panel of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The GSCs were molecularly characterized using multiple omimcs techniques and Western blots identified specific phospho- and total protein levels. Approximately 50% of cell lines have homozygous deletion of CDKN2A although CDK4 and CDK6 protein expression was significantly elevated in most of the GSCs. RB protein was constitutively phosphorylated in only a subset (45%)', ' GSC11, GSC262, GSC231, GSC304 and GSC7-2. In our panel of GSCs, there were total of three cell lines with CDKN2A loss, RB phosphorylation and CDK4/6 overexpression (GSC262, GSC11 and GSC231). Our data showed that GSC262, GSC11, GSC231 (CDKN2A deletion, RB intact), GSC7-2 and GSC300 (CDKN2A WT, RB intact) were sensitive to CDK4/6 treatment (IC50  1M). CDK4/6 inhibitor treated GSCs showed G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased phospho-RB levels in GSC262 and GSC7-2 cells. We next determined whether CDK4/6 inhibition combined with radiation has additive or synergistic antitumor effect. A clonogenic assay demonstrated that neurosphere formation was significantly decreased by CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with radiation compared to either treatment in GSC262 (resistant to radiation treatment) or GSC7-2 (sensitive to radiation treatment) cell lines. The radiation resistant GSC (GSC262) treated with radiation and CDK4/6 inhibitor became sensitive to radiation therapy whereas radiation sensitive GSC (GSC7-2) had a significant decrease in colony formation compared to radiation alone. CDK4/6 combined with radiation increased -H2AX protein expression levels and decreased cyclin D1 protein expression in a time dependent manner compared to single drug treatment. These data indicate synergistic antitumor effects of CDK4/6 inhibition combined with radiation therapy in GSCs in vitro. Further investigation is ongoing to evaluate this combination therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Patient with glioblastoma (GBM) with unmethylated MGMT promoters derive limited benefit from temozolomide (TMZ) and have dismal outcome. Prioritizing the numerous available therapies and biomarkers for late stage testing requires an efficient clinical testing platform. INSIGhT (NCT02977780) is a biomarker-based, Bayesian adaptively randomized, multi-arm phase II platform screening trial for patients with newly diagnosed GBM and unmethylated MGMT promoters. Methods', ' INSIGhT compares experimental arms to a common control of standard concurrent TMZ and radiation therapy (RT) followed by adjuvant TMZ. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). Patients with newly diagnosed, unmethylated GBM that are IDH R132H mutation negative, and with genomic data available or who consent to whole exome sequencing through the ALLELE companion study for biomarker grouping are eligible. Two experimental arms consist of concurrent RT/TMZ followed by adjuvant neratinib (EGFR, HER2, and HER4 inhibitor) or abemaciclib CDK 4/6 inhibitor), respectively, in place of TMZ. The other experimental arm is CC-115 (TORC1/2 and DNA PK inhibitor), which replaces TMZ in both the concurrent and adjuvant phases. Biomarker groups include', ' EGFR + patients with EGFR amplification/mutation; PI3K + patients with PIK3CA mutation/amplification, PIK3R1 mutation, AKT3amplification, PIK3C2B > 1 copy gain, or PTEN dual loss; CDK', ' + patients with wild-type RB1 and CDK4 amplification, CDK6 amplification, or CDKN2A > 1 copy loss. Given the lack of pretrial biomarker data and the anticipated overlap of the groups, randomization will initially be equal. As the trial progresses, randomization probabilities will be adapted based on the Bayesian estimation of the probability of treatment impact on progression-free survival (PFS). These randomization probabilities can vary among the biomarker groups so predictive biomarkers will be identified and utilized if present. Treatment arms may drop due to low probability of treatment impact on OS, and new arms may be added. Experimental arms are compared only with control and should be thought of as discrete experimental questions, with INSIGhT being open to new investigators with proposed therapeutic hypotheses.

        "Background":"['Background', '    Multi-dimensional cancer genotyping has the potential to advance clinical diagnostics and improve results of clinical trials by identifying targetable genomic aberrations for glioblastoma (GBM). However, prospective use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical samples for multiplex copy number and somatic mutation genotyping in clinical trials is not yet routinely performed. We evaluated feasibility and implemented a combined copy number and clinical research mutation-testing program (PROFILE) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.    Methods', '   We collected molecular profiling results from clinical and clinical research testing on 250 GBM patients from the Brigham and Womens Hospital Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics. These data included array comparative genomic hybridization (OncoCopy, n=250), mass spectrometry-based mutation genotyping (OncoMap, n=86), and targeted cancer exome sequencing of 275 known cancer genes (OncoPanel, n=98).   Results', '    We successfully reported OncoCopy profiles for 42 relevant loci in 97% of samples and demonstrated that analysis of 250 GBMs reliably detected amplifications or structural variations in common drug targets for clinical trials (EGFR, EGFRvIII, MET, MDM2, MDM4, PDGFRA, CDK4, and CDK6) at expected frequencies. OncoMap results for 86 GBMs revealed recurrent mutations in IDH1, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PIK3R1 while less frequent mutations were detected in tumor suppressor genes TP53, PTEN and RB1.  OncoPanel results were reported on >90% of patients and comprehensively detected known mutations of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic relevance (e.g. IDH1 p.R132H, BRAF p.V600E). Tumor suppressor gene mutations and variants were robustly detected allowing for integrative OncoCopy and OncoPanel reporting in 65% of cases.    Conclusions', '   These complementary clinical assays allowed efficient and reliable identification of diagnostic aberrations that serve as clinically actionable drug targets, which could be incorporated into genomically stratified multi-arm clinical trial design for GBM.']",

Whole genome copy number is relevant for glioblastoma and other brain tumors but routine prospective FFPE-based multiplex copy number and somatic mutation genotyping for clinical trials has not been achieved.  Methods', '  Using novel DNA extraction protocols we implemented whole genome copy number (Agilent aCGH stock 1M feature arrays) and somatic mutation profiling (Oncomap v4.4 Sequenom) assays into a CLIA-certified laboratory setting. Twenty-three copy number aberrations (CNAs) relevant to brain tumors were reported from whole genome data and Oncomap results were reported for 471 cancer-related mutations in 41 genes.  Results', '  During the initial eight months of our combined copy number and mutation-testing program, aCGH and Oncomap were performed prospectively on 239 and 157 brain tumor patients respectively. Copy number was reported in 90% of patients (214/239) and failures were due to insufficient DNA from small biopsies.  GBMs (n = 94) harbored gains and losses at expected rates and included amplifications of common drug targets (EGFR, EGFRv3, MET, MDM2, MDM4, PDGFRA, CDK4, CDK6). Emerging candidate drug targets were identified including variant EGFR deletions (e.g. EGFRv2) and FGFR3-TACC3 gains for which other clinical tests are not available. Oncomap results for 78 GBMs revealed mutations in TP53, PTEN and IDH1. Less frequent mutations occurred in BRAF, RB1, PIK3CA, PIK3R1 and KRAS.  We integrated copy number and mutation data for 27 GBMs, allowing for improved evaluation of tumor suppressor inactivation status (e.g. PTEN mutation with monosomy 10). In combination, our assays reported data on 10 clinically actionable drug targets relevant for 15 clinical trials open at the time of patient testing.
