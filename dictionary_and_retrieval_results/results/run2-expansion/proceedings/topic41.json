Similarly, gene rearrangements in NTRK1 have been identified as a potentially actionable oncogenic aberration. TSR-011 inhibits ALK and tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) A, B, and C receptor activity with IC50 values < 3 nM and exhibits inhibition of oncogenic echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 (EML4)-ALK and tropomyosin (TPM)-TRKA dependent tumor growth in mice.  Methods', '  A Ph 1-2a dose escalation and cohort expansion study is underway to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of TSR-011.  Ph 1 is evaluating unselected patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. The recommended Ph 2 dose will be evaluated in Ph 2a in patients with ALK+ or TRK ligand/receptor + tumors (defined by immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in-situ hybridization) including those with NSCLC progressing on, or nave to, ALK inhibitor therapy.  Results', '  Twenty-three patients with advanced cancer have been enrolled at oral total daily doses between 30 and 480 mg, including NSCLC (n=10, including 5 ALK+), pancreatic (3), ovarian (2), salivary gland (2) and 1 each with papillary thyroid, cholangiocarcinoma, bladder, carcinoid, colon & leiomyosarcoma. Bi-exponential PK was observed, with dose proportional Cmax and AUC and t1/2 of 12-24 h. Dose-limiting toxicities included dysaesthesia and QTc prolongation; MTD has been defined. PK modeling revealed that a fractionated dose of 60 mg daily (dose expansion cohort) minimizes peak exposure and achieves sustained trough concentrations well above the IC50 for ALK inhibition. Of 5 patients with ALK+ NSCLC, 3 (all crizotinib-resistant) achieved PR (1 met RECIST criteria and 2 had non-measurable disease, so not formally RECIST-classified) 1 is early (not imaged yet), and 1 discontinued for DLT.  Stable disease was observed in ALK- papillary thyroid, pancreatic and colorectal patients.  Conclusions', '  TSR-011 is a well-tolerated promising second-generation agent for ALK-dependent and crizotinib resistant NSCLC, and is being explored in ALK+ and TRK+ tumors.

Deregulated kinase activity of trk family members is associated with human cancer. Oncogenic translocations involving trkC kinase domain have been identified in AML, salivary gland carcinoma, adult secretory breast cancer, congenital fibrosarcoma, and pediatric nephroma. Oncogenic trkA translocations have been reported in papillary thyroid and colorectal cancers. We have identified orally bioavailable, potent and selective ATP-competitive inhibitors of the trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases and are developing these for the treatment of Trk-driven cancers. AR523 is a pan-Trk inhibitor which demonstrates similar activity against TrkA, TrkB and TrkC receptors in a cell based assay (IC50 10 nM). In a screen at 1 M against a panel of 230 kinases, AR523 inhibited only three additional kinases more than 50% (TNK2, Bmx and Txk). In cell culture AR523 was found to exhibit selective anti-proliferative activity toward the cell line KM12, which harbors the oncogenic TPM-TrkA translocation, while exhibiting no activity toward HT29, a cell line with no trk gene rearrangements. Studies in mice engrafted with KM12 tumors revealed significant anti-tumor and pharmacodynamic activity of AR523. Administration of a single oral dose of AR523 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA by nearly 80% at twelve hours after dosing. Parallel analysis of Akt and Erk revealed reduced phosphorylation of these downstream effectors. Administration of 100 mg AR523 daily for two weeks to mice with KM12 xenografts produced mean tumor growth inhibition of 86% and a mean of 42% tumor regression. AR523 exhibits dose dependent inhibition of tumor growth at 10 and 30 mg/kg in KM12 xenografts with 54 and 72% TGI respectively. AR523 was well-tolerated, causing no weight loss or deaths compared with vehicle control.

        "Background":"[\"Gene rearrangements involving NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and ALK result in oncogenic fusion proteins that have been identified in many types of cancer, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, papillary thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma and other histologies. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available, highly potent and selective ATP-competitive pan-Trk, ROS1 and ALK inhibitor. In preclinical studies, entrectinib effectively inhibits target kinase activity and cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth across various fusion partners and cancer types. More importantly, entrectinib's activity has been validated clinically in patients across multiple fusion partners and tissue histologies.Trk inhibitors, including entrectinib, have shown promising clinical activity in molecularly selected patients. Predictably, potential resistance mechanisms have also begun to emerge. For example, mutations in the Trk kinase domain were identified as one of the in vitro induced resistance mechanisms to the Trk inhibitor, Loxo-101. The three reported resistance mutations in the Ba/F3-MPRIP-NTRK1 cell line model treated with Loxo-101 were F589, G667 and V573. The F589 location on TrkA is equivalent to the gatekeeper mutations, L1196 location on ALK and L2026 location on ROS1. These gatekeeper mutations often arise as resistance mechanisms in patients treated with ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. To test the activity of entrectinib against these three reported NTRK1 mutations, we introduced mutated Trk proteins into Ba/F3 and cancer cell lines and performed dose-dependent proliferation studies. Entrectinib was able to inhibit proliferation of cells harboring each of these three mutations that confer resistance to other Trk inhibitors. Particularly, the IC50 values of entrectinib against kinase domain wildtype and gatekeeper mutated (F589) are essentially unchanged (low single-digit nM), which is consistent with the observation that entrectinib is also able to inhibit the gatekeeper mutation in ALK (L1196) in both cell based assays and in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that entrectinib is an effective treatment for patients with NTRK-rearranged tumors, including cancers that harbor certain resistance mutations to other Trk inhibitors.\"]",

One of the inhibitors, GVK-TrkI showed potent activity with an IC50 of 0.8 nM and 1.5 nM in the cell based assays for WT TrkA (AD293 cells expressing TrkA) and TPM3-NTRK1 fusion (KM12 cells) respectively. Potent activity of 12.5 nM IC50 was observed in TrkA Z-lyte kinase assay. Significant change in TrkA Z-lyte kinase IC50 was not observed at multiple ATP concentrations ranging from 100 uM to 1 mM suggesting non-ATP competitive mode of inhibition.

Recent studies on many types of solid tumors showed that fusion genes often play driver roles and are promising targets for pharmaceutical intervention. To survey potential fusion genes in GBM, we analysed RNA-Seq data from 162 GBM patients available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). From the analysis, we identified recurrent fusion of neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1, also called TrkA) to the genes highly expressed in neuronal tissues, neurofascin (NFASC) and brevican (BCAN). NTRK1 is a mediator of the pro-survival signaling of nerve growth factor (NGF) and is a known oncogene, found commonly altered in human cancer. While GBMs largely lack NTRK1 expression, the fusion-positive GBMs express fusion transcripts in high abundance that retain NTRK1 kinase domain in frame. Analyses of the matching Exome-Seq data indicated that NFASC-NTRK1 fusion occurred through DNA-level rearrangement, whereas BCAN-NTRK1 fusion presumably occurred at RNA-level. As analogous NTRK1-fusions with thyroid-expressed genes were previously shown to drive thyroid cancer, NTRK1-fusion in GBM might have a similar role. Consistent with this hypothesis, the GBMs that harbor the NTRK1-fusion showed elevated NGF/NTRK1 pathway activity. About 1% of GBM patients are estimated to have NTRK1-fusion; these patients might benefit from potential NTRK1 inhibition therapies.Citation Format', ' Jinkuk Kim, Hee-Jin Cho, Gye-Hyun Cho, Young-Hyeh Ko, Soonmyung Paik, Do-Hyun Nam.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) develops from calcitonin-secreting, C cells, in the thyroid gland. Surgical removal of the thyroid is the best treatment currently available for early stage cancer patients but advanced forms of MTC are often incurable and fatal. Thus, better therapies are needed. A lack of relevant animal models for this disease has slowed the development of new treatments. We have recently reported a novel conditional mouse model for MTC. In these mice, overexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk 5), activator, p25 in C cells induces MTC tumors. Furthermore, interruption of p25 overexpression results in growth arrest of these tumors. Here we take advantage of our conditional mouse model to investigate the molecular pathways underlying MTC tumorigenesis. We used Illumina Mouse WG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip to compare the gene expression profile of proliferating versus arrested mouse MTC tumors. We found that a total of 920 genes encoding transcription factors, cell cycle proteins, motor proteins and angiogenesis factors were differentially regulated in growing versus arrested tumors. Particularly the genes encoding cell cycle proteins that are involved in the regulation of Rb pathway were significantly up-regulated in the proliferating tumors. Selected genes with higher degrees of change were evaluated by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting analyses. Taken together these findings suggests that the Rb signaling pathways is involved in MTC tumorigenesis and that Cdk5 may act as a critical regulator of the Rb signaling pathway in this cancer.

Rb loss is detected in  90% of SCLC and p53 is mutated in 80% of cases providing evidence that Rb and p53 suppress SCLC. Extensive genetic evidence in mouse models also supports a critical role for Rb in suppressing MTC', ' however, the mechanisms promoting tumorigenesis in Rb and p53 deficient cells and their relation to therapeutic response remain unclear. In this study, a conditional SCLC and MTC mouse model was generated by targeting Rb and p53 ablation or mutant protein expression to lung and thyroid epithelial cells. Rb loss alone resulted in slowly progressing MTC and lung neuroendocrine hyperplasia. While p53 alteration alone was not sufficient for tumor initiation, p53 loss or mutation in Rb deficient cells led to MTC and SCLC with metastases, phenotypically mimicking human disease. Mice expressing p53 R172H (R175H in human), but not R270H (R273H in human), mutant protein had a gain-of-function phenotype as evidenced by decreased survival of Rb/p53R172H as compared to Rb/p53 ablated mice. No dominant negative effect was detected by comparing Rb/p53+/mutant to Rb/p53+/ mice. Mechanistic studies revealed p53 dependent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation in MTC without coincident AKT or MAPK pathway activation. Similar mTOR pathway activation was detected in Rb/p53 deficient and mutant lungs. Rapamycin dramatically inhibited mTOR pathway signaling in Rb/p53 deficient or mutant thyroid tumors and lungs in vivo as well as in MTC and SCLC tumor cells in culture. Interestingly, mTORC1 inhibition was not associated with feedback AKT or MAPK pathway activation in vitro or in vivo as previously reported for breast and prostate cancers. Rapamycin inhibited MTC and SCLC tumor cell growth demonstrating a functional role for mTOR activation in tumor progression. These studies identify distinct, cooperative Rb and p53 tumor suppressive functions. The oncogenic stimulus provided by Rb loss induces aberrant cell growth and leads to a p53 tumor suppressive response that inhibits tumor progression and mTOR dependent cell growth demonstrating that mTOR pathway inhibition is a critical p53 tumor suppressive function. Notably, rapamycin did not result in feedback MAPK or AKT pathway activation providing evidence this is not a general mechanism limiting therapeutic response to mTORC1 inhibition. Together these studies provide mechanistic links between genetic alterations and aberrant signaling pathways critical in carcinogenesis. In addition to providing mechanistic insights, this genetically engineered mouse model provides a robust preclinical platform to explore novel therapeutic strategies and define mechanisms underlying treatment response and resistance.']",

Oncogenic mutations of the RET proto-oncogene are found in all hereditary MTC and 45% of the sporadic cases. However, it is clear that additional genetic lesions contribute to the development of both RET-dependent and RET independent MTC. We analyzed 30 primary medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) tumors by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays (Agilent 244K) and a subset of those tumors by ultra-high-resolution SNP arrays (Affymetrix SNP6.0). A consistent finding with both arrays was a loss localized to 22q13.1 in 40% of tumors. This region contains the ATF4 gene and loss of this gene was validated by real time PCR.ATF4 is a central mediator of integrated stress response pathway and activates expression of a cohort of downstream target genes known to be involved in cell survival, apoptosis, autophagy and senescence. We hypothesize that the loss of ATF4 expression contributes to MTC progression through mechanisms involving aberrant proliferation and escape from apoptosis. We present several findings to support this. First, ATF4 protein levels were found downregulated in 50% MTC tumor tissues (n = 43) and low ATF4 expression was associated with poor overall survival in MTC patients (HR = 5.015, 95% CI', ' 1.38-10.64), P = 0.013). A negative correlation was observed between RET and ATF4 protein expression in MTC tumors (r = -0.89, R square = 0.799, p<0.0001). Second, we showed that targeted heterozygote and homozygous deletion of Atf4 in mice causes C cell hyperplasia, a precancerous lesion preceding MTC. Third, ATF4 overexpression inhibits proliferation and survival of MTC derived cell lines. ATF4 decreases RET protein levels by inducing ubiquitination and degradation of activated RET. In contrast, ATF4 depletion upregulates RET protein levels as well as RET autophosphorylation. Finally, combination treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sunitinib) and eeyarestatin that stimulates ATF4 transcription, induces apoptosis of the MTC cells in a synergistic manner through activation of ATF4 and its target genes NOXA and PUMA as well. These results suggest ATF4 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in MTC. We postulate that inactivation of ATF4 is a central impediment to induction of apoptosis in MTC tumors. Therefore, strategies to upregulate ATF4 during TKI therapy would render tumor cells exquisitely sensitive to stress induced apoptosis, offering a novel synergistic treatment.']",

However, the efficacy of TKIs is limited and development of TKI resistance is common.Here we examined, the effect of a combinatorial drug therapy using the TKI, Nintedanib, and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, Romidepsin, on MTC growth in the NSE/p25-gfp bi-transgenic mouse line, an inducible MTC mouse model (see Pozo et al. 2013). The TKI- and HDAC inhibitors were administered intraperitoneally for 3 weeks and tumor growth progression was monitored using a T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging on a 7 Tesla system. Tumor tissues were analyzed for oncogenic signaling pathways by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.We find that co-administration of Nintedanib and Romidepsin stops tumor growth and increases the number of necrotic foci within the tumor tissue. Interestingly, Nintedanib treatment alone reduced tumor vascularization as shown by decreased density of the vascular marker, CD31, but did not stop parafollicular cell proliferation.

In order to explore this link, we have investigated the expression of RET in a large cohort of over 400 thyroid tumour samples of multiple histologies, ranging from benign lesions through to aggressive, metastatic disease by immunhistochemistry using a thyroid tissue microarray. Our data suggest that RET expression may correlate with more aggressive phenotype across a broader spectrum of tumours than previously predicted. We are currently investigating this association further; first by examining the expression of two major RET protein isoforms, RET9 and RET51, in this panel of tumours, and second, by investigating the coexpression of RET with another group of proteins associated with tumour progression, the integrin family. In preliminary studies, we have evaluated RET coexpression with two integrin subunits, ITGB1 and ITGB3.

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and incidences are rising. MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in playing a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of thyroid cancer, as evidenced by the high incidence of non-overlapping mutations of the genes encoding RET and TRK, as well as of NRAS, HRAS, KRAS and BRAF. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is commonly associated with mutations of the RAS family of oncoproteins, while papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is often associated with mutations in BRAF. To determine whether mode of MAPK activation played a role in thyroid cancer development in mice, we generated HrasG12V and BrafV600E knock-in models. We report that a thyroid specific knock-in of HrasG12V and Pten inactivation leads to the development of FTCs and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTCs) by 47-52 weeks of age in HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre mice. In stark contrast, mice with a thyroid specific knock-in of BrafV600E and loss of Pten (BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre) rapidly develop PDTCs and anaplastic thyroid cancer with complete lethality by weaning, suggesting that Braf and Hras, in cooperation with PI3K signaling, likely play distinct roles in the development and progression of disease. We next sought to dissect the role of Hras versus Braf activation in FTC versus PTC development. We derived stable cell lines from HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre and BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre tumors in order to identify cellular and molecular consequences of Hras versus Braf activation and their potential impact on tumor phenotype. We have found significant differences in phosphorylation of kinases in response to Hras versus Braf activation. Hras activation leads to increased phosphorylation of mTOR effectors, while Braf activation increases CREB activation. Studies are ongoing to identify the molecular mechanism of these observed differences. We have also shown a significant decrease in the growth of HrasG12V/Ptenhom (p=0.0009) and BrafV600E/Ptenhom (p=0.0001) cells treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, suggesting that activated Hras or Braf-even in the context of Pten loss-partially relies on MAPK signaling to reach its full oncogenic potential. We have recently employed a PCR array approach to identify differences in the expression of genes related to the MAPK pathway in HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom cell lines. We noted an up-regulation of Myc, Cdkn1a, and Sfn in BrafV600E/Ptenhom cells in comparison to HrasG12V/Ptenhom cells, which may contribute to the different pathophysiology of HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom tumor sub-types.

A number of recurrent leukemogenic gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and clinically validated in AML. However, nearly 50% of AML patient samples lack any known AML driver mutations. Advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of novel and actionable gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements in these AML samples. The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene is one such rearrangement identified in samples from patients with AML. Fusion of ETV6 sequences to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 results in constitutive activation of the TRKC kinase and ETV6-NTRK3 expression has emerged as one of the key oncodrivers for leukemogenesis. Constitutive activation of TRK family tyrosine kinases has also been detected in a wide range solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, highly potent and selective kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency against TRKA/B/C, ROS1 and ALK kinase activities (encoded by NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively). In these studies, we have demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib in AML cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and survival in vitro with sub-nanomolar EC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein as well as phosphorylation of known TRKC downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Sensitivity to entrectinib was dependent on expression of the TRKC fusion protein. In xenograft models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression, which was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. The clinical relevance of activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements has been validated by the efficacy of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with NTRK rearranged acute myeloid leukemias and provide rationale for the clinical development of entrectinib in molecularly defined hematologic malignancies.

        "Background":"['Metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare, but often aggressive, thyroid malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of 28% and few effective therapeutic options. Adoptive T-cell immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CARTs) is showing encouraging results in the treatment of cancer, but development is challenged by the availability of suitable target antigens. We identified glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor alpha 4 (GFR4), which associates with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, as a putative antigenic target for CAR-based therapy of MTC. Using RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope) and quantitative RT-PCR, we show that GFR4 is highly expressed in MTC. Normal tissue expression of GFR4 mRNA is restricted to parafollicular cells (C-cells) within the thyroid, the normal cell type from which MTC originates, and normal thymus.Based upon the highly restricted expression, we generated two high affinity single chain variable fragments (scFvs) targeting GFR4 isoforms a and b by selecting a nave rabbit antibody library by phage display. Second generation CARs bearing the CD137 costimulatory domain were constructed using these GFR4-specific scFvs. GFR4-specific CARTs trigger antigen-dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine production in vitro, and they are able to control pre-established TT cell tumors in an immunodeficient mouse xenograft model of MTC. These data demonstrate the feasibility of targeting GFR4 by CARTs, and support this molecule as a promising target for adoptive T cell immunotherapy and other antibody-based therapy of MTC.']",

We describe a diagnostically challenging and rapidly fatal case of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurring in a young, morbidly obese man presenting with diffuse bone marrow involvement and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Whole-exome (WES) and shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) were carried out for the primary tumour, adjacent normal, bone marrow tissues, multiple metastases and blood samples derived from the patient. We identified three germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the RET proto-oncogene that remained undetected using routine hospital genetic testing procedures. One variant (L769L) has been previously reported to be associated with aggressive MTC presentation yet remains untested for in the routine diagnosis of MTC. Supported by findings from both WES and sWGS, we report for the first time in thyroid cancer on the occurrence of a “chromothripsis-like pattern”, which involved shattering of chromosome 4 leading to complete abrogation of normal chromosomal function, along with dramatic widespread copy number aberrations across both primary tumour and bone marrow samples. Based on the somatic variants identified, we describe the evolutionary pathway of the case, showing that bone marrow metastasis occurred separately to other metastatic sites. The presence of disease-associated SNPs within the RET proto-oncogene supports their inclusion as part of routine genetic testing for MTC cases. The copy number aberrations and chromothripsis-like pattern affected a much broader range of genes than single mutations and may have led to the widespread chromosomal instability evident, possibly contributing to the rapid fatal course of the case.

        "Background":"[\"One of the hallmarks of human cancers is the intrinsic or acquired resistance to apoptosis. Apoptosis resistance contributes to carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and treatment resistance. Patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have been shown to be resistant to standard chemotherapy and conventional radiotherapy. Dominant activating mutations in the RET protooncogene are the cause of hereditary MTC and are found in more than 40% of sporadic cases. Despite an ever-growing wealth of information about RET's role in cell survival/proliferation, a detailed understanding of how this tyrosine kinase receptor acts to prevent cell death in tumorigenesis remains elusive. We hypothesized that activated RET prevents apoptosis by repressing the transcription of the proapoptotic gene Noxa in the nucleus in response to genotoxic or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.Here we report that activated RET translocates to the nucleus in cultured MTC cells as well as MTC primary tumor tissues. RET is recruited to the Noxa promoter and is able to repress its transcription. The formation of the RET-Noxa promoter complex depends on RET expression and requires the tyrosine kinase activity of RET. Additionally, stable depletion of RET in MTC cells, using lentiviral shRNA, sensitizes MTC cells to genotoxic or endoplasmic reticulum stress. We specifically show that RET is recruited to the Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) binding site on the Noxa promoter. RET physically interacts with ATF4 and phosphorylates ATF4 leading to the blockage of its transcriptional activity. Moreover, RET knockdown is associated with increased ATF4-dependent expression of Noxa. Inhibition of RET kinase activity by sunitinib results in ATF4 activation, induction of Noxa expression and apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of ATF4 in MTC cells decreased sunitinib-mediated Noxa induction and apoptosis. ATF4 protein levels markedly decreased and/or localized in the cytoplasm of 60% of primary MTC (n=40) and associated with poor overall survival.Our data suggest that RET activating mutations confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents by preventing apoptosis through inhibition of ATF4 activity and repression of proapoptotic gene Noxa. These findings reveal the importance of nuclear localization of RET, as newly discovered modulator of nuclear gene expression. This newly identified interaction between RET kinase and ATF4 has important implication for MTC and other RET/ATF4-mediated cancer types. Since ATF4 transcription is induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activation of ATF4 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, the concept of promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors could be considered as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.\"]",

Treatment with NFV (1M to 10M for 48 hours) did not affect expression of HSP90 or levels of total AKT and ERK. In contrast, pAKT and pERK were inhibited in TT cells after treatment with NFV (5M and 10 M). Since both AKT and ERK pathways contribute to regulation of p70S6K/pS6 activity, we examined activation of this signaling axis. NFV (10M) decreased the level of p-p70S6K, p-pS6 and down-regulated Cyclin D1. Growth experiments demonstrated that the number of viable cells decreased by 30% and 85% after treatment with NFV at concentration 5M and 10M, respectively. Microscopy showed that exposure to NFV was associated with cell rounding and nuclear fragmentation, suggesting induction of apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that NFV induced caspase 3 cleavage in TT cells. In addition, treatment with NFV was associated with induction of H2AX, indicating DNA damage. Immunostaining of human MTC showed increased expression of HSP 90 in 5/12 of examined MTCs compared to corresponding normal thyroid tissue. The highest level of cytoplasmic HSP90 was detected in 3 cases of MTC harboring RET mutation, and co-localization staining showed that cells with high level of HSP90 expression also exhibited prominent pAKT and pERK. Conclusion. Treatment of MTC cell with clinically achievable concentrations of NFV results in down-regulation of AKT and ERK signaling and inhibition of MTC cell growth. Expression of HSP90 in human tumors suggests that it has a role in maintenance of anti-apoptotic signaling in MTC cells. Together these data support the potential utility of NFV for the treatment of patients with MTC.']",

        "Meeting_name":" RET and integrin crosstalk provides functional plasticity",
        "Background":"['The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. RET becomes activated upon formation of a complex with the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand and GDNF-family receptor (GFRa), which leads to activation of multiple downstream signalling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK, STAT3, and SRC. Constitutive activation of RET, through translocations or missense mutations, leads to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), respectively. Also, RET expression has been detected in pancreatic and breast cancers, and has been linked to increased metastatic potential. In order to clarify the underlying role of RET in tumour progression, we examined the relationship between RET and two integrin subunits, 1 (ITGB1) and 3 (ITGB3). Integrin proteins are important for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and focal adhesion (FA) formation. Functionally, integrins are important for cell-adhesion and migration as they provide traction and leverage for cell movement. Previously, we have shown that RET is able to increase cell-migration and adhesion, and that both ITGB1 and ITGB3 are important for these processes. Here, we show that RET-mediated cell-migration is persistent over 24 hours, and that patterns of cell-adhesion fluctuate over this time, predictably representing different forces needed to move across the microenvironment. Cell-adhesion is increased upon 1 hour of GDNF treatment, but is lost between 3-12 hours of GDNF treatment. Interestingly, we observed that ITGB1 activation downstream of RET, detected by co-immunoprecipitation with paxillin, is transient, and lasts for 1 hour. Conversely, ITGB3 activation downstream of RET, detected using an active heterodimer-specific antibody, is sustained between 1-12 hours of GDNF treatment. These results demonstrate unique functional roles for ITGB1 and ITGB3 downstream of RET. We also examined the importance of signalling pathways downstream of RET for integrin activation, and found that, in a 2D collagen environment, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK are important for RET-mediated FA formation. However, in a 3D collagen environment where cells formed spheroids, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 are important for cell-outgrowth, downstream of RET activation. This likely represents different cellular responses needed to overcome environment-specific obstacles. Finally, we showed evidence for a relationship between RET, ITGB1 and ITGB3 in tumour progression using a cohort of various clinically annotated thyroid cancer samples. Ultimately, we have shown a role for in activation of two integrin subunits, ITGB1 and ITGB3, downstream of RET and how each of these proteins may contribute to metastatic events, particularly those involved in thyroid cancer.']",

        "Background":"[\"Neuroendocrine (NE) cancers originate from secretory cells of the body's various endocrine structures. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for these tumors. However, the majority of NE cancers are metastatic at the time of detection and no effective adjuvant therapies exist for primary NE tumors or their metastases. Patients often develop two or more NE cancers, a syndrome termed multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). DNA sequencing has lead to breakthroughs in the identification of the causes of familial forms of the four types of MEN syndromes. Mutations in a protein of unknown function, menin, are associated with MEN1. Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET are linked to MEN2 and MEN3. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, CDNK1B, is mutated in MEN4. Unfortunately, a large percentage of NE cancers are sporadic, resulting from somatic mutations, and a high percentage of these do not harbor menin, RET, or CDNK1B mutations. Due to the lack of development of successful adjuvant therapies there has been little improvement in survival rates of NE cancer patients in the past several decades. Thus, there is a great need for the elucidation of signaling molecules that promote NE tumorigenesis in order to guide the development of novel and effective treatments for this family of cancers.Our laboratory has found that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an important tumorigenic signaling molecule in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a type of NE cancer that originates from calcitonin-producing C cells in the thyroid. New data supports a role for Cdk5 in multiple types of NE cancer and provides a new prospective from which to explore their causes. Cdk5 is expressed in many NE cancers and inhibition of Cdk5 activity blocks growth of NE cancer cell lines. Phosphoproteomic analysis of growing versus arrested MTC tumors, induced by expression of the Cdk5 activator p25 in our transgenic mouse model of MTC, revealed elevation of over 200 phosphorylation sites. We have used short interfering peptides (SIPs) to selectively target a set of these phosphorylation sites and found that 15 of these SIPs blocked growth of NE cancer cell lines. Phosphorylation state specific antibodies were generated to several of these sites and phosphorylation levels were confirmed to be decreased in arrested MTC tumors. In conclusion, 1) multiple types of NE cancer cells are dependent on Cdk5 activity for growth, 2) phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins is elevated downstream of Cdk5, and 3) select inhibition of these pathways blocks growth of NE cancer cells.Future studies will focus on analysis of these phosphoproteins in human NE tumors to validate of them as biomarkers for targeted cancer therapies as well as exploration of these phosphoproteins as direct targets for developing new therapeutics that are effective against NE cancers.\"]",

The calibration curve was linear from 2.5 to 250 ng/mL with a lower limit of quantitation at 5.7 ng/mL. Intraday and interday CV (%) for unbound vandetanib ranged from 2.7 to 6.5% and from 5.6 to 6.9%, respectively. Median unbound vandetanib serum levels evaluated in MTC patients indicated a progressive rise from 50 ng/ml (at 1 week) to 70 ng/ml (at 3 months) that persisted over time. Mean percentage of unbound vandetanib was 8%, in agreement with literature. Six of the 13 patients presented serious adverse events that required treatment interruption and/or dose reduction within 3 months of treatment. As expected, 3 patients with adverse events had a serum vandetanib level higher by more than 20% above the median level during the first 3 months of treatment. Interestingly, one patient with serious adverse event presented higher unbound vandetanib levels than the other patients, but its total vandetanib level was not increased.Conclusion', ' The steady state unbound vandetanib level is close to 70 ng/mL and total and unbound fraction may be relevant for therapeutic monitoring. Relationship between free fraction levels and adverse events is currently under investigation on a larger cohort of patients.']",

Germline activating point mutations of RET are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), an inherited cancer syndrome characterized by development of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma and parathyroid hyperplasia and are present in circa 50% of sporadic cases of MTC. More recently, a chromosomal rearrangement of the RET gene was identified in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas (1-2%) which is reported to result in expression of a fusion protein containing constitutively active RET kinase domain fused to the N-terminal portion of the kinesin KIF5B.We recently presented data on NMS-173, a very potent RET inhibitor characterized by an excellent in vivo activity profile upon i.v. administration. Here we describe the identification and the preclinical characterization of NMS-616, a novel analogue belonging to the same chemical class, suitable for oral administration. NMS-616 is a highly potent (IC50', ' 2 nM), ATP competitive RET inhibitor, characterized by high selectivity when tested against a panel of more than 50 kinases. NMS-616 potently blocked proliferation of MTC cell lines, such as the TT human cell line, which endogenously harbours constitutively activated RET, concomitant with abrogation of RET autophosphorylation and signaling pathway activation. The compound also inhibited the IL-3 independent proliferation of RET-driven Ba/F3 cells, with down-modulation of RET autophosphorylation and downstream signalling pathways. NMS-616 is characterized by a good in vitro ADME profile and in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters in the mouse, including oral bioavailability. When tested in vivo in a murine subcutaneous xenograft model employing TT cells, NMS-616 displayed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition following daily oral administration at 50 and 100 mg/Kg, with tumor regression observed at both dose levels. In addition ex vivo analysis demonstrated dose-dependent target modulation following a single administration and the maintenance of RET phosphorylation inhibition for at least 24 hours.']",

Activating mutations in RET (C634W and M918T) have been identified in both familial and sporadic forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and correlate with aggressive disease progression, validating RET as a classical oncogene. Furthermore the recent identification of RET fusions (CCDC6-RET and KIF5B-RET) present in 1% of lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) patients has renewed interest in the identification and development of more selective RET inhibitors lacking the toxicities associated with the current treatments.At present, there are no known specific RET inhibitors in clinical development, although many potent inhibitors of RET have been identified opportunistically through selectivity profiling of compounds initially designed to target other TKs. Such secondary RET inhibitors include the clinical agents Vandetanib and Cabozantinib, both approved for use in MTC, but additional pharmacological activities (most notably inhibition of KDR) lead to dose-limiting toxicity.Using a robust screening cascade developed in house, we have measured RET and KDR inhibitory activity in vitro and in relevant cell line models to assess compound potency and selectivity. Anti-proliferative activity and off-target toxicity of these agents have also been measured. Although these competitor compounds displayed reasonable RET potency in cellular assays and this translated into anti-proliferative effects in our MTC and LAD disease models, as expected none met our target candidate criteria, clearly highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with improved selectivity.Guided by structure-based drug design, we have identified and optimised a novel series of potent and selective inhibitors of the RET kinase domain. These agents met our stringent criteria for enzyme and cell selectivity and, whilst potent in a RET-driven cell line, display little overt toxicity in a matched non-RET driven cell line.

Notably, with other tyrosine kinases, mutations in the kinase domains or gatekeeper residues alter drug sensitivity. We evaluated the effect of these RET mutations on the response to TKIs in a cell based system. Methods', ' CHO cells expressing WT and mutant RET proteins were treated with a panel of TKIs consisting of compounds in preclinical development (DP-2490 and DP-3636) and drugs being studied for treatment of MTC in clinical trials (axitinib, motesanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, vandetanib). Drug sensitivity was determined by inhibition of RET kinase phosphorylation and IC50s were calculated using photodensitometry. Results', ' The IC50s of each TKI against the different RET mutants are presented in the Table. WT RET was most sensitive to all of the TKIs. DP-2490 and DP-3636 had IC50s < 1 nM against WT RET, and demonstrated superior potency against all of the RET mutants tested.

Conclusions', ' RET kinase is a therapeutic target for the treatment of MTC. Here, we demonstrate that RET kinase inhibition differs by RET genotype and kinase inhibitor.

Also in those MTC and CRPC cases where there was no detectable growth for a period of time, restoration of growth was consistent with expansion of a pre-existing, inherently-resistant clone, growing at a constant rate, rather than with emergence of a clone that has acquired resistance. In cases where therapy continued well beyond a year (median, 25%-75%', ' 498, 420-727 days) until just before death (interval duration median, 25% to 75%', ' 95, 63-129 days), there was neither evidence of acceleration nor the slowing that would be predicted by a Gompertz model.

Modeling their survival data and their tumor growth rates suggested a return to the pre-therapy rate when treatment was discontinued. Conclusion', ' Data obtained on tumor growth rates for 2250 patients receiving therapy in clinical trials shows little evidence that tumor growth rates change while patients receive treatment.

It is highly expressed in high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell NEC (LCNEC), but is not expressed in normal tissue. DLL3 is expressed in melanoma, glioblastoma (GBM), neuroendocrine prostate, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), and other solid cancers. Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting DLL3, composed of a DLL3-specific IgG1 monoclonal antibody joined to a toxic DNA cross-linking agent by a cleavable linker. Rova-T binds to DLL3 on target-expressing cells, is internalized and cleaved, releasing the toxin to induce cell death. A Phase 1 study of Rova-T in SCLC showed encouraging antitumor activity in DLL3-high patients (pts), and was well-tolerated (Rudin et al., Lancet Oncol, 2016).

Recently, a translocation that results in formation of a KIF5B-RET fusion gene has been identified in 1-2% of NSCLCs. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with potent activity against BCR-ABL being investigated in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Previously, ponatinib has been shown to potently inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of RET and the viability of Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence through expression of a RET kinase domain artificially-activated via fusion to the TEL dimerization domain. Here, the activity of ponatinib was examined in Ba/F3 cells transformed with the most common, naturally-occurring activated variants of RET found in MTC and NSCLC. In addition, the activity of ponatinib was compared to that of 4 other multi-targeted TKIs with anti-RET activity in clinical development', ' vandetanib, cabozantinib, sunitinib and sorafenib.Results', ' Ponatinib potently inhibited viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing RETC634R, RETM918T and KIF5B-RET, with IC50s of 2, 3, and 11 nM, respectively. Consistent with these effects being due to inhibition of RET, ponatinib inhibited RET phosphorylation with similar potency in each respective cell line (IC50s of 4, 2, and 9 nM). The TKIs vandetanib (IC50', ' 448, 357 and 773 nM, respectively), cabozantinib (226, 100 and 292 nM), sunitinib (299, 312 and 570 nM) and sorafenib (>1000, 372 and 861 nM) also inhibited viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing RETC634R, RETM918T and KIF5B-RET, however the potency of all 4 TKIs was substantially reduced compared to that of ponatinib. Importantly, trough ponatinib concentrations (64 nM) observed in patients treated once daily with ponatinib (45 mg) substantially exceed IC50s for inhibition of each of the mutationally-activated RET variants. Additional studies to further evaluate the anti-RET activity of ponatinib and other TKIs, including their susceptibility to mutation-based resistance, are ongoing and will be presented.Conclusion', ' Ponatinib is a highly potent inhibitor of activated variants of RET found in MTC and NSCLC.

The transcriptional inhibitor of the RET gene was initially screened from the NCI chemical libraries using the cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay, which has a promoter sequence identical to the RET promoter. As a result of our screening effort, a small molecule, nonactin, has been identified as a potential lead compound, downregulating the transcriptional activity of the RET gene promoter. The effect of this molecule in the downregulation of the RET mRNA levels and the protein levels was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blotting respectively. We also observed that Egr1 expression is downergulated in a dose dependent manner by this small molecule, which is in correlation with the RET downregulation. The RET promoter has a highly conserved GC rich region, which acts as a binding site for Egr-1, which is involved in the transcription of many growth factor genes.

Since these mutations are known to induce oncogenic activation of RET tyrosine kinase, various therapeutic strategies interfering with the oncogenic function of RET protein have been developed and tested for treating RET-associated cancers in several preclinical and clinical studies. Our previous study has demonstrated that the G-rich strand in the polypurine/polypyrimidine (pPu/pPy) region of the RET proximal promoter is capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplex structures in vitro in the presence of K+, which can be further stabilized by a G-quadruplex interactive agents. Thus, the detailed mechanism by which G-quadruplex structures regulate RET transcription has been studied using mutation analysis and promoter reporter assays together with a detailed analysis of transcription factor binding to the RET promoter in vivo. To this end, we have explored the Flp-In cell system using homologous recombination, which allows integration of a single copy of a wild type or G-quadruplex-mutant RET promoterluciferase construct into a specific genomic recombination locus (FRT site) in a host Flp-In the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line. Thus, differences in reporter expression levels from isolated isogenic cell clones can be ascribed more confidently to promoter-specific effects, rather than enhancer/silencer artifacts due to variations in integration sites.

Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 1 (NTRK1), the cognate receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), has been reported in 7 tumor types as a NTRK1 kinase domain fused with several reported partners including the 5 coiled-coil domain of the tropomysin TPM3 gene. The resultant NTRK1 fusion protein is present in about 1.5% of colorectal cancer (CRC), 3% of lung and 12% of papillary thyroid cancers.

Angiogenesis does not only depend on endothelial cell invasion and proliferation', ' it also requires pericyte coverage of vascular sprouts for vessel stabilization. These processes are coordinated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A significant portion of research on tumor angiogenesis has focused on VEGF and its blockage with the expectation that dramatic results would be demonstrated in cancer patients as previously documented in animal models. Vandetanib, also known as ZD6474, is an antagonist of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or HER1 or ErbB1). It is an orally bioavailable small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of multiple growth factors, and is now available in the US for the treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Methods', ' ZD 6474 monomer was purchased modified to add a fluorescent dye (6-FAM). Its coupled ZD 6474 dimer was also prepared using a PEG linker, similarly with FAM fluorescent dye. The two compounds were compared in a series of in vitro studies using human endothelial cell (HUVECs) and several cancer cell lines. We first looked at VEGFR binding affinity and specificity with cell uptake and blocking study.

Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gene fusions exist across a multitude of tumor types and that known fusions are not always confined to the disease in which they appear most often.

While tumors harboring ALK fusions are highly sensitive to crizotinib, emerging data have demonstrated that individuals with ROS1 or RET fusions may also benefit from inhibitors targeting these two kinases. A new oncogenic fusion involving NTRK1 that can be targeted by kinase inhibitors has been recently described. The two main methods to identify translocations, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) are labor intensive and sensitivity is rather low. Common sample types for lung cancer analysis are biopsies making the study of more than one fusion gene rather difficult. In this study we aimed to develop and validate a workflow based on AmpliSeq technology to comprehensively profile ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 chromosomal translocations in lung tumors. Two hundred lung cancer retrospective samples, including tumor biopsy, were collected from 12 laboratories - the OncoNetwork Consortium. All the samples were previously characterized by orthologous techniques (FISH, IHC, RT-PCR and/or MassArray). More than 30 ALK positive samples were selected. The panel targets over 70 fusion transcripts associated with ALK, RET, ROS1, and NTRK1 genes. The panel also includes 5 and 3 gene expression assays for each gene as indicators of a translocation event and assays for 5 internal control genes. The workflow is compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, requiring only 10ng of total RNA and able to multiplex up to 16 libraries on a single Ion 318 chip. A dedicated data analysis pipeline using the Ion Reporter software 4.2 was evaluated. Serial dilutions of cell lines RNA harboring known fusion events, in normal RNA showed that the methodology had 1% mutant RNA limit of detection. A second dilution experiment using RNA extracted from FFPE lung fusion positive samples diluted in a negative FFPE sample showed a detection limit of 15%.

Concordance study was performed using 200 FFPE samples previously characterized with standard method. A concordance of >98% was obtained between the methodologies. The discordant results are currently under study. A negative FFPE samples was run as single test on an Ion 318 chip on to evaluate the possibility of false positive results due to high number of reads. No false positive was detected in this experiment.
