        "Background":"['The INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus on human chromosome 9p21 is a hot spot genomic region that undergoes frequent inactivation or deletion in a wide spectrum of human cancers. The locus encodes three cell cycle inhibitory proteins', ' p15INK4b encoded by CDKN2b, p16INK4a encoded by CDKN2a and p14ARF (p19Arf in mice) encoded by an alternative reading frame (ARF) of CDKN2a. We have recently identified a homologous INK4 genomic locus in zebrafish that is surprisingly devoid of ARF sequences, and encodes a single zebrafish ink4ab gene that functions to activate stress-induced senescence. Therefore, evolution of the mammalian INK4 locus to include multiple tumor suppressors sharing regulatory features could attribute to stronger mechanisms of tumor suppression in these longer-lived vertebrates. Oxidative and/or oncogenic stress provokes cellular senescence involving the retinoblastoma (Rb) and ARF/p53 pathways, leading to silencing of growth-promoting genes by methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) with the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. We found that ink4ab deficient zebrafish had deregulated Rb signaling and senescence responses, and reduced suv39h1 expression levels that led to poor overall survival. Ink4ab deficient zebrafish had increased lymphocyte proliferation, splenomegaly, and developed multiple spontaneous tumors including metastatic melanoma, osteosarcoma, hepatocellular adenoma, leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders. Moreover, zebrafish heterozygous for both p53 and ink4ab mutations displayed significantly higher tumor incidence compared to p53 heterozygotes with wild-type ink4ab, indicating that ink4ab haploinsufficiency promotes tumorigenesis. To this end, the combined deficiency of ink4ab and p53 accelerates tumor latency, likely by reversing cellular senescence responses. To further examine ARF-independent senescence regulatory roles of INK4 products in a mammalian model, we have generated conditional mice deficient for all three INK4 open reading frames in the adult hematopoietic system. Within seven months, homozygous Ink4a/Ink4b/ARF-/- mice exhibited marked splenomegaly and developed spontaneous tumors, including leukemias and soft tissue sarcomas. Peripheral blood, splenic and bone marrow analyses of homozygous mutant mice showed deregulated lymphocyte development, uncontrolled proliferation, apoptosis and Suv39h1-dependent senescence when compared to heterozygous and wild type mice. These results identify ARF-independent and Suv39h1-dependent senescence regulatory and tumor suppressor mechanisms whose inactivation permits tumor formation in response to oncogenic and/or oxidative stress. Our models offer the opportunity to reveal novel paradigms for promoting cellular senescence as an alternative strategy for cancer prevention and therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Adults in the US are now 28 times more likely to develop melanoma than 75 years ago. Among other genetic abnormalities, mutations in the INK4a locus on chromosome 9p21 are prominent in melanoma and can be found in nearly 50% of familial cases. Two independent tumor suppressors which are transcribed from the INK4a locus, p16 (CDKN2A) and ARF (p14ARF), share common exons 2 and 3 but are translated in unique reading frames. p16 causes cell cycle and growth arrest in the G1 phase by binding cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), thereby displacing Cyclin D1 and inhibiting the enzymes. ARF, meanwhile, causes cell cycle and growth arrest in the G1 and G2/M phases by binding MDM2, in turn stabilizing p53. Mutations in melanoma often affect one or both genes, suggesting p16 and ARF may play equally important roles in tumor suppression. We report a 2 bp deletion, 1 bp insertion (CC to T) in exon 2 of p16/ARF found in a melanoma cell line that alters the reading frames of both genes and creates unique proteins. One transcript initiates from the ARF promoter and codes for the first 94 amino acids of ARF before switching to the reading frame of p16 to code for another 75 residues. We named the resulting protein chimera ARF (chARF). The other transcript initiates from the p16 promoter, codes for the first 80 amino acids of p16, then switches to a non-p16/non-ARF reading frame to code for an additional 63 residues. We called this protein p16-Alternate Carboxyl Terminus (p16-ACT). Based on sequence, we hypothesized that chARF could function both as ARF and p16 since it contains the MDM2 binding domain of ARF as well as most of the CDK4/6 binding domain of p16. Meanwhile, we hypothesized that p16-ACT would have no function since it is missing most of the CDK4/6 binding region of p16. To assess the function of these proteins, we overexpressed both mutant and wild-type proteins in the p16/ARF-inactivated tumor cell line U2OS. In CDK4 immunoprecipitation assays, chARF bound CDK4, but unlike wild-type p16, did not displace Cyclin D1. p16-ACT neither bound CDK4 nor displaced Cyclin D1. chARF expression strongly activated the p53/p21 pathway and arrested U2OS cells in the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in a manner identical to wild-type ARF. p16-ACT, however, had no noticeable effect on cell cycle distribution. Finally, we looked at cell proliferation and found that chARF expression suppressed monolayer cell growth and colony formation in U2OS cells by 75-85%, similar to wild-type ARF. p16-ACT expression had a small suppressive effect on colony formation, but no effect on monolayer growth. We conclude that chARF functions as wild-type ARF but neither chARF nor p16-ACT function as wild-type p16.']",

        "Background":"['Concurrent inactivation of the p16Ink4a and p53 tumor suppressors, often through mutation of CDKN2A and TP53, is frequent in early development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers. The role of this early combined inactivation, and the oncogenic drivers that subsequently lead to tumor development, are poorly defined. To characterize the precancerous role of concurrently mutated CDKN2A and TP53, we combined a number of recent advances to disrupt both loci in primary cells. First, we grew primary keratinocytes in medium conditioned by irradiated J2-3T3 cells and containing an inhibitor of ROCK kinases, conditions that greatly extend their normally limited proliferative potential. Second, we transfected primary keratinocytes with plasmid vectors expressing both Cas9 and sets of guide RNAs targeting specific regions of CDKN2A and TP53. We targeted either or both of the p14Arf and p16Ink4a protein products of CDKN2A for knockout (KO), together with either TP53 KO or a TP53 point mutation (R248Q protein product), two major categories of genetic alterations of p53 in HNSCC. Third, we evaluated use of nutlin-3, an inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction, to try to select against cells that still contained wild-type p53. We assessed KO efficiency by PCR of genomic DNA; the TP53 point mutation introduced a SauA3i site into TP53. Two weeks of nutlin-3 treatment led to a 3 fold increase in p53 KO efficiency versus untreated cells (50% versus 14%). p16Ink4a KO efficiencies were enhanced 2 to 14 fold after nutlin-3 treatment, depending on the specific Cas9/guide-RNA constructs used. In cells transfected to produce p53 R248Q, 14% of PCR products amplifying the mutated region after nutlin-3 exposure showed Sau3Ai digestion, whereas no Sau3Ai digestion was detected in untreated cells. This result suggests that up to 14% of nutlin-3 treated keratinocytes had integrated the mutated donor oligo sequence. We similarly enrich for mutated keratinocytes having p14Arf-specific or combined CDKN2A KO along with TP53 KO or mutation. Combined transfection to generate concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations under conditions that allow extended proliferation in culture, followed by selection for successful TP53 mutation with nutlin-3, will facilitate identification of keratinocyte clones with bi-allelic knockout genotypes. This panel of keratinocytes with concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations will help delineate the roles of these genes in early cancer development and will allow screening for the oncogenic drivers required for tumor development and metastasis, with emphasis on discovering more effective and specific druggable targets for improving treatment.']",

The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14ARF and p16. We now show that p14ARF (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REG. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knock-down of REG or by pharmacological blockade of its nuclear export. Thus our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of two key tumor suppressors mediated by a REG-dependent mechanism.']",

In gastric carcinogenesis, chronic inflammation and histopathologic progression of the stomach epithelium lead to the development of metaplasia and eventually adenocarcinoma. Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is one of the preneoplastic lesions in the stomach and is triggered by the loss of parietal cells that secrete gastric acid. The Ink4a/Arf locus encodes two structurally unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) in mice.

Results', ' In K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the increase of p19 expression were observed in gastric epithelium along with the parietal cells loss leading to SPEM development.

Furthermore, treatment of tamoxifen, an inducer of parietal cells loss, in Ink4a/Arf (-/-) mice revealed that deletion of Ink4a/Arf locus suppresses parietal cells loss in mice.

Methods', ' Patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HNSCC were consented for donation of tumor at the time of surgery. Tumor tissue was obtained, washed in antibiotic rich media, manually disaggregated, and subcutaneously implanted into mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) for initial tumorgraft establishment. Subsequent mouse-to-mouse passages were performed and formalin-fixed/paraffin embedded as well as flash frozen tissue was harvested for subsequent molecular analyses. Expression of p16(Ink4a), p53, pRB, and EGFR was assessed by immunohistochemistry(IHC). HPV status and subtype was assessed using MY09/MY11 and GP5/GP6 degenerate nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Transcriptionally active HPV infection was assessed by qRT-PCR for the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7. Mutation status of p53 was assessed by PCR-based exon amplification and Sanger sequencing.

Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles of Notch have been implicated in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We investigated the functional consequences of Notch activation in head and neck as well as esophageal SCCs (HNSCC and ESCC). Methods', ' Primary tumor tissues annotated with known clinical outcomes were analyzed. Human esophageal cells immortalized with telomerase or human papilloma virus E6/E7 genes, their derivatives expressing mutant p53 and ESCC cell lines were stably transduced with ICN1, an active form of Notch1 in a regulatable manner (Tet-On system). Notch was inhibited by dominant negative mastermind-like1 (DNMAML1), a genetic pan-Notch inhibitor or -secretase inhibitors (GSI). 8xCSL-luciferase reporter was used to assess Notch-mediated transcriptional activity. RNA interference was done targeting either CSL or p16INK4A. Senescence was determined by cell growth inhibition and senescence-associated -galactosidase assays. Cell growth was tested in soft agar and immunodeficient mice. Gene expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results', ' In primary tumors, the active form of Notch1 (ICN1Val1744) was detected as intense nuclear staining of tumor cells in the invasive fronts in 29% of HNSCC (n=17) and 56% of ESCC (n=171). Nuclear ICN1Val1744 was significantly associated with a poor 5-year survival in postsurgical ESCC patients (n=115). In culture, ICN1 induced cellular senescence through CSL-dependent p16INK4A induction, which was antagonized by DNMAML1 or knockdown of either CSL or p16INK4A. Moreover, ICN1 failed to induce senescence in immortalized cells expressing E6/E7 or ESCC cells with a deleted INK4 locus. However, p53 mutation did not prevent ICN1-induced senescence. In soft agar and xenograft transplantation, ICN1 stimulated colony formation and tumor growth of ESCC cells that negated senescence. Histology revealed an increased number of less-differentiated tumor cells upon ICN1 induction. Moreover, GSI treatment of mice with xenografted ESCC cells resulted in tumor necrosis. Conclusions', ' These data indicate that Notch activation contributes to disease progression in ESCC. While ICN1 induces senescence, loss of p16INK4A-mediated senescence checkpoint point functions may be required in ICN1-mediated malignant transformation, thus providing a novel mechanistic insight into how Notch signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCCs.']",

All of the three products play a pivotal role in tumor suppression and are frequently deleted or inactivated in a wide spectrum of human cancers. Despite the critical role of the mammalian INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus in tumor suppression, its counterpart in zebrafish has not yet been characterized. Zebrafish is an advantageous vertebrate to model human cancers, specifically because of the high fecundity, the ease of performing high-throughput screens, and the genetic conservation with mammals. We identified a syntenic zebrafish ink4ab locus that consists of a single gene orthologous to both mammalian CDKN2a (INK4A) and CDKN2b (INK4B), and functions to activate senescence in response to oxidative stress. Utilizing morpholino targeted knockdown and zebrafish mutants for the ink4ab gene, we have developed a zebrafish model for tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that the zebrafish ink4ab gene functions as a tumor suppressor by controlling cell cycle regulation under stress. Senescence was activated by oxidative stress in wild type embryos but not in embryos with ink4ab deficiency when examined with a whole embryo senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA--gal) assay. Surprisingly, we find that ink4ab deficient embryos also display significantly higher levels of apoptosis than controls. We determined that the apoptosis associated with ink4ab deficiency is p53-dependent. Furthermore, ink4ab deficiency led to significantly lower survival rates, both overall and upon radiation. Ink4ab deficient zebrafish had splenomegaly, increased lymphocyte proliferation, and developed spontaneous tumors including metastatic melanoma, osteosarcoma, leukemia and myelodysplastic disorders. Thus, the zebrafish ink4ab protein functions as a tumor suppressor similarly to the human p15INK4B and p16INK4A. To study the upstream control of zebrafish ink4ab expression, we investigated the orchestrated regulation by the Bmi-1 oncogene, and identified bmi-1a as a repressor of ink4ab expression. Zebrafish heterozygous for both p53 and ink4ab mutations displayed significantly higher tumor incidence compared to p53 heterozygotes with wild-type ink4ab, indicating that ink4ab haploinsufficiency promotes tumorigenesis. To this end, the combined deficiency of ink4ab and p53 accelerates the latency and broadens the tumor spectrum including the formation of retinoblastoma. Collectively, the zebrafish ink4ab model of tumor suppression provides a platform to perform large-scale screens for small molecules that modulate tumorigenesis in the ink4ab deficient fish, and permit defining the genetic pathways of CDKN2a- and CDKN2b-mediated tumor suppression.']",

Indeed, invasive bladder cancer is a major clinical challenge since it is highly associated with postoperative recurrence and metastasis. Current treatments for those lethal forms of bladder cancer include systemic chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy; however, survival is poor since most patients develop resistance to the drugs within a short timeframe. Clearly, there is a need to identify novel therapeutic options for invasive bladder cancer as well as a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. We have been investigating mechanisms of drug resistance using genetically-engineered mouse models of invasive bladder cancer based on the combinatorial deletion of p53 and Pten in bladder epithelium. p53 and PTEN are frequently inactivated in human bladder cancers, particularly those with poor prognosis. Indeed, allograft tumors established from these mice responded initially to the treatment with cisplatin, docetaxel, or rapamycin but eventually developed resistance. We have observed that these p53; PTEN deficient tumors express robust levels of p19Arf, while targeted deletion of Arf retards the aquisition of resistance following drug treatment. The significance of this expression was further suggested by analysis of a published gene expression profile of human bladder cancers which revealed that high Arf expression is an independent predictor of poor survival of invasive bladder cancer patients. Furthermore, following drug treatment in the mouse model, the Arf-positive, compared to the Arf-negative, tumors were significantly enriched in extracellular matrix/integrin signaling gene signature consistent with activation of downstream PI3K-mTOR pathway, suggesting that a model for drug resistance is via PI3K pathway activation. We have observed similar results in human bladder cancer cell lines either following knock-down of p14Arf in J82 cells that express endogenous p14Arf or following forced expression of p14Arf in ARF-negative UMUC3 human bladder cancer cells, and in both cases it was coincident with deregulated activation of PI3K-mTOR pathway.

        "Background":"['We previously reported that tumor suppressor LZAP is lost in a portion of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and that LZAP inhibits NF-kB, while activating p53 in ARF-dependent and -independent fashions. The ability of LZAP to regulate p53 in the absence of ARF has been largely unexplored. Here, we show that LZAP depletion diminished expression of mutant and wild-type p53 protein. LZAP activity toward p53 was independent of ARF and the known p53 regulators, Wip1 and HDM2. Loss of LZAP decreased p53 translation and destabilized p53 protein due, at least partially, to increased nucleolin expression. Knockdown of LZAP abrogated p53 stabilization induced by ionizing radiation, and LZAP depletion protected wild-type p53 cells from radiation or chemotherapeutic agents, while rendering cells expressing mutant or no p53 more sensitive. In human HNSCC, LZAP levels correlated with p53 levels, and remarkably, tumors with low LZ were less likely to have p53 mutations. These data suggest that loss of LZAP represents a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation in human cancer. Given these findings, inhibition of LZAP activity toward p53 for patients with tumors harboring p53 mutations may represent a therapeutic strategy to simultaneously sensitize tumors while protecting normal tissues from radiation or chemotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['Cyclin D1 is a crucial regulator in mammalian cell cycle that binds to and activates CDK4/6, which is an kinase that drives cells to enter S phase. It has an important oncogenic role in breast cancer because the CCND1 gene is amplified in 15% of cases and its protein expression is elevated in up to 50% of cases. Previous studies demonstrate that cyclin D1 overexpression can cause pRb hyper-phosphorylation and therefore induce cell hyperproliferation, which can result in the development of mammary adenocarcinoma. In addition, cyclin D1 is found to contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting the activity of transcriptional factors via physical interaction. One of the affected transcriptional factors is called Dmp1, which acts as a tumor suppressor when receiving oncogenic signals. It activates Arf by binding to its promoter region, therefore causing Arf, p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in normal cells. Our recent study in MMTV-neu mice showed that loss of Dmp1 significantly accelerates mammary carcinogenesis. Although both Dmp1 and cyclin D1 play vital roles in breast cancer prevention and development respectively, the biological functions and significance of Dmp1-cyclin D1 interaction remains to be explored. To identify the impact of their interaction on the activation of p16Ink4a/ p19Arf promoters induced by cyclin D1, MEFs were overexpressed cyclin D1 and we found the endogenous p16Ink4a and p19Arf transcripts were increased up to 7 fold. However, their transcription level was not affected in Dmp1-null MEFs. Moreover, cyclin D1 mutant 142-253 that cannot bind to Dmp1could not fully activate the p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters, indicating the activation of p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters by cyclin D1 is dependent on Dmp1, and loss of Dmp1-cyclin D1 interaction will attenuate this effect. To identify the potential regulation of p16Ink4a by Dmp1, we performed EMSA and luciferase reporter assay, and we found that Dmp1 activates the p16Ink4a promoter by directly binding to its promoter. Moreover, the p16Ink4a mRNA and protein level were increased upon Dmp1 overexpression. The above results suggest that Dmp1 is a physiological regulator of p16Ink4a. To explore the effect of Dmp1 on Cdk4 kinase activity, 293T cells were overexpressed cyclin D1 alone or together with Dmp1, and we found there was less cyclin D1 associated with CDK4 after CDK4 immunoprecipitation. As a consequence, pRb phosphorylation was decreased in CDK4 kinase assay. These results suggest that Dmp1 decreases CDK4 kinase activity by impairing cyclin D1-CDK4 interaction. Taken together, our data suggest that Dmp1 decreases pRb phosphorylation in two ways', ' one is to directly bind to and activate p16INK4a, and the other one is to block the CDK4 kinase activity by binding to cyclin D1. In addition, cyclin D1-Dmp1 interaction is indispensible in activation of p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters induced by cyclin D1.']",

We investigated a cohort of 134 OTSCC patients treated between 2002 to 2008 with combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, who have been comprehensively annotated for patient/tumour characteristics and outcome. 134 formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks representative of primary tumours prior to treatment were collected.

We assessed p16/CDKN2A expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), promoter methylation status by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, mutation status by Sanger sequencing, gene copy number variation by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and correlated each of these with patient outcome.Results. The majority of OTSCC demonstrated loss of p16 expression (107/118, 90.7%), assessed by IHC. The frequency of CDKN2A inactivating mutations was 20.3% (21/103), homozygous CDKN2A loss was 4.1% (7/98), hemizygous CDKN2A loss 30.6% (30/98), and CDKN2A promoter methylation >10% was 17.7% (20/113). 34/107(31.8%) p16 IHC negative tumours had no evidence of CDKN2A mutation, copy number variation or promoter methylation identified. Of eleven p16 IHC positive patients, only two demonstrated evidence of HPV type 16 and 33 on PCR. No correlation was identified between any of the mechanisms of CDKN2A inactivation and clinicopathological features.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Despite recent improved understanding of cancer, the 5-year survival rate for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains relatively unchanged. It is critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for NHSCC. Deregulation of CDKN2A (p16) or CCND1 (cyclin D1) occurs commonly in HNSCC and induces sustained cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 activation. In addition, HNSCC is characterized by persistent activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway that triggers a signaling cascade of cell proliferation and survival. Methods', ' HNSCC cell lines were tested for the CDK4/6 inhibitor LY2835219, alone and in combination with mTOR inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo. Results', ' The selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, LY2835219 inhibited CDK4/6-dependent Ser780 phosphorylation in retinoblastoma (RB) and induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition. In an animal xenograft model of HNSCC, LY2835219 treatment led to reduced tumor growth. However, because single-agent treatment with LY2835219 showed a limited effect in HNSCC, a combinational strategy is necessary for effective therapy. At the molecular level, we found that LY2835219 inhibited activation of AKT and ERK, but not mTOR. The combination of LY2835219 with mTOR inhibitor was found to be more effective than either drug alone in vitro and in vivo.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumorigenesis induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) shows a greater clinical response to radiation therapy when compared to HPV negative patients. The underlying mechanism for this more favorable outcome is unknown, but the presumption is that DNA repair response must play a large role. P16INK4a is a known surrogate marker for HPV positivity; however the relationship between radiation sensitivity and P16INK4a has not been completely elucidated in this context. Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitylating enzyme that cleaves ubiquitin from substrates to stabilize target proteins. USP7 overexpression is a predictor of poor prognosis in lung carcinomas and correlates with disease progression and lower survival in gliomas. More recent studies have shown USP7 has a role in the stability of DNA damage response proteins such as RNF168, BRCA1 and Chk1; and USP7 knockdown has been shown to radio-sensitize breast cancer cells to radiation. We have investigated the possible role of USP7 in the radio-response of HNSCC cells in the context of HPV status.Methods', ' Four HPV(+) and four HPV(-) HNSCC were chosen for this study. The radio-response was determined by clonogenic survival assay. P16INK4a overexpression was generated using lentivirus. Western blot analysis was used for visualizing protein expression. The Cancer Genome Atlas was interrogated to examine the relationship between USP7 and clinical outcome.Results', ' Our data suggest P16INK4a negatively regulates USP7 and leads to the more radiosensitive phenotype associated with HPV(+)HNSCC. Radio-resistant HPV(-) HNSCC cell lines show higher levels of USP7 than HPV(+) lines and over-expression of P16INK4a in HPV(-) HN5 cells leads to down-regulation of USP7 and radio-sensitization. Conversely, P16INK4a siRNA knockdown in HPV(+) UMSCC-47 shows an increase of USP7 protein expression and radio-resistance. P22077, an inhibitor of USP7 activity, was also shown to radiosensitize a HPV(-) cell line. This shows proof of principle that inhibiting USP7 can be a viable approach to sensitizing HPV(-) HNSCC to radiation. USP7 overexpression was also associated with poorer overall survival in HNSCC.Conclusion', ' These results suggest that USP7 may be a marker of clinical radioresistance in HNSCC and that its inhibition has the potential to improve the treatment outcome of patients with HPV(-) HNSCC when combined with radiotherapy.']",

Risk factors associated with HNSCC include smoking, alcohol use and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. With the decline in tobacco use, there has been an increase in the incidence of HPV-associated head and neck cancers. Our increased understanding of the mutational landscape demonstrates that HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC are molecularly distinct. Additionally, patients with HPV-positive tumors respond better to therapy and have better prognosis overall. However, there are no targeted therapies for HPV+ HNSCC. Human cell lines can serve as preclinical models for studying cancer progression and identifying possible therapeutic targets. Our aim was to determine if HNSCC tumors and cell lines derived from head and neck tumors display similar proteomic profiles. Methods', ' Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis was performed on 66 HNSCC cell lines. The HPV-status of these cell lines was determined by quantitative and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results', ' Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that 9 of the 66 cell lines were HPV-positive. Differential expression of 156 proteins was analyzed and proteomic pathway scores were determined by t-test in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines. We identified significant proteomic differences between HPV-positive and negative HNSCC cell lines. As observed in HPV-positive head and neck tumors, the clinical biomarker p16 was overexpressed in HPV-positive cell lines (p-value <0.0001). Furthermore, the expression of other cell cycle proteins p21 (p-value <0.0001) is lower in HPV-positive cell lines while cyclin E1 (p-value <0.03) and pRb (p-value <0.0001) are higher in HPV-positive cell lines. Similar to RPPA profiles of HNSCC tumors, HPV-positive cell lines show less epithelial to mesenchymal transition as indicated by lower levels of fibronectin and N-cadherin. When compared to HNSCC tumors, we also observed dysregulated expression of receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

HPV16 serology was determined using an immunoassay for the capsid protein L1, and multiplex serology based on the capsid protein L1 and the early oncoproteins E6/E7 for 488 patients. Immunohistochemical detection of p16 expression in tumors was performed in a subset of 233 cases, and we used two different methods to assess the presence of HPV16 DNA in a subset of 179 cases tumors.

Recent data suggest an increasing incidence rate among younger people who are often non-smokers and non-drinkers, which are believed to be caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.  HPV positive tumors are typically found in the oropharynx and have better response to treatment and better disease outcome despite more advanced nodal stages. Therefore, HPV-positive HNSCCs represent a unique clinical subgroup with a separate tumor entity.   Methods', '  Patients treated for HNSCC from 2002 to 2006 at UNC hospitals and had banked tissue available were eligible for this study. Tissue microarrays (TMA) were generated in triplicate. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for p16 was performed and scored separately for nuclear staining and cytoplasmic staining. Human papilloma virus (HPV) staining was also carried out using monoclonal antibody E6H4. P16 expression, HPV status and other clinical features were correlated with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results', '  135 patients had sufficient sample for this analysis. Median age of diagnosis was 57 years (range 20-82), with 68.9% males, 8.9% never smokers and 32.6 % never drinkers. 3 year OS rate and PFS rate was 63.0% and 54.1% respectively. Based on the p16 staining score, patients were divided into three groups', ' high nuclear any cytoplasmic staining group (HNAC), low nuclear low cytoplasmic staining group (LNLC) and low nuclear high cytoplasmic staining group (LNHC). HNAC and LNLC groups had significantly better overall survival than LNHC groups with hazard ratios of 0.01 and 0.37 respectively, after controlling for other factors, including HPV status. HNAC and LNLC groups also had better progression-free survival than LNHC group, although not significantly. A similar trend was observed in an independent patient population with comparable magnitude of effect.  Conclusions', '  Different p16 protein localization suggested different survival outcomes', ' high nuclear p16 staining is an indication of better survival while high cytoplasmic p16 staining signals poor survival outcome; and this effect is beyond the effect of HPV infection.']",

        "Background":"['In addition to serving crucial roles in bone development, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling contributes to the development and progression of many cancers, making it an attractive candidate for treatment of bone-resident cancers. Recent data suggest that Hh-targeted agents exert pluripotent effects on host bone microenvironment cells through both cell-intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms, interrupting the vicious cycle of tumor cell, osteoblast (OB), osteoclast (OC), and bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) interactions in bone metastatic breast cancers. Here, reciprocal stimulation between tumor cells and bone cells enhance both tumor growth and bone pathology. Similarly, development of osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone cancer, is strongly influenced by conditions within surrounding microenvironment providing additional points for therapeutic intervention.The 5-year survival rate for metastatic OS is under 30%, highlighting the need for novel and targeted treatments. We have demonstrated that mice deficient in the tumor suppressor ARF (p19ARF; p14ARF in humans) have enhanced rates of bone turnover, mimicking the adolescent growth period in which OS is prevalent. By crossing Arf-/- mice with those expressing Tax, an HTLV-1 oncogene that results in osteolytic tumors, we developed a model of high penetrant spontaneous OS that recapitulates many aspects of human disease. Here, suppression of bone turnover with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid prevented the development of OS, suggesting that enhanced OC activity may stimulate OS growth. In agreement, we found that Tax+Arf-/- OS had increased RANKL-to-OPG ratios resulting in increased osteoclastogenic ability. Compared to normal osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cell precursors, Tax+Arf-/- OS cells have increased expression of Hh pathway genes and exhibit increased susceptibility to Hh inhibitors (SMO antagonists). In particular, Tax+Arf-/- OS cells express high levels of the Hh ligands Sonic (SHH) and Indian (IHH), suggesting they may stimulate surrounding cells in a paracrine fashion. Notably, BMSC derived from non-tumor bearing Tax+Arf-/- mice also exhibit increased expression of pro-tumorigenic factors (including IL-6 and IGF), generating a fertile soil. SHH or conditioned media from Tax+Arf-/- OS cells enhanced OC activity and BMSC cell production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors. Furthermore, the increased OB and OC differentiation and activity present in Tax+Arf-/- cells could be abrogated with SMO inhibitors. We have established an OS cell line from Tax+Arf-/- mice (TAN) with the ability to form mineralized tumors upon intratibial injection. Using this model, we hypothesize that treatment with SMO antagonists will decrease OS growth due to both tumor cytotoxic effects and direct effects on host bone microenvironment cells that abrogate the pro-tumor microenvironment.']",

Obesity has been reported to be associated with the occurrence of larger, more advanced tumors and aggressive cancer pathological features, including lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage, and high grade. Accumulating recent evidence highlights the tumor-surrounding adipose tissue as a key component of breast cancer progression. However, the molecular basis of adipocyte-related breast carcinogenesis remains elusive. To shed light on this important phenomenon, we investigated the autocrine and paracrine roles of the tumor suppressor p16 INK4A protein in adipocytes. We have found that down-regulation of p16INK4A by specific shRNA in breast adipocytes enhanced their migration/invasion abilities and increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines including leptin. In addition, we have shown that p16INK4A protein inhibits the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal adipocytes in vitro and in tumor xenografts through repressing the expression/secretion of Leptin. Indeed, p16INK4A suppresses Leptin at the mRNA level. This effect is mediated trough miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, which inhibits Leptin expression through a specific sequence at the Leptin 3UTR. In addition, we present clear evidence that down-regulation of p16INK4A is sufficient to trans-activate breast stromal adipocytes, which promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition in normal breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent manner.These results provide the first indication that p16INK4A and miR-141 and miR-146b-5p represses Leptin and its procarcinogenic effects in breast stromal adipocytes.

Methylation array (Illumina infinium beadsarray) was applied to profile aberrant methylated CpG loci in HNSCC with lymph node invasiveness. Fourteen HNSCC tumors and two normal oral tissues were included.  value, the indicator of methylation status of each tested CpG locus, was derived with normalization.

We demonstrate the potential of a commercially available genomic platform to resolve this clinical dilemma. Methods', ' A 64-year-old 20 pack-year former smoking male with history of HPV-associated oropharyngeal (OP) cancer 4 years prior presented with an asymptomatic 4.5 cm right hilar mass on surveillance images.

In addition p16INK4a plays a crucial role in the process of replicative senescence. p16INK4a loss or inactivation is associated with predisposition to melanoma, pancreatic cancer and other malignancies, highlighting its recognized function as a tumor suppressor. Given its critical role in cell homeostasis, there is much interest in understanding the molecular regulators of p16INK4a expression.Here we report that p16 belongs to the expanding group of proteins whose translation is influenced by sequence/structural features of the 5UTR mRNA that are endowed of cellular Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) activity. To study the potential for p16INK4a 5UTR to drive cap-independent translation we developed a dual-luciferase assay using a bicistronic vector (named pRuF), where wild type or deletion mutants of the p16INK4a 5UTRs were cloned as intervening sequence between Renilla and Firefly luciferase cDNAs. The p16INK4a 5UTR sequence in inverted orientation was included as additional control. Results of reporters relative activity coupled to control analyses of actual bicistronic mRNA transcription, indicated that the wild type p16INK4a 5UTR could stimulate Firefly luciferase translation. The IRES-like activity could not be mapped to a specific region of the 5UTR based on results with deletion constructs, and was two-fold stronger compared to the cMYC 5UTR, a known cellular IRES used as a control. Notably, hypoxic stress in particular, but also the treatment with mTOR inhibitors, enhanced the translation-stimulating property of the p16INK4a 5UTR. RNA immuno-precipitation (RIP) assays performed in the p16-positive melanoma-derived cell line SK-Mel-28 suggest that the RNA-binding protein YBX-1, known to act in translation control, can participate in p16 INK4a translation. Experiments were YBX-1 was over-expressed or knocked-down by si-RNA confirmed its involvement in p16INK4a cap-independent translational regulation.

Cellular senescence is an extremely stable form of cell cycle arrest that limits the proliferation of damaged cells and may act as a natural barrier to cancer progression. MUC4, a high molecular weight glycoprotein, is overexpressed in many cancers and is implicated in cell proliferation, adhesion, anti-apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, migration and invasion of various carcinomas, but nothing is known about its clinical relevance and the mechanism through which it regulates cancer progression in HNSCC. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate clinical relevance and a potential role of MUC4 in cellular senescence in HNSCCs.Using immunohistochemical analysis, we observed a significant up regulation of MUC4 in 79% (68/86) of HNSCC tissue samples compared to only 10% (1/10) of benign tissues. Further, we observed high expression of MUC4 in a majority of HNSCC cell lines tested. Knockdown (KD) of MUC4 with specific shRNA in HNSCC cells markedly decreased cell proliferation. The doubling time increased from 26 h to 36 h and 34 h to 42 h in MUC4 silenced UMSCC-1 and SCC-10B cells, respectively as compared to their control counterparts. MUC4 KD in UMSCC-1 and UMSCC-10B cells resulted in accumulation of cells at the G0/G1 phase with concomitant decrease in the expression of cell cycle regulating proteins like Cyclin-E and Cyclin-D1, and decrease in BrDU incorporation. More importantly, MUC4 KD resulted in the induction of cellular senescence in both cell lines as indicated by an increase in the number of flat, enlarged and senescence-associated -galactosidase (SA--Gal) positive cells. Further,MUC4 KD resulted in the inhibition of FAK signaling, and decreased motility and invasive behavior in both UMSCC-1 and UMSCC-10B cells. Mechanistic dissection of senescent response to MUC4 silencing indicated decreased acetylated histone enrichment at Cyclin-E/Cyclin-D1 promoters, leading to their downregulation. Further, both cell lines UMSCC-1 and UMSCC-10B underwent a P16 and P21 dependent cellular senescence in response to MUC4 KD that requires inactivation of Akt and ERK signaling. In conclusions, these findings suggest a novel role of MUC4 in regulating cellular senescence and provide evidence of the functional role of MUC4 in the proliferation, motility and invasion of HNSCC cells. Therefore, downregulation of MUC4 may be a promising therapeutic approach for Head and Neck cancer treatment.']",

A single founder mutation, p.Arg112dup, accounts for the majority of CDKN2A mutations in Swedish carriers. This mutation alters the peptide sequences of tumor suppressors p16-INK4A and p14-ARF. The aim of this study was to assess cancer risks in CDKN2A p.Arg112dup carriers and their first (FDRs) and second degree relatives (SDRS).  Methods', '  In this prospective cohort study, cancer diagnoses in CDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers (n=120), non-carriers (n=111), carriers FDRs (n=275) and SDRs (n=321) and controls (n=3976) were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Relative risks (RR) for cancers were calculated (number of cancers/person years). Due to the finding of high risks in mutation carriers of cancers that are normally associated with tobacco smoking, data was retrospectively collected on smoking history in carriers.  Odds ratios were calculated to compare smoking (ever-smoker/never-smoker) in carriers with or without a diagnosis of non-melanoma cancer. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for all RRs.  Results', '  In carriers prospective RR for non-melanoma cancers was 5.0 (95% CI=3.7-7.3), for pancreatic cancer 43.8 (95% CI=13.8-139.0), for cancers in upper digestive tissues 17.1 (95% CI=6.3-46.5), and in respiratory tissues 15.6 (5.4-46.0). In FDRs and SDRs, RRs were significantly elevated for cancers in pancreas, respiratory and upper digestive tissues. In ever-smoking carriers compared with never-smoking carriers, the odds ratio of cancers in pancreas, respiratory or upper digestive tissues was 9.3 (95% CI= 1.9-44.7).   Conclusions', '  CDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers from melanoma-prone families and their FDRs and SDRs have elevated risk for pancreatic, lung, head and neck and gastro-esophageal carcinomas. These cancers were mainly seen in ever-smoking carriers. This is the first study that shows association between smoking history and cancer diagnoses in CDKN2A mutation carriers. Germline CDKN2A mutations may confer an increased sensitivity to carcinogens in tobacco smoke. CDKN2A mutation carriers should be counseled to abstain from smoking.']",

        "Background":"['Disparities in incidence, mortality and survival are present among head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, with males and African Americans disproportionately affected. Etiologic risk factors for HNSCC include tobacco and alcohol use and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Epidemiologically, HPV(+) tumors appreciate a prognostic advantage and have a distinct risk profile compared to HPV(-) HNSCCs. HPV(+) HNSCCs also have a different molecular profile than HPV(-) HNSCCs, specifically a higher somatic mutation rate among HPV(-) tumors and a higher degree of epigenetic modifications among HPV(+) tumors. Although disparities in epigenetic modifications by race have been described for breast, liver and colon cancer, these changes are not well understood among HNSCCs. Here, we described epigenetic modification of candidate genes affecting HNSCC carcinogenesis to understand potential molecular differences in tumor phenotype that may be associated with a distinct racial risk profile in HNSCC patients. We identified formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HNSCC tissue blocks archived by the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium Biospecimen Repository for Caucasian and African American patients. Information on site, sex and age was also available. DNA was extracted from tissue collected from areas of >70% cellularity. Using bisulfite sequencing (pyrosequencing), we quantified methylation levels for a panel of candidate genes that have been previously identified as significant in methylation of HNSCCs', ' CCNA1, CD1A, p16, DCC, GADD45 and NDN. Samples were also tested for HPV status. Using a Mann-Whitney-U test, we compared methylation levels by race, HPV status, sex and age. A total of 24 tissue blocks were retrieved, and we excluded five samples due to inadequate tissue, low DNA concentrations or ambiguous site definitions. The mean age at diagnosis was 56.7  6.5 years and the majority were male (79%). The race distribution was fairly even, with 47.4% African American and 52.6% White. Three HNSCCs were HPV(+), 15 were HPV(-) and one was inconclusive for HPV status. Overall, mean methylation levels were 54.9% for CD1A, 33.9% for CCNA1, 33.5% for DCC, 25.2% for NDN, 6.6% for p16, and 3.4% for GADD45. We noted a significant difference in mean methylation levels of CCNA1 by race (46.8% in African Americans and 19.1% in Whites, p < 0.02). We also found higher methylation levels for CD1A among HPV(+) tumors, 70.7%, compared to HPV(-) tumors, 55.6% (p < 0.04). DCC showed higher methylation levels in males compared to females (38.2% vs. 16.7% respectively; p < 0.04). Our preliminary results suggest that many factors, including race, may be associated with epigenetic modification in HNSCCs, and attention to the somatic profile of HNSCCs may indicate novel avenues for prevention and treatment of this disease.']",

Importantly, obesity has been reported to be associated with the occurrence of larger, more advanced tumors and aggressive cancer pathological features, including lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage, and high grade. Cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs), the most abundant cellular component of breast cancer-associated stroma, promote carcinogenesis through paracrine effects. However, the molecular basis of adipocytes implication in breast carcinogenesis remains elusive. To shed light on this important phenomenon, we established and characterized normal adipocytes from post-plastic surgery of breast tissues. We have shown that these cells express various adipocyte biomarkers, including Leptin, TNF- and FABP4. Furthermore, we investigated the role of the tumor suppressor p16 INK4A protein in adipocytes activation. We have found that specific down-regulation of p16INK4A by shRNA increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines including leptin, activated breast adipocyte and enhanced their migration/invasion abilities. Consequently, media conditioned with these cells stimulated the proliferation and the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells and enhanced endothelial cell differentiation into capillary-like structures. In addition, we have also shown that media conditioned with breast cancer cells decrease the expression of p16INK4A and increase the expression of leptin in adipocytes.These results provide the first indication that p16INK4A down-regulation in breast stromal adipocytes is an important step toward their activation.']",

Further Western blot analysis concluded modulations in Rb-phosphorylation status and apoptotic signaling factors may explain these E2F1-mediated effects. Conclusions', ' While significant differences are evident in the miRNA profiles of HNSCC compared to normal mucosa, a striking degree of similarity exists between HPV-positive and -negative miRNA deregulation.

        "Background":"['We have recently reported on the discovery of a long non-coding RNA imbedded in intron 2 of the p16/ARF (CDKN2A) locus at 9p21. CAI2 is a non-conserved, RNA pol II regulated gene with whose expression is highly correlated with parent genes p16 and ARF. However, CAI2 is expressed in cell lines deleted for p16, ARF and even p15, and is expressed cell lines epigenetically silenced for p16 and/or ARF. Furthermore, treatment of p16 and/or ARF epigenetically silenced cell lines with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidin allows p16 and/or ARF re-expression while having no influence on CAI2, confirming independent regulation. Speculating, therefore, that the regulatory region of CAI2 lies imbedded in the non-transcribed portion of intron 2, we created expression constructs of the immediate 5 region of CAI2. However, consistent with a bioinformatical analysis, no regulatory activity was detected. This suggests that this non-coding RNA is non-traditionally controlled by remote but yet to be identified regulatory element(s) and/or mechanisms. By colony formation assay, CAI2 overexpression can inhibit cell growth in the p16 intact HEK293T and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines. RNA Immunoprecipitation has revealed that CAI2 interacts with H3K27me3, a recruiter of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that modulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and BMI1, a PRC1 complex protein that is a negative regulator of p16. Consistent with this effect, CAI2 can induce p16 expression in HEK293T cells, and this was hypothesized to be the mechanism by which CAI2 inhibits cell growth. However, we now show that CAI2 can also inhibit colony formation in the p16/ARF deleted MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly however, CAI2 overexpression had little to no effect on 2D cultures of HEK293T or MCF7 cells including DNA synthesis, XTT metabolic activity or cell count.As CAI2 is imbedded in the p16/ARF gene, standard siRNAs may inadvertently influence p16 and/or ARF expression due to actions on their pre-mRNAs. Therefore, we created a series of partial CAI2 knockouts using CRISPR technology and compared their growth by colony formation assay. Notably, clones containing a partial knockout of the 5 region of CAI2 proliferated faster than mock transfected clones, consistent with the growth suppressive properties observed with CAI2 overexpression. In 2D cultures, a small increase in DNA synthesis was also observed in the partial deletions. The HEK293T clones containing partial deletions of CAI2 also exhibited small increases in expression of the remaining intact portions of the gene with a concomitant decrease in p16 expression, all consistent with an influence of CAI2 on p16 expression and cell growth; no influence on ARF expression was observed.Taken together, the data demonstrate that CAI2 is capable of influencing p16 expression, but this influence is insufficient to fully account for the ability of CAI2 to regulate growth, and we conclude that CAI2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene in its own right.']",

Unexpectedly, the results showed that ANRIL transcriptional level was positively and significantly correlated with the P16 mRNA level (r = 0.774, P = 0.003), but not correlated with the P15 or P14 mRNA levels (r = 0.09 or 0.30, P = 0.78 or 0.35). These phenomena were confirmed using the public available transcriptome data in the Broad-Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Furthermore, transcription of both ANRIL and P16 mRNA were observed only in cancer cell lines in which the P16 alleles are unmethylated (Caski, SGC7901, BGC823, GES1, Siha and HeLa), but not in these cell lines in which the P16 alleles are fully methylated (Colo205, PC3, MHCC97H, RKO, SW480 and AGS). These suggest the possibility that methylation of the P16 promoter may inactivate transcription of ANRIL as well as P16. To study the possible causality between P16 DNA methylation and transcriptional silence of ANRIL, we employed P16-Dnmt to induce P16-specific DNA methylation in gastric cancer BGC823 cells, and found that transcription levels of both P16 and ANRIL were significantly decreased by the induced P16 DNA methylation (P<0.001 and 0.024, respectively). Besides, transcription level of P14 was also reduced (P = 0.043) while the P14 promoter CpG islands remained to be unmethylated. In contrast, P16 DNA demethylation induced by an artificial P16-specific transcription factor [Zhang et al. Human Gene Therapy 2012, 23', '1071-81] re-activated transcription of both ANRIL and P16 in H1299 cells (P<0.001). The mechanism of inactivation of ANRIL expression by P16 DNA methylation is under investigation. In conclusion, transcription of ANRIL is regulated by P16 DNA methylation.']",

Invasion capacity of all HNSCC cell lines were all blocked by the three drugs but regorafenib did mostly well. However, axitinib had no effect on TW2.6; but nintedanb and regorafenib had moderate response on TW2.6.

        "Background":"['Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide and has not seen an improvement in survival in decades. Current standard-of-care treatments including surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation still lead to high rates of recurrence and loco-regional metastasis contributing to the poor prognosis in these patients. It is well established that HNSCC are highly immune-modulatory tumors and may therefore benefit from immunotherapy treatment regimens. Better methods are therefore needed to match patients with the appropriate immunotherapy. Recently, human papillomavirus (HPV) was implicated in the etiology of a subset of HNSCC arising in younger patients without a history of alcohol and tobacco use. Approximately 30% of HNSCC tumors are HPV+ and despite late stage presentation, often have a better prognosis and response to therapy. This study examines how host immune recognition and response varies between HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC, with the goal of identifying new targets for immunotherapy. The immune profile and HPV infection status of 41 HNSCC patient tumor samples obtained from surgical resection was characterized by qRT-PCR, PCR, and IHC techniques. Tumor samples were analyzed for the expression of 40 genes involved in immune activation and suppression in the tumor microenvironment to generate an immune profile. Gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and compared across HPV+, HPV- and normal tissue groups by ANOVA and post-test pairwise analysis. HPV infectivity of tumor biopsies was determined using HPV consensus primers (MY09/MY11 and GP5+/GP6+) and confirmed with p16 immunohistochemistry. From these studies, eight of 41 (20%) HNSCC biopsies were HPV+ by PCR and IHC analysis. HPV+ tumors demonstrated statistically significant increased expression of genes related to immunosuppression including regulatory T (CD4, FoxP3, CTLA-4, and FasL) and myeloid suppressor cell markers (CD11b and IL-6, an inducer of these suppressor cells), as well as negative-regulators (SOCS1) (p<0.05). These tumors also demonstrated an increase in markers of immune activation and infiltration, including evidence of T cells (CD4, Fas-L), antigen presenting cells (CD80, CD83, CD1c), and inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules (IL-2, IL-12, IFN- , and OX40L) (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in gene expression found between normal tissue and HPV- HNSCC tumors. These studies demonstrate a general pattern of increased immunogenicity and concurrent immunosuppression in patients with HPV+ versus HPV- HNSCC that could potentially be used to inform immunotherapy treatment of HNSCC patients. HPV+ tumors may be more effectively treated with a regimen that employs a combination of immune stimulation and reversal of immune tolerance mechanisms, while HPV- tumors may require greater immune stimulation to activate endogenous anti-tumor immune responses.']",

To understand this phenomenon, we assessed the expression of p53 pathway members, which are most effected by p14ARF. The expression of androgen receptor (AR), a pivotal prostate cancer regulator, which is also affected by p14arf and MDM2 was analyzed as well. The studies used archival prostate tumor tissues obtained from prostatectomies performed at the Veterans Affairs-Northern California Health Care System in Mather California between 1996 and 2002 to better define the relationship between these interrelated networks. A prostate tumor tissue array consisting of 78 tumors of differing stages and grades was constructed to evaluate correlations between multiple parameters. Immunohistochemical studies assessed expression of the proliferation marker Ki67, p53, MDM2, MDM4, p14ARF, and the AR in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of tumor and adjacent cells. p53, MDM4, p14ARF and AR were detected in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of tumor and non-tumor cells, but were predominantly nuclear. MDM2 expression was primarily cytoplasmic in tumor cells. Multivariate analysis of the immunohistochemical markers identified a strong correlation between expression of p14ARF and AR. Studies utilizing the prostate CWR22 xenograft and LNCaP cell line models revealed that castration or androgen deprivation resulted in reduced p14arf levels and that this effect correlated with a precipitous decline in E2F1-3a levels. In a reciprocal analysis, RB ablation enhanced p14ARF transcription, arguing that the E2F/RB pathway mediates AR-dependent p14ARF expression. However, we also identified an AR binding site located 40 KB upstream of the p14ARF gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies showed that in prostate cells this site was bound by AR. ChIP studies also revealed E2F1 and E2F3 were present at the p14ARF promoter.

To better utilize this valuable resource, we performed its first genome-wide characterization by investigating 12 canine HNSCC cases, of which 9 are oral, via high density array comparative genomic hybridization and RNA-seq. The analyses reveal that these canine cancers faithfully recapitulate many key molecular features of human HNSCC. These include similar genomic copy number abnormality landscapes, analogous sequence mutation patterns, and recurrent alteration of known HNSCC genes (e.g., MYC, CDKN2A) and pathways (e.g., cell cycle, mitogenic signaling, TGF signaling). Amplification or overexpression of protein kinase genes, matrix metalloproteinase genes, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes TWIST1 and SNAI are also prominent in these canine tumors.The strong dog-human molecular homology fundamentally justifies the use of our novel dog-human comparison strategy for driver-passenger discrimination for HNSCC. This cross-species comparison will significantly advance beyond the current findings with the massive genomic data of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), as exemplified by our pilot study on human 8q, a recurrently amplified site in human HNSCC.HNSCC represents the sixth leading cancer by incidence in humans; thus developing effective therapeutic interventions is important. While our understanding of the biology of HNSCC has been greatly advanced over past decades, translating these findings into clinical success has been frustratingly slow.

Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF)1A2 as a novel interacting partner of p16INK4a. eEF1A2 is thought to function as an oncogene in cancers. The p16INK4a protein interacted with all but the D2 (250-327 aa) domain of eEF1A2. Computational docking study predicted that D24/D131 residues of p16INK4a interacted with eEF1A2 and it was confirmed by pull-down assay with mutant p16INK4a (D24A/D131E). Ectopic expression of p16INK4a decreased the expression of eEF1A2 and inhibited cancer cell growth. Furthermore, suppression of protein synthesis by expression of p16INK4a ex vivo was verified by luciferase reporter activity. Microinjection of p16INK4a mRNA into the cytoplasm of Xenopus embryos suppressed the luciferase mRNA translation, whereas the combination of p16INK4a and morpholino-eEF1A2 resulted in a further reduction in translational activity.

Interestingly, persistent activation of AKT can cause oncogene-induced senescence. Dominant negative R248W p53 mutation blocks induction of the tumor suppressor p21CIP1 and is found in aggressive brain tumors such as GBM. Telomere maintenance through telomerase enzyme activity is also found in aggressive brain tumors.

GBMs are characterized by alterations in three core signaling pathways', ' 1) RTK-PI3K-Akt, 2) ARF-MDM2-p53, and 3) Ink4a-RB1. In order to objectively evaluate the risk of developing malignant gliomas from exposure to ionizing radiation, we have developed mouse models with brain-specific deletions of Ink4a, Ink4b, Arf, or PTEN in logical combinations representing the progression of primary or secondary GBMs. Specifically, we examined whether complex, unrepairable DNA lesions, such as those induced by charged particles, are more tumorigenic compared to simple breaks that are efficiently repaired, such as those induced by gamma-rays. Using CDKN2A knockout murine astrocytes in which the tumor suppressors Ink4a and Arf have been deleted (abrogating RB1 and p53 pathways, respectively), we have previously shown that Fe ions are highly tumorigenic compared to gamma-rays. Importantly, we find that loss of a third tumor suppressor, Ink4b, is a critical event in tumorigenesis triggered by charged particles. Based on our in vitro results, we are now using transgenic mouse models with brain-specific deletions of these three key tumor suppressors (Ink4a/b, Arf) to evaluate radiation-induced gliomagenesis in vivo. Nestin-Cre; Ink4ab-/-; Arf f/f mice were irradiated with a single dose of 1 Gy Fe ions or 4 Gy gamma-rays. While gamma-induced damage is efficiently repaired by 1 day, unrepaired DNA lesions are evident up to 1 month following Fe irradiation. Most importantly, we find that combined loss of Ink4a/b and Arf cooperate with DNA damage by Fe ions resulting in a high incidence (25%) of malignant gliomas. These highly heterogeneous tumors arise with an average latency of 4.8 months and are classified as high grade (III and IV) glial tumors. Although tumors arising after gamma irradiation are also classified as high grade, they arise with a longer latency (5.6 months) and occur at a lower frequency (15%). To identify key genetic alterations involved in radiation-induced gliomagenesis, tumors are being analyzed by array CGH and microarray platforms. Strikingly, a 20- to 40-fold amplification of the MET proto-oncogene is observed in a high percentage of tumors. As MET is frequently amplified in human GBMs, it is likely that MET activation may be an important event in tumorigenesis triggered by charged particles in these mouse models. We are hopeful that a global and accurate picture of the genetic changes underlying radiation-induced gliomagenesis will emerge from this study. The data obtained will allow for comparison with changes recently identified in human gliomas by large scale genomic analyses and will allow us to understand whether radiation-induced gliomas are fundamentally similar to those occurring spontaneously, both in mouse models and in human patients.']",

Methods', ' The study samples (n = 210) were collected from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded OPSCC tissues obtained from the Surgical Pathology files in the Department of Pathology at Emory University following the regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Expression levels of p16 as a surrogate marker for HPV-associated cancer, -catenin, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses.

The 12-week PFS was 49%, median PFS was 11.9 weeks and median overall survival (OS) was 10.25 months. Grade 3 toxicities included mucositis (17%), fatigue (14%), skin (8%), diarrhea (8%), and 5 pts withdrew from trial secondary to toxicity. High neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin(NGAL) levels at baseline were associated with worse OS (HR 4.59; 95%CI 1.36, 15.46; p=0.014) and at 4 weeks with worse PFS (HR=12.29; 95% CI 1.26, 119.87; p=0.03) and OS (HR=6.21; 95% CI 0.95, 40.62; p=0.057). High carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA-9) levels at 4 weeks were associated with worse OS (HR=1.18; 95% CI 1.001, 1.41; p=0.049), while decreased CA-9 levels at 4 weeks were associated with better PFS (p=0.77).  Conclusions', '  Efficacy for the combination ofEV and ER is reasonable however plasma markers of tumor invasion and hypoxia are associated with worse outcomes, and further biomarker analysis may define subsets of pts with significant therapeutic benefit.

Aurora-A is required for centrosome function and mitotic spindle assembly. Aurora-A phosphosphorylation supports the activity of many proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival, including important EGFR effectors such as AKT and RAS. High expression of Aurora A has been shown in patients with breast, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and gynecological cancers. The Aurora kinases are known to promote tumor formation and progression, which has led investigators to develop multiple inhibitors of Aurora kinases for clinical use. The expression of Aurora-A kinase in head and neck cancers is not well understood. We assessed the overall survival (OS) for a cohort of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) based upon Aurora-A and phospho-Aurora-A kinase expression (reflecting active Aurora-A). We also related this to SCCHN subtype, using p16 expression as a surrogate for human papillomavirus association, because of the recognition that p16 + cancers have far superior prognosis. Methods', ' Tumor tissue from 89 patients with SCCHN operated on at the Fox Chase Cancer Center was analyzed for Aurora-A and phospho-Aurora-A expression. Aurora kinase expression was determined using AQUATM, with the median values used to distinguish over-expressers.

All the tumors carry Ig/Myc-deregulating chromosomal translocations, which are thought to be the initiating event of PCT development. Therefore we focused on finding possible differences in secondary alterations. Although the subsets were poorly distinguished by microarray-based gene expression profiling, there were significant differences in the expression of p21, p19ARF, p53, HUWE1 and pRb as determined by western blotting and qPCR. DTG tumors were characterized by alterations in pathways governing expression of pRb that included increased expression of INK4A and down regulation of pRb itself as well as down regulation of p19ARF.

The rise of immunomodulatory therapies such as CTLA-4 inhibitors and the durable effects seen in many tumor types are exciting. Despite huge success in this area, positive effects are only observed in a percentage of treated subjects, and it is still not clear why this is the case or how to differentiate responder from non-responder a priori. To this end, a great deal of research is being directed towards the development of in-situ immune profile analyses of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in solid tumors that includes investigation of interdistributions of multiple immune cells and other markers important for immunotherapy (e.g., PD-1 and PD-L1). We present a combined method for the simultaneous IHC staining of up to 7 antigens, multispectral imaging (MSI), a per-cell quantitative analysis, cellular phenotyping and multivariate hypothesized interaction distribution (HID) analysis of the spatial interrelations among the cells within sections of standard clinical biopsies to search for patterns correlated with clinical outcome and therapeutic response. Whole sections of FFPE archival head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) biopsies from 130 subjects (96 male, 34 female, median 58 years, median follow up 60 months) were stained simultaneously for CD3, CD8, CD68, FOXP3, PD-1, PD-L1 using tyramide-conjugated fluorophores based on an Opal multiplexed IHC method. Each section was imaged in its entirety at 4x. Using an automated region selection method, approximately 20 multispectral images were acquired from regions of tumor and tumor margin at 20x. Each image was segmented into tumor, stromal and blank compartments. Cellular locations were found using the DAPI staining. The multimarker stain intensities of each cell were used to delineate each cell's phenotype. Patients are stratified based on human papillomavirus (HPV) status (P16 IHC, HPV DNA PCR, HPV DNA ISH). The phenotype, staining intensity pattern and spatial location for each TIL was then used as input into the HID analysis for an exploration of cellular patterns associated with good and poor clinical outcome in HPV positive or negative HNSCC. The complexity of tumor-immune interactions is driving the requirement for highly multiplexed in-situ cellular analyses.

Recent reports have indicated an increase in incidence of SCCOT in the young and in nonsmokers. Among HNSCC, SCCOT appears to be more aggressive with respect to its clinical and biological behavior. Molecular genetic studies on SCCOT are scarce and most studies have been conducted on a small cohort of patients and/or restricted to a single/few molecular marker(s). We have conducted a multipronged molecular genetic study of SCCOT and analyzed the status of known tumorigenesis pathways including TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), microsatellite instability (MSI), CDKN2A, FHIT and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in surgically resected primary tumor samples and correlated with clinocopathological variables. 67% (67/100) of SCCOT samples exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization whereas a greater proportion (87/100; 87%) exhibited elevated EGFR expression, in accordance with existing literature. Interestingly, p53 nuclear stabilization was found to be more common in young (31/39; 79.5%) than in older (35/59; 59.3%) patients (p = 0.0481). As expected, patients with p53 nuclear stabilization exhibited poorer survival. Further, PCR based mutation screening of exons 5-8 of TP53 (encoding the DNA binding domain) revealed mutations in 50% of samples exhibiting nuclear stabilization. HPV infection was observed in 11/82 (13.4%) tumors while the frequencies of MSI (12/86; 14%) and loss of heterozygosity (LoH) in CDKN2A (32.6%) and FHIT (28.4%) loci were significantly higher than previous studies. In addition, LoH at FHIT locus was significantly associated with p53 nuclear stabilization (p=0.047). Analysis of genome-wide DNA copy number alterations (CNA) using array based comparative genomic hybridization revealed unique copy number alterations validated by quantitative PCR.

Results', '   79% of pts receiving treatment were male with a mean age of 54.9 and 71.6 years for the younger and older groups respectively. The older group had significantly more comorbidities (p < 0.001). The majority of older pts presented with oral cavity tumors (46%) while the oropharynx was the predominant site in the younger group (45%). 55% of younger and 49% of older pts presented with stage 4 disease across all sites. A total of 51 pts were p16 positive with no statistical differences between the groups. Surgery was the initial treatment for 57% of older pts (p < 0.008) while 46% of younger pts received concurrent chemotherapy and radiation as the primary treatment (p < 0.008). There was no statistically significant difference in surgical or radiation complications between the groups. Although most pts receiving chemotherapy experienced complications, older pts had slightly more (93% vs. 78%; p<0.031). The mean survival was 24.8 months with no statistical difference between groups.  Significantly more pts in the older group, at last follow-up, were disease free (p < 0.012). Conclusions', '  The treatment of elderly pts with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in our experience was congruent with that of younger pts. Elderly pts did not suffer more complications with surgery or radiation, however chemotherapy produced somewhat more complications in the elderly pts. Elderly pts did display less evidence of disease on follow-up. Age is always a consideration when treating individuals, but should not preclude the curative standard.']",

Median number of lymph nodes recorded on the left and right sides were 24 and 25.  Fewer than 18 nodes was associated with significantly worse OS relative to  18 nodes (hazard ratio 1.38, 95%CI 1.09-1.74, p = 0.007). The model with this cut point had minimum AIC of all possible models. The difference appears to be driven by local-regional failure (HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.02-2.08, p = 0.04) but not distant metastasis (HR 1.08, 95%CI 0.77-1.53, p = 0.65).

Conclusions', '   Identifying 18 or more lymph nodes was associated with improved overall survival and lower rates of local-regional failure.  The benefit is seen in both p16-positive and p16-negative patients.

As a tumor suppressor gene, p16 has biological functions including regulation of cell cycle progression at the G1/S boundary, angiogenesis, cell senescence, tumor invasion, cell spreading, apoptosis and anoikis. The present study was undertaken to assess the role of p16 in regulating tumor radioresponse and the underlying mechanisms in OPC cell lines.OPC cell lines HN-5 (HPV and p16 negative) and UMSCC-47 (HPV and p16 positive) were used. P16 overexpressing HN-5 cells and shRNA p16 knockdown UMSCC-47 cells were generated using lentivirus vectors. Treatment endpoint was clonogenic cell survival (CSA) determined 10-12 days (for HN5) or 17-20 days (for UMSCC-47) after exposing the cells to 2-10 Gy single doses of -radiation (IR). Compared with the control (scramble) cells, p16-overexpressing HN5 cells had significantly higher radiosensitivity (by a factor of 1.56 at 0.1 cell survival fraction); whereas, p16-knockingdown UMSCC-47 cells had less radiosensitivity (by a factor of 1.23 at 0.1 cell survival fraction). Overexpressing P16 in HN-5 cells significantly prolonged the presence of radiation-induced double-strand breaks detected on the basis of 53BP1 foci at 24h after 4 Gy IR. To directly gauge damaged DNA, an alkaline comet assay to detect both single- and double-strand DNA breaks was performed. P16 overexpressing HN-5 cells exhibited a 2.09-fold increase in the comet tail moment 48 hours after IR. This finding was supported by increased expression of 53BP1 analyzed by Western blot.In conclusion, other than being a robust surrogate marker for tumor control and survival outcome, our findings demonstrated that p16 also functions as a potent radiation sensitizer.

However, SET action in gene expression is unknown, so we assessed SET role in the control of epigenetic modifications.Materials and Methods', ' HNSCC (HN6, HN12 and HN13), HEK293 and NOK-SI cell lines were used. SET overexpression was obtained in HEK293 and NOK-SI cells using pcDNA3.1 with SET cDNA, and SET knockdown in HNSCC cells using siRNA or shRNA. Human transcription factors RT Profiler PCR Array profile (TF) and human tumor suppressor genes (TSG) EpiTect DNA Methyl qPCR Array System (SABioscience-Qiagen) were used to determine the SET action in gene transcription and DNA methylation. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), immunofluorescence, Western blotting and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) activities (EpiSeeker DNMT Activity Quantification Kit; Abcam) assays were used. Trichostatin A (TSA, 100 ng/mL), which increases histone acetylation, or 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza, 1ug/mL), which decreases DNA methylation, were used for epigenetic modifications.Results', ' TFs mRNA analysis showed only 15 genes up-regulated and 65 down-regulated in HEK293/SET cells. Eight down-regulated (ATF2, CTNNB1, HIF-1A, NFATC3, RELA and STAT1) and two up-regulated (ATF3 and MYB) genes were also assessed by qPCR and similar mRNA profile was obtained. HNSCC SET knockdown cells presented opposite mRNA profile. ChIP analysis was performed for nine genes and HIF-1A, NFATC3 and STAT1 promoters showed interaction with SET. However, NFATC3 and STAT1 protein levels were not altered. DNA methylation profile of TSG showed that SET overexpression in HEK293 and NOK-SI cells promoted hypomethylation whereas SET knockdown in HN12 and HN13 cells promoted hypermethylation. HN6, HN12 and HN13 control cells, which present constitutive SET accumulation, presented a methylation loss pattern similar to the observed in HEK293 and NOK-SI cells with SET overexpression. GSTP1, PTEN and TP16 mRNAs levels decreased in SET-overexpressing cells despite the DNA demethylation status. To assess which modification is the main SET mechanism in the gene expression regulation, we performed qPCR in cell lines treated with TSA or 5-aza.

To evaluate the mechanisms and find alternative treatments we started establishing a large panel of patient derived xenografts from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas displaying the heterogeneity of this disease, as cell lines and thereof established xenografts have only a limited value for preclinical drug evaluation and biomarker analysis due to clonal selection and cellular dedifferentiation. Using these models we evaluate new treatment options, identify predictive biomarkers and test the sensitivity of experimental drugs and treatment approaches.Methods', ' Specimen from head and neck tumor samples were transplanted subcutaneously to immunodeficient mice within 24 hours. In case of engraftment groups of 5-6 mice were treated after 3rd passage with 5-FU, MTX, Cetuximab, Carboplatin, Docetaxel and Everolimus. Treatment was applied for 3 weeks. Response to treatment was evaluated by comparing growth inhibition of treated tumors in relation to a control group. Patient tumors and xenografts were evaluated for HPV status by immunohistochemical staining of p16INK4A and detection of HPV-16 E6 and E7 viral DNA by PCR. Primary tumor and the derived xenografts are screened for common oncogenic mutations using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon - Cancer Panel and for genetic expression profiles by Affymetrix analysisResults', ' In total, 70 tumor samples were transplanted resulting in 26 stably growing patient derived xenografts and 21 remain presently ongoing. So far only 23 xenotransplanted tumors did not grow. This results in an engraftment rate of >60%. Tumors remained histologically similar through several passages. Engraftment was not related to growth fraction of the primary tumor, ranging from 10 to 90% evaluated by Ki67 staining. In a few cases we were able to establish xenografts from primary tumors and synchronous metastases. These showed high similarity concerning growth rate and drug sensitivity. Response to treatment varied considerably. Significant growth inhibition in relation to the control group was observed in 8 of 11 (72%) treated tumors for Everolimus, in 4/11 (36%) for 5-FU, 3/11 (27%) for MTX, in 3/11 (27%) for Carboplatin, in 3/11 (27%) for Cetuximab and in 6/11 (54%) for Docetaxel.

        "Background":"['Over the last several years it has become apparent that the majority of the genome is transcribed with the number of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes significantly higher than the number of protein-encoding genes. The 9p21 locus harbors a number of tumor suppressor genes including p15, p10, ARF, chARF, p16, p16, p12 and p16-ACT, and the long ncRNAs ANRIL and p15AS. The abundance of regulatory genes in such a short span perhaps accounts for why this region is frequently inactivated in many cancers. We report on the novel lncRNA CAI2, a non-conserved gene imbedded in p16/ARF intron 2 with homology that is limited to the upper primates. CAI2 is a single exon, RNA pol II regulated gene with a poly A signal localized in p16/ARF exon 3, yet independent of the p16/ARF poly A signal. The expression levels of CAI2, p16 and ARF genes are highly correlated, being low in normal tissue but high in most tumor cell lines with an intact 9p21 locus. Notably, high levels of CAI2 expression are associated with advanced-stage of neuroblastoma, one of the few tumor types where 9p21 alterations are infrequent and where p16 is paradoxically overexpressed. CAI2 expression was associated with a poor outcome in neuroblastoma, suggesting value as a biomarker of tumor cell stage and patient outcome. Despite the strong correlation between CAI2 and p16 expression, CAI2 is independently regulated and is expressed in cell lines deleted or epigenetically silenced for p16, ARF and even p15. In response to serum deprivation, CAI2 levels rise rapidly in normal mononuclear cells, but slowly in tumor cell lines, suggesting that CAI2 is also a stress-response gene. CAI2 levels also rise in response to chemotherapeutic insult such as etoposide treatment. The NMB7 neuroblastoma cell line is one of very few neuroblastoma cell lines to express CAI2 at low levels. During passage, this cell line undergoes morphological changes, proliferates faster and exhibits an increase of more than 100-fold in CAI2 expression, though a concomitant decrease in Tyrosine Hydroxylase expression suggests the changes are not due to differentiation. Consistent with this, Retinoic Acid treatment, part of standard neuroblastoma therapeutic regimen known to induce neuroblastoma cell differentiation, slightly decreased CAI2 expression. As many lncRNAs regulate chromatin states, we considered epigenetic roles for CAI2 in gene regulation. RNA Immunoprecipitation revealed that CAI2 interacts with H3K27me3, a recruiter of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that modulates chromatin structure and gene expression. As many advanced stage neuroblastomas and neuroblastoma cell lines highly express p16, we speculate that CAI2 binding to H3K27me3 may modulate chromatin structure and regulate expression at the 9p21 locus.']",

Among oropharynx cases with TP53 wt, p16 testing was performed for confirmation. Next generation Sequencing (NGS Sanger) was used for tumor mutation load (TML) calculation.

Conclusions', ' Despite fewer TML high cases among HPV + patients, there was no difference among PDL1 expression. It is possible that a lower threshold may need to be used when determining TML high vs. low in viral-driven cancers. It is also possible that in view of viral immunogenicity, certain genomic alterations contribute more to higher PDL1 expression rather than the sum of total genomic alterations.

Strikingly, genetic ablation of IL-6 strongly promoted prostate cancer initiation, progression and metastasis in Pten-deficient mice. Mechanistically, IL6/Stat3 signaling regulates p19Arf-p53-induced senescence by modulating expression of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in pre-neoplastic cells.

Recently, our group as well as others found that WHSC1 was overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including lung and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, with low or no expression in normal tissues except the testis. Long-term survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) remains poor and thus new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Epigenetic alterations have mainly been studied as a potential mechanism of progression from dysplasia to squamous cell carcinoma. Given the promising potential of HMTs as novel drug targets and the aforementioned interesting expression patterns, we further investigated the role of WHSC1 in carcinogenesis through immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) using tissue microarrays of 123 locoregionally advanced SCCHN patients, and 6 samples of fibroepithelial hyperplasia lesions obtained from oral biopsies. We classified its expression levels with a scoring scale of 0 (no expression), +1 (mild), +2 (moderate) or +3 (strong). WHSC1 expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm was moderate (score +2, 37%) or strong (score +3, 38%) in 75% of SCCHN samples, while 25% showed mild (score +1, 24%) or no (score 0, 1%) expression. WHSC1 staining of normal epithelial regions revealed an exclusively nuclear expression pattern in the basal and parabasal layers. This is consistent with reports suggesting a physiologic role of the Wnt-pathway, which was recently found to be induced by WHSC1, in the differentiation process of the squamous epithelium. We also performed Western blot analysis of WHSC1 in 8 SCCHN cells lines, 3 control fibroblast cell lines and 1 keratinocyte cell line. We observed moderate to strong overexpression of WHSC1 in 4 of 8 SCCHN cell lines, while no expression was detected in the normal keratinocytes or the fibroblast cell lines.

Analysis of model output provided an approach to identify target genes in SCNA regions and assess the effect of genomic alterations on expression.Results', ' Genome-wide GE, CN, ME, and miR data were available for n = 279 (HNSCC) and n = 159 (LUSC) tumor samples. Univariate modeling detected a strong overall association between GE and CN, as measured by the coefficient of determination (model R2). Although some genes found in SCNA studies produced large model R2 e.g. SOX2 a number of genes with large model R2 are relatively unknown. Notable examples include DVL3, and SENP2, which were implicated as driver genes in the 3q amplicon by a recent study of LUSC but not identified in the TCGA report. Remarkably, the model R2 for DVL3 and SENP2 was also high in HNSCC, and such a finding in a distinct tumor type provides validation and merits additional study. Output from models additionally including ME and miR as covariates contributes insight into the diversity of regulation of gene expression, but the strength of the association between GE and CN could mask other effects. Thus we constructed linear models in which the response variable was the residuals from the GE/CN model and the covariates were ME or miR. The TCGA study of glioblastoma noted frequent methylation of MGMT. When modeling MGMT we detected a highly significant association between ME and the GE/CN residuals in both HNSCC and LUSC. These results illustrate a pronounced effect of ME on GE conditional on CN.Conclusion', ' Linear modeling techniques provide a flexible and powerful basis for performing integrated analysis of genomic data. Our approach produces predicted results when analyzing known cancer genes, highlights lesser known genes for future study, provides insight into gene regulation, and draws attention to genes relevant in multiple tumor types.']",

        "Background":"['The CDKN2A locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes two tumor suppressors', ' the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a and the MDM2 regulator p14ARF. Homozygous deletion of this locus is among the most common genetic events in human cancer across tissues, with the resultant selective advantage to cancer cells generally attributed to the loss of CDKN2A proteins, which help maintain functional Rb and p53. However, in greater than 90% of cancer tissues harboring CDKN2A deletion, the adjacent CDKN2B gene encoding the p15 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, is also deleted. The degree to which CDKN2B-encoded p15 loss contributes to human tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we show that CDKN2B is highly upregulated in common, benign melanocytic nevi (moles) expressing the constitutively active BRAF(V600E) oncogene. A large percentage of melanomas develop in continuity with these pre-existing nevi, suggesting that nevus melanocytes are not permanently senescent, and can serve as tumor-initiating cells upon acquisition of additional genetic changes. By examining primary melanocytes isolated directly from freshly excised benign human nevi, as well as normal primary melanocytes engineered to inducibly express BRAF(V600E), we link BRAF activation to a TGF-dependent p15 induction that arrests nevi in their pre-malignant state. We also use the primary nevus cells to establish a new genetically-defined, human in vivo melanoma xenograft model, which maximizes medical relevance by utilizing the naturally occurring melanoma precursor cells in a native 3-dimensional environment. With this approach, we show that p15 depletion in benign nevi promotes progression to melanoma, establishing the reversibility of nevus melanocyte growth arrest, and the functional importance of CDKN2B loss in human cancer.']",

Although, T-ALL responds to standard therapies, in 20% of cases, treatment fails to induce sustained remission, resulting in reduced patient survival. Inhibition or restoration of the mutant gene products that drive tumorigenesis can reverse the aberrant cell growth and result in elimination of tumor cells through the phenomenon of oncogene addiction. In order to recapitulate tumor regression and recurrence, we have developed conditional mouse models of MYC-dependent T-ALL, thereby allowing for the investigation of therapeutic resistance. Recently, we have shown oncogene addiction in our MYC-driven murine model of T-ALL occurs through both tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms, such as cellular senescence and apoptosis, and tumor cell-extrinsic, host-dependent mechanisms, including inhibition of angiogenesis, immune system-dependent tumor clearance, and autocrine/paracrine survival signaling. We now present evidence that loss of either p53 or p19ARF facilitates tumor recurrence through distinct mechanisms. p53 utilizes host-dependent mechanisms by allowing tumors to maintain angiogenesis, while p19ARF employs tumor-cell intrinsic mechanisms to circumvent senescence upon oncogene inactivation in vivo. To further interrogate the mechanisms that underlie p53- and p19ARF-dependent tumor recurrence, we performed gene expression analysis on MYC wild-type, MYC/p53-/-, and MYC/p19-/- tumors before and after MYC inactivation. Utilizing novel computational techniques to compare gene expression from our T-ALL cells to gene expression of normal hematopoietic differentiation from the Immunologic Genome Project, we have delineated the regulatory pathways underlying the effects of tumor suppressor loss in human MYC-driven lymphoma cells in the presence of targeted MYC-inactivation. We have also utilized expression analysis to establish gene signatures from unique to our MYC/p53-/- and MYC/p19-/- murine T-ALL models and shown them to be prognostic for specific human T-ALL subtypes, as well as patient relapse-free survival. Overall, we have utilized whole transcriptomic analysis to further define the underlying cell signaling by which loss of p53 and p19 facilitate tumor recurrence and demonstrated that loss of these tumor suppressors can predict outcome in human patients.']",

A majority of cell lines were found to be sensitive to PD-991, although there was a distinct population of resistant cell lines. In sensitive melanoma cell lines, treatment with PD-991 resulted in loss of hyperphosphorylated RB and a concomitant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Treated cells displayed an enlarged flattened morphology and an increase in SA--galactosidase staining compared to vehicle controls, indicative of cellular senescence. RB-null cell lines were resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition, and did not display cell cycle arrest or senescence.

Loss of CDKN2A/p16 correlated with sensitivity to PD-991 (p<0.02), and this was confirmed at the level of protein expression.

Our group has developed a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive diagnostic test based on soluble CD44 (solCD44) and total protein levels. We used a case-control design to evaluate soluble markers for HNSCC in 150 oropharyngeal (OP) and lip/oral cavity (Lip/OC) patients and 150 controls frequency matched for age, gender, race, ethnicity, tobacco use and socioeconomic status. We compared patient groups with respect to important covariates using the chi-square, Fisher's exact test, or t-test. Markers mean levels were compared either by t-test or ANOVA, followed by pairwise multiple comparisons. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate predictivity of the salivary markers univariately and multivariately with adjustment for demographics and risk factors. We report odds ratio (OR) estimates with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and area under the curve (AUC) of the operating characteristic curve (ROC) for fitted models. The case-control groups did not differ in regards to age, gender, race, ethnicity, history of ever vs. never smoking, current alcohol use, number of teeth removed, or county vs. private hospital system. The mean log2CD44 and protein levels were elevated in cases (log2 CD44= 1.94 ng/ml, protein=0.93 mg/ml) compared to controls (log2 CD44= 1.28 ng/ml, protein= 0.76 mg/ml), (p<.0001; p=.003, respectively).

There were no significant mean log2 CD44 level differences between Lip/OC and OP cases, TNM or HPV status in cancer patients. In the cases for which HPV status was available (as measured by the surrogate marker p16), log 2 CD44 levels varied by smoking status (lower in never smokers), by drinking status in HPV + cases (lower in non-drinkers) and N-stage (higher levels in N0, Nx vs. N1-N3 in HPV-positive and the opposite effect in HPV-negative tumors). For protein, there were no differences in either the case or the control group based on demographic or risk variables. When we stratified by HPV status, race/ethnicity and drinking status did have an effect (higher levels in blacks vs. WNH and higher in current vs. former and never/mild drinkers in HPV positive tumors only). A specific model was developed for each of the 3 race/ethnicity groups with the highest AUC for blacks (AUC= .835) and WNH (AUC= .831) followed by HW (AUC= .777).

Of the 71 detected aberrations, 17 (24%) have been implicated in impaired cell cycle regulation and arrest; specifically in genes which encode the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK12 Q570*, CDKN2A/B loss, CDKN2A p16INK4a loss and p14ARF exon 2-3 loss) or their associated proteins including amplification of CCND1 and CCNE1 (n = 3). Of these 8 patients with impaired cell cycle regulation, 5 (63%) demonstrated concurrent mutations associated with epigenetic deregulation and impaired DNA methylation, most commonly ARID1A Y1211fs*5 and S1929fs*25, which encodes the AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A, Arid1a, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex); other mutations observed are CREBBP S893L (encoding a ubiquitously expressed transcriptional coregulatory protein controlling chromatin remodeling via its histone acetyltransferase activity); MLL2 R4904* (encoding an H3K4-specific histone methyltransferase) and KDM6A S466* (encoding the histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase UTX). Overall 5 of 19 (26%) patients with advanced relapsed CUP demonstrated a profile of aberrations that concurrently impact cell cycle arrest and epigenetic regulation.Conclusion', ' Through NGS-based molecular profiling, we can a subset of patients with advanced carcinoma of unknown primary with coexisting mutations leading to impaired cell cycle arrest and epigenetic deregulation, highlighting a therapeutic combination with a cell cycle inhibitor (such as Cdk4/6 inhibitors currently in clinical trial) and histone deacetylase inhibitors.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Retrospective analyses of NSCLC from unselected pts provide limited data regarding the role of p16 and incidence of HPV, but suggest that p16 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis.  Our goal is to estimate the proportion of never/light smoking (< 10 pack years) pts with NSCLC with p16+ tumors and correlate these data with outcomes.  We hypothesize that p16+ tumors will be HPV related.  Methods', \"  A tissue microarray was constructed with NSCLC surgical specimens from never/light smokers (1995-2009) available in the Fox Chase Cancer Center Biosample Repository.  Slides were incubated with anti-p16 antibody (E6H4, MTM Laboratories) and wide-spectrum screening rabbit cytokeratin antibody (Dako Z0622).  DAPI was used to define tissue nuclei.  p16 levels were measured with fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) on the HistoRx PM-2000 platform (AQUA).  After image validation, scores from two nonoverlapping images were obtained per case.  p16 AQUA score was analyzed as a dichotomous variable (positive/negative) based on a naturally occurring cutpoint.

        "Background":"['In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the genes CDKN2A (p16 and p14) and MTAP are homozygously co-deleted, with a frequency of 35 %. MTAP cleaves the natural substrate, 5-deoxy-5-methylthioadenosine, to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate, which are converted to adenine nucleotides and methionine. Cells lacking MTAP are unable to salvage adenine through this pathway and rely on the de novo pathway for purine synthesis. This variation between normal MTAP+ cells and tumor MTAP-/- cells led to several studies showing that MTAP -/- cells are more sensitive to inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis.Pralatrexate (PDX) is a second generation antifolate that targets dihydrofolate reductase and via conversion to polyglutamylates, inhibits de novo purine synthesis. 6-Thioguanine (6TG), an antimetabolite analog of guanine, also target de novo purine synthesis. MTAP-deficient ALL cells should be more sensitive to these agents, remarkably so in combination. We tested single agent PDX and 6TG as well as a combination treatment in MTAP+ (Molt4) and MTAP-/- (CEM) ALL xenografts. CEM xenografts were more sensitive to PDX treatment than MOLT4 xenografts. CEM xenografts were also much more sensitive to 6TG, while Molt4 xenografts were resistant to 6TG.

        "Background":"['Oral cancer is the major form of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, which is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Tobacco smoking is one of the leading causes of oral cancer. Dibenzo[a, l]pyrene (DB[a, l]P) is the most potent carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon found in tobacco smoke. Recently we developed a novel mouse model of oral cancer induced by DB[a, l]P; we also showed the remarkable carcinogenicity and specificity of the fjord region diol epoxide metabolite, ()-anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a, l]pyrene (DB[a, l]PDE). Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we have shown over-expression of p53 protein in mice oral squamous cell carcinoma and dysplastic tissues induced by DB[a, l]P and DB[a, l]PDE. Current understanding of molecular pathogenesis of oral cancer in humans suggests that both genetic and epigenetic alterations are crucial and complement each other. Our hypothesis is that both genetic and epigenetic alterations induced by DB[a, l]P can contribute to the development of oral cancer. P53 protein overexpression detected by IHC may result from p53 gene mutation or exposure to genotoxic stress. To determine whether p53 over-expression is in part due to p53 mutations, Exons 5 to 8 of p53 from 5 tumor tissues were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphisms (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. G to T transversion was detected in Exon 5, leading to mutation of codon 155 Arg to Leu; A to T transversion was detected in Exon 7, resulting in mutation of codon 232 Lys to stop codon. To test the epigenetic effect of DB[a, l]P, methylation specific PCR and bisulfate sequencing were used to detect methylation alteration of p16 and RAR- promoters. Promoter hypermethylation of both p16 and RAR- were detected in tumors induced by DB[a, l]PDE; also in oral tissues of mice treated with DB[a, l]P (24nmol, 3 times per week, for 5 weeks, sacrificed at 48 h, 1, 2 and 4 weeks after last dose). These results suggested that genotoxic DNA adducts derived from DB[a, l]P can induce mutations in critical genes, such as tumor suppressor gene p53; this environmental carcinogen also can induce p16 and RAR- promoter hypermethylation at early stage, which can contribute to the promotion and progression of oral carcinogenesis.']",

        "Background":"['Obesity, a disease linked to increased number of adipocytes in various tissues, is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for the development of breast cancer. However, the molecular basis of adipocyte-related breast carcinogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we established and characterized normal stromal adipocytes from post-plastic surgery of breast tissues from obese and lean women. We have shown that adipocytes from obese women express low level of the tumor suppressor p16 protein, have higher secretion of various adipokines and higher invasion and migration capabilities as compared to adipocytes from lean women. In addition, down-regulation of p16INK4A by shRNA in adipocytes from lean women increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines including leptin, activated breast adipocytes and enhanced their migration/invasion abilities. Consequently, media conditioned with p16-deficient adipocytes or adipocytes from obese women promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition in normal breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent manner and induced tumor growth in vivo. Indeed, p16INK4A suppresses Leptin at the mRNA level through miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, which inhibits Leptin expression through a specific sequence at the Leptin 3’UTR. These results show the existence of active adipocytes in the mammary gland of obese women in absence of breast cancer cells and provide the first indication that p16INK4A through targeting miR-141 and miR-146b-5p suppresses Leptin and its procarcinogenic effects. This indicates that p16 pathway has non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressor function in breast stromal adipocytes.']",
