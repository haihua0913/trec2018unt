A Phase 1 dose-escalation trial evaluating PF as an oral single agent was conducted to investigate safety, PK and PD in patients (pts) with advanced cancer (excluding leukemias). Methods', ' PF was administered under fasting conditions QD or BID on a continuous schedule to pts in successive dose-escalating cohorts at doses ranging from 50 mg QD to 300 mg BID. Pts with advanced cancer were enrolled in the study. Results', ' Thirty-seven pts were enrolled into the dose escalation part of the study. Tumor types included colorectal, pancreatic, sarcoma, ALCL and NSCLC. The MTD was 250 mg BID. Three DLTs were observed', ' grade 3 increase in ALT (1 pt at 200 mg QD) and grade 3 fatigue (2 pts at 300 mg BID). The most common AEs were nausea, emesis, fatigue and diarrhea. Nausea and emesis were independent of dose or duration of treatment. Mean AUC (30-57% CV) and Cmax (36-69% CV) increased proportionally with dose from 100 mg QD to 300 mg BID. The median terminal half-life was 46 hours. A 2- to 4-fold increase in the oral midazolam (MDZ) AUC was observed following 28-days of PF dosing at 100 mg QD (n = 3) and 300 mg BID (n = 2), respectively, suggesting PF to be an inhibitor of CYP3A. Ten pts have entered an enriched RP2D cohort of pts with tumors harboring c-Met amplification/gene mutation or ALK fusion genes. There has been 1 confirmed PR in a sarcoma pt with ALK rearrangement (inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor). Among 10 NSCLC pts whose tumors harbor EML4-ALK rearrangement, 1 pt has had a PR, 2 pts have achieved unconfirmed PR and 4 pts have had SD (3 have experienced reduction in tumor burden by ~20% in measurable lesions and 1 has been treated for 28 weeks). Conclusions', ' The MTD of PF is 250 mg BID. The major AEs were fatigue or GI-related, and all AEs were manageable and reversible. There was no evidence of non-linear PK at PF doses >100 QD. Treatment with PF-02341066 resulted in promising clinical activity against tumors carrying activating ALK gene rearrangements. Further study of PF in pts with ALK-dependent tumors is warranted.']",

        "Background":"['Drug resistance is one of important factors limiting effect of most cancer therapies. Understanding mechanisms causing resistance can facilitate overcoming resistance. c-MET gene activation, via either activating mutations or gene amplification, is an oncogenic driver for some non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) in patients as well as in patient derived xenograft (PDX) (1). c-MET gene activation is also one of the two most dominant TKI-resistance seen among the patients treated with EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) (1, 2). Therefore, c-MET inhibitor could become an important treatment option for NSCLC patients whose c-MET is either de nova activated or activated during TKI treatment (1). We recently demonstrated that Crizotinib (PF2341066), an approved drug against NSCLC with ALK-fusion and a known c-MET inhibitor, can effectively treat NSCLC with c-MET gene amplification, including those resistant to EGFR-TKIs (1), in PDXs. Specifically, we described two models LU1901 and LU2503  both with amplified gene, accompanied with over-expression, of c-MET, and both sensitive to Crizotinib (complete regression in LU2503, while near-complete regression in LU1901) (1), confirming the c-MET activation as dominant oncogenic driver for these two tumors.In the present study, interestingly, the treated LU1901 tumors subsequently re-emerge and re-grow even in the presence of continuous treatment. In particular, the re-growed LU1901 become completely resistant to Crizotinib (we call LU1901R), even after it was re-engrafted. Pharmacodynamic analysis revealed that the LU1901R tumor has similar level of phosphorylation (or activation) of c-MET as the parental LU1901. Crizotinib treatment caused nearly-similar inhibition of c-MET in both LU1901 and LU1901R, as well as the downstream signaling, including pMEK and pAKT by Crizotinib in both LU1901 and LU1901R tumors along with c-MET inhibition. All these suggest that the threshold of c-MET activation for prompting tumor growth/survival is significantly lower in LU1901R than LU1901. We are currently characterizing the LU1901R in order to identify the mechanisms of resistance, and attempt to find approach to overcome them.In summary, we have successfully developed c-MET inhibitor resistant models that may reflect resistance emergence in the clinics. These models could be particularly useful in investigating clinical resistant mechanisms and evaluating new therapy that can overcome resistance.']",

It is widely expressed and associated with poor prognosis in breast, lung, liver, kidney and brain cancers. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the only known ligand of c-Met, also found in many tumors and cancers where activity is driven by the c-Met receptor. c-Met is accepted as an attractive anti-cancer target, but the development of cancer therapy targeting c-Met receptor or kinase remain very challenging. Clinical development of c-Met/HGF targeting antibodies has shown initial evidence of clinical efficacy but failed in phase III. Small molecule inhibitors often suffer from selectivity issues. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) which combine an antibody with highly potent cytotoxic agents, becomes an attractive approach against c-Met overexpressing cancers such NSCLC. We have identified an anti-c-Met antibody STI-0602 and generated ADCs from a panel of cytotoxic agents such as microtubulin inhibitor and DNA damaging agents. ADCs retained the binding to c-Met receptor and showed potent cell killing in a variety of c-Met-positive cell lines. ADCs also showed in vivo efficacy in a panel of c-Met-positive human NSCLC xenograft models like A549, H292, EBC-1, HCC827 and H1993, which suggest a potential therapy for c-Met overexpressing lung cancer and other cancers.']",

Methods', ' We retrospectively analyzed 1199 consecutive NSCLC patients, who were tested for C-MET expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) between Nov 2013 and Sep 2015. The staining intensity within tumor tissue was graded on a scale of 0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate), and 3+ (strong). C-MET positivity was defined as C-MET expression with strong staining intensity (grade 3+) in more than 50% of tumor cells. Among 262 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation, 83 EGFR-mutant patients received EGFR-TKI as a first line therapy. Results', ' In total of 1199 tumors, the frequency of each tumor with C-MET grade 0 to grade 3+ was 10.8%, 41.0%, 32.5%, and 15.7%, respectively. C-MET expression was significantly stronger in the tumors with adenocarcinoma than those with squamous cell carcinoma (P< 0.001). In the tumors with adenocarcinoma, EGFR-mutant tumors showed stronger expression of C-MET than EGFR-wild type tumors (P< 0.001) but no difference in C-MET expression by mutation types was observed (P= 0.248). In the first-line EGFR-TKI treatment group, there was no significant difference in response rate to EGFR-TKI between the patients with C-MET positivity (n = 7) and those with C-MET negativity (n = 76) (71% vs. 88%, P= 0.231). However, the median progression-free survival (PFS) to EGFR-TKI was significantly shorter in the C-MET positive group compared with the C-MET negative group (4.3 months vs. 11.9 months, P= 0.015). Conclusions', ' C-MET overexpression was associated with shorter PFS to EGFR-TKI in the patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

        "Background":"['Tumor invasiveness and therapeutic resistance strongly contribute to the low (<10%) five-year survival rate for advanced stage lung cancer; thus, identification of novel interventions targeting metastasis and therapeutic resistance is a necessity. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) are two cell surface receptors known to be associated with lung cancer invasiveness and cell survival. Our lab recently demonstrated that Fn14 was over-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlated with activated epidermal growth factor receptor, and that expression of Fn14 modulated NSCLC cell invasiveness and metastasis. We hypothesize that elevated Fn14 expression can be maintained by c-Met activation, and that blockade of Fn14 can suppress NSCLC invasiveness driven by c-Met. Here we demonstrate that Fn14 protein expression significantly correlated with c-Met expression in primary NSCLC patient tumors. Fn14 and c-Met were more highly expressed in metastatic tumors compared to patient-matched primary NSCLC tumors, suggesting a role in the metastatic phenotype. To further elucidate the relationship between Fn14 and c-Met in NSCLC invasiveness, we employed two cell lines derived from a primary tumor (H2073) and metastatic lymph node (H1993) of the same patient. H1993 cells (c-Met receptor amplification) expressed significantly elevated protein levels of Fn14 compared to H2073 (low c-Met), which were significantly diminished in H1993 cells upon c-Met inhibition through SU11274 treatment. Moreover, exposure of H2073 cells to HGF induced the protein expression of Fn14. The elevated expression of Fn14 through HGF stimulation (H2073) or c-Met receptor amplification (H1993) was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with U0126, a potent MEK inhibitor, suggesting that c-Met-induced Fn14 expression may depend on MAPK signaling. To further elucidate the effect of Fn14 on global c-Met-induced expression, genome-wide expression analysis was employed to determine genes both over-expressed in H1993 compared to H2073 and subsequently suppressed in Fn14 depleted H1993 cells. RALGPS2, a gene over-expressed in lung tumors that induces of c-fos and OPRL1, a gene elevated in metastatic melanoma, were elevated in the metastatic cell line and subsequently suppressed with Fn14 depletion. In addition, shRNA-mediated depletion of Fn14 in H1993 cells attenuated cell migration and invasion by 45% and 40%, respectively. This work demonstrates that c-Met and Fn14 may play a critical role in NSCLC metastasis, and suggests that targeting Fn14 may impact c-Met-driven NSCLC invasiveness. Successful targeting of NSCLC invasiveness would have significant clinical impact on a disease that is deadly in its advanced stages.']",

        "Background":"['Current EGFR/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) combination therapies are shown to be susceptible to acquired resistance in the majority of NSCLC patients. To understand how cells develop EGFR/c-Met TKI resistance, we use three model NSCLC cell lines', ' H2170, H358 and H1975. H2170 and H358 cell lines express high levels of EGFR and c-Met and are EGFR wild-type. These cell lines were made resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib, the c-Met TKI SU11274 and a combination of both by exposure to increasing concentrations of these TKIs. The H1975 cell line is positive for two EGFR TKD mutations (T790M and L858R) which confer resistance to erlotinib.Studies have shown that EGFR/c-Met TKI resistant cells may use alternative signaling pathways to activate downstream transcription/translation proteins previously activated by EGFR and c-Met signaling. The Wnt/-catenin and mTOR pathways are demonstrated to have significant roles in cell survival, resistance and tumorigenesis in NSCLC. Several EGFR/c-Met-linked proteins in these two signaling pathways were differentially modulated in H2170 and H358 resistant lines. The Wnt signaling transducer -catenin plays a role in cellular proliferation and death and its deregulation is implicated in lung cancer. Protein kinase GSK-3 also plays an important role in lung cancer and its inhibition by Wnt results in mTOR activation. It is encoded by two genes, GSK-3 and GSK-3. GATA-6 is a transcriptional activator of Wnt and is also implicated in several cancers. Active -catenin was found to be 2 to 4-fold upreglated in H2170 SU11274-resistant (SR) cells and 2 to 20-fold upreglated in H2170 erlotinib-resistant (ER) cells, in the presence and absence of TKIs and growth factor ligands, when compared to nave H2170 cells. GATA-6 was found to be 1.5 to 4-fold upreglated in H2170 SR cells and 2 to 3-fold upreglated in H2170 ER cells. Conversely, p-GSK-3 and p-GSK-3 were found to be 1.2 to 4.8-fold and 1.5 to 10.7-fold downreglated in H2170 SR cells, respectively. These results indicate increased activation of the Wnt/-catenin and mTOR pathways in TKI resistant cells.We are currently studying the expression of these proteins further in the H1975 cell line.To translate our studies to patients, we are investigating the role of EGFR/c-Met synergism in NSCLC by conducting a retrospective biomarker analysis using IHC on 100 tissue samples from patients with stage 3 and 4 squamous cell and adenocarcinoma. Preliminary results indicate that EGFR and c-Met receptors are co-expressed in lung cancer tissues and we are acquiring data to determine how co-localization and synergism affects patient prognosis. Further studies are being conducted on proteins in the Wnt and mTOR signaling pathways, such as p70S6Kinase, mTOR, -Catenin and Axin-2, and their involvement in patient prognosis and resistance.

In this study, c-MET gene copy number (GCN) was initially assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the small subgroup of patients with increased c-MET GCN, treatment with tivantinib plus erlotinib was associated with a trend toward improved progression-free and overall survival, and there was no worsening of outcome in patients with low c-MET GCN (Sequist LV, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2011). Methods', ' To further explore study outcomes based on c-MET biomarkers, available archival tissue was tested centrally for c-MET protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the Ventana CONFIRM anti-total c-MET (SP44) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Ventana Medical Systems). Fifty of 167 patients had evaluable tumor samples for IHC evaluation. Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0, 1+, 2+, 3+.

Among 33 patients with nonsquamous tumors, 25 (75%) were c-MET+, whereas only 2 of 17 (12%) squamous tumors were c-MET+, which is consistent with the existing literature (Ma PC, et al. Cancer Res. 2005). Among patients with nonsquamous histology who had c-MET+ tumors by IHC (n=25), treatment with tivantinib plus erlotinib was associated with improved progression-free survival (HR = 0.58; P = 0.28) and overall survival (HR = 0.46; P = 0.21) compared with erlotinib plus placebo. Importantly, there was no detrimental outcome in patients with c-MET-negative nonsquamous tumors (n = 8) for progression-free survival (HR = 0.36; P = 0.29) or overall survival (HR = 0.58; P = 0.55).

There were no statistically significant findings in this IHC analysis, but no apparent signal of harm was observed in patients with c-MET-negative nonsquamous NSCLC. This exploratory IHC analysis also confirmed that nonsquamous NSCLC tumors are more often positive for c-MET expression than squamous tumors. Two ongoing, randomized, phase 3 trials (MARQUEE and ATTENTION) are enrolling only nonsquamous NSCLC patients, which should enrich the population de facto with c-MET+ patients.']",

        "Background":"['ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and c-MET are molecular drivers for a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Approximately 4-7% of NSCLCs carry the EML4-ALK chromosomal rearrangement. We identified overexpression of EGFR and c-MET in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cell lines H3122 and H2228. ALK, EGFR, and c-MET may function cooperatively to modulate tumor growth, stress response, and survival in EML4-ALK-positive cells and co-inhibition may favorably impact tumor control. We therefore investigated the effects of co-inhibition of ALK and EGFR or c-MET on cell survival and response to radiation in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cells.Compared with ALK-negative cell lines (H226, A549 and H520), the ALK-positive cell lines (H3122, H2228) were highly sensitive to the ALK inhibitors crizotinb, ceritinib and alectinib, although with differing sensitivity to radiation. Crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib sensitized H3122 and H2228 to radiation, as evaluated by clonogenic assay. However, knockdown of ALK by siRNA in H3122 and H2228, or overexpression of EML4-ALK in NIH-3T3 cells, had only moderate effects on radiosensitivity. Simultaneous knockdown of ALK and MET, or ALK and EGFR, increased radiosensitivity as assessed by clonogenic survival in H3122 and H2228 cells, while also increasing inhibitory effects on cell growth and proliferation. These results were confirmed in cells treated with the combination of ceritinib and su11274 (c-MET inhibitor) or with ceritinib and erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor). We further assessed the impact of drug alone or in combination with radiation on cell cycle, cell survival and DNA damage repair pathways. To further evaluate ALK function in the cellular response to radiation in NSCLC, we are developing EML4-ALK stable expression cell lines. Evaluation of drug-radiation interactions in xenograft model systems are also under consideration.These data indicate that co-inhibition of ALK and EGFR or c-MET can enhance growth inhibitory effects in ALK-positive cells and augment radiosensitivity in-vitro, suggesting the potential value for ALK inhibitors combined with EGFR/c-MET-targeting for therapeutic benefit in ALK-positive NSCLC patients with or without radiation.']",

        "Background":"['In clinical practice, acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) causes EGFR TKI treatment failure. Several resistance mechanisms have been identified; EGFR T790M mutation and aberrant activation of c-Met through c-Met gene amplification and/or HGF upregulation are the two most common mechanisms. We have previously shown that combining the highly selective c-Met inhibitor tepotinib with 1st or 2nd-generation EGFR TKIs overcomes gefitinib resistance caused only by c-MET amplification. Third-generation EGFR TKIs such as rociletinib have been developed specifically to overcome T790M-mediated resistance to EGFR TKIs. We hypothesized that combining a 3rd-generation EGFR TKI with tepotinib could overcome resistance to a 1st or 2nd-generation EGFR TKI (e.g. gefitinib) regardless of the mechanism of resistance.We assessed the efficacy of tepotinib and a Merck-synthesized version of rociletinib (MSR) as monotherapy or in combination in a NSCLC cell line xenograft model (HCC827-GR-T790M) with an EGFR del 19 mutation, c-Met amplification, and exogenous T790M expression, and in a patient-derived xenograft model (DFCI081) with an EGFR del 19 mutation and c-Met amplification, but not a T790M mutation.Single-agent tepotinib, erlotinib, and afatinib did not show antitumor activity in HCC827-GR-T790M xenografts and tumors progressed on treatment (median tumor volume [TV] changes >73%). The combinations of tepotinib + erlotinib and tepotinib + afatinib delayed tumor regrowth more than single-agent therapy, but were no more effective than single-agent MSR. In contrast, the combination of tepotinib + MSR had strong antitumor activity in this model with double resistance due to c-Met amplification and exogenous T790M expression, resulting in complete tumor regression (median TV change -97%).In the patient-derived xenograft model DFCI081, tumors progressed under single-agent therapy with the EGFR TKIs erlotinib, afatinib, and MSR, as expected given that this cell line expresses c-Met. In contrast, tepotinib induced complete tumor regression as monotherapy and when combined with each of the EGFR TKIs (median TV change -100%). Complete regression was maintained until the end of the 60-day observation period after treatment termination.These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that combining tepotinib with a 3rd-generation EGFR TKI to overcome double resistance to 1st and 2nd-generation TKIs mediated by T790M and c-Met in NSCLC is more effective than using either agent alone. Furthermore, whereas EGFR TKIs were not effective in tumor models showing c-Met amplification and EGFR del 19 mutation but not T790M mutation, ie resistance is c-Met mediated, tepotinib monotherapy induced complete tumor regression.']",

The expression level of miR-34a was significantly lower in the patients with squamous cell histology (P < 0.001) and lymphatic invasion (P = 0.001).

        "Background":"['c-Met and EGFR are therapeutic targets in NSCLC with a direct role in tumor progression. Highly specific TKIs against c-Met, have limited efficacy individually, and resistance to c-Met TKIs could be due to activation/mutations in EGFR, or c-Met amplification/mutations which could lead to increased expression and constitutive phosphorylation of c-Met. In recent clinical trials, simultaneous treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against c-Met/EGFR has improved patient prognosis, however, their efficacy has been limited due to the development of resistance to TKIs. To establish the mechanism of TKI resistance in NSCLC, two cell lines (H2170 and H358) were made resistant to c-Met and EGFR TKIs (15-30 fold increase in IC50 of SU11274 and 8-10 fold increase in IC50 of Erlotinib) by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of both drugs simultaneously. In H2170 cell lines, a 4-fold downregulation p-cMet 1003 (c-cbl binding site) and a 5-fold increase in p-c-Met 1234/1235 (autophosphorylation site) was observed. Additionally, several proteins in signaling pathways (mTOR and Wnt) linked to EGFR and c-Met, were also found to be differentially modulated in H2170 and H358 resistant lines', ' active -catenin (1.5-2.5 fold increase), p-mTOR (2-4 fold increase), and phospho-pS6kinase (2-20 fold increase). Interestingly, few differences were observed in p-ERK or p-AKT, which are EGFR/c-Met downstream signaling proteins, indicating that other pathways such as mTOR and Wnt may cause TKI resistance. To confirm the role of mTOR and Wnt pathways in resistance and to break their resistance, parental and resistant cell lines were treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the Wnt inhibitor XAV 939 in addition to c-Met and EGFR TKIs. An MTT viability assay showed resistant cell lines to be 2-4 fold more susceptible in comparison to parental cells with the addition of everolimus to TKI combination treatment. In response to the Wnt inhibitor XAV 939, parental cell lines showed no significant increase in sensitivity while resistant lines showed a 2.5-3 fold decrease in viability when compared to c-Met and EGFR TKI combination treatment. Our results suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to c-Met TKI which are mediated by increased c-Met stability, resulting in increases in Wnt expression/mTOR activation. The decreased phosphorylation of c-Met 1003 may lead to decreased binding/activity of Cbl and/or deficient ubiquitination of c-Met. This may result in increased stabilization of c-Met as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of c-Met 1234/1235 and the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Wnt pathways which has been shown. These studies suggest a new treatment modality since inhibitors of Wnt pathway or agents targeting -catenin have not entered clinical testing. These results suggest that Wnt/ mTOR inhibitors combined with c-Met/EGFR TKIs may be a novel combination therapy for lung cancer.']",

        "Background":"['c-Met amplification and acquisition of a second T790M mutation are key mechanisms accounting for majority of resistant cases to first generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs; i.e., erlotinib). The third generation EGFR-TKIs (e.g., AZD9291), which selectively and irreversibly inhibit EGFR activating and T790M mutants while sparing wild-type EGFR, represent very promising therapeutic options for NSCLC patients who have become resistant to 1st generation EGFR-TKIs due to T790M mutation. However, eventual resistance to the 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs has already been described in the clinic, resulting in disease progression. Therefore, there is a great challenge and urgent need to understand how this resistance occurs and to develop effective strategies to delay or overcome the resistance. We show that c-Met amplification and hyperactivation is an universal mechanism to both 1st and 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs since both erlotinib- and AZD9291-resistant HCC827 cell lines possessed elevated levels of c-Met (due to gene amplification) and p-c-Met and were cross-resistant to AZD9291 or erlotinib. Both chemical and genetic inhibition of c-Met overcame the resistance of these cell lines to AZD9291 including enhancement of apoptosis or G1 cell cycle arrest. Consistently the combination of AZD9291 and c-Met inhibition effectively inhibited the growth of both erlotinib- and AZD9291-resistant HCC827 xenografts in nude mice. Hence, we suggest that inhibition of c-Met is also an effective strategy to overcome resistance of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs with c-Met amplification or hyperactivation to AZD9291, providing the rationale for clinical development of this novel combination strategy.

        "Background":"[\"Lung cancer is projected to be the number one cause of cancer mortality in the United States in 2014. Therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 80-85% of all lung cancer cases. EGFR is a protein that is often targeted by these TKIs and several EGFR-TKIs have been approved for clinical use. However, NSCLC tumors almost inevitably acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs, limiting drug efficacy. Previous studies have suggested that co-localization of c-MET and EGFR may be one possible modality of acquired resistance. Additionally, upregulation of alternative signaling pathways such as Wnt or mTOR have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis and have been described as potential mechanisms of resistance. Thus, this study examined these signaling pathways and the status of EGFR/c-Met co-expression in 42 patients with stage I-IV NSCLC. Tumor tissue from biopsy or resection was obtained with patient consent and IRB approval and was subsequently processed, sectioned, and mounted on microscope slides. Total and active forms of EGFR, c-Met, mTOR, S6K, -Catenin, and Axin2 were detected using a singleplex or multiplexed immunohistochemistry staining procedure, and stains were graded by an independent pathologist using a validated scoring system. 65.9% of patients exhibited co-expression of EGFR and c-Met (n = 27) while 51.2% showed co-activation of the two markers (n = 21). Additionally, we observed EGFR/c-Met co-expression to have a statistically significant positive correlation with mTOR expression with a Spearman's rho of 0.411 (p = 0.033), suggesting EGFR/c-Met co-expression may play a role in tumorigenesis possibly via regulation of the mTOR pathway. This notion is further supported by our finding that expression of pS6K, a downstream mTOR pathway protein, showed a strong positive correlation with EGFR expression with a Spearman's rho of 0.504 (p = 0.001). In contrast, Wnt pathway protein active -Catenin exhibits a negative correlation with EGFR expression while Axin2, a negative regulator of active -Catenin, showed a positive correlation. Our findings indicate an inverse relationship between the two signaling pathways in NSCLC with increasing mTOR activation correlating with Wnt downregulation. Furthermore, EGFR expression may be associated with this relationship. Thus, we conclude that EGFR/c-Met co-expression as well as activation of the mTOR pathway may be involved in enhanced pathogenesis of NSCLC and possibly acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy.\"]",

ABBV-399 is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of the anti-c-Met antibody, ABT-700, and monomethyl auristatin E. Although prior efforts at targeting c-Met overexpression have met with limited clinical success, an ADC directed against c-Met represents a unique strategy to deliver a potent cytotoxin directly to c-Met+ tumor cells. Methods', ' In a 3+3 dose escalation design, ABBV-399 was administered at doses ranging from 0.15 to 3.3 mg/kg once every 21 days to pts with metastatic solid tumors (NCT02099058). The recommended single-agent phase 2 dose (RPTD) of ABBV-399 was then studied in a dose-expansion cohort in pts with c-Met+ (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). c-Met overexpression was assessed by an IHC assay utilizing the SP44 antibody (Ventana). Results', ' As of January 4, 2016, 45 pts received at least 1 dose of ABBV-399. Dose-proportional increases of area under the curve (AUC) for ABBV-399 and total antibody were observed after single dose administration. Half-lives for ABBV-399 and total antibody were approximately 2-4 days. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of febrile neutropenia occurred in 1 pt at 3 mg/kg and 1 pt (with septic shock) at 3.3 mg/kg. The RPTD of 2.7 mg/kg was chosen based primarily on safety and tolerability. There were no toxic deaths. Treatment-related adverse events occurring in 10% of pts (including all dose levels and all grades) were fatigue (20%), nausea (17.8%), neuropathy (13.3%), decreased appetite (13.3%), hypoalbuminemia (11.1%), and vomiting (11%). 3/10 evaluable c-Met+ NSCLC pts had a partial response; the duration of response ranged from 1+ to 5 months. There were no responses among 9 pts with c-Met negative tumors. Conclusions', ' ABBV-399 is well tolerated at the RPTD of 2.7 mg/kg and has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in pts with cMet+ NSCLC. The study will continue to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of ABBV-399 in c-Met+ pts both as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care.

        "Background":"['NSCLC is a common cancer with the highest mortality and few effective treatment options, except for the patients with EGFR (Erlotinib, Iressa) and ALK (Crizotinib) activating mutations. Recent studies indicated that some patients with the activating EGFR mutations but without pre-exposure to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are resistant to TKIs. The proposed mechanisms (1) include', ' T790M gatekeeper mutation preventing accessing the kinase activation site, Kras mutation, pTEN loss (2), or c-met amplification (3) that activates ERBB3 signaling (4). Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models have been suggested to more closely represent patient tumors (5, 6). We established several PDXs, including HuPrime LU858, LU859, LU357, LU387, LU1901 and LU2503, using tumor tissues from individual NSCLC patients. LU858/859 contain the classic activating EGFR mutation, L858R; LU1868 contain L858R/T790M double mutations; LU357/LUF387 contain the common exon 20 insertion (2319-2320 AACCCCCAC); and LU1901/2503 have wild type EGFR. To our surprise, the two models with single L858R mutation, just like the model with double mutations, respond to the erlotinib poorly, as seen in some of clinic cases (1). Since they do not have T790M and Kras mutation, we examined them for c-met status, finding that their c-met gene are significantly amplified with also increased c-met/HGF expression as measured by at mRNA and protein levels (IHC), consistent with those seen in clinic (3). Furthermore, LU357 is sensitive to erlotinib while LU387 is not, corresponding to no c-met amplification in LU357 but significant amplification in LU387. All these suggest that the observed erlotinib resistance in these models could potentially be attributed to c-met signaling activation via c-met/HGF autocrine. To this end, we treated LU858, LU859 and LU2503 (also with c-met amplification) with c-met inhibitor, Crizotinib. Indeed, Crizotinib caused significant tumor response as expected in all these models. In particular, the combination treatment of LU858 and LU859 with erlotinib caused complete tumor regression by overcoming the resistance, suggesting a new potential effective treatment option. The results using PDX models can potentially help to design a prospective human study to demonstrate improved efficacy by the combination treatment via patient stratification to include the nave NSCLC patient subjects with c-met amplification/EGFR mutation. 1.

        "Background":"['It is well recognized that non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients with activating EGFR mutations will develop drug resistance after receiving EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). About 20% of those patients with TKI resistance were identified to harbor Met gene amplification. The aim of this study includes two aspects', ' a) generating an acquired c-Met amplified EGFR-TKI resistant tumor line in preclinical setting, and b) exploring combination effect of c-met inhibitor volitinib and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib on the new tumor line. Volitinib is a novel, highly potent and selective c-Met inhibitor, currently being evaluated in the phase I clinical trial.HCC827(exon 19 del E746-A750), a human NSCLC cell line, was treated with increasing concentrations of EGFR inhibitor for about 6 months and gradually produced the resistance to EGFR-TKIs, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. One of the subclones, HCC827C4R was isolated and was confirmed to carry Met gene amplification in comparison to parent cell line HCC827. It was not sensitive to volitinib treatment in cell survival assay due to dual activation of EGFR and c-Met pathways. The results from signal pathway study demonstrated that in HCC827C4R cells, volitinib or gefitinib alone only inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Met or EGFR, respectively, but had no effect on the activation of downstream molecules such as Akt and ERK which drive tumor cell proliferation and other cell functions. In contrast, combination of volitinib and gefitinib significantly inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, c-Met, Akt and ERK in HCC827C4R, and consequently led to a synergistic effect on inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro. These results were further confirmed in HCC827C4R xenograft model in vivo at clinically relevant doses. Combination of volitinib and gefitinib induced significant tumor regression and displayed synergistic effect compared to treatment by either gefitinib or volitinib alone. Consistent with in vitro results, combination group strongly inhibited the downstream Akt and ERK phosphorylation. In addition, combination treatment was well tolerant and no significant drug-drug exposure interaction was observed. These data indicated that both c-Met and EGFR could contribute to activating downstream signaling pathway and control HCC827C4R cell growth. Blocking either pathway may not be strong enough to stop tumor growth.In conclusion, a cell line with activating EGFR mutation and c-Met gene amplification was generated with resistance to gefitinib and insensitivity to volitinib. The combination treatment with volitinib and an EGFR inhibitor gefitinib was highly effective in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that such combination could provide a safe and effective treatment in clinics for this particular patient population.']",

        "Background":"['The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling pathway is often dysregulated in lung cancer. We previously showed that HGF activation of c-Met in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells led to a significant induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) followed by secretion of PGE2. PGE2 caused secretion of TGF by NSCLC cells, followed by both phosphorylation of EGFR and later, delayed phosphorylation of c-Met that does not require HGF. Secretion of PGE2 also appears to boost c-Met pathway signaling downstream via cross-activation by EGFR, in a reinforcing loop that is independent of HGF. We hypothesized that targeting of both c-Met and COX-2 might lead to enhanced anti-tumor effects by blocking both upstream and downstream pro-tumor events. Maximum effects on cell proliferation, invasion and EMT markers were observed in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with combination celecoxib and crizotinib treatment. We next tested whether targeting c-Met with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib combined with celecoxib to target COX-2 would result in enhanced anti-tumor effects in an animal model with heightened HGF/c-Met pathway signaling in the airways. Mice transgenic for airway expression of human HGF were treated with the tobacco carcinogen, 4-(methylnitroso-amino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, from weeks 1-4. Crizotinib (40mg/kg), celecoxib (50mg/kg), combined crizotinib and celecoxib or placebo control was administered by oral gavage daily from week 3 until week 15, at which time lung tumors were evaluated. A highly significant decrease in the number of lung tumors per animal was observed with crizotinib treatment (mean 3.6, range 2-6), celecoxib treatment (mean 4.3, range 3-6) and combination treatment (mean 1.5, range 0-3) compared to placebo control (mean 9.9, range 6-13; P<0.001, Poisson regression). The number of tumors in the combination treatment group was also significantly lower than either single agent treatment (P<0.001). There was also a significant decrease in mean tumor size with crizotinib (mean 0.20mm2), celecoxib (mean 0.22mm2) and combination (mean 0.15mm2) compared to placebo (mean 0.38mm2, P<0.001, mixed effects modeling). Three biomarkers (COX-2, PGE2, and P-MAPK) were optimally down-modulated by combination treatment, compared to single treatment. Additionally, E-cadherin expression was up-regulated while the E-cadherin repressor, snail, was down-regulated with dual treatment. In a pulmonary environment with heightened HGF/c-Met pathway activity, dual inhibition of the c-Met and COX-2 pathways may enhance anti-tumor effects by targeting reinforcing up- and downstream signaling. Such a combination has potential clinical benefit for lung cancer patients with dysregulated c-Met/COX-2 pathways. Supported by R01 CA79882 and P50 CA090440.']",

        "Background":"['c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has hepatocyte growth factor as its ligand. Evidence from biochemical and human genetic studies indicate that c-Met is one of the most frequently activated tyrosine kinases in human cancer. Dysregulated c-Met signaling can result in the development of tumors highly dependent on c-Met. Furthermore, enhanced c-Met signaling is likely involved in conferring resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. The orally available EMD 1214063 and EMD 1204831 inhibit c-Met activity in a potent and highly selective fashion, and are currently being evaluated in cancer patients. Here we report the activity of these compounds in combination with inhibitors of EGFR and VEGF in various tumor xenograft models. EMD 1214063 was tested alone and in combination with EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib and cetuximab) in xenografts of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells, namely the lung cancer H1975 and the NCI-H441 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The H1975 cell line expresses moderate amounts of c-Met, and EMD 1214063 was inactive as a single agent (treatment group/control group [T/C] 78%; tumor growth delay [TGD] 2 days). Cetuximab was active with a T/C of 13% inducing a TGD of 21 days. The combination of EMD 1214063 and cetuximab was active with a T/C of 1% and a TGD of 42 days. The NCI-H441 cell line is characterized by constitutive c-Met overexpression and is sensitive to c-Met inhibitors in vivo. EMD 1214063 (100 mg/kg) was active inducing a T/C of 20%, while erlotinib alone (30 mg/kg) was not efficacious. However, the combination of EMD 1214063 with erlotinib enhanced tumor growth inhibition, induced partial tumor regression in 2/9 mice, and delayed tumor re-growth. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that cMet pathway activation confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors. We additionally investigated the combination of either EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 with VEGF inhibitors in NSCLC models. In NCI-H441 xenografts, EMD 1204831 produced a modest T/C (66%) at the suboptimal dose of 25 mg/kg/bid, similarly to aflibercept at 40 mg/kg (T/C 55%). In contrast, the combination of both compounds yielded a T/C of 1% with partial responses in 2/10 mice. In the EBC-1 model, treatment with EMD 1214063 (10 mg/kg) or with the antiVEGF antibody B20-4.1 (20 mg/kg) as single agents resulted in a T/C of 21% (with partial regression in 1/10 mice) and 19%, respectively. In contrast, the combination of EMD 1214063 and B20-4.1 exhibited enhanced anti-tumor activity with a T/C of 72% and partial regressions in 10/10 mice. These data support the hypothesis that EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 may be effective in NSCLC patients in combination with VEGF-targeting agents. In conclusion, our findings provide a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 with EGFR and VEGF inhibitors in NSCLC patients.']",

We studied to reveal the role of c-MET overexpression in the resistant lung cancer cell lines and to demonstrate whether MET-inhibition could restore drug sensitivity in anti-cancer drug resistant cell lines via ABC transporters down-regulation. In this study we used the 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothesin (SN-38)-resistant cell line (PC-6/SN-38) that was derived from the human SCLC cell line PC-6. We compared the expression levels of the purposed genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB). MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) assay was used to measure cell viability of the resistant cells compared with the parental cells. Inhibition of c-MET activation was performed by c-MET inhibitors, PHA665752 and Crizotinib or small interfering RNA against c-MET. We found MET inhibitors (4 or 8M) reduced cell growth and restored drug sensitivity (2M) of resistant cells, PC-6/SN38, compared to parental cells. To reveal the mechanisms of c-MET in drug resistance we examined ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters expression in PC-6/SN-38 compared to the parental cells by qRT-PCR, and found the mRNA level of ABCG2, which effluxes SN-38 as substrate, in PC-6/SN-38 cells was extremely increased and another ABC transporters that do not efflux SN-38 were not. Recently we reported PC-6/SN-38 cells had c-MET overexpression, and c-MET inhibition in resistant cells such PC-6/SN-38 resulted in restoration drug resistance. Based on this report we examined c-MET inhibition by c-MET inhibitor and small interfering RNA against c-MET in PC-6/SN38, and qRT-PCR and WB were performed to investigate alteration of ABCG2 expression, and found both two c-MET inhibition reduced ABCG2 expression. In addition, to demonstrate c-MET upregulation in resistant cells is addicted to the ligand HGF, PC-6 cells were incubated with HGF treated for 3 weeks and made PC-6/HGF, then continued to incubate with HGF and SN-38 was added two times in a week. Although c-MET expression is equal in PC-6 and PC-6/HGF, after SN-38 treatment c-MET was overexpressed. Furthermore, serum HGF level in SCLC patients correlated with clinical course. We demonstrated upregulation of ABC transporters via HGF/c-MET signaling activation might be one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to cytotoxic anticancer agents in lung cancer cells. Decreased ABC transporters expression through inhibition of c-MET activation might overcome drug resistance to cytotoxic agents.']",

        "Background":"['Combination therapy of c-Met/EGFR TKIs against c-Met/EGFR, while initially effective, has been shown to be susceptible to acquired resistance. To establish a mechanism of TKI resistance, the NSCLC model cell lines H2170 and H358 were made resistant to the c-Met/EGFR TKIs SU11274, erlotinib, or a combination by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of inhibitors. Phospho-Met (Tyr1003) was found to be downregulated 4- and 1.5- fold in H2170 and H358 cells, respectively. Phospho-EGFR was found to be upregulated in H2170 cells and downregulated in H358 cells. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in c-Met/EGFR downstream signaling proteins, indicating that alternative signaling pathways such as the canonical Wnt pathway may confer TKI resistance. To determine differences in Wnt signaling between parental and resistant cell lines, immunoblotting was performed. In the H2170 erlotinib resistant (H2170-ER) cell line, a 5- and 6-fold increase in phospho-LRP5/6 as well as a 2- and 3-fold increase in total-LRP5/6 was observed in the presence or absence of erlotinib, respectively. Furthermore, H2170-ER cells exhibited a 3- and 16-fold increase in NKD2 as well as a 2.5- and 6-fold increase in Wnt3A in the presence or absence of EGF, respectively. A 2- to 2.5-fold increase was also observed in DVL2/3 in the absence of EGF. However, the Wnt pathway did not seem to have a significant role in H358 cells. Since EGFR and Wnt signaling are known to exhibit crosstalk, activation of the Wnt pathway may stimulate activation of EGFR causing resistance. This is suggested as upregulation of proteins involved in the Wnt pathway was seen only in the H2170 cell line. These results were confirmed by treating H2170 cells with the Wnt inhibitor XAV939. MTT analysis indicated that parental cells showed no significant response to XAV939, however, resistant cell lines showed a 2-fold decrease in viability when compared to a c-Met/EGFR TKI combination treatment. We propose a new treatment modality with Wnt inhibitors which have not yet entered clinical testing.To identify new targets for NSCLC, stable isotope labeling by heavy/light amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled with mass spectroscopy was used. Analysis revealed more than 200 proteins modulated greater than 1.5-fold, six of which have significant potential to influence cell growth and survival based on their biological roles in NSCLC. These proteins include total--catenin, TPR, syntenin, HMGB2, TOM34 and AIF. We are currently using tandem mass tagging (TMT) to further investigate additional modulated proteins. Proteins of interest identified by this method include TPD52, erbB2, MESDC2, PIN1, PEA15 and NRAS. Proteins confirmed to be upregulated/activated in resistant cell lines will be further investigated as targets which induce drug resistance in NSCLC.Citation Format', ' Ryan Jacobs, Jason Fong, David Moravec, Greg Botting, Ryan Bomgarden, John Rogers, Rosa Viner, Michael Blank, Neelu Puri.

The majority of adverse events observed to date have been grade 1/2 in severity; grade 3 disease-related dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pleural effusion were observed in one patient and grade 3 tepotinib-related elevated serum amylase in another. Of the 3 pts with post-baseline tumor evaluations, two have had an unconfirmed partial response and the third (with only one post-baseline assessment) stable disease.

        "Background":"['NSCLC tumors acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs, and studies have suggested that co-localization of c-MET and EGFR may be a modality of acquired resistance. Upregulation of alternative signaling pathways such as Wnt or mTOR have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis and are a potential mechanism of resistance. This study aims at examining these signaling pathways and EGFR/c-MET co-expression in 100 patients with stage I-IV NSCLC. We have data on 50 patients, and are working on the remaining samples. Tumor tissue from biopsies or resections have been obtained with IRB approval, processed, sectioned, and mounted on microscope slides. Total and active forms of EGFR, c-MET, mTOR, S6K, beta-catenin, and Axin2 were detected using singleplex or multiplex IHC staining procedures, and stains were graded by an independent pathologist using a validated scoring system. We selected Stage IV NSCLC (n = 32) patients to correlate EGFR/c-MET expression with overall survival, and analyzed them for months to mortality based on high or low EGFR expression. Patients with high EGFR expression (n = 16) showed lower overall survival compared to those with low EGFR expression (n = 16). Expression of c-MET is linked to decreased survival in Stage IV NSCLC patients (n = 4). Patients with EGFR/c-MET co-localization (n = 19) showed decreased overall survival compared to patients without EGFR/c-MET co-localization (n = 9). Elevated mTOR and p-mTOR are associated with worse prognosis in Stage IV NSCLC patients. Patients categorized with either low mTOR expression (n = 10) or high mTOR expression (n = 19) showed increased mortality with high mTOR expression (5.9 months) compared to patients with low mTOR expression (13.5 months). A similar trend was seen in patients with either low (n = 4, 7.5 months) or high (n = 24, 15.9 months) p-mTOR expression. Patients with low beta-catenin expression (n = 4) showed improved survival in comparison to patients with high beta-catenin expression (n = 18), 9.4 months vs 6.3 months, respectively. To determine correlations in expression of these proteins we found that EGFR/c-MET co-expression is inversely correlated with active beta-catenin and directly correlated with a negative regulator of beta-catenin, Axin-2 suggesting EGFR/c-MET co-expression is associated with a downregulation of Wnt activity. In contrast, elevated EGFR/c-MET co-expression and co-activation is statistically significantly correlated with elevated mTOR-S6K expression and activation suggesting EGFR/c-MET co-expression is associated with an upregulation of the mTOR pathway activity. Elevated mTOR pathway activation at the time of diagnosis is statistically significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with stage IV NSCLC. These preliminary results suggest that mTOR inhibition therapy in addition to EGFR/c-MET inhibition therapies may be beneficial in this population.']",

To determine mechanisms of TKI resistance, two NSCLC model cell lines H2170 and H358 were made resistant to the c-Met/EGFR TKIs SU11274, erlotinib or a combination of both by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of inhibitor. Initial characterization of these cell lines using phospho-specific antibodies showed that phospho-c-Met was found to be downregulated 4- and 1.5- fold in SU11274-resistant (SR) H2170 and SR H358 cells, respectively. Phospho-EGFR was found to be constitutively autophosphorylated (upregulated 19-fold) in erlotinib-resistant (ER) H2170 cells, but downregulated 6-fold in ER H358 cells. Interestingly, c-Met/EGFR downstream signaling proteins p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-ERK were found to be 2-4-fold upregulated, 2-fold upregulated and 2-5-fold upregulated, respectively, in ER H2170 and H358 cells. Phospho-p70S6K was also found to be upregulated 20-fold in SR H2170 cells. These results indicate that alternative signaling pathways may confer TKI resistance in these cell lines. To identify which signaling pathways may be responsible for TKI resistance, H358 parental and resistant cell lines were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Differences in protein expression in cell lines treated with and without EGF and/or erlotinib were measured using higher multiplexing Thermo Scientific Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) reagents. More than 1500 protein groups were identified and quantified using a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion platform with HCD-MS2 and MS3 fragmentation methods. Protein expression in ER H358 cells showed a marked increase in expression of DNA replication proteins, transcription factors, apoptosis inhibitors and some Ras-associated signal transduction pathways. To further investigate the mechanism of TKI resistance, phospho-peptide enrichment was also used in combination with TMT quantitation to profile changes in protein phosphorylation state. Overall, the combination of phospho-peptide enrichment coupled with higher multiplexing TMT and high resolution MS analysis enabled deeper global profiling of TKI resistance signaling pathways compared to previous studies without enrichment.']",

Recent investigations suggest that aberrant activation of the c-Met receptor through c-Met amplification and/or HGF upregulation may be an additional mechanism for acquired resistance. Combination of an EGFR TKI with a c-Met inhibitor could, therefore, delay and/or prevent the emergence of c-Met-driven resistance.The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of MSC2156119J, a highly selective small molecule c-Met inhibitor, as monotherapy or in combination with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib) in human xenograft models transplanted with two different primary NSCLC explants, LU342 and LU0858. While both tumors express the activated EGFR mutant form, LU342 expresses low levels of c-Met, while LU0858 expresses high levels of c-Met and carries an amplified c-Met locus.Single-agent MSC2156119J was inactive against the low c-Met-expressing LU342 explant and tumors progressed on treatment (median tumor volume [TV] change >73%). Erlotinib treatment resulted in tumor regression, with median TV change of -93% and tumor growth delay (TGD) of 56 days. The combination of MSC2156119J and erlotinib was more active, delaying tumor regrowth by 73 days compared to erlotinib monotherapy. Administration of afatinib at 5mg/kg was highly active in this model, inducing complete tumor regression (median TV change -100%), similar to the combination of afatinib and MSC2156119J.In contrast, the LU0858 explant, which carries an amplified c-Met locus, was sensitive to MSC2156119J at a dose of 100mg/kg 5 days on and 2 days off (5 on/2 off), inducing tumor stasis with a median TV change of 19% and TGD of 34 days. While gefitinib and afatinib alone at doses of 150mg/kg 5 on/2 off and 5mg/kg 5 on/2 off, respectively, were inactive (median TV changes >73%), in combination with MSC2156119J tumor growth inhibition was enhanced, resulting in tumor regression (median TV changes of -64% and -85%, respectively). In comparison, tumors treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin 5mg/kg QW/pemetrexed 200mg/kg QW) progressed, with TGD of 16 days. When MSC2156119J was combined with cisplatin/pemetrexed, antitumor activity was not significantly enhanced compared to single-agent MSC2156119J (median TV change -32%, TGD 30 days).Together, these findings are compatible with the hypothesis that inhibition of the c-Met pathway prevents and/or delays the emergence of c-Met-driven resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Furthermore, the enhancement of antitumor activity in the low c-Met-expressing LU342 model when MSC2156119J was combined with erlotinib suggests that the combination of an EGFR TKI + MSC2156119J may also be active in tumors with low levels of c-Met expression.']",

Mice were treated with IR either alone or in combination with Erlotinib or Crizotinib; response to treatment was evaluated by tumour volume measurement.RESULTS', ' EGFR-TKI resistant HCC827 cell lines were generated following successive cycles of treatment. Amplification of c-MET was identified in a number of clones, but no Her2 amplification or gatekeeper mutations; therefore Crizotinib, a c-MET inhibitor, was selected for evaluation in these models.When assessed in vivo, treatment of parental HCC827 xenografts with targeted IR or Erlotinib treatment resulted in tumour regression. However, in the c-MET driven resistant model, both the IR and Erlotinib response was significantly attenuated, resulting in tumour re-growth. Combination testing with Crizotinib restored the efficacy of both IR and Erlotinib to nave treatment levels confirming the role of c-MET in resistance.CONCLUSIONS', ' Resistance to EGFRi and IR in a HCC827 model is driven by c-MET amplification.

The percentages of high MET or HGF expression (2+ or 3+) were higher in ALK+ group compared to ALK- (58% vs 32%, p=0.06, and 37% vs 11%, p=0.03). The correlation coefficient between MET and HGF expression was 0.48. MET gene amplification by DISH was detected in 15% (7/47) ALK- tumors but 0% (0/15) ALK+ tumors (difference not statistically significant, p=0.18). The correlation coefficient between MET IHC and MET gene amplification was 0.33.  Conclusions', '  MET and HGF expression is commonly seen in NSCLC, with more frequent high expression levels in ALK+ than ALK- tumors. Using a newly developed DISH method, we show that MET gene amplification tend to be less frequent in ALK+ tumor.

ALK translocation is a robust predictive factor for ALK inhibitors sensitivity. However, increased ALK gene copy number seems to be a frequent event, described in 13-17% of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of this study was to explore the predictive value of ALK High copy number for 2 ALK inhibitors, crizotinib and TAE684 in NSCLC cell lines. Methods', ' 27 NSCLC cell lines were screened for ALK copy number by FISH after cytospin. ALK high copy number (HCN) was defined as the presence of  5 copies of ALK. FISH with CEP2 was performed to determine the plody status in cell lines with HCN. As crizotinib is a dual c-MET and ALK inhibitor, FISH c-MET was performed in selected cell lines for in vitro studies. C-MET scoring was based on Cappuzzo criteria. In vitro sensitivity was evaluated through WST1 assays and clonogenic tests. Kelly, an ALK mutated neuroblastic cell line, was added as a positive control. Cells were seeded in triplicates in 96-well plates 18h before the treatment with TAE 684 or crizotinib with concentrations varying from 50 to 4000nM and 100 to 10000nM respectively. The half maximal inhibitory concentration of the two drugs (IC50) was estimated after 72h of treatment with 4 and 5 parameters logistic regression models. In clonogenic tests, crizotinib was tested with three schedules of concentrations', ' low dose (50nM), intermediate (200nM) and high (1000nM). Results', ' Among NSCLC cell lines, 6 (22%) displayed more than 5 copies of ALK, 19 (70%) presented a gain of 3 or 4 ALK copy number, only one cell line exhibited normal ALK copies and one harbored EML4-ALK translocation. FISH with CEP2 revealed a polysomy of chromosome 2 in cases with ALK HCN. C-MET amplification was observed in only three cell lines. Based on ALK FISH status, 9 NSCLC cell lines were selected to undergo in vitro assays, 6 exhibiting ALK HCN (H2030, H661, A427, H3255, BEN, H1299) and 3 exhibiting low ALK copy number (LCN) (H1975, H1651, H1650). Kelly and A549 cell lines were added as sensitive and resistant controls respectively. In ALK HCN cell lines, two (H661 and A427) were as sensitive as Kelly for crizotinib through clonogenic and WST1 assays.

We compared two platforms for CTC capture, CellSearch and ISET, and assessed MET expression in CTCs vs. matched bronchial biopsies in patients with advanced-stage III/IV lung adenocarcinomaDesign', ' CTC capture and MET expression in CTCs was evaluated in 358 MET positive NSCLC patients (Phase III OAM4971 trial) using the CellSearch platform. CTC capture and MET expression was evaluated in a cohort of 80 CTC-positive NSCLC patients using the ISET platform (filtration).

        "Background":"['The development of therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis, tumor driver gene alterations and tumor immune evasion has made tremendous advancement in improving overall survival. However, efficacy may be limited and resistance often develops rapidly when targeting a single axis of tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore rational combination of therapies based on tumor-specific features. Fruquintinib is a potent and selective oral VEGFR inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). We report here the evaluation of anti-tumor effect of fruquintinib in preclinical animal tumor models in combination with therapies targeting tumor driver gene alterations such as EGFR and c-MET or with immune checkpoints. In NSCLC xenograft models with EGFR activation such as activating mutations, gene amplification or protein overexpression, fruquintinib plus an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as gefitinib or theliatinib (HMPL-309) was found to be more efficacious than either monotherapy. For instance, in PC-9 subcutaneous tumor model carrying EGFR exon 19 deletion, single agent treatment with fruquintinib at 2 mg/kg and gefitinib at 5 mg/kg produced the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 58% and 63%, respectively, while the combination treatment resulted in a TGI of 100% and tumor regression was observed in 11 of 16 mice treated with combinational therapy. In multiple xenograft models derived from lung cancer or renal cell cancer with c-MET activation (amplification or over-expression), addition of fruquintinib to a c-MET inhibitor savolitinib (AZD6094, HMPL-504) also improved the tumor growth inhibition substantially. At the end of the efficacy studies, CD31 and phosphorylation of EGFR, c-MET, AKT and ERK were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and western blotting method in tumor tissues. The results suggested that the enhanced anti-tumor effect in combination therapy could be attributed to the simultaneous blockade of cell signaling in tumor cells (EGFR or c-MET) and VEGFR suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Up-regulation of the immune inhibitory checkpoints induced by VEGF is one of the important mechanisms for tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. In a syngeneic murine tumor model, co-administration of fruquintinib and anti-PD-L1 antibody was found to provide improved anti-tumor effect compared to fruquintinib or anti-PD-L1 single agent alone. Studies to understand the mechanism responsible for the combination effect are under way. All combinations with fruquintinib described above were well tolerated. The efficacy observed in these models suggested that simultaneous blockade of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell signaling or immune evasion may be a promising approach in improving treatment outcomes.']",

The effects of EMD1214063 on Met expression, cell viability, migration and cell radiosensitivity were assessed. Various scheduling effect on the magnitude of increased cell radiosensitivity was evaluated. 53BP1 foci formation was assayed for DNA repair kinetics. In vivo tumor growth delay assays on two NSCLCs and two HNSCCs generated in mice were performed to test the efficacy of EMD1214063 on tumor growth and tumor response to radiation.Results', ' NSCLC lines expressed higher levels of Met than HNSCC lines. EMD1214063 reduced survival of NSCLC lines markedly and had a minimal effect on HNSCC lines in vitro. Western blots showed three major Met protein bands with molecular weights of about 145 kDa, 60 kDa and 45 kDa. Radiation increased the expression levels of the 145 kDa and 60 kDa fragments of Met in a dose dependent manner. EMD1214063 suppressed the radiation-induced expression of Met and prolonged the presence of 53BP1 foci. It potently enhanced the radiosensitivity of A549, H1993, HN-5 and FaDu but not that of H460 and UMSCC-1. The enhancement factors at the survival fraction of 0.5 ranged from 1.11 to 2.24, with H1993 being the most responsive cell line.

Stratification is by ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2), smoking status (nonsmoker vs. light ex-smoker) and gender.  Pts will be treated in continuous 28-day cycles, during which all pts will receive G daily (250 mg/day PO), and pts randomized to ficlatuzumab + G will also receive ficlatuzumab (20 mg/kg IV) on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.  Pts who progress after achieving initial disease control (CR, PR, or SD for 12 weeks or longer) in the G alone arm may cross over to the combination arm.   The primary objective is to compare the Objective Response Rate (ORR) between the arms.  Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ficlatuzumab +  G, response duration, Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and Overall Survival (OS), to investigate the relationship between the anti-tumor activity of ficlatuzumab + G and molecular markers such as activating EGFR mutations, cMet and EGFR gene copy numbers (FISH positivity), HGF, c-Met and p-Met expression, HGF serum levels, and to assess whether acquired resistance to G can be overcome with the addition of ficlatuzumab in pts who progressed after initial demonstration of disease control (CR, PR, or SD for 12 weeks or longer) in the G alone arm.

Platinum-based combination regimen or molecular target drugs, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and ALK inhibitors are used for first line chemotherapy of NSCLC. Somatic mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been identified in NSCLC and those mutations confer sensitivity to the EGFR-TKIs such as gefitinib. Unfortunately, it is well known that the almost cases are developed to drug resistance after chemotherapy. Several EGFR-TKI resistant mechanisms have been reported, including gatekeeper mutation (T790M), c-MET amplification and ErbB3 activation. Re-biopsy is generally required for determine the resistance mechanism and second line chemotherapy. However, re-biopsy is invasive test for cancer patients. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) are paid attention as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and sensitivity to chemotherapy in various cancers. In the previous study, we revealed that the miRNA biosynthesis pathway is critical for maintain the cisplatin resistant phenotype. Further, it was reported that EGFR modulated microRNA maturation through the phosphorylation of AGO2. Protein phosphorylation is one of most important post transcriptional modification mechanisms and miRNA is also associated with fine tuning of mRNA expression. Thus, we focused on the relationship between miRNA expression and kinase signaling in gefitinib resistance. In this study, we performed characterization of gefitinib resistant cell lines, PC-9/MET200 and PC-9/MET1000 established from NSCLC cell line, PC-9, which were confirmed to have a c-MET amplification using miRNA microarray and quantitative PCR. Furthermore, we analyzed miRNA activity and kinase signaling using a luciferase reporter assay system, siRNA, RTK/phosphokinase protein array and kinase inhibitors. We revealed that miR-205 was significantly elevated in both gefitinib resistant cell lines. By the computational analysis using miRNA target prediction database, we found that ErbB3 was a target of miR-205. However, ErbB3 expression levels were rather up-regulated and highly phosphorylated in both resistant cell lines compared with a parental cell line. Under ErbB3 knockdown condition, miR-205 expression levels were slightly down regulated. Furthermore, under c-MET knockdown or Foretinib treatment condition, miR-205 activity were down regulated and ErbB3 dephosphorylated in resistant cell lines. This down-regulation of miR-205 appears to be mediated by inhibition of kinase signals. Moreover, we found that some kinase inhibitors suppressed miR-205 activity in gefitinib resistant cell lines. In conclusion, our results suggest that alterations of kinase signals are more effective for miR-205 regulation than protein expression of target molecule itself, such as ErbB3.']",

Other mechanisms of clinical resistance can also occur such as amplification of c-MET kinase, Her-2 and EMT conversion; however, additional routes of resistance are poorly defined.

H2170 cell line express high levels of EGFR and c-Met and are EGFR wild-type. The H3255 cell line is positive for an EGFR TKD mutation, L858R, and is sensitive to initial TKI treatment. The H1975 cell line is positive for two EGFR TKD mutations, T790M and L858R, which confer resistance to erlotinib.Previous studies in our lab have shown that activation of alternative signaling pathways lead to the development of TKI resistance. In the wild type TKI resistant cells, H2170 erlotinib resistant (ER) and H2170 SU11274 resistant(SR), we observed activation of Wnt and mTOR pathway along with increased accumulation of -catenin in the nucleus. However, in H1975 cells with mutated EGFR (L858R and T790M), we observed activation of only mTOR pathway. -catenin is associated with Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), during which cells lose tight junction proteins such E-Cadherin and gain expression of transcriptional proteins such as -catenin and ZEB1, which may lead to aberrant activation of Wnt signaling pathway and increased motility and invasion. Activation of mTOR pathway leads to increased expression of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 which are key translational regulators.We found increased accumulation of active -catenin in the nucleus by 1.9-2.5 folds and 2.9-3.1 folds in H2170 ER and SR cells, respectively, compared to H2170 parental cells. In H2170 ER cells we observed modulations in key EMT-related proteins, N-Cadherin (2-3.3 fold) and Claudin-1 (2.5-14 fold) were upregulated and Snail was downregulated 1.7-2.5 fold in the presence and absence of erlotinib and EGF, when compared to H2170 parental cells. Similarly in H2170 SR cells we observed upregulation of N-Cadherin (1.3-2.3 fold) and Zeb-1 (1.2-1.4 fold) and downregulation of ZO-1 (1.4-1.9 fold) and E-Cadherin (1.5-2.0 fold) in the presence and absence of HGF and SU11274 when compared to H2170 parental cells. Morphological changes indicative of EMT were detected using immunostaining with Vimentin and E-Cadherin antibodies, which displayed increased Vimentin filaments (2-fold) and loss of E-Cadherin (5-10 fold) in H2170 ER cells when compared to H2170 parental cells. In H1975 cells we observed that proteins related to mTOR signaling pathway such as p-mTOR, p-GSK3-, p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K were upregulated 2.5 fold, 4-5 fold, 2.2-2.4 fold, and 4.4-10.4 fold, respectively, when compared to H3255 cells in the presence of erlotinib. Based on these results, we treated H1975 cells with combination of EGFR and mTOR inhibitors. We observed that 1 M everolimus with 2.5 M erlotinib synergistically inhibited cell growth by 53%.

Methods', '  Four-hundred-and sixty Asian (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) pts who had been treated with 1-2 chemotherapy for non-squamous NSCLC with WT-EGFR were planned to be randomized between T+E and P+E.

The primary endpoint was OS, and secondary endpoints included PFS, ORR, and safety. Exploratory analysis tested biomarkers including c-Met expression and KRAS mutation.  Results', '  New enrollment was stopped when 307 pts had been randomized, following the Safety Review Committees recommendation based on an observed imbalance in interstitial lung disease (ILD) between the groups.

However, patients invariably develop resistance through secondary EGFR mutations, c-MET amplification, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), small cell lung cancer transformation, PIK3CA mutation and other unknown mechanisms. Here we examined whether Cripto1, which has been shown to induce EMT, could cause erlotinib resistance. We show that innate erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinomas carrying sensitizing EGFR mutations exhibit higher level of Cripto1 expression than their erlotinib sensitive counterparts. Ectopic expression of Cripto1 rendered erlotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma cells resistant to erlotinib both in vitro and in a xenograft model. Moreover, Cripto1 activated Zeb1/EMT signaling pathway in EGFR-TKI resistant cells. High Cripto1 expression correlated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Our study provides a novel Cripto1-dependent mechanism of EGFR-TKI resistance that may pave the way for the development of therapies to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer patients.']",

EGFR can be a partner of heterodimer of other EGFR family such as HER2 and HER3. EGFR is often overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Anti-EGFR agents including EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have considered to be effective for NSCLC when drug sensitive EGFR mutation is present. However, inherent and acquired resistances are major problems of EGFR targeting therapies. In this study, we knock-downed EGFR using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in NSCLC cell lines to examine the significance of targeting EGFR for NSCLC therapy. Materials and methods', ' We treated 14 NSCLC cell lines including nine EGFR mutant and five EGFR wild-type cell lines by geftinib or siRNAs for EGFR knock-down (siR-EGFR).

Among the most significant treatment advancement in recent years are the introduction of target therapies of EGFR-TKIs (Erlotinib and Gefitinib) for adenocarcinoma with EGFR activating mutations, and Crizotinib for NSCLC with ALK activation (EML4-ALK fusion)1. ALK activation are associated with a subset of NSCLC patients (35%).Crizotinib is considered not a particularly potent ALK inhibitor, with IC50 at range of tens of nanomoles. It may not be an ideal agent for treating NSCLC with activating ALK. Therefore, a new ALK inhibitor with better potency and specificity could be of particularly medical importance. Currently, the industry is actively searching for such new agents. A relevant experimental model could also greatly facilitate evaluating and validating these new drug candidates.Patient derived xenografts (PDX) (including NSCLC PDX) mirror patients histopathology and genetic profiles2, thus known as patient avatar. It has improved predictive power as preclinical cancer models, and enables discovery of predictive biomarkers for targeted therapeutics. We have established a large collection of NSCLC PDX models (NSCLC-HuPrime) by engrafting nave patient tumor tissues into immune-compromised mice2.Among these models, we have identified one model, LU1656, of NSCL carcinosarcoma histology and with EML4-ALK fusion mutation. This mutation apparently causes over-expression of ALK as measured at mRNA level. This model has wild-type KRAS, c-MET and EGFR genes. Treatment of LU1656 with Crizotinib caused significant but not complete tumor response, suggesting ALK activation is one of the oncogenic drivers of this model. In addition, LU1656 also responded to Cetuximab, but respond poorly to Erlotinib. It would be interesting to examine the combination of these treatments. This model is, to our knowledge, the first reported PDX model with EML4-ALK fusion mutation.

To our knowledge, this was the first study to demonstrate the tumor oncogene phenotype of sprouty-2 in colon cancer metastasis. On the contrary, cancer protective role of sprouty-2 was noted in breast, liver and prostate cancers. However, a recent report on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) discovered that silencing of sprouty-2 reduced c-met expression and thus confirmed our findings in colorectal cancer (PNAS, 110', ' 8573-78, 2013). We further extended our studies to demonstrate that this pathway modulates gastrointestinal specific microRNAs (miRNAs) and regulates various oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in colon cancer cells. Methods', ' RNA from control and shRNA sprouty-2 transfected cells were labeled with Hy5 and Hy3 respectively and hybridized to miRCURY LNA arrays. Unsupervised miRNA clustering was carried out and a heat map prepared with Java TreeView. MicroRNA targets were identified by Real-time PCR, western blotting and 3UTR luciferase assays. Migratory phenotype of colon cancer cells was confirmed by cell migration and invasion assays in trans-well chambers. Cancer cells were transfected by miRNA mimics to assess the expression levels of target genes. Human colon cancer tissue microarrays were utilized to assess the expression of miRNA target genes. Human tumor sections were evaluated by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Results', ' Sprouty-2 shRNA transfected stable cell lines demonstrated upregulation of tumor suppressive miRNAs and down-regulation of oncogenic miRNAs. Overexpression of gastrointestinal specific miRNA mimics inhibits colon cancer cells proliferation and metastasis. On the contrary, overexpression of miRNA inhibitor in colon cancer cells promotes proliferation and colonization. Studies further indicated that miRNA down-regulates expression of CDK7, RB1, AKT, FASL, IGF1R, EGFR and N-cadherin and up-regulates expression of P21 and E-cadherin. MiRNA regulated genes were responsible for cell cycle arrest, enhanced apoptosis and decreased metastasis. AKT was upregulated whereas E-cadherin was downregulated at the invasive fronts in human colon tumors.

        "Background":"['Although a large fraction of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are dependent on defined oncogenic driver mutations, little progress has been made in the treatment of patients with the most frequently observed driver mutation, mutant KRAS. Acquired resistance to therapy targeting other driver mutations (EGFR mutant and ALK translocation positive tumors) is all but inevitable. We recently demonstrated that Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, cooperates with mutant Kras to induce lung adenocarcinoma in mouse models, and that inhibition of Twist1 in murine models and human lung cancer cell lines led to oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and in some cases, apoptosis. We have also found that TWIST1 is essential for tumor maintenance in human NSCLCs characterized by oncogenic drivers including KRAS mutation, EGFR mutation and c-MET amplification. As TWIST1 is not typically expressed post-natally, therapies directed against TWIST1 may present a more specific and perhaps less toxic therapy. Targeting the TWIST1 pathway represents an exciting and novel therapeutic strategy which may have a significant clinical impact.We employed a combined bioinformatics-chemical approach to identify pharmacologic inhibitors of TWIST1. We used gene expression profiles from several KRAS mutant human NSCLC cell lines following shRNA-mediated TWIST1 knockdown to perform connectivity map (CMAP) analysis. We found that several of our highly ranked compounds had significant growth inhibitory effects in NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, several of our candidate agents produced dose-dependent inhibition of TWIST1-induced dissemination in a novel 3D organoid dissemination assay. Interestingly, a family of related harmala alkaloids including harmine ranked highly on the CMAP analysis. We found that harmine could not only inhibit growth in several oncogene driver defined NSCLC cell lines through the induction of apoptosis but could also decrease TWIST1 levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism. The growth inhibitory effects of the harmala alkaloids correlated with the ability to degrade TWIST1. Additionally, independent of our CMAP analysis, we identified another compound, salinomycin, which appears to modulate cancer cell growth and resulted in a decrease in TWIST1 levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism as well. Interestingly, salinomycin treatment induced a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) in NSCLC which could be partially blocked in TWIST1 overexpressing NSCLC cell lines. We are currently examining the in vivo efficacy of these agents. In conclusion, we have identified several compounds that inhibit TWIST1 dependent dissemination and in some cases can lead to TWIST1 degradation. Since TWIST1 is essential for not only KRAS mutant NSCLC but more broadly for oncogene driven NSCLC, these studies could lead to the development of a novel class of inhibitors which could have a significant clinical impact.']",

        "Background":"['A large fraction of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have mutant KRAS, which is associated with poor response to current cytotoxic therapy and a poor prognosis. Although the KRAS signaling pathway has been well characterized, no current therapies target this critical oncogene. Several studies have demonstrated that bypass of senescence in Kras-mediated adenocarcinoma mouse models is essential for tumorigenesis. Therefore, activation of senescence in KRAS mutant NSCLC may be an effective therapeutic strategy. We recently demonstrated that the basic helix loop helix transcription factor Twist1 cooperates with mutant Kras to induce lung adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse models and that inhibition of Twist1 in these models led to activation of Kras-induced senescence and tumor stasis. In the current study, we examine the role of TWIST1 in KRAS mutant human NSCLC. Silencing of TWIST1 in multiple KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines resulted in dramatic growth inhibition and either reactivation of oncogene-induced senescence or in some cases, apoptosis. Similar effects were also observed in four KRAS wild type lines, including cell lines with key driver mutations including a cell line with an activating EGFR mutation and a cell line with c-Met amplification. Gene set enrichment analysis of NSCLC cell lines after silencing of TWIST1 revealed a striking cell cycle arrest gene signature. Growth inhibition by silencing of TWIST1 was independent of p53 or Rb/p16 mutational status. Furthermore, activation of oncogene-induced senescence by TWIST1 silencing did not require previously defined mediators of senescence, p21 and p27, nor could this phenotype be rescued by overexpression of SKP2. To extend these observations in vivo, TWIST1 was silenced in both KRAS mutant and wildtype cell lines and these cells were implanted in NOD-SCID mice to assess tumor formation. Interestingly, silencing of TWIST1 in xenograft models preferentially inhibited KRAS mutant tumor formation suggesting that TWIST1 plays a critical in mediating KRAS tumorigenesis. Finally, inducible silencing of TWIST1 resulted in significant growth inhibition of established xenograft KRAS mutant tumors. Together these findings suggest TWIST1 is essential for the establishment and maintenance of KRAS mutant NSCLC tumors and silencing of TWIST1 in KRAS mutant NSCLC represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy.']",

Crizotinib achieved robust objective response rates of approximately 60% in ALK+ NSCLC and significantly improved progression free survival compared to chemotherapy. The emergence of secondary mutations within the ALK kinase domain or the activation of compensatory signaling pathways in crizotinib and other ALKi refractory tumors prompted searches for next generation of ALKi active against resistance mutations as single agents or in combination with other treatments. Such effort led to our recent discovery of PF-06463922, an ALK/ROS1 inhibitor with greatly improved ALK potency, brain penetration, and broad spectrum activity against all known clinical ALKi-resistant mutations. PF-06463922 is being tested in a Phase I clinical trial in both ALK+ and ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC in treatment naive or ALKi relapsed patients.In our current preclinical study, we explored rational combination strategies to further improve the efficacy of PF-06463922 in ALKi resistant cells or tumors.

Using metabolic (ATP-content; mitochondrial) & morphologic (membrane integrity) endpoints, dose response curves were interpolated to LC50 values for comparison of activity by patient & tumor type. Patients were screened for ALK & ROS-1 by FISH.  Results', '  ALK (+) tumors reveal lower LC50s (3.4 uM) vs. ROS-1 (+) (11.5 uM), despite clinical responses in both groups. A Criz-responding patient, at 2nd biopsy for progression, reverted to Criz-resistance but developed collateral sensitivity to cytotoxics that provided durable response. Despite FISH (-), a 39 y/o nonsmoker male, revealed exquisite sensitivity to Criz by repeat EVA/PCD. At our insistence, FISH conducted at a 2nd reference lab correctly identified ALK(+) qualifying for Criz, to which he responded, now at year 2. Using low LC50 as a phenotypicmarker of Criz responsiveness, we identified activity in an extremely rare pediatric sarcoma patient. When, secondarily screened, patient found ALK (+), followed by rapid objective response to Criz.  Conclusions', '  Primary culture analyses provide insights into Criz activity including ALK (+) vs. ROS-1(+), individual patient response profiles, and the identification of Criz candidates, who might otherwise not be screened for sensitizing mutations. By capturing human tumors in their native state EVA/PCD offers opportunities to study Criz for unrecognized targets and analyze novel strategies including synergy & sequence dependence, less readily examined with genomic platforms.']",

        "Background":"['Although transforming growth factor  (TGF) is anti-cancer identified, it was also known to promote tumor malignancy by enhancing the growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), tissue invasion and metastasis in a variety of cancer cells, including non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The aim of this study was to know the contribution of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) to TGF-promoted EMT and metastasis in NSCLCs. The degree of EMT, cell scattering, migration and invasion, and protein expression of PPAR were first analyzed and compared between H460 and CH27 cells with or without TGF treatment (both are NSCLC cell lines). Chemical or shRNA blocking assay was also utilized to further confirm the importance of PPAR in promoting TGF-induced tumor metastasis. Finally, signaling pathway(s) responsible for TGF/PPAR-mediated metastasis was evaluated. The results demonstrated that TGF can effectively triggered the EMT, cell scattering, migration and invasion in H460 cell, but only a slight EMT was seen in TGF-treated CH27 cell. Meanwhile, PPAR expression was induced by TGF in H460 cells but remained unchanged in CH27 cell. This indicated that PPAR may involve in TGF-mediated metastasis. Co-treatment of TGF with GW9662 (a specific PPAR inhibitor) significantly blocked TGF-promoted metastasis of H460 cell indicating the presence of PPAR was indeed critical for TGF-attributed tumor metastasis. TGF appeared to act through P38 signaling pathway to trigger the expression of PPAR and the subsequent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) signaling pathway and the reduction of E-cadherin that eventually led to the EMT and metastasis of H460 cell. Additionally, TGF also act through P38 to trigger the expression of -catenin which could bind to and up-regulate the expression of PPAR. Blocking of -catenin activity, however, did not interfere with the metastasis indicating -catenin may not play a direct role in promoting the metastasis of H460 cell. Nevertheless, we can not preclude the possibility that -catenin may still act through PPAR to regulate the metastasis of H460 cell, indirectly. In summary, TGF-induced EMT and metastasis in H460 cell was PPAR-dependent and GW9662 revealed a therapeutical value in the control of NSCLCs (H460).']",

        "Background":"['Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is thought to have a role in the cancer progression and survival, and many carcinomas are known to overexpress IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R). Furthermore, it was clarified that IGF1R signaling contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. IGF1R is thought to be a therapeutic target for cancer chemotherapy. Previously, we screened the combination effect of afatinib and various anticancer drugs on a panel of NSCLC cell lines including gefitinib-resistant and afatinib-resistant PC-9 cells which we established. As the result, the combination of afatinib and small molecule IGF1R-TKIs (BMS754807, NVP-ADW742) has shown the most cytotoxicity on wide variety cancer cells. However, these IGF1R-TKIs have cross-reactivity to insulin receptor and, as a result, are known to cause hyperglycemia. Moreover, a phase III trial of the combination chemotherapy between erlotinib and IGF1R specific antibody, figitumumab, in advanced nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC patients (ADVIGO 1018)was closed early because of futility and an increased incidence of serious adverse events.BI836845 is a humanized IGF ligand-neutralizing antibody which is neutralizing both IGF-1 and IGF-2. The proliferation of several cell lines was reported to be potently inhibited by BI 836845 with lower than 100 g/ml EC50 values. This antibody is thought to be a substitute approach to inhibit IGF1R signaling pathway other than previous IGF1R-TKIs. We evaluated the combination effect of afatinib and BI836845 on the same NSCLC panel by MTS assay. BI836845 had only a limited cytotoxicity by itself. The combination of afatinib and BI836845 had additive or synergistic cytotoxicity on most of the NSCLC cell lines including EGFR-TKIs-resistant cells except the cells overexpressing c-Met or expressing K-ras mutation. This combination significantly inhibited both EGFR and IGF1R autophosphorylation and their downstream signaling, especially Akt/mTOR pathway, as compared with each singular usage. These combination effects were attenuated when BI836845 combined with erlotinib. Since BI836845 cross-react to rodent IGFs, we examined pharmacological activity of this combination using SCID mice xenograft mode. The mice bearing tumor were given 6 mg/kg afatinib (5 times/week, p.o.) and 200 mg/kg BI836845 (1 time/week, i.p.) for 8 weeks. This combination synergistically inhibited afatinib-resistant tumor (PC-9Afa1, PC-9Afa2) and gefitinib-resistant tumor (PC-9ZD, expressed T790M mutant EGFR). This BI836845 administration completely inhibited IGFs activity in the mice serum without alteration of blood sugar level and insulin concentration. Though growth rate of the treated mice was slightly reduced, body weight loss and other serious adverse events were not observed.From these observations, this combination chemotherapy is thought to be a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.']",

Crizotinib, a c-MET and ALK inhibitor, has shown significant therapeutic benefit as a single agent with FDA approval for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Since radiation commonly plays a key role in lung cancer treatment, we sought to evaluate the potential of crizotinib as a radiation sensitizer and the role of ALK in cellular radiation sensitivity. We examined the effect of crizotinib in combination with radiation on ALK signaling, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and radiosensitivity in ALK-positive NSCLC cell lines H3122 and H2228 in vitro. We also examined the in-vivo effects of crizotinib in combination with radiation in H3122 and H2228 xenograft models.Crizotinib blocked phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream effectors and inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of crizotinib and radiation resulted in increased inhibition of cell growth. Although cells were sensitized to radiation by crizotinib, molecular knockdown of ALK by siRNA had only modest impact on cell radiosensitivity. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that ALK-siRNA induced G1 arrest. Interestingly, low dose crizotinib induced G1 arrest, while doses above 2M induced G2 arrest. Combination treatment induced arrest in G1 and G2 phases and decreased the cell population in S-phase. Moreover, in xenograft tumor models, we observed combined treatment to produce additive tumor growth inhibition over that observed with either drug or radiation alone.We further examined the capacity of crizotinib overcome cetuximab resistance in our established in vitro resistance models. Compared with parental cells, cetuximab-resistant cells showed cross-resistance to radiation. Crizotinib inhibited the growth of cetuximab-resistant cells and resensitized cells to radiation. Compared with single-agent treatment, the combination of crizotinib and erlotinib resulted in increased growth inhibition and further re-sensitization to radiation.These data suggest that crizotinib in combination with radiation can enhance the inhibitory effect on ALK-positive tumor cell growth in vitro and in-vivo and also suggest the potential value of using crizotinib in combination with other EGFR-targeting therapeutics.

However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas.

        "Background":"['NSCLC cells acquire resistance to EGFR and c-Met TKIs after prolonged use. Our studies indicate that resistance maybe due to upregulation of alternative signaling pathways such as Wnt and mTOR. We have found that activation of Wnt/-Catenin is also associated with EMT which results in loss of cell adhesion properties and gain of motility and invasiveness. To understand the mechanism of TKI resistance in NSCLC cells with wild type EGFR, we have developed and used H2170-P (parental) cells and the TKI resistant H2170-ER (erlotinib resistant) and H2170-SR (SU11274 resistant) cells. We aim to study EMT and determine if inhibition of -Catenin, a key regulator of transcription by siRNA or inhibition of ZEB-1 a transcriptional repressor of cell adhesion proteins by inducing mir-200a will help overcome the TKI resistance in NSCLC cells.Using immunoblotting, we observed modulations in key EMT-related proteins in H2170-ER cells which showed upregulation of ZEB-1, N-cadherin, active beta-catenin, Vimentin, PRMT1 and ZO1 by 1.8, 2.4, 2, 1.8, 2.6 and 2 fold, respectively, and downregulation of E-cadherin (1.8 fold) as compared to H2170-P cells. Similar results were observed for H2170-SR cells. These results were verified using qPCR where we show that -catenin (3.4-3.2 fold) and N-cadherin (2-1.9 fold) have increased gene expression while E-cadherin (1.7-2.4 fold) has a decreased gene expression in TKI resistant H2170-ER and SR cells when compared to H2170-P cells. miR-200a induction in H2170-ER cells showed significant downregulation of ZEB-1 (3 fold) at 72 hr and an upregulation of E-cadherin (2 fold) when compared to the mock transfected cells. Morphological changes indicative of EMT were detected using immunofluorescence with Vimentin and E-Cadherin antibodies, which displayed upregulation of Vimentin filaments (2 fold) and downregulation of E-Cadherin (3 fold) in H2170-ER and H2170-SR cells when compared to H2170-P cells. We then conducted experiments where we suppressed ZEB-1 by inducing miR-200a in TKI resistant cells. The immunoblotting results suggested recovery of E-Cadherin, and downregulation of ZEB-1 and N-Cadherin in TKI resistant cells. We also observed increased sensitivity towards erlotinib and SU11274 by 20-25%. Additionally, we observed decrease in levels of -Catenin and upon siRNA knockdown of -Catenin, suppression of levels of ZEB-1. This indicates a direct correlation between nuclear accumulation of -Catenin and occurrence of EMT in TKI resistant cells by increase in expression of ZEB-1.Our results indicate that increased activation of Wnt/-Catenin pathway in the TKI resistant NSCLC cells is due to the EMT. In NSCLC patients, L858R and T790M mutations are associated with TKI resistance which could be responsible for inducing EMT. We are further studying cell lines with EGFR mutations to determine their role in induction of EMT this may provide clinicians with novel targets to overcome TKI resistance in NSCLC patients.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' LDK378 is a novel, potent and selective small molecule anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor (IC50 0.00015 M), that does not inhibit c-MET (IC50 3.2 M). Tumor regression has been observed in ALK-driven NSCLC xenografts. A first-in-human, Phase I study is being conducted to determine the MTD and safety profile in patients (pts) with tumors with ALK rearrangement, amplification or mutation. Other objectives were safety, PK and antitumor activity in pts with ALK-driven NSCLC, both nave to ALK inhibitors and relapsed following previous ALK inhibitor treatment, and other ALK-positive cancers. Methods', ' Adult pts with advanced malignancies harboring a genetic alteration in ALK who progressed on standard therapy or for whom there was no effective therapy, were given once daily oral LDK378 on a continuous 21-day schedule. Dose escalation, starting at 50 mg/day, was guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) to determine the MTD. Results', ' At a January 5th 2012 cutoff,31 pts (primary site', ' lung 26 pts; breast 3 pts; other 2 pts; median age 52 years; 87% ECOG PS 0/1) were enrolled and received LDK378 at doses of 50750 mg/day. Two dose limiting toxicities, Grade (Gr) 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation (1 pt), and Gr 3 hypophosphatemia (1 pt) occurred in 8 pts at a 400 mg dose level. BLRM allowed dose escalation, and there were no DLTs in 4 pts at 500 mg. Median duration of treatment with LDK378 was 7 weeks (range <122+). At the cutoff date, 13 (42%) pts discontinued treatment', ' 1 (3%) due to adverse events (AEs), and 12 (39%) due to disease progression; 18 (58%) pts were still on treatment. The most frequent AEs (all Gr) were nausea (45%), vomiting (36%), and diarrhea (29%). The most frequent Gr 3/4 AEs were diarrhea and dyspnea (2 pts [7%] each). At doses 400 mg steady state exposures exceeded efficacious exposures in xenograft models. Of 16 pts with available response data (RECIST, per investigator) there were 4/6 responses in crizotinib (CRZ)-treated pts, and 2/10 responses in CRZ-nave pts, of whom 7 were treated below 400 mg. All responses were in NSCLC. Conclusions', ' Daily oral LDK378 is well tolerated up to 500 mg/day, and escalation continues at 750 mg/day. Preliminary responses have been seen in both CRZ-nave and CRZ-relapsed pts.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Targeting MET in preclinical models to support the clinical development of Volitinib in NSCLC",
        "Background":"['MET is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is deregulated (gene amplification, mutation and over-expression) across multiple cancer types. Signaling through MET is normally activated through interactions with its specific ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Aberrant MET/HGF activation can stimulate tumor growth, promote angiogenesis, induce metastasis and may contribute to resistance mechanisms in several tumor types. Several non-selective MET inhibitors have entered clinical development; results have been mixed based on potency, selectivity, and/or patient selection. Volitinib is a potent (IC50 4 nM) and selective (>650 fold selectivity over 265 kinases), small molecule inhibitor of MET. Recent evaluation of Volitinib across a panel of cancer cell lines demonstrated selectivity for MET-driven disease, with MET amplified cell lines being most sensitive (IC50s of 1nM) and also suggesting limited off target activity. Volitinib resistant cell lines with MET amplification were identified and used to better understand the relationship of concurrent mutations with response. In addition to cancer cell line selectivity, we are analyzing preclinical models of NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) that are representative of key patient segments, namely MET amplification and over expression. In newly diagnosed NSCLC adenocarcinomas, focal MET amplification events represent 3% of the population while over expression of MET (without gene amplification) is observed in the majority of patients. In preclinical models, focal Met amplification in EBC-1 and NCI-H1993 caused significant tumor growth inhibition, confirming sensitivity to Volitinib. Given the prevalence of over expression in NSCLC, however, we sought to build a platform of evidence for the therapeutic use of Volitinib in preclinical models lacking amplification of the MET gene. Using a patient-derived xenograft model (PDX) of EGFR WT, KRAS WT and metastatic NSCLC disease (HLXF-036LN), we demonstrate that Volitinib induces tumor regression as monotherapy and has added therapeutic benefit when used in combination with taxotere. In addition, we show robust efficacy effects for additional preclinical models, LG0567, LG0645 and Calu-3, for either Volitinib alone or in combination with taxotere. In parallel pharmacodynamic studies, we demonstrate that Volitinib inhibits p-MET and downstream signaling in each model. Together, using an integrated platform of molecular characterization and MET FISH and IHC scores, corresponding antitumor responses to Volitinib are being evaluated for several patient segments. We are using these studies to inform the design of patient selection criteria for upcoming clinical trials in NSCLC.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Efficacy of MET inhibitors in NSCLC with CBL alterations",
        "Background":"['Purpose/Objective(s)', ' Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule that is important in cancer. It belongs in the family with CBL-B and CBL-3. Our previous studies detected CBL mutations, loss of heterozygosity, and low protein expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We also determined the genetic variations of CBL, their relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as EGFR and MET, and their functionality in NSCLC. However, ubiquitination of EGFR showed no difference between CBL wild type (WT) and mutants (Mts). Therefore, we undertook to investigate whether MET is a potential target of CBL and better therapeutic strategy.Materials/ Methods', ' CBL alterations were determined in NSCLC patients with next generation sequencing. Immunoprecipitation was performed to detect the ubiquitination of MET by CBL WT and Mts. MET inhibitor SU11274 was utilized to compare cell viability of CBL WT cells with viability of CBL Mt cells. Cell motility after SU11274 treatment was examined by wound healing assay. Soft agar assay was performed to investigate colony formation of shRNA knockdown (sh-CBL) cells and SU11274 treatment. PamGene Chip analysis was used to detect and predict the RTK phosphorylation difference between CBL WT and Mt/sh-CBL cells. In vivo mouse study was performed to examine tumor growth and metastasis of sh-CBL cells.Results', ' CBL had 6% (8/135) mutation rate in NSCLC patient population. When CBL and MET protein expression levels were analyzed by immunoblot, CBL WT cells had lower MET protein expression than CBL Mt cells. The ubiquitination of MET was decreased in cells that transiently expressed CBL Mt relative to CBL WT cells. In addition, CBL Mt cells were more sensitive to MET inhibitor SU11274 than CBL WT cells. Wound healing assay demonstrated sh-CBL cells had an increase in cell motility and more sensitive with SU11274 migration inhibition. Furthermore, soft agar assay showed an increase in colony number and size of sh-CBL cells compared to control cells. After treatment with SU11274, sh-CBL cells showed inhibition in colony formation. In vivo study showed sh-CBL cells had lower tumor growth but more metastasis than control cells. PamGene results predicted an effective cell signaling pathway involving MET, paxillin, EPHA2, and VEGFR..Conclusions', ' Ubiquitination assay result suggested MET is one of direct targets of CBL. The cell viability and motility results demonstrated that CBL mutants and sh-CBL cells are more sensitive than CBL WT cells to MET inhibitor SU11274, suggesting they have higher MET protein expression. Moreover, the PamGene results indicated that MET is involved in CBL cell signaling pathway. Thus, CBL gene status could be a potential indication for lung cancer therapy utilizing MET and other inhibitors.']",
