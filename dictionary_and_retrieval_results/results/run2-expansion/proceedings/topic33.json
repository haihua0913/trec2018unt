        "Meeting_name":" The role of autocrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in breast cancer metastasis",
        "Background":"['The majority of breast cancer deaths are due to the development of metastatic disease. The metastatic cascade consists of a series of steps and includes primary tumor growth and angiogenesis, invasion, intravasation, cell survival in circulation, extravasation and sustained growth at secondary organ sites to form micrometastases. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1; Her1) increases tumor cell motility, intravasation and motility. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the metastatic potential of cancer cells depends not only on their intrinsic characteristics but also on their cooperative interaction with the tumor microenvironment. For instance, imposed gradients of EGF or colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) can stimulate invasion via an EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop between tumor cells and macrophages. Because breast malignancies exhibiting increased expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of receptors and their cognate ligands are associated with more biologically aggressive disease and poorer patient prognosis, we decided to study how expression of certain members of the EGF family of ligands in the context of ErbB1 overexpression can affect the processes of invasion, intravasation and metastasis using in vitro and in vivo systems. Based on initial Oncomine cancer gene expression analysis, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) overexpression was correlated with more rapid recurrence of disease in breast cancer and thus, we decided to focus our study this ligand. Briefly, MTLn3 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells and human MDA-MB 231 breast adenocarcimona cells were transduced to overexpress HB-EGF. HB-EGF expression did not significantly affect in vitro or in vivo growth rate. In vitro microchemotaxis and invasion assays to study chemotaxis and invasion, respectively, in the presence and absence of EGF, demonstrated that random motility and spontaneous invasion were both enhanced in the presence of HB-EGF expression. Interestingly, EGF-induced chemotaxis and EGF-induced in vivo invasion were both suppressed. In vivo studies show that tumor cells expressing HB-EGF not only display increased metastasis to the lungs and extravasation from circulation, but also significantly enhanced macrophage recruitment and exerted an angiogenic effect. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the role of HB-EGF in breast cancer will aid in directing and modifying therapeutic approaches aimed at inactivating the ErbB ligand/EGFR system as well as developing approaches based on the EGF family of ligands as a target for the clinical treatment of breast cancer, ultimately leading to improved patient survival.']",

        "Background":"['Growth factor receptors of the ErbB family, especially ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB2 (HER2), have attracted considerable attention in recent years as therapeutic targets for the treatment of numerous malignancies including cancers of the lung, colon, and breast, either through blockade of the extracellular ligand binding site by monoclonal antibodies (e.g. anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, and anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab) or inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain by small molecule inhibitors (e.g. EGFR kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib, and dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib). The abundance of small molecule kinase inhibitors in clinical development or on the market attests to the acceptance of ErbB inhibition as a clinically relevant paradigm. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistance mechanisms in ErbB driven or dependent tumors indicates that continued research is required to discover more effective drugs. We previously reported the discovery of JNJ-28871063, a potent inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 kinases in vitro that also showed excellent antitumor efficacy in EGFR (A431 epidermoid carcinoma) and HER2 (N87 gastric carcinoma) overexpressing xenograft models and significant extension of survival in a mouse intracranial tumor model. This compound is a 4-amino-6-arylaminopyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde oxime, a monocyclic chemotype that mimics the traditional bicyclic quinazoline scaffold via an intramolecular hydrogen-bonded pseudocycle involving the adjacent 4-amino and 5-oximino groups. In this study, we present results of a structure-guided analog program designed to optimize in vitro kinase potency and in vivo antitumor efficacy of the pyrimidine-oximes. While substituents on the 6-arylamino group are critical for ErbB inhibitory potency and kinase selectivity, substitution on the oxime oxygen may be changed to modify physico-chemical properties and bioavailability. We will discuss structure-activity relationships for the 5-oximino and 6-arylamino groups as well as the important role played by O-aminoalkyl oxime substituents in improving in vivo activity.']",

P as a single agent is not associated with meaningful activity against NSCLC, though stable disease (SD) has been observed in a phase II study (Herbst et al. Clin Cancer Res 2007;13', '6175). Erlotinib (E) inhibits HER1 tyrosine kinase signalling and is widely registered for treatment of relapsed NSCLC. By inhibiting extracellular receptor dimerisation, as well as internal signal transduction through HER1, the combination of E and P would be expected to result in extensive blockade of HER signalling. Preclinical and initial response data seem to confirm this (Felip et al. ESMO 2008, abs 269P). Methods', ' 15 pts in 2 cohorts were treated in this Phase I, dose-escalating study. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction and the majority of treatment-related adverse events were CTC grade 1 or 2; full doses of each drug were recommended for further phase II evaluation. Potential biomarkers possibly associated with antitumour activity of P and E were measured in tumour tissue and evaluated against clinical disease status. Proteins of potential significance were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mRNA by reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR). The panel of biomarkers measured included HER1 (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), HER2 and HER3. Results', ' Progression-free survival and tumour response were evaluated in all 15 pts. There were 3 partial responses (20%), with 1 further pt experiencing SD of  6 months. 13 pts had tumour samples that were suitable for full quantification of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 by RT qPCR as well as other markers by IHC. Interestingly, higher levels of mRNA for some HER receptors, as well as IHC markers, may correlate with treatment response.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Tumor angiogenesis is an important component of cancer biology driven in part by the thesis that tumor vessel growth is a necessary requirement for tumor growth. Angiogenesis does not only depend on endothelial cell invasion and proliferation', ' it also requires pericyte coverage of vascular sprouts for vessel stabilization. These processes are coordinated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A significant portion of research on tumor angiogenesis has focused on VEGF and its blockage with the expectation that dramatic results would be demonstrated in cancer patients as previously documented in animal models. Vandetanib, also known as ZD6474, is an antagonist of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or HER1 or ErbB1). It is an orally bioavailable small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of multiple growth factors, and is now available in the US for the treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Methods', ' ZD 6474 monomer was purchased modified to add a fluorescent dye (6-FAM). Its coupled ZD 6474 dimer was also prepared using a PEG linker, similarly with FAM fluorescent dye. The two compounds were compared in a series of in vitro studies using human endothelial cell (HUVECs) and several cancer cell lines. We first looked at VEGFR binding affinity and specificity with cell uptake and blocking study. Then, the effects on cellular viability and angiogenesis were compared using with tubular formation of HUVECs in vitro, also matrigel plug assay, and bio-distribution test on VEGF over expressed U87 human glioma tumor model in vivo. Results', ' Imaging of ZD 6474 dimer showed much better binding and uptake in HUVECs and other VEGFR expressing cells than ZD 6474 monomer, including during systemic delivery to tumors. However, the therapeutic and anti-angiogenic effects were mixed, with most tests showing the dimer to have same or weaker effects than the monomer. Conclusion', ' This study provides a rational for the evaluation of dimeric ZD 6474 as a potential imaging agent. Paradoxically, it also demonstrates that the enhanced receptor binding achieved by multivalency does not always translate into enhanced therapeutic effectiveness.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Cellular expression of EGFR ligands is tightly regulated and is thought to be maintained by an autocrine signaling component in colorectal cancer cells. More importantly, the expression levels of individual ligands have gained recent interest since their expression of their mRNA was found to be linked to anti-EGFR therapy response. Since the expression of these ligands can be regulated by EGFR signaling elicited by EGF, we decided to investigate the contribution of MAPK as well as the PI3K axis, to EREG expression, in K-Ras wild-type colon cancer cells. Methods Colon cancer cells were used to interrogate EGFR downstream signaling. Several inhibitors targeting the ErbBs and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways were used to dissect the pathways downstream of EGFR maintaining ligand mRNA levels in the lim1215 colon cancer cell line. Additionally, we used ER and AR reporter assays to selectively evaluate involvement of the EGFR pathway in transcriptional regulation of the pathway. Consequently, blockade and activation of EGFR pathway members was assessed by Western Blot. Results We show that Ereg and Areg mRNA levels are specifically maintained by erbb1 signaling. Treatment of lim1215 cells with inhibitors blocking Erbb1 (cetuximab) or ErbB1/Erbb2 (lapatinib) did results in near complete inhibition of Ereg and Areg expression in Kras/pi3K wild-type cells, while blockade of ErbB2 alone (which is activated in these cells) with Trastuzumab did not decrease Ereg nor Areg mRNA levels. Downstream of EGFR, we show that MEK signaling is not required for maintenance of EREG and AREG levels in lim1215 cells. Conversely, blockade of PI3K signaling by Akt inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors abolished EREG mRNA levels in these cells. This was reflected by the ability of overexpressed Akt to induce EREG and AREG reporter activity in 293T cells. In contrast, this activation could be rescued by the addition of Akt and PI3K inhibitors, but not MEK inhibitors in cellular media. Conclusions In this work we show that PI3K signaling is required for the transcription of EGFR ligands in colon cancer cells. In this regard, this provides additional insights to the recent findings that link PI3K/Akt signaling to Receptor Tyrosine Kinase expression and activation in cancer cells. Therefore, a global understanding of the signaling networks that control ligand availability and receptor abundance will be crucial in combining ErbB pathway inhibitors in the treatment of kras wild-type colon cancers.']",

ErbB dimerization results in the phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues, activating diverse signaling pathways. These downstream pathways culminate in a variety of cellular responses, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and migration. In addition, interactions between ErbB receptors provide a mechanism for signal differentiation and amplification. Dysregulation of ErbB mediated signaling confers a growth advantage, and can result in cellular transformation and/or increased tumor metastatic potential. ErbB family members have been well validated cancer targets. Both antibodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting individual ErbB receptors or both ErbB1/ErbB2 together have been approved for the treatment of human cancers. In addition, some ErbB targeting agents are in late stages of clinical testing.A large fraction of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, the most common and malignant primary brain tumor) harbors EGFRvIII activating mutation, and may represent an especially appropriate subgroup of this cancer for treatment with ErbB inhibitors.Results', ' NT113 is a potent and selective pan-ErbB family kinase inhibitor. It also inhibits known mutant EGFRs resistant to first generation EGFR inhibitors, including the T790M gate keeper mutant. NT113 inhibited proliferation of ErbB kinase driven cell lines, and GBM cell lines harboring EGFRvIII mutations.NT113 showed excellent oral PK in mouse and rat. rat, iv CL = 6.3 L/h/Kg, oral t1/2 = 15 h, F = 70%; mouse iv CL = 1.4 L/h/Kg, oral t1/2 = 16h, F = 100%. Importantly, NT113 showed significant brain exposure in rat oral PK studies, with brain/plasma ratio > 4 at 2, 4 and 24 hr time points, while afatinib brain level was not detectable at all 3 time points. If these PK results are maintained in human patients, it may lead to significant clinical activity. Longer half life would allow the drug to better permeate into tumor, while the brain penetrance is favorable for insuring the clinical activity of NT113 for CNS cancer, as well as for brain metastasis of NSCLC and breast cancers.In vivo, NT113 displayed excellent activities in NT87 gastric cancer xenograft models, and in NCI-H1975 (T790M gate keeper mutation) NSCLC xenograft models.

Extensive crosstalk seen among these receptors implies that blocking signaling of more than one receptor may be more effective in inhibiting tumor growth and circumventing resistance mechanisms than targeting individual receptors. In particular, HER3 is considered a key mediator of resistance to many targeted agents. We generated a two-in-one antibody, MEHD7945A, that binds to EGFR and HER3 with high affinity, inhibits receptor function and is more broadly efficacious in various tumor types when compared to monospecific anti-EGFR or anti-HER3 antibodies. Given the ability of HER3 to potently activate the PI3K survival pathway, we investigated if antagonizing ligand-dependent HER signaling with MEHD7945A in the presence of chemotherapy augments cytotoxicity. We calculated combination index values the effects of combining MEHD7945A with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in NSCLC and colorectal cell lines in vitro and in vivo. The NSCLC lines NCI-H292, NCI-H1666, NCI-H358 and HCC827 were treated with MEHD7945A plus gemcitabine over a wide range of drug concentrations.

        "Background":"['The high molecular weight, transmembrane mucin, MUC1 is expressed at high levels in many epithelial tumors including endometrial and pancreatic cancers. Aberrant glcosylation and overexpression of MUC1 make tumor cells poorly adherent, protect tumor cells from the host immune system, promote metastases from primary sites and enhance resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. MUC1 has three distinct domains', ' an extracellular domain (ECD) composed of a tandem repeat region rich in serine, threonine and proline; a transmembrane domain (TM) and; a short cytoplasmic tail domain (CT) involved in a variety of signal transduction events. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/erbB) family members regulate cell growth and survival in both normal and cancer cells. MUC1 interacts with erbB receptors and also affects downstream signaling pathways in a EGFR-ligand dependent manner. We previously demonstrated that the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor  (PPAR) agonist rosiglitazone severely inhibits progesterone stimulated MUC1 expression (Wang et al. 2010. Mol. Endocrinol. 24', ' 1368-1379). Two independent approaches were used to determine if rosiglitazone as well as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478 reduced MUC1 expression in a high MUC1-expressing cell line, HES; the uterine adenocarcinoma cell line, HEC-1A; and in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, HPAFII and CAPAN2. EGFR activation by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulated MUC1 protein expression (1.5-2 fold) in both uterine and pancreatic cancer cells. The PPAR agonist, rosiglitatzone, markedly (> 90%) reduced EGFR-driven MUC1 expression detected by antibodies directed against the MUC1 ECD and CT. Preliminary studies indicate that rosiglitazone effects on EGFR-driven MUC1 expression is indirect. Furthermore, rosiglitazone treatments enhanced EGFR degradation via the lysosomal degradation pathway in the presence of EGF-family ligands in both uterine and pancreatic cancer cell lines. A combination of biochemical and molecular biological assays have been used to identify the transcriptional and signal transduction pathways activated by EGFR, leading to increased MUC1 expression and the impact of AG1478 and rosiglitazone on these events. Understanding the molecular basis of how these agents reduce MUC1 expression may offer novel therapeutic avenues to improve cancer chemotherapies.']",

Importantly, though, these therapeutics only target either a single receptor or the kinase domain alone. It is well known that these receptors function as heterodimers, and blocking of a single receptor will only promote the hetero-dimerization of the remaining family members. Furthermore, while the tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors is well known, less appreciated are the kinase-independent mechanisms by which they drive cancer progression. These include the modulation of calcium signaling and mitochondrial and nuclear translocation and activity as transcriptional co-factors. The highly conserved juxta-membrane domain (JD) of the ErbB receptors regulates these kinase-independent functions, as well as receptor homo- and hetero-dimerization. Upon ligand binding, the JD forms anti-parallel dimers between the receptors, resulting in receptor dimerization and intracellular trafficking. These protein-protein interactions result in cell growth, survival, migration and invasion.']",

        "Background":"['Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is the most abundant cellular chaperone and has nearly 100 pivotal client proteins, which are commonly dysregulated in cancers. The positive rate of Hsp90beta in gastric cancer (GC) tissue was approximately 30%, and was higher than non-cancerous gastric mucosa. Hsp90 inhibitors should have great potentials in the exploration for treatment strategy in gastric cancer (GC). NYP-AUY922-AG (AUY922), kindly provided by Novartis Pharma AG, is a novel resorcinylic isoxazole amide Hsp90 inhibitor. Using 72-hour MTT colorimetric assay, we have demonstrated that AUY922 has highly active growth inhibitory effects as a single agent of IC50 in the nanomolar ranges between 8.1  0.2 and 14.7  0.8 nM in the gastric cancer cell line panels (except c-met-overexpressing KATO-III cells with a IC50 of 158.1  5.1 nM). In the gastric cancer MKN45 xenograft model, MKN45 cells (2  106) were injected subcutaneously in 100 l of Matrigel/Hanks balanced salt solution to the flank of nude mice. AUY922 50 mg/kgw and 100 mg/kgw intraperitoneal weekly injection (i.p.) were used. Tumor inhibitory effects of AUY922 in the MKN45 human gastric cancer xenograft model were statistically evident in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Several important growth factor receptors are overexpressed in GC, namely EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor, HER1), HER-2/neu, and c-met (hepatocyte growth factor receptor, HGF receptor), etc. By immunohistochemical staining of xenograft tumor tissues using specific antibodies, AUY922 100 mg/kgw i.p. weekly significantly down regulates multiple growth factor receptors and oncoproteins, including c-met, HER-2/neu, IGF1-R, EGFR, Akt, and notably thymidylate synthase (TS), etc. While the effects of AUY922 50 mg/kgw are less statistically significant. Up to date, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or oral fluoropyrimidines are the current mainstay agents for first-line treatment in gastric cancer. By combining AUY922 100 mg/kgw i.p. and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 40 mg/kgw i.p. weekly (wk), tumor inhibitory effects of AUY922 and 5-FU were synergistically effective. Combining AUY922 50 mg/kgw or 100 mg/kgw i.p. weekly and other relevant chemotherapeutic agents has been also actively exploring. Our data indicate that AUY922 plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) inhibits tumors synergistically in gastric cancer MKN45 xenograft via down regulation of multiple pivotal growth factor receptors and oncoproteins. Since phase I study of AUY922 has been completed with favorable toxicity profiles, it is highly reasonable to combine AUY922 with 5-FU or other relevant chemotherapeutic agents in future development of clinical trials for gastric cancers.']",

        "Background":"['The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ERBB family of oncoproteins which consist of four related receptors', ' EGFR/ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4. Overexpression of EGFR and other members of ERBB family were found to induce erroneous development and unrestricted proliferation in human malignancies including breast cancer. Neuregulins (NRG) are signaling proteins that produce cell-cell interactions and can bind to the extracellular domain of ErbB3 or ErbB4, activating signaling pathways leading to cellular responses that include stimulation or inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis, and gene regulation. Previous studies showed that constitutive expression of neuregulin 1-beta (NRG-1) in MCF-7 cells decreased the levels of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), which may contribute to the transformation from estrogen-responsive into a hormone-independent phenotype. An inverse correlation between expression of ER and EGFR has been demonstrated. Our hypothesis is that EGFR levels are regulated by neuregulins in breast cancer cell lines. We treated the breast cancer cell lines ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 with NRG-1 or NRG-1 at different concentrations for 4 hours. In addition, both cells lines were treated with selected concentrations of NRG-1 or NRG-1 at different time points. Isolated mRNA was used to measure EGFR expression using reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR and levels of protein were determined by western blot analysis. Our results show that EGFR mRNA levels increased when ZR-75-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of neuregulins. In this regard, treatment with 100 ng/mL of NRG-1 increased EGFR expression by 10-fold in ZR-75-1 cells. However, when MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with NRG-1 or NRG-1, the expression of EGFR mRNA levels did not change. Western blots analysis of ZR-75-1 cells treated with NRG-1 shows activated ErbB3, confirming that this activation is related to the increase in EGFR mRNA levels. Our data suggest a role for neuregulins in the EGFR up-regulation. One of the mechanisms related to ErbB3 activation is the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), thus current efforts are directed towards elucidating the role of these pathways in the NRG-upregulation of EGFR.

        "Background":"['The aberrant expression and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (also called HER or erbB family) have been implicated in a wide range of cancers. These receptors have emerged as important therapeutic targets in human cancers. To date, of the two classes of HER inhibitors (i.e. monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), cetuximab and panitumumab have been approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. However, many patients develop resistance to the EGFR inhibitors and consequently the duration of response to these treatments is often short. In this study on colorectal cancer cells, we evaluated whether there was any association between the expression levels of the HER family members, putative colorectal cancer stem cell (CSC) markers CD133 and CD44, and ABC transporter and the development of resistance to anti-EGFR mAb ICR62 or afatinib, an irreversible erbB blocker. A wide range of techniques were employed in this study including FACS analysis, Western blot analysis and SRB assay on the EGFR over-expressing human colorectal tumour cell line DiFi, which is highly sensitive to treatment with mAb ICR62 (IC50=1.2 nM) and afatinib (IC50=10 nM). Continuous exposure of DiFi cells to increasing doses of mAb ICR62 or afatinib for 6-10 months resulted in the emergence of ICR62 variant DiFi cells (DiFi62) and afatinib-variant DiFi cells (DiFiAf) with IC50 values of 209 nM and 35 nM respectively. Interestingly, we found that ICR62 resistant DiFi cells (DiFi62) also become less sensitive to treatment with 5FU, oxaloplatin and irinotecan, but remained highly sensitive to treatment with afatinib (IC50=8 nM). In contrast to DiFi62 cells, afatinib-resistant DiFiAf cells were less sensitive to treatment with 5FU and irinotecan, but like parental DiFi cells remained highly sensitive to treatment with ICR62 and oxaliplatin. Of the HER family members, there was only upregulation of EGFR in both DiFi62 and DiFiAf cells, but no changes in the expression levels of other members of the HER family or CD133. In contrast, the expression of CD44, the other putative colorectal CSC marker, was found to be downregulated by around 38% in DiFiAf cells. Of the ABC transporters, there was an increase in the expression of p-glycoprotein in both DiFi62 and DiFiAf cells and an increased expression of both MRP2 and ABCG2 in DiFi62, but not in DiFiAf cells. Taken together, our results suggest that colorectal tumour cells which acquire resistance to anti-EGFR mAb ICR62 remain sensitive to treatment with the irreversible erbB blocker afatinib and vice versa, suggesting that mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of ICR62 and afatinib are different in these cells. In addition, upregulation of the EGFR upon treatment with these inhibitors may contribute to resistance.']",

        "Background":"['When combined with standard of care treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), the use of monoclonal antibodies or small molecule inhibitors against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) show modest efficacy in the clinic. Early detection efforts and more effective therapies have reduced mortality, yet CRC remains the second mostly deadly cancer in the United States with approximately 50,000 deaths expected this year. Thus, it is imperative to better understand the mechanisms governing molecular progression of CRC. Primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies occurs in approximately 80% of the patients with CRC. Mutations in Kras explain some non-responding CRCs, but even in cancers lacking Kras mutations, little is known about which cancers are likely to respond to EGFR targeted treatment, suggesting an alternative and EGFR-independent CRC progression mechanism. In this study, we used a conditional Egfr allele (Egfrf) within the ApcMin/+ mouse model and identified EGFR-independent tumors with faster growth rates than those developing in EGFR-wild type mice. To assess aggressiveness of EGFR-independent tumors, we used a metastatic CRC mouse model containing conditionally inactivated Apc alleles (Apcf/f) in combination with a conditionally active allele of Kras (KrasLSL-G12D). It has been reported that delivery of Cre recombinase-expressing adenovirus to the distal colon of these mice results in tumors that progress to carcinoma within 20 weeks, and liver metastases develop in approximately 20% of mice at 24 weeks. We discovered a 10% increase in the penetrance of tumors arising in the absence of EGFR (Egfrf/f, Apcf/f, KrasLSL-G12D/+). Endoscopic analysis suggests an increase in tumor multiplicity in EGFR-deficient tumors when compared with tumors developing in EGFR-wild-type mice. Biweekly colonoscopies confirmed that colonic tumors have a faster growth rate in the absence of EGFR. High-frequency abdominal ultrasound suggests liver metastasis at 16 weeks in 20% of mice lacking EGFR. These findings demonstrate the existence of an EGFR-independent mechanism by which CRC can arise and progress. Moreover, tumors lacking EGFR grow larger than those developing under normal EGFR activity and may be a more aggressive form of CRC. We also have evidence that ERBB3 and ERBB4, related EGFRs, mediate compensatory and alternative pathways, suggesting an important role for these receptors in the progression of EGFR-independent CRC. This study will advance our understanding of ERBB family biology during colonic tumorigenesis, ultimately contributing to better therapies for CRC.']",

Heterodimerization of ErbB1/EGFR, ErbB2/HER2, and ErbB3/HER3 drives aggressive tumor growth through hyperactivation of cancer cell survival and growth signaling pathways. The increased protein production required to sustain these activities renders cancer cells acutely dependent on support factors, such as chaperones and scaffolds, that maintain protein homeostasis. ErbB receptors are integral membrane proteins and as such are synthesized in and transported through the secretory pathway, which comprises the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and associated compartments and vesicles. Nascent ErbB receptors are stabilized and chaperoned through this pathway, in part, by heat shock protein 90 family members, HSP90 and GRP94. Sigma1 (also known as sigma1 receptor) is a unique integral membrane protein found primarily in the ER. Emerging lines of evidence suggest that Sigma1 may function as a chaperone or possibly a scaffolding protein. We find that the levels of Sigma1 protein are elevated and aberrantly distributed in HER2-amplified breast tumor biopsies compared to benign breast tissue. These data indicate that the status and potentially the physiological role of Sigma1 are altered in malignancy and that Sigma1 may be a valid drug target in the treatment of HER2-driven breast cancers. Previously, we discovered that certain selective small molecule modulators of Sigma1 could be used to induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy in a panel of cancer cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that these responses to Sigma1 modulators can be exploited to alter the trafficking, stability, and thus signaling of ErbB receptors in cancer cells. In vivo, Sigma1 modulators suppress the growth of xenografted HER2-amplified breast tumors. In the tumors, as well as in vitro cell culture, ErbB1-3 all are eliminated in response to treatment with prototypic small molecule Sigma1 modulators. This corresponds with suppression of downstream PI3K/Akt signaling and with induction of UPR and autophagy. Using high resolution microscopy and organelle fractionation techniques, we confirmed that the Sigma1 modulators induce cytoplasmic sequestration and subsequent degradation of ErbB receptors in ubiquitin-enriched autophagosomes. This process is blocked by cotreatment with autolysosome inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, suggesting that autophagy is the primary mechanism of Sigma1 modulator induced ErbB receptor degradation. Altogether, these data suggest that Sigma1 is a unique, ligand-operated scaffolding protein that contributes to the trafficking and stability of ErbB receptors in HER2-driven cancer cells. Furthermore, these data suggest that Sigma1 is a druggable component of the protein homeostasis regulatory apparatus of cancer cells.']",

The first three mechanisms lead to inhibition of HER3 phosphorylation and downstream signaling thereby resulting in tumor cell growth inhibition, while ADCC is a mechanism of direct target cell killing triggered by cross-linking of Fc receptors on immune effector cells (e.g. NK cells, macrophages).RG7116 is a novel humanized and glycoengineered IgG1 antibody currently in clinical development, that binds to HER3 with high affinity.

Elevated EGFR levels have primarily been attributed to enhanced transcriptional activity, rather than amplification of the gene. Since the EGFR intron 1 polymorphic CA dinucleotide repeats has been suggested to affect EGFR transcription efficiency, the present study was designed to explore the relationship between this CA repeats polymorphism, gene copy number and protein levels in Taiwanese OSCC. A total of 194 OSCCs were examined for EGFR protein overexpression using immunohistochemistry and for copy number using a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. DNAs from peripheral blood of 164 OSCC patients were also available for EGFR intron 1 CA dinucleotide repeats analysis. Overexpression and increased gene copy numbers of EGFR were found in 101 (52.06%) and 59 (30.41%) cases, respectively. The length of EGFR CA repeats were not associated with EGFR protein expression (p = 0.261) while the copy number was strongly related to protein overexpression (p < 0.001). EGFR protein overexpression was associated with young age (p = 0.036), tumor differentiation (p < 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.028).

Patients with CA repeats SS form (both alleles < 19 repeats) had significantly shorter DFS and OS than those with SL and LL forms (both alleles  19 repeats) (p = 0.039 and 0.018 for DFS and OS, respectively). On the other hand, the association between an increase in EGFR gene copies and DFS or OS was insignificant. In summary, our current findings confirm that EGFR protein overexpression is closely related to EGFR copy number; but, do not support the role of CA repeats as an EGFR expression regulator.

        "Background":"['Targeted therapies have changed the treatment paradigm of cancer. Specifically, the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved therapeutic responses in a number of tumor types. However, initial response to TKIs is often followed by rapid relapse due to the acquisition of molecular features that lead to resistance. ERBB3, a receptor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1) family, has been linked to the development of resistance to multiple ERBB targeting TKIs. A proposed potential mechanism is the recruitment and activation of ERBB3 as a bypass mechanism to activate PI3K dependent pro-survival pathways. We investigated whether the inhibition of ERBB3 could reverse TKI resistance linked to ERBB3 activation. AV-203 is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed against ERBB3. AV-203 potently inhibits both ligand dependent and ligand independent activation of ERBB3. AV-203 was shown to inhibit the binding of NRG1 to ERBB3 and promote ERBB3 degradation. The tumor growth inhibitory activity of AV-203 was demonstrated in numerous xenograft models representing major human carcinomas (breast, lung, ovarian, kidney and pancreas). Here, we investigated the ability of AV-203 to restore TKI sensitivity in models with activated ERBB3. First, we demonstrated that ligand mediated (NRG1) activation of ERBB3 leads to acquired resistance to the EGFR TKI erlotinib in a lung cancer model bearing EGFR TKI sensitizing mutation, to the ERBB2/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib in a HER2 amplified breast cancer model, and to the EGFR inhibitory antibody cetuximab in head and neck cancer models. AV-203 was able to restore sensitivity to these RTK inhibitors. This data suggest that the combination of AV-203, with EGFR/HER2 targeted therapies could potentially extend the efficacy of these agents by preventing the emergence of ERBB3 mediated resistance. This hypothesis will be tested in future clinical trials. AV-203 is currently in Phase I development for the treatment of solid tumors.']",

RANK receptor (Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor-kB) is a tumor necrosis superfamily member and binding partner for RANKL, which was recently implicated in breast cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. Here we provide preliminary evidence of a possible interplay between RANK and EGFR signaling in breast cancer. Methods', ' TCGA (cancergenome.nih.gov) publicly available mRNA and protein expression data (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) for EGFR and TNFSRF11A (RANK) genes from an unselected cohort of 1036 breast cancer patients and 58 breast cancer cell lines were retrieved and analyzed. EGFR and TNFSRF11A mRNA expression were also evaluated through real-time RT-PCR in a panel of 7 human breast cancer cell lines and 22 FFPE breast cancer samples. Plasmid transfections and western blots were performed to evaluate EGFR and RANK downstream signaling after EGF stimulation. Results', ' Between the four family members of ErbB (EGFR, ERBB2/3/4) receptors, RANK mRNA showed a statistically significant positive correlation (p< 0.001) with the mRNA and protein expression of EGFR, but not with ERBB2/3/4.

The prognosis for HNSCC is relatively poor, with an overall 5-year survival around 60%, and the outlook worsens with increasing stage at diagnosis, which is problematic since about two-thirds of patients present with advanced stage disease. This underscores the urgent need for discovery, development and translation of novel biomarkers to facilitate early detection of HNSCC and bolster the chance for positive patient outcomes. Exosomes are nano-sized (40-150 nm) membrane-encapsulated vesicles that may offer a new avenue for discovery and development of novel HNSCC biomarkers. However, they are released by essentially all cells, both normal and malignant, into the extracellular space, resulting in a noisy environment in biofluids from the perspective of biomarker measurement. As such, a membrane-bound surface marker that allows for enrichment for cancer-derived exosomes in patient samples would provide a clear benefit. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which belongs to the ErbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases, localizes to the plasma membrane and is over-expressed in as much as 90% of HNSCC tumors. Therefore, we hypothesized that EGFR will be over-represented on membranes of HNSCC-derived exosomes and thus may offer utility as a surface marker for detection and/or enrichment. To test this, we cultured an HNSCC cell line that over-expresses EGFR (FaDu), EGFR-deficient SW620 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, and primary human oral epithelial cells pooled from 3 healthy donors. Cells were cultivated in supplier-recommended media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) that was super-depleted of exosomes via 18 hour ultracentrifugation at 100,000g and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 in 150 cm2 flasks with 25mL media.

Exosome isolates were whole-mounted on carbon grids, Immuno-Gold labeled with anti-EGFR, and imaged on a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (Immuno-EM); anti-nucleoporin 153 (NUP-153), which localizes to the nucleus, was used as a negative control. Immuno-EM images indicate abundant EGFR expression on exosomes secreted by FaDu HNSCC cells, but EGFR is not detectable on the exosomes secreted by the oral epithelial cells from healthy donors.

However despite the high response rates to these agents, acquired resistance to ALK TKI therapy remains a significant barrier to overcome in order to maximize therapeutic responses in patients with ALK+ lung cancer. In crizotinib-resistant tumors, EGFR activation has been demonstrated to mediate acquired resistance in several independent studies. The tumor suppressor gene product MIG-6 (encoded by ERFFI1) acts as a natural inhibitor of signaling through EGFR (ErbB1) and other ErbB family members. However, a role for MIG-6 in ALK+ lung cancer has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigated the regulation of human MIG-6 in ALK+ lung cancer cells.DESIGN', ' MIG-6 expression, protein interaction and phosphorylation status were evaluated in ALK+ lung cancer cell lines and human tumor samples. The impact of MIG-6 loss and gain of function on ErbB receptor activity and on cell proliferation/survival were determined in several models of TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant ALK+ lung cancer.RESULTS', ' MIG-6 protein level is regulated by EML4-ALK fusion protein at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Genetic or pharmacologic knock-down of ALK significantly reduced MIG-6 protein levels in ALK+/TKI sensitive cells. We established a novel interaction between MIG-6 and ALK fusion proteins (both EML4-ALK and other fusion partners), and this association was dependent on ALK kinase activity. MIG-6 can also be tyrosine-phosphorylated by EML4-ALK and be threonine-phosphorylated through EML4-ALK-dependent MAPK activation. The reduced MIG-6 protein level was accompanied by increased total and phosphorylated ErbB family members (EGFR, HER2, and HER3) in ALK+/TKI sensitive lung cancer cells. Consistent with this observation, MIG-6 protein level is also attenuated in ALK+/TKI resistant cells, following the decreased EML4-ALK activity, while EGFR signaling activity is remarkably up-regulated in these resistant cells. Crizotinib-resistant cells were re-sensitized upon exposure to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors in combination with crizotinib. In addition, MIG-6 reconstitution impeded the development of early adaptive resistance in crizotinib-sensitive cells and was also able to inhibit the proliferation of crizotinib-resistant cells.CONCLUSION', ' Our study presents an in-depth mechanistic understanding of how ErbB family members, such as EGFR, are up-regulated at the time of crizotinib resistance and provides insights into the early escape mechanisms tumor may have to evade ALK TKI therapy.']",

With an initial discovery rate of 30% of MI cases, it is clear that treatment of MI disease should be a priority. Currently radical cystectomy is used in MI cases with neoadjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (PBC) highly recommended in the literature. With 1% of MI BC patients receiving this neoadjuvant therapy, metastases are common and PBC is the current treatment for these patients. However, cisplatin resistance is common in patients with MI BC leading to an average survival of only 15 months with a 5 year survival of 20%. Increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and related receptors ErbB2 and ErbB3 in BC is well documented. These receptors control cell growth and survival and several EGFR ligands are present in normal human urine. Thus we hypothesized that these receptors may play a role in BC resistance to PBC. EGFR family inhibition (EGFRi) has been investigated in conjunction with PBC in clinical trials. However, these trials did not show and increased benefit due to many of these patients having previously failed PBC therapy, EGFR/ErbB status not being part of the inclusion criteria, and frequent resistance to EGFRi in this patient population.We wanted to determine a mechanism for cisplatin and EGFRi resistance with the hypothesis that this could lead to novel therapeutics for MI BC. The BC cell lines T24, TCCSUP, J82 and RT4 were assayed for cisplatin sensitivity by flow cytometry. The TCCSUP and J82 cells were deemed cisplatin sensitive due to increased apoptosis when treated with cisplatin. The T24 and RT4 cells showed no apoptosis increase and were deemed to be cisplatin resistant. MTT and clonogenic assay determined that cisplatin resistant cells were also resistant to EGFRi. Similarly, cisplatin sensitive cells were sensitive to EGFRi. Additionally, it was determined that treating all cell lines with cisplatin and dacomitinib had a synergistic effect on reducing cell proliferation. Activation of EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3 was assayed by western blotting. Cisplatin sensitive cells underwent EGFR driven ErbB activation while cisplatin resistant cells underwent ErbB3 driven ErbB activation. Additionally, activation of EGFR Y845, Y1045, and Y1068 was increased by cisplatin in resistant cells.These results indicate that EGFRi and cisplatin, while working in parallel pathways, can influence one another. EGFR binding may be a prognostic marker for response to EGFRi. If EGFR binds primarily with ErbB2, the cells would likely respond to EGFRi; but, if EGFR binds primarily with ErbB3, the cells would likely be EGFRi resistant. Activation of EGFR Y845 (a Src binding site) may determine the preferential ErbB binding. EGFR Y845 activation may be blocked by EGFRi thus abrogating the effect of cisplatin and returning the cells to a cisplatin sensitive state.']",

Various molecular and cellular abnormalities are found in NSCLC, and an established theme is the alteration of protein phosphotyrosine (pY), as exemplified by elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity recognized in a subset of NSCLC. In order to gain a broad perspective of pY-mediated signaling networks in NSCLC, mass spectrometry was used to analyze pY-containing peptides affinity purified from protease-digested xenograft tumors. Seventeen tumors representing the major NSCLC subtypes adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were characterized. The major classes of pY proteins detected were cytoskeletal, protein kinases, and adhesion proteins. Pathways and cellular functions enriched in the data set included focal adhesion, adherens junction, and ErbB signaling. Five receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were detected, with EGFR and EPHA2 most prevalent. Src-family kinases (YES, LYN, FRK and LCK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) comprised the majority of non-receptor tyrosine kinases measured. Analysis of individual pY sites on 14 tyrosine kinases indicates their activation by kinase domain activation loop phosphorylation, but also revealed additional pY sites suggestive of regulation by trafficking/endocytosis and inter- and intra-molecular protein-protein interactions involving, for example, SH2 and SH3 domains, and extra-kinase domain regions. Analysis of tumors based on protein-pY suggested subtypes distinguished by their activated tyrosine kinase networks. Genetic analysis of 3 tumors that displayed EGFR-associated phospho-proteome signatures confirmed that they carried either EGFR activating mutations (in two ADCs) or increased gene copy number (in one SCC). Western blot analysis of protein pY confirmed different patterns of cellular protein pY among the tumor phospho-types in agreement with the phospho-proteomic analysis. Quantification of kinase and substrate pY sites, according to their integrated extracted ion currents, revealed a set of phosphorylations that constituted a molecular signature that differentiated between the ADC and SCC subtypes.

The clinical successes of HER2 directed therapies are well known in breast cancer and more recently, in gastric cancer. However, resistance develops invariably and gastric cancer continues to be a largely unmet disease necessitating novel therapeutic interventions. Recent reports have highlighted HER3 as an emerging target as it is frequently overexpressed, mutated, preferentially dimerizes with HER2 to activate signaling and is induced as a result of de novo or acquired resistance to PI3K-AKT, MAPK and RTK pathway inhibitors. We explored the utility of an ADCC and CDC enhanced potent anti-HER3 therapeutic antibody (GSK2849330) as a single agent or in combination with a selective small molecule AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of gastric cancer.A panel of 15 HER3 mutant and 4 HER3 wildtype PDX models was screened in vivo for responses to GSK2849330 as measured by% tumor growth inhibition (%TGI). Several models were characterized for other molecular alterations (e.g. HER2, PTEN, HER3, etc.) and represented various subsets of gastric cancer. As a single agent administered at 25mg/kg IP BIW, GSK2849330 was modestly effective (TGI  50%) in 2/15 mutant and 2/4 wildtype models. While context is likely to matter to drive dependence on HER3, no obvious predictive markers were observed. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of combination therapy with an AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) administered at 60mg/kg PO QD in a HER3 wildtype, PTEN deficient model. This resulted in significant durable tumor growth inhibition (94% TGI) with improved survival and noticeable tumor regression in a few mice in the combination treatment group relative to either single agent groups. Tumor samples collected at the end of the study showed pronounced pharmacodynamic modulation of p-AKT and p-HER3, demonstrating on target activity of these agents.Taken together, our findings suggest that modest anti-tumor activity was elicited by GSK2849330 as monotherapy in select gastric PDX models with no clear associations between response and HER3 mutations or other known markers. However, robust durable activity was observed upon combination with GSK2110183. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence supporting the rational combination of a selective AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) and an anti-HER3 therapeutic antibody (GSK2849330), both of which are actively undergoing clinical trials and warrant further investigation in gastric cancer.']",

We developed a multiplexed single-cell protein detection assay for the C1 system that can isolate and process 96 individual cells in parallel. The assay uses oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies, which produce a detectable DNA amplicon only when they bind to the target protein. The resulting DNA amplicons are quantified by qPCR on the Biomark HD system. Data are analyzed using the Singular Analysis Toolset. A total of 50 antibody binders were developed for this assay to target proteins related to apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation, tumor suppressors, biomarkers, stem cells, growth factors and proteins associated with specific cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers. The assay can be performed in a 48-plex format, which yields over 4,600 datapoints in two days. Assay sensitivity and specificity were assessed using recombinant proteins and various cell lysates. To demonstrate the usefulness of this assay, we used it to profile the protein level changes in A431 cells treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib. EGFR is a member of ErbB family of type I tyrosine kinases, whose overexpression and mutations are involved in a variety of cancers. While much effort has been made to investigate the consequences of EGFR activation or inhibition, hardly any information is available regarding how EGFR regulation changes protein expression in single cells. Using a multiplexed protein assay, we discovered some interesting co-expression patterns of proteins in single cells. We also demonstrated that TNFRSF10B was upregulated, while MET, GATA3, BRCA1, CCNB1, Ki-67 and CCNA2 were downregulated by gefitinib treatment. Notably, the reduction of the cell cycle-related proteins CCNB1 and CCNA2 and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 was consistent with the inhibited cell growth by gefitinib.

        "Background":"['For women, breast cancer has the highest number of annual diagnoses and causes the second highest number of cancer related deaths per year. Receptor tyrosine kinases like those in the ErbB family play a crucial role in breast cancer progression by providing cancer cells proliferative and anti-apoptotic advantages. By targeting the ErbB family with monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors, the prognosis of patients has improved dramatically, but resistance to these therapies does occur which requires novel therapies to be developed. One promising approach to circumvent drug resistance and inhibit tumor growth is to interrupt the elements that regulate the ErbB family protein expression such as RNA processing. The RNA transcripts of the ErbB family members must be spliced to be functional due to their immense size and the number of introns in these genes. Therefore, any alteration to this process could adversely affect tumor cells. SON, a splicing cofactor, has emerged as a protein of interest in cancer research because of its ability to impact the cell cycle and apoptosis by aiding in pre-mRNA maturation. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that SON is required for ErbB family receptor-driven breast cancer by promoting the expression of not only the ErbB family proteins but also certain ErbB downstream effectors through enhanced RNA splicing. Our studies show that knocking down SON with two independent siRNAs significantly lowers the protein expression of ErbB family proteins ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3 in cancer cells. At the mRNA level, the functional ErbB2 and ErbB3 transcripts decrease because introns are inappropriately retained which causes RNA degradation. These changes lead to a decrease in proliferation and increased apoptosis in breast cancer cells. After examining multiple major signaling pathways with a phospho-kinase array, we found that the activation of several critical ErbB family receptor downstream cascades that respond to stress (p38/JNK) and ensure survival (Akt) are suppressed especially in cells that have high levels of ErbB2. Patient samples were also analyzed which showed that breast tumors tend to have higher levels of SON, and the five year survival for these patients is decreased. Taken together, these data indicate that we have discovered SON as a novel ErbB family receptor splicing factor that may play an important role in breast cancer progression. Our future studies will focus on investigating more in-depth mechanisms by which SON regulates the RNA splicing of the ErbB family and evaluating whether SON can serve as a therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment by using drug and in vivo studies.']",

Standard treatment options for this malignancy include resection and local radiation therapy, although chemotherapy is sometimes used to control metastatic or locally recurrent disease. Patients with ACC may survive for years due to latent tumor growth and lack of lymph node metastasis; however, the high rate of recurrence and metastasis to the lungs lead to a poor prognosis beyond ten years. While specific molecular abnormalities that underlie this disease process are unknown, improved understanding of ACC tumor biology and oncogenesis has provided some molecular targets for its treatment. Recently human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER) family members including EGFR (HER1) and HER2 have been found overexpressed in salivary gland carcinomas and HER2 has also a role in this type of cancer as in many cancer types. Dacomitinib is an orally available, highly selective irreversible small molecule inhibitor of the HER family of tyrosine kinases. Figitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). In a recent phase I trial, combination of these two agents resulted in partial tumor responses in two ACC patients as well as minor responses in other indications. To further examine the potential benefit of these agents in ACC, we evaluated single agent and combination activity of dacomitinib and figitumumab in five patient-derived preclinical ACC tumor models including ACCx5M1, ACCx6, ACCx9, ACCx14 and ACCx16. Endpoints for each study were a mean control tumor volume of approximately 1 cm3 or sixty-days following treatment initiation. In these studies dacomitinib and figitumumab were well tolerated at the evaluated treatment regimens. Modest activity was reported with dacomitinib alone which did not reach statistical significance. However, single agent figitumumab demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.05) tumor growth inhibition in two of five models and combination of dacomitinib and figitumumab was found active in three of five models. Partial tumor responses were reported in ACCx6 and ACCx14 studies with figitumumab and combination treatment, respectively and minor tumor regressions noted with combination treatment in ACCx5M1.

        "Background":"['Estrogen is an essential hormone for mammary gland development and is a key driver of proliferation during the development of estrogen receptor positive breast tumors. The actions of estrogen are primarily mediated by its receptor, the ER transcription factor, which regulates several hundred estrogen-responsive genes in breast cancer cells. However, despite much investigation, the identity of the key effectors of this proliferative signal in breast cancer remains unclear. Amphiregulin (AREG) is a ligand of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. It is transcriptionally regulated by estrogen and is required for estrogen-dependent mouse mammary gland development. In this study, we have tested whether Amphiregulin is a key effector of estrogen in breast cancer.shRNA-mediated knockdown of Amphiregulin in MCF7 cells strongly attenuated ER+ breast cancer cell line growth in vivo. Conversely, expression of Amphiregulin from an estrogen-insensitive promoter allowed MCF7 xenografts to escape the therapeutic effects of tamoxifen. Thus, Amphiregulin expression is both necessary and sufficient for the proliferative response to estrogen in MCF7 cells in vivo, and downregulation of Amphiregulin in response to tamoxifen is required for a therapeutic benefit.After initially responding to endocrine therapy, many ER+ tumors progress to resistance to these therapies. Our model predicts that breast tumors which either (1) express AREG in an estrogen-insensitive manner or (2) have elevated levels of alterative ERBB family ligands, will be endocrine resistant. We present experimental and clinical evidence demonstrating that these features contribute to at least some examples of endocrine resistance. Firstly, in MCF7 cells selected for resistance to fulvestrant, we show that AREG expression is no longer regulated by estrogen or its antagonists, but the cells remain AREG-dependent. Secondly, in a series of 52 ER+ breast cancer patients treated with neo-adjuvant letrozole, we show that the downregulation of Amphiregulin in response to endocrine therapy observed in our mouse studies is recapitulated in human breast cancer patients, and that tumors in which alternate ERBB ligands (TGFalpha, Epiregulin, and Neuregulins 1 & 2) are expressed at high levels are least likely to respond to letrozole.In summary, these data underline the importance of ERBB signaling in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and implicate Amphiregulin as the primary ERBB ligand in mediating the effects of estrogen in these tumors.']",

Sigma-2 Receptor/Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (S2R/Pgrmc1) is a cytochrome-related protein and it is upregulated in multiple types of cancer. S2R/Pgrmc1 binds to several proteins including epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and regulates the EGFR signaling in lung and breast cancer cells, as we previously showed. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), a member of EGFRs family, has been evaluated as a potential therapeutic target for GC due to an identified link between expression of HER2 and severity of GC. Several HER2 inhibitors are currently under investigation in Phase I and II clinical trials. Most of them inhibit ligand binding or kinase activity of HER2. Here, we suggest that HER2 is a novel molecular target of S2R/Pgrmc1, thus, inhibiting S2R/Pgrmc1 can be a potential therapeutic strategy for GC.Results', ' We found that the protein expression of S2R/Pgrmc1 is elevated in human gastric cancer tissue array and in multiple gastric cancer cell lines such as AGS, NCI-N87, and Hs 746T. Approximately 60% of GC cells have moderate to strong staining of S2R/Pgrmc1 as compared to weak staining noted in normal gastric cells, suggesting an association of S2R/Pgrmc1 with pathogenesis of GC. We also found that S2R/Pgrmc1 was inhibited by AG205, an inhibitor of PGRMC1, in concentration-dependent manner in NCI-N87 GC cell line. Consistently, AG205 inhibited proliferation of NCI-N87 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manner (p-value = 0.025).

The presence of ERBB3 correlates with local to distal metastasis in lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers as well as bone invasion in prostate cancer. Activation of ERBB3 is also implicated in the development of resistance to current cancer treatments. Due to its lack of kinase activity, the activation of the ERBB3 receptor is dependent on heterodimerization with active receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The recruitment of ERBB3 into active, heterodimer complexes is mediated by its ligand Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) or by amplified, over expressed RTKs in a ligand independent manner. Therefore, ERBB3 can crosstalk with most major receptors involved in cancer development and maintenance such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and c-MET. AV-203 is a potent, humanized anti-ERBB3 antibody that inhibits both ligand-dependent and independent activation of ERBB3 both in vitro and in vivo.

Collectively this family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play critical roles in the etiology of several human cancers as well as a role in resistance to radiation therapy. In 2006, a study in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) indicated that using the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in combination with radiation resulted in a 10% advantage of 3-year overall survival rate when compared to radiotherapy alone. This study highlighted the therapeutic utility of RTK blockade in combination with radiation. Studies investigating the role of HER3 in radiation response are limited. In the present study, we investigated whether or not HER3 blockade could enhance radiation therapy using the HER3 antibody U3-1287/AMG888. We screened a battery of cell lines from lung, HNSCC and colorectal tumor lines for HER3 expression. The results indicated that all 15 cell lines tested showed expression of HER3. In addition, U3-1287/AMG888 was able to block basal HER3 activity and radiation induced HER3 activation. Further, proliferation assays, using U3-1287/AMG888, indicated that HER3 blockade could block proliferation in SCC6, SCC1483, H226 cell lines, highlighting the importance of HER3 in these tumor cells. Clonogenic assays showed that U3-1287/AMG888 could sensitize these lines to radiation. Furthermore, -H2AX analyses, detected by immunofluorescence, lead to a statistically significant increase in apoptotic cells. Cell cycle analysis, 24 and 48 hours after U3-1287/AMG888 and radiation treatments resulted in a significant G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. Annexin-V binding assays showed a significant increase in apoptosis in the U3-1287/AMG888 plus radiation group as compared to either agent alone. To determine if HER3 blockade using U3-1287/AMG888 could enhance radiation therapy in vivo we performed tumor growth delay experiments using SCC6, SCC1483 and H226 xenografts in nude mice. Mice were inoculated and treated with 1) IgG, 2) U3-1287/AMG888, 3) radiation or 4) the combination. The results of these experiments indicated that the combination of U3-1287/AMG888 and radiation had a strong impact on tumor growth in studies using single dose or fractionated dosing. Tumor analysis indicated that radiation treatment activated HER3 in vivo and U3-1287/AMG888 could abrogate this activation. Collectively our findings in vitro and in vivo suggest that U3-1287/AMG888 in combination with radiation has an impact on cell and tumor growth by impacting cell cycle progression, increasing apoptosis and increasing DNA damage. These findings suggest that HER3 may play a critical role in response to radiation therapy and blocking its activity may be of strong therapeutic benefit in human tumors.']",

EPCs metastasize to regional lymph nodes in approx. 20% of cases with a mortality rate of 67%, due to subsequent distant metastasis. Whereas surgery is effective as first line treatment, optimal management of metastatic porocarcinoma has not yet been defined. Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or/and the downstream RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway may be a potential treatment for metastatic EPC since EGFR is expressed in more than 81% of skin adnexal tumors. Methods', ' Immunohistochemical analyses (IHC) of ten primary EPCs and of skin metastases derived from one patient with EPC were performed. EGFR and the downstream signal transduction molecules ERK, p-ERK, AKT and p-AKT were analysed. To study the in vitro effects of EGFR or/and MEK inhibition in EPC, we isolated tumor cells from a skin metastasis of a patient with EPC who was resistant to chemotherapy. Results', ' All primary tumors and metastases were highly positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor and positive for the signal transduction molecules ERK, p-ERK and AKT but negative for p-AKT. Isolated cutaneous metastatic EPC cells strongly expressed p-EGFR and p-ERK. Treatment of these cells with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab or the MEK inhibitor trametinib inhibited tumor growth and moderately induced apoptosis. Moreover, combined EGFR and MEK inhibition significantly enhanced the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. This patient underwent surgery for rapidly progressing skin and lymph node metastases and was treated with cetuximab. The patient remained progression-free for 6 months. Conclusions', ' These data suggest that EPC cells express high levels of EGFR that activates the MAPK pathway thus rendering tumor cells susceptible to EGFR or/and MEK inhibition.

Recently, clinical trials testing cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, with simultaneous radiation therapy have begun in this patient population. The discovery of Kristen-ras (KRAS) wild type status and EGFR gene mutation as markers of response to EGFR inhibitor monotherapy has allowed individualized cancer treatment in colorectal and lung cancer respectively. Neither of these markers is present in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the only tumor proven to be radiosensitized by Cetuximab.

Despite overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family - especially EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3 - in all stages of PCa progression, the dual-kinase EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor lapatinib (GW572016) failed in Phase 2 trials in hormone-nave and CRPC patients. Here, we investigated mechanisms of lapatinib resistance using the CWR22 (R22, hormone-nave) and CWR22-Rv1 (Rv1, CRPC) models of PCa progression.R22 or Rv1 tumors were implanted (s.c.) in male athymic nu/nu mice, castrated or left intact and treated daily with vehicle or 100mg/kg lapatinib (oral gavage). Tumors were collected at the studys end and analyzed (Western Blot/WB, immunohistochemistry/IHC).With Ki67 staining, compared to R22 tumors, Rv1 tumors were more proliferative and unaffected by castration or lapatinib. R22 tumors regressed after castration but not lapatinib. As in human patients, lapatinib resistance was observed in hormone-nave R22 and CRPC Rv1 tumors thus validating our experimental model.First we asked why Rv1 tumors proliferated rapidly. Rv1 tumors expressed 2-fold more ErbB3 than R22 tumors (WB). We previously showed that ErbB3 overexpression increased proliferation (Chen et al., Canc. Res, 70(14)', \"5994-6003, 2010) - hence we attribute the rapid growth of Rv1 tumors to high ErbB3. Castration reduced EGFR, phosphorylated Akt and Erk in R22 but not in Rv1 tumors - decreased activation of these kinases may mediate the effects of castration on tumor growth. Rv1 tumors expressed alternately-spliced variants of androgen receptor (AR) that cause castration-resistance and less PSA than R22 tumors.Next, we asked why EGFR/ErbB2 inhibition failed in Rv1 tumors, despite EGFR's prominence in this tumor type. Lapatinib reduced intratumoral PSA levels in intact R22 mice but increased it in Rv1 mice. Lapatinib also increased EGFR and phosphorylated Akt in intact Rv1 but not R22 tumors. We hypothesize that, in Rv1 tumors, increased EGFR induces Akt phosphorylation which, we have shown earlier, regulates AR transcriptional activity and increases PSA expression. In contrast, in castrated Rv1 mice, lapatinib also increased ErbB3 levels. In Rv1 tumors, castration increased nuclear ErbB3 whereas in R22 tumors it increased cytoplasmic ErbB3 (IHC).Our results indicate that lapatinib may have failed in castrated Rv1 mice due to increased overall ErbB3 but in castrated R22 tumors due to increased cytoplasmic ErbB3. Regardless, the result is heightened ErbB3-related activity, which may cause increased proliferation and eventual drug failure. A pan-ErbB drug which also inhibits ErbB3, e.g. dacomitinib, can successfully overcome EGFR/ErbB2 resistance, as demonstrated in vitro.\"]",

        "Background":"['The Mena protein has been shown to be critical for breast cancer metastasis, and, in pre-clinical models two of its isoforms MenaINV and Mena11a are expressed in invasive and non-invasive tumor cell subpopulations, respectively. We have previously developed a quantitative immunofluorescence approach to assess the fraction of Mena protein lacking Mena11a called Menacalc as a method to infer presence of invasive tumor cells. Menacalc is determined by subtracting the population-based Z-score (quantifies the relationship to the mean) for Mena11a quantitative expression score from the population-based Z-score for total Mena quantitative expression score. The resulting Menacalc scores range from -4 to +4 with high scores reflecting tumors with relatively high total Mena (all isoforms) but low Mena11a. We showed that high MENAcalc scores associated significantly with poor disease-specific survival in breast cancer patients, including node-negative and positive cases. A recent study reported that a semi-quantitative approached to Mena assessment shows prognostic value in early Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Bria et. al 2014). Here, we asked whether the quantitative Menacalc assay has prognostic value in NSCLC and if it can predict metastatic disease. We determined Menacalc on a cohort of 201 predominantly early-stage NSCLC cases using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (MQIF) and then assessed Menacalc with respect to clinical and pathological features, as well as disease-specific survival. There was no significant difference in Menacalc by stage, sex, or age. However, Menacalc was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in squamous cell carcinoma (N = 32) as compared to other histological subtypes. High levels of Menacalc were associated (10% significance level) with decrease 5-year disease specific survival in all patients [HR = 1.78 (95%CI', ' 0.92-3.43); P = 0.08], and were significantly associated with survival when either corrected for histological subtype [HR = 2.10 (95%CI', ' 1.04-4.26); P = 0.04] or in the squamous-only population [HR = 6.60 (95%CI', ' 1.22-53.75); P = 0.04]. There was no difference in survival as a function of stage nor in adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, consistent with Mena isoform status being associated with the metastatic phenotype, Menacalc was 2-fold higher (P = 0.09) in metastatic patients, but the sample size with available clinical data was limited (N = 9). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Menacalc has potential prognostic value especially in squamous cell carcinoma patients. These data also preliminarily suggest that Menacalc can predict the metastatic phenotype. Further studies examining Mena isoform expression in squamous and later-stage metastatic NSCLC patients is thus warranted and currently ongoing.']",

However, this therapy is often associated with high toxicity and resistance, suggesting that the concomitant use of novel compounds represents a critical strategy to improve treatment results. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) enhance the activity of several anticancer drugs including CDDP and anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) compounds. EGFR overexpression is involved in chemotherapy resistance and recently it has been demonstrated that EGFR nuclear localization represents one of the mechanism of resistance to both CDDP and CX. Our group have demonstrated that HDACi synergize with anti-EGFR agents by modulating ErbB receptors expression including EGFR. In this study we evaluated the capability of Valproic acid (VPA), a generic low-cost anticonvulsivant drug with HDACi activity, to enhance the efficacy of CDDP-CX association in SCCHN cells with different EGFR basal expression and genetic backgrounds. We showed, by the calculation of combination indexes, an antiproliferative synergistic interaction between equipotent doses of VPA and CDDP-CX in CAL27 and FaDu SCCHIN cells using either simultaneous or sequential (with 24 h delay) schedule of administration. Notably, this effect was not observed in immortalized human fibroblasts BJ-hTERT, suggesting a selective effect toward tumor cells. Next, we confirmed synergistic interaction by testing clinically achievable concentrations of VPA/ CDDP-CX combination also on CAL27 and FaDu 3D spheroid cultures, showing inhibition of first- and second-generation spheroids formation by triple combination, compared to single agent treatments. Moreover we demonstrated that VPA was able to down-regulate EGFR and to prevent EGFR nuclear translocation induced by CDDP and CCDDP/CX combination, thus preventing the activation of DNA repair and survival pathways. Indeed, we showed that VPA was able to increase DNA damage and apoptosis induced by CDDP-CX combination, evaluated by gamma H2AX foci and annexin V-FITC assay, respectively. In vivo preclinical study is currently ongoing. All together these data represent the rationale of the ongoing V-CHANCE phase-2 clinical trial evaluating VPA/ CDDP-CX combination in R/M SCCHN patients.

        "Background":"['HER3 is a member of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER) family. HER3 is a kinase dead receptor, but by forming heterodimers with other HER family receptors, HER3 works as amplifier for PI3 kinase driven tumorigenesis. It has been reported that tumors treated with EGFR-, HER2- or cMET-targeted therapies can escape via HER3 activation or upregulation. HER3 is expressed in a large variety of tumors for example in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. Anti-HER3 antibodies can work via various mechanisms including', \" (1) blocking ligand (HRGs) binding to the receptor, (2) blocking heterodimerization with other HER family members (HER1, 2 and 4), (3) downregulation of the receptor from the cell surface, and (4) engaging immune effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The first three mechanisms lead to inhibition of HER3 phosphorylation and downstream signaling thereby resulting in tumor cell growth inhibition, while ADCC is a mechanism of direct target cell killing triggered by cross-linking of Fc receptors on immune effector cells (e.g. NK cells, macrophages). GE-huMab-HER3 is a novel humanized and glycoengineered IgG1 antibody that binds to HER3 with high affinity. This antibody prevents ligand binding and receptor heterodimerization thereby blocking receptor phosphorylation. In various tumor xenograft models treatment with this antibody leads to substantial tumor growth inhibition. E.g. GE-huMab-HER3 treatment achieved >50% tumor growth inhibition in 10 out of 17 NSCLC models and in some cases even resulted in complete tumor remission. However, these xenograft experiments only reveal part of this antibody's therapeutic potential. A unique feature of GE-huMab-HER3 that differentiates it from other anti-HER3 antibodies, including AMG 888 and MM-121, is its ability to bind to human FcgRIIIa on immune effector cells with a 50-fold higher affinity than standard IgG1 antibodies, a property conferred by the engineered glycosylation of the antibody Fc region. Consequently, GE-huMab-HER3 exhibits superior potency and efficacy in ADCC, as shown in vitro using recombinant A549 cells and in vivo by its Fc mediated greater anti-tumor effect in A549 orthotopic mouse models compared to a non-glyco-engineered variant of the antibody, WT-huMab-HER3. The combination of strong signaling inhibition and enhanced ADCC capability renders GE-huMabHER3 a highly potent HER3-targeting agent.

Firstly, inhibition of PAR2 with shRNA or ENMD-1068 (a selective antagonist of PAR2) significantly sensitized EGFR-TKI (gefitinib or AG1478)-induced apoptosis, which was measured with Annexin V/ PI staining and activation of caspase-3 in different CRC cell lines.

Furthermore, inhibition of protein phosphatase (PP) with okadaic acid significantly downregulated bcl-xL. Moreover, knockdown of PP1 with siRNA blocked PAR2-induced accumulation of bcl-xL.

This study was to evaluate antitumor activity of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE, a recently developed bispecific enediyne-energized fusion protein, on esophageal carcinoma, targeting both EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), because both EGFR and HER2 have been shown overexpression in over 30% of esophageal cancers. The fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was encoded by a gene that was genetically constructed by fusing the oligopeptides ligand Ec (22 amino acids of EGF COOH-terminal) and Hr (VH CDR3 region of anti-HER2 C6.5 antibody) with lidamycin (LDM, an enediyne antibiotic with potent cytotoxicity) via two (G4S)3-linker. The encoded 18.4 kDa fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized its binding affinity with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells by flow-cytometry-based immunofluorescence assay. The results showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE protein bound to ESCC cells EC9706 and KYSE150 with high affinity (the Kd values were 5.283mol/L and 3.562mol/L, respectively). The potency of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was determined on four human ESCC cell lines with differential expression of EGFR and HER2 using MTT assay. The bispecific Ec-LDP-Hr-AE showed potent cytotoxicity to EC1, EC109, EC9706 and KYSE150 cells with IC50 values in the picomolar level. Moreover, the bispecific Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was more potent than the monospecific counterparts (Ec-LDP-AE and LDP-Hr-AE) and LDM.

Ec-LDP-Hr-AE also induced cancer cell apoptosis in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells and the induction of apoptosis was in a dosage-dependent manner. The apoptotic index in the EC9706 cells exposed to 0.1, 0.5, or 1 nmol/L of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE were 15.0  0.3%, 38.1  0.6%, and 50.0  0.4%, respectively. Western blotting showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE promoted caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities as well as PARP cleavage, indicating that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondria-caspase cascade. Moreover, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited KYSE150 cancer cell proliferation via decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and further exerted inhibition of the activation of their downstream signaling molecules (e.g. AKT and ERK). In summary, the bispecific energized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE exhibited potent cytotoxicity to ESCC cells in vitro, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via targeting EGFR and HER2.

No therapy, including the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab plus erlotinib, has proven effective in treating AR (Janjigian YY. Clin Cancer Res; Epub Jan 2011). Preclinical data suggest afatinib, a potent ErbB family blocker, is active in T790M M cell lines such as H1975.

Four samples were mutant and six carried the wild-type (WT) genotype. A multiplex PCR was performed in which primers had a gene specific sequence, a patient specific bar code (MID) and Roche sequencing tags. The unique multiplex identifiers (MIDs) allow appropriate mixing of patient samples and differentiation in the sequence data. Amplicon generation was verified by fragment analysis (GeneScan). Amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads, quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen, pooled in equimolar ratios and diluted before emulsion PCR. Sequencing was carried out in 2 runs using Titanium Amplicon chemistry (Lib-A) on a 454 GS Junior. Two samples were analyzed in duplicate to assess reproducibility. Data were analyzed using the amplicon variant analyzer software.Results', ' A throughput of 52.159 and 28.769 high quality reads was achieved for the library in the performed runs.

Here we show that Egfrf/f Runx2-Cre mice (EgfrÎ”Ob), lacking the EGFR in osteo-chondroprogenitor cells, develop an increased zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes in long bones and decreased bone formation. When bred to c-fos transgenic mice (H2-c-fosLTR) that develop osteosarcomas with 100% penetrance, EgfrÎ”Ob mice show reduced tumor incidence and burden. At the molecular level, tumors from EgfrÎ”Ob mice exhibit decreased expression levels of c-Fos and Cyclin D1. In vitro experiments in primary bone tumor cells further show that EGFR inhibition leads to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Importantly, Egfr and c-Fos also play an important role in human OS, as co-expression of both proteins in tumor sections correlated with significantly reduced survival in patients suffering from primary OS.

        "Background":"['Integrin 64 is upregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinomas where it contributes to carcinoma cell invasion, in part, through its coordinated modulation of the transcriptome. Here, we find that integrin 64 signaling dramatically upregulates the expression of several genes involved in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, including amphiregulin (Areg), epiregulin (Ereg), and ectodomain cleavage protease MMP1. Notably, these genes correlate well with integrin 64 expression in publicly available pancreatic cancer databases. We previously reported that integrin 64 promotes HGF-stimulated migration and invasion; therefore, we tested the role of autocrine EGFR signaling in these processes. We discovered that blocking EGFR signaling with EGFR-specific blocking antibodies or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor hindered HGF-stimulated pancreatic carcinoma cell chemotaxis and invasive growth in three-dimensional culture. Furthermore, we found that both Areg and Ereg are required for these autocrine effects, as knocking down either ligand prevented migration and invasion. Notably, AsPC1 cells, isolated from abdominal metastases, are not dependent on EGFR signaling for migration or invasion; thus suggesting a mechanism exists for circumventing EGFR dependency. We also demonstrated that HGF stimulates the secretion of Areg, which is dependent on integrin signaling pathways including MAPK, PI3K and PKC and that Areg was transported to the leading edge of cells treated with HGF. Moreover, MMP activity and integrin 64 signaling are required for Areg secretion. Finally, we found that EGFR is phosphorylated in response to HGF stimulation which was dependent on EGFR protein kinase activity; however, Met phosphorylation in response to HGF was unaffected by EGFR signaling. Taken together, we show that integrin 64 stimulates invasion by promoting autocrine EGFR signaling through the upregulation of key genes and facilitating HGF-stimulated EGFR ligand secretion.']",

        "Background":"['Breast cancers in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes have high rates of tumor metastasis. Tumor metastasis is driven by formation of invadopodia that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) in basement membranes to spread locally and colonize distant sites. Endophilin A2 (Endo II) is an adaptor protein that coordinates internalization and trafficking of receptors that drive invadopodia formation and breast cancer metastasis. We have recently identified Endo II as a positive regulator of human TNBC metastasis, invadopodia formation, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization and signaling. Here, we extend these studies of Endo II to HER2 breast cancers, and define molecular mechanisms that link Endo II to invadopodia formation and cell invasion. Analysis of Endo II expression in human invasive ductal carcinomas revealed significantly high expression of Endo II in HER2 primary tumors, and significantly higher expression in paired lymph node metastases compared to other subtypes. We also observed that high levels of Endo II mRNA was associated with reduced rates of relapse free survival in patients with lymph node positive, estrogen receptor negative tumors. This correlates with our findings that Endo II promotes invadopodia formation and breast cancer cell invasion. Mechanistically, these defects may be due to reduced EGFR signaling and lowered expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature genes observed in Endo II knock-down (KD) cells. We are currently validating these results in mammary orthotopic tumor xenograft models of HER2 and TNBC cell models with stable Endo II KD. Together, these findings identify high levels of Endo II in high risk breast cancer subtypes, with high expression of EMT genes, and a potential link between Endo II levels and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.']",

Expression of EREG affects sensitivity to cetuximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody that inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway. The mechanism through which EREG is regulated is largely unknown, but a methyl-array study performed by our group revealed that EREG is methylated in gastric cancer cells. In the present study, we found that EREG gene expression was low in seven out of 11 gastric cancer cells and this down-regulation was mediated by aberrant CpG methylation of the EREG promoter. Treatment with 5-aza-CdR restored EREG expression and demethylated the CpG sites in the EREG promoter. Compared to DNMT1, knockdown of DNMT3b significantly increased the expression of EREG mRNA and led to the demethylation of specific CpG sites in the EREG promoter, suggesting that DNMT3b primarily regulates the CpG methylation and silencing of EREG gene. EREG methylation was observed in 30% (4/13) of human primary gastric tumor tissues. In addition to DNA methylation, results from a ChIP assay demonstrated that transcriptional levels of EREG were associated with the enrichment of active histone markers (H3K4me3 and AcH3) and of a repressive marker (H3K27me2). Treatment with 5-aza-CdR dynamically increased the low occupancy of H3K4me3 and AcH3, while decreasing the high enrichment of H3K27me2, indicating that dynamic histone modifications contribute to EREG regulation in addition to DNA methylation. Lastly, the combination of 5-aza-CdR and cetuximab exerted a synergistic anti-proliferative effect on gastric cancer cells. Taken together, the results of our study demonstrated for the first time that EREG is epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer cells by aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification.']",

        "Background":"['Chemotherapy induces influx of bone marrow-derived progenitors such as mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial progenitors and proangiogenic monocytes into the primary tumor to promote angiogenesis. Thus it is feared that chemotherapy may potentiate tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that paclitaxel delays tumor growth in several mammary carcinoma mouse and human breast cancer models, yet it significantly increases the density of microanatomical sites called tumor microenvironment of metastasis (TMEM) that are responsible for tumor cell intravasation and dissemination of breast cancer. The TMEM site consists of a Mena-overexpressing cancer cell in direct contact with a Tie2hi/VEGFhi macrophage and an underlying endothelial cell. Mice treated with paclitaxel have significantly more circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastatic foci when compared to vehicle-treated animals indicating that the chemotherapy-induced TMEM are active in assisting tumor cell intravasation. Moreover, syngeneic transplantation of Dendra2+/PyMT tumors into FVB recipients showed significantly higher incidence of Dendra2+ cells in the lung, following paclitaxel administration. In parallel experiments, paclitaxel induced the influx of macrophages and intravasation of cancer cells as observed using intravital imaging of MMTV-PyMT-Dendra2/Cfms-CFP mice, in which blood vessels were visualized with Quantum dots. Furthermore, paclitaxel treatment in experimental mice caused a significant increase in the expression of Mena at the gene and protein levels. PCR assays for total Mena (PanMena) or specific Mena isoforms (MenaINV, Mena11a) revealed that this increase was particularly attributed to the invasive Mena isoforms [i.e. MenaINV and MenaCalc (Menacalc = PanMena - Mena11a)]. These pre-clinical data are supported by the findings from a cohort of 10 breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant dose-dense paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide. Of these tumors, 7/10 patients had more than 2-fold increase in TMEM density following neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Moreover, chemotherapy produced an acute increase of up to 150-fold in MenaINV expression in 3/7 and up to 5.5-fold in MenaCalc in 3/4 patients who underwent serial fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy before and after 1-2 doses of either neoadjuvant paclitaxel or doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide. This is provocative because an increase in either MenaCalc score or TMEM density are independently associated with increased risk of distant recurrence in breast cancer patients. In conclusion, our data indicate that paclitaxel treatment induces intravasation-mediated dissemination of breast cancer cells in rodents and in certain clinical scenarios in humans by promoting increases in MenaCalc expression and TMEM intravasation sites.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Efficacy of gefitinib therapy strongly depends on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutation status in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, cumulative data from many clinical studies demonstrated that some patients with wild-type (WT) EGFR also responded to gefitinib and remained stable. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of gefitiinb in NSCLC patients who failed previous chemotherapy with WT EGFR tumors.  Methods', '  Patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC whose tumors have WT EGFR were eligible. Gefitinib (250 mg/day) was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary end point was disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks.  Results', '  Eighty-five patients (53 men and 32 women; median age, 60 years; range, 30-86) were enrolled between October 2010 and May 2013. Seventy-four (87.1%) had adenocarcinoma, nine (10.6%) had squamous cell carcinoma. Forty-one patients (48.2%) were treated with gefitinib as second-line chemotherapy and 34 patients (40.0%) as third-line chemotherapy. Eleven patients showed partial response, and twenty-one had stable disease. Thus, response rate was 12.9%, and DCR was 37.6%. Skin rash was the most common side effect. One patient developed interstitial lung disease (grade 2). The median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 1.9 and 10.9 months, respectively.  Conclusions', '  Gefitinib might be an alternative option for pretreated patients even in those with WT EGFR NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Given that cancer cells are exposed to environmental stressors such as oxygen or nutrient deficiency, low pH, inflammatory mediators, and ROS during tumor progression,the ability to avoid the consequences of such exposure is required for cancer cell survival. CD44 is a major marker for stem-like cancer cells in many epithelial tumors and has been implicated in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. CD44 exists in numerous variant isoforms (CD44v) that are generated through alternative mRNA splicing. We recently showed that interaction of CD44v with the cystine transporter subunit xCT stabilizes the latter protein and thereby potentiates the ability of cancer cells to defend themselves against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Stem-like cancer cells in which defense against ROS is enhanced by CD44v are thus thought to drive tumor growth, chemoresistance and metastasis.In the present study, we show that head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells that express CD44v rely on the activity of the cystine transporter subunit xCT for control of their redox status. Ablation of CD44v attenuated the xCT dependency as well as tumor-forming ability in HNSCC cells, and xCT inhibition selectively induced apoptosis in CD44v-expressing tumor cells. In contrast, CD44v-negative differentiated cells manifest epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and rely largely on EGFR activity for their survival. Combined treatment with inhibitors of xCT-dependent cystine transport and of EGFR may induce apoptosis in distinct subpopulations of HNSCC tumor cells.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Synthetic lethal interaction between EGFR and PARP inhibition",
        "Background":"['Purpose', ' Dysregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family is a hallmark of many cancers. Although targeting of EGFR family has improved outcomes, many patients ultimately fail this therapy. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have gained recent attention due to their unique selectivity in killing homologous recombination (HR)-deficient tumors while maintaining minimal toxicity in normal tissues. We have previously shown that EGFR inhibition induces synthetic lethality with PARPi in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) in vitro by attenuating DNA repair pathways. In this study, we validated these observations in vivo in HNSCCs xenografts. Importantly, we also tested this strategy in other EGFR dysregulated cancers. Methods', ' Cervical, breast, and head and neck cancer cell lines were used in this study. DNA damage and repair were assessed by immunofluorescence staining of cells for -H2AX, Rad51, and DNA-Pk foci and/or chromosomally integrated HR and nonhomologous end-joining based GFP reporter assays. Cell viability was determined via colony formation and ATPlite assays. Tumor growth delay was assessed in mice bearing tumor xenografts. Results', ' Combined EGFR and PARP inhibition resulted in the greatest tumor growth delay versus either agent alone in mice bearing head and neck tumor xenografts (9 week tumor growth delay when compared to PARPi alone, 3 week tumor growth delay when compared to EGFR inhibitor alone). This correlated with persistent -H2AX foci indicative of unresolved DNA damage. Interestingly, this combination was also effective in other EGFR dysregulated tumors. Human cervical and breast cancer cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity with EGFR and PARP inhibition compared to either agent alone (80-99% cytotoxicity with combination vs 0-20% with either agent alone). Similar to head and neck cancer, susceptibility to PARPi induced by EGFR inhibition was associated with deficient NHEJ- and HR-mediated DNA repair and subsequent persistence of DNA damage. Conclusions', ' Thus, by generating a DNA repair deficit, EGFR inhibition can induce synthetic lethality with PARP inhibition. This can be an innovative treatment strategy for tumors with dysregulated EGFR signaling.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Curcumin inhibition of the functional interaction between integrin 64 and the epidermal growth factor receptor",
        "Background":"['The functional interaction between integrin 64 and growth factor receptors has been implicated in key signaling pathways important for cancer cell function. However, few attempts have been made to selectively target this interaction for therapeutic intervention. Previous studies showed that curcumin, a yellow pigment isolated from tumeric, inhibits integrin 64 signaling important for breast carcinoma cell motility and invasion, but the mechanism is not currently known. To address this issue, we tested the hypothesis that curcumin inhibits the functional interaction between 64 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this study, we found that curcumin disrupts functional and physical interactions between 64 and EGFR, and blocks 64/EGFR dependent functions of carcinoma cells expressing the signaling competent form of 64. We further demonstrated that curcumin inhibits EGF dependent mobilization of 64 from hemidesmosomes to the leading edges of migrating cells such as lammelipodia and filopodia, and thereby prevents 64 distribution to lipid rafts where functional interactions between 64 and EGFR occur. These data suggest a novel paradigm in which curcumin inhibits 64 signaling and functions by altering intracellular localization of 64, thus preventing its association with signaling receptors such as EGFR.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Targeting HER3 and EGFR in NRG1 positive and HER3 mutated lung squamous cell carcinoma",
        "Background":"['HER3 is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Aberrant activation of HER3 as a result of HER2 amplification or neuregulin 1 (NRG1) over-expression has been demonstrated to mediate constitutive activation of downstream oncogenic signals. LJM716 is a fully human IgG1 anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody. It locks HER3 in an inactive conformation and prevents HER3 dimerization with other ErbB family members. This unique mode of action enables LJM716 to block both ligand dependent and ligand independent HER3 activation. In search of new indications that may benefit from anti-HER3 therapies, we noted that squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) tend to have relatively higher NRG1 expression as compared to their adenocarcinoma counterparts. Highest NRG1 expression was observed in the lung SCC cell lines in cell line encyclopedia (CLE). A subset of the lung SCC cell lines with high NRG1 expression are moderately sensitive to LJM716, with HER3 activation detected in all of the sensitive lines. Additionally, EGFR activation is consistently observed in our panel of squamous lung carcinoma models. In some cases, activation of HER2 and/or HER3 is also noted. We hypothesize that squamous lung carcinomas may be dependent on signaling through EGFR, HER2 and HER3. To completely block EGFR, HER2-HER3 signaling, we set to test the treatment of LJM716 and Cetixumab in a number of NGR 1 positive squamous lung carcinomas tumor models. Enhanced anti tumor activity of LJM716 and Cetixumab is observed in four out nine tumor models. Analysis of broad activation status of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) reveals that a subset of responsive models have activated pEGFR, pHER2 and pHER3. These data suggest that activated HER3 signaling may be important in a subset of lung squamous cell carcinoma. Combination of anti-HER3 and anti EGFR treatment is effective at inhibiting growth in these tumors.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",
