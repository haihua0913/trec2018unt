        "Background":"['Background', ' Undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma is the most aggressive type of thyroid carcinoma. It is refractory to most of the conventional therapies and its median overall survival is less than six months. Mutation in BRAF gene was found around 25% of undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. Mutated BRAF particularly the V600E mutated BRAF auto-activates the BRAF-MEK proliferation-survival cell signalling pathway. The objectives of our current study were to inhibit the BRAF kinase and investigate its effect on undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma proliferation.Materials and methods', ' 8050C, a homozygous BRAF V600E mutate undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cell line, was used to develop anti-BRAF shRNA stable cell line. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot were performed for ratifying the BRAF inhibition efficiency of stable cell line. Proliferation and colony formation assay were done to see the effect of BRAF inhibition on undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma proliferation. In addition, impact of BRAF inhibition on proliferation cell signalling pathways were checked through western blot analysis.Results', ' Efficiency of BRAF knockdown was around 87% which resulted in approximately 83% inhibition of BRAF kinase (p < 0.05). About 54% proliferation inhibition (p < 0.05) was observed in the BRAF inhibited group compare to control group in the first week. But the proliferation rate in the BRAF inhibited group increased over the subsequent weeks and we did not observed any sign of cell growth arrest. In addition, colony formation assay revealed approximately 13% reduction of colony formation ability (p < 0.05) in BRAF inhibited group compare to control group. Western blot analysis of signalling kinases discovered reduction of around 72% MEK kinase activity after BRAF kinase inhibition. As we observed increasing trend of proliferation after an initial sharp drop in cell proliferation after BRAF kinase inhibition, we hypothesized and analysed the alternative PI3K-AKT proliferation pathway. Surprisingly we found about 63% increase of AKT kinase activity in the BRAF inhibited group compare to control group (p < 0.05).Conclusions', ' Inhibition of BRAF kinase reduced cell proliferation initially, but this proliferation inhibition did not lead to cell growth arrest at the end. Increased AKT kinase activity counteracted the effect of BRAF kinase inhibition as AKT kinase has the ability to contribute in overall cell proliferation. Therefore, both kinases need to be inhibited simultaneously for cell growth arrest in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' High dose iodine intake is used as a prophylactic measure to protect thyroid from deleterious effects of radioactive iodine in case of nuclear accidents. In vitro, high concentration iodine delays oncogenic effects of RET/PTC3 in thyroid follicular cells, although its role during BRAF oncogene activation remains unclear. BRAF mutation (T1799A) is the most prevalent alteration during thyroid follicular cells oncogenesis leading to thyroid cancer. BRAFT1799A is associated to aggressive thyroid tumors and poor prognosis. High levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b and miR-92, components of miR-17-92 cluster, are associated with several aggressive tumors such as lung cancer and thyroid carcinoma. Aberrant miRNA expression may cooperate to tumorigenesis as it regulates protein levels of different target mRNA from several signaling pathways. Therefore, in this study we aim at analyzing the role of iodine in miRNAs activated by BRAFT1799A oncogene. Methods', ' Cell culture and treatment', ' BRAF9-6 cells derived from rat thyroid follicular cells express conditionally BRAFT1799A in the presence of doxaciclin (Dox, at 1g/mL). Early BRAFT1799A activation was analyzed after 48 hours of induction (Dox group). Five-days long iodine treatment was performed using culture media containing 10-5M sodium iodide (NaI group), and dox was added at day 3 (Dox+NaI group). Control group (Ctr) was performed in the absence of Dox and NaI; gene expression', ' detection of miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b and snoRNA was performed by qPCR. protein levels', ' Smad4 protein expression was investigated by Western-blotting using specific monoclonal antibodies against Smad4. Alfa-tubulin was detected as load control. Results', ' Early effects of BRAFT1799A in miRNA expression involve activation of miR-17-92 cluster in thyroid follicular cells. Conditional induction of BRAFT1799A (Dox group) results in a 85.8- fold, 634.3 fold and 141.6-fold increase in miR-19a, miR-19b and miR-18a, respectively, compared to control (Ctr group). Moreover, treating cells with iodine before BRAF activation (Dox+NaI group) resulted in partial or complete abrogation of this effect, with expression levels of miR-18a, miR-19a and miR-19b in 2.7-fold, 2.36-fold and 0.66-fold of Ctr group, respectively. Bioinformatic target prediction for miR-19a and miR-19b shows that Smad4 mRNA contain predicted binding sites in the 3-UTR for these miRNAs. Smad4 is the key transducer of TGFB inhibitory signalling, frequently misbalanced in cancer. BRAF induction reduced Smad4 protein levels, effect abolished by previous iodine treatment, suggesting Smad4 as a possible target of miR-19a and miR-19b.

FNA evaluation provides a definitive diagnosis in the majority of cases, but about 20-30% of nodules are deemed indeterminate. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and gene expression analysis have been used as ancillary tests to provide additional information about the malignancy risk for indeterminate thyroid lesions. Here we develop a 31 gene NGS panel, as well as a 14 gene expression panel, and test their performance on thyroid lesions with known diagnosis. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue from 23 resected thyroid lesions (1 non-neoplastic, 3 follicular adenomas (FA), 1 medullary carcinoma (MC), 7 follicular carcinomas (FC), 7 papillary carcinomas (PC), 4 follicular variant of papillary carcinomas (FVPC)) was evaluated. Total nucleic acid extraction, NGS (31 genes including', ' NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, BRAF, RET, PTEN, AKT1, TP53, GNAS, ALK, DDR2, EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR1/2/3, GNA11, GNAQ, IDH1/2, KIT, MAP2K1, MET, MTOR, NOTCH1, PDGFRA, EPHA2, ESR1, RAC1, and ROS1) through Bio Reference Laboratories, and gene expression analysis (14 genes', ' KRT7, TTF-1, TG, PGK-1, CK-20, PTH, CALCA, RAP2A, PLAB, HMGA2, FN-1, GAL-3, CK19, and NIS) were performed. This assay detected mutations in 14/19 malignant lesions including 4/7 FCs (NRAS, TP53), 4/4 FVPC (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, PTEN), 5/7 PCs (BRAF, NRAS), and 1/1 MC (RET). No mutations were detected in the non-neoplastic thyroid and 1/3 FAs contained a KRAS mutation. All three mutation-negative FCs were oncocytic variants and showed upregulation of ≥2 cancer-associated genes including FN-1, GAL-3, HMGA2, PLAB, and RAP2a. The two mutation-negative PCs showed upregulation of 4 cancer-associated genes including FN-1, CK-19, GAL-3, HMGA2, and PLAB. This upregulation was not seen in non-neoplastic thyroid and was seen in only 1 of the FAs (FN-1, GAL-3, and PLAB). This small study demonstrates that a combination of NGS and gene expression increases the assay sensitivity (100% versus 74% sensitivity) and negative predictive value (100% versus <45% for NGS or gene expression alone). The positive predictive value of the combined assay was 90% versus 93% for either assay alone. The addition of gene fusions will likely further improve the assay’s diagnostic capacity. In conclusion, the addition of a gene expression assay to this thyroid NGS assay allowed for identification of mutation-negative thyroid malignancies. The improved detection of malignant thyroid lesions will allow for better risk assessment for indeterminate nodules as well as improved treatment algorithms.']",

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer, which is three to four times more prevalent in women than men, is the most common endocrine-related cancer in the United States and its incidence has increased in the past three decades. Among various genetic lesions identified in thyroid cancer, the BRAF V600E mutation is found in 50% of papillary thyroid cancers and affords an opportunity for targeted drug therapy. Our laboratory identified estrogen as a promotional factor in thyroid cancer, as estrogen enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells in vitro. Since the mitotic activity of estrogen is partially mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, we hypothesized that a targeted BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4032, would inhibit estrogen-mediated tumor-promoting activity. Results demonstrate that PLX4032 abrogates estrogen-induced increases in proliferation and invasion of BRAF V600E-mutated BCPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, this phenomenon was not observed in Nthy-ori 3-1 thyroid cells, which are wild-type immortalized thyroid cells without the BRAF V600E mutation. Expression of estrogen receptor is not modulated by PLX4032 treatment, indicating that PLX4032 targets signal transduction pathways in estrogen-responsive thyroid cells. PLX4032 down-regulates the expression of key signaling molecules of the BRAF pathway, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (p-MEK), extracellular-signal regulated kinases (p-ERK), and mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) in BRAF-mutated BCPAP cells and does not alter the expression of these signaling molecules in wild-type Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. These results demonstrate a direct interlinking of a genetic lesion amenable to drug therapy with the promotional activity of estrogen. These findings will lead to an evaluation of combinational therapy including anti-estrogens and PLX4032 in preclinical animal models and a subset of patients harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. Targeting growth-promoting signal transduction pathways constitutively activated by genetic lesions will ultimately aid in overcoming resistance to traditional radioactive iodine therapy in patients with specific mutations such as BRAF V600E.']",

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and incidences are rising. MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in playing a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of thyroid cancer, as evidenced by the high incidence of non-overlapping mutations of the genes encoding RET and TRK, as well as of NRAS, HRAS, KRAS and BRAF. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is commonly associated with mutations of the RAS family of oncoproteins, while papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is often associated with mutations in BRAF. To determine whether mode of MAPK activation played a role in thyroid cancer development in mice, we generated HrasG12V and BrafV600E knock-in models. We report that a thyroid specific knock-in of HrasG12V and Pten inactivation leads to the development of FTCs and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTCs) by 47-52 weeks of age in HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre mice. In stark contrast, mice with a thyroid specific knock-in of BrafV600E and loss of Pten (BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre) rapidly develop PDTCs and anaplastic thyroid cancer with complete lethality by weaning, suggesting that Braf and Hras, in cooperation with PI3K signaling, likely play distinct roles in the development and progression of disease. We next sought to dissect the role of Hras versus Braf activation in FTC versus PTC development. We derived stable cell lines from HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre and BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre tumors in order to identify cellular and molecular consequences of Hras versus Braf activation and their potential impact on tumor phenotype. We have found significant differences in phosphorylation of kinases in response to Hras versus Braf activation. Hras activation leads to increased phosphorylation of mTOR effectors, while Braf activation increases CREB activation. Studies are ongoing to identify the molecular mechanism of these observed differences. We have also shown a significant decrease in the growth of HrasG12V/Ptenhom (p=0.0009) and BrafV600E/Ptenhom (p=0.0001) cells treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, suggesting that activated Hras or Braf-even in the context of Pten loss-partially relies on MAPK signaling to reach its full oncogenic potential. We have recently employed a PCR array approach to identify differences in the expression of genes related to the MAPK pathway in HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom cell lines. We noted an up-regulation of Myc, Cdkn1a, and Sfn in BrafV600E/Ptenhom cells in comparison to HrasG12V/Ptenhom cells, which may contribute to the different pathophysiology of HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom tumor sub-types. Because FTCs and PTCs have different responses to therapy, we seek to identify the cellular and physiological consequences of Ras versus Raf activation which will hopefully aid in the discovery of novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for thyroid cancer.']",

TGF signaling deregulation is observed in thyroid cancer, which shows high frequence of MAPK genetic alteration. BRAF mutation (BRAFT1799A), the most prevalent alteration in thyroid cancer, induces MAPK activtion and thyroid oncogenesis. In this process, deregulation of microRNAs potentiates oncogene activation. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate protein levels by pairing to 3-UTR of mRNA and blocking translation. miR-17-92 cluster of microRNAs, miR-17-5p/3p, miR-18a, miR-19a/b, miR20a and miR-92a, regulates several tumor-suppressor genes and is predicted to target TGF pathway components.

While the incidence/diagnosis of FVPTC is growing in the U.S., the genetic characteristics of the disease remain poorly understood, and there is a need for complementary molecular assays that can help discriminate between the more benign forms of FVPTC and those that will exhibit an aggressive clinical course.In this study, we performed molecular analysis of 101 FVPTC archival surgical specimens using the SNaPshot multiplexed targeted sequencing platform, to interrogate 90 genetic loci frequently mutated in 21 cancer genes, including the BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and CTNNB1 (-catenin) oncogenes commonly altered in thyroid cancer. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of cDNA obtained from the same tumors was used to test for the presence of RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 gene rearrangements found in PTC, and for PAX8-PPAR gene fusions characteristic of FTC. We detected mutually exclusive genetic aberrations in 68 (67%) FVTPC. These included 25 (25%) BRAF V600E mutations, 26 (26%) mutations in NRAS (22 Q61R and 4 Q61K), 13 (13%) mutations in HRAS (9 Q61R, 3 Q61K, and 1 G13R) and 3 (3%) KRAS G12V mutations. We identified one (1%) single case of PAX8-PPAR gene rearrangement and no RET/PTC gene fusions.Patient medical records and tumor histopathological characteristics will be retrospectively reviewed to determine whether the FVPTC genotype is significantly associated with clinicopathological features of diagnostic and prognostic importance that could help inform therapeutic decisions for this commonly diagnosed endocrine tumor.']",

A trial with vemurafenib for thyroid cancer patients is now in progress.We compared the response of thyroid and melanoma cell lines harboring BRAFV600E to vemurafenib and found that the majority of thyroid cancer cells were refractory to the inhibitor (IC50 > 1.5 M). In addition, thyroid cancer cell lines showed a rebound in pERK beginning 6h post-treatment and a transient activation of pAKT. Expression profiling and pRTK array screens of PLX4032-treated cells showed higher expression and activation of HER family receptors, particularly HER2 and HER3. Phosphorylation of HER3 represented the most consistent PLX4032-dependent RTK activated across thyroid cancer cell lines (5/6 lines tested) and was not detectable in any of the melanoma or colorectal cancer cells we investigated. HER3 phosphorylation was also induced by the allosteric MEK inhibitor PD0325901 in thyroid cancers of TPO-Cre/LSL-BrafV600E mice. We identified HER2 as the main HER3 heterodimerization partner, which was activated via a neuregulin-dependent autocrine loop, which was specific to the thyroid cancer lineage, as it was not observed in either melanoma or colorectal BRAF-mutant lines. HER3 transcription was induced by MAPK inhibition, via dissociation of the CTBP1/2 transcriptional repressors from the HER3 gene promoter. Finally, the HER2/HER3 kinase inhibitor lapatinib sensitized BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells to growth inhibition by RAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, providing rationale for combination therapies in this disease. Hence, the early response of BRAF-mutant cancers to selective MAPK pathway inhibitors is marked by the relaxation of oncoprotein-driven negative feedback events, which differ between tumors of various lineages, and which predict a requirement for distinct therapeutic strategies.']",

Iodine excess exerts anti-proliferative effects in thyroid cells associated to TGF pathway enhancement, although refractoriness to TGF inhibitory signal is observed in thyroid cancer. We previously showed that high iodine dose protects thyroid cells from BRAF-induced genomic instability and also, delays oncogenic effects of RET/PTC3 oncogene. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate protein levels by pairing to 3-UTR of mRNA and blocking translation. MiR-19 belongs to cluster miR-17-92 which attenuates several tumor-suppressor genes and is predicted to target TGF pathway components. Therefore, we aim to analyze the influence of iodine on microRNA-mediated TGF signaling in BRAFT1799A activated thyroid follicular cells. Methods', ' BRAF9-6 cells, derived from normal rat thyroid follicular cell, which express BRAFT1799A under doxacyclin stimulation were treated with iodine-containing medium at 10-5M (NaI group) for 5 days. Dox treatment was performed for 2 days (Dox-group), in the absence or presence of iodine (Dox+NaI-group). Control was performed without Dox/NaI. MiR-19 expression was performed by real-time qPCR and Smad4 target validation was performed by Western-blotting and luciferase-assay. TGF responsiveness was evaluated by analyzing cell cycle of TGF-treated cells using flow-cytometry. Results', ' BRAFT1799A induction in thyroid cells increased miR-19a and miR-19b levels in 634.3-fold/141.6-fold, respectively (Dox vs Control), while adding iodine prior to BRAFT1799A induction resulted in 2.36-fold/0.66-fold levels (Dox+NaI vs Control). Iodine per se treatment did not change miR-19 levels. BRAFT1799A induction reduced Smad4 protein which was restored by iodine treatment. In parallel to the low Smad4 levels during BRAFT1799A-activation, we observed an impairment of responsiveness to recombinant TGF treatment. Moreover, the iodine-containing medium restored the inhibitory signal and rendered cells arrested in G1-phase. Bioinformatic search for miR-19 potential targets revealed Smad4 as a predicted target which was validated by luciferase-assay that showed reduced luminescence of Smad4 3-UTR plasmid in the presence miR-19.

Embelin, a XIAP inhibitor, is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory and apoptotic activities. Recent reports suggest that embelin interferes the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signal pathway. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer efficacy of embelin by measuring its effects on apoptosis of thyroid cancer cell lines. We also explored the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that embelin induced the apoptosis of human thyroid cancer cell lines, such as FTC-133, CAL-62, KTC-1, and 8505C. The effect was stronger in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines (KTC-1 and 8505C) than wild-type cell lines (FTC-133 and CAL-62). The effect of embelin on cell apoptosis was associated with increased phosphorylation of p38. SB203580 inhibited the embelin mediated induction of cleaved caspase-3 activity in V600E mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. Interestingly, embelin induced apoptosis in BRAF wild type cancer cell lines, even after treatment of SB203580. These results indicated that another signaling pathway, not a p38 pathway, might be existed for embelin induced apoptosis in BRAF wild type thyroid cancer cell. In conclusion, embelin-induced XIAP suppression resulted in an increase of apoptosis via phosphorylation of p38 in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines.

        "Meeting_name":" Resistance mechanisms to targeted molecular therapy in thyroid cancer",
        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is increasingly common in the United States. Although prognosis is generally very good, thyroid cancer has a high recurrence rate and there are limited treatment options available for advanced metastatic disease. Since genetic mutations causing over-activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway are found in over 70% of papillary thyroid cancers, molecular inhibitors targeting these kinases are promising therapeutics. A multikinase inhibitor, Sorafenib, was recently FDA-approved for treatment of advanced thyroid cancer as it significantly increased progression-free survival time. To build upon this success, improvement in efficacy and reduction in common side effects may be possible through more targeted approaches. The most common specific mutation to target is BRAFV600E which occurs in 50% of papillary thyroid cancers and 25% of anaplastic thyroid cancers. BRAFV600E is correlated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, resistance to traditional therapy, and cancer-related mortality in papillary thyroid cancer. PLX4032 (Vemurafenib) is a specific kinase inhibitor developed to halt BRAFV600E-mediated excessive activation of the MAPK pathway. BRAFV600E-positive malignant melanoma patients treated with PLX4032 often experience astounding tumor regression followed by development of drug resistance, which is thought to be acquired through signaling via alternative molecules, bypassing the need for BRAFV600E kinase activity. We hypothesized that treatment with PLX4032 would inhibit MAPK signaling and promote an anti-proliferative phenotype in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAFV600E, without having these effects on BRAF-wildtype cells. In BRAF-mutated cells, we also predicted that certain signaling molecules could become activated to circumvent the PLX4032-mediated inhibition, as seen in melanoma. Results demonstrate that PLX4032 inhibits proliferation, causes apoptosis, and arrests cell cycle selectively in BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cells. These phenotypic responses corresponded to diminished phosphorylation of central signaling proteins downstream of BRAF, including MEK, ERK, and mTOR. The mutated papillary thyroid cancer cells express both MAP3K8 (COT) and CRAF, kinases capable of growth-promoting signaling independent of BRAFV600E, in the face of PLX4032 treatment over time. These results indicate that targeted inhibition of BRAFV600E creates powerful anti-tumor effects in thyroid cancer cells, although mechanisms of resistance similar to those seen in melanoma patients may also occur. Detailed investigation into cell signaling pathways that contribute to thyroid cancer progression will allow for more effective combinational targeted molecular therapy and limit development of drug resistance to specific inhibitors such as PLX4032.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAFV600E mutation represents the most common oncogenic event in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Although at a much lower frequency, different missense point mutations (K601E, G474R, G469R) and complex genetic alterations, such as rearrangements (AKAP9-BRAF) or frameshift mutations (V600EK601del, V599ins, V600D-FLAGT601-605ins, T599I-VKSRdel), have also been reported in PTC. In contrast with PTC, no other alteration different from the V600E substitution has been shown in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). In this study, we sought to determine the functional relevance of particular aminoacid residues, within the BRAF kinase domain, that we found mutated in some ATC. Fifty-four ATC were investigated for the existence of mutations at the activation loop, the glicine-rich phosphate-binding loop and the AKT binding sites of BRAF by means of PCR-SSCP and direct sequence. The structural-conformational changes behind punctual, unreported BRAF mutations and their effect on BRAF catalytic activity, substrate binding and downstream MAPK signalling were evaluated. Besides the V600E mutation, two additional point mutations (G615E and G474R) were detected within the BRAF kinase domain. The prevalence of both mutations, G615E (11% = 6 ATC) and G474R (7.4% = 4 ATC), was much lower than that of V600E (20% = 11 ATC). Interestingly, structural biology studies showed that G615E and G474R induced profound conformational changes within the BRAF kinase domain that resulted in reduced catalytic activity, decreased substrate binding and impaired downstream signalling. The G474R mutant, by preventing the N lobe from folding into a well ordered beta sheet structure, caused a broken or distorted phosphorylation-loop (P-loop). Because the P-loop is pivotal for ATP coordination and phosphotransfer reactions, the kinase activity of the BRAF G474R mutant was severely compromised and BRAF was unable to phosphorylate the downstream substrate. The G615E mutant by disrupting the structural integrity of the activation segment in the C lobe could in addition inhibit substrate binding. Significantly, none of the ATC bearing the G615E or the G474R mutation expressed the phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), which specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated and active forms of ERK1 and ERK2. This observation not only supported the existence of impaired BRAF kinase activity in vivo but also suggested the abrogation of intracellular MEK/ERK signalling in those tumours. In summary, this study demonstrates that G615E and G474R behave similarly to D594V and the kinase-dead BRAFK483M mutant, knocking-down BRAF catalytic activity and downstream MEK/ERK signalling. Clinical trials involving the inhibitor of threonine/serine kinases Sorafenib or kinase specific inhibitors targeting constitutively active BRAF will prove inefficient therapeutic strategies in patients with G615E or G474R mutations.']",

Early clinical trials using inhibitors to this mutant protein or its substrates, the MEK1/2 kinases, prolonged progression-free survival or stabilized disease in patients with advanced PTC. However, the toxicities of these inhibitors are uniquely highlighted in an indolent disease like PTC, which would require patients to endure toxicities long-term. Our goal was to determine if tetrathimoybdate (TM), a well-tolerated copper chelator we have previously shown to inhibit BRAF-mutated melanoma via MEK inhibition, can inhibit BRAF-driven PTC growth. Methods', ' We assessed TM in comparison to current standard of care (SOC), Lenvatinib and Sorafenib, and mutant BRAF inhibitor, Vemurafenib. Anchorage independent growth assays were used to test the inhibitory effect of these drugs on human BRAF-mutated PTC cell lines. We then confirmed these findings by treating a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of aggressive BRAF-driven PTC. Results', ' TM inhibited 57.5% of colony growth in vitro, which was not significantly different from the 42.4% and 32.2% inhibition by Sorafenib and Lenvatinib, respectively. TM inhibition was less effective than the 70.3% inhibition by Vemurafenib (p =0.04). We confirmed these results in vivo, where mice on the TM arm, on average, were observed to have 14.8% of their thyroid glands occupied by tumor, a statistically significant reduction from the mice in the control arm, whose tumor load averaged 23.6% (p= 0.008). This 37.4% reduction in tumor burden was not statistically different from the 35.2% reduction measured in the Vemurafenib arm, where mice on average had 15.3% of their thyroid glands replaced by tumor. Conclusions', ' The copper chelator, TM, was as effective as the SOCs, Lenvatinib and Sorafenib, at inhibiting the growth of human PTC in vitro. Although TM was slightly less effective than Vemurafenib in vitro, TM was as effective as Vemurafenib at reducing tumor load in a GEMM of BRAF-driven PTC.

While targeting BRAFV600E offers particular effectiveness and selectivity in inhibiting cancer cells in the short term, resistance does develop. Prior results in our laboratory confirmed that vemurafenib halts DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis in our mutated thyroid cancer cells.

Resistant cells were characterized by hyperactive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and resistance to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. These additional targets mediating resistance provide an opportunity to devise novel synergistic combination therapies.

ATC is frequently resistant to conventional therapy and therefore it is essential to expand the number of treatment options for ATC. Proto-oncogenes RET, RAS and BRAF are some of the best targets described in thyroid cancer. Sorafenib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits RAF, MEK and ERK kinases among other targets and is therefore being evaluated in several phase II/III clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Quinacrine, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NFKB signaling, is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials. We have previously shown the effectiveness of quinacrine in combination with cytotoxic drugs in hepatocellular and colon carcinoma cells acts by inhibiting NFKB, Mcl-1, and angiogenesis in tumor cell lines that are deficient in p53. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of quinacrine in combination with sorafenib on a panel of human ATC cells. Quinacrine as a single agent effectively inhibits growth and promote apoptosis of ATC cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by CellTiter-Glo and sub-G1 analysis respectively. Combinatorial dose-response modulation of quinacrine with sorafenib suggests a synergistic drug-drug interaction with respect to growth stasis of ATC cells in vitro, as defined by Chou-Talalay. Western blot analysis suggest that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1, over-expressed in a number of solid tumors, is efficiently down-regulated in the ATC cell line 8505C by the combination of quinacrine and sorafenib. We also observe that the active form of transcription factor Stat3 is down-regulated by both quinacrine and sorafenib. In contrast to chloroquine that inhibits autophagy, our previous results have not shown that quinacrine's anti-tumor efficacy involves alterations in autophagy. Furthermore, sorafenib and quinacrine significantly improve survival in a mouse thyroid orthotopic in vivo xenograft model of ATC. We are currently exploring the detailed molecular mechanism of the quinacrine and sorafenib drug synergy and associated anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo.

However, the effect of these genetic alterations in other signaling pathways remains unclear, which could, at least in part, cooperates in transformation. Recently, Notch signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis in other cancer types. In this study, we test the hypothesis that RET/PTC and BRAFT1799A oncogenes crosstalks and regulates Notch pathway. Methods', ' TPC-1 and BCPAP (human PTC cells harboring RET/PTC1 rearrangement and BRAFT1799A mutation, respectively) were treated with gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) and proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay and growth curve; cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. PCCL3 cells harboring Doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3 and BRAFT1799A (PC-BRAF) were used to analyze protein and gene expression by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Notch1 protein expression was analyzed in transgenic mice (Tg-BRAF) which harbor targeted expression of BRAFT1799A restricted to thyroid gland. Results', ' PTC cells treated with GSI decreased the percentage of viable cell in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the growth rate. Cell cycle analysis in PTC cells showed enhancement of DNA fragmentation and increased apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the GSI treatment in PTC cells modulates cell cycle related genes, increasing CDKN1A and CDKN1B gene expression and reducing CCND1, MCM6, CKS2, and MADL2 expression. Conditional activation of RET/PTC3 and BRAFT1799A in PTC3-5 and PC-BRAF cells, respectively, showed a sustained enhancement in pERK protein expression, increased Notch1 protein and gene expression and Hes1 gene expression, the target gene of Notch signaling. Furthermore, transgenic mice Tg-BRAF showed a stronger stain for Notch1 in follicular and stromal cells. Treating PTC cells with MEK inhibitors, U0126 or PD96059, reduces NOTCH1 and HES1 gene expression. The combination of GSI with MEK inhibitor enhances the growth suppression promote by MAPK signaling inhibition in PTC cell proliferation.

Facilitating investigation of this issue is our finding that the transforming and inflammatory signals of RP3 can be functionally separated allowing us to study each in isolation. We generated several RP3 mutants ablated in; 1) transformative signaling due to mutation of a tyrosine residue (RP3Y588Fmutant) which prevents the binding of downstream adaptor proteins 2) inflammatory signaling through mutation of binding sites for TRAF2 and TRAF6. Transformation only RP3 mutants grew tumors in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, strengthening our hypothesis that the inflammatory component of RP3 is responsible for the benign nature of PTC.To assess the impact of inflammatory RP3 on the progression of different tumors, various thyroid and non-thyroid tumorigenic cell lines were transduced with MSCV_IRES_GFP_RP3 mutants and sorted for GFP expression. With highly immunogenic MC57G cells (C57BL/6 mice), the transforming only mutants developed tumors whereas wild type RP3 along with inflammatory only RP3 were rejected.

ATC patients with genomic alterations (GA) in TSC2, ALK, BRAF show occasional, limited benefit with targeted therapies. Methods', ' 90 ATC were studied by CGP to define the frequency of GA and opportunities for targeted therapy approaches in this devastating disease. DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections, and CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 579X for up to 315 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. GA included base substitutions, indels, amplifications, copy number alterations and fusions/rearrangements. R software used for all statistical analyses. Fishers exact test used for mutation frequency comparisons among age groups. Results', ' Median patient age was 65 (range 33-86), 50 patients were male. There was a mean of 4.2 Known Likely Variant (KLV) genomic alterations per case, range 1-11. Adding Variants of Undetermined Significance (VUS) mean was 12.9, range 5-27. The most common KLV-GA were p53 (66%), BRAF (34%), TERT (32%), CDKN2A (32%), NRAS (26%), CDKN2B (20%), NF2 (14.4%), PTEN (13.3%), PIK3CA (12.2%). There were 2 EGFR; 5 JAK2 and 29 GAin the promoter region of TERT. BRAF V600E and NRAS/HRAS alteration were entirely mutually exclusive, and one case demonstrated both BRAF V600E and KRAS. Co-occuring mutations were CDKN2A with p53 (p=0.04). Some GA were more frequent in patients greater than 70 yrs of age such as BRAF, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, JAK2; while others were more common in 50 yrs patients like PTEN, NRAS. VUS of possible interest were MLL2 (n=15), ARID1A (11), TSC2 (5), ALK(2).

        "Background":"['Tumor mutations are being used as predictive biomarkers of response, in order to select the most effective treatment for individual cancer patients. Currently, this is being done without sufficient characterization of relevant oncogene mutations as quantitative biomarkers. The goal of the current study was to define normal and pathological levels of the most prevalent hotspot mutations in the KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF genes, to establish the frequency with which the mutations occur as subpopulations, and what diagnostic sensitivity is needed to detect defined percentages of tumors carrying mutant subpopulations. Therefore, the sensitive Allele-specific Competitive Blocker-PCR (ACB-PCR) was used to quantify the levels of specific hotspot point mutations in a panel of normal human tissues and tumors. The mutations examined have established significance in terms of personalized cancer treatment, specifically KRAS G12D, KRAS G12V, BRAF V600E, and PIK3CA H1047R. The tissues examined included lung, colon, pancreas, and thyroid. In colon tumors, the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of KRAS G12D mutant fraction (MF) are 1.7 x 105, 7.4 x 105, 3.0 x 104, 2.8 x 102, and 8.4 x 101, respectively. In lung tumors, the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of KRAS G12V MF are 7.0 x 106, 1.1 x 105, 3.3 x 105, 2.3 x 102, and 1.2 x 101, respectively. Based on the data across these tissue types, 67.5% of tumors carry KRAS G12D or G12V mutation at a subpopulation frequency higher than that observed in normal tissue. Only 18.1% of tumors had a KRAS MF 101 (i.e., that detectable by DNA sequencing). From these data it was determined a diagnostic with a sensitivity of 102 or 103 would detect 27.7% or 43.4% of these tumors, respectively. Surprisingly, analysis of KRAS mutation in papillary thyroid tumors showed KRAS G12V mutations were present above normal thyroid levels, but as subpopulations in 42.1% of papillary thyroid tumors, even though the COSMIC database indicates this mutation occurs in only 0.15% of papillary thyroid tumors. The occurrence of these KRAS G12V mutations was positively correlated with percent tumor necrosis. For PIK3CA H1047R mutation in colon tumors, the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles are 1.2 x 106, 5.3 x 104, 7.6 x 104, 1.1 x 103, and 4.2 x 102, respectively. Data on BRAF V600E shows it occurs primarily as large subpopulations in papillary thyroid tumors. For effective development of personalized cancer treatment, quantitative and sensitive analyses of tumor mutations are needed to establish the effect of mutant subpopulations on patient response and/or relapse. Because so many tumors carry KRAS mutation, therapies targeting KRAS mutant cells are needed for use in conjunction with therapies directed against other targets.

        "Background":"['Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, aggressive and fatal cancer with a median survival of 3-5 months after diagnosis. Our long-term goal is to develop better therapies based on the biology of ATC that contributes to improved tumor response and a reduced risk of potential side-effects. We recently showed that the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member MCL1 is overexpressed in a subset of ATC and that targeting of MCL1 with quinacrine leads to increased sensitization to the BRAF inhibitor sorafenib. To further investigate the importance of BCL2 family proteins in ATC, we analyzed gene expression data from several published independent gene expression studies. We discovered that both papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and ATC surprisingly overexpress the mRNA of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member NOXA. However, despite the observed overexpression of NOXA mRNA in several ATC cell lines, we find that NOXA protein expression, by contrast, is low. NOXA protein has previously been shown to be subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Indeed, through bioinformatics, we find overexpression of several ubiquitin enzymes in ATC suggesting that the half-life of NOXA protein may be selectively reduced in this tumor type. We are further assessing differences in the turnover of NOXA protein in ATC cells and are investigating if restoring NOXA protein expression may synergize with the pharmacologic targeting of MCL1 and other anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members. Interestingly, through TCGA analysis, we discovered that BCL2 overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in thyroid cancer (THCA) patients. Indeed, treatment with the BCL2/BCLXL inhibitor navitoclax showed encouraging efficacy and synergized with the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 in the ATC cell line 8505C. This was based on the expectation that MLN4924 would rescue NOXA protein expression. We are pursuing mechanistic studies in a larger panel of thyroid cancer cell lines and in vivo efficacy and toxicity studies. We conclude that restoring NOXA protein expression can together with the rational targeting of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members may allow for the expansion of the limited ATC-selective treatment strategies currently available.']",

We studied the antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of LEN by using various thyroid cancer models.Methods', ' Roles of RTK signaling pathways in 11 thyroid cancer (differentiated (DTC), medullary (MTC), and anaplastic (ATC)) cells were examined by testing antiproliferative activity of selective RTK inhibitors. Mutation profiling of DTC cells was done by MassARRAY systems. Antitumor and antiangiogenic (immunohistochemical staining of the endothelial cell marker CD31) activity of LEN was tested in s.c. xenograft models. Phosphorylation of molecules in the FGFR1 and RET signaling pathways was evaluated through Western blotting (WB).

Thus, PI3K and AKT represent relevant targets for therapeutic purposes. However, the many essential of roles played by this pathway in normal cells poses the problem of reaching therapeutic efficacy without harming healthy tissues. In principle, it would be ideal to target only molecules directly involved in the transformation process, thus reducing the toxicity associated with wide-range inhibitors.PDK1 plays a key role in the PI3K cascade, directly activating AKT. In addition, PDK1 possesses a substrate docking site named PIF pocket that is required to phosphorylate and activate members of the AGC kinase family, including S6K, PKC, SGK, and RSK.Mice in which the PI3K pathway is constitutively activated in the thyroid epithelium through loss of Pten are born with thyroid hyperplasia that progresses to invasive and metastatic follicular carcinoma, a process that is accelerated by the simultaneous loss of p27 or p53, and by Ras or Braf activation.Using in vivo as well as ex vivo and in vitro genetic and pharmacological approaches, we now show that although Akt activation is necessary, it is not sufficient to transform thyroid epithelial cells. Concomitant activation of Pdk1-dependent pathways is absolutely required to develop neoplastic lesions in vivo, and to induce cell proliferation ex vivo. Pten mutants develop adenomas and carcinomas by one year of age. Strikingly, complete rescue of this phenotype is observed in compound mutants in which, in addition to thyroid-specific Pten loss, the PIF-pocket of Pdk1 has been genetically disrupted, maintaining constitutive activation of Akt and mTor, but not of PIF-pocket dependent AGC kinases.We also show that the transcription factor STAT3 represents a key mediator of this essential Pdk1-dependent pathway', ' STAT3 phosphorylation is increased in Pten mutants, and abolished in compound mutants. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 drastically impairs cell proliferation in vitro and rescues the hyperplastic phenotype of Pten mutant mice in vivo.Thus, we have identified an essential and druggable signaling cascade that critically cooperates with AKT activation to transform thyroid epithelial cells.']",

        "Background":"['EIF1AX (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A) is a component of the translation pre-initiation complex (PIC). Recurrent EIF1AX mutations, first reported in uveal melanomas, are found in 1% of papillary thyroid cancers in a mutually exclusive manner with other oncogenic driver events (BRAF, RAS, and oncogenic fusions). By contrast, they are enriched in advanced thyroid cancers (9% of anaplastic and 11% poorly-differentiated thyroid cancers), and are strongly associated with RAS mutations (p<0.0001). EIF1AX mutations cluster in the N-terminal (NTT) or C-terminal tails (CTT). EIF1AX NTT missense mutations in thyroid cancer occur within the first 15 amino acids, whereas the CTT mutation disrupts a splice acceptor site at exon 6 (A113splice). A113splice is the most prevalent defect and is private to this disease, and results in two differentially spliced mRNAs', ' (1) Cryptic splice variant', ' by use of a cryptic acceptor site in exon 6 that leads to a 132 AA protein that excludes 12 AA; (2) Truncated splice variant', ' by retaining intron 5, leading to a 115 AA truncated protein. EIF1AX mutants retain the ability to recruit the ternary complex, as shown by co-IP with EIF2 after ectopic expression of NTT or A113splice EIF1AX mutants in HEK293T cells, or after CRISPR-mediated knock-in of A113splice into Cal62 RAS-mutant thyroid cancer cells. The EIF1AX mutants had greater affinity to EIF5 compared to WT, consistent with a more stable PIC. As translation initiation is a rate-limiting step, the altered affinity of EIF1AX mutants to PIC components could impact the rate of protein synthesis. We tested this by L-azidohomoalanine labeling, which showed contrasting roles of the two A113-generated splice variants expressed at endogenous levels', ' i.e. the cryptic splice variant increased protein synthetic rate, whereas the truncated splice variant strongly inhibited protein translation. Despite inhibiting translation, the truncated splice variant showed a paradoxical increase in 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Upon A113splice knock-in, where both variants are expressed, translation is increased, which we hypothesize results from the combined effects of 4EBP1 phosphorylation, caused by relief of negative feedback events upstream in the pathway, with increased PIC assembly caused by the cryptic splice variant. We are currently determining whether the altered rate of protein synthesis is global or selective. Of note, cells expressing the cryptic, but not the truncated splice form, showed a transforming phenotype as assessed by soft agar colony formation. As EIF1AX mutations co-occur with RAS mutations in advanced thyroid cancers, it is likely that RAS-induced PI3K-AKT/mTOR signaling may provide a further cooperative benefit and play a key role in disease progression, and in generating specific tumor cell dependencies.']",

The underlying mechanism to the acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition involves c-Met-mediated reactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore combinatorial dual targeted therapy of BRAF and c-Met inhibition has shown to reverse EMT and show maximal antitumor effect.

The CD44-targetable NIRSHs were fabricated by polyplexing Cy5.5-conjugated polyethyleimine and hyaluronic acid in an aqueous medium. Ectopic xenograft mouse models were prepared by injecting 8505C cells at the flank of male athymic nude BALB/c mice, aged 6 weeks.

        "Background":"['Activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutations occur in 50% of melanoma, 45% of papillary thyroid cancer and 10% of colon cancer. BRAF inhibitors have elicited significant clinical response in melanomas but acquired resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Therefore, consideration of new treatment strategies to block activity of mutant BRAF and deter therapeutic resistance is warranted. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone required for the stability of hundreds of client proteins, including the RAF family of kinases, and has emerged as a highly relevant anticancer target. Ganetespib is a second generation, small molecule HSP90 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials. To investigate the potential for ganetespib in the treatment of melanoma we evaluated its preclinical activity as monotherapy, and in combination with targeted agents, in cells sensitive or resistant to BRAF inhibitors. Ganetespib displayed potent anticancer activity in a large panel of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma, thyroid and colon cancer cell lines, with IC50 between 4 and 40 nM. Further analysis showed that ganetespib disrupted oncogenic signaling by inducing the destabilization of mutant BRAF and subsequent inactivation of MEK and ERK. Levels of wild-type BRAF were only slightly reduced in response to ganetespib treatment, implying that the stability of activated BRAF is more reliant on HSP90 and that ganetespib may selectively deplete oncogenic forms of BRAF. Notably, ganetespib treatment also led to depletion of CRAF, which is implicated in driving therapeutic resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In an effort to maximize antitumor activity, we combined low levels of ganetespib with BRAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and observed increased cytotoxicity compared to single agent treatment. Both the BRAF and MEK inhibitors were cytostatic on their own, which may be due to continued PI3K/mTOR signaling. We subsequently assayed the combination of ganetespib with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and observed synergistic increases in cell death. Importantly, ganetespib was capable of blocking the feedback activation on MAPKK induced by a MEK inhibitor as well as the activation of ERK by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. To determine if these results translated in vivo, similar combinations were performed in BRAF mutant human melanoma xenografts. Co-administration of ganetespib with either a BRAF or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppressed in vivo tumor growth to a greater extent compared to monotherapy. Finally, we show that ganetespib effectively blocked MAPK signaling and killed RPMI-7951 melanoma cells (IC50 = 4 nM), which are resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors due to the overexpression of COT. In conclusion, targeting HSP90 with ganetespib represents a promising approach for the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-driven cancers and may be especially relevant in the context of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['BRAF is a human gene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signal pathway, which is important in regulating cellular responses to extracellular signals. Frequent mutations on BRAF gene have been detected in various types of human cancer, including malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, ovarian cancer and hairy cell leukemia. Among all, a single point 1799T>A (V600E) transversion, the most common mutation on BRAF, results in increased kinase activity. It serves as a driver mutation in several types of cancer and confers increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, detecting the BRAF V600E mutation may offer valuable information for cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Here we report a rapid, highly sensitive method for the detection of BRAF V600 mutation using a bridged nucleic acid (BNA) clamp technology associated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Due to the feature of enhanced affinity for hybridization template, BNA clamp is able to selectively block PCR reactions on the perfect match DNA sequence, while leaves the mismatch template unaffected. In this study several BNA clamps that bind to BRAF V600 wild-type (WT) template was designed, synthesized, and characterized. As compared to DNA clamp counterparts, these BNA clamps increased Tm values for the BRAF V600 WT by greater than 30C. In addition, BNA clamps efficiently distinguished BRAF WT (perfect match) from V600E (mismatch) templates (deltaTm >12C). In qPCR assays BNA clamps could suppress amplification of WT by >1,000-fold, while had little or no effects on the V600E mutant. Such BNA clamps allowed us to detect 1.0% or lower levels for the BRAF V600E mutant in a wild-type background. These results indicate that BNA clamp-based qPCR technology offers a new tool for rapid, sensitive detection of BRAF V600E mutation.

The mutant BRAFV600E protein is found in over 50% of melanomas and thyroid carcinomas, resulting in elevated kinase activity, increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling, and cell proliferation. Vemurafenib and PLX4720 were designed to selectively inhibit the BRAF kinase, and clinical trials of vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma have demonstrated a response rate of over 50% and an overall survival advantage over standard dacarbazine therapy. Approximately 20-30% of individuals treated with vemurafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) highlighting the importance of understanding toxicities associated with this drug. Paradoxical ERK activation in BRAF wild-type, RAS-mutant cells is thought to be the major mechanism by which this occurs, as evidenced by the presence of RAS mutations in 60% of such lesions. Methods', '  Using a combination of BRAF-wild-type cSCC cell lines, primary human keratinocytes, as well as a UV mouse model of cSCC and human cSCC samples, we identified novel effects of BRAFi on apoptosis. Results', '  Here we show an unexpected and novel effect of vemurafenib and PLX4720 in suppressing apoptosis through the inhibition of multiple off-target kinases. JNK signaling and apoptosis are suppressed in cSCC lesions arising in vemurafenib-treated patients as well as in irradiated mouse skin. This occurs independently of paradoxical ERK signaling and in the presence of MEK inhibitor. Treatment with PLX4720 greatly accelerates the development of UV-induced cSCC in mice without Ras mutations. Kinome screening identified ZAK and MKK4 (MEK4 / MAP2K4) kinases as inhibited by vemurafenib, leading to suppression of MKK4 and MKK7 (MAP2K7) phosphorylation. Knockdown of inhibited off-target kinases recapitulates these anti-apoptotic effects of vemurafenib. Conclusions', '  Our results implicate suppression of JNK signaling, independent of ERK activation, as an additional, complementary mechanism of adverse effects of vemurafenib. This has broad implications for combination therapies with other modalities that induce apoptosis and for the long-term use of vemurafenib in the adjuvant setting.']",

Whole exome sequencing of canine TCC tumors was performed to identify somatic mutations in known cancer driver and repressor genes that could potentially contribute to canine TCC pathogenesis. A valine to glutamic acid mutation in BRAF homologous to the activating V600E mutation identified in human melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancers was identified in 70% of sequenced tumors. Sensitivity to the BRAFV600E inhibitor Vemurafenib was tested in three BRAF mutant canine TCC cell lines (Bliley, Tyler1 and Tyler2) and two BRAF wild type canine TCC cell lines (Angus1 and Kinsey). All five canine TCC cell lines exhibited IC50s greater than 10μM, with BRAF mutant cell lines being slightly more sensitive. These sensitivity ranges are similar to those of some mutant human colorectal cancer cell lines, indicating that additional mechanisms may contribute to Vemurafenib resistance. Western blot analysis was performed to measure relative abundance of pERK, a downstream target of BRAF, in canine TCCs in response to serum starvation. All TCC cell lines showed sustained pERK expression in the absence of serum, indicating constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The five canine TCC lines were treated with 15μM Vemurafenib for 6 and 24 hours and their lysates were analyzed for pERK protein expression. pERK abundance was decreased in only the BRAF mutant cell lines after 6 hours of treatment. However, this decrease was less pronounced after 24 hours, suggesting that resistance mechanisms are bypassing BRAF to activate ERK. Sequence analysis of an additional panel of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine TCCs also revealed a mutation in RanBP2 in 31% of samples. Strikingly, the RanBP2 mutation appeared to be mutually exclusive to BRAF V to E mutant tumors with only two of the analyzed samples carrying both mutations. Significant tumor heterogeneity was implicated due to low level mutant amplification in these samples. It has been reported that loss of RanBP2 is synthetic lethal in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer. Since RanBP2 forms complexes with CRM1 at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear export and at the kinetochore during mitosis, canine TCC cell lines were treated with KPT-185, a CRM1 inhibitor. BRAF mutant TCC cell lines had IC50 values ranging from 45nM to 65nM and were approximately ten-fold more sensitive than wild type cell lines. Overall, this data indicates that the pathogenesis of canine TCC likely depends on driving factors in addition to constitutive BRAF signaling, but Vemurafenib resistant BRAF mutant tumors can be targeted through inhibition of the nucleopore complex.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' ATC is a rare thyroid cancer with a highly aggressive clinical course. Median OS is 3-4 months and 90% of patients die within 1 year of the diagnosis. There are no effective treatment options in metastatic disease. Targeted therapies to ALK and BRAF are occasionally associated with dramatic responses. Retinoblastoma (Rb) inhibits cell cycle progression and is inactivated by CDK 4/6, which is the target for ribociclib. Nearly all differentiated thyroid cancers are Rb negative, conversely nearly 100% of ATC expresses intact Rb which may be crucial for rapid cell cycle progression. Ribociclib is a CDK 4/6 inhibitors that slows cell cycle progression and DNA replication in tumors with functional Rb. The p16 protein similarly inhibits CDK4/6; if p16 levels are high Rb is phosphorylated and thus inactive. p16 is low in ATC, and from our comprehensive genomic analysis 30% of ATC lacks the p16 gene CDKN2a. Most ATC demonstrates PI3K/Akt/mTOR abnormalities, this pathway represents an attractive target in ATC. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown promising efficacy in ATC cell lines, especially in those with TSC2 mutation whose wild type negatively regulates mTOR. Methods', \" The combination of everolimus and ribociclib targets mutations/abnormalities that are frequently seen in ATC, and is tolerable based on Phase I/II trial results in the latest arm of the biomarker/oncogene driven ATC Master Protocol . This open-label trial treats metastatic Rb+ ATC patients with p16-/CDKN2a-. Treatment is ribociclib 400 mg + everolimus 5 mg QD. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate; secondary endpoints are PFS, OS, safety and toxicity. Exploratory objectives include if tissue biomarkers or mutations noted on Next Generation Sequencing correlate for enhanced/impaired response to combination therapy. Simon's two-stage design will be used with the null hypothesis that the true response rate is 5%, this will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the first stage, 9 patients will be accrued. If no response in these 9 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 21 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 30. Clinical trial information\", ' NCT02289144']",

        "Background":"['The serine-threonine protein kinase, BRAF, is a frequently mutated oncogene, found in cancers of the skin, thyroid and large intestine. It is especially prevalent in malignant melanoma, where it occurs in 40-60% of the cases. The most common BRAF mutation is the valine to glutamate substitution at position 600 of the kinase (V600E). This substitution, seen in ninety percent of the BRAF cases, leads to constitutive activation of the kinase, and the downstream MEK-ERK pathway. Appropriately, several drugs have been designed to inhibit BRAF, with a broad range of outcomes in clinical trials. Unfortunately, all patients, including those showing complete responses, develop resistance to single agent therapy. Our goal is to come up with effective drug combinations that would delay, or even prevent, the cancer from becoming resistant to treatment.We used a panel of 43 melanoma lines, comprising of 28 BRAF mutants, 12 NRAS mutants and 3 lines that were wild type for these two genes. Besides BRAF and NRAS, we have the mutational status of 65 other commonly mutated cancer genes for all the lines. We assembled a set of 25 drugs targeting a wide range of proteins, including PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, the apoptosis machinery, as well as some epigenetic modulators. The melanoma lines were treated with these drugs, either (i) alone or (ii) in combination with the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib or (iii) in combination with the MEK inhibitor Selumetinib, for 72 hrs over a nine point, 256-fold concentration range. Viability and apoptosis were measured using cell titer glo (Promega).The results from this pilot study are discussed here.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib (GSK2118436), selective BRAF inhibitors, and trametinib (GSK1120212), an allosteric MEK inhibitor, have shown robust clinical efficacy in melanoma patients 7-10. However, the majority of responses are transient and cellular resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation involving the downstream extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (reviewed in 11). We hypothesized that pathway blockade at ERK, the last signaling node prior to MAPK transcriptional programming, would not only be efficacious in MAPK-activated tumors but would also have utility in BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistant settings. We therefore sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of ERK. This report describes the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a potent and selective ATP competitive inhibitor of ERK1/2 which displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency on tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistant models as well as in the context of BRAF/MEK combination resistance. Together these data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors, not only in patients with MAPK activated tumors, but also in patients who have developed acquired resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors or resistance to the recently described combination of these agents.']",

An activating mutation of the BRAF serine/threonine protein kinase, BRAF V600E occurs in a proportion of malignant melanomas, and colorectal, thyroid, and other cancers. In hairy-cell leukemia (HCL), BRAF V600E is nearly always present, suggesting oncogene dependence. Methods', ' Here, we present a patient with HCL who was refractory to three lines of purine analogue-based treatment. The BRAF V600E mutation was demonstrated. After intensive counseling, the patient and his family provided written consent for vemurafenib (mutant BRAF-specific inhibitor) treatment. Results', ' Before vemurafenib treatment, the patient had subtotal bone marrow infiltration and massive splenomegaly (24.8 x 8.3 cm) leading to severe cytopenia (leukocytes 680/l, hemoglobin 10.0 g/dl, platelets 36.000/l). Treatment with vemurafenib was started with 240 mg twice daily and was slowly escalated to 1920 mg/d.  Within two days of treatment, the spleen softened and decreased in size. Serum CD25 (sCD25) level fell rapidly from 24.800 U/ml to normal levels (<900), and platelets, hemoglobin, and leukocyte counts rose. After 16 days of vemurafenib treatment, the spleen size had shrunk to 14 x 5 cm. By day 28 of treatment (on 720 mg/d), platelet counts and sCD25 levels had normalized. Bone marrow infiltration by HCL had decreased from 70% to 20% on day 16 and complete remission was achieved on day 35. We terminated treatment on day 57 when there was no evidence of any circulating hairy cells by immunophenotyping. Conclusions', ' The striking therapeutic activity of vemurafenib in our patient provides the first in vivo evidence to substantiate the BRAF V600E allele as a driver and validates mutant BRAF as a therapeutic target in HCL. Proof of principle for a molecularly targeted therapy of HCL adds to the recent success of targeting oncogenic kinases in oncogene addicted malignancies. Given the rarity of HCL, introducing new therapeutic modalities may be challenging. Future studies are needed that compare short-term inhibition of BRAF with low doses of vemurafenib (or alternative BRAF inhibitors) and standard therapy.']",

The V600E mutation is found in the vast majority of these cases and is an activating mutation, conferring transforming and immortalization potential to cells. CEP-32496 is a potent BRAF inhibitor that demonstrates selective anti-tumor activity against BRAFV600E mutated cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. CEP-32496 is orally bioavailable and demonstrates in vivo pharmacodynamic inhibition of pMEK and pERK signaling and tumor stasis and regressions in BRaf V600E cell line tumor xenograft models. In the current study Champions primary human TumorGraft models of melanoma and colorectal carcinoma possessing the B-Raf V600E genotype were utilized to determine the oral anti-tumor efficacy of CEP-32496 in more clinically relevant models in order to support the clinical development of CEP-32496. Champions Oncology has developed an innovative platform for oncology research that utilizes the implantation of primary human tumors in immune-deficient mice in a manner that preserves the biological properties of the original human tumor.

Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in colon, pancreatic, and lung cancers; BRAF mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant melanomas and from 40-60% of papillary thyroid cancers. MEK, a dual specific kinase, is a key player in this pathway; it is downstream of both Ras and Raf and activates ERK1/2 through phosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues. MEK162 (ARRY 438162) is a novel small molecule ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of the kinases MEK1 and MEK2. MEK162 showed promising data in an ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in patients with BRAF and NRAS mutated advanced melanoma. This is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS mutated melanoma. Methods and Results. The melanoma cell line panel was the most sensitive after investigating the growth inhibitory effect of MEK162 on 328 cancer cell lines from diverse histologies including melanoma, head and neck, colon, pancreas, lung, ovarian, liver, kidney, breast and endometrial. When a cutoff of IC50 <500nM or >70% Inhibition at 1uM after 6 days of culture was used 83% out of 47 melanoma cell lines were sensitive to the treatment with the MEK inhibitor. Sensitivity to MEK162 was independent of BRAFV600E andNRASQ61mutation status in this cell line panel. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed upon exposure to MEK162 using flow cytometry. MEK162 led to a G1 arrest and marked increase in apoptotic cells in the majority of the sensitive melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin and oncogenic driver mutations. Western blots were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to MEK162 in the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a decrease in pERK in all the cell lines tested regardless of their mutational status and the in vitro sensitivity. We observed an increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and wild type for NRAS and BRAF mutations cell lines than in BRAFV600Emutant cell lines. We found pAKT and pS6 decreased in the NRAS and BRAF mutant cell lines after treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of the mTOR pathway by MEK162 may be crucial for the sensitivity to the drug.

        "Background":"['Background', \" Molecularly targeted therapy across tumor types has great potential to benefit cancer patients. In order to validate the assays being used to identify actionable mutations of interest, controls that establish an assay's limit of detection are needed. 40-60% of melanomas harbor a mutation in proto-oncogene BRAF, resulting in constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway; driving growth, differentiation and metastasis. Metastatic melanoma patients have a poor prognosis; 5 year survival after diagnosis is only 15%. BRAF mutations are also found in lymphomas, colorectal, thyroid and lung cancers. This study was undertaken to develop reference materials for establishment of the lowest limits of detection for identification of the BRAF V600E mutation with the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation test, the THxIDTM BRAF kit, the Ion AmpliSeqTM Cancer Hotspot Panel. Reference materials with a limit of detection below 5% are useful for validation and identification of patient tumors with an extremely low percentage of the V600E mutation across multiple types of tumors.Methods\", ' Melanoma cells containing the V600E allele, the V600D allele and the wild type allele were mixed at a range of allelic ratios from 50 to 1% in Histogel and embedded in FFPE. Genomic DNA was extracted from macro-dissected cells in 10M FFPE sections and analyzed for quality and concentration using the KAPA Biosystems hgDNA Quantification and QC Kit. Quality scores (Q-ratios) generated with the kit may be used to predict the outcome of NGS library construction, with scores close to 1.0 being ideal for sequencing applications. Samples with Q scores close to 1.0, were subsequently tested on an ABI 7500 real time PCR system with the TrimGen BRAF V600 mutation kit. The extracted gDNA and unprocessed FFPE blocks and sections were then sent to diagnostic testing laboratories for analysis on the the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation test, the THxIDTM BRAF kit, and the Ion AmpliSeqTM Cancer Hotspot Panel.Results', ' We were able to isolate high quality and quantity (>700ng per 2 10M curls, Quality scores 1.0) gDNA suitable in fragment size and concentration for use in V600 companion diagnostic and NGS analysis from FFPE at a range of allelic ratios. Our 50% and 10% V600E mutant samples were detected by the TrimGen BRAF V600 mutation kit. Testing of mutations below 10% is currently ongoing on companion diagnostic and NGS platforms in clinical diagnostic laboratories.Conclusions', ' Prototype FFPE and extracted genomic DNA process controls were generated for use in NGS and companion diagnostics for BRAF V600. The advantage of this material is that it contains the mutation of clinical significance at well defined, consistent low levels, at and below the current minimum detectable mutant allele ratio of 10%. These reference controls may allow laboratories to verify assay detection limits, establish run to run reproducibility, and monitor testing quality over time.']",

We conducted parallel phase 1 dose escalation studies of the doublet of the BRAFi dabrafenib with the AKT inhibitor GSK2141795 and of the triplet of dabrafenib, the MEKi trametinib, and GSK2141795. Methods', ' Patients (pts) with BRAF-V600E/K mutant advanced solid tumors with adequate end-organ function were eligible regardless of prior BRAFi and MEKi exposure. All pts received dabrafenib at 150 mg twice daily (bid), in the doublet cohorts together with dose escalation (3 + 3 scheme) of GSK2141795 started at 50 mg daily (qd), and in the triplet cohorts with dose escalation of both trametinib starting at 1.5 mg qd and GSK2141795 starting at 25 mg qd. DLTs included significant grade 3 and 4 adverse events (CTCAE v4) within the first 56 days of treatment. Radiographic responses were assessed at 8-week intervals. Results', ' No DLTs were observed in the doublet cohorts (N = 8) up to dabrafenib 150 mg bid and GSK2141795 75 mg qd. In the triplet cohorts (N = 11), no DLTs were observed at doses of up to trametinib 1.5 mg daily with GSK2141795 75 mg daily. At the highest triplet dose with dabrafenib 150 mg bid, trametinib 2 mg qd with GSK2141795 75 mg qd, 1 of 2 evaluable pts had a DLT of grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 maculo-papular rash. 2/2 treatment-nave in the doublet cohorts had PRs (1 melanoma and 1 thyroid) the latter lasting over 1 year. 1/6 BRAF inhibitor-refractory (melanoma) pts also had an objective response. In the triplet cohorts, 3 of 6 treatment-nave pts had a PR (1 melanoma, 2 lung). One lung pt remains in PR at 2 months and the otherhas an uPR at 1.2 months. Conclusions', ' Inhibition of both MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways was well tolerated, leading to durable objective responses in pts with metastatic melanoma, thyroid cancer, and lung cancer. Further study of dual pathway inhibition is warranted.

Methods', ' Tumor tissues from patients with diverse cancers referred to the Phase I Program for targeted therapy from 10/08 to 05/10 were analyzed for PIK3CA, RAS (KRAS, NRAS), and RAF (BRAF) mutations using PCR-based DNA sequencing. Results', ' Overall, tumor tissues from 504 patients were analyzed', ' colorectal, n=103; ovarian, n=60; melanoma, n=55; head and neck, n=48; breast, n=29; endometrial, n=29; cervical, n=22; lung, n=22, soft-tissue sarcoma, n=17; thyroid, n=16; pancreatic cancer, n=11; and others, n=92. PIK3CA mutations were found in 54 (11%) of 504 patients tested. KRAS mutations were identified in 71 (19%) of 368 patients tested, NRAS mutations in 19 (9%) of 220 patients tested, and BRAF mutations in 32 (9%) of 362 patients tested. PIK3CA mutations were most frequent in squamous cells cervical (5/14, 36%), endometrial (7/29, 24%), breast (6/29, 21%), and colorectal cancers (17/103, 17%). KRAS mutations were most frequent in pancreatic (5/9, 56%), colorectal (47/95, 49%), and endometrial cancers (4/21, 19%). NRAS mutations were most frequent in melanomas (12/40, 30%), and endometrial cancers (2/8, 25%). BRAF mutations were most frequent in melanomas (23/52, 44%), and colorectal cancers (5/88, 6%). Irrespective of histology, PIK3CA mutations in comparison to wild-type PIK3CA were more frequently associated with simultaneous KRAS mutations (38% vs. 16% respectively; p=0.001) and simultaneous RAS/RAF (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) mutations (49% vs. 27% respectively; p=0.002). RAS and RAF mutations were usually mutually exclusive; however, there was an endometrial cancer patient with simultaneous KRAS and BRAF mutations and a patient with melanoma with simultaneous NRAS and BRAF mutations.

US incidence rates of these rare tumors range from 0.07 to 6.3 per 100,000, with BRAF V600E mutation frequency ranging from 3% in high-grade glioma to 90% in HCL. Therefore, the ROAR study is underway in pts with these 9 rare BRAF-mutant cancers to assess the safety and efficacy of D + T combination therapy. Methods', ' This international, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study (NCT02034110) uses a Bayesian hierarchical statistical design that increases study power by borrowing information across histology cohorts based on the emerging response rate. Enrollment for each of the 9 cohorts (up to 25 pts each) may be stopped early for futility or efficacy if various criteria occur based on accrued data. Pts with BRAF V600Emutant histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced disease with no available standard treatment options are eligible. Enrollment based on local BRAF V600E mutation results is permitted. Pts receive D (150 mg twice daily orally) and T (2 mg once daily orally) on a continuous dosing schedule until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death occurs. Responses are assessed every 8 weeks per tumor-specific response criteria while pts are on study treatment. The primary study endpoint is overall response rate by investigator assessment. Secondary objectives include duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Pharmacodynamic markers and quality of life will also be evaluated. If a histological cohort meets stopping criteria for early efficacy, an expansion cohort will be opened. This ongoing trial is currently recruiting pts at 48 centers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and South Korea. Clinical trial information', ' NCT02034110']",

We therefore performed a systematic screen for tyrosine kinase (TK) fusions in cases without known driver oncogenes by measuring aberrantly high RNA expression of kinase domain (KD) exons relative to more 5 exons.  Methods', '  We studied 74 patients whose lung ADC lacked mutations in KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, HER2, and ALK fusions. A NanoString-based assay was designed to query the transcripts of 90 TKs at two points', ' 5 to the KD and within or 3 to the KD. Tumor RNAs were hybridized to the NanoString probes and analyzed for outlier 3 to 5 expression ratios. The assay was validated on samples with known ALK and ROS fusions. Presumed novel fusion events were followed up by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and confirmatory RT-PCR.  Results', '  The NanoString assay identified aberrant 5 to 3 ratios in ROS and RET in 2 cases, respectively, out of 74. RACE analysis isolated a novel GOPC-ROS fusion in the former and a novel KIF5B-RET fusion in the latter, both confirmed by RT-PCR. Further screening by RT-PCR for KIF5B-RET identified one more positive sample in the study set that had not been detected by NanoString.  At the RNA level, both fusions joined exon 15 of KIF5B to exon 12 of RET, thus retaining a portion of the dimerization domain of KIF5B and the entire KD of RET, analogous to RET fusions in papillary thyroid carcinoma (TC). One KIF5B-RET patient was a 60 y.o. female never smoker, the other, a 73 y.o. male former smoker.  Conclusions', '  The novel KIF5B-RET fusion described here and also recently reported by Ju YS et al. (Genome Res, Dec 22, 2011) defines a new subset of lung ADC with a potentially targetable driver oncogene. Based on these genetic data and the preclinical activity of the RET inhibitor XL184 (Exelixis) in papillary TC and its known activity in medullary TC with RET mutations, we have initiated prospective testing for KIF5B-RET as part of our lung ADC screening panel in anticipation of a planned phase 2 trial with XL184 in patients with KIF5B-RET or related variant RET fusions.']",
