Defining the landscape of genetic alterations that participate in cancer transformation provides insight into the diversity of clinical responses observed to targeted treatments. Here, we identified concurrent mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressors TP53 and PTEN as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanomas harboring mutant V600EBRAF.Defects in TP53 function and PTEN loss occur in 17% and 12% of malignant melanomas respectively, rendering cells dependent on CHK1 to maintain normal cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that CHK1 inhibition increases sensitivity to a variety of alkylating agents and targeted therapies in V600EBRAF mutant, TP53/PTEN deficient cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Inhibition of CHK1 concurrently with the induction of either DNA damage or replication stress leads to mitotic catastrophe and cell death in our in vitro and in vivo models of TP53/PTEN deficient tumors. In the case of externally applied cellular stress from chemotherapeutics, our results suggest CHK1 inhibition may sensitise this genetically defined subset of melanomas to such treatments.Our results provide some insight into the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes observed when treating BRAF mutant melanomas with BRAF inhibitor and suggest a need for comprehensive screening of TP53 and PTEN inactivation in these patients.']",

Methods', ' Under an IRB-approved protocol clinical and pathological data were collected for a retrospective cohort of CM pts with clinical molecular testing performed by a next gene sequencing panel from April 2012 to November 2014.

Results', ' Among 929 CM pts, 43% had V600, 21% had NRAS, 19% had TP53 and 7% had NonV600 muts. TP53 muts were detected in 11% of pts with V600 muts, 19% of pts with NRAS muts and 29% of pts without V600 or NRAS muts (WT). NonV600 muts were detected in 1% of V600 pts, 4% of NRAS, and 15% of WT.

Pts with TP53 mut had longer overall survival (OS) from stage IV on univariate analysis (p = 0.04), and on multivariate analysis (p = 0.026) that included gender, stage, and LDH. Improved OS with TP53 mutation was not observed in pts with a V600 mut (p = 0.89), and TP53 mut was not associated with outcomes in V600 pts treated with approved BRAF inhibitors.

        "Background":"['Background', ' The BRAF gene is the most frequently mutated gene in malignant melanoma (MM). When mutated, it is associated with a more aggressive disease phenotype. Recently, intronic microRNA miR-3151 was identified in intron 1 of BAALC via deep-sequencing of MM samples. BAALC is reported to be the most upregulated gene in BRAF mutated melanoma. In acute myeloid leukemia, both high miR-3151 and BAALC are associated with poor survival. In addition, miR-3151 has direct leukemogenic activity via direct deregulation of TP53.Aims', \" To decipher miR-3151's role in MM carcinogenesis and to elucidate its relation with BRAF mutations.Methods/Results\", ' miR-3151 and TP53 expression levels were determined in MM patients (n=20). Indeed, patients with high miR-3151 had lower TP53 expression. To prove direct downregulation of TP53 by miR-3151, we stably expressed miR-3151 and antagomiR-3151 in MM cell lines (Mel-39, A375, MeWo). RT-PCR and Western blots confirmed downregulation of TP53 by forced miR-3151 expression and upregulation of TP53 by antagomiR-3151. Increased levels of miR-3151 led to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis by miR-3151, whereas antagomiR-3151 reduced cell growth and increased apoptosis. Concurrent Annexin/PI-staining revealed a reduction of cells in S and G2 phase in response to antagomiR-3151. Next, we determined the BRAF mutation status in the set of 20 MM patients and tested for a possible association with miR-3151 expression. BRAF mutated (BRAFmut) patients had a 5-fold higher miR-3151 expression compared to BRAF wild-type (BRAFwt) patients. To test whether BRAF mutations directly influence miR-3151, we performed si-mediated knock-down in BRAFmut cell lines (A375, Mel-39) and introduced the BRAF mutation into the BRAFwt cell line (MeWo) and then determined miR-3151 and TP53 expression. Silencing BRAF decreased miR-3151 expression and consequently increased TP53 expression, while introducing the BRAF mutation increased miR-3151 expression and decreased TP53 when compared to scramble control. Finally, as pharmacologic inhibition of aberrantly activated BRAF is a promising treatment approach for BRAFmut MM and as we had just identified miR-3151 as a downstream target of BRAF, we tested whether simultaneous knock-down of miR-3151 would add to the known effects of the BRAF inhibitor Zelboraf. The presence of antagomiR-3151 reduced the dose of Zelboraf required to achieve cell death by 60%.Summary / Conclusions', ' miR-3151 deregulates TP53 in MM patients, thereby increasing the proliferation of MM cell lines. AntagomiR-3151 reduced MM cell growth and increased apoptosis in vitro. High miR-3151 expression is associated with the presence of BRAF mutations in MM patients, which directly increases miR-3151 expression. Simultaneous treatment of BRAFmut cell lines with the BRAF inhibitor Zelboraf and antagomiR-3151 significantly reduced the IC50 of Zelboraf.']",

        "Background":"['Activation of CDK4 by amplification, increased expression of Cyclin D1 (CCND1) or reduced expression of the CDK inhibitor p16 (CDKN2A) can contribute to melanocyte transformation, indicating that CDK4 can act as an oncogene in melanoma. We have analyzed the frequency of gene copy number variations (CNV) in the CDK4 pathway and looked for associations of these alterations with patient survival to assess if CDK4 is a viable target for the treatment of human melanoma. In addition, we screened a panel of melanoma cells with a highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991) and performed gene expression and mutation analysis on these cells to explore possible genomic predictors of sensitivity.Genomic analysis revealed that 75% of primary melanomas had at least one CNV in the CDK4 pathway, with 55% showing a loss of CDKN2A. 28% of melanomas had two or more CNVs and melanomas with two or more CNVs involving CCND1 had worse overall survival (HR 5.56, P=0.02). From the cell line studies low CDKN2A mRNA expression, mutation or loss predicted sensitivity to PD-991 with 23 out of 27 mutant/loss cell lines being sensitive compared to only 3/7 wild type lines (p<0.03). Expression of CDK4, CCND1 or other cyclins or CDK-inhibitors did not predict sensitivity to PD-991. PD-991 induced an increase in both cell size and SA--galactosidase activity that is indicative of a senescent phenotype, and this was associated with cells having wild type p53. In summary, genomic alterations in the CDK4 pathway are frequent in melanoma and are associated with worse survival, particularly when melanomas harbor two or more CNVs involving CCND1. CDK4 inhibition induces a senescent phenotype in melanoma cells that is associated with loss of CDKN2A and wild type TP53. Taken together these data support evaluation of CDK4 inhibitors in melanoma and suggest that CDKN2A and TP53 maybe genomic predictors of sensitivity.']",

        "Background":"['Despite the prevalence of recurrent, high activating BRAF V600 mutations in 45% of tumors, cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a heterogeneous malignancy resulting from aberrant signaling in multiple pathways. It has been traditionally characterized by activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as cell cycle disruption. In recent years, whole-genome and exome sequencing studies have identified several new genes associated with melanomagenesis. However, a comprehensive understanding of concurrent, and mutually exclusive, mutations in tumors is currently lacking. Using a custom targeted capture of 108 genes previously implicated in melanoma pathogenesis, massively parallel sequencing was performed on 94 human melanoma cell lines, 67 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and 5 cell lines made from PDX, all untreated. Samples were then clustered into groups based on deleterious mutations. 83% of samples had deleterious mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including 92 high activity BRAF (55%), 35 RAS codon 61 (21%), 7 with multiple mutations (e.g. low activity BRAF/RAS codons 12/13) (4%) and 10 NF1 (6%) mutated samples. Likely deleterious NF1 mutations were found in several BRAF or NRAS-mutated samples. PI3K pathway mutations were found in 10% of samples, predominantly associated with BRAF mutations. TP53 mutations were found in 24% of samples and were associated with all MAPK signaling mutations. Mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A/1B, ARID2, TRRAP, and BAP1) were mutually exclusive with each other and primarily found in tumors with high activity BRAF or NRAS mutations. The majority of BRAF or RAS-mutated samples with a mutation in a chromatin remodeling gene lacked mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and PI3K signaling genes; however, 100% of deleterious, or likely deleterious, NF1-mutated samples with a chromatin remodeling gene mutation harbored additional mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and/or PI3K signaling genes. Of particular interest, five of the 10 NF1-mutated samples (50%) lacked BRAF, RAS, and MEK1/2 mutations but harbored likely deleterious mutations in MAP3K5 or MAP3K9, suggesting the potential involvement of the JNK signal transduction pathway in this particular cohort. Only 4% of samples did not have a deleterious mutation in any of the genes on the panel. These data reveal novel insights into the genetics of melanomas lacking a canonical BRAF V600 mutation. Functional assays are needed to confirm the biological relevance of likely deleterious mutations, which will further facilitate a more thorough classification of CM subsets.']",

        "Background":"['The pathogenic mutations in melanoma have largely been catalogued, but the order of their occurrence is not known. We identified 82 cases of melanocytic neoplasia with two or more histopathologically distinct precursor and descendent portions. These portions spanned several histopathologic stages including benign nevi, intermediate neoplasms such as dysplastic nevi, melanoma in situ, invasive melanoma, and metastatic melanoma. In total, 277 histopathogically distinct areas were microdissected and sequenced using a panel of several hundred cancer-genes at an average of 275-fold coverage. In all cases precursor lesions harbored mutations known to activate the MAPK pathway, most commonly affecting BRAF or NRAS, and thus these were considered initiating mutations. TERT promoter mutations were the earliest secondary mutations to occur, emerging in intermediate neoplasms and in situ melanomas. Bi-allelic CDKN2A mutations and/or deletions arose predominantly at the transition to invasive melanoma. TP53 and PTEN mutations occurred comparatively later in thicker primary melanomas. In the 12 cases in which matched primaries and metastases were sequenced, no pathogenic mutations were specifically associated with the transition to metastatic melanoma, suggesting that metastatic capability was already present in the primary tumors. Unequivocally benign neoplasms, which mostly consisted of conventional nevi, disproportionately harbored BRAFV600E mutations as the only apparent pathogenic alteration. Lesions that were histopathologically intermediate, such as dysplastic nevi, had two or more pathogenic mutations and were enriched for NRAS mutations. These findings provide genetic support for the existence of an intermediate stage of melanocytic neoplasia, resolving a long-standing controversy. We also found that melanomas with different initiating mutations evolve through distinct evolutionary trajectories linked to specific histopathologic precursors. A mutational signature of UV-radiation-induced DNA damage predominated in lesions from all histopathologic stages, implicating UV-radiation in both the initiation and progression of melanoma. The point mutation burden increased steadily from one progression stage to the next, stabilizing once melanomas became invasive. By contrast, copy number alterations only became prevalent at the transition to invasive melanoma. Melanomas evolve from benign lesions linearly, whereas, they show patterns of branched evolution when they evolve from intermediate lesions; this indicates that evolution may accelerate once a melanocytic neoplasm reaches an intermediate stage. In summary, our study outlines a framework of the genetic evolution of melanocytic neoplasms from precursor lesions and unveils the rate-limiting homeostatic factors that become disrupted as neoplasms progress from one stage to the next, as well as the pathogenic factors driving this evolution.']",

More importantly, the toxicity and financial burden of receiving such therapy warrants a personalized, or precision medicine, approach to appropriate selection of treatment, thus molecular predictors of response may become as important as biomarkers such as PDL1 expression. Recently the high mutational burden of malignant melanoma was shown to be related to the degree of response to the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab, but mutational burden alone was not sufficient to predict benefit1. Another study has shown NRAS-mutant had a trend to superior outcomes compared with other cohorts in terms of response to therapy with anti-PD1 antibodies and progression-free survival2. Moreover, insight into the molecular evolution of melanoma was recently established3, wherein somatic mutations in oncogenes such as BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, or GNA11 occur early during progression and additional mutations of TERT, CDKN2A, TP53, and PTEN are seen in late-stage disease. To better evaluate the relationship of these mutations to immunotherapy response, our institution has profiled 95 patients with melanoma with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Of the 95 patients profiled, the most common mutations identified were BRAF (38%), NRAS (21%), TP53 (18%), PTEN (14%), TERT (9%), and CDKN2A (8%).

Studies from our laboratory showed its chemopreventive effects in a UVB-induced skin cancer model, as well as in vitro pro-apoptotic effects in A431 squamous cancer cells, UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 human melanoma cell lines. In this study, the antineoplastic effects of honokiol were evaluated in vivo against the malignant melanoma cell lines UACC-62 that harbors mutated BRAF, CDK4i, PTEN and SKMEL-2 cells that presents NRAF, and TP53 mutated genes.The present study investigated the mechanism of honokiol-induced antitumoral effects in human melanoma UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 cells in two xenograft melanoma models in mice.UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 melanoma cells were subcutaneously grafted in nude mice, treatment groups received honokiol 50 mg/kg thrice a week and tumor growth was followed. After five to seven weeks, animals were euthanized and tumor tissue collected for gene profiling and western blots. The genetic expression of apoptotic biomarkers was assessed by qRT-PCR by using PCR arrays for the apoptotic pathway (SABiosciences, CA).After subcutaneous grafting of UACC-62 or SKMEL-2 human melanoma cells in the nude mice, the intraperitoneal administration of honokiol at 50 mg/kg body weight for five to seven weeks caused a significant reduction of tumor growth. Honokiol activated the apoptotic pathway in UACC-62 cells xenograft tumors in mice, as attested by the significant up-regulation of BAK1, BAX, CARD8, CASP10, CASP2, CASP6, CASP7, FADD, TNFRSF10B, TNFRSF25, TP53 and TP53BP2 transcripts. In the western blots from the UACC-62 cells tumors, there was an increase in the expression of CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, CASP6, cleaved CASP6 and CASP10 proteins in the honokiol treated group. In the tumors originated from the SKMEL-2 melanoma cells, a significant up-regulation of BAD, BAK1, BAX, NOD1, CARD6, CASP7, FADD, TNFRSF21 and TRAF3 transcripts was observed. The activation of the apoptotic pathway in the SKMEL-2 cells tumors by honokiol was further confirmed by western blots in the tumor lysates, where it was observed an increase in the activation of caspases and cleavage of PARP in the honokiol treated animals.Honokiol treatment exerted significant antitumor effects, including the activation of the apoptotic signaling pathway in UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 human melanoma cells in xenograft tumors in mice.

The heterogeneity and the invasiveness of melanomas present notable challenges for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, several mutations in RAF, RAS, and PTEN were identified that allow for prognosis of cancer development and progression. Therefore, inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway form attractive candidates for molecular-based targeted treatment of melanoma cancer. Here, we present the molecular characterization and chemosensitivity profiling of 18 human melanoma cell lines. Eight of these were established by Oncotest from human tumor xenografts originally derived from primary patient material. The molecular profiling included mutational analysis for BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and PTEN by sequencing. The chemosensitivity profiles were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and included commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of melanoma, targeted agents (sorafenib and bortezomib) and various BRAF (PLX-4032, PLX-4720, GDC-0879) and MEK (CI-1040, PD0325901) inhibitors. The clinically relevant BRAF V600E substitution was the most prevalent mutation and was found in more than 50% of the melanoma cell lines. The chemosensitivity profiling revealed diverse patterns of selectivity and potency with mean IC50 values between 0.4 nM (vinblastine) and 8.3 M (carboplatin). Each of the BRAF inhibitors tested was clearly more active in melanoma cell lines carrying a BRAF mutation. On average, IC50 values of BRAF inhibitors were more than 20-fold lower for the BRAF V600E mutated cell lines compared to the wild type cell lines. However, the BRAF mutated cell line MEXF 462NL was resistant towards BRAF inhibitors and it is warranted to compare its gene expression profile and mutational status with BRAF mutated cell lines responding to BRAF inhibitors. By using an ex vivo clonogenic assay, similar activity patterns for BRAF inhibitors were found, with mutated BRAF tumor xenografts showing markedly higher sensitivity. Potential synergistic activity of BRAF inhibitors with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or with standard chemotherapeutic agents will be presented. The mutational status of selected cancer related genes, as well as responsiveness towards many cytotoxic and targeted agents was analyzed for 18 melanoma cell lines. This extensive genotypic and phenotypic characterization makes this melanoma cell line panel a valuable tool for in vitro profiling of novel compounds, in particular inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway.']",

Extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of this novel scaffold showed that the best analog in this series, ABI-231, has an average IC50 = 5.2 nM against panels of melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines, is orally bioavailable, and strongly suppress melanoma tumors in vivo. Analyses of the potential binding pose of ABI-231 at the colchicine binding pocket suggested small substitutions to the indole moiety in ABI-231 could further increase its interactions to tubulin.Based this hypothesis, we have established an efficient synthetic method for the synthesis of ABI-231 analogs by either rotating the indole ring or introducing substituents on the indole of ABI-231. Using this method, we synthesized and tested 27 analogs of ABI-231. Several of the compounds show excellent potency against a panel of melanoma cancer cell lines with a diverse genomic background (mutations in BRAF, TP53, CDKN2A and PTEN) that are frequently encountered in clinical metastatic melanoma tumors. Additionally, they are not substrates for the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux pump and therefore strongly inhibited the multidrug resistant cell lines. The potency of the compounds was further verified by their potent growth inhibition of cancer cell colonies. Results from cell cycle analysis, apoptosis evaluation and tubulin polymerization inhibition are consistent with their expected mechanisms of action. Potential off-target analyses performed by Eurofins Cerep-Panlabs SafetyScreen 44 indicated that they are clean and does not inihibt any of the tested off-targets at 100 fold of its IC50 value in melanoma cells, suggesting the good safety profile for this compound and the probably these scaffold in general.

In contrast to the majority of human tumors which harbour p53 mutations, melanomas preferentially have BRAF V600E or NRAS(Q61K) mutations accompanied by dysfunction of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which may help progression from nevi to invasive melanoma. Although ultraviolet radiation accelerates BRAF-driven melanomagenesis by targeting TP53 (Viros A. et al, Nature. 2014;511', '478-82), some evidences for an anomalous wt p53 response to radiation in melanomas are a dysfunctional pro-apoptotic DNA damage response which can be enhanced by radiation sensitizers like halogenated pyrimidines (Rieber M, Rieber MS.Cancer Biol Ther. 2008;7', '1561-6), and a report that p53 knockdown in melanoma cells resulted in decreased proliferation (Avery-Kiejda KA1, Bowden NA, Croft AJ, Scurr LL, Kairupan CF, Ashton KA, Talseth-Palmer BA, Rizos H, Zhang XD, Scott RJ, Hersey P.BMC Cancer. 2011;11', '203) .PURPOSE. Since activation of AMPK by AMP inhibits ATP-consuming metabolic pathways during metabolic stress which may cause autophagy, we investigated the possible role of melanoma p53 status in modulating response to AMPK activators and autophagy inhibitors, in physiological 5mM glucose. EXPERIMENTAL. Genetically-matched NRAS-mutant human melanoma cells with unequal p53 mutational status were exposed to different glucose levels in the presence of AMPK inducers including autophagy modulators. Formation of autophagic vesicles were quantitated by cytometric red/gree acridine orange fluorescence Apoptosis-associated PARP cleavage was studied by specific immune blotting. RESULTS. AMPK induction in response to AICAR was greater than that of metformin and was increased in mutant p53 cells, which also showed greater resistance to autophagy inhibition. Greater AMPK activation correlated with increased lysosomal acidification in mutant p53 cells. CONCLUSIONS. Our results identify a role for a) p53 dysfunction in enhancing the response to AMPK activators and autophagy to favour tumor cell survival, b) autophagy inhibitors in counteracting pro-survival AMPK signaling.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is one of the few cancer types where p53 is not often mutated. Cancers which have not mutated TP53, often attenuate p53 activity by affecting upstream regulators or downstream effectors of p53. As melanoma progresses, it by passes senescence, proliferates, and switches from a proliferative phenotype to a more invasive phenotype. We have found that invasive melanomas, characterized by high levels of the pro-invasive Wnt molecule, Wnt5A, express active p53. Conversely, melanomas with a more proliferative phenotype, characterized by increased MITF signaling and low Wnt5A expression, do not express active p53. We show that the expression of p53 appears to be controlled by Wnt5A, and this may occur via CAMKII. By Western blot, we have observed that more proliferative melanoma cells express a high molecular weight p53 (250 kDa). This high molecular weight p53 does not break down on an SDS-PAGE gel. Knocking down p53 in proliferative and invasive melanoma cells, using siRNA, decreases the high molecular weight band in the proliferative cells, and the 53 kDa band in the more invasive cells. When we over express HA-tagged p53 in proliferative cells, we see multiple bands for p53 by Western blot, including the high molecular weight bands, suggesting that p53 is being post-translationally modified in these cells. We confirmed that ubiquitination is involved in the formation of the high molecular weight p53, by treating proliferative cells with SMER3, an E3 ligase inhibitor. Following two hours of treatment, the high molecular weight p53 band decreased and this decrease persists for 16 h. Next, we transfected an E6 ligase into invasive melanoma cells, which express active p53. Expression of the E6 ligase increased the expression of the high molecular weight p53 band (250 kDa), but these cells also continued to express active p53 (53 kDa). To determine if ubiquitination is targeting p53 for degradation in proliferative cells, we treated invasive and proliferative cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Following treatment with MG132, p53 (53 kDa) increased in invasive cells, suggesting that p53 is degraded via the proteasome in these cells. However, when we treated proliferative cells with MG132 we did not see an increase in the high molecular weight band, suggesting that p53 is not being degraded via the proteasome in these cells. By immunofluorescence, we found that p53 is in the cytoplasm of proliferative cells, suggesting that ubiquitination may be playing a role in sequestration of p53 in proliferative cells. In invasive cells, p53 remains largely nuclear, and we demonstrate that this plays critical roles in response to therapy, counter-intuitively driving resistance, by allowing cells to undergo an adaptive stress response that we term pseudosenescence']",

        "Background":"['Desmoplastic melanomas (DMs) comprise 4% of the overall melanoma burden and have a 5-year survival rate of 85%. DMs are dermal tumors characterized by spindled melanocytes situated within abundant desomplastic stroma. These unusual histological features commonly lead to misdiagnosis. Currently, there are no known genetic drivers. A better understanding of the underlying biology of desmoplastic melanoma would provide biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities. Towards this goal, we performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 DMs in a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 candidate genes on a validation cohort of 42 cases. Additionally, high-resolution aCGH was performed on samples from both cohorts. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers sequenced to date. Mutation patterns strongly indicate that UV-radiation is the dominant mutagen and implicate a superficially located cell of origin despite their predominantly intradermal presentation. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations and amplification of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, NFKBIE (IkB) in 14.5% of samples. The promoter mutations typically affect both alleles and occur over a highly conserved DNA region. The mutations are predicted to disrupt a canonical Ets Like Factor 1 (ELF1) binding site. In total, these data imply aberrant NF-kappa B signaling as a pathogenic feature of desmoplastic melanoma. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/R, were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Rb and p53 pathway alterations occurred respectively in 71% and 66% of tumors, affecting RB1, FBXW7, CDK4, PPP6C, CCND1, CDKN2A, TP53, and MDM2. Finally, TERT promoter mutations or amplifications occurred in 90% of tumors. The consequences of the mutations on protein expression levels was confirmed by immunostaining for NF1, EGFR, Rb, CDK4, CCND1, p16, p53, and Mdm2. Collectively, many of these oncogenic mutations are potentially druggable. In conclusion, desmoplastic melanomas harbor distinct genetic alterations that explain their unique biology, and this study illuminates genetic biomarkers and nominates targets for therapeutic intervention.']",

Honokiol treatment significantly reduced (p<0.05) tumor volumes in both xenograft experiments. No evident signs of toxicity were observed in the honokiol treated animals. In both cell lines, honokiol significantly decreased (p<0.05) cell viability and proliferation, honokiol caused cell cycle arrest in Go/G1 phase in UACC-62 cell line, while it caused accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase in SKMEL-2 cell line; honokiol significantly increased the DNA fragmentation in both cell lines. Honokiol strongly decreased the expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin D2 and cyclin B1 while increasing the cleavage of caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 and PARP in both cell lines. In UACC-62 honokiol decreased the expressions of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin E, cdc2p34 and p21. In SKMEL-2, honokiol decreased the expression of CDK4, PCNA and increased the expression of p21. These findings suggest that honokiol is a good candidate for further studies as a treatment for malignant melanoma.

In addition, the cancer incidence for members of families meeting the clinical diagnostic criteria of LFS or Li-Fraumeni like (LFL) syndrome but in which no TP53 mutation has been identified (TP53- families) has not been established.Methods', \" The NCI's LFS Study (NCT01443468) is a natural history study that opened to accrual in August 2011. Inclusion criteria include LFS or LFL syndrome; a germline TP53 mutation; or a personal history of choroid plexus carcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), or 3 primary cancers. Participants complete a detailed family history and individual information questionnaires. Confirmation of all reported cancer diagnoses is pursued.Results\", ' Of the 122 families enrolled to date, 95 families have a germline TP53 mutation (TP53+ families) and 27 are TP53-families.TP53+ families', ' 243 mutation carriers from 95 mutation-positive families were included in the cancer risk estimates. The cumulative risk to first cancer diagnosis for the entire group is 43% by age 30 and close to 100 by age 70, with males having higher risk in childhood adolescence and females having higher risk starting in the 20s, mostly due to breast cancer. When examined by cancer type, the cumulative risk to age 70 is 35% for breast cancer, 16% for soft tissue sarcoma, 10% for brain cancer, 7% for bone cancer, 2% for leukemia, 2% for ACC, and 26% for others.

        "Background":"['The contribution ultraviolet radiation (UVR) makes to genetically distinct melanoma subtypes is unclear. Melanoma driven by oncogenic BRAF or oncogenic NRAS differ in their epidemiological, clinicopathological and genetic features. NRAS melanoma in humans occurs in older individuals and presents at sites most exposed to UVR damage such as the head and neck.In this study we show excessive sun exposure and NRAS-driven melanoma can co-occur by juxtaposing the epidemiological, clinical and genetic characteristics of a G12DNRAS-driven human melanoma case subject to extreme UVR exposure. To model the interaction of UVR with specific oncogenes and mimic human disease, we used mouse melanoma models driven by V600EBRAF or G12DNRAS. We previously reported that UVR cooperates with V600EBRAF by targeting the tumour suppressor TP53. In this study we confirm that UVR cooperates with G12DNRAS to drive melanoma and, as observed in humans, murine UVR-G12DNRAS melanoma occurs in older animals that accumulate higher lifetime exposure to UVR. Furthermore, we find murine UVR-G12DNRAS melanomas are histologically and genetically heterogeneous, and distinct to UVR-V600EBRAF murine and human melanomas. UVR-G12DNRAS melanomas present more UVR-induced mutations, a longer latency to tumour development and secondary driver mutations distinct from UVR-V600EBRAF melanoma. We investigated whether UVR cooperates equally with other RAS isoforms, and exposed G12DKRAS animals to UVR. These animals presented a different latency to melanoma development and specific cooperating secondary targets distinct from UVR-V600EBRAF and UVR- G12DNRAS. This implies that different RAS isoforms activate oncogenic pathways differently. Critically, UVR-V600EBRAF, UVR-G12DNRAS, UVR-G12DKRAS tumors present similar mutation rates when UVR exposure is held constant, which suggests that the differences in tumour latency might be explained if melanomas driven by different oncogenes require varying numbers of subsequent co-operators.Finally, we present preclinical evidence showing how targeting the UVR-induced mutations found in the long tail of UVR-related mutations in NRAS melanoma can provide therapeutic options for NRAS mutant melanoma patients.The insight gained begins to provide a molecular explanation for distinct associations between UVR and individual oncogenes in melanomagenesis, and we show how UVR-induced damage can be exploited to stratify patients for personalised therapy approaches.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Contribution of heterozygous loss of ribosomal protein L5 as general tumor suppressor in cancer.",
        "Background":"['The association between ribosome defects and cancer became clear with the recent discovery of somatic mutations in ribosomal protein genes in several cancers, such as lymphoid leukemia’s and glioblastoma (Nat Genet. 2013 Feb;45(2)', '186-90 & Blood. 2016 Feb 25;127(8)', '1007-16 & Nature. 2014 Jan 23;505(7484)', '495-501). To further delineate the role of ribosomal proteins in human cancer, we systematically screened the TCGA database for genetic lesions in ribosomal protein genes, confirmed the contributing capacity of the most common somatic ribosomal protein defect in cancer pathogenesis by molecular interference, and explored the mode of action of this ribosomal protein defect. Systematic analysis of TCGA mutation and copy number data of respectively 4926 and 7322 patients representing 16 cancer types for defects in all 81 ribosomal protein genes. After stringent filtering, six ribosomal protein encoding genes (RPL5, RPL11, RPL23A, RPS5, RPS20 and RPSA) were significantly altered and identified as candidate cancer driver genes. RPL5 was located at a significant peak of heterozygous deletion on chromosome 1p22 and showed significant mutations and deletions in 11% of glioblastoma (GBM), 28% of melanoma, 34% of breast cancer (BRCA), and in 20% of multiple myeloma cases, thereby supporting heterozygous RPL5 inactivation to be the most common somatic ribosomal protein defect in human cancer. Human specific RPL5 doxycycline inducible knockdown (sh-hRPL5) in TP53 WT and TP53 mutant human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) and in a TP53 mutant human glioblastoma cell line (U-118 MG) proved that RPL5 knockdown accelerated in vivo tumor progression in NSG mice. This acceleration was associated with reduced phosphorylation of CDK1tyr15, which is required for cell cycle progression from G2 to mitosis. Whereas RPL5 has been implicated in TP53 and MYC regulation, no consistent effects of RPL5 downregulation on these proteins could be detected in TP53 WT and TP53 homozygous R280K mutant breast cancer models (sh-hRPL5). Interestingly, partial RPL5 inactivation was found to be associated with PTEN protein suppression in these tumors. This observation was confirmed in various cell models; in normal mouse neural stem/progenitor cells and mouse bone marrow cells (RPL5+/lox by INFβ and poly I', 'C), and also in GBM cancer pre-disposition mouse neural stem/progenitor cell model (sh-mRPL5 TP53 -/-). RPL5 downregulation also accelerated tumor formation in the PTEN deficient GBM cell line U-118 MG, underscoring undefined PTEN-independent mechanisms of RPL5. Overall, we identified RPL5 as a new tumor suppressor that shows heterozygous inactivation in 11-34% of multiple human cancer types. Partial molecular inactivation of RPL5 supported a tumor suppressor function for RPL5 in accelerating breast cancer and glioblastoma progression in vivo, which may be, in part, due to a new function of RPL5 in regulating PTEN.']",

For the current study, we expressed various EP53 proteins in human cancer cells with different p53 status, including osteosarcoma (U2-OS, Saos-2), glioblastoma (T98G), and breast cancer (MCF7). Western blot analysis confirmed EP53 expression. We compared apoptosis in the human cancer cells transfected/transduced with negative control vectors vs. epitope or protein-tagged EP53 exposed to doxorubicin (to induce DNA damage). Apoptosis was measured by cell viability, caspase activity, Propidium Iodide/Annexin V staining, and fluorescence microscopy. We observed a significant increase in caspase activity (normalized to cell viability) of U2-OS and T98G cells expressing EP53 compared to negative control treated cells as shown in Table 1, and apoptosis with p21 restoration in Saos-2. In U2-OS, which overexpress MDM2, EP53 was more effective at inducing apoptosis compared to human TP53. Taken together, we found that EP53-anc restored p53-mediated apoptosis and EP53-anc / EP53-retro9 enhanced p53-mediated apoptosis. These data suggest for the first time that EP53 functions in human cancer cells to promote cell death. Ongoing efforts are exploring the EP53 mechanism of action that leads to increased apoptosis, including expression of EP53 in additional cancer types (lung, melanoma, colon, prostate, and others) with a variety of genetic backgrounds to characterize its functional context.

Genes carrying driver mutations are detected in whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies if their non-synonymous mutations are significantly more frequent than their silent mutations, adjusting for the heterogeneous mutation rates across genomic locations, subjects and mutation types. Typical tumor WES studies (100-300 tumor samples) lack statistical power, and thus can identify only small numbers of candidate driver genes and possibly miss the well-established ones. The best algorithm to detect driver genes to date is MutSigCV. For each target gene, MutSigCV identifies its bagel, a set of genes predicted to have similar background mutation rates to the target gene and use the bagels to estimate the background mutation rate. Based on the identified bagels, we developed a novel statistical method implementing a series of algorithms to improve the statistical power while maintaining the type-I error rate. First, we developed a statistical framework for testing the selective growth advantage of each mutation type and appropriately integrating evidence of growth advantage across mutation types to achieve robust power. We then extended the algorithm to consider spatial clustering information. This substantially improves the statistical power when non-silent mutations are clustered into a few short regions or nucleotides. We applied this novel method to TCGA melanoma WES including 271 tumor samples. Without modeling spatial clustering information, over 30 candidate driver genes, including BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, PPP6C and CDKN2A were detected controlling FDR=0.01. Modeling spatial information of somatic mutations detected additional rarely mutated genes, including DISP1 (P=1.310-20, involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation that leads to normal development of embryonic structures), IDH1 (P=1.010-8, previously identified in relation to gliobalstoma and acute myeloid leukemia), MAP2K1 (P=510-18, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases that also include BRAF, MEK and other important players in melanoma), INTS8 (P=7.710-15, an integrator of small nuclear RNA processing), and STK19 (P=1.210-10, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, previously identified in melanoma).

The range in mutation positivity is likely due to heterogeneity of the studied patient populations.   Methods', '  We performed targeted, massively parallel sequencing of 795 BRCA1/2 negative BC patients in a research laboratory and analyzed 18 cancer susceptibility genes.Three high risk groups were studied', ' multiple primary cancers (MP, n = 315), early onset breast cancer (EOBC, n = 323), and familial breast cancer (FBC, n = 415).  MP was defined as at least one BC and at least one other primary malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, EOBC was defined as BC under age 40, and FBC was defined as at least three first to third degree relatives with BC under age 75.   Results', '  Overall, 78 patients (10%) were found to have a deleterious mutation. Mutations were found most commonly in CHEK2 (n = 32, 4.0%), ATM (n = 14, 1.8%), TP53 (n = 10, 1.3%), and MSH6 (n = 4, 0.5%).  One to two patients each had deleterious mutations in BARD1, BRIP1, CDKN2A, MRE11A, MSH2, NBN, PALB2, PTEN, PMS2, and RAD50; no mutations were identified in CDH1, MLH1, or STK11.  Deleterious mutations were more common in MP patients versus FBC patients without MP (12% versus 7%, p = 0.04) but not EOBC patients without MP (10%, p = NS).  CHEK2 and MSH6 mutations were more common in MP versus non-MP patients (6% vs 3% and 1.3% vs none, respectively, p = 0.05) whereas ATM mutations were more common in non-MP patients (0.6% vs 2.5%, p = 0.05).  The most common cancers in mutation carriers were a second primary breast cancer, sarcoma, melanoma, hematological malignancies, ovarian, thyroid and uterine cancer.  There was a similar distribution of malignancies in MP mutation carriers versus non-mutation carriers.  Sequencing is ongoing for 276 additional MP patients to validate these findings.  Conclusions', '  Our results indicate that multiplex panel testing may find a higher rate of mutations in patients with MP malignancies as compared to patients with FBC alone; however, the type of second primary malignancy may not be predictive of mutation status.']",

In order to deepen our knowledge about this and for a purpose referred to therapeutic and prognosis we studied 118 MM tumors and 73 nevi by target next generation sequencing. Methods', ' After extraction, tumor DNA of 118 tumors (44 metastatic tumors, 46 SSM, 11 ALM, 5 nodular, 2 Dubreuilh and 3 spitzoid) and 73 nevi (50 benign nevi, 18 dysplastic nevi and 5 spitzoid nevi) were sequenced using a panel of 15 genes (ALK, BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, GNA11, GNAQ, KIT, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NRAS, RAC1, RAF1, SF3B1, TERT and TP53) on a new generation sequencer (PGM Ion Torrent) using chips 318 with a depth > 51000x . The analysis of the variants was made by dedicated software (Ion Reporter, wAnnovar) and we selected only those which had a sufficient quality score. Results', ' The results of the sequencing showed the presence of very large number of mutations. In the begnin nevi, excepting BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K, present in 86%) there were no other mutations. At the opposite, the percentage of mutations in many other genes (ALK, KIT,CDKN2A,TP53...) in MM tumors range from 55% (Breslow < 1mm) to 90% in metastatic tumors. More than 80% of mutations were transitions C > T reflecting the UV-induced mutagenesis. Interestingly, in 33% of atypical and Spitz nevi, we also found at least one mutation in one of these genes (40% of these mutations were reported in Cosmic databases). Comparison of the proportion of somatic mutations between the different types of nevi, tumors with low thickness and metastatic tumors clearly showed an accumulation of somatic mutations during tumor development. Conclusions', ' This chip dedicated to MM is interesting', ' high sensitivity, allowing a better tumor classification and rapid identification of therapeutic targets. In addition, it could help for MM diagnosis in case of pigmented lesions with atypical component or uncertain diagnosis. In a second step, this panel of markers will be used to detect circulating tumor DNA in plasma of patients and to correlate their presence with melanoma prognosis.']",

Multiplex panel testing may be an efficient way of evaluating MP patients for the presence of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes. However the spectrum of mutations in many cancer susceptibility genes in the MP patient population is largely unknown. We performed massively parallel sequencing using targeted capture of 15 genes with well-established risks of breast and/or other cancers, specifically TP53, CDH1, PTEN, STK11, ATM, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, RAD50, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MUTYH. Our patient cohort consisted of 221 BRCA1/2 negative patients diagnosed with breast cancer and at least one other primary cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients diagnosed with contralateral breast cancer were included. Thirty patients (14%) were found to have at least one deleterious variant in these 15 genes. Deleterious variants were found in CHEK2 (16 patients, 7.2%), TP53 (4, 1.8%), MSH6 (3, 1.4%), ATM (2, 0.9%) and one patient each had deleterious variants in CDKN2A, PTEN, PMS2, PALB2, BRIP1 and NBN. In addition, six patients (2.7%) were found to be heterozygous carriers of a MUTYH mutation. In comparison, deleterious variants were identified in 9% of 341 patients with breast cancer only, indicating a small but nonsignificant increase in the rate of deleterious variants in MP patients. The rate of MUTYH heterozygous mutations was also non-significantly different in patients with breast cancer only (1.2%). There was a significant increase in the rate of CHEK2 and MSH6 mutations in the MP versus breast-only patients (7.2% vs 3.5%, p = 0.04 for CHEK2 and 1.4% vs 0%, p = 0.05 for MSH6). As a corollary study, a subset of MP patients (n = 165) were assayed on a panel including TET2. Deleterious TET2 mutations were identified in 2 of 165 patients (1.2%) at allele frequencies of 0.17 and 0.36. These patients blood samples were ascertained at ages 77 and 72, respectively. These preliminary data show that in our cohort of patients with multiple primary cancers, over 16% of patients were found to have deleterious variants in 15 cancer susceptibility genes. In addition, approximately 1% of MP patients have deleterious variants in TET2 that may be due to age-related clonal hematopoiesis, although it is unknown if these mutations are related to the development of the tumors in these individuals. Further analysis of variants in less well-characterized cancer susceptibility genes and unclassified variants is ongoing. Discovery of clinically relevant mutations can potentially guide future treatment practices for those with similar diagnoses to our patients.']",

Numerous bioinformatics tools to predict the effect of a given amino acid substitution on protein function are available, and there is no consensus as to which prediction algorithms are the most appropriate for the identification of driver mutations. Here we sought to compare the performance, as standalone or in combination, of nine algorithms predictive of the impact of a mutation on protein function, when challenged against mutations whose pathogenic role is supported or refuted by in vitro or in vivo experiments, or have been shown to be pathogenic in the context of familial cancer syndromes.Methods', ' We mined the literature and databases and compiled known mutations for six oncogenes (BRAF, KIT, PIK3CA, KRAS, EGFR, ERRB2) and three tumor suppressors (TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2). We applied Boolean logic to identify experimental and clinical evidence of functional effects for each mutation. A total of 3072 missense mutations were subjected to analysis using nine mutation impact predictor algorithms, namely CHASM lung/breast/melanoma, FATHMM cancer/missense, Mutation Assessor, MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2, Condel, Provean, VEST and SIFT. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated and the agreement between predictors evaluated. Furthermore, predictions made by combinations of algorithms were assessed.Results', \" The PPV of all predictors was relatively high (median 0.941, range 0.909-0.989). Their sensitivity, specificity and NPV, however, varied widely. The median sensitivity was 0.854 (range 0.632-0.987), with the best performers being FATHMM cancer, CHASM lung and melanoma. The median specificity was 0.667 (range 0.482-0.939), with CHASM breast performing best. Inter-predictor agreement was only fair-to-moderate for most pair-wise comparisons (kappa scores ranging from 0.187 to 0.826). Finally, 358/4653 combinations performed better than each of the algorithms tested alone; 163/358 displayed higher NPVs and 131/358 improved sensitivity than the highest single algorithm's NPV and sensitivity, i.e. FATHMM cancer.

Additionally, cfDNA and FFPE samples are typically limited in the amount of material that can be obtained, and often the FFPE samples are highly degraded, compounding the ability to sequence them and to perform accurate variant calling. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a single tube, multiplexed amplicon sequencing technology that employ hundreds of primer pairs for amplification of targeted loci, producing ready-to-run libraries for Illumina sequencing platforms. The resulting amplicons are less than 150 bp in length, enabling amplification and sensitive detection of mutations from cfDNA-sized DNA fragments or highly damaged DNA. A 200+ amplicon panel across 55 genes was developed to target known clinically relevant oncological mutations. The panel design encompasses single exons (e.g. BRAF) as well as comprehensive exon coverage of entire genes (e.g. TP53).DNA was extracted from FFPE, and cfDNA was extracted from fresh plasma. DNA was quantified by qPCR using 2 primer pairs targeting ALU repeat regions. 10ng of DNA input was used to perform the multiplexed PCR. Libraries were quantified by qPCR and sequenced with MiSEQ V2 reagents, paired end reads. Alignment was performed using Burrows-wheeler Aligner (BWA) and variant calling was performed with at least two validated publicly available tools and confirmed manually by IGV. A variety of tools were used to validate allele technology was used to validate the sequencing data.We interrogated 80 FFPE samples using our amplicon technology.The percent of on-target bases was over 95% and the coverage uniformity was over 98%, where uniformity is the percent based covered over 20% of the mean coverage. Out of the 40 colorectal cancer samples tested, 17 showed mutations in KRAS. Out of the 20 melanoma samples (Cure line) also analyzed, 9 were positive for BRAF V600E. The presence of those mutations was confirmed using myTprimerTM KRAS and BRAF qPCR assay. The limit of detection of the assay was set at 3% due to the inherent noise caused by the damage from the FFPE samples. For cell lines with known mutations, the sensitivity was 0.5%. No false positive or false negative were reported. 20 FFPE samples from different cancer types were also assessed. Mutations were identified in ERBB2 (cervical cancer), ALK (lung cancer) and TP53 (colon cancer) genes, as well as MET amplification (lung cancer).Cell free DNA provides a non-invasive tool to monitor cancer progression and treatment efficacy. Tumor DNA, matching blood DNA and cfDNA from 10 cancer patients will be subjected to our multiplex PCR oncology panel.

Seventy-six pts (19%) were diagnosed with 99 additional malignancies, most frequently breast cancer (n=23), prostate cancer (12), melanoma (12), thyroid cancer (6) or a second sarcoma (10). Sarcoma was diagnosed prior to or synchronously (within 6 months) with another malignancy in 20 pts and metachronously in 56 pts. In 18 pts, sarcoma arose within a prior radiation field. Thirty-seven pts (9%) had a sarcoma subtype associated with a recognized syndrome', ' desmoid fibromatosis (n=16), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (11), PEComa/angiomyolipoma (6), retinoblastoma (3), and GIST with paraganglioma (1). Based on additional features, the associated syndromes were confirmed in 6 of them (1.5% of the cohort)', ' familial adenomatous polyposis (n=1), neurofibromatosis type 1 (2), familial retinoblastoma (2), and Carney-Stratakis dyad (1). Thirty-three pts (8% of the cohort, or 16% of pts age <50) fulfilled TP53 testing criteria (Chompret, Birch or classical Li-Fraumeni Syndrome [LFS] criteria). Another 147 pts (37% of the entire cohort) did not fulfill LFS testing criteria, but were diagnosed with sarcoma before age 50 and had at least one first or second degree relative with a diagnosis of malignancy before age 50.  Conclusions', '     Sarcomas are rare and diverse cancers.  Given the potential association with cancer predisposition syndromes, genetic evaluation should be strongly considered in sarcoma pts based on age at diagnosis, histology, and family cancer history.']",

The tests are technically validated and will be completed in clinically relevant timescales.  Data including pathological and treatment information and clinical outcome is also collected for the recruited patients, linked to the genetic data and stored in a central data repository hosted within the National Cancer Registration Service.  The study opened in September 2011 at 7 sites across the UK and by the end of 2011, 760 patientswith breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, ovarian cancer or metastatic malignant melanoma had consented to participate.  142 sets of molecular results had been returned to clinical teams. Updated figures will be presented at the meeting, by which time the programme is projected to have accrued 4000 subjects.  By 2013, we hope to have developed a scalable model for routine, high quality, prospective molecular characterisation of tumours for NHS cancer patients, with consent for the collection, storage and research use of population-scale genetic and clinical outcome data.

The decreasing cost of sequencing has resulted in an increase in the number of cancer genomes that are being sequenced, and thus the numbers of candidate somatic mutations being identified are rapidly expanding. A single cancer genome from a cancer with an average mutation background rate, such as ovarian or breast cancer, will have 3000-6000 mutations. A high mutation rate cancer such as melanoma or colon cancer can have as many as 100,000 mutations/genome. Multiplying these numbers by the dozens of sequenced genomes and hundreds of sequenced exomes across a wide spectrum of tumor types yields a staggering number of candidate mutations. However, approaches for rapidly validating these findings at scale have been lagging behind. Current approaches, such as custom designed hybrid capture arrays followed by sequencing, can take months to complete and cannot begin until the initial sequencing is complete and mutations are called. This can lead to long delays in the interpretation and publication of biological findings. Here we describe the results of several approaches for rapid and efficient validation on large-scale projects, such as TCGA. We will share our approach and results using Fluidigm and PacBio sequencing for validation and sample extension at a small scale with rapid turnaround where we have validated PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in breast cancer samples of varying purity as well as significantly mutated genes in medulloblastoma. Ideally one could validate mutations and gene fusions concurrent with their discovery. To that end, we will also describe our validation results using RNA-Seq data, commonly produced concurrently with genome and exome sequencing, in lung squamous and renal cancer.

        "Background":"['Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is often a rate-limiting event in the treatment of metastatic cancers. Mutations of TP53 or dysfunctions in the p53 pathway are known to play primary roles in the resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents. A stapled alpha-helical p53 peptide (SAH-p53) capable of disrupting the p53-HDM2 and p53-HDMX complexes and restoring p53 function has been found to induce a death response in breast, melanoma and choriocarcinoma cancer cells independent of p53 mutational status. We have recently discovered that the mechanism of death induced by SAH-p53 does not exhibit all of the characteristics of classical apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy independently. The binding of SAH-p53 to HDM2, HDMX, or a yet unidentified target results in a mechanism that leads to the intracellular aggregation of proteins and lipids that are extruded from the cell, resulting in catastrophic damage to the integrity of the cell membrane and culminating in cell death. This type of cell death involves the loss of cytoplasm, generation of phase-clear vacuole-like structures, apparent degradation of cellular membrane components, and the significant release of uniform non-vesicular cellular components. The cellular debris, while yet undefined, displays orange staining with acridine orange as well as accumulation of MitoTracker, suggesting that the debris contains hydrophobic regions. Thus far it has been established that there is a lack of any membrane blebbing, no chromatin condensation, no apoptosis signaling events or typical necrotic bubble formation after treatment with SAH-p53 in cells harboring wild-type p53, mutant p53, or null p53, suggesting an alternative mechanism of cell death. Data suggest the manifestation of early autophagy within 6 hours of SAH-p53 treatment as evidenced by LC3 accumulation, yet this phenotype is lost within 24 hours post-treatment. In addition, the pretreatment of the cells with chloroquine does not inhibit the release of debris and changes in morphology characteristic of SAH-p53 treatment, suggesting that the mechanism of death is independent of classical autophagy. We have begun to uncover the precise mechanism of cell death through the identification and validation of the transcriptional program regulated by SAH-p53 in both wild-type and mutant p53-containing cells via microarray analysis. The complete understanding and characterization of this novel mechanism may be exploited to overcome resistance to apoptosis and thus lead to a more effective way of treating chemotherapy-resistant metastatic cancers.']",

The previously identified four mRNA expression subtypes were again found in the complete set of 412 tumors, and the proportions of samples in each subtype were similar to the previous proportions. Reverse-phase proteomic array analysis of 344 of the samples revealed clusters associated with diagnostic subtype, pathological stage, and grade but not with smoking history or non-muscle invasive status.Conclusions', ' This integrated molecular analysis of 412 TCGA tumor samples largely validates and considerably extends observations from the initial cohort of 131 patients. The larger cohort significantly increased our power to detect lower-frequency aberrations that were not identified in the original cohort. The results provide a robust basis for further functional studies of bladder cancer biology and also provide additional incisive information for the identification of molecular targets for therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Despite improvements in treatment, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal cancers, with a continuous increase in incidence emphasizing the need for further research and therapeutic development. In recent years, we have developed a collection of >40 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from PDAC. In order to determine their relevance for anticancer agent testing, we extensively characterized our models for histology features, whole exome mutations (Hiseq 2000), chromosome rearrangements, gene copy number variations (Affymetrix SNP6) and gene expression (Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0).PDAC from 65 patients were implanted into immuno-compromised mice, resulting in the development of 42 PDX models (success rate 65%). The PDAC from which models were established included moderate and poorly differentiated tumors and were heterogeneous for stroma content. In patient tumors, we showed fibroblast activation but not stroma content predicted poor patient outcome (p<0.0001) and success of PDX establishment (p<0.01). Correlating with those of the parental tumors, the resulting PDAC_PDX also showed heterogeneity for stroma content and for murine fibroblast activation. As seen in patient tumors, the PDAC_PDX were characterized by frequent chromosomal instability, with 38% of the models presenting a moderate hypoploidy while the 62% remaining ones showed a hyperploidy. Two models showed hypermutation due to mismatch repair deficiency while the others had on average a lower mutation load when compared to other histotypes such as colon, lung or melanoma tumors. In total, we identified more than 9000 genes altered by homozygous deletions, high gene amplifications and/or mutations, most of the models showed alterations in KRAS (81%), TP53 (67%), CDKN2A (64%) and TGFBR2/SMAD4 (64%) genes. Next, PDAC_PDX profiles were merged with those of patient tumors to determine PDAC_PDX subtypes and were found to be of the classical (61%), quasi mesenchymal (QM) (34%) and exocrine like subtype (5%) according to the 62 gene expression signature established by Collisson et al. 2011. Preliminary biomarker analysis revealed certain associations between genomic alterations and transcriptome subtypes, such as more frequent alterations in the TGFB pathway in classical PDX (80%) compared to QM (47%). Further detailed biomarkers analyses also addressing questions of molecular determinants of stroma content, of fibroblast activation and of sensitivity toward anticancer agents will be presented.Extensive characterization of our PDAC_PDX collection revealed similarities with patient tumors with regards of histology features including stroma content and fibroblast activation. At molecular level, the models showed similar genomic and transcriptomic patterns as those reported for patient PDAC, altogether, proving the value of this collection for drug development investigations.']",

        "Background":"['We have sequenced the exomes of over 100 and the genomes of over 20 lung adenocarcinoma tumor-normal specimen pairs. We performed hybrid capture exome sequencing of nearly 18,000 genes to >100X median per-sample coverage with 76bp paired-end reads. We performed whole genome sequencing achieving 60X median tumor and 20X median normal coverage with 350bp median insert size and 101bp paired-end reads. Our exome analysis yielded over 50,000 substitution and small indel coding events, with a mean somatic mutation rate of 10-11 events / MB. This resulted in over 300 non-synonymous coding events per patient, most of which were presumed to be passenger mutations unrelated to tumorigenesis. This high mutational load required us to develop novel statistical approaches (MutSig, Lawrence et al, in preparation) to identify putative lung adenocarcinoma driver genes under positive somatic selection. We constructed a complex neutral mutation model that considered sequence context and several additional genomic covariates shown to mediate gene to gene inhomogeneities of passenger mutation rates. Identification of significant deviations from this background model allowed us to recover almost all known frequently mutated lung adenocarcinoma genes, including TP53, KRAS, STK11, PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2, RB1, SMARCA4, and KEAP1, as well as a host of novel putative driver genes. We applied similar principles to identify pathways and sub-networks of genes undergoing apparent positive selection in lung adenocarcinoma. Whole genome analysis yielded several high-confidence in-frame protein fusion and promoter-gene fusion events enriched in tumor vs normal specimens. We also found large numbers of somatic substitution and indel events in promoters, enhancers, and non-coding DNA elements and identified putative sites of somatic retrotransposition in our whole genome data. Overall, our study eclipses previous large-scale characterization of somatic sequence variation (Refs. 1-3) in lung adenocarcinoma by at least an order of magnitude. Using novel methods adapted to the analysis of high-mutation rate tumor types (lung squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer), we are able to recover signals of selection in both known and novel genes and pathways. Our results illuminate novel lung adenocarcinoma tumor biology and provide targets for therapeutic and diagnostic investigation. References 1. Ding et al.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' There is unmet clinical need for automated data processing of deep sequencing in heterogeneous sample populations in molecular oncology specimens. We have developed clinical assays using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for deep sequencing in both solid tumor and hematological indications. We have targeted five genes (ASXL1, RUNX1, EZH2, ETV6, and TP53) involved in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and three genes (BRAF, c-KIT, NRAS) in late stage melanoma. We designed and implemented a data processing pipeline that integrates novel and commercial analysis software to provide automated rules-based filtering and annotation of variants.Methods', ' We used a targeted resequencing approach with the Fluidigm Access Array system for library creation and molecular barcoding for sample multiplexing. Samples were processed in duplicate to filter out potential false positives. Libraries were sequenced using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) systems. Raw data in FastQ format was preprocessed using Windows batch commands and Perl programs that were integrated with NextGENe (SoftGenetics, State College, PA) analysis software for quality trimming, alignment and variant calling against NCBI curated references. Variant calls were compared between duplicate samples and annotated using a separate Perl program that queried databases containing known germline and somatic variants.Results', ' Quality control was implemented by trimming all downstream reads that contained specified Q-scores (Phred, Q16 or above) as well as requiring a minimum coverage depth of 500X per exon. Only variant calls confirmed at greater than 5% in both duplicate samples and with a balanced ratio of forward and reverse reads were considered reportable in a clinical setting. Variants appearing in only one of the duplicates were consistent with systematic errors. Variant calls were annotated with existing database information or were saved in a database of novel mutations by the annotation pipeline. The pipeline removes all systematic errors in known cell line samples by filtering metrics.Conclusions', ' We have developed a robust and automated pipeline for NGS data analysis in the clinical lab that is independent of sequencing platform. The implementation of an automated processing pipeline increases the efficiency and consistency of analysis. Hands-on time for data analysis has been decreased from 30 minutes per sample to less than 5 minutes per sample. Carrying duplicates through the entire multiplexing and sequencing process also helps reduce test based false-positive errors (e.g. PCR errors) while robust analytical metrics remove other sources of error (e.g. strand bias). We have found an average of 6-10 false positive calls in both sample types, all of which were filtered out by the pipeline presented here.']",

        "Background":"[\"Commercial genomic and protein-based profiling was performed on tissue from pancreatic cancer patients who enrolled in the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's Know Your Tumor (KYT) service. The service offers molecular profiling for patients with resectable or metastatic disease, in preparation for their next treatment plan. Patients are eligible to enroll at any institution, clinic, or cancer center in the US. Biopsies, tissue retrieval and testing is coordinated by Perthera, Inc.From 6/2014 to 11/2015 tumor biopsies, resected or archived tissue was obtained from 152 (53% male) pancreatic cancer patients and profiling including NGS/FISH (144 patients) and IHC (143 patients) was performed. The median age at biopsy or resection was 63 (25-83), 55% of the tissue came from liver, 16% from pancreas, 7% lung, 4% peritoneum, and 18% from another type of tissue. 87% of the patients were diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the remaining with another form of confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer.The most identified pathogenic mutations were KRAS (85%), TP53 (72%), CDKN2A (47%), CDKN2B (24%), SMAD4 (22%), ARID1A (10%), STK11 (7%), and BRCA2 (5%). The average number of genomic alterations (likely but not confirmed to be somatic) detected was five per patient from a panel of 320 genes. Molecular modifications that are linked to a treatment option were observed in 44% of patients. Twenty four of 144 patients (17%) had mutations in at least one DNA repair gene potentially benefiting from platinum or PARP inhibitor-based therapies, including BRCA2 (5%), ATM (4%), BAP1 (4%), SMARCA4 (3%), FANC (1%), CHEK2 (1%), and PALB2 (<1%). Other actionable molecular phenotypes observed include anti-HER2 therapies targeting ERBB2 amplifications (3%) and mTOR inhibitors suitable for patients with mutations in STK11/LKB1 (7%), PTEN (3.5%), PIK3R1 (<1%), or PIK3CA (3%). Actionable alterations identified with a low frequency (<2%) include RET fusions, amplifications of FGFR, CRKL, AXL, and mutations in NTRK3, MEN1 (PNET), and BRAF. One patient harbored the BRAF V600E mutation, prompting consideration of off label melanoma-approved therapy. Overexpression of ALK by IHC was observed in one patient who chose to enroll in a ceritinib clinical trial. Six percent of patients were PDL-1 positive, and 22% were positive for PD-1 from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting possible activity from immune checkpoint inhibitors.To date, 7 of the 152 patients have enrolled in a clinical trial, 4 were treated with an off label treatment, 67 have yet to make their next treatment decision, and 53 are known to be deceased. KYT has successfully profiled tumors and presented targeted treatment options to patients and physicians in 33 states regardless of a patient's socioeconomic background and geographic location, moving the field a step closer towards a democratized, personalized approach to treating pancreatic cancer.\"]",

Here we report the analytical validation of the Ion AmpliSeq v2 Cancer Panel (ACP) in plasma ctDNA samples.Methods', 'Mutations were assessed using the ACP, designed to survey 2800 mutations in 50 cancer-related genes. TruQ reference standards were used to determine LOD. Healthy donor and cancer patient plasma samples were used for other studies. Eight libraries were barcoded and sequenced with PGM sequencing 200 kit v2 on a 318 v2 chip. The sequencing data were analyzed with a combination of Torrent Suite 3.4.2, VarScan, our proprietary analysis pipeline and IGV. The background noise level of hotspot nt positions was calculated from multiple runs of known wild type DNA. In order to increase the sensitivity of the assay to detect low-level mutation, a custom program was developed to detect variants clearly different from background noise (95% confidence) and not reported by the two variant callers. PCR methods were used for concordance testing.Results', 'The performance characteristics of the AmpliSeq v2 Cancer Panel were demonstrated in 1) Minimum DNA input and LOD', ' With 10 ng DNA input, 43/43 and 42/43 expected mutations were detected at 2.5% or 1%, respectively. With 1 ng DNA input, 42/43 and 40/43 expected mutations were detected at 2.5% and 1%, respectively. 2) Coverage', ' The mean library coverage for 40 plasma libraries was 2912x with only 5 non-critical regions below 250x coverage. 3) Baseline error rate', ' 95% of 2290 hot-spots for SBS showed <0.5% background error frequency assessed in 10 healthy control ctDNA samples. The mean background error frequency plus two folds of SD falls below 0.5% for 91% of SBS hot-spots. 4)Precision', ' All mutations expected for TruQ6 were detected in 4 independent runs at observed allele frequencies with 0.6% mean SD and 0.1% mean deviation from the true value. A 2% TP53 mutation R174W was reproducibly detected in a lung cancer plasma sample in 2 independent runs. 5) Concordance study', ' Consistent results were observed for 3 positive (Allele Freq 40%, 3% and 0.2%, respectively) and 3 negative melanoma plasma samples previously genotyped by AS-PCR for Braf V600E/K mutations. Additional cancer patient ctDNA samples are being assessed for concordance in the detection of other mutations.Conclusions', 'The ACP offers a useful tool for comprehensive somatic mutation profiling in ctDNA. The limit of detection is 1-2% mutation frequency for most mutations with slight variation across different nucleotide positions. The low concentration of ctDNA obtained from plasma samples can present a challenge. Less than 10 ng DNA input may result in allele drop out for low level mutations due to the inefficient amplification of multiplex PCR compared with PCR methods using a short length single amplicon. Higher DNA input to rescue allele drop-out is under evaluation.']",
