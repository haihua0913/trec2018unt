        "Background":"['Background', '  V600E and V600K mutations are the most common BRAF mutations in melanoma. We previously showed that non-V600 BRAF mutations account for 12% of all BRAF mutations in melanoma. Limited clinical data are available for non-V600 BRAF mutant melanomas. To better understand non-V600 BRAF mutations in melanoma, characteristics of tumor and clinical outcomes were investigated.  Methods', \"  Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively in patients (pts) with melanoma who had multi-gene mutation analysis (next-gene sequencing) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Fisher's exact test was used for all comparisons.  Results\", '  We found 52 pts with non-V600 BRAF mutations, among whom 8 had NRAS/non-V600 co-mutations. Common non-V600 mutations were K601E (17.3%), G469E (15.4%), G469R (7.7%), D594G (5.8%), L597S (5.8%), and S467L (5.8%). Compared with V600E mutations as a control (n=82) , the presence of a non-V600 mutations was significantly associated with older age (median, 58 years vs 50; P=0.001), less superficial spreading type (13.6% vs 32.9%; P=0.02), more lentigo maligna type (20% vs 1.2%; P=0.001), more mucosal subtype (9.1% vs 1.2%; P=0.03), more head/neck primary tumor location (36.4% vs 15.9%; P=0.03), less lower extremity primary tumor location (4.5% vs 24.4%; P=0.003), more co-mutations with NRAS (15.4% vs 2.4%, p=0.005) and stage IV disease at initial diagnosis (31.8% vs 7.3%; P=0.0003).  Among the 33 pts with non-V600 mutant metastatic melanoma, 7 received selective BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi). Of the 5 evaluable patients (2 could not tolerate treatment), all had disease progression within 2 months.  Conclusions', '  Non-V600 BRAF mutant melanomas have more aggressive clinical characteristics, more likely to have co-mutations with NRAS, and not responsive to selective BRAFi than V600E mutations.  A larger cohort and a longer follow-up will better define the prognostic indication of non-V600 mutated melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in 40-60% of melanomas with the majority of mutations resulting in V600E/K. Previous cohort studies have identified rates of non-V600E/K BRAF mutations to occur in 5-12% of patients. Despite this, there remains limited evidence characterizing the disease characteristics and outcomes of patients who harbor the non-classical BRAF mutation. Methods', ' Retrospective review of all melanoma patients treated at a tertiary cancer center that had BRAF mutation testing through targeted sequencing. Three groups of patients were identified and compared with respect to patient and disease characteristics', ' a) BRAF negative; b) BRAF V600E/K positive; c) BRAF non-V600E/K positive. Results', ' BRAF testing was performed in 168 melanoma patients of which 101 (60%) were BRAF negative; 55 (33%) were BRAF V600E/K positive; 12 (7%) were BRAF non-V600E/K positive (2 G466E, 1 of each G469E, K601N, K601E, L597Q, L597S, V741I, N594G, D594N, V600R and 1 with both K601N & V600E). Of these, 147 patients had baseline demographic and treatment data available for analysis. BRAF mutations were more common among males (45.6% of men vs. 22.7% of women, p = 0.03). No significant differences between other baseline patient demographics noted. Pathological characteristics revealed a non-significant trend toward poorer prognostic factors with BRAF non-V600E/K patients having increased Breslow depth (7.0 mm vs. 5.0 mm BRAF negative, 4.3 mm BRAF V600E/K) and higher rates of ulceration (71% vs. 44% BRAF negative, 30% BRAF V600E/K). BRAF non-V600E/K patients displayed a non-significant trend toward poorer overall survival (71 months vs. 215 months BRAF negative, 125 months BRAF V600E/K). Conclusions', ' Non-V600E/K BRAF positive patients appear to display less favorable disease characteristics and outcomes as compared to BRAF negative and BRAF V600E/K positive patients. Non-V600E/K melanoma show limited response to BRAF targeted therapy; however, evidence suggests the presence of non-classical mutations may confer susceptibility to MEK inhibition. Further characterization of non-V600E/K BRAF melanoma may allow for more refined prognostication and treatment decisions.']",
