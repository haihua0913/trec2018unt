Preclinical and Phase 1 clinical data show the drug has minimal activity in tumors lacking BRAF mutations, creating a need for an accurate diagnostic test to identify appropriate patients for therapy. Methods', ' To assess eligibility for BRIM-2, a Phase 2 trial of V in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma,  tumor samples were screened with an investigational PCR assay (cobas 4800 BRAF  V600 Mutation Test) designed to detect the canonical V600E (1799T>A) mutation. 328 samples were tested of which 327 samples gave valid results. BRAF mutations were detected in 184 (56.3 %); 132 patients with BRAF-mutation positive melanoma were enrolled into the trial based on clinical eligibility criteria. Sanger sequencing was performed retrospectively on DNA samples from all  enrolled patients. Results', ' Fifteen samples (11.4%) gave invalid Sanger results. Sanger detected a V600E mutation in 97 samples (73.5%), V600K mutation in 9 samples (6.8%)  and a wild-type (WT) result in 11 cases (8.3%). Samples were also subjected to deep sequencing with a quantitative picotiter plate pyrosequencing method (454 GS-Titanium) to resolve differences between PCR and Sanger results. Using 454 sequencing of  samples with invalid Sanger results revealed a V600E mutation in 14 cases and a V600K mutation in 1 case. Of 11 samples with a WT Sanger result, 454 sequencing detected a V600E mutation in all cases, with a median percentage of mutant alleles of 8%;  ten of the 11 samples had a percentage < 25%. The presence of a V600K mutation was confirmed by 454 sequencing in all 9 samples identified as having V600K mutations by Sanger. Conclusions', ' 1) the investigational PCR test had a low failure rate; 2) the PCR test was more sensitive in the detection of V600E mutations than Sanger sequencing, which may miss mutations in cases with low % mutant alleles; 3) the PCR test detects V600K mutations, and 4) in all 132 cases, a codon 600 mutation was confirmed by Sanger and/or 454 sequencing. Robust, rapid and accurate molecular testing was achieved in this multi-center clinical trial.']",

However, the inter and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity for BRAF status has been described supporting the need for testing multiple sites for the same patient. Circulating DNA is considered a promising non-invasive tool for cancer monitoring. The objective of our work was to determine the potential of plasma DNA to detect BRAF mutations, particularly in patients presenting discordant BRAF status from different tumor sites.  Methods', '  Plasma DNA was extracted using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification system (Invitrogen). BRAF mutations were detected using the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen).  Results', '  Ninety-nine patients were included, and plasma was collected at baseline. Nine stage III melanoma patients presenting a mutant BRAF (6 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600D) were tested and for 4 of them we detected the corresponding mutation (including the V600D and both V600K) in circulating DNA (sensitivity 44.4 %). Similarly, 20 stage IV patients were tested (17 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600R). The corresponding mutation (including the V600R and both V600K) was detected in 15 of these patients (sensitivity 75.0%). Interestingly, 4 stage IV patients included in our series presented discordant BRAF mutation status on different sites (1 patient with a WT primary tumor (PT) and a V600E lymph node (LN) metastasis; 1 patient with a V600E PT and WT LN metastasis; 2 patients with a V600E PT, V600E LN and WT liver metastasis). We were able to detect the expected BRAF mutation in circulating DNA for all these patients.  Conclusions', '  The sensitivity of our procedure, based on approved kits, suggests a high interest for use in clinical practice, even for non-V600E mutations. Plasma DNA might be less sensitive to heterogeneity between tumor samples, and therefore might represent an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations in clinical setting.']",

BRAF mutations have been identified approximately 50% of melanoma. V600 mutations increase BRAF kinase activity promoting melanoma growth. Approximately 90% of all identified BRAF mutations are V600E and 5%-12% are V600K amino acid substitutions. Targeted agents that inhibit BRAF kinase activity have improved progression-free survival when used in BRAF mutant melanoma. RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways are key players in melanoma progression and drug resistance. CLART CMA BRAF-MEK1-AKT1 is a novel diagnostic assay to evaluate the BRAF V600E/K mutation in order to screen patients for treatment with inhibitor of BRAF kinase activity. Moreover this is able to identify mutations in MEK1 and AKT1 genes that could be related with resistance to inhibitors of BRAF kinase activity. Methods', ' Specific ARMS-primers and hybridization probes for detecting mutations BRAF V600E and V600K, MEK1 I111S, P124S and E203K, and AKT1 Q79K were designed. Clinical testing was performed using 155 samples which contained the targets of this assay and samples with wild type alleles. The results were cross checked by comparison to Sanger sequencing methodology. Results', ' Analytical sensitivity was assessed using recombinant plasmids, results ranged in 1000 copies/l for the most prevalent BRAF V600E mutation. For the rest of mutations in BRAF, MEK1 and AKT1 results ranged in 10000 copies/l.

In these rare BRAF mutants, the effects of vemurafenib (Vem) and other MAPK pathway inhibitors on signaling, growth rate and clinical course are not well understood. In cell lines with rare BRAF mutations, we investigated the effect of Vem, inhibitors of Pan-RAF (Amgen 2112819), MEK (trametinib), ERK (MERK SCH772984), Pan-RAFi+ MEKi and ERKi+Vem on growth and signaling. These results were compared to the clinical responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients with the original tumors. Regardless of the mutation, no paradoxical activation of MAPK pathway by Vem was observed and the Pan-Rafi decreased levels of pMEK in all the cell lines. A heterozygous V600K mutated cell line was sensitive to Vem and more sensitive to the other drugs. Clinically, the duration of response to Vem in the patient the cell line was derived from was 7 months, and an additional 3 months to the combination of Vem and MEKi upon progression on Vem. In contrast, a homozygous V600K mutated cell line was resistant to Vem but sensitive to other MAPK inhibitors. The patient the cell line was derived from had a 5 month response to Vem followed by a 2 month response to the addition of a MEKi. BRAF L597S cell line was only sensitive to ERKi and G466K and V600R mutated cell lines were resistant to all the drugs. In general, Vem was the least effective followed by Pan-RAFi with ERKi stronger than both in most cell lines. The combination of Vem and ERKi showed similar or slightly higher growth inhibition than ERKi alone. In conclusion, MAPK inhibitors are not as effective in melanoma cell lines with rare BRAF mutations. However, more growth inhibition can be achieved by MEKi-Pan-RAFi combination.

Previous observations have additionally suggested that specific copy number profiles may be associated with BRAF, NRAS and WT/WT status. The randomized, phase III clinical trial E2603', ' carboplatin, paclitaxel, +/- sorafenib (CP vs. CPS) offers the largest available collection of tumor samples from patients with well annotated clinical outcome to evaluate these associations. We evaluated copy number variants (CNVs) using array Comparative Genomic Hybridization in melanoma tumor samples from patients treated on this trial. Genomic DNA was hybridized on SurePrint G4 human CGH microarrays 2 x 440 K (Agilent). Copy number gains and losses were  0.3 or  -0.3 on a log2 scale, respectively (Nexus BioDiscovery, Inc). In 119 melanoma tumor samples, 45% had BRAF mutations, 24% NRAS mutations, and 24% without either (designated WT), CNVs were evaluated in an initial set of 26 genes known to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Overall genomic instability, as measured by number of genes with CNVs, was associated with poor ECOG performance status (P=0.007) and marginally significant for more organs with metastatic involvement (P=0.06), and is consistent with other studies suggesting that genomic instability is a predictor of worsened outcome. We further explored the association between copy number and somatic mutation status. Not surprisingly, BRAF gene amplification was observed in 91% of BRAF mutant melanoma tumor samples (P<0.001, as compared to 66% of NRAS/WT samples). The average value of BRAF copy number was higher in tumor samples with BRAF V600K mutations compared to samples with BRAF V600E mutations (1.11 v 0.55, P<0.001). MET, also on chr 7, was found to be amplified in 59% of BRAF mutated melanoma tumor samples. The average value of MET copy number was also higher in BRAF V600K mutant compared to BRAF V600E mutant melanoma (0.53 v 0.27, P=0.04), which may contribute to the differing clinical behaviors of melanomas with the two mutations. Patients with BRAF copy number gain had a trend towards lower overall response rate to either treatment compared to diploid (15.2% v 29.6%, OR=0.37, P=0.08). Patients with NRAS copy number gain receiving CPS had significantly improved overall survival compared to patients receiving CP alone (HR=0.35, P=0.03) in multivariable Cox model. We had previously found a trend suggesting an improved clinical response and PFS in patients with NRAS mutant melanoma treated with CPS as compared to CP. Our present study demonstrates an association between CNVs and treatment response to CP or CPS, as well as an association with somatic mutations. In addition, distinct cooperating genomic events identified in somatic mutation cohorts, such as MET and BRAF V600K gain, may contribute to the pathogenesis of melanoma tumors.']",

        "Background":"['IntroductionActivating mutations in the BRAF gene are common in skin and colorectal tumors. In more than 90% of the cases, these mutations are located in the BRAF V600 codon (V600E and V600K). Targeted therapies like vemurafenib and dabrafenib have shown objective response rates in up to half of metastatic melanomas harboring these BRAF V600 mutations. Tumor mutation status is usually assessed starting from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue shavings. Typically, the test involves shipment of the paraffin block from the local pathology lab to a specialized molecular lab, where several steps need to be performed.MethodsThe Biocartis molecular diagnostics (MDx) prototype platform is a novel, random access, sample-in result-out automated qPCR system. It uses a disposable cartridge which can simultaneously detect and quantify up to 30 molecular markers from a wide range of solid and liquid sample types, including blood, feces, and sputum. For FFPE-based assays, a single curl or shaving is directly placed into the cartridge. The complete process time for sample preparation, PCR and reporting is less than 90 min, with <2 minutes hands-on time. We hereby present a concordance study of the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay (which detects BRAF V600E, V600K, V600R, V600E2, V600D and V600M) with the Roche cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test (Cobas). Sixty-four FFPE samples from melanoma and other tumors, with varying amounts of melanin, % tumor, and % BRAF V600 mutated tumor cells were randomly selected and tested. Both the Biocartis MDx prototype platform and the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay were used for research use only purposes. Deep sequencing was performed using MiSeq (Illumina) with over 5,000-fold coverage and sensitivity of 1% of minority species for each sample.ResultsOne sample was not eligible for Cobas testing because of low tumor content. Three other samples failed on both platforms. For the remaining 60 samples, results on the Biocartis MDx platform and Cobas were concordant in 58 (96.7%) samples (44 BRAF V600 WT and 14 BRAF V600 mutant samples, of which 36 samples were randomly selected and confirmed by deep sequencing). In 2 (3.3%) samples, no BRAF V600 mutation was detected by Cobas, while a BRAF V600 mutation was detected by both the Biocartis MDx platform and by deep sequencing. Both were melanoma samples (one of which was highly pigmented), excised in 1993 and 2005, and contained 4.6% V600E and 5.6% V600K (as determined by deep sequencing), respectively.ConclusionsThe new MDx platform is a fast and reliable method for BRAF V600 mutation testing directly on FFPE tumor shavings with superior analytical sensitivity, ease of use, and turnaround time compared to existing diagnostic tests. The BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay provided excellent concordance with both Cobas (96.7%) and deep sequencing (100%).']",

The main objective of our work was to compare the performance of several assays to detect mutant BRAF in plasma. Methods', ' A total of 54 patients with stage IIIc-IV melanoma (38 BRAF V600 mutated and 16 BRAF wild type) were tested prior to any treatment. Blood samples were collected in EDTA-containing tubes. Cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma using the QIAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid (Qiagen). We evaluated 3 technologies ', ' 2 assays based on allele-specific PCR, the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen) and the ctBRAF Mutation Detection Kit (Entrogen), and a digital PCR platform, the QuantStudio 3D system (Life Technologies). Results', ' Using the Therascreen assay, we were able to detect a BRAF mutation in plasma of 28/38 patients, yielding a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 73.7% when compared with tumor as the reference sample. Similar results were obtained using the Entrogen assay, with a PPA of 68.4% (26/38). The 2 most common activating mutations, V600E and V600K, had a similar PPA with both Qiagen and Entrogen tests. For all patients with wild type BRAF tumors, the research was negative on plasma DNA with both techniques (negative percent agreement, NPA = 100%). The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA = 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions', ' The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills. The unexpectedly low PPA of dPCR was attributed to the limited amount of DNA extracted from some samples. These findings suggest that the Qiagen and Entrogen plasma tests are more adapted as a screening tool for non-invasive assessment of BRAF mutation in metastatic melanoma but could be complemented with dPCR as an absolute quantification tool for follow-up.

Responses to dasatinib in DDR2-mutated lung tumors are currently being investigated in clinical trials. We investigated whether somatic DDR2 mutations also occur in melanomas using a set of different clinical subtypes bearing a variety of melanoma-associated molecular alterations.  Methods', '  DNA was extracted from macrodissected FFPE sections of 168 melanomas and subjected to next-generation sequencing using a custom-designed 36-amplicon panel including the coding regions of DDR2 and exons 11 and 15 of BRAF. PCR products were prepared by Access Array, sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM, and analyzed using Sequence Pilot software.  All DDR2 mutations were confirmed by bidirectional Sanger sequencing. Relative expression analysis of the DDR2 gene was performed using RT-PCR on RNA extracted from FFPE sections, with levels normalized to ABL1 and GAPDH.  Results', '  Heterozygous DDR2 point mutations were identified in 3.4% of BRAF-mutated melanoma (n=117) but not in any cases that lacked BRAF mutations (n = 51).

In contrast to the range of mutation sites reported in lung cancers, DDR2 mutations in melanoma (I488S, F574C, S667F and L701F) were at highly evolutionarily conserved positions in the kinase domain. The mutations are expected to be disruptive and may therefore modulate kinase activity.  DDR2 transcripts were expressed in tumor cells in all mutated cases.

This oncogenic mutation in the BRAF gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway and results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. BRAF V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). However, it is challenging to identify patients with this mutation. Currently, the gold standard is sequencing of the tumor DNA, but this method is not practical for routine practice. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a relatively easy diagnostic tool to detect proteins in paraffin-embedded tissues. The major goal of this study was to compare detection of BRAF V600E by sequencing and IHC using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody.

Methods. BRAF/NRAS genotype, ERK activation, IFNAR1 and HLA class I antigen expression were tested in 60 primary melanoma tumors of treatment nave patients. The effect of BRAF-I on IFNAR1 expression was assessed in 3 melanoma cell lines and in 4 tumor biopsies of BRAFV600E metastatic melanomas. The anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and immunomodulatory activity of BRAF-I and IFN combination was tested both in vitro and in vivo utilizing 3 melanoma cell lines, HLA class I antigen-MA derived peptide complex-specific T cells and immunodeficient mice (5 mice /group for mice survival and 10 mice/group for inhibition of tumor growth). All statistical tests were two-sided. Differences were considered statistically significant when the P value was <0.05. Results. IFNAR1 level was statistically significantly (P<0.001) lower in BRAFV600E primary melanoma tumors than in BRAF wild type tumors. IFNAR1 down-regulation was reversed by BRAF-I treatment in the 3 melanoma cell lines (P0.02) and in 3 out of 4 tumor biopsies from metastatic melanoma patients.

BRAF is part of the MAPK signaling pathway and the V600E mutation of BRAF confers full activation of this survival pathway. Several clinical trials are being conducted using mutated BRAF as a target but so far, all this trials works during a certain moment but soon, melanoma cells becomes resistant to treatment by activating some survival pathways that can continues the signal initialized in the MAPK pathway. Our objective is to evaluate if the combination of BRAF inhibitors and CDKs inhibitors can suppress the acquired resistance of V600E melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitors. Two melanoma cell lines were used in this study. The SKMel 28 cell line, which has BRAF V600E mutation, and the SKMel 02, which is wild type to BRAF. Olomoucine and Roscovitine were the CDKs inhibitors used in this study, while PLX-4720 was BRAF inhibitor. Western blot and Real time PCR were used to verify some survival pathways, like the MAP3K8 and the PRKD3 pathway, that are overexpressed after BRAF inhibition and MTT assay was used to verify cell viability with both treatments combined. The combination of Olomoucine and PLX-4720 or Roscovitine and PLX-4720 could sensitize the BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell line SKMel 28, but not the BRAF wild type melanoma cell line SKMel 02. Two survival pathways (MAP3K8 and PRKD3) which are activated after BRAF inhibition by PLX-4720 were downregulated in the presence of the CDKs inhibitors in the SKMel 28 melanoma cell line. Also, the retinoblastoma protein was not phosphorylated when the SKMel28 melanoma cell line was treated with the BRAF inhibitor together with the CDKs. The treatment with the BRAF inhibitor and the CDKs inhibitors can sensitize BRAF V600E melanoma cells by decreasing cell viability, downregulation of survival pathways induced by the BRAF inhibitor and preventing Rb phosphorylation. This strategy may overcome the acquired resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma after treatment with its inhibitors.']",

Manipulation of key epigenetic regulators, including inhibition of Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family members impairs cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in different cancers, including melanoma. BET inhibition is thought to impair downstream transcriptional activity of the MAPK (MAPK) pathway and other key oncogenic signaling pathways, suggesting complementarity with MAPK inhibition. Here, we investigated the effect of combining the BET inhibitor JQ1 with the BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib in in vitro and in vivo models of BRAF-mutant melanoma. We additionally screened potential synergism of JQ-1 with 27 additional compounds including inhibitors of the proteasome, histone deacetylases (HDACi) and MEK.Methods', ' We performed cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays, and a xenograft mouse model to determine the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of JQ1 in combination with Vemurafenib against BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. Further, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of this combined treatment, we conducted antibody arrays of in vitro drug-treated cell lines and RNA sequencing of drug-treated xenograft tumors. Synergism between JQ1 and other targeted compounds was examined by in vitro cytotoxicity assays.Results', ' The combination of JQ1 and Vemurafenib acted synergistically in BRAF-mutant cell lines. Additional combinations that were found synergistic included JQ-1 plus proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and marizomib, HDAC inhibitors (romidepsin and panobinostat), or anti-Bcl2 small molecules (Obatoclax and TW-37). The combination of JQ-1 and Vemurafenib resulted in marked apoptosis in vitro, with up-regulation of several pro-apoptotic proteins involved in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. In vivo, this combination treatment suppressed tumor growth and significantly improved survival compared to either drug alone. RNA sequencing of tumor tissues revealed almost four thousand genes that were uniquely modulated by the combination. Furthermore, several anti-apoptotic genes such as MCL-1, BCL-XL and BCL-2 were significantly down-regulated.Conclusions', ' Collectively, our data provide a rationale for combinations of BET inhibitors with additional compounds including BRAF inhibitors, as a novel strategy for the treatment of melanoma.']",

Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples. In future experiments we plan to test clinical samples from patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and we hypothesize that HGF, NRG1, and FGF2 signaling is elevated in patients with poor initial responses or relapse to BRAF or MEK inhibitors.']",

While durable resistance is mediated frequently by stable alterations intrinsic to the tumor cells leading to ERK1/2 pathway reactivation, the compensatory activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) modulates the level of initial response. The composition of the tumor microenvironment likely plays a key role in these compensatory/adaptive responses to targeted inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrate that NRG1 is expressed in fibroblasts, as well as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from a mutant BRAF melanoma. Fibroblast derived-NRG1 was able to mediate the enhanced ErbB3 pathway activation in RAF-inhibited mutant BRAF melanoma cells. Furthermore, conditioned medium from fibroblasts and CAFs limits RAF inhibitor cytotoxicity in V600 BRAF-harboring melanomas. Importantly, ErbB3 and ErbB2 targeting antibodies partially reverse the protective effects of fibroblast-derived medium on ErbB3 pathway activation and cell growth properties of mutant BRAF-inhibited melanoma cells. Together, these data demonstrate a requirement for a paracrine-produced factor in the tumor microenvironment to promote resistance to RAF inhibitor in mutant BRAF melanoma and reinforce the idea that targeting ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling may improve the efficacy of RAF inhibitors.']",

The areas of the NMR resonances were analysed using a multivariate method (Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis, PLS-DA) as well as targeted analysis in which metabolite levels were normalized to cell number and an internal standard.Target inhibition was confirmed by western blotting for P-MEK1/2 and P-ERK1/2 protein levels while treatment-induced changes in metabolic enzyme expression were assessed by qRT-PCR and western-blotting.Results', ' As expected, exposure to vemurafenib led to a fall in P-MEK1/2 and P-ERK1/2 levels, consistent with BRAF inhibition. PLS-DA analyses revealed a good separation of control and treated 1H NMR spectra (correlation coefficient, R2 = 100%, predicted variation, Q2 = 96.5%) mainly based on differences in lactate, myo-inositol, glycine and acetate. This correlated well with the values obtained after targeted analysis of the 1H NMR spectra, which showed a significant reduction in intracellular lactate (to 629%) and acetate (to 629%), and an increase in glycine (to18962%,) and myo-inositol (to 25125%) in vemurafenib-treated cells relative to controls (p0.03).

We show that the drugs were active against patient derived xenografts (PDXs) from patients with acquired or intrinsic resistance to BRAF-selective inhibitors and in whose tumors resistance was associated with ERK pathway reactivation. Further, our compounds are active in a PDX from a patient whose tumor developed acquired resistance to a combination of a BRAF-selective plus a MEK inhibitor and associated with acquisition of an NRAS mutation. Thus, our panRAF inhibitors can inhibit melanomas with different mechanisms of acquired or intrinsic resistance to BRAF-selective and BRAF-selective/MEK inhibitor combinations, potentially providing first-line treatment for nave patients and second-line treatments for a range of relapsed patients.']",

        "Background":"[\"Targeted inhibition of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway has received much attention after the transient success of the BRaf inhibitor, vemurafenib, in metastatic melanoma patients with the BRafV600E mutation. Approximately 50% of melanomas have an activating mutation to BRaf which drives cancer cell proliferation and survival through the ERK pathway. Therapies targeting BRaf or its downstream kinase MEK1/2 have demonstrated very promising initial clinical results. However, these treatments invariably lead to drug resistance through the activation of alternate pathways or mutations that circumvent the blockade and reactivate ERK1/2. Current efforts are centered on the use of combination therapies as well as the direct inhibition of ERK1/2 itself. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of putative substrate-selective ERK inhibitors in various clinically relevant models of drug resistance. Specifically melanoma cell lines resistant to BRaf and MEK inhibitors, PLX-4032 and AZD-6244 respectively, were generated to test the efficacy of these novel compounds in cell viability assays. Furthermore, the potency of these molecules was evaluated in the context of activating mutations to MEK1 and drug resistant cell lines that overexpress MAP3K8 (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2). The data shows that these putative substrate-selective ERK inhibitors preferentially inhibit proliferation of cell lines with activated ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, these novel molecularly targeted therapies are equipotent in drug resistant versus non-resistant melanoma cells. Given these compounds' selectivity for BRaf mutated melanoma cells and their efficacy in drug resistance models, we submit these novel chemical entities as potential lead candidates for new salvage therapies in patients who have become resistant to currently available treatments. Moreover, these ATP-independent inhibitors target only select ERK1/2 functions and may be inherently less susceptible to developing their own drug resistance as compared to complete ablation of all ERK1/2 signaling as seen with ATP-competitive inhibitors.\"]",

Recent reports suggest that growth factors and their receptors may play a role in mediating this resistance. HGF/MET signaling has been shown to play a role in mediating resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma. We studied the role of HGF/MET in mediating resistance to BRAF inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma xenografts, comparing models of systemic and local HGF expression and evaluating the ability of a MET inhibitor to reverse HGF mediated resistance. The underlying mechanisms of this resistance were evaluated by monitoring changes in PI3K and MAPK signaling. Our data suggest that elevated local HGF expression may be required for resistance to BRAF inhibition in vivo and that resistance can be reversed by treatment with a MET inhibitor.Methods', ' To model systemic HGF expression, mice bearing G361 melanoma xenografts were treated with recombinant adeno-associated virus containing an expression cassette for human HGF (AAV-HGF) or GFP as control. Mice were treated with C-1 (10 mg/kg, QD, PO), a BRAF inhibitor, or vehicle, and tumor growth was monitored. Local HGF expression was modeled using G361 xenografts engineered to express HGF under the control of an inducible promoter (tet-HGF). Mice bearing G361 tet-HGF xenografts, with or without doxycycline, were treated and monitored as described above. A follow up study was performed in G361 tet-HGF xenografts to measure the ability of AMG 337 (20 mg/kg, BID, PO), a selective MET inhibitor, to attenuate the HGF mediated rescue of BRAF inhibition. To monitor effects on the PI3K and MAPK pathways, pAKT and pERK levels were measured in tumors. Plasma and tumor HGF levels were also measured.Results', ' Systemic expression of HGF via AAV-HGF treatment failed to rescue G361 xenografts from the growth inhibitory effects of C1. In contrast, local doxycycline-induced expression of HGF in mice harboring G361 tet-HGF xenografts conveyed significant (p<0.001) rescue of tumor growth, suggesting that local HGF expression may be required to mediate BRAF inhibitor resistance. Elevated pAKT and pERK levels were detected in HGF rescued tumors, suggesting that PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways play a role in conveying HGF mediated resistance. Combined treatment with AMG 337 prevented the HGF mediated rescue of BRAF inhibition, confirming the role of MET signaling in this rescue mechanism. Plasma HGF levels in mice from the systemic HGF expression groups exceeded those in the local groups (3,049 and 195 pg/mL). However, tumor HGF levels were higher in the local expression groups compared to the systemic groups (26,400 and 477 pg/mL).Conclusion', ' Here we demonstrate the role for HGF/MET signaling in mediating resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma and suggest that monitoring HGF levels may be of clinical utility for predicting response to BRAF inhibition and in defining the opportunity for combination therapy with MET inhibitors.']",

LTR was defined as clinical or radiological benefit longer than 14 months (mos). Biological data about circulating lymphocyte subpopulations and CCL2 levels were also determined. Results', ' 46 pts (26 men, 20 women) were identified. Median age was 58 years. ECOG performance status was 0 in 44 pts. Disease stage was M1a in 14 pts, M1c in 20 pts. 8 pts had high serum LDH levels and 5 brain metastases at baseline. 41 pts harbored BRAF V600E mutation, 5 V600K. Median follow up was 47 mos. 5 pts had received adjuvant interferon; 9 pts had been treated with up to 3 lines for metastatic disease (either chemotx or ipilimumab). According to RECIST 1.1, 22% of pts showed complete response (CR), 50% partial response and 22% stable disease. Notably, all CRs were maintained for more than 2 years. 26 pts progressed, mostly (38%) with brain metastases; 16 of them continued tx beyond progression. Median duration of response was 33 mos, being significantly longer in M1a than in M1c (44 versus 28 mos). Median PFS was 32.5 mos; median OS was not reached. All pts experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE); the AEs were moderate or severe in 22% of cases. 19 pts underwent dose reduction, but no discontinuation due to AEs was observed.

In this study we evaluated the potential of a probe-based, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to quantitatively measure copies of DNA encoding the mutant BRAFV600E and wild-type alleles in the plasma of patients undergoing treatment with a BRAF inhibitor. We previously showed this assay to be 100% specific with a sensitivity to detect 1 mutant copy among 10,000 wild-type copies when sufficient input DNA was used.Methods', ' Ten patients with BRAF-mutant stage IV melanoma were prospectively studied. At least 3 serially-collected plasma samples were available for each patient, corresponding to pre-treatment, best treatment response, and progression of disease as evidenced by PET/CT scan. DNA was extracted from plasma samples and concentrations were measured using a Qubit fluorometer. The relevant BRAF region was assayed using 24 to a maximum of 337 ng of DNA from each sample, using multiple replicate wells for dilute samples to maximize the probability of detecting BRAF mutant copies. Specific Taqman 5 hydrolysis probes for wild-type and mutant BRAF were employed along with common primers to measure the number of copies of each amplicon/reaction. The amount of amplifiable DNA was measured using RPP30 as a control gene.Results', ' All 10 patients had partial responses. We analyzed 35 plasma samples, of which 30 had a minimum of 4ml of plasma. Qubit-based DNA concentrations ranged from 6.9 to 1158 ng/ml. All samples yielded positive amplification of the BRAF and RPP30 amplicons. Total BRAF DNA concentrations ranged from 719 to 156,920 copies/ml plasma. Mutant BRAF DNA concentrations ranged from 0 to 13,028 copies/ml. The fraction of BRAFV600E amplicons ranged from 0 to 45%, with a minimal detected mutant fraction of 0.01%. In 8/10 patients, levels of mutant BRAF fell with clinical response and/or rose with disease progression. In 3 of these 8 patients, samples drawn 10 days to 2 months prior to imaging studies showed increased levels of BRAF mutant DNA prior to evidence of disease progression.

Up-regulation of growth factor receptor such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) or insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) is among the mechanisms underlying BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate for the first time that up-regulation of PDGFR, a growth factor receptor which markedly differs in its functional properties from its family member PDGFR, causes BRAF-I resistance in vitro and in vivo. PDGFR inhibition by PDGFR-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNAs) and by clinically available PDGFR inhibitors (sunitinib, imatinib and crenolanib) restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFR up-regulation is mediated by Sonic Hedgehog Homolog (Shh) pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly to PDGFR inhibition, Shh inhibition by the novel small molecule LDE225 restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. These effects are mediated by PDGFR down-regulation and by inhibition of ERK and AKT activation. The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by the association of PDGFR up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I +/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and less tumor regression. These findings suggest that monitoring patients for early PDGFR up-regulation will facilitate the identification of those who may benefit from the treatment with BRAF-I in combination with clinically approved PDGFR or Shh inhibitors\"]",

The most common BRAF mutation (V600E) occurs in approximately 70% of primary melanomas and 10% of colorectal cancers. Melanoma patients carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation respond with frequency of 80% to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, while colon cancer patients respond at a rate of 5% only, indicative of intrinsic resistance. Moreover, clinical benefit is further limited by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance among vemurafenib responders. Combination therapy targeting both BRAF(V600E) and possible escape pathways appears to be a promising approach to reverse resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular characterization and in vitro chemosensitivity profiles of 20 melanoma and 20 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Four of the colon and 11 of the melanoma cell lines were established at Oncotest from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Molecular profiles include the mutation status of BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS (exon sequencing) and protein levels for components of the MAPK, EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways (Western blot analysis). Sensitivity profiles for inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, EGFR and PI3K were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based survival and proliferation assay. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors was investigated by combination of vemurafenib with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or inhibitors of potential escape pathways like EGFR, PI3K/AKT or c-MET and evaluated by combination index according to Chou-Talalay.In line with the clinical situation, the BRAF V600E substitution was found in 13/20 (65%) of the melanoma and only in 4/20 (20%) of the colon cancer cell lines. BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in melanoma cell lines and KRAS mutations did not occur at all. Among the colon cancer cell lines, in addition to the BRAF(v600E) mutation, alteration in KRAS (10/20 cell lines), PIK3CA (6/20) and NRAS (1/20) were detected. Chemosensitivity profiling revealed intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors for 3/13 (23%) BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and for 3/4 (75%) BRAF(V600E) colon cancer cell lines. Reversal of the resistance of BRAF inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cell lines was recorded as synergism between vemurafenib and inhibitors of vasious kinases (c-MET, AKT, PI3K, MEK, or EGFR. A particularly strong synergistic interaction was found for vemurafenib and the c-MET inhibitor SU11274, irrespective of BRAF status. For colon cancer cell lines, the strongest synergisms were detected for the combinations of vemurafenib with inhibitors of c-MET, EGFR, PI3K, AKT and MEK.Displaying similar mutation and chemosensitivity profiles as melanomas and colon cancers in the clinic, the present cell line panels represent valuable tools to investigate the reversal of resistance towards BRAF inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['INTRODUCTION', ' BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations occur in over half of all human melanomas. BRAF-mutant tumors are highly sensitive to small molecule inhibitors directed against the oncogenic BRAF protein. However, in tumors that lack the specific mutation, patients have few effective therapeutic options. To address the need for new therapies for patients with BRAF-wild-type (wt) melanoma, we hypothesized that the inhibition of the major nuclear export receptor CRM1 would result in nuclear accumulation of nuclear proteins, increase apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest independent of BRAF mutational status. To test our hypothesis, we examined the effects of a novel CRM1 inhibitor on melanoma cell lines with various BRAF and NRAS mutational backgrounds. METHODS', ' We used human malignant melanoma cell lines with BRAF mutation (Sk-Mel-28, A375, Mel-624, UACC903, MalMe-3M), BRAF-wt (MeWo) and BRAF-wt and NRAS mutation (Hs940T) to assess the effects of CRM1 inhibition, BRAF inhibition (PLX4032) or MEK inhibition (U0126) using both mono- or combination therapy. MTT assays were used to evaluate the effects of treatment on cell proliferation. FACS analysis with annexin/PI staining was performed to assess effects on cell cycle and cell death. The Chou-Talalay method was used to assess synergistic drug combination effects. Treatment effects on cleaved caspase-3, PARP cleavage, P53, and FOXO3 were analyzed by western blot analysis. RESULTS', ' As mono therapy, CRM1 inhibition led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and an increase in apoptosis in both BRAF wt and mutant cell lines. The degree of inhibition and cell death achieved by CRM1 inhibition across all melanoma cell lines is comparable to the results achieved by BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 in BRAF mutant cell lines. Furthermore, the combination of CRM1 inhibition and BRAF inhibition results in a strongly synergistic combination against BRAF mutant cell lines with a statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSION', ' We found that relative to other cancer cell types, both BRAF-mutant and BRAF-wt melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to CRM1 inhibition. In addition, CRM1 inhibition significantly enhanced the effect of PLX4032 in BRAF-mutant cell lines, suggesting that the combination of these two drugs may address the emergence of acquired resistance to BRAF monotherapy. Based on these results, CRM1 inhibition warrants further investigation to determine its potential benefit in treating melanoma patients independent of BRAF mutation status.']",

        "Background":"[\"Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways initiate with external signaling, proceed through a sequence of protein kinases, and alter cell proliferation, growth, and survival. MAPK pathways proceed through a well-ordered sequence but are interconnected and modified by the cell's internal needs. The MEK-catalyzed phosphorylation of its target ERK represents the most selective interaction of MAPK signaling cascades. The type III MEK1/2 inhibitor, Mekinist, was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. This success suggests inhibitors of other MEK/ERK cascades may be reasonable strategies for anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. Despite the likely involvement of MEK5 phosphorylation of ERK5 in early and triple negative breast cancers, prostate cancer, and renal cancer, little work has been focused on developing selective MEK5 inhibitors. We have previously described an initial series of anthranilic acid derivatives structurally derived from the known non-selective MEK inhibitor PD0325901. To explore structural requirements for selective inhibition of MEK5 versus MEK1/2, aryl substitution and the role of proposed internal hydrogen bonding of the ligand were examined with novel compounds. These were tested at 10 M in MDB-MB-213 cells subsequently treated with EGF to induce MEK1/2 and MEK5 phosphorylation. Western blot analysis following electrophoresis using IR-tagged antibodies raised against pERK1/2, pERK5, ERK1/2, or ERK5 permitted determination of total and relative inhibition of MEK-mediated generation of pERK. Incubation with PD0325901 resulted in full suppression of both pERK1/2 and pERK5. For the aryl substitutions examined, omission of the halogens on the pendant phenyl group (SC-1-181) abolished MEK1/2 inhibition(0% decrease in pERK1/2) yet retained good MEK5 inhibition (82% decrease in pERK5). Disruption of an internal nitrogen-acyl hydrogen bond preferentially decreased MEK5 inhibition (SC-2-32\", ' 40% and 16% decrease in pERK5 and pERK1/2 respectively).

We studied this phenomenon as a mechanism of adaptive resistance to BRAF inhibition since melanomas with both MITF high and low have been reported to result in BRAF inhibitor resistance. We treated 17 BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib for short term (3 days) or long term (17 days), and compared them to no treatment or TNF treated conditions. We profiled them phenotypically for MART1 antigen (differentiated phenotype) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR, neural crest phenotype) expression by flow cytometry. Results comparing median fluorescence intensity (MFI) showed a wide spectrum of adaptive responses to short term BRAF inhibition, followed by solidification or further evolution of these changes upon long term exposure and development of drug tolerance. According to each cell line distribution, we calculated a (x,y) value that organized the cell lines and conditions in four quadrants according to MART1 (x axis) or NGFR (y axis) expression. Two double negative (MART1-/NGFR-) cell lines that were unaffected by treatment and stayed in the same quadrant. Seven MART1-/NGFR+ and four MART1+/NGFR- cell lines slightly changed phenotype with vemurafenib exposure but stayed in the same quadrant. Four cell lines with MART1+/NGFR+ phenotype were greatly influenced by treatment, showing wide plasticity with cells shifting towards NGFR+/MART1- and others towards NGFR-/MART1+. Changes in position between baseline and tolerance to vemurafenib after 17days treatment were numerically quantified as an inferred number from plasticity. Cell lines with double positive (MART1+/NGFR+) phenotype had a significant change in plasticity compared to the rest of cell lines in other quadrants (p = 0.0004). This arranges cells in a four-quadrant pattern that could be likened to a U-turn toward de-differentiation. Cells that de-differentiated with BRAF inhibition mimicked the effect induced by TNF. This effect was driven by a decrease in MITF activity confirmed with a tyrosinase promoter-luciferase assay. In conclusion, baseline melanoma differentiation phenotypes guide the phenotype switch response, with those double positive for differentiation and neural crest markers being at a semi-stable state that can be prone to different plastic changes upon BRAF inhibition.']",

Despite current progress in the identification of promising drugs for treating melanoma, drug resistance has emerged as a serious issue indicating that novel therapeutic strategies may be required. It is well documented that the process of converting the epithelial tumorigenic cell to a mesenchymal phenotype, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is responsible for conferring an invasive phenotype to cancer cells. An EMT-like process has been shown to occur during melanoma progression. High-mobility-protein AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is a multi-function transcription factor linked to oncogenesis and EMT in a variety of cancers. HMGA2 is a small DNA-binding protein with three “AT-hook” DNA-binding motifs that specifically recognize the minor groove of AT-rich DNA sequences. HMGA2 is significantly upregulated in human primary melanoma and metastases, including those with BRAF mutations. We accessed the potential application of netropsin, a potent inhibitor of HMGA2-DNA interactions, as an EMT blocking agent of BRAF mutated melanoma cells. Three murine melanoma cells lines that carry mutations in the BRAF gene and show resistance to vemurafenib (D4M, YUMM1.1, and YUMM1.7) were used. Cells were treated with EMT Inducing Media Supplement along with Netropsin and the expression of E-cadherin as well as their migratory behavior were evaluated. Netropsin treatment of EMT induced cells was not cytotoxic, prevented changes in cell morphology, maintained high levels of E-cadherin expression and decreased migratory behavior. All three cell lines express HMGA2 which continues to be expressed in the tumors resulting from subcutaneous injections in mice. YUMM1.1 cells showed the highest levels of expression of HMGA2 amongst the three cell lines. Interestingly, in our preliminary study only YUMM1.1-derived tumors generated overt metastasis in the lung 30 days after the injections. Altogether our data showed that Netropsin is capable of blocking EMT of murine BRAF mutated melanoma cells.

Physiologic activation of the pathway is limited by ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAS activation and other components of the pathway. Oncogenic mutations and translocations of RAF family members have been identified in many human tumors and serve as drivers of tumor growth. We now show that these mutants are active despite feedback inhibition of RAS and that this is associated with dysregulated ERK output. All translocations and almost all of the RAF mutants tested so far form RAS-independent constitutive dimers, the activity of which is dependent on their dimerization. Mutations at one site, V600E and V600K allow RAF to function as a monomer in cells with low RAS activity and as a RAS-dependent dimer in cells with adequate RAS activity. In tumors expressing any of these mutants, RAF/MEK/ERK activity is elevated despite feedback inhibition of RAS. Currently available RAF inhibitors bind to one protomer of the RAF dimer and cause negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. This is sometimes associated with transactivation of the unbound protomer. These inhibitors cannot be used to inhibit ERK signaling in tumors in which ERK is driven by RAF-dimers (those with mutant RAS, NF1 loss, atypical RAF mutations, RAF translocations.) In contrast, in tumors with V600E BRAF mutations, ERK causes strong feedback inhibition of RAS and V600E BRAF exists as a monomer that is inhibited by these drugs. Acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors usually results from a molecular lesion that causes RAS-dependent or independent dimerization of V600E (NRAS mutation, V600E BRAF amplification, V600E aberrantly spliced isoform.) Current RAF inhibitors inhibit V600E BRAF dimers at concentrations 10-100 fold greater than those required to inhibit the corresponding monomer in cells. We take this as a provisional measure of the degree of negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. We have now identified inhibitors that inhibit V600E dimers at concentrations close (1-3 fold higher) than those required to inhibit the monomer. They do not cause dissociation of dimers and their inhibition is abolished by gatekeeper mutations. Phenotypically, therefore, binding of these compounds to dimers is associated with only minimal negative cooperativity. These drugs inhibit ERK signaling and the proliferation of tumor cells with atypical BRAF mutations and translocations as well as V600E melanoma models with acquired resistance to Vemurafenib. However, they are much less active in cancer cells with KRAS mutation or receptor-dependent activation of RAF. Selective inhibitors of subsets of RAF dimers may allow effective ERK inhibition of large subset of tumors without inhibiting signaling in normal cells.']",

One mechanism of resistance to current melanoma treatments is upregulation of SOX2, a transcription factor that is essential for tumor growth and expansion, particularly in tumors with BRAF mutation in melanoma. Targeting drugs to transcription factors has been elusive and limits treatment options. Here we report that the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp9x controls SOX2. We show that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (Usp9x), a deubiquitinases (DUB) enzyme, binds SOX2 in melanoma and deubiquitinates SOX2 in vitro. Usp9x knockdown results in increased levels of ubiquitinated SOX2 in melanoma, is coupled with depletion of SOX2 and promotes apoptosis synergistically with vemurafenib in melanoma cell lines. Protein levels in primary melanoma tumor samples demonstrated moderately elevated Usp9x/SOX2 protein expression in metastatic melanoma compared to primary melanoma patient tumors. Further, Usp9x knockdown or inhibition with G9, a DUB inhibitor, blocked BRAF/MEK kinase inhibitor-induced induction of SOX2 and fully suppressed in vitro colony growth of BRAF-mutant melanoma cells and promoted apoptosis.

In some patients, molecularly targeted therapies may be compromised due to heterogeneity among tumor subclones. In this study we compared conventional DNA sequencing with a fluorescent-based mutant-specific PCR (MS-PCR) assay to detect the BRAF hotspot mutation V600E in a large panel of patient tumors, including paired primary and metastatic tumors from individual patients. Methods', ' BRAF MS-PCR and conventional sequencing were performed on DNA from 304 tumors (112 melanoma, 110 ovarian, 82 prostate) to determine the presence of the BRAFV600E hot-spot mutation. Among the melanomas were 18 matched primary and metastatic specimens, and 40 metastatic specimens from 19 patients, each of whom had 2 or more metastases. Results', ' DNA sequencing detected mutations in 5/110 (4.5%) ovarian tumors, 1/82 (1.2%) prostate tumors, and 36/112 (32%) melanomas.

Among 18 patients with matched primary and metastatic melanoma, 8/18 (44%) had discordant results including 2 patients with mutant primary tumors and wild-type metastases; among the 19 patients with multiple metastases 5/19 (26%) had discordant (both wild-type and mutant) tumors. Conclusions', ' Using a highly sensitive BRAF mutation detection method, we observed substantial evidence for heterogeneity within clinical tumor specimens. This was especially true in melanoma samples, where multiple specimens from individual patients differed with respect to the presence of the mutant BRAF allele. These results suggest that failures of molecularly targeted therapies, such as those directed against mutant BRAF, may be due in part to a lack of clonality among the tumors under treatment.']",

        "Background":"['Activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutations occur in 50% of melanoma, 45% of papillary thyroid cancer and 10% of colon cancer. BRAF inhibitors have elicited significant clinical response in melanomas but acquired resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Therefore, consideration of new treatment strategies to block activity of mutant BRAF and deter therapeutic resistance is warranted. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone required for the stability of hundreds of client proteins, including the RAF family of kinases, and has emerged as a highly relevant anticancer target. Ganetespib is a second generation, small molecule HSP90 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials. To investigate the potential for ganetespib in the treatment of melanoma we evaluated its preclinical activity as monotherapy, and in combination with targeted agents, in cells sensitive or resistant to BRAF inhibitors. Ganetespib displayed potent anticancer activity in a large panel of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma, thyroid and colon cancer cell lines, with IC50 between 4 and 40 nM. Further analysis showed that ganetespib disrupted oncogenic signaling by inducing the destabilization of mutant BRAF and subsequent inactivation of MEK and ERK. Levels of wild-type BRAF were only slightly reduced in response to ganetespib treatment, implying that the stability of activated BRAF is more reliant on HSP90 and that ganetespib may selectively deplete oncogenic forms of BRAF. Notably, ganetespib treatment also led to depletion of CRAF, which is implicated in driving therapeutic resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In an effort to maximize antitumor activity, we combined low levels of ganetespib with BRAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and observed increased cytotoxicity compared to single agent treatment. Both the BRAF and MEK inhibitors were cytostatic on their own, which may be due to continued PI3K/mTOR signaling. We subsequently assayed the combination of ganetespib with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and observed synergistic increases in cell death. Importantly, ganetespib was capable of blocking the feedback activation on MAPKK induced by a MEK inhibitor as well as the activation of ERK by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. To determine if these results translated in vivo, similar combinations were performed in BRAF mutant human melanoma xenografts. Co-administration of ganetespib with either a BRAF or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppressed in vivo tumor growth to a greater extent compared to monotherapy. Finally, we show that ganetespib effectively blocked MAPK signaling and killed RPMI-7951 melanoma cells (IC50 = 4 nM), which are resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors due to the overexpression of COT. In conclusion, targeting HSP90 with ganetespib represents a promising approach for the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-driven cancers and may be especially relevant in the context of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.']",

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is particularly important for the survival and proliferation of melanoma cells and somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS are frequently observed in melanoma. Recently, it has been reported that the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib showed high response rates and improved overall survival in melanomas with BRAF-activating mutations. However, as BRAF inhibitors induce RAF paradoxical activation via RAF dimerization in BRAF wild-type cells, rapid emergence of acquired resistance and secondary skin tumors as well as presence of few effective treatment options for melanoma bearing wild-type BRAF (including NRAS mutant melanoma) are clinical concerns. In this preclinical study, we describe the biological characterization of TAK-632 as a potent and selective pan-RAF inhibitor that suppresses RAF activity in BRAF wild-type cells with minimal RAF paradoxical activation. We used both genetic and chemical approaches to investigate the dependence of NRAS-mutated melanoma and BRAF inhibitor-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cells on RAF. Our analysis reveals that the MAPK pathway and proliferation of these cells is highly dependent on RAF. Such dependence was not observed in several RAS/RAF-wild type and KRAS-mutated cells. We also show that TAK-632 induces RAF dimerization but inhibits the kinase activity of the RAF dimer, probably because of its slow dissociation from RAF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of TAK-632 and various MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors exhibits synergistic anti-proliferative effects on these cells.

Our aim is to identify new drug combinations that are synergistic in BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma, a sub-type representing 30% of cases for which targeted therapies are not currently available. We high-throughput screened a collection of 20 BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines with 180 drug combinations (60 library drugs used at 5 different concentrations combined with 3 clinically relevant anchor drugs) and generated over 8000 survival curves . We found that 25% of cell lines are highly sensitive to a combination of nilotinib plus trametinib and confirmed this finding with 2 independent assays. We further validated the drug synergy firstly using an independent collection of BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines (n=7), then a collection of BRAF/NRAS wild type patient derived xenotransplant cultures (n=3), and finally with a collection of BRAFV600E and NRASQ61 melanoma cell lines (n=12). Further, we generated a gene expression signature of cell lines that display synergy for the nilotinib/trametinib combination, and used it to classify human melanomas from Leeds Melanoma Project (N=171) and TCGA (n=470) cohorts. Tumors classified as “synergistic-like” (27.9 and 36.7%, respectively) are associated to decreased overall and recurrence free survival (P<0.05), suggesting that our combination might be effective in a relevant fraction of aggressive tumors. In order to identify drug resistance mechanisms we deployed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen. We found that loss of the tuberous sclerosis complex can confer resistance to nilotinib/trametinib, and validated this mechanism using clonal engineered lines. Since tuberous sclerosis complex genes are mutated in 10% of melanomas, this approach can help to identify patients potentially refractory to the treatment. We also investigated the molecular mechanism of nilotinib/trametinib synergy by analysing the level of several phosphoproteins upon treatment. We discovered that the nilotinib/trametinib combination synergistically reduce the level of P-ERK in synergistic cell lines but not in cell lines resistant to the drug combination, thus pointing out the MAPK pathway dependence of the synergy. This finding provides a putative marker to identify tumors responsive to the treatment. Finally, we tested in vivo the nilotinib/trametinib combination in a patient derived xenotransplant mouse model and showed that the combination is well tolerated and significantly more effective than the 2 drugs alone (P<0.01).

To improve BRAF targeted therapy, we characterized a panel of BRAFV600 mutant melanoma cell lines and determined their response to cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell signaling changes by GSK2118436 alone and in combination with the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458. Nine of 11 BRAFV600E, 4/5 BRAFV600K and 1/1 BRAFV600D mutant lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 (IC50<0.3M). These sensitive lines had wild-type MEK1/2 with or without PTEN mutations. Two of the three lines insensitive to GSK2118436 had either MEK1P124S or MEK2K66_K68del mutations. GSK2118436 treatment decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and cyclin D1 in both the sensitive and insensitive lines. However, GSK2118436 decreased S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation (pS6P) only in the sensitive lines. Cell lines sensitive to GSK2118436 were also sensitive to the allosteric MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 (IC50<0.01M). The combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 had a synergistic to additive effect on cell growth inhibition in the sensitive lines, but had minimal benefit in the three insensitive lines. Although 5/6 PTEN NULL lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 based on their IC50s, growth of these lines was inhibited less effectively by GSK2118436 compared to the PTEN WT lines evaluated by IC70. PTEN NULL cells displayed higher levels of basal AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) than PTEN WT lines. Treatment of PTEN NULL lines with GSK2118436 increased pAKT while similar treatment of PTEN WT lines decreased pAKT and increased PTEN expression. In combination with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458, GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 effectively inhibited MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR signaling, enhanced cell growth inhibition, and induced apoptosis evaluated by caspase 3/7 activation and/or PARP cleavage in both PTEN WT and PTEN NULL lines. In PTEN deficient lines, these combinations were more effective than the combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212. These results indicate MEK1/2 mutations associate with lack of sensitivity to single agent BRAF and MEK inhibitors. In addition, PTEN deficiency may reduce the effectiveness of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. The combination of GSK2118436 with GSK1120212 or GSK2126458 may improve the effectiveness of BRAF targeted therapy in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma. Our results support the testing of GSK2118436 with these combinations in the clinic and warrant further investigation of MEK and PTEN mutation status and pS6P as a pharmacodynamic marker to improve treatment outcome in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Early clinical studies have shown that concurrent administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, dabrafenib and trametinib, is more active in patients with BRAFV600E/K melanoma than either single agent alone. Even though the combination of BRAF/MEK inhibitors is initially highly effective in treating melanoma in a subset of patients, progression to resistance ultimately occurscommonly via reactivation of the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to counter primary resistance and prevent the emergence of secondary resistance are needed. Following pharmacological or progressive genetic perturbations, dynamic and system-wide adaptive changes (reprogramming) in the expression and activity of multiple kinases (collectively termed the kinome) clearly occur in tumor cells. Rich networks of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, many of which are understudied, are integrated into the signaling systems controlled by oncogenes known to drive melanoma. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the kinome at baseline, during the adaptive response to kinase inhibitor treatment, and in the context of acquired resistance is critical. We use Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs), mixtures of covalently immobilized, linker-adapted kinase inhibitors coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), to assess changes in activation of kinases in untreated samples, during acute inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK and in the context of acquired resistance. Our enhanced MIB/MS technology allows us to study over 75-80% of the expressed kinome (and numerous lipid and metabolic kinases) simultaneously using lysates from cell lines, genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) tumors, patient-derived xenografts or human melanoma. We have identified several kinases (e.g. PDGFR, DDR1, MAP3K1) that are activated upon acute treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, or dabrafenib/trametinib as well as in drug-resistant human melanoma cells and BRAFV600E/PTEN-/- GEMM-derived tumors and cell lines. Thus, studies using MIB/MS to measure dynamic kinome responses have identified kinases that have not been previously shown to be involved in the adaptive response to BRAF and/or MEK inhibition. We are currently targeting kinases involved in adaptive kiome reprogramming, pharmacologically or by RNAi, to determine whether their activation leads to vulnerability. This work will lead to the identification of novel and rationally predicted therapies for patients with advanced melanoma.']",

Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and more effective targeted therapies for this devastating disease. The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type. This landmark study highlighted the important role of the previously understudied NF1 tumor suppressor in melanoma pathogenesis, especially for the 9% of melanoma patients who have acquired inactivating NF1-mutations, but lack hotspot mutations that activate BRAF or RAS. To date, animal models have not been developed for the NF1-mutant subtype of melanoma, which has significantly impaired the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this subtype. Here we report the first zebrafish model for NF1-mutant melanoma, which we generated by combining the loss of nf1 with loss of both pten and p53. The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas. Thus our model appears ideal for the testing of drugs that will prove uniquely active for the significant subset of NF1-mutant, BRAF/NRAS-wildtype human melanomas.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is notorious for the ability to change its phenotype in response to signals from the microenvironment, which might influence how melanoma responds to therapy. We have disclosed an association between fibroblast-induced phenotypic alterations in melanoma and resistance to the mutated BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (BRAFi). This signifies the need to find other targets than BRAF to eliminate stroma-influenced melanoma cells. To approach this challenge, we performed proteomic analysis and cancer drug sensitivity screening, comparing fibroblast-supported versus non-supported melanoma cells. We showed that the effect of fibroblasts was critically dependent on cell-cell proximity, where melanoma cells get trapped in a fibronectin network, produced by adjacent fibroblasts. In such environment, melanoma cells down-regulate melanocytic programs (MITF-driven), gain mesenchymal features (AXL, PDGFR, fibronectin) and activate stress/inflammatory-response signaling pathways (JNK and STAT3). Altogether, this indicates fibroblast-induced melanoma transition to a de-differentiated, mesenchymal-like, pro-inflammatory phenotype. Melanoma cells with such phenotype were less responsive to BRAF/MAPK inhibitors and a number of other targeted drugs. However, they showed enhanced sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and, particularly, an inhibitor of GSK3b, stimulating Wnt/b-catenin signaling. Further, we employed flow cytometry to measure the levels of Ki67 and pS6 in single melanoma cells upon different conditions/treatments. Such analysis allowed discrimination of cell subpopulations representing a proliferative and a quiescent cellular state, and nicely reflected the influence of the tested drugs in the presence or absence of fibroblasts. We observed a subpopulation of proliferative pS6high/Ki67high melanoma cells, which remained after treatment with BRAFi if fibroblasts were present. This, fibroblast-protected BRAFi-resistant cell subpopulation, could be reduced/eliminated by PI3K or GSK3b inhibitors, verifying PI3K/GSK3 as potential targets in fibroblast-rich tumors. Currently, we are using mass cytometry (CyTOF) to further characterize cell subpopulations with respect to multiple markers related to cell signaling and immune interactions. Preliminary results indicate that not only signaling protein levels, but also levels of immunoregulatory proteins are altered in melanoma cells that get support from the fibroblasts. In conclusion, we demonstrate fibroblast-induced melanoma switching to a mesenchymal-like pro-inflammatory phenotype, which favors melanoma resistance to BRAF inhibitors, but sensitizes to inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR-associated signaling. CyTOF-analysis of complex tumor-stroma cell systems is used to search for additional strategies to target stroma-supported melanoma cells, either at the level of signaling, or immune interactions.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and the leading cause of death from skin disease. The BRAF(V600E) mutation is found in approximately 60% of melanomas. It causes constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in these tumors leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) induces apoptosis in melanoma cells which has been used as the basis for molecular targeted therapy of melanoma. Small-molecule compounds such as Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and other selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors specifically bind BRAF(V600E), and have been shown to cause dramatic, but transient, tumor regression in vivo. The precise mechanisms of cell death following BRAF inhibition remain obscure; the literature posits a diversity of ways in which apoptosis is induced. However, it is unclear whether a single but complex network is involved or whether mechanisms differ from one cell type to the next. This is an important issue because use of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma is seriously challenged by the absence of durable responses; even in initially responsive patients tumors usually re-emerge within months and are observed to be drug resistant. An important challenge is thus to understand determinants of initial sensitivity to BRAF inhibition beyond V600E mutation and to determine which of these are involved in resistance.Using high throughput measurement of the abundance and state of modification of multiple proteins representing diverse signaling pathways at the basal level and over time in multiple melanoma cell lines exposed to different doses of BRAF inhibitors and data-driven mathematical modeling, we determine how the complex dynamics of signaling pathways are controlled in different cell lines and how drugs targeting BRAF(V600E) alter this signaling. Our analysis shows that the basal level of some proteins such as PTEN, pERK, pS6, pAkt, and -catenin vary up to 100-fold among different lines prior drug treatment. Further, these cell lines show different degrees of oncogene addiction and remarkable diversity with respect to the level of ERK inhibition and apoptosis as well as activation or inhibition of other signaling cascades following BRAF inhibition. We use mathematical modeling to relate basal levels of signaling proteins and their dynamics following BRAF inhibition to pharmacological descriptors of sensitivity to multiple BRAF drugs. Thus, we identify key signaling nodes within the signaling networks of the melanoma cells which determine the differential phenotypic consequences of BRAF inhibition. This approach will be critical for predicting and ultimately improving drug sensitivity in resistant tumors (e.g. via co-treatment strategies).']",

Potent and specific BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib are superior to chemotherapy in treatment of BRAF mutant melanomas which represent nearly 50% of all melanomas.

SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-2 cells were cultured in MEM media containing 10% serum and plated in 96-well culture plates for 24 hours then treated with DT3 (0-40 M), simvastatin (0-5 M), or a combination and dosed again at 48 hours.

Membranes were incubated with antibodies against Hsp 70 (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), Hsp 90 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), pS6 and pBAD (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA).Using MTS assay, we found that DT3 (IC50 38.8 M) and simvastatin (IC50 22.7M) have cytotoxic effects on melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28, but on the SK-MEL-2 cells DT3 does not have an effect at the concentrations studied (10-40 M DT3) yet simvastatin (IC50 16.9 M) does have cytotoxicity. Further studies determined that combinations of these drugs display a synergistic effect on SK-MEL-28 by inhibition of pS6 and pBAD and subsequent apoptosis. However, these effects are not observed in SK-MEL-2 cells; treated SK-MEL-2 cells show over-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggestive of a rescue effect leading to lesser cytotoxic activity. The selective cytotoxicity observed in BRAF-mutated cells and not in wild type BRAF melanoma cell lines by both DT3 and simvastatin warrants further research into the potential therapeutic use of these combinations. This observation has added importance in the light of recent findings that show the acquisition of BRAF mutation is an early event in melanogenesis and hence these compounds may have a key role in chemoprevention approaches to melanoma.']",

Here we show that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X), a deubiquitinating enzyme whose expression is elevated in melanoma, binds and deubiquitinates AXIN1. USP9X knockdown resulted in increased ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated depletion of AXIN1 (but not AXIN2), resulting in a reduction in AXIN1 cellular half-life. USP9X knockdown elevated -catenin response genes (>2-fold) in melanoma cells treated with Wnt3A. USP9X depletion also increased apoptotic responsiveness to Wnt3A or BRAF/MEK inhibitor and overcame BRAF inhibitor resistance in A375R cells. In contrast, USP34 which was previously shown to regulate AXIN1 (and AXIN2) deubiquitination, did not alter AXIN1 levels or apoptotic responsiveness in melanoma. A previously identified small molecule USP9X inhibitor (EOAI3402143 or G9) replicated the effects of USP9X knockdown on AXIN1 depletion in vitro and in vivo, suppressed melanoma tumor growth in animals and fully blocked in vivo tumor growth when combined with BRAF kinase inhibitor. Thus, we identify USP9X as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma and established G9 as a lead compound for the development of AXIN1 depleting agents that may add to the targeted therapies already used in the treatment of melanoma.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['RAF kinase inhibitors have shown substantial therapeutic effects in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. However, despite impressive initial responses, therapeutic effects are often temporary due to acquired resistance. This resistance highlights the need to identify therapeutic approaches to improve the durability of responses to RAF inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel inhibitor of p53-Mdm2 interaction, NVP-CGM097, causes marked reduction of melanoma cell viability. The activation of p53 signaling and consequent reduction in cell viability required wild-type p53, but was independent of BRAF status. Moreover, combined inhibition of Mdm2, using NVP-CGM097, and BRAF using NVP-LGX818, synergistically inhibited the viability of BRAF mutant melanoma cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. NVP-CGM097 caused induction of p21 and Bax, while NVP-LGX818 did not. Instead, NVP-LGX818 caused induction of p27 and Bim. Therefore, together they induced a complementary set of anti-proliferative and apoptosis stimulating molecules, which resulted in strong synergistic antitumor effects. In vivo, the combination treatment resulted in sustained tumor regressions and markedly prolonged survival relative to either single agent. Collectively, these data show that activation of p53, through inhibition of Mdm2, leads to antitumor effects in melanoma. Furthermore, the data show that concomitant activation of tumor suppressor p53 and inhibition of BRAF synergistically suppresses melanoma growth. Therefore, combined inhibition of Mdm2 and BRAF in melanoma may provide an effective therapeutic modality capable of overcoming the resistance observed with the BRAF inhibitor monotherapy and thus lead to more durable responses in the clinic.']",

        "Background":"['Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of BRAF V600E-positive metastatic melanoma after a phase III clinical trial demonstrated improved survival in patients taking vemurafenib compared to dacarbazine. As the first personalized treatment for metastatic melanoma to show a survival benefit, vemurafenib is a major breakthrough in the field. Although tumors in patients frequently shrink significantly within weeks of initiation of treatment, resistance eventually develops in many patients, with a median progression free survival of approximately 7 months. Evaluation of the biomarker and phenotypic correlates of response are difficult to determine as paired pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies generally only represent one on-treatment time point when available. A better in vivo understanding of the effects of BRAF inhibitor-treatment of relevant mouse models may yield insights into the nature of the clinical response and subsequent relapse. The conditional BRAF/PTEN mouse model of melanoma that we co-developed is ideal to study this process. In this non-xenograft model, expression of BRAF V600E and loss of PTEN is under control of the Cre-Lox recombination system. Expression of the Cre recombinase is under control of the tyrosinase promoter, ensuring that recombination is limited to melanocytes. The Cre recombinase is fused to an estrogen receptor that inhibits the activity of the recombinase. Activation of the Cre recombinase requires topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for induction of recombination at specific time points in the life span of the mouse. The use of this mouse model allows for more thorough evaluation of the time course and phenotype of BRAF-inhibitor response in melanoma in an immunocompetent host.

Cell proliferation assay was performed using Cell Titer Blue assay. Western blotting was performed to determine the expression of PARP, caspases-9, LC3A/B,Beclin1, pERK, pMEK, AMPKa, p70S6, and p4E-BP1. GAPDH was used as internal control. Autophagy was further analyzed with immunofluorescence with LC-3 and NECN1 anti-antibody for visualization of lysosomal morphology and evaluated under the Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (20). DAPI was used to counter stain the nucleus. Apoptosis was further analyzed with flow cytometry using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences).

Addition of M to PA combination had synergistic effect on the anti-melanoma proliferative effect of PA. Significantly increased expression (p<0.05) of apoptosis markers (PARP and caspases-9) and autophagy markers (LC3B and Beclin1) were observed in cells treated with PAM compared with PA. Enhanced induction of autophagy with the triple drugs was confirmed by visualization of autophagosome and autolysosome formation on immunofluorescence. Synergistic effect on apoptosis was confirmed on Annexin V assay. The PAM combination treatment also lead to significant enhancement of AMPK activation and increased phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 compared with metformin alone (p<0.01). The addition of M to PA combination resulted in inhibition of mTOR signaling with decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 in treated cancer cells, when compared with PA or M alone.Conclusion', ' We have observed a synergistic effect on suppressing human melanoma proliferation with the addition of metformin to combined inhibition of mutant BRAF and MEK.

        "Background":"['Metabolic reprogramming is considered to be one of the major hallmarks of cancer. Selective inhibitors of mutant BRAFV600E, are a widely used targeted therapy for melanoma. Unfortunately, acquired drug resistance, which commonly occurs, represents a major limitation to clinical efficacy. Recent studies have highlighted the role of BRAF inhibition in promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), over glycolysis, in BRAFV600E melanomas, a switch commonly seen in conjunction with development of drug resistance. This metabolic switch occurs at the transcriptional level, indicated by the up-regulation of PGC1 through the lineage-specific transcription factor MITF. Based on these data, we propose that increased OXPHOS is required for melanoma cells to acquire resistance against the BRAF inhibition, which supports our investigation of the therapeutic benefit of combining BRAF and OXPHOS inhibitors. For the latter, respiratory Complex I, an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a logical target for OXPHOS inhibition.We investigated the molecular, metabolic and bioenergetic effects of a selective mutant BRAF inhibitor (Vemurafenib/PLX4032) and BAY 87-2243, a small molecule inhibiting respiratory Complex I, in vitro using various BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. First, our study revealed that BRAF inhibition increased the expression of mitochondrial genes and mitochondrial respiration, which is associated with elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress, independent of the expression of PGC1. Furthermore, BAY 87-2243 inhibited OXPHOS, down-regulated the expression of mitochondrial genes and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We also demonstrated that inhibition of BRAF increased the OXPHOS phenotype and therefore enhanced the effect of BAY 87-2243 on mitochondrial metabolism; the combination of both inhibitors showed synergistic effects in vitro.Interestingly, long term BRAF inhibition resulted in BRAFV600E melanoma cells to become resistant to BAY 87-2243. Preliminary studies suggest that melanoma cells pretreated with a BRAF inhibitor, with higher rates of mitochondrial respiration and elevated ROS levels, are prone to cell death when targeted by pro-oxidants. Further studies are currently ongoing to understand this resistance phenotype as well as the underlying mechanism which drives the synergistic drug effect.']",

Remodeling of Ca2+ homeostasis during malignancy is caused by the rearrangement of the Ca2+ signaling machinery, including Ca2+ pumps, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and channels. Plasma membrane calcium ATPases (ATP2B - or PMCA) maintain the resting low intracellular calcium concentration by pumping out excess calcium from the cytosol. Changes in PMCA expression during malignant transformation have been described previously in colorectal and breast cancer cells, and most recently by our group in melanomas. We found that in BRAF mutant melanoma cells the PMCA 4b protein level was markedly elevated by BRAF inhibitor treatment. Overexpression of PMCA4b suppressed motility and metastatic potential. Previously, it was shown that HDAC inhibitors-induced differentiation up-regulated PMCA4b expression in gastric, colon and breast cancer cells. In the present study we treated BRAF mutant and BRAF wild type melanoma cells with HDAC inhibitors (SAHA (suberanilohydroxamic acid) or valproic acid) and tested the changes in abundance, localization and function of PMCA4b. Expression levels of the PMCA proteins were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western Blotting. Subcellular localization of the PMCAs and the effects of treatments on cytosolic Ca2+ signaling were analyzed by confocal microscopy. We found that treatment with the HDAC inhibitors increased the level of PMCA4b expression at both mRNA and protein levels in both BRAF wild type and BRAF mutant cell types. The increased PMCA4b level was coupled with enhanced plasma membrane localization and with a faster Ca2+ clearance after stimulation. Our results show that in melanoma cells the expression of PMCA4b is under epigenetic control and HDAC inhibitors efficiently enhanced PMCA4b expression independent of the BRAF status of cells.']",

        "Background":"['BET proteins recognize histone acetylation marks and play an essential role in transcription elongation. BRD4, the best studied family member, binds to the regulatory regions of oncogenes such as MYC, thereby controlling its expression and that of the downstream transcriptome. Following the identification of the first selective inhibitors, BET proteins have been shown to play essential roles in hematological and, more recently, in solid tumors. Here we studied the efficacy of the novel BET inhibitor BAY 1238097 in melanoma models.BAY 1238097 was a potent BET inhibitor with IC50 values of 47 and 295 nM for BRD4 BD1 and BD2, respectively. In NanoBRET assays, the interaction between BRD4, BRD3 or BRD2 with histone H4 was blocked in intact cells with IC50 values of 65 nM, 294 nM and 642 nM, respectively. In addition to its strong anti-proliferative activity in several hematological tumor models, BAY 1238097 was also effective in several melanoma cell lines with GI50 values below 500 nM in BRAF wild-type (CHL-1, COLO-792, B16F10, IPC-298, MeWo) as well as BRAF mutant (A375, G-361, SK-MEL-30, LOX-IMVI, SK-MEL-5, MEL-HO) models. Resistant cell lines with GI50 values above 10 M were identified in both the BRAF wild-type and mutant groups. ChIP analysis performed in BRAF wild-type CHL-1 cells showed that BAY 1238097 displaced BRD4 from regulatory regions of oncogenes such as MYC, leading to loss of expression. The oxygen consumption rates of the melanoma cell lines were measured and we found that cell lines sensitive to BAY 1238097 depended on oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis for energy production.In vivo efficacy was determined for BAY 1238097 in three patient-derived melanoma models harboring the wild-type BRAF gene. Daily, oral treatment with 7.5 mg/kg BAY 1238097 led to significantly reduced tumor growth (39% T/C) in one model. Interestingly, this model was resistant to dacarbazine given i.p. at 100 mg/kg daily. No biologically significant anti-tumor activity was observed for the two other models treated with the same conditions (62% and 70% T/C, respectively).Altogether the results show BAY 1238097 to be a potent inhibitor of BRD4 binding to histones. The compound has strong anti-proliferative activity in different melanoma models, regardless of the BRAF mutation status but related to the metabolic activity. One out of three patient-derived melanoma models with wild-type BRAF responded to BAY 1238097 treatment in vivo.

        "Background":"['Inherent and acquired resistance of melanomas carrying active mutations in BRAF to mutant BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) remains a major obstacle for curative treatment of the disease. Since both BRAFi and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) kill sensitive melanoma cells by activating the BH3-only protein Bim, we examined whether they cooperate in killing of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells. We show here that co-treatment with the HDACi SAHA and the BRAFi PLX4720 synergistically kills BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells in vitro, and that the combination of SAHA and the clinically available BRAFi vemurafenib cooperatively inhibits melanoma growth in vivo. Although SAHA plus PLX4720 activated the caspase cascade, the latter did not appear to be indispensable for induction of cell death. Likewise, PLX4720 alone kills sensitive melanoma cells in a caspase-independent manner. Similar to caspases, Bim seemed dispensable for synergistic killing by SAHA and PLX4720. The mechanism by which co-treatment with HDACi and BRAFi kills BRAFV600E melanoma cells remains to be elucidated, but we have found that this is not mediated by receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), which is essential for induction of programmed necrosis. Regardless, our results suggest that combinations of HDACi and BRAFi may have therapeutic advantages, in that the conventional caspase-dependent, mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic machinery is often suppressed in melanoma cells.']",

Therefore, activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and phosphoproteomics was carried out to decipher steady state differences in global signaling mechanisms in nave and BRAFi resistant melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutations.Four cell lines (A375, 1205Lu, WM164 and WM793) were selected to evaluate different molecular backgrounds of BRAF mutation based on their PTEN status (either WT or null). For each cell type, both the nave and BRAFi resistant lines were analyzed via ABPP as well as chemical labeling with tandem mass tags (TMT) prior to discovery phosphoproteomics. While the ABPP approach mined for kinases, phosphoproteomics identified STY phosphorylated peptides providing information on signaling via kinase substrates. LC-MS/MS discovery proteomics (RSLC and Q Exactive, Thermo) identified and relatively quantified all peptides observed in ABPP and TMT phosphoproteomics experiments. MaxQuant was used for data evaluation; preliminary statistical analyses were performed in Perseus to select significant differences for pathway mapping (GeneGO, Metacore) and follow up experiments using siRNA or pharmacological inhibition. Adaptive responses to combination treatment were also explored using the SysQuant workflow for quantitative expression analysis and phosphoproteomics. These experiments served as a basis for comparison for a pilot project of 12 metastatic tumors from BRAF mutant melanoma patients selected for comparison of good and poor survival outcomes.ABPP measurements on different cell line models (A375, 1205Lu, WM793 and WM164) reveal significant differences in ATP uptake of proteins in the resistant cell line model compared to its nave counterpart. For example, in the 1205Lu cell line several proteins including EGFR, p38alpha, DNA-PK formed an interconnected pathway. Overall we identified between 2,000-2,800 proteins in each cell line with 150 kinases. Isobaric labeling coupled to phosphoproteomics identified 1,600 quantifiable proteins with 4,000 phosphorylation sites. Phosphoproteomics revealed concomitant increase in phosphorylation levels of the substrates acted upon by kinases showing higher ATP uptake in ABPP measurements. For example, in 1205Lu BRAFi resistant cells, CDK1, CDK2 and DNA-PK showed higher ATP uptake and their substrates SSK1, DPYSL3, and vimentin showed higher phosphorylation levels.The complementary nature of the two functional proteomics approaches provided holistic overview of signalling network in melanoma and enabled selection of targets for follow-up studies.']",

        "Background":"['BRAF(V600E) is the most common oncogenic mutation in melanoma and leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, which results in uncontrolled cell growth. Selective BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib have been observed to neutralize oncogenic the signaling, inhibit cellular growth, and improve patient outcome. Although these mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance have been reported, few studies focused on how to overcome the resistance. Propranolol, a non-selective β-blocker, was confirmed to involve in multiple anticancer effects. Our previous study also showed propranolol inhibited melanoma by suppressing MAPK and AKT pathways in vitro an in vivo. But its efficacy and mechanism of overcoming vemurafenib still remain unknown in melanoma. Here, we explored the effect of propranolol on the A375, P-8 (patient-derived melanoma cell line) vemurafenib resistance cell line and resistance mice xenografts. Cell viability assay demonstrated that 2μM -20μM vemurafenib couldn’t decrease the proliferation but 24h-120h of incubation of 2μM-200μM propranolol inhibited viability with a concentration and time dependent manner in the two resistance cell line. TUNEL staining showed 24h incubation of 20μM propranolol alone or plus 4μM vemurafeinb obviously increased cell apoptosis. Mice received daily ig. administration of propranolol at the dose of 2 mg/kg alone or plus 10 mg/kg for 21days. The mean tumor volume at day 21 in resistance A375 xenografts was 221.13 ± 7.65mm3vs. 904.12 ± 70.57mm3 vs. 2021 ± 316.24mm3for the propranolol plus vemurafenib, propranolol alone, vemurafenib alone, respectively. Propranolol improved mice survival, 28.6% animal dead in plus group, 57.1% mice dead in the propranolol group, and 71.5% animal dead in vemurafenib at end of treatment. IHC showed propranolol also reduced Ki67 index both in propranolol and plus group when compared with vemurafenib treated mice. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was performed to explore the mechanism of propranolol overcoming the resistance, the data showed propranolol largely reduced mRNA levels of IGF family (IGFBP3, IGFLR1, IGFBP6, IGF2, IGF1R.etc.) but elevated the expressions of innate immune related genes (NKG7, TLR9, NCR3.etc.) in A375-vemr cell line. These results provide a strategy of therapeutic resistance for the clinic, importantly, this study also provide a clue targeting IGF family and regulating innate immune might be a potential strategy to suppress resistance in BRAF inhibitor therapies in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND.- Cancer cells from solid tumors become metabolically stressed, when nutrients are insufficient within poorly vascularized regions. Metabolic stress results from severe deprivation of oxygen, glutamine and glucose, partly through excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Mutant BRAF can stimulate the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1) in physiological glucose and supplementation with supra-physiological glutamine in melanoma cells (Kumar SM et al, Cancer Res. 2007;67', '3177-84).Although HIF1 reprograms melanomas to become highly glycolytic, this can be impaired in a microenvironment with sub-physiological levels of glutamine and glucose (Kwon SJ, Lee YJ.Clin Cancer Res. 2005;11', '4694-700).,because melanomas require glycolysis and mitochondrial glutamine utilization. PURPOSE.- To compare proliferation and survival in response to glutamine and glucose restriction in wt-BRAF or mutant BRAF melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL. Determination of metabolic activity/proliferation and cell survival by fluorometric assays and crystal violet staining. RESULTS.- Glutamine depletion diminished survival even in physiological 5 mM glucose, particularly during hypoxia. However, 2.5 mM glucose or exogenous pyruvate when added together with another anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) partly substituted for glutamine in normoxic wt-BRAF cells. A much lower attenuation was seen in glutamine-depleted mutant BRAF cells when supplemented with NAC and pyruvate, particularly, under hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS.-1) glutamine restriction decreases metabolic activity and tumor cell survival, irrespective of BRAF status, being more toxic to mut-BRAF cells, either under hypoxia or in physiological glucose and normoxia,. 2) Antagonizing glutamine addiction may decrease tumor recurrence if combined with anti-BRAF targeted therapy.']",

        "Background":"['The clinical development and potent efficacy of selective RAF and MEK inhibitors has transformed the treatment of the 50% of melanoma patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations. However, a substantial percentage of these patients fail to respond to therapy, and all who respond eventually develop resistance. We found that suppression of TORC1 activity, as measured by decreases in ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation (P-S6) in response to RAF or MEK inhibitors, was a highly effective predictor of sensitivity in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro and in mouse xenografts. TORC1 and P-S6 were suppressed in response to RAF or MEK inhibitors in sensitive but not resistant melanoma cells, despite robust suppression of the MAPK pathway by these inhibitors. Notably, suppression of P-S6 levels, as assessed by immunohistochemistry in paired biopsies obtained from BRAF mutant melanoma patients before and during treatment, was associated with significantly improved progression-free survival. Finally, we show that changes in P-S6 levels specifically in tumor cells can be readily monitored by multiplexed, quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of fine needle aspiration biopsies obtained from patients before and during the first two weeks of BRAF inhibitor therapy. This provides a minimally invasive means for monitoring the efficacy of treatment in real time, before changes in tumor volume are apparent on traditional radiographs. Together, these results establish changes in P-S6 levels with therapy as a robust biomarker to guide the treatment of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma, and present a powerful methodology for monitoring changes in potentially any signaling pathway in response to therapy in patients.']",

However, the primary tumor is often no longer available and metastases not always reflect the characteristics of the primary tumor. In melanoma it is not clear at what stage epithelial antigen is expressed. CETCs are present in peripheral blood in a significant proportion of patients with malignant melanoma. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether these cells belong to melanoma clone due to the presence of the BRAF gene mutation in these cells. For this reason, the analysis of multiple isolated CETCs from individual patients for BRAF gene mutations was performed.  Methods', ' Blood from patients with malignant melanoma was analyzed for cells positive for the EpCAM and Melan-A using the maintrac approach, avoiding cell selection and using an image analysis system for detection. Subsequently, between 8-20 EpCAM and Melan-A positive cells from each patient were isolated individually using a semi-automated capillary approach and deposited one by one into micro cups. The DNA of individual cells was amplified by whole genome amplification and assayed using the cobas BRAF V600 mutation test. Furthermore, we performed mutation analysis of cells after magnetic bead enrichment which is known to contain a mixture of CETCs and leukocytes.  Results', ' DNA could be amplified from all individually isolated cells. In addition, we analyzed the presence of V600 mutation after magnetic bead enrichment. A BRAF mutation was detected in 20 - 75 % of evaluable cells in patients with BRAF mutation in primary tumor. In advanced stage or metastatic patients under Vemurafenib therapy, we were not able to find mutated CETCs.  Conclusions', ' Individually isolated CETCs from the peripheral blood from patients with melanoma allow not only to detect mutations but also to determine the frequency of mutated cells.

Under such stress conditions, eIF2 kinases, including PERK, GCN2, PKR and HRI, phosphorylate eIF2, resulting in reduction of general protein synthesis while facilitating selective translation of ATF4, a central transcription factor that upregulates expression of stress-induced genes for cellular adaptation. Recently, it was reported that BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib triggers activation of the eIF2-ATF4 signaling in BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines; however, activation mechanisms of vemurafenib-induced ISR signaling not fully understood.In this study, we first compared vemurafenib-induced ISR activation in BRAF-mutant and -wild type melanoma cell lines. Consistent with previous studies, vemurafenib activated ISR signaling preferentially in BRAF-mutant cell lines, as determined by phosphorylation of eIF2 and ATF4 expression. We also found that the ISR activation by vemurafenib was impaired by knockdown of BRAF in BRAF-mutant cell lines. These results indicated that existence of mutated BRAF is important for vemurafenib to trigger activation of ISR signaling pathway. We next examined which eIF2 kinase is involved in the ISR signaling activation by vemurafenib. We found that knockdown of GCN2, an eIF2 kinase sensing depletion of amino acids, impaired phosphorylation of eIF2 and ATF4 induction by vemurafenib. In addition, we confirmed that vemurafenib induced phosphorylation of GCN2 on Thr899 that is known to occur in response to amino acids starvation. In agreement with these results, gene expression profiling with ontology analysis revealed that vemurafenib upregulated genes that are involved in amino acids biosynthesis via ISR signaling. Collectively, our results suggested that vemurafenib activated ISR signaling pathway possibly through mimicking amino acid deprivation in BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines.']",

        "Background":"['Phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells can reason diversity in therapy responses within the same tumor, which might influence the overall efficacy of the treatment. Tumor stroma is an important contributor to intratumoral heterogeneity and can play a significant modulatory role in therapy response/resistance. Through studies on biological mechanisms of stroma-promoted resistance, novel targets could be identified for combination therapies aimed to eradicate both stroma-dependent and independent counterparts of the tumor.In this study we explore how the efficacy of the BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) vemurafenib, a targeted agent commonly used against BRAF-mutant malignant melanoma, is modulated by stromal cells. By using multiple co-culture systems and experimental metastasis models, we showed that in the presence of lung fibroblasts, adjacent melanoma cells respond poorly to BRAFi. The protective influence of stroma was associated with stroma-induced changes in the melanoma cell phenotype, which was mapped by global gene expression and proteome analysis. We revealed that under the influence of fibroblasts, melanoma cells underwent a phenotype transition to the invasive, mesenchymal-like state characterized by down-regulation of melanocytic markers (MITF and its targets), up-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)/RTK-linked signaling (like AXL or PDGFR activating down-stream PI3K) and elevation of extracellular-matrix fibronectin. We propose that these alterations allow melanoma cells to utilize alternative signaling pathways, like RTK-PI3K-mTOR instead of BRAF-driven MAPK, which reduces sensitivity to BRAFi. This scenario is further supported by the observations that', ' i) upon BRAFi treatment, stroma-protected melanoma maintained high levels of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), a mTOR effector protein; ii) inhibition of mTOR or the upstream pathway PI3K together with BRAF eradicated pS6high subpopulations and enhanced the anti-proliferative effect in stroma-interacting melanoma; iii) the benefit of mTOR and BRAF co-inhibition was also seen in early-stage lung metastases in vivo.In conclusion, our findings signify the importance of stromal cells, specifically lung fibroblasts, in regulating melanoma cell phenotype and signaling, which impairs response to BRAFi. The stroma-induced invasive phenotype determinants that facilitate RTK-PI3K-mTOR signaling (e.g. AXL, PDGFR or fibronectin-binding integrins) could represent potential targets for overcoming stroma-mediated resistance to BRAFi. Currently, we are testing BRAFi in combination with several novel inhibitors of the identified RTKs and performing a cancer drug sensitivity screen to reveal the most effective drug combinations against stroma-interacting melanoma cells.']",

Phase I/II data published recently for a combination of DAB and TRA suggest improved efficacy compared with single-agent therapy; nevertheless, the short duration of responses even for the combination points to an urgent need for further improvement.BI 882370, a potent and selective B/CRAF inhibitor, binds to the DFG-out (inactive) conformation of BRAF, whereas VEM as well as DAB occupy the DFG-in (active) conformation. BI 882370 inhibited proliferation of BRAFmut melanoma cell lines with about 100x higher potency (EC50 1 - 10 nM) than VEM; BRAFwt cell lines were not affected at 1 M.For studies in nude mouse xenograft models, VEM and DAB were dosed to provide exposures achieved in patients; TRA was used at the MTD for mice, resulting in exposures at or above the exposures tolerated by humans. In the G361 melanoma model (BRAFV600E), 1st line treatment with 25 mg/kg BI 882370 administered twice daily (bid) resulted in partial regression of all tumors, superior to results achieved by VEM, DAB as well as their combination.To model clinical resistance, a large cohort of A375 melanoma (BRAFV600E) bearing mice was treated with VEM; without exception, all tumors responded with partial regression and their median volume reached a nadir on day 11.

BI 882370 induced tumor regression, however, resistance developed within 3 weeks. BI 882370 in combination with TRA resulted in more pronounced regressions and resistance was not observed until the end of the experiment, 6 weeks after initiation of 2nd line therapy.Importantly, in multiple in vivo studies performed to date, mice treated with BI 882370 at doses of 25 mg/kg bid for several weeks did not show any body weight loss or clinical signs of intolerability.

Further, a pilot study in male rats dosed at 25 mg/kg bid for 2 weeks did not result in any toxicologically relevant findings in terms of clinical chemistry, hematology, pathology and toxicogenomics of liver and skin.Our results suggest that compared to 1st generation BRAF inhibitors, BI 882370 may provide an improved therapeutic window, enabling more pronounced and longer-lasting pathway suppression and thus resulting in improved efficacy.']",

Tumor location principally involved the foot 10/12 (83%); mean Breslow thickness was 4.04 mm (range 2.20-7.75), Clark IV or higher 11/12 (92%), ulceration 8/12 (67%), regression 12/12 (100%), and mean mitoses per mm squared was 5.71 (range 0-30). Conclusions', ' Non-Caucasian patients with ALM were found to have a high prevalence of the triple negative genotype. Those within that group appeared to have thicker tumors. Nearly half of our cohort had thick primary lesions with a high propensity for ulceration. This is the first study to our knowledge that has profiled somatic mutations (c-KIT, BRAF, NRAS) in a multi-ethnic population of ALM patients and examined the histologic correlates of a triple negative genotype. This novel concept highlights the relevance of alternate pathways and molecular targets, such as PI3KCA in prognosis and therapy.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has been proven to be efficacious for the treatment of melanomas harboring (V600E) mutation. While the response rate is high, resistance is inevitable. The response to salvage therapy is poor. While the MEK inhibitor may be able to enhance anti-tumor efficacy of vemurafenib, but patients eventually relapse. Hence, there is an urgent need for second line treatment for melanoma patients who fail vemurafenib treatment.In this study, we discovered that BRAF inhibitor-resistant (BR) melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to arginine deprivation. Arginine deprivation was achieved using arginine degrading enzyme (pegylated arginine deiminase, ADI-PEG20, kindly provided by Polaris). ADI-PEG20 has been shown to induce autophagy in primary melanoma culture derived from patients whose tumors do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). Apoptosis does occur when these cells are exposed longer (5-7 days) and at higher doses. Inducible ASS expression upon arginine deprivation also impedes the antitumor effect of ADI-PEG20. We have found that BR cells from MEL-1220 (derived from patient with V600E and ASS (-)), A375, and A2058 cells (inducible ASS) cultured in the presence of vemurafenib at IC50 over 20 weeks had non-inducible ASS expression. MTT and Annexin V/PI analyses showed that ADI-PEG20 induced 3-6 fold increase in apoptosis and growth inhibition in BR cells compared to parental cells following 3-day incubation. These results were further confirmed by increased active (cleaved) form of caspase-3 as detected by western blotting after the addition of ADI-PEG20. The mouse xenograft model also verified that ADI-PEG20 abolished tumor growth of A2058BR cells while only retardation of growth seen in A2058 cells (the reduction rate of tumor volume is 92% vs. 63%). We found that two vital autophagic proteins (Beclin1 and ATG5) decreased in resistant cells after treatment with ADI-PEG20, which might explain the inability to undergo autophagy upon arginine deprivation as a survival mechanism and re-directing the cells toward apoptosis. The other mechanism leading to non-inducible ASS expression is c-Myc degradation. It has been proven that c-myc is a positive regulator in ASS transcription, and c-Myc stability is governed by ubiquitination. By immunoprecipitation assay, we found that BR cells had lower levels of deubiquitinating enzyme USP28, and hence cannot prevent c-Myc from ubiquitin-dependent prosteasomal degradation. Therefore, our results demonstrated that BRAF inhibitor resistance suppresses c-Myc-mediated ASS transcription and in turn increases sensitivity to ADI-PEG20.In conclusion, ADI-PEG20 appears to be a good candidate for targeted therapy for melanoma patients who have tumor recurrence or disease progression after vemurafenib treatment.

Methods', '  We analyzed plasma samples from 45 patients with stage IV melanoma prospectively enrolled in the NYU Melanoma Biorepository program.

        "Background":"['In cutaneous melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, BRAF is mutated in 45% of cases and NRAS in a further 20% of cases. The lack of known drivers in the remaining proportion of samples represents a challenge for personalized medicine. We hypothesize that the BRAF/NRAS double wild-type (WT) samples are a heterogeneous group driven by multiple events that arise independently. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and complimentary RNA-seq of 23 tumor tissue samples from 21 patients. Six of these tumors were WT for BRAF and NRAS, so we studied these cases further. The SNV load in the WT samples is more variable than the BRAF or NRAS driven melanomas.

We identified the somatic mutations that are specifically enriched for double wild-type samples and observed that the top two hits, NF1 (30.2% in double WT vs. 5.7% otherwise) and KIT (15.8% in double WT vs. 0.8% otherwise) are known driver gene candidates for wild-type melanomas, but we also find other novel candidate driver genes. Thus, we present a framework for identification of driver mutations and therapeutic targets in double wild-type melanomas and integration of these types of data with other large datasets such as those derived from RNA-seq and RPPA will assist in the development of approaches to stratify double wild-type patients for targeted or immune-therapies.']",
