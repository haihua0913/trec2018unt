The aim of this study was to determine whether celecoxib, a selective Cox-2 inhibitor, protected against HER-2/neu-induced experimental breast cancer. Cox-2 protein was detected in breast carcinomas from mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)/neu mice. Treatment with celecoxib (500 ppm) significantly reduced the incidence of mammary tumors in MMTV/neu mice (P = 0.003) and caused about a 50% reduction in mammary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. Because mammary glands from MMTV/neu mice expressed all four PGE2 receptor subtypes, we speculate that signaling through PGE2 receptors is important for mammary tumorigenesis. These results strengthen the rationale for developing clinical trials to determine whether selective Cox-2 inhibitors possess anticancer properties in humans at risk for breast cancer.",

Immunohistochemical analysis for Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor and Her-2/neu was done in all the cases. Fluorescent in situ hybridization for Her-2/neu gene amplification was performed in all 2+ cases and few equivocal 1+ and 3+cases by immunohistochemistry. Correlation between Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor and Her-2/ neu amplification and grade of tumor was calculated.;The expression of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor were significantly correlated (p < 0.001). Also, there was a significant negative correlation between expression of hormone receptor and Her-2/neu amplification. The histologic grade of the tumor was significantly correlated to the expression of both Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor. However, the relationship between Her-2/ neu amplification and grade was not significant and many of the grade III tumor were Her-2/neu negative. In addition, Her-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization was observed in 84.6% of breast cancer that were 3+ and in 18.75 % cases that were 2+ by immunohistochemistry.;Prevalence of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor expression and Her-2/neu amplification in breast cancer in the Saudi Arabian population is similar to that reported internationally.

Preexisting cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity to HER-2/ neu has so far been mainly evaluated in terms of detection of CTL precursor (CTLp) frequencies to the immunogenic HLA-A2-binding nona-peptide 369-377 (HER-2(9(369))). In the present study, we examined patients with HER-2/ neu(+) breast, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers for preexisting CTL immunity to four recently described HER-2/ neu-derived and HLA-A2-restricted \"cytotoxic\" peptides and to a novel one spanning amino acids 777-785 also with HLA-A2-binding motif. We utilized enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay, which allows a quantitative and functional assessment of T cells directed against specific peptides after only brief in vitro incubation. CTL reactivity was determined with an interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISpot assay detecting T cells at the single cell level secreting IFN-gamma. CTLp were defined as peptide-specific precursors per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Patients' PBMCs with increased CTLp were also tested against autologous tumor targets and peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) in cytotoxicity assays. We also studied patients with HER-2/ neu-negative ((-)) tumors and healthy individuals. Of the HER-2/neu(+) patients examined, 31% had increased CTLp to HER-2(9(952)), 19% to HER-2(9(665)), 16% to HER-2(9(689)), and 12.5% HER-2(9(435)), whereas only 2 of 32 patients (6%) responded to HER-2(9(777)). The CTLp recognizing HER-2(9(952)) were extremely high in two patients with breast cancer, one with lung cancer, and one with prostate cancer. None of the HER-2/neu(-) patients or healthy donors exhibited increased CTLp to any of these peptides. Besides IFN-gamma production, preexisting CTL immunity to all five HER-2/ neu peptides was also shown in cytotoxicity assays where patients' PBMCs with increased CTLp specifically lysed autologous tumor targets and autologous peptide-pulsed DCs. Our results demonstrate for the first time that (1) preexisting immunity to peptides HER-2(9(435)), HER-2(9(952)), HER-2(9(689)), HER-2(9(665)), and HER-2(9(777)) is present in patients with HER-2/ neu(+) tumors of distinct histology, (2) HER-2(9(777)) is a naturally processed peptide expressed on the surface of HER-2/ neu(+) tumors, as are the other four peptides, and (3) HER-2/ neu(+) prostate tumor cells can be recognized and lysed by autologous HER-2 peptide-specific CTL.

However, de novo and acquired antibody resistance is one of the major limitations of trastuzumab therapy warranting the search for other therapeutic strategies. One of the most remarkable features of adenovirus (AdV)-based vaccine is its ability to induce exceptionally high and sustained frequencies of transgene product-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. In this study, we constructed two recombinant AdVs (AdV(OVA) and AdV(HER-2)) expressing ovalbumin (OVA) and HER-2/neu, and assessed AdV-induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses and preventive/therapeutic antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that AdV(OVA) stimulates efficient OVA-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer responses, leading to preventive long-term immunity against OVA-expressing BL6-10ova melanoma in wild-type C56BL/6 mice. We further demonstrate that AdV(HER-2) stimulates HER-2/neu-specific CD8(+) CTL responses, leading to a significant reduction in breast carcinogenesis in transgenic FVBneuN mice (P<0.05), but has little therapeutic effect on pre-existing Tg1-1 tumor even at early stage (15 mm(3)). In contrast, the anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy is capable of completely inhibiting Tg1-1 tumor growth at early stage, but fails to eradicate well-established Tg1-1 breast tumor (100 mm(3)). Interestingly, a combinatorial immunotherapy of anti-HER-2/neu antibody with AdV(HER-2) vaccine was capable of curing 4 of 10 studied mice bearing well-established Tg1-1 breast tumors and significantly delaying in death of the remaining six tumor-bearing mice (P<0.05). Taken together, our results suggest an adjuvant effect of AdV(HER-2) on anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy for well-established breast tumor in transgenic FVBneuN mice, and this combinatorial immunotherapy of trastuzumab with AdV(HER-2) vaccine may be used as a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of advanced HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer.",

Results of clinical trials with Herceptin suggest that it may prolong the survival of patients with advanced metastatic breast carcinoma. Relatively little is known concerning the relationship between HER-2 /neu status and ovarian clear cell carcinoma. If HER-2 /neu overexpression status were demonstrable in ovarian clear cell carcinoma and a clinical correlation between overexpression and prognosis could be established, a rationale for clinical use of Herceptin for this tumor could be established. Our aim was to evaluate HER-2 /neu status in ovarian clear cell carcinomas. Fifteen ovarian clear cell carcinoma cases were immunostained for HER-2 /neu using HercepTest (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Overexpression of HER-2 /neu was detected in only one case. Unlike in breast carcinoma, HER-2 /neu overexpression appeared to be uncommon in ovarian clear cell carcinomas.

In previous work, we showed that the adenovirus type 5 E1A can repress HER-2/neu expression at the transcriptional level. Here we first demonstrated that paclitaxel sensitivity correlates with HER-2/neu expression level in a panel of mouse fibroblasts expressing different levels of HER-2/ neu, and that downregulation of HER-2/neu expression by E1A sensitizes the cells to paclitaxel. To further test whether E1A can sensitize HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer cells to paclitaxel through E1A-mediated HER-2/neu repression, an adenoviral vector was used to transfer the E1A gene into two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361, that overexpress HER-2/neu. After E1A delivery, we observed that HER-2/neu expression level was reduced, and cells were treated with paclitaxel. Cell proliferation assays showed a synergistic growth inhibition effect of E1A and paclitaxel. The synergistic effect was also confirmed by soft agar colony-formation assay. Breast cancer cell lines that express low levels of HER-2/neu, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells showed no synergistic growth inhibition effect when treated on the same protocols. Thus, we concluded that the adenovirus type 5 E1A gene can sensitize paclitaxel-resistant HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells to the drug by repressing HER-2/neu expression. This in turn may have important implications for the development of a novel therapy that combines chemotherapy and gene therapy.",

It is well known that ErbB2 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) plays an important part in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ErbB2 action needs to be well studied. In this report, we discovered that the decreased expression levels of miR-34a were inversely correlated with the increased ErbB2 levels in breast cancer. A luciferase reporter assay was done to understand the potential correlation between ErbB2 and miR-34a. Over-expression of miR-34a reduces ErbB2 expression and suppresses breast cancer cell invasion and growth in vitro. What's more, reduced expression of ErbB2 inhibits breast Cancer cell proliferation and re-expression of ErbB2 reversed miR-34a-dependent tumor suppression. Meanwhile, miR-34a levels were correlated inversely with breast cancer malignancy. Our study demonstrates that miR-34a, like ErbB2, might be a diagnostic target in breast cancer.",

Therefore, the analysis of HER-2 in patients with breast cancer has become an important and routine test to select those who may benefit from the gene-based targeted therapy trastuzumab (herceptin). There is good correlation between HER-2/neu protein overexpression and HER-2 gene amplification in breast cancer. However, inconsistent results have been reported in the rate of HER-2/neu protein overexpression in other malignant neoplasms. Furthermore, only rare studies have investigated the correlation between the HER-2/neu protein overexpression and the status of HER-2 gene in these tumors. We investigated the HER-2 gene and protein status in several cases of Paget disease of the nipple and vulva by using a chromogenic in situ hybridization assay and immunohistochemistry. We find that the majority of the Paget disease of the breast demonstrate HER-2 gene amplification, whereas most of the extramammary Paget disease lack HER-2 gene amplification. In addition, our results show a good correlation between HER-2/neu protein overexpression and HER-2 gene amplification in Paget disease of the nipple, but we were unable to confirm this correlation in HER-2/neu protein overexpressing Paget disease of the vulva.",

To better understand the molecular events associated with overexpression of this gene in human breast cancer cells, differential hybridization was used to identify genes whose expression levels are altered in cells overexpressing this receptor. Of 16 000 clones screened from an overexpression cell cDNA library, a total of 19 non-redundant clones were isolated including seven whose expression decreases (C clones) and 12 which increase (H clones) in association with HER-2/ neu overexpression. Of these, five C clones and 11 H clones have been confirmed to be differentially expressed by northern blot analysis. This group includes nine genes of known function, three previously sequenced genes of relatively uncharacterized function and four novel genes without a match in GenBank. Examination of the previously characterized genes indicates that they represent sequences known to be frequently associated with the malignant phenotype, suggesting that the subtraction cloning strategy used identified appropriate target genes. In addition, differential expression of 12 of 16 (75%) cDNAs identified in the breast cancer cell lines are also seen in HER-2/ neu -overexpressing ovarian cancer cells, indicating that they represent generic associations with HER-2/ neu overexpression. Finally, up-regulation of two of the identified cDNAs, one novel and one identified but as yet uncharacterized gene, was confirmed in human breast cancer specimens in association with HER-2/ neu overexpression. Further characterization of these genes may yield insight into the fundamental biology and pathogenetic effects of HER-2/ neu overexpression in human breast and ovarian cancer cells.",

We observed that the ERBB2 gene resides within a locus of high linkage disequilibrium, composed of three major ancestral haplotypes in the study population. These haplotypes are marked by simple tandem repeat and single nucleotide polymorphisms, including the missense variants I655V and P1170A. We observed a risk-modifying effect of a highly polymorphic simple tandem repeat within an evolutionarily conserved region, 4.4 kb upstream from the ERBB2 transcription start site. Under a dominant genetic model, the age-adjusted odds ratio was 1.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.37). Its association with breast cancer, and with breast cancer stratified by histology, by histologic grade, and by stage, remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons.

We investigated the relationship between HER2 and the transcription factor FoxM1 in breast cancer. HER2 and FoxM1 expression levels were compared in breast carcinoma cell lines, paraffin-embedded breast cancer patient samples and at the mRNA level in purified breast epithelial cells. To further examine the relationship between HER2 and FoxM1 expression, we either overexpressed or siRNA-mediated depleted endogenous HER2 in breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, a mammary epithelium-targeted HER2 (neu) transgenic mouse model was also used to assess the effect of HER2 on FoxM1 levels. Furthermore, the effect of the HER2-tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib on FoxM1 in HER2 positive breast cancer cells was investigated. HER2 protein levels directly correlated with FoxM1 expression in both breast carcinoma cell lines and paraffin-embedded breast cancer patient samples. Moreover, in purified breast epithelial cells, overexpression of HER2 was associated with high levels of FoxM1 mRNA, suggesting that the upregulation of FoxM1 expression is at least partially mediated transcriptionally. Furthermore, overexpression or ablation of endogenous HER2 resulted in parallel changes in FoxM1 expression. Critically, mammary epithelium-targeted HER2 mouse tumours also resulted in increased FoxM1 expression, suggesting that HER2 directed FoxM1 expression occurs in vivo and may be a critical downstream effector of HER2-targeting therapies. Indeed, treatment of breast cancer cells with lapatinib reduced FoxM1 expression at protein, mRNA and gene promoter levels. Moreover, analysis of normal and breast cancer patient samples revealed that elevated FoxM1 expression at protein and mRNA levels correlated with breast cancer development, but not significantly with cancer progression and survival. Our results indicate that the HER2 receptor regulates the expression of the FoxM1 transcription factor, which has a role in breast cancer development.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an HLA-DR4 healthy donor were used to induce HER-2/neu peptide-specific CD4(+) T cell clones by in vitro immunization with HER-2/neu peptide (884-899)-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs). Strong proliferation and significant levels of IFN-gamma were induced by the CD4(+) T cell clones in response to specific stimulation with autologous DCs loaded with HER-2(884-899). Furthermore, these clones also recognized HER-2/neu(+) tumor cell lines, and tumor cells from breast, colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas induced to express HLA-DR4, but also the HLA-DR4(+) melanoma cell line FM3 transfected to express HER-2/neu. The recognition of tumor cells was strongly inhibited by an anti-HLA-DR mAb.

On the basis of the results of steroid receptors expression, 38 (69%) cases were classified as pure apocrine carcinoma (androgen receptor positive/ER negative/PR negative), whereas 17 (31%) were re-classified as apocrine-like carcinomas because they did not have the characteristic steroid receptor expression profile. Her-2/neu overexpression was observed in 54% of the cases (57% pure apocrine carcinomas vs 47% apocrine-like carcinomas).

The prognostic significance, however, remains somewhat controversial, partly because of discrepancies among different methodologies used for detection of the oncogene amplification or overexpression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has recently been shown to be a useful technique for analyzing genetic alterations in interphase nuclei in various tumors. In this study, FISH was used to quantitate HER-2/ neu and c-myc gene amplification in touch preparations of frozen tissue from 100 node-negative breast carcinomas. HER-2/neu amplification was found to be associated with an abnormal DNA index (P < .001) and tumor size (P < .04). Amplification of c-myc was associated with S phase (P < .0003), abnormal DNA index (P < .003), and a negative estrogen receptor status (P < .01). The coamplification of both oncogenes was strongly associated with an abnormal DNA index (P < .0001) and with tumor size (P < .009). The use of FISH for detection of HER-2/neu gene amplification was 92% concordant with immunocytochemistry (ICC) used for detection of overexpression of HER-2/neu protein. Fifteen of the 100 cases were both amplified for HER-2/neu by FISH and positive by ICC analysis. Seven cases without HER-2/neu gene amplification demonstrated HER-2/neu protein overexpression by ICC. One HER-2/neu-amplified case was negative by ICC. Repeat analysis of a subset of cases showed FISH to be a more reproducible method than ICC in the analysis of HER-2/neu in touch preparations of breast carcinoma. FISH is a rapid and reproducible method that allows the accurate measurement of the level of oncogene amplification within interphase nuclei. The use of FISH should provide a more accurate assessment of the prognostic significance of oncogene amplification in breast carcinoma.",

At the same time, we compared the ability of serum HER-2/neu, CA15.3, CA12-5, CA19-9, carcino embryonic antigen (CEA), and alpha-feto-protein (AFP) in breast, colorectal, and lung cancer patients. Forty, thirty-six, and twenty-three patients with lung, colon and breast cancer were included in this study, respectively. Serum levels of HER-2/neu, CA15.3, CA12-5, CA19-9, CEA, and AFP were measured. Her-2 neu levels were significantly higher in the breast cancer groups than colorectal and lung cancer and controls groups (P < 0.01). There is no significant difference when compared with others groups (P > 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the HER-2/neu and CA15-3 values in breast cancer groups. We found 0.75(0.59-0.90) for Her-2/neu from the area under the curve (AUC). P-value for breast cancer is 0.003, and we discovered that 9 ng/ml was the best inersection point. In this situation, we calculated that sensitivity was 65.2%, specificity was 100%, positive predictive value was 100%, negative predictive value 75.8%, and accuracy was 83.4%. These findings indicate that serum HER2/neu levels are clinically valuable in monitoring metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients. Prognosis of breast cancer provides an additional value over the commonly used CA15-3 test. Measurements of levels of serum HER-2/neu provide prognostic and predictive information to the clinician and can especially be used for monitoring metastatic breast cancer patients. Further clinical validation is needed to confirm these findings.",

In breast cancer, HER-2/neu is expressed in early disease development in a large percentage of DCIS lesions and its expression is associated with an increased risk of invasion and recurrence. Targeting HER-2 with antibodies such as trastuzumab or pertuzumab has improved survival, but patients with more extensive disease may develop resistance to therapy. Interestingly, response to HER-2 targeted therapies correlates with presence of immune response genes in the breast. Th1 cell production of the cytokines interferon gamma (IFNγ) and TNFα can enhance MHC class I expression, PD-L1 expression, augment apoptosis and tumor senescence, and enhances growth inhibition of many anti-breast cancer agents, including anti-estrogens and HER-2 targeted therapies. Recently, we have identified that a loss of anti-HER-2 CD4 Th1 in peripheral blood occurs during breast tumorigenesis and is dramatically diminished, even in Stage I breast cancers. The loss of anti-HER-2 Th1 response is specific and not readily reversed by standard therapies. In fact, this loss of anti-HER-2 Th1 response in peripheral blood correlates with lack of complete response to neoadjuvant therapy and diminished disease-free survival. This defect can be restored with HER-2 vaccinations in both DCIS and IBC. Correcting the anti-HER-2 Th1 response may have significant impact in improving response to HER-2 targeted therapies. Development of immune monitoring systems for anti-HER-2 Th1 to identify patients at risk for recurrence could be critical to improving outcomes, since the anti-HER-2 Th1 response can be restored by vaccination. Correction of the cellular immune response against HER-2 may prevent recurrence in high-risk patients with DCIS and IBC at risk of developing new or recurrent breast cancer.",

It was recently demonstrated that trastuzumab, an FDA approved humanized monoclonal antibody against Her-2/ neu tyrosine kinase receptor, did not induce endocytosis of the internalization resistant Her-2/ neu receptor. Here we report that accelerated internalization of trastuzumab can be induced by cross-linking the cell membrane bound antibody-receptor complex with an avidin/streptavidin-biotin system. We demonstrated that internalization was achieved both in vitro and in vivo in Her-2/ neu expressing human breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, SK-BR-3 and AU-565) and that repetitive labeling cycles further amplified the loading of cargo molecules within the targeted cells. No trastuzumab binding and internalization was observed in Her-2/ neu negative MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas weak membrane binding and negligible internalization were detected in MCF-7 cells with low expression level of Her-2/ neu receptor. The method was used to noninvasively image Her-2/ neu receptors in isolated cells and in a preclinical breast cancer model with MRI. The controlled internalization of Her-2/ neu receptors can potentially enhance intracellular delivery of drugs and imaging probes, and improve imaging sensitivity and selectivity as well as therapeutic efficacy, through antibody-directed binding and internalization using a pretargeting approach.",

Their lifetime breast cancer risk is 49% by age 60. Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series. We seek to complement the existing small literature with this report of a histopathologic analysis of breast cancers from women with documented LFS. Unstained slides and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from breast cancers from 39 germline TP53 mutation carriers were assembled from investigators in the LFS consortium. Central histology review was performed on 93% of the specimens by a single breast pathologist from a major university hospital. Histology, grade, and hormone receptor status were assessed by immunohistochemistry; HER-2 status was defined by immunohistochemistry and/or FISH. The 43 tumors from 39 women comprise 32 invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). No other histologies were observed. The median age at diagnosis was 32 years (range 22-46). Of the invasive cancers, 84% were positive for ER and/or PR; and 81% were high grade. Sixty three percent of invasive and 73% of in situ carcinomas were positive for Her2/neu (IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). Of the invasive tumors, 53% were positive for both ER and HER2+; other ER/PR/HER2 combinations were observed. The DCIS were positive for ER and HER2 in 27% of the cases. This report of the phenotype of breast cancers from women with LFS nearly doubles the literature on this topic. Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive. These findings suggest that modern treatments may result in improved outcomes for women with LFS-associated breast cancer.",

Recent studies demonstrate that E1A-mediated sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis can occur via multiple pathways; some of which depend on the expression of functional p53 and/or p19ARF proteins, while some are not. In human breast cancer cells with Her-2/neu overexpression, which usually are more resistance to anti-cancer drugs than cells without Her-2/ neu overexpression, may be sensitized through E1A-mediated downregulation of Her-2/neu. Alternatively, E1A can induce sensitization to anticancer drugs in cancer cells or normal diploid fibroblast cells through upregulating the expression of caspase proenzymes, or downregulating the activity of a critical survival factor Akt and/or upregulating the activities of a pro-apoptotic kinase p38 and a protein phosphatase PP2A, etc. This review summarizes these progresses and proposes a plausible feed-forward model for E1A-mediated chemosensitization in human breast cancer cells.",

Risk factor information on these patients and 737 controls was obtained during home interviews. Most breast cancer risk factors showed similar associations with neu-positive and neu-negative tumors, but remarkable differences were found for breast-feeding and age at first full-term pregnancy. In contrast to the slightly protective effect of breast-feeding in the neu-negative group, the risk of neu-positive breast cancer was 4.2-fold increased in women who ever breast-fed. Increasing age at first full-term pregnancy was positively associated with both neu-positive and neu-negative breast cancer, but the association was about 2 times stronger for neu-positive tumors. We conclude that neu oncogene overexpression of the breast tumor seems to be associated with a distinct risk factor pattern.",

Therefore, in this study, we asked (a) whether EIA might sensitize response to paclitaxel in human HER-2/neu-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells, and, if so, what is the mechanism responsible; and (b) whether this enhanced chemosensitivity would translate into a therapeutic effect in an ovarian cancer xenograft model. Consequently, we demonstrated that: (a) adenovirus type 5 E1A could enhance the sensitivity of paclitaxel in paclitaxel-resistant HER-2/neu-overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis, (b) this induction was heavily dependent on activation of the caspase-3 pathway, and (c) nude mice bearing i.p.

It is an attractive target for receptor-directed antitumor therapy using mAbs. Unlike other epidermal growth factor receptor family members, HER-2/neu does not bind a high-affinity ligand, but rather functions as the preferred dimerization partner. Pertuzumab (Omnitarg) is a humanized mAb directed against the HER-2/neu dimerization domain that inhibits receptor signaling. The recent definition of the crystal structure of the HER-2/neu-pertuzumab complex demonstrated that the receptor dimerization region encompassed residues 266-333. Based on the three-dimensional structure of the complex, we have designed three conformational peptide constructs (sequences 266-296, 298-333, and 315-333) to mimic regions of the dimerization loop of the receptor and to characterize their in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy. All the constructs elicited high-affinity peptide Abs that inhibited multiple signaling pathways including HER-2/neu-specific inhibition of cellular proliferation and cytoplasmic receptor domain phosphorylation. All the peptide Abs showed Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to varying degrees with the 266-296 constructs being equally effective as compared with Herceptin. The 266-296 peptide vaccine had statistically reduced tumor onset in both transplantable tumor models (FVB/n and BALB/c) and significant reduction in tumor development in two transgenic mouse tumor models (BALB-neuT and VEGF(+/-)Neu2-5(+/-)). The 266-296 construct represents the most promising candidate for antitumor vaccination and could also be used to treat a variety of cancers with either normal or elevated expression of HER-2 including breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate.",

As HER2 over-expression/amplification is a prerequisite for treatment with trastuzumab, an accurate assessment of HER-2 status is the first step for successful treatment. In metastatic breast cancer, we routinely assess HER2 expression in the primary tumour, assuming that HER2 status remains stable through cancer progression. However, it is frequent to find reports that describe discordance between HER2 expression in primary and metastatic tumours. The aim of this paper was to verify whether HER2 status of breast carcinomas is maintained in the corresponding axillary metastasis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 52 breast carcinomas and their matched axillary metastasis. HercepTest results were concordant in 46 out of 52 cases (88.5%). FISH proved that the differences observed were clinically relevant in only one of the 52 cases studied (98% concordance). We concluded that HER2 status was stable during axillary metastatic progression. Evaluation of gene HER2 status in axillary metastasis rather than in the primary can be useful in certain situations, e.g., small invasive component intimately mixed with in situ component and difficult to recognize in dark field, no tumor after biopsy, or axillary relapse (in this case we can find occasional de novo amplifications susceptible to trastuzumab treatment).",

The mechanisms by which the cancer-preventing effects of olive oil can be performed, however, are not known. We recently hypothesized that a novel molecular explanation concerning the anti-cancer actions of olive oil may relate to the ability of its monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) oleic acid (OA; 18:1n-9) to specifically regulate cancer-related oncogenes. Supporting our hypothesis, exogenous supplementation of cultured breast cancer cells with physiological concentrations of OA was found to suppress the overexpression of HER2 (Her-2/neu, erbB-2), a well-characterized oncogene playing a key role in the etiology, progression and response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in approximately 20% of breast carcinomas. OA treatment was also found to synergistically enhance the efficacy of trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody binding with high affinity to the ectodomain (ECD) of the Her2-coded p185(HER2) oncoprotein. Moreover, OA exposure significantly diminished the proteolytic cleavage of the ECD of HER2 and, consequently, its activation status, a crucial molecular event that determines both the aggressive behavior and the response to trastuzumab of Her2-overexpressing breast carcinomas. Our most recent findings further reveal that OA exposure may suppresses HER2 at the transcriptional level by up-regulating the expression of the Ets protein PEA3 -a DNA-binding protein that specifically blocks HER2 promoter activity- in breast, ovarian and stomach cancer cell lines. This anti-HER2 property of OA offers a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism by which olive oil may regulate the malignant behavior of cancer cells. From a clinical perspective, it could provide an effective means of influencing the outcome of Her-2/neu-overexpressing human carcinomas with poor prognosis. Indeed, OA-induced transcriptional repression of HER2 oncogene may represent a novel genomic explanation linking \"Mediterranean diet\", olive oil and cancer as it seems to equally operate in various types of Her-2/neu-related carcinomas.",

They have long been divided into those that are hormone sensitive [as defined by expression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and/or the progesterone receptor (PR)] and those that are not. Notably, only those breast cancers that express ERalpha and/or PR typically respond to hormonal therapy with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or the newer agent fulvestrant. More recently, the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER-2/neu was identified as an oncogene overexpressed by about 30% of breast cancers. These HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancers define a subset of breast tumors that are characteristically more aggressive, and women who develop them have a shorter survival. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for HER-2/neu, has revolutionized the management of metastatic HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancers. As a single agent, it produces response rates similar to those of many single-agent chemotherapeutic agents active in metastatic breast cancer and has limited toxicity. Combining trastuzumab with chemotherapy can result in synergistic antitumor activity. The clear efficacy of trastuzumab against HER-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer has led to a keen interest in testing its role in the management of early breast cancer, and multiple large clinical trials are currently in progress.

These molecular subtypes include: basal cell-like, Her-2/neu, luminal A, and luminal B.;To analyze the prevalence and clinicopathologic associations for molecular breast cancer subtypes in premenopausal and postmenopausal African-American women.;A retrospective analysis of all African-American women diagnosed with breast cancer from 1998 to 2005, who had assessable data for ER, PR, and Her-2/neu status. Molecular subtype classification was done based on immunohistochemical surrogates for ER, PR, and Her-2/neu status obtained from Howard University tumor registry for each patient. The molecular subtypes were defined as: luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2-), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-), and Her-2/neu (ER-, PR-, and HER2+).;We analyzed the prevalence of molecular breast cancer subtypes in a population of African-American women and determined their associations with patient demographics and clinicopathologic variables: node status, tumor size, histological grade, p53 mutation status, and breast cancer-specific survival.;The luminal A subtype was the most prevalent in our study sample (55.4%) compared with (11.8%) luminal B, (21.2%) basal cell-like, and (11.6%) Her-2/neu subtypes. The molecular subtypes did not differ by menopausal status. However, when stratified into age-specific groups, the basal cell-like subtype (57.1%) was the most prevalent in the age group <35 y compared with luminal A, luminal B, and Her-2/neu subtypes at 25.0%, 14.3%, and 3.6%, respectively. The basal cell-like subtype also showed an age-specific bimodal distribution with a peak in the <35 y and 51 to 65 y age groups. The basal cell-like and the Her-2/neu subtypes showed an increased association with clinicopathologic variables portending a more aggressive clinical course when compared with luminal A subtype. A paradoxical inverse relationship between the expression of p53 and Bcl-2 protooncoprotein was noted in the molecular subtypes. Breast cancer-specific survival differed significantly among the molecular subtypes (P < 0.04), with the basal cell-like and Her-2/neu subtypes having the poorest outcome.;The high prevalence of the basal cell-like subtype in the young premenopausal African-American women aged <35 y could be a contributory factor to the poorer prognosis of breast cancer observed in this cohort of patients.",

At 85th percentile the sensitivity of HER-2/neu was 51.12 %; the specificity was 86.29 % and the overall accuracy was 64.56 %. The sensitivity of CA15-3 was 73.13 %; the specificity was 85.14 % and the overall accuracy was 77.88 %.

Its overexpression is closely associated with poor prognosis in the course of disease. Here we demonstrate HER-2/neu overexpression in both established cell lines and biopsy material obtained from renal epithelial tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of human kidney tumor lesions using 2 HER-2/neu-specific antibodies revealed HER-2/neu expression in more than 40% of primary epithelial renal tumors and more than 30% of primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) specimens. A distinctive HER-2/neu expression pattern was found in different subtypes of kidney tumors with the highest frequency in chromophilic and chromophobic RCC, but neither associated with disease stage nor tumor grade. Eight of 10 RCC cell lines expressed significant levels of HER-2/neu mRNA and protein, but at a lower level compared with HER-2/neu overexpressing ovarian carcinoma cells. To evaluate the immune response against HER-2/neu expressing HLA-A2-positive (HLA-A2(+)) RCC cells, allogeneic HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines generated by pulsing dendritic cells with 3 different HER-2/neu-derived peptides, (HER-2(9.369), HER-2(9.435) and HER-2(9.689), were utilized in chromium-release assays. Specific lysis of HER-2/neu expressing HLA-A2(+) RCC cell lines was mediated by CTL lines specific for each of these 3 HER-2/neu-derived epitopes. The fine specificity of 2 CTL clones was defined to the epitopes HER-2(9.435) and HER-2(9.689). Their specificity was then confirmed by cold target inhibition assays. In addition, CTL-mediated lysis was enhanced by pulsing tumor cells with exogenous HER-2/neu-specific peptides. Our data suggest that (i) HER-2/neu is heterogeneously expressed in different subtypes of RCC, (ii) HER-2/neu is naturally processed by RCC and (iii) HER-2/neu epitopes presented by RCC can be recognized by HLA-A2-restricted, HER-2/neu-specific CTL.",

To test the efficacy of immune-based strategies in eliciting an antitumor response, we used the N#202 transgenic mouse model engineered to overexpress the rat neu proto-oncogene under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter; females of this line develop spontaneous focal mammary tumors by 6 months of age. Transgenic mice immunized intramuscularly with a HER-2 cDNA ligated into the VR1012 (VICAL) expression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter developed significantly fewer spontaneous tumors as compared with mice injected with the empty vector (P < 0.0001) or not injected (P = 0.0006). However, this protection was observed only when immunization was started in 3-month-old but not in 6-month-old mice. These data suggest that the xenogeneic HER-2 DNA sequence can break immune tolerance to rat neu in transgenic N#202 mice and induce protective immunity that impairs the neu oncogene-driven progression of mammary carcinogenesis.

Improvement of our knowledge of altered molecular events leading to the proliferation of tumor cells has resulted in the development of targeted therapies in subgroups of cancers. One of the first validation of targeted therapy is the anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) occurring in 20 to 25% of invasive breast carcinoma. Trastuzumab binds the extracellular juxtamembrane domain and is only active in tumor with HER2 gene amplification detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The results from randomized trials have rapidly lead to the approvement of the drug in the metastatic and then in the adjuvant setting. Another targeted therapy, also approved in the treatment of breast cancer, is the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab with an anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) activity. We will review the benefit of these targeted therapies in breast cancer and their role in the treatment of breast cancer.",

Her-2/neu gene amplification is known to be one of the most common genetic alterations associated with breast cancer and its accurate determination has become necessary for the selection of patients for trastuzumab therapy. The aim of this study was to prove the consistency of chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) technique after analyzing the overexpression of the Her-2/neu proto-oncogene in 100 invasive breast carcinomas and by comparing CISH results with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Moreover, it was done to evaluate the possible correlation of estrogen (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs), the proliferation marker Ki67 and the tumour suppressor gene p53 with HER-2/neu status of these breast carcinomas. Of the 100 breast carcinomas that were analysed, 22 cases showed HER-2/neu amplification, 66 cases showed no amplification, whereas 12 cases were non-interpretable in both assays (FISH and CISH). Consequently, the overall concordance between FISH and CISH was 100%. Additionally, it was observed that when HER-2/neu gene was overexpressed, there was an association with negative PRs and ERs status, negative p53 protein expression and high Ki67 labelling index. It is concluded that patients with tumours scoring 2+ with the CBE356 antibody (borderline immunohistochemistry-tested cases) would also benefit from CISH as it is shown to be highly accurate, practical and can be easily integrated into routine testing in any histopathology laboratory. Finally, CISH represents an important addition to the HER2 testing algorithm.",

Absence of BRCA1 or functional overexpression of the HER-2/neu gene presumably contributes to the somatic phenotype of breast cancer in premenopausal women, characterized by unfavorable prognostic features such as high tumor grade, hormone receptor negativity, and high proliferation rate. To examine whether amplification of HER-2/neu contributes to the aggressive biology of BRCA1-associated tumors, we have performed fluorescence in situ hybridization on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue sections from 53 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 41 randomly selected, age-matched sporadic breast cancer cases. Although BRCA1-associated and sporadic tumors were equally likely (19% versus 22%) to exhibit HER-2/neu amplification [defined as a ratio of HER-2/neu copies to chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) copies > or = 2], 6 (15%) of the sporadic tumors were highly amplified (defined as a ratio greater-than-or-equal 5) versus none of the BRCA1-associated tumors (P = 0.048). HER-2 protein overexpression as measured by immunohistochemical analysis was not observed among the BRCA1-associated cases (P = 0.042). Four of 21 (19%) sporadic tumors exhibited strong membranous staining of HER-2 (intensity level of 3+) as compared with 0 of 39 BRCA1-associated tumors. Our data suggest that a germ-line mutation in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene is associated with a significantly lower level of HER-2/neu amplification. Thus, it is possible that BRCA1-associated and HER-2/neu-highly amplified tumors progress through distinct molecular pathways, and the aggressive pathological features of BRCA1-associated tumors appear unrelated to amplification of the adjacent HER-2/neu oncogene.",

Despite controversy of cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in breast cancer, some studies indicate gain of patients from this drug. The present study aimed to propose a priority setting model for administration of anti-angiogenic agents in breast cancer via assessment of tumor angiogenesis by the microvessel density (MVD) method and associations with clinicopathological characteristics (including simultaneous mutations of TP53 and HER-2 genes).;Age, axillary lymph nodes status, tumor size, stage and grade, estrogen and progesterone receptors status, HER-2/neu status (by immunohistochemistry and FISH test), TP53 mutation, Ki-67 (for proliferation assay) and CD34 (for angiogenesis assay) were assessed in 111 breast cancer patients. The molecular subtype of each tumor was also determined and correlations of simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes with angiogenesis and other clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated.;There were significant associations between simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes and all other parameters except tumor size. The degree of angiogenesis in the ERBB2 subtype was greater than the others. Younger patients showed a higher angiogenesis rate rather those older than 50 years.;Our results demonstrated that patients with simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes, those with ERBB2 molecular subtype and also younger women (often triple negative) seem more eligible for obtaining anti-angiogenic agents.

Up to 40% of ER- breast cancers have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression (HER2+), suggesting HER2 signaling might be a good target for chemoprevention for certain ER- breast cancers. Here, we tested the feasibility of the HER2-targeting agent lapatinib in prevention and/or early intervention of an ER-/HER2+ early-stage breast disease model. We found that lapatinib treatment forestalled the progression of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)-like acini to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-like acini in ER-/HER2+ human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) in 3D culture. Mechanistically, we found that inhibition of HER2/Akt signaling by lapatinib led to downregulation of GLUT4 and a reduced glucose uptake in HER2-overexpressing cells, resulting in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of these cells in 3D culture. Additionally, our data suggest that HER2-driven glycolytic metabolic dysregulation in ER-/HER2+ HMECs might promote early-stage breast disease progression, which can be reversed by lapatinib treatment. Furthermore, low-dose lapatinib treatment, starting at the early stages of mammary grand transformation in the MMTV-neu* mouse model, significantly delayed mammary tumor initiation and progression, extended tumor-free survival, which corresponded to effective inhibition of HER2/Akt signaling and downregulation of GLUT4 in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that lapatinib, through its inhibition of key signaling pathways and tumor-promoting metabolic events, is a promising agent for the prevention/early intervention of ER-/HER2+ breast cancer progression.

We identified a novel mechanism by which integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates ErbB2 expression, Ras activation, and the invasion of breast carcinoma cells. Here we show that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates Ras activity especially in serum-depleted condition. Down-regulation of beta(4) integrin by beta(4) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased Ras activity and carcinoma invasion whereas reexpression of this integrin restored Ras activity. ErbB2, a binding partner of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and EGFR modulated Ras activity, and integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulated phospho-EGFR level without affecting EGFR expression. We also found that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) is involved in ErbB2 expression. Depletion of beta(4) by shRNA reduced ErbB2 protein level without affecting ErbB2 mRNA level and reexpression of beta(4) increased ErbB2 protein level. Reduction of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, a rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation, decreased ErbB2 protein level, and beta(4) shRNA cells exhibited a shift in ErbB2 mRNA to light polysomes compared with control cells. These results show that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates ErbB2 through translational control. In summary, we propose a novel mechanism for ErbB2 up-regulation and Ras activation in serum-depleted breast cancer cells; integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates the expression of ErbB2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of EGFR and activation of Ras.

        "Doc_abstract":"Ligands of the ErbB family of receptors and estrogens control the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Overexpression of human EGF receptor HER-2 (erbB2) leads to amplified heregulin (HRG) signaling, promoting more aggressive breast cancer that is nonresponsive to estrogen and the antiestrogenic drug tamoxifen. Herstatin (Hst), a secreted HER-2 gene product, binds to the HER-2 receptor ectodomain blocking receptor activation. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of this HER-2 inhibitor on HRG-induced signaling, proliferation, and sensitivity to tamoxifen in breast cancer cells with and without HER-2 overexpression. The expression of Hst in MCF7 cells eliminated HRG signaling through both mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt pathways and prevented HRG-mediated proliferation. The loss in signaling corresponded to downregulation of the HRG receptors, HER-3 and HER-4, whereas HER-2 overexpression strongly stimulated the levels of both HRG receptors. Although Hst blocked HRG signaling in both parental and HER-2 transfected cells, it enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen only in the MCF7 cells that overexpressed HER-2. To evaluate further the efficacy of Hst as an anticancer agent, His-tagged Hst was expressed in transfected insect cells, purified, and added to the breast cancer cells. As in the transfected cells, purified Hst inhibited HER-3 levels and suppressed HRG-induced proliferation of MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells. In contrast, the HER-2 monoclonal antibody, herceptin, downregulated HER-2, but not HER-3. These results suggest the potential use of Hst against HRG-mediated growth of breast cancers with high and low levels of HER-2 and against tamoxifen resistance in HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer.",

Characterization of H2NTF shows that it is devoid of the tyrosine kinase domain but it readily interacts with full-length HER2 and other HER receptors. As a consequence, H2NTF acts as a dominant-negative, attenuating the signaling triggered by full-length HER receptors. Expression of H2NTF results in resistance to the treatment with low concentrations of trastuzumab in vitro. However, cells expressing H2NTF and non-expressing cells have similar sensitivity to trastuzumab in vivo, indicating that H2NTF/trastuzumab complexes trigger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.",

The humanized anti-HER-2/neu antibody Trastuzumab is under clinical evaluation in combination with chemotherapy against breast cancer. The combination of Trastuzumab and cisplatin is expected to be active against HER-2 / neu-expressing tumors. We examined the mechanisms of this combination effect against human solid tumor cells in the presence of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using an in vitro MTT assay. The growth-inhibitory effects of cisplatin (CDDP) on the tumor cells were not significantly affected by Trastuzumab in the absence of effector cells. CDDP alone at a dose of less than 12.5 mM did not affect the viability of PBMCs, as determined by MTT assay, suggesting that PBMCs could exert antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) at this CDDP concentration. The combination of Trastuzumab and CDDP showed higher cytotoxic effects against the tumor cells in the presence of PBMCs. The CDDP concentration required to inhibit tumor cell growth by 50% was reduced to approximately 20% by Trastuzumab in the presence of PBMCs at an effector/target ratio of 10. It may be important to select combined chemotherapeutic agents which do not diminish the ADCC activity of Trastuzumab via PBMCs.

Heterodimer interactions between HER-2 and HER-3 (erbB-3) are activated by neu differentiation factor/heregulin (HRG), and HER-2/HER-3 heterodimers are constitutively activated in breast cancer cells with HER-2 gene amplification. This indicates that inhibition of HER-2/HER-3 heterodimer function may be an especially effective and unique strategy for blocking the HER-2-mediated transformation of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we constructed a bicistronic retroviral expression vector (pCMV-dn3) containing a dominant negative form of HER-3 in which most of the cytoplasmic domain was removed for introduction into cells. By using a bicistronic retroviral vector in which the antibiotic resistance gene and the gene of interest are driven by a single promoter, we attained 100% coordinate coexpression of antibiotic resistance with the gene of interest in target cell populations. Breast carcinoma cells with HER-2 gene amplification (21 MT-1 cells) and normal mammary epithelial cells without HER-2 gene amplification from the same patient (H16N-2 cells) were infected with pCMV-dn3 and assessed for HER-2/ HER-3 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, p85PI 3-kinase and SHC protein activation, growth factor-dependent and -independent proliferation, and transformed growth in culture. Dominant negative HER-3 inhibited the HRG-induced activation of HER-2/HER-3 and signaling in H16N-2 and 21 MT-1 cells as well as the constitutive activation of HER-2/HER-3 and signaling in 21 MT-1 cells. Responses to exogenous HRG were strongly inhibited by dominant negative HER-3. In contrast, the proliferation of cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor was not apparently affected by dominant negative HER-3. The growth factor-independent proliferation and transformed growth of 21 MT-1 cells were also strongly inhibited by dominant negative HER-3 in anchorage-dependent and independent growth assays in culture. Furthermore, the HRG-induced or growth factor-independent proliferation of 21 MT-1 cells was inhibited by dominant negative HER-3, whereas the epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation of these cells was not: this indicates that dominant negative HER-3 preferentially inhibits proliferation induced by HER-2/HER-3.",

However, whether patients with HER2-negative breast cancer with activating mutations of ERBB2 also experience response to anti-HER2 therapies remains unclear. This case report describes a patient with HER2-nonamplified heavily pretreated breast cancer who experienced prolonged response to trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab and fulvestrant. Further molecular analysis demonstrated that her tumors had an elevated HER2 dimerization that corresponded to ERBB2 S310F mutation. Located in the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein, this mutation was reported to promote noncovalent dimerization that results in the activation of the downstream signaling pathways. This case highlights the fact that HER2-targeted therapy may be valuable in patients harboring an ERBB2 S310F mutation.",

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 655 resulting in a G to A transition (Ile655Val) in the transmembrane domain-coding region of this gene has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This study aims to determine the prevalence of the HER-2 genotype and its association with breast cancer in the Greek Christian and Greek Muslim population of Thrace, Greece. In this case-control study, we genotyped 56 patients (43 Christians and 13 Muslims) with primary breast cancer and 45 healthy women (32 Christians and 13 Muslims) for the Ile655Val polymorphism, with the PCR-RFLP method. The Val allele and the Val-containing genotypes were significantly more frequent in Muslims than in Christians (p=0.020 and p=0.008, respectively). Among the Greek Christian population, a 5-fold and a 3.1-fold increase in risk of breast cancer was associated with the Val-Val genotype and the Ile-Val or Val-Val genotypes (95% CI, 1.3-18.4; p=0.017 and aOR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.3; p=0.025; respectively) compared to homozygous Ile-Ile. No significant association was found in the Muslim population. Among the entire cohort, the Val allele confers a modest increase in breast cancer risk (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.9-7.6; p=0.076, for Val-Val and OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.9-5.2; p=0.079 for Ile-Val or Val-Val). This effect was even more pronounced in younger women. Among breast cancer patients, invasive carcinomas, low differentiation tumors, advanced stages, positive lymph nodes, high number of lymph nodes and HER-2 overexpression were more frequent in patients with allele Val than those with allele Ile. Our study proposes the allelic imbalance of Ile655Val polymorphism between Greek Christian and Greek Muslim populations of Thrace contributes to the inconsistent association between this SNP and breast cancer risk across these two different ethnic groups. The association of the HER-2 genotype with clinicopathologic characteristics and HER-2 expression may indicate its possible implication on the more aggressive phenotype.",

HER2/neu overexpression is a negative prognostic factor in breast cancer patients. Cancer cells that overexpress HER2/neu may also be less sensitive to chemotherapy. In order to further define mechanisms by which HER2/neu overexpression drives neoplastic cell growth and chemoresistance, antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs) have been utilized to selectively down-regulate HER2/neu expression in human breast cancer cells. Such antisense ODNs suppress HER2/neu mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent, sequence-specific manner. Down-regulation of HER2/neu expression in HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells inhibits cell cycle progression in G0/G1 and results in apoptotic cell death. In tissue culture studies, combined treatment of HER2/ neu overexpressing breast cancer cells with HER2/neu antisense ODNs and conventional chemotherapeutic agents results in synergistic inhibition of cancer cell growth and activation of apoptotic cell death mechanisms. These studies have been extended to demonstrate synergistic antitumor effects following systemic treatment with antisense ODNs plus doxorubicin in nude mice bearing human breast carcinoma xenografts. Collectively these findings demonstrate that HER2/neu overexpression stimulates anti-apoptotic cell survival mechanisms and suggest that HER2/neu antisense ODNs may be of use in cancer therapeutics.",

Present studies demonstrate that exposure to a novel hydroxamic acid analogue histone deacetylase inhibitor, LAQ824, induced p21WAF1 and p27KIP1 and caused growth arrest and apoptosis of human breast cancer SKBR-3 and BT-474 cells that possess amplification and overexpression of Her-2/neu. Treatment with LAQ824 depleted the mRNA and protein levels of Her-2/neu-encoded Her-2, which was associated with attenuation of pAKT, c-Raf-1, and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase levels. LAQ824 also induced the acetylation of heat shock protein (hsp) 90, resulting in inhibition of its binding to ATP, which has been shown to impair the chaperone association of hsp 90 with its client proteins, Her-2, AKT, and c-Raf-1. Consistent with this, treatment with LAQ824 shifted the binding of Her-2 from hsp 90 to hsp 70, promoting proteasomal degradation of Her-2. Thus, LAQ824 depletes Her-2 through two mechanisms: attenuation of its mRNA levels and promotion of its degradation by the proteasome. Following LAQ824 treatment, the cell membrane association, autotyrosine phosphorylation, and colocalization of Her-2 with HER-3 also declined. Cotreatment with LAQ824 significantly increased trastuzumab-induced apoptosis of BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells. This was associated with greater attenuation of Her-2, c-Raf-1, and pAKT levels. LAQ824 also enhanced taxotere-induced, epothilone B-induced, and gemcitabine-induced apoptosis of BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells. These findings suggest that LAQ824 is active against human breast cancer cells and has the potential to improve the efficacy of trastuzumab, taxotere, gemcitabine, and epothilone B against breast cancer with Her-2/neuamplification.",

Here we report that ErbB2 induces invasion and migration of MCF10A cells though up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. We also observed a marked reduction of an epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, and an induction of vimentin in ErbB2-MCF10A cells, suggesting that epithelial-mesenchymal transition may play a role in the ErbB2-induced invasion and migration of MCF10A cells. Overexpression of ErbB2 significantly activated p38 MAPK and Akt, while Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway was not activated by ErbB2. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we further show that p38 MAPK and Akt signaling pathways are crucial for the ErbB2-induced MMP-9 up-regulation, invasion and migration of MCF10A cells.

Analysis of TICs in model systems of breast cancer would offer uniform and accessible source of tumor cells and the power of mouse genetics to dissect these rare cells. The HER2/Neu proto-oncogene is overexpressed in an aggressive form of human breast cancer. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu transgenic mice develop mammary tumors that mimic human HER2 subtype breast cancer. Here, we report on the functional identification of mouse HER2/Neu TICs that can induce tumors after transplantation into the mammary gland of recipient mice. Secondary tumors formed after injecting MMTV-Neu TICs resemble primary tumors in the original transgenic mice and are organized in a hierarchy containing TICs as well as their nontumorigenic descendants. To study MMTV-Neu TICs in vitro, we grew tumorspheres under nonadherent culture conditions. Tumorsphere forming units (TFU) capable of producing tumorspheres retained tumorigenic potential and were indistinguishable by several criteria from TICs. Interestingly, MMTV-Neu TICs and TFUs were committed to the luminal cell fate when induced to differentiate in vitro. Our data define reproducible characteristics of the MMTV-Neu TIC and TFU, which help to explain marker expression profiles of HER2-positive breast cancer. In addition, the similarity between TICs and TFUs in this system provides a rationale for TFU-based screens to target tumor-initiating cells in HER2(+) breast cancer.",

To define the nature of the interaction between rhuMAb HER2 and other classes of cytotoxic drugs, we applied multiple drug effect/combination index (CI) isobologram analysis to a variety of chemotherapeutic drug/rhuMAb HER2 combinations in vitro. Synergistic interactions at clinically relevant drug concentrations were observed for rhuMAb HER2 in combination with cisplatin (CI=0.48, P=0.003), thiotepa (CI=0.67, P=0.0008), and etoposide (CI=0.54, P=0.0003).

Immunogenic HER-2/neu CTL epitopes have been used as vaccines for the treatment of HER-2/neu positive malignancies with limited success. By applying prediction algorithms for MHC class I ligands and proteosomal cleavages, in this study, we describe the identification of HER-2/neu decamer LIAHNQVRQV spanning residues 85-94 (HER-2(10(85))). HER-2(10(85)) proved to bind with high affinity to HLA-A2.1 and was stable for 4 h in an off-kinetics assay. This peptide was immunogenic in HLA-A2.1 transgenic (HHD) mice inducing peptide-specific CTL, which responded to tumor cell lines of various origin coexpressing human HER-2/neu and HLA-A2.1. This demonstrates that HER-2(10(85)) is naturally processed from endogenous HER-2/neu. Five of sixteen HER-2/neu+ HLA-A2.1+ breast cancer patients analyzed had HER-2(10(85))-reactive T cells ranging from 0.35-0.70% of CD8+ T cells. Depletion of T regulatory cells from PBMC enabled the rapid expansion of HLA-A2.1/HER-2(10(85))pentamer+/CD8+ cells (PENT+/CD8+), whereas significantly lower numbers of CTL could be generated from unfractionated PBMC. HER-2(10(85))-specific human CTL recognized the HER-2/neu+ HLA-A2.1+ tumor cell line SKBR3.A2, as determined by IFN-gamma intracellular staining and in the high sensitivity CD107alpha degranulation assay. Finally, HER-2(10(85)) significantly prolonged the survival of HHD mice inoculated with the transplantable ALC.A2.1.HER tumor both in prophylactic and therapeutic settings. These data demonstrate that HER-2(10(85)) is an immunogenic peptide, capable of eliciting CD8-mediated responses in vitro and in vivo, providing the platform for further exploitation of HER-2(10(85)) as a possible target for anticancer immunotherapy.",

Using a HER-2/neu transfected MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, we investigated the role of HER-2/neu overexpression on resistance to paclitaxel and docetaxel treatment. A control vector transfected MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line (MCF/neo) and a HER-2/neu transfected MCF-7 line (MCF/18) were treated with various concentrations of docetaxel or paclitaxel. Cell number was assessed using the MTT tetrazolium dye assay. In the control vector transfected MCF/neo cell line, paclitaxel and docetaxel gave similar dose-dependent growth inhibition ( p = 0.175). In HER-2/neu transfected MCF/18 cells, docetaxel treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition similar to that seen in MCF/neo cells. Paclitaxel, however, gave significantly less growth inhibition than docetaxel in the HER-2/neu overexpressing MCF/18 cells (p = 0.0003). These data suggest that HER-2/neu overexpression may contribute to paclitaxel resistance. In contrast, the cytotoxic effects of docetaxel in these breast carcinoma cells are not affected by HER-2/neu expression.

The specific alterations that govern this transition have not been elucidated. HER2/neu is frequently overexpressed in DCIS but is less common in IBC, thereby suggesting additional requirements for transformation. To identify genes capable of cooperating with HER2/neu to fully transform mammary epithelial cells, we used an insertional mutagenesis screen on cells isolated from wild-type neu expressing mice and identified the E3 ligase HACE1 as HER2 cooperative tumor suppressor gene. Loss of HACE1 expression is commonly seen in clinical breast cancer data sets. HACE1 downregulation in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) results in the accumulation of the activated GTP-bound Rac1 partially transforming these cells. Overexpression of HER2 activates Rac1, which further accumulates upon HACE1 loss resulting in Rac1 hyperactivation. Although the knockdown of HACE1 or overexpression of HER2 alone in HMECs is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, HER2 overexpression combined with HACE1 downregulation fully transforms HMECs resulting in robust tumor formation. The pharmaceutical interference of Rac function abrogates the effects of HACE1 loss both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in marked reduction in tumor burden. Our work supports a critical role for HACE1 in breast cancer progression and identifies patients that may benefit from Rac-targeted therapies. ",

Additionally, EGFR and HER-2/neu status were concordant among multiple CNS metastases per individual case in only 45% of patients.;Thirty-nine percent of patients with metastatic breast cancer express EGFR, with parallel expression between metastatic sites and the primary neoplasm in 82% of the cases. The discordance in 18% of the cases, however, suggests that anti-EGFR agents might not show equal efficacy against metastatic tumor deposits and the primary tumor within a given patient. An additional corollary for pathologists based on this nonhomogeneity of receptor expression is that both the primary breast and multiple metastatic tumor deposits may need to be individually assessed for EGFR status. In our study, most metastatic tumor deposits showed expression for either EGFR or HER-2/neu, and less often for both, implying that drug therapies could be individualized for patients based on test results for both receptors.",

However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients despite treatment in as early as 10 months. Identification of subpopulations best suited for and most likely to respond to Herceptin is of utmost importance. We analyzed the signaling pathways of HER-2 and found that HER-2 shares a very similar downstream network with VEGFA, while LGR5 lies in the upstream of VEGFA and could promotes its expression through CTNNB1. This discovery suggests that the LGR5 directed VEGFA overexpression may activate downstream signals of HER-2 despite Herceptin treatment. Here, we hypothesized that in LGR5 overexpressing breast cancer cases, activation of VEGFA-VRGFR bypass may account for the resistance to HER-2 directed therapies. Concurrent inhibition of VEGFR might enhance Herceptin sensitivity and moreover reverse the resistant phenotype in HER-2 positive breast cancer. Thus, we proposed alternate regimens to increase the efficacy of Herceptin-based therapy. Nevertheless, wet lab experiments and clinical trials are still required.",

Moreover, HER-2(9(828))-specific human CTL recognized the tumor cell line SKOV3.A2 as well as the primary RS.A2.1.DR1 tumor cell line both expressing HER-2/neu and HLA-A*0201. Finally, therapeutic vaccination with HER-2(9(828)) in HHD mice was proven effective against established transplantable ALC.A2.1.HER tumors, inducing complete tumor regression in 50% of mice. Our data encourage further exploitation of HER-2(9(828)) as a promising candidate for peptide-based cancer vaccines.",

Although there is extensive literature on the expression of single HER-2 and EGFR receptors in breast cancer, little is known concerning the simultaneous expression at the mRNA level of these four receptors in human breast tissue and their influence in downstream signaling pathways that control cell cycle and proliferation.;The mRNA expression pattern of the four HER-receptors has been investigated and correlated with the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21(Waf1) and p27(Kip1) in 67 breast cancer specimens.;A positive correlation between HER-3 and HER-4 mRNA levels and a negative correlation between HER-2 and HER-3 was found. Compared to normal breast tissue, all four receptors were overexpressed in breast tumors and the strongest overexpression was found for HER-3 (p = 0.001). HER-4 expression was inversely related to histopathological grading (HPG), suggesting that elevated HER-4 mRNA expressions could be a biological marker of a more differentiated phenotype. The expression of p21(Waf1) protein was higher in HER-2-negative tumors, compared to HER-2-positive breast carcinomas. Compared to normal breast tissue, p21delta, the 19 kDa degraded form of p21 protein, was markedly expressed in breast cancer (p < 0.001). Conversely, p27(Kip1) was positively associated with HER-2 receptor and inversely associated with HER-3.;The HER family members are overexpressed in breast cancer.

To identify the molecular events responsible for effective tumor prevention and to define the tumor gene expression signature, we used microarrays to analyze the expression profile of mammary tissue of untreated transgenic mice and of vaccine-treated, tumor-free mice at different time points. Mammary tissue from vaccinated mice displayed a gene expression profile different from that of untreated, tumor-bearing mice but similar to that of normal/hyperplastic mammary gland. Comparison of treated and untreated mice at 15 weeks of age revealed up-regulation of genes encoding antibodies, chemokines, gamma-interferon-induced genes and inflammatory molecules, and down-regulation of early genes induced by tumor development. The gene expression signature of HER-2/neu-transformed tumor cells showed modulation of genes promoting proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and metastasis and inhibiting apoptosis and immune response. Meta-analysis of microarray data on human breast cancer showed that the signature of tumors arising in murine HER-2/neu transgenic model correctly classified human HER-2/neu-expressing tumors and normal breast tissue. Moreover murine and human HER-2/neu-positive tumors share the signature of basal-like breast cancers.

Human clinical data and our in vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggest potent oncogenic cooperation between mutant p53 and Her2 (ErbB2). Yet, the translational significance of mutant p53 in Her2 positive breast cancer, especially with respect to Her2-targeted therapies, has not been evaluated. Our previous work identified novel oncogenic activity of mutant p53 whereby mutp53 amplifies ErbB2 signaling via the mutp53-HSF1-ErbB2 feed-forward loop. Here we report that pharmacological interception of this circuit by ErbB2 inhibitor lapatinib downregulates mutant p53 in vitro and in vivo. We found that ErbB2 inhibition by lapatinib inhibits transcription factor HSF1, and its target Hsp90, followed by mutant p53 degradation in MDM2 dependent manner. Thus, our data suggest that mutant p53 sensitizes cancer cells to lapatinib via two complementary mechanisms: mutant p53 mediated amplification of ErbB2 signaling, and simultaneous annihilation of both potent oncogenic drivers, ErbB2 and mutant p53. Hence, our study could provide valuable information for the optimization of therapeutic protocols to achieve superior clinical effects in the treatment of Her2 positive breast cancer.",

In a previous study on HNSCC cell lines, we found that epigalocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major biologically active component of green tea, inhibited activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and thereby inhibited EGFR-related downstream signaling pathways in HNSCC cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of EGCG on activation of the HER-2 receptor in human HNSCC and breast carcinoma cell lines that display constitutive activation of HER-2. Treatment of these cells with 10 or 30 microg of EGCG, respectively, doses that cause 50% inhibition of growth, markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of HER-2 in both cell lines. This was associated with inhibition of Stat3 activation, inhibition of c-fos and cyclin D1 promoter activity, and decreased cellular levels of the cyclin D1 and Bcl-XL proteins. Although these concentrations of EGCG are quite high, we found that concentrations of 0.1-1.0 microg/ml, which are in the range of plasma concentrations after administering a single oral dose of EGCG or a green tea extract, markedly enhanced the sensitivity of both types of cell lines to growth inhibition by Taxol, a drug frequently used in the treatment of breast carcinoma and HNSCC.

Recently, a molecular connection between the HER -2/ neu (c- erb B-2) oncogene and FAS has been described in human breast cancer cells. Here, we examined the relationship between breast cancer-associated FAS hyperactivity and HER -2/ neu -induced breast cancer chemoresistance to taxanes. Co-administration of docetaxel (Taxotere) and the mycotoxin cerulenin, a potent and non-competitive inhibitor of FAS activity, demonstrated strong synergism in HER -2/ neu -overexpressing and docetaxel-resistant SK-Br3 cells, modest synergism in moderately HER -2/ neu -expressing MCF-7 cells, and it showed additive effects in low HER -2/ neu -expressing and docetaxel-sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells. Sequential exposure to cerulenin followed by docetaxel again yielded strong synergism in SK-Br3 cells, whereas antagonistic and moderate synergistic interactions were observed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Importantly, inhibition of FAS activity dramatically decreased the expression of HER -2/ neu oncogene in SK-Br3 breast cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating that FAS is playing an active role in HER -2/ neu -induced breast cancer chemotherapy resistance.",

While on combination treatment she developed cerebellar metastases. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that her disease continued to respond in the liver, lungs, and bone. This case suggests that failure of trastuzumab to cross the blood-brain barrier may compromise its overall effectiveness and raises the possibility that the central nervous system (CNS), or other sanctuary sites, may become clinically more significant in patients with breast cancer in the era of antibody-based therapies.",

We compared clinically relevant strategies of predictive testing and subsequent trastuzumab treatment of HER-2-positive patients only. FISH testing was the most cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €12,245 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, compared to no trastuzumab treatment. The next best strategy was parallel IHC and FISH, with costs of €400,154/QALY gained compared to FISH alone.

A series of 106 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma was similarly processed and tested. Lymph node status was available for 155 (88%) of the 177 cases and 82 (46%) were lymph node-negative (LN-) and 73 (41%) were lymph node-positive (LN+).

Multivariate analysis of the lobular group alone revealed that LN+ status (P = 0.015) and stage (P = 0.01) were independent predictors of disease-related death, and HER-2/neu gene amplification reached near significance (P = 0.086).

However, soluble human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)/neu protein as a vaccine has not been immunogenic. When protein is directly targeted to antigen uptake receptors, such as DEC205 (DEC), efficient processing and presentation of antigen take place. The aim of this study was to determine the immunogenicity of a HER2 protein vaccine that directly targets to DEC+ dendritic cells (DCs) in a mouse breast cancer model.;We genetically engineered the HER2 extracellular domain into a monoclonal antibody specific for DEC (DEC-HER2). Mice of various genetic backgrounds were immunized with DEC-HER2 in combination with DC maturation stimuli (poly IC ± CD40 Ab). Vaccine-induced T cell immunity was determined by analyzing the ability of CD4+/CD8+ T cell to produce interferon (IFN)-gamma and proliferate upon antigen rechallenge. Sera were assessed for the presence of antigen specific antibody (Ab). For vaccine efficacy, FVB/N mice were immunized with DEC-HER2 in combination with poly IC and protection against neu-expressing mammary tumors was assessed. Protection mechanisms and tumor-specific T cell responses were also evaluated.;We demonstrate that DEC-HER2 fusion mAb, but not Ctrl Ig-HER2, elicits strong, broad and multifunctional CD4+ T cell immunity, CD8+ T cell responses, and humoral immunity specific for HER2 antigen. Cross-reactivity to rat neu protein was also observed. Importantly, mice xeno-primed with DEC-HER2 were protected from a neu-expressing mammary tumor challenge. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediated the tumor protection. Robust anti-tumor T cell immunity was detected in tumor protected mice.;Immunization of mice with HER2 protein vaccine targeting DEC+ DCs in vivo induced high levels of T- and B-cell immunity. Non-targeted HER2 protein was poorly immunogenic for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This vaccination approach provided long-term survival benefit for mice challenged with neu-expressing tumor following as little as 2.7 μg of HER2 protein incorporated in the vaccine. Vaccine-induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were both essential for tumor protection.

Controversy exists as to the best method for its determination caused primarily by the variable sensitivities of the different antibodies and interobserver differences, particularly in the group of breast cancers with borderline levels of expression of the protein product. This study was therefore designed to determine the status of the HER2 gene amplification in a group of breast carcinomas with low levels of overexpression. After an initial validation of our procedures, a series of 52 consecutive cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancers with low levels of overexpression and a series of 22 cases with no expression by immunohistochemistry were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the results correlated statistically. Amplification of the HER2 gene was observed in 16% of equivocal to weakly positive cases. Those that were amplified showed low levels of amplification with ratios less than 4.5 and a characteristic scattered pattern of distribution of HER2 signals in the FISH assay. In addition, heterogeneity was noted in two cases in the amplification of the HER2 gene within the same tumor samples with pockets of amplified tumor cells amidst nonamplified tumor cells. In cases without amplification, a statistically significant number showed chromosome 17 polysomy. In conclusion, equivocal to low levels of HER2 overexpression in breast cancers are associated, in the majority of cases, with chromosome 17 polysomy and a corresponding increase in the HER2 gene numbers. True gene amplification is present in only a minority of cases. FISH analysis should be used for confirmation of gene amplification.

A PRL receptor (PRLR) antagonist, G129R, has been developed, which indirectly inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 (p-HER2) in human breast cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigate the effects of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) upon this molecular cross-talk using tumor cells and CAFs derived from spontaneous mammary tumors of female MMTV-neu transgenic mice. Tumors were resected and cultured as small tumor chunks (~3 mm3) or were cultured in monolayer. G129R reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu (p-Neu) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50~10 μg/ml) in tumor chunks, but had no effect on primary tumor epithelial cells grown in monolayer. Direct co-culture of mouse or human tumor epithelial cell lines with CAFs restored the epithelial cells' response to G129R, similar to that observed in mouse tumor chunks. The addition of PRL, as expected, induced p-Neu in both the tumor chunk and co-culture models. The inhibitory effect of G129R was absent when CAFs were physically separated from mouse tumor epithelial cells using a transwell system, or when CAFs were replaced with normal fibroblasts in direct co-culture with human or mouse tumor epithelial cells. In vivo, G129R reduced p-Neu levels in primary mammary tumors of mice in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, CAFs play a critical role in bridging the cross-talk between PRL and HER2/Neu in both mouse and human models of breast cancer. The inhibitory effects of G129R on p-Neu and on tumor growth are dependent upon interactions of tumor epithelial cells with CAFs.",

Here, we show that autocrine motility factor (AMF) binds to HER2 and induces cleavage to the ectodomain-deleted and constitutively active form p95HER2. Mechanistic investigations indicated that interaction of AMF with HER2 triggers HER2 phosphorylation and metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding, activating phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and ablating the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit breast carcinoma cell growth. Furthermore, we found that HER2 expression and AMF secretion were inversely related in breast carcinoma cells. On the basis of this evidence that AMF may contribute to HER2-mediated breast cancer progression, our findings suggest that AMF-HER2 interaction might be a novel target for therapeutic management of patients with breast cancer, whose disease is resistant to trastuzumab.",

To test this hypothesis in human breast cancer in vivo, we studied the relationship between the expression of both molecules in 247 breast carcinomas immunohistochemically. Five ductal carcinomas in situ overexpressed ERBB2 and showed preserved E-CD expression. Forty-four of 226 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (19.47%) showed ERBB2 overexpression, and a statistically significant relationship was found between ERBB2 overexpression and high histological grade. E-CD expression was preserved in 111 cases (49.1%) and correlated with the histological grade. However, no significant relationship was found between ERBB2 and E-CD expression. None of the 16 infiltrating lobular carcinomas expressed ERBB2 or E-CD. These observations in different histological types of breast carcinoma strongly argue against a role for ERBB2 as a transcriptional regulator of E-CD expression in most human breast carcinomas in vivo.",

Concerned about the ethnic differences on the expression of this oncogene, we have evaluated 143 consecutive specimens of primary breast cancer diagnosed in San Pablo Hospital, Puerto Rico.

In contrast to ER negative tumours in general, such tumours rarely harbour amplification of the HER-2 gene. However, little is known about TOP2A gene amplification status in BRCA1-associated tumours. Such information may be of importance to therapy, as amplification of TOP2A has been associated with dose-dependent sensitivity to anthracycline therapy in breast cancer. We examined 40 breast carcinomas from BRCA1 mutation carriers and 40 sporadic breast carcinomas matched for age, tumour diameter and histological grade for HER-2 and TOP2A amplification status using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Co-amplification of TOP2A and HER-2 was found in four of the mutation carriers and in three of the controls. While six tumours in the control group harboured HER-2 amplifications with normal TOP2A, this occurred in three of the BRCA1 associated tumours only. In contrast, three of the BRCA1-associated tumours but none of the controls harboured TOP2A amplification despite normal HER-2 status. Our findings have potential therapeutic implications.

Ninety nine cases of breast tumors were recruited from the pathology department archive of King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ER, PR and HER2 expression was assessed using IHC staining. Ductal carcinomas with a variety of histological grades constituted 88 (88.8%) of total cases. Seventy four (77.8%), 59 (62.1%), and 35 (36.8%) of ductal carcinomas showed positive staining for ER, PR and HER2, in that order. Remaining breast cancer cases were four (4%) lobular carcinomas and two (2%) mixed form of ductal and lobular types, which were ER+, PR+, and HER2-. Breast cancer expression pattern of ER, PR and HER2 in Saudi female is different from that of Tunisian and Jordanian female populations and closer to the expression pattern of Egyptian, Lebanese, Iraqi and western country females. Furthermore, the present study found two IHC patterns of breast cancer ER+/PR-/HER2+ (5%) and ER+/PR-/HER2- (11.1%), which had not been reported in other Arabic studies. Thus the rates of IHC expression patterns in breast cancer show some variation among Arabic female populations. ",

The technique combines modified RNA extraction with complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis to achieve a high level of sensitivity. Utilizing this PCR-based gene expression assay, we were able to quantitate variable amounts of Her-2/neu mRNA in cell lines with established levels of gene expression and in clinical human breast cancer specimens. In clinical samples, mRNA levels correlated with intensity of immunoperoxidase staining for corresponding oncoprotein.

Understanding the underlying molecular events that promote breast cancer progression is necessary to improve treatment and prognostication. TGF-β receptor III (TBR3) is a member of the TGF-β signaling pathway, with functions in cell proliferation and migration in malignancies, including breast cancer. Recent studies propose that TBR3 may function as a tumor suppressor and that its loss may correlate with disease progression. However, there are limited data on the expression of TBR3 in breast cancer in relationship to tumor type, hormonal receptor status and HER-2/neu, and patient outcome. In this study, we investigated the expression of TBR3 in a cohort of 205 primary invasive breast carcinomas in tissue microarrays (TMAs), with comprehensive clinical, pathological and follow- up information. Sections were stained for TBR3 and evaluated for intensity of reactivity based on a 4-tiered scoring system (1 to 4; TBR3 low = scores 1-2; TBR3 high = scores 3-4). Of the 205 invasive carcinomas, 123 were luminal type (95 type A, 28 type B), 8 were HER-2 type, and 62 were triple negative (TN). TBR3 was high in 112 (55 %) and low in 93 (45 %) cases. Low TBR3 was associated with higher histological grade and worse disease free and overall survival, all features of biologically aggressive breast carcinomas. TBR3 was significantly associated with the subtype of breast cancer, as low TBR3 was detected in 95 % of TN compared to 22 % of luminal tumors (p < 0.0001). We discovered a significant association between low TBR3 protein expression, TN breast cancer phenotype, and disease progression. These data suggest that TBR3 loss might be linked to the development of TN breast cancers and pave the way to investigating whether restoring TBR3 function may be a therapeutic strategy against TN breast carcinomas.

The current in vivo rodent models for breast cancer do not adequately approximate the human disease. Thus, we developed a new series of models based on the direct introduction of activated oncogenes into in situ mammary ductal cells in the rat. So far we have introduced both activated ras and neu into the mammary parenchyma of the rat. Both oncogenes cause the development of mammary carcinomas without any additional exogenous intervention. The activated neu gene is, however, 200 times more penetrant than the activated ras gene. The carcinomas induced by both genes are more aggressive than those induced by chemical carcinogens. They are more often transplantable, locally invasive, and metastatic. Tumors arising from the introduction of the neu oncogene have a greater histopathological resemblance to human breast cancers than those associated with ras insertion. For example, within a week post-introduction of neu, lesions resembling ductal carcinomas in situ are observed in the rat mammary gland. These do not occur following ras introduction or exposure to chemical carcinogens. These models are helping to better define the cellular and molecular events associated with the multistage progression of breast cancer. They are also being used to develop models to evaluate chemopreventive approaches for breast cancer. For example, in the area of cancer prevention we have shown that hormonal intervention is more effective in preventing neu-initiated breast cancers than ras-initiated breast cancers. We have also shown that the chemopreventive monoterpene, d-limonene, can prevent ras-induced mammary tumors in this model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Ten cases of HER2-positive breast cancer continued on Herceptin therapy for 3 months after chemotherapy, and their peripheral blood was again drawn and assayed for CK-19 mRNA expression. Preoperatively, all cases of HER2-positive cancer were positive for CK19 mRNA in peripheral blood, but 6 cases of HER2-negative breast cancer were positive (33.3%), where there was a substantial difference between the two groups. After 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, CK19 positive rates in cases of HER2-positive and -negative breast cancer reduced by 93.3 and 11.1%, respectively, with a significant difference still existing. After 3 months of Herceptin therapy, expression of CK19 mRNA declined considerably in 10 cases of HER2 positive breast cancer (113.66 ± 88.65 vs 63.35 ± 49.27, P = 0.025).

        "Doc_abstract":"In breast cancer, the predominant genetic mechanism for oncogene activation is through an amplification of a gene. The HER-2 (also known as ErbB2/c-erbB2/HER-2/neu) oncogene is the most frequently amplified oncogene in breast cancer, and its overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcome. In addition to its important role in breast cancer growth and progression, HER-2 is also a target for a new form of chemotherapy. Breast cancer patients have been treated with considerable success since 1998 with trastuzumab, a recombinant antibody designed to block signaling through HER-2 receptor. HER-2 has also been implicated in altering the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to different forms of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, particularly of topoII-inhibitors (e.g., anthracyclines). Topoisomerase IIalpha gene is located just by the HER-2 oncogene at the chromosome 17q12-q21 and is amplified or deleted in almost 90% of the HER-2 amplified primary breast tumors. Recent data suggests that amplification and deletion of topoisomerase IIalpha may account for both relative chemosensitivity and resistance to anthracycline therapy, depending on the specific genetic defect at the topoIIalpha locus. Expanding our understanding of HER-2 amplification also changes its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. HER-2 is an oncogene that clearly can drive tumor induction and growth and is also a target for a new kind of chemotherapy, but its function as a marker for chemoselection may be due to associated genetic changes, of which topoisomerase IIalpha is a good example. Moreover, despite potential evidence that genes other than HER-2, such as topoisomerase IIalpha, may be more important predictors of therapeutic response in breast cancer, HER-2 status still has a very significant role in therapeutic selection, mainly as the major criterion for administering trastuzumab in treating breast cancer. Thus, the clinical and therapeutic importance of the HER-2 and topoisomerase IIalpha status to breast cancer management should only increase in the next few years.",

There is no published study about the features of Her-2 overexpressing breast carcinomas in North African women.;The aim of this study is to assess the prognostic significance of pathological features in a cohort of a Her-2 overexpressing breast carcinoma originating from the region of south Tunisia.;This study investigated a series of 100 patients followed from January 2006 to December 2011 for a Her-2 positive invasive breast carcinoma. Pathological features included in this study were: histological type, histological grade, tumor size, vascular invasion, perineural invasion, mitotic index, lymph nodes stage, positive lymph node capsular effraction, inflammatory infiltrates, nipple involvement and hormone receptors status.;Multivariate analysis showed that pT stage, pN stage, capsular effraction, vascular invasion, perineural invasion and Nipple involvement were independent prognostic factors for overall survival and disease free survival in patients free from distant metastasis at diagnosis. For patients with synchronous metastasis, there is no independent pathologic prognostic factor for survival.;Our study demonstrates that pathological features are important prognostic factors for non metastatic Her-2 overexpressing breast carcinomas. This supports the idea that HER2-positive disease is a heterogeneous entity. We believe that these findings reinforce the need to identify molecular predictors of benefit and resistance to anti-Her-2 based therapies.",

In contrast to the epithelial growth factor receptor (ErbB1), ErbB2 is not downregulated by ligand-induced mechanisms. Here we show that flotillins are involved in the stabilization of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane. In SKBR3 breast cancer cells and breast cancer tissue, a positive correlation between flotillin and ErbB2 expression levels could be demonstrated. Moreover, the tissue microarray analyses of biopsies from 194 patients diagnosed with carcinomas of the breast showed that flotillin-2 emerged as a potential predictor of prognosis in breast cancer. Depletion of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 leads to internalization and degradation of ErbB2. Furthermore, flotillin-1 and -2 were found to be in a molecular complex with ErbB2 and Hsp90. The depletion of one of these proteins results in disruption of this complex, followed by destabilization of ErbB2 at the membrane, and its internalization and degradation. As a consequence, ErbB2-triggered downstream signalling is inhibited. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism for interfering with ErbB2 signalling, which potentially can have clinical impact. ",

The HER-2/neu gene is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancers as a result of gene amplification and/or elevated transcription. In this study we investigated the association between the presence of HER-2/neu gene ampliflcation and appearance and/or progression of breast cancer. Paraffin embedded tumour tissue was obtained from 82 women with breast cancer. Blood samples from age matched healthy women served as control (n = 50). The amplification of HER-2/neu gene was determined by PCR amplification using appropriate primers. The amplification of HER-2/neu gene was significantly higher in women with breast cancer as compared with control (P < 0.05). Additionally, there were differences in the amplification status between node-positive and node-negative breast cancer patients.

We used a signal transduction antibody array to characterize the tyrosine phosphorylation profiles in heregulin (HRG alpha1)-treated BT474 breast cancer cells, and identified a group of 80 molecules in which tyrosine phosphorylation was highly regulated by HRG-enhanced HER-2/neu signalling. These phosphoproteins included many known HER-2/neu-regulated molecules (e.g., SHC, Akt, Syk and Stat1) and proteins that had not been previously linked to HER-2/neu signalling, such as Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), apoptosis repressor with CARD domain (ARC), and the tumour suppressor, protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A). Pharmacological inhibition with HER-2 inhibitor AG825, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98095, and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 confirmed that PP2A phosphorylation was modulated by the complicated, HER-2/neu-driven downstream signal network, with the PI3K and MEK1/2 positively, while the p38MAPK negatively regulating its tyrosine phosphorylation. In breast tumour specimens, expression of tyrosine-phosphorylated PP2A (pY307-PP2A) was highly increased in the HER-2/neu positive breast tumours, and significantly correlated to tumour progression, thus enhancing its potential prognostic value.

Vaccine strategies directed against HER-2/neu and other self tumor antigens require development of methods to overcome immune tolerance to self-proteins. In rats, rat neu peptide vaccines have been shown to be an effective way of circumventing tolerance to rat neu protein and generating rat neu-specific immunity. The present report validates that a similar peptide-based vaccine formulation is effective for inducing T-cell immunity to HER-2/neu protein in humans with breast and ovarian cancer. The vaccine formulation included groups of peptides derived from the HER-2/neu extracellular domain (ECD) or intracellular domain (ICD) mixed with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor as an adjuvant. These peptides were 15-18 amino acids in length and designed to elicit a CD4 T helper-specific immune response. Patients underwent intradermal immunization once a month for a total of two to six immunizations. To date, all of the patients immunized with HER-2/neu peptides developed HER-2/neu peptide-specific T-cell responses. The majority of patients (six of eight) also developed HER-2/neu protein-specific responses. Responses to HER-2/neu protein occurred with epitope spreading. Immune T cells elicited by vaccination were shown to migrate outside the peripheral circulation by virtue of generating delayed type hypersensitivity responses distant from the vaccine site, which indicated the potential ability to traffic to the site of tumor.

        "Doc_abstract":"The HER-2 (also known as ERBB2/ErbB2/c-erbB2/HER-2/neu) oncogene is the most frequently amplified oncogene in breast cancer and is also amplified in other forms of cancer. Beside its important role in tumor induction, growth and progression, HER-2 is also a target for new therapeutic approaches such as Herceptin (trastuzumab), a recombinant antibody designed to block signaling through the HER-2 receptor. In addition to Herceptin, which is in a wide clinical use for HER-2 amplified breast cancer, a number of various HER-2 directed immunological and genetic strategies, either targeting the HER-2 receptor, its signaling pathways or both HER-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) simultaneously, have demonstrated promising pre-clinical activity in HER-2 amplified carcinomas. Moreover, the HER-2 amplicon is known to contain more than 30 genes with altered copy numbers that could be therapeutic targets for chemotherapy. The topoisomerase IIalpha gene, TOP2A, is located adjacent to the HER-2 oncogene at the chromosome location 17q12-q21 and is either amplified or deleted (with equal frequency) in a great majority of HER-2 amplified primary breast tumors and also in tumors without HER-2 amplification. Recent experimental as well as numerous, large, multi-center trials suggest that amplification (and/or deletion) of TOP2A may account for both sensitivity or resistance to commonly used cytotoxic drugs, i.e. topoII-inhibitors (anthracyclines etc.), depending on the specific genetic defect at the TOP2A locus. The understanding of HER-2 amplification and its role in the pathogenesis of cancer is expanding, and a number of therapeutic strategies targeting either the HER-2 or its signaling pathways in cancer therapy are being investigated. Combining HER-2 targeting therapies with conventional forms of cytotoxic chemotherapy, where additional diagnostic tests such as those ascertaining TOP2A status, may be helpful for the ideal selection of patients for the combination therapy of an HER-2 targeting drug together with a cytotoxic drug such as topoII-inhibitor especially in the case of TOP2A amplification.",

An immunohistochemical study was conducted on 200 breast carcinoma specimens using the avidin-biotin peroxidase method. ABCG2 was expressed in 77% of cases of invasive ductal carcinoma. There was a statistically significant correlation between ABCG2 expression and each of the tumor grade, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and HER2 immunostaining, but no such association with progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor (ER) status.

Using a computational pathway-based approach, we interrogated clinical breast cancer genomic data sets for candidate non-oncogenic vulnerabilities in breast cancers that have genomic amplification of ERBB2, which encodes human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2). HER2-positive (HER2(+)) breast cancers showed increased expression of genes encoding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ERAD led to irrecoverable ER stress and selectively killed HER2(+) breast cancer cells. Cell death caused by ERAD inhibition partially depended on increased HER2-mTOR signaling, which imposed an increased proteotoxic burden on the ER. Cell death in response to ER stress required the IRE1α-JNK pathway, which was selectively suppressed in HER2(+) breast cancers by phosphatases that inactivate JNK. Accordingly, the cytotoxicity of inhibiting ERAD as well as JNK phosphatases was synergistic in HER2(+) but not in HER2-negative breast cancer cells. Therefore, our study suggests that reactivation of oncogene-induced stress by targeting stress-adaptive pathways may be a beneficial approach for therapy-resistant breast cancers.",

Little is known about the starting point of amplification of Her-2/neu and how it progresses from benign to malignant breast lesions. We attempted to address these questions by evaluating amplification of Her-2/neu in benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Twenty-six patients with Her-2/neu-overexpressing invasive ductal carcinomas (as judged by strong immunoreactivity with Her-2/neu antibody) and coexisting lesions of ductal hyperplasia (DH), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the vicinity of the invasive tumor (as judged by review of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections), as well as metastatic carcinoma in axillary lymph nodes (mets) were selected for this study. In the primary carcinomas, a close relationship was present between overexpression as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and amplification as demonstrated by FISH (85% concordance). Among these patients, amplification of Her-2/neu in ADH was demonstrated in 7 of 13 cases with ADH, and in DCIS, in 21 of 22 cases with DCIS. There was no amplification in DH or normal ductal epithelium. Significantly, in all 12 patients with synchronous positive axillary lymph nodes, there was concordant amplification of Her-2/neu in the primary and metastatic carcinoma. Amplification was consistent in multifocal metastases, despite morphological heterogeneity in some patients. Amplification ratios increased from ADH to DCIS to invasive carcinoma (P <.01, ADH versus DCIS; P <.05, DCIS versus invasive cancer), but there was no difference in amplification ratios between primary cancers and synchronous axillary metastases (P >.05). We also evaluated Her-2/neu amplification in 21 patients without Her-2/neu overexpression in their primary carcinomas (as judged by absent immunoreactivity with Her-2/neu antibody). Three showed amplification in both primary and metastatic lesions, with a low amplification ratio (approximately 2). One patient had amplification in the primary tumor but not in an axillary metastasis. Two patients exhibited slight amplification in the metastatic carcinoma (ratios 1.6 and 2), but not in their primary cancers. This FISH study indicates that amplification of Her-2/neu can emerge de novo in any stage of the disease process, from ADH to metastatic lesions, but most often appears first in ADH or DCIS. The degree of Her-2/neu amplification increases with progression to invasive carcinoma, there being no further increase in synchronous metastasis. Our data suggest that amplification of Her-2/neu appears to be mainly involved in initiation of breast oncogenesis and that its role in progression of breast cancers is uncertain.",

Inhibiting HER2 activity with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) or HER2 short interfering RNA in tumor cells down-regulates Ang-2 expression. Consistent with the important roles of AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase in the HER2 signaling pathway, AKT and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase activity is necessary for Ang-2 up-regulation by HER2. Moreover, overexpression of HER2 protein up-regulates Ang-2 expression. Heregulin-beta1-induced Ang-2 up-regulation is abrogated when AKT and ERK kinase activity are blocked. Immunohistochemical analysis of HER2 and Ang-2 proteins in human breast carcinomas shows that Ang-2 expression in breast cancer correlates with HER2 expression.

If using 15 ng/mL as a normal baseline, elevated serum HER-2 levels were observed in none of the healthy volunteers as well as patients with benign disease, but in 18.9% (10/53) operable breast cancer patients and 61.5% (16/26) metastatic patients. In patients with operable breast cancer, there was a positive correlation between serum concentrations of HER-2 and the size of primary tumor (P < 0.05), whereas there was no correlation between serum concentration and axillary lymph node or estrogen receptor status. In patients with metastatic disease, there was no correlation with site of metastases (P > 0.05).;Serum HER-2 level was strongly correlated with tumor loads and clinical stages, thus acting as a promising predictor of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients.",

Most of breast cancers reported in Indonesia are already large size, with high grade or late stage but the clinicopathological features of different molecular subtypes are still unclear. They need to be better clarified to determine proper treatment and prognosis.;To elaborate the clinicopathological features of molecular subtypes of breast cancers in Indonesian women.;A retrospective cross-sectional study of 84 paraffin-embedded tissues of breast cancer samples from Dr. Sardjito General Hospital in Central Java, Indonesia was performed. Expression of ER, PR, Her-2 and Ki-67 was analyzed to classify molecular subtypes of breast cancer by immunohistochemistry. The relation of clinicopathological features of breast cancers with molecular subtypes of luminal A, luminal B, Her-2 and triple negative/basal-like were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-Square test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.;Case frequency of luminal A, Luminal B, Her-2+ and triple negative/basal-like subtypes were 38.1%, 16.7%, 20.2% and 25%, respectively. Significant difference was found in breast cancer molecular subtypes in regard to age, histological grade, lymph node status and staging. However it showed insignificant result in regard to tumor size. Luminal A subtype of breast cancer was commonly found in >50 years old women (p:0.028), low grade cancer (p:0.09), negative lymph node metastasis (p:0.034) and stage III (p:0.017). Eventhough the difference was insignificant, luminal A subtype breast cancer was mostly found in small size breast cancer (p:0.129). Her-2+ subtype breast cancer was more commonly diagnosed with large size, positive lymph node metastasis and poor grade. Triple negative/basal-like cancer was mostly diagnosed among <50 years old women.;This study suggests that immunohistochemistry-based subtyping is essential to classify breast carcinoma into subtypes that vary in clinicopathological features, implying different therapeutic options and prognosis for each subtype.",

The c-erbB2 gene (HER-2/neu) is a proto-oncogene expressed in 10-34% of breast cancers. Its expression is associated with poor clinical outcome. The hypothesis that the progression of in situ ductal carcinoma of breast to invasive ductal carcinoma is associated with alterations of ER, PgR and HER-2/neu protein expression was tested. Of 100 mastectomy specimens examined, all contained both ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) not otherwise specified (NOS). The status of ER, PgR and HER-2/neu proteins was examined by immunochemistry. ER and PgR protein expression was scored as the mean value of positively stained cells. HER-2/neu protein expression was evaluated on ts staining pattern (0, 1+, 2+ and 3+). We found variations between DCIS and IDC with significant decrease of the mean values of ER and PgR positively stained cells in high-grade (Grade 3) IDC (ER: 49.2+/-10.3 vs. 30.8+/-5.5 and PgR: 40.0+/-10.0 vs. 22.3+/-5.1 in DCIS and IDC, respectively, P<0.05). Invasive carcinomas with lymph node metastases or lymphovascular invasion or both had lower mean values of ER and PgR positively stained cells compared to those without these features. In IDC (Grade 3), HER-2/neu protein expression values (1.2+/-0.2) were significantly high compared to DCIS (0.7+/-0.3, P<0.05). In addition, HER-2/neu protein expression values were significantly higher (P<0.05) in IDC with lymph node metastases or lymphovascular invasion (1.5+/-0.3) than those without these features (0.8+/-0.2). A significantly high mean (P<0.05) of ER and PgR positively stained cells was observed in postmenopausal females compared to premenopausal women. In contrast, high HER-2/neu expression values were seen only in premenopausal females. A significant positive correlation was observed between ER and PgR receptor expression (r=0.81). A low degree inverse correlation (r=-0.24, P<0.012) was found between ER+/PgR+ tumors and HER-2/neu expression. These findings substantiate the notion that breast cancer progression is often associated with alterations of ER, PgR and HER-2/neu expression.

Overexpression of this oncogene is directly associated with malignant transformation of epithelial cells. The frequency of HER-2 overexpression varies among the different types of cancers, but universally represents a marker of poor prognosis. The critical role of HER-2 in epithelial oncogenesis as well as its selective overexpression on malignant tissues makes it an ideal target for immunotherapy. Antibodies and T cells reactive to HER-2 are known to naturally occur in patients with HER-2 positive tumors, confirming the immunogenicity of the molecule. Both antibodies as well as T cells reactive to HER-2 have been utilized for immunotherapy of HER-2 positive tumors. The \"humanized\" monoclonal antibody Herceptin has been tested in several clinical trials and found to be an effective adjuvant therapy for HER-2 positive breast and ovarian cancer patients. However, the frequency of patients responding to Herceptin is limited and a majority of patients initially responding to Herceptin develop resistance within a year of treatment. The use of vaccination strategies that generate T cell responses with or without accompanying antibody responses may serve to mitigate the problem. Various strategies for generating T cell-mediated responses against HER-2 are currently being examined in animal models or in clinical trials. The potential advantages of the various approaches to immunotherapy, their pitfalls, and the mechanisms by which HER-2 positive tumors can evade immune responses are discussed in this review.",

The high rate of mortality is mainly caused by the difficulties of early detection of this disease and the lack of effective treatment for advanced stages of ovarian cancers when they are detected. One of the common pathological features of many primary ovarian cancers is the amplification/overexpression of a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, HER-2 (also known as neu or ErbB2) gene (1). Although there are some discrepancies in the literature (2), HER-2 overexpression in cancer cells correlates well with a greater resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in certain experimental systems (3). In addition, HER-2 overexpression has been shown to enhance metastatic potential in many different model systems (4). Therefore, the HER-2 gene has become an excellent target for developing therapeutic agents that could reverse malignant transformation of HER-2-overexpressing cancer cells (5).",

The incidence of HER2 overexpression (33% and 50%, respectively) and gene amplification (25% and 33%, respectively) among glycogen-rich and lipid-rich carcinomas was not higher than that observed in breast cancer generally.;Our data suggest that preferential involvement of the HER2 gene in micropapillary and apocrine breast carcinomas may contribute to their aggressive behaviour.",

The role of CB2 in oncogenesis was studied by generating a mouse line that expresses the human V-Erb-B2 Avian Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2 (HER2) rat ortholog (neu) and lacks CB2 and by a variety of biochemical and cell biology approaches in human breast cancer cells in culture and in vivo, upon modulation of CB2 expression by si/shRNAs and overexpression plasmids. CB2-HER2 molecular interaction was studied by colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays. Statistical tests were two-sided.;We show an association between elevated CB2 expression in HER2+ breast tumors and poor patient prognosis (decreased overall survival, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09 to 0.71, P = .009) and higher probability to suffer local recurrence (HR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.049 to 0.54, P = .003) and to develop distant metastases (HR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.75, P = .009). We also demonstrate that genetic inactivation of CB2 impairs tumor generation and progression in MMTV-neu mice. Moreover, we show that HER2 upregulates CB2 expression by activating the transcription factor ELK1 via the ERK cascade and that an increased CB2 expression activates the HER2 pro-oncogenic signaling at the level of the tyrosine kinase c-SRC. Finally, we show HER2 and CB2 form heteromers in cancer cells.;Our findings reveal an unprecedented role of CB2 as a pivotal regulator of HER2 pro-oncogenic signaling in breast cancer, and they suggest that CB2 may be a biomarker with prognostic value in these tumors.",

The expression of FoxD3, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki67 was examined by immunohistochemistry in samples from 121 patients with IDC. Non-tumorous breast adenosis tissues served as controls. HER2 expression was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The expression levels of FoxD3 in IDC tissues and the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were additionally measured by western blotting. A greater percentage of total IDC patients and patients with lymph node metastases showed reduced FoxD3 expression compared to adenosis controls (p<0.05). Overall, FoxD3 was associated with metastatic status of IDC but not with age, pathological or clinical staging, or status of HER-2, ER, or PR. In particular, FoxD3 protein expression was down-regulated in the tumor epithelia of IDC samples from patients with metastases. Furthermore, FoxD3 protein expression was decreased in the metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line relative to the non-metastatic cell line, MCF-7. A greater number of patients with invasive, triple-negative breast cancer were also negative for FoxD3 expression than in other, non-triple-negative tumor types.

HercepTest results classified semi-quantitatively as 2+ and 3+ were evaluated using a computer image analyzer and the p185 index was calculated. HER-2 amplification was carried out with FISH using a unique probe (HER-2) with a satellite probe (CEP17). The FISH reaction was assessed routinely by counting red fluorescence signals emitted by the HER-2 gene and additionally with AnalySIS software (AS). The latter method showed that the mean HER-2 amplification index in carcinomas determined as 2+ was significantly lower as compared to carcinomas defined as 3+ (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the mean amplification indices of carcinomas classified as 3+ and of 2+ cancers which manifested HER-2 amplification did not differ significantly. High HER-2 amplification values (HER-2/CEP17 > 5) were noted in a similar percentage of carcinomas classified by IHC as 2+ (45.5%) or 3+ (55.5%). No correlation was observed between the intensity of the immunohistochemical reaction to p185 as assessed by computer image analysis and the HER-2 amplification index either in breast carcinomas classified semi-quantitatively as 2+ or 3+. The p185 index in 2+ carcinomas without HER-2 amplification might be higher than in some cancers with HER-2 amplification or even higher than in some carcinomas with HER-2 amplification belonging to the 3+ class. Significant differences were noted in p185 expression between ductal and lobular carcinomas (p = 0.0001) and between lobular and medullar carcinomas (p = 0.003). Invasive ductal carcinomas revealed significant differences in p185 expression depending on histological grade (I degree vs III degree p = 0.02; II degree vs III degree p = 0.02), estrogen receptor expression (p = 0.01), and proliferative index (p = 0.02).",

Although tumorectomy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone replacement therapy have been used for the treatment of breast cancer, there is no effective therapy for patients with invasive and metastatic breast cancer. Immunotherapy may be proved effective in treating patients with advanced breast cancer. Breast cancer immunotherapy includes antibody based immunotherapy, cancer vaccine immunotherapy, adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy and T cell receptor gene transfer immunotherapy. Antibody based immunotherapy such as the monoclonal antibody against HER-2/neu (trastuzumab) is successfully used in the treatment of breast cancer patients with over-expressed HER-2/neu, however, HER-2/neu is over-expressed only in 25-30% of breast cancer patients. Cancer vaccine immunotherapy is a promising method to treat cancer patients. Cancer vaccines can be used to induce specific anti-tumor immunity in breast cancer patients, but cannot induce objective tumor regression. Adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy is an effective method in the treatment of melanoma patients. Recent advances in anti-tumor T cell generation ex vivo and limited clinical trial data have made the feasibility of adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer patients. T cell receptor gene transfer can redirect the specificity of T cells. Chimeric receptor, scFv(anti-HER-2/neu)/zeta receptor, was successfully used to redirect cytotoxic T lymphocyte hybridoma cells to obtain anti-HER-2/neu positive tumor cells, suggesting the feasibility of treatment of breast cancer patients with T cell receptor gene transfer immunotherapy.

In this proteomic study, to identify the proteins that are associated with the aggressive phenotype of HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer, tumor cells from both HER-2/neu-positive and -negative tumors were procured by laser capture microdissection. Differentially expressed proteins in the two subsets of tumors were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. We found differential expression of several key cell cycle modulators, which were linked with increased proliferation of the HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells. Nine proteins involved in glycolysis (triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and enolase 1 (ENO1)), lipid synthesis (fatty acid synthase (FASN)), stress-mediated chaperonage (heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27)), and antioxidant and detoxification pathways (haptoglobin, aldo-keto reductase (AKR), glyoxalase I (GLO), and prolyl-4-hydrolase beta-isoform (P4HB)) were found to be up-regulated in HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors. HER-2/neu-dependent differential expression of PGK1, FASN, Hsp27, and GLO was further validated in four breast cancer cell lines and 12 breast tumors by immunoblotting and confirmed by partially switching off the HER-2/neu signaling in the high HER-2/neu-expressing SKBr3 cell line with Herceptin treatment. Statistical correlations of these protein expressions with HER-2/neu status were further verified by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray comprising 97 breast tumors. Our findings suggest that HER-2/neu signaling may result, directly or indirectly, in enhanced activation of various metabolic, stress-responsive, antioxidative, and detoxification processes within the breast tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that these identified changes in the cellular proteome are likely to drive cell proliferation and tissue invasion and that the key cell cycle modulators involved, when uncovered by future research, would serve as naturally useful targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to negate the metastatic potential of HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors.",

This explains a lower response to anti-oestrogens if ER+ breast cancers are HER-2/neu positive. One randomized study however, showed that premenopausal women with an ER+ breast cancer respond to anti-oestrogens independent of HER-2/neu. We therefore hypothesized an age-related association between HER-2/neu and PR in ER+ breast cancers. Receptors for ER, PR and HER-2/neu were analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A uni- and multivariate analyses was carried out to assess this relationship in 1104 women with an ER+ breast cancer. We observed an inverse association between HER-2/neu and PR only after age 45. There were 173 women of age<or=45 and 931 of age>45 years. In multivariate analysis, only tumour grade (p=0.005) but not PR status was associated with HER-2/neu in women age<or=45 years. However, in age>45 years group, both PR status (p=0.001) and tumour grade (p=0.001) were independently associated with HER-2/neu.

        "Doc_abstract":"Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a humanized antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the tyrosine kinase orphan receptor Her-2/neu (erbB-2) that has shown therapeutic efficacy against Her-2/neu-overexpressing breast tumors. However, less than 35% of patients with Her-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer respond to trastuzumab as a single agent, whereas the remaining cases do not demonstrate tumor regression. Furthermore, the majority of patients who achieve an initial response generally acquire resistance within one year. Therefore, the identification of the potential mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab can be very helpful for the development of new compounds, which might overcome that resistance and/or have additive/synergistic antitumor effect when given in association with trastuzumab. Recent studies in breast cancer cells have revealed a bi-directional connection between Her-2/neu and fatty acid synthase (FAS), a major lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of long-chain saturated fatty acids from the 2-carbon donors malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Her-2/neu overexpression stimulates the FAS promoter and ultimately mediates increased endogenous fatty synthesis, and this Her-2/neu-mediated induction of breast cancer-associated FAS is inhibitable by trastuzumab. On the other hand, chemical FAS inhibitors as well as RNA interference-mediated silencing of FAS gene repress Her-2/neu gene expression at the transcriptional level. Moreover, specific FAS blockade synergistically sensitizes breast cancer cells carrying Her-2/neu-oncogene amplification and/or overexpression to trastuzumab-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Strikingly, FAS inhibition synergistically interacts with trastuzumab in Her-2/neu-negative breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress Her-2/neu, thus suggesting that the molecular linkage between FAS activity and functioning of Her-2/neu cannot be explained only on the basis of a transcriptional repression of Her-2/neu gene promoter. Interestingly, while in liver and adipose tissue FAS produces fat from excess carbon consumed as carbohydrates, which is ultimately stored as triglycerides, in epithelial cancer cells, FAS activity is mainly involved in the production of phospholipids partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (lipid raft-aggregates), which point to an active role of FAS in the deregulation of membrane functioning in tumor cells. Importantly, clusters of Her-2/neu and EGFR (erbB-1) co-localize with lipid rafts and the lipid environment in the cell membrane of breast cancer cells profoundly influences their association properties and biological functions. We hypothesize that pharmacological or small interference RNA-induced inhibition of breast cancer-associated FAS will result in major changes in the synthesis of phospholipids which, in turn, should impair a correct cellular localization of Her-2/neu at the cellular membrane of breast cancer cells. In this working model, FAS inhibition could induce a shift in the equilibrium between transport of Her-2/neu to and from the membrane favoring an increased Her-2/neu internalization followed by intracellular degradation, thus enhancing the mechanism of action of the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab. Moreover, the inhibition of FAS-driven lipid rafts will also negatively affect EGFR-Her-2/neu cross-talk, an important mechanism of trastuzumab resistance. In summary, the specific blockade of a novel molecular linkage between FAS-regulated membrane composition and functioning of transmembrane growth factor receptors EGFR and Her-2/neu may represent a previously unrecognized therapeutic approach circumventing trastuzumab resistance in breast carcinomas.",

To ascertain whether expression of activated Neu under the control of the endogenous promoter in the mammary gland could induce mammary tumors we have generated mice that conditionally express activated Neu under the transcriptional control of the intact endogenous Neu promoter. Expression of oncogenic neu in the mammary gland resulted in accelerated lobulo-alveolar development and formation of focal mammary tumors after a long latency period. However, expression of activated Neu under the normal transcriptional control of the endogenous promoter was not sufficient for the initiation of mammary carcinogenesis. Strikingly, all mammary tumors bear amplified copies (2-22 copies) of the activated neu allele relative to the wild-type allele and express highly elevated levels of neu transcript and protein.

Lapatinib is the first dual inhibitor of HER1 (EGFR, ErbB1) and HER2 (ErbB2, Neu) tyrosine kinases to be used in clinical practice. However, only HER2 is currently used for therapy indications and new predictors for the treatment with lapatinib are sought.;This minireview focuses on lapatinib and its role in breast cancer treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies as well as pharmacological characteristics are briefly reviewed while the focus is on efficacy assessment including predictive factors for therapy outcome.;Lapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb) was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2007 for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer in patients who had received previous treatment (including anthracycline, taxane and trastuzumab containing regimens) and in 2010 for use in combination with letrozole for postmenopausal women with hormonal receptor positive and HER2- positive metastatic breast cancer. In contrast to trastuzumab (Herceptin), lapatinib is orally administered and it targets both HER2 and HER1 receptors. As a synthetic and oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), it is convenient, cheaper and easier to produce than monoclonal antibodies. The recommended dosage is not dependent on body weight either. Lapatinib plasma level measurement could be an approach to tailored therapy for further optimizing the dose and prolonging this efficient therapy. New lapatinib response predictors are being evaluated. At this time, only HER2 amplification/overexpression is used to choose lapatinib therapy candidates. Further studies on concurrent HER1 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)/immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment and/or microarray analyses may produce new data on the predictive role of the HER1 (EGFR) gene/protein. PTEN loss and PIK3CA gene mutations are other markers that may predict lapatinib poor response.",

Using gene expression data and pathway signatures, we predicted a role for activator E2F transcription factors in Neu-induced tumors. This was genetically tested by interbreeding Neu transgenics with knockouts of the three activator E2Fs. Loss of any E2F delayed Neu-induced tumor onset. E2F1 loss accelerated tumor growth, while E2F2 and E2F3 loss did not. Strikingly, it was observed that loss of E2F1 or E2F2 significantly reduced the metastatic capacity of the tumor and this was associated with a reduction in circulating tumor cells in the E2F2 knockout. Gene expression analysis between the tumors in the various E2F-mutant backgrounds revealed that there was extensive compensation by other E2F family members in the individual knockouts, underscoring the importance of the E2Fs in HER2/Neu-induced tumors. Extension to HER2-positive (HER2+) human breast cancer revealed a number of HER2+ subtypes based on E2F activity with differences in relapse-free survival times. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the E2F transcription factors are integral to HER2+ tumor development and progression. ",

HER2 amplification and hyperactivation drive the growth and survival of breast cancers through the aberrant activation of proto-oncogenic signaling systems, particularly the Ras/MAP kinase and PI3K/AKT pathways. Although HER2-positive (HER2(+)) breast cancer was originally considered to be a highly aggressive form of the disease, the clinical landscape of HER2(+) breast cancers has literally been transformed by the approval of anti-HER2 agents for adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Indeed, pertuzumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that functions as an anti-HER2 agent by targeting the extracellular dimerization domain of the HER2 receptor; it is also the first drug to receive an accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in neoadjuvant settings in early-stage HER2(+) breast cancer. Here, we review the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of HER2 in breast cancer, as well as summarize the landmark preclinical and clinical findings underlying the approval and use of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. Finally, the molecular mechanisms operant in mediating resistance to anti-HER2 agents, and perhaps to pertuzumab as well, will be discussed, as will the anticipated clinical impact and future directions of pertuzumab in breast cancer patients.

These results were compared with HER-2/neu gene amplifications evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and their ability to predict disease survival. For FISH, sections 5 microns thick of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were processed using the Oncor Chromosome In Situ Hybridization System. Automated hybridization using the Ventana Gen was performed with the Oncor unique sequence digoxigenin-labeled HER-2/neu DNA probe. Gene copy numbers were evaluated using the Zeiss Axioskop50 fluorescence microscope. HER-2/neu amplification was noted in 24 (38%) of 63 cases. By multivariate analysis, only aneuploidy (P = .04) and HER-2/neu amplification by FISH (P = .04) independently correlated with survival. Although we saw a relationship between HER-2/neu protein expression and gene amplification, this trend did not achieve statistical significance. HER-2/neu oncogene amplification can be assessed using automated FISH on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. HER-2/ neu amplification predicts poor outcome in Stage I endometrial cancer.

We have previously reported that the adenovirus type 5 early region 1A (E1A) gene product can repress HER-2/neu overexpression by repressing HER-2/neu promoter activity, and suppress the tumorigenic potential of HER-2/neu-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells. To examine E1A tumor suppressor function in breast cancer, we transduced E1A in vitro by adenovirus into both HER-2/neu-overexpressing and low expressing human breast cancer cell lines. In HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells, E1A greatly inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro. However, in HER-2/neu low expressing cancer cell lines, E1A had no significant effect on cell growth in culture medium. To test the therapeutic efficacy of E1A, we used both adenovirus-mediated and cationic liposome-mediated E1A gene delivery systems in an orthotopic breast cancer animal model. An advanced breast cancer model was established by inoculation of HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer cells in mammary fat pad and treated by local injections of either replication-deficient adenovirus expressing E1A, Ad.E1A(+) or a liposome-E1A DNA complex. As controls, mice bearing tumors were also treated with Ad.E1A(-) which is virtually the same adenovirus as Ad.E1A(+) except that E1A is deleted, a liposome-E1A frame-shift mutant DNA complex, or just PBS. In mice bearing a HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell line, E1A delivered either by adenovirus or liposome significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival compared with the controls. In fact, 60-80% of E1A-treated mice lived longer than 2 years versus only 0-20% of control mice (P<0.05). Western blot analysis showed that E1A protein was expressed in tumor tissue and immunohistochemical analysis showed that HER-2/neu p185 protein expression was suppressed. Taken together, our results indicated that both adenovirus and cationic liposome delivery systems were effective in transfering E1A gene for tumor suppression in a HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer model.",

This article reviews typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression, and patient age and menopausal status. In general, node-positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory breast cancer, although considered stage III, is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment.",

Candidate vaccines were tested in Her-2 transgenic (Tg) mice of BALB/c (BALB), BALB/cxC57BL/6 F1 (F1), or C57BL/6 (B6) background, which exhibit decreasing immune responsiveness to HER-2. Analysis of various cocktails or hybrid vaccines defined a requirement for particular combination of HER/2/Neu sequences to effectively prime immune effector cells in HER-2 Tg mice. In B6 HER-2 Tg mice, rejection of HER-2-positive tumors protected mice from HER-2-negative tumors, providing evidence of epitope spreading. Our findings show that a strategy of combining heterologous antigen with self-antigens could produce a potent DNA vaccine that may be applicable to other tumor-associated antigens.",

It is well known that HER-2/neu-positive cancers after treatment with trastuzumab can become HER-2/neu negative. Change in HER-2/neu status from negative to positive following treatment has not been well studied. We describe a patient with inflammatory breast cancer who was initially HER-2/neu negative but became positive after treatment. A 59-year-old postmenopausal white female saw her surgeon for violaceous discoloration of the left breast for 4 months. The surgeon palpated a mass measuring 6 cm in the patient's left breast. Additionally, there was violaceous discoloration involving two thirds of the breast. Biopsy of the breast mass and skin revealed inflammatory breast cancer. The tumor was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive and HER-2/neu negative. The patient was given four cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and docetaxol. She subsequently underwent a mastectomy, excision of the skin over the chest wall and axillary node dissection. Of the axillary lymph nodes, 14/14 were involved. The tumor was still estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive, but HER-2/neu was 2+ by immunohistochemistry and amplified at 3.3 as detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The patient received trastuzumab along with chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy and letrozole. She is currently receiving trastuzumab and letrozole in the adjuvant setting and appears to be doing well.;A breast cancer which was initially HER-2/neu negative can become positive following treatment. Therefore, re-biopsy may be necessary during the course of treatment of breast cancer to re-assess the HER-2/neu status. This gives the clinician the opportunity to include drugs like trastuzumab and lapatinib in the treatment of patients with a transformation to HER-2/neu-positive cancer.",

Interestingly, cyclin E over-expression has been associated with trastuzumab resistance. We studied cyclin E over-expression, CCNE1 amplification, and relapse-free survival in HER-2-positive primary breast cancers treated with and without trastuzumab therapy. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 202 HER-2-positive breast carcinomas were studied. Expression levels of cyclin E and proliferation marker Ki-67 were determined using immunohistochemistry. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) with a gene-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe was used to analyze presence of CCNE1 amplification. Majority of HER-2-positive breast carcinomas exhibited nuclear staining for cyclin E protein. Cyclin E was highly expressed (≥50 % cells) in 37 % of cases. Incidence of CCNE1 amplification (≥6 gene copies/cell or clusters) was 8 %. Cyclin E amplification and over-expression were strongly associated with each other, grade, hormone receptors, and Ki-67. Neither high cyclin E expression nor CCNE1 amplification was associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) irrespective of short-term (9-week regimen) adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. These results confirm cyclin E and HER-2 gene co-amplification in a fraction of HER-2-positive breast cancers.

To target breast cancer cells that overexpress HER-2/neu mRNA, we previously described a novel strategy that combines the principle of antisense (AS) and translational inhibitory activity conferred by an iron-responsive element (IRE) (AS-IRE). Here, we showed that three potential AS-IREs, i.e. AS-IRE1, 4, and 5, derived from HER-2/neu antisense sequence could bind endogenous iron regulatory protein (IRP) and, when placed in 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of a reporter gene, the gene expression could be translationally repressed by recombinant IRP in vitro. Using AS-IRE4 as our model, we demonstrated that it is regulated by iron, and importantly, such regulation is impaired in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we showed that AS-IRE4 could preferentially direct the expression of a reporter gene in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Interestingly, when AS-IRE4 was placed in 5'UTR of Bax gene, a pro-apoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 protein family, we observed a preferential cell killing in breast cancer cells that overexpress HER-2/neu.

Second, passive immune strategies with anti-HER-2 antibodies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, have led to survival benefits in breast cancer. Finally, the successes observed with novel immunotherapeutic strategies, such as immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell therapies in other malignancies, combined with a growing body of literature that supports an interplay between solid tumors and the immune system, indicate that these strategies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of breast cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in breast cancer strongly correlates with aggressive tumors and poor prognosis. Recently, a positive correlation between HER2 and MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, a tumor-promoting protein and heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) client) protein levels was shown in cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanistic link remained unknown. Here we show that overexpressed HER2 constitutively activates heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master transcriptional regulator of the inducible proteotoxic stress response of heat-shock chaperones, including HSP90, and a crucial factor in initiation and maintenance of the malignant state. Inhibiting HER2 pharmacologically by Lapatinib (a dual HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor) or CP724.714 (a specific HER2 inhibitor), or by knockdown via siRNA leads to inhibition of phosphoactivated Ser326 HSF1, and subsequently blocks the activity of the HSP90 chaperone machinery in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer lines. Consequently, HSP90 clients, including MIF, AKT, mutant p53 and HSF1 itself, become destabilized, which in turn inhibits tumor proliferation. Mechanistically, HER2 signals via the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT- mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis to induce activated pSer326 HSF1. Heat-shock stress experiments confirm this functional link between HER2 and HSF1, as HER2 (and PI3K) inhibition attenuate the HSF1-mediated heat-shock response. Importantly, we confirmed this axis in vivo. In the mouse model of HER2-driven breast cancer, ErbB2 inhibition by Lapatinib strongly suppresses tumor progression, and this is associated with inactivation of the HSF1 pathway. Moreover, ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cells derived from a primary mouse ErbB2 tumor also show HSF1 inactivation and HSP90 client destabilization in response to ErbB2 inhibition. Furthermore, in HER2-positive human breast cancers HER2 levels strongly correlate with pSer326 HSF1 activity. Our results show for the first time that HER2/ErbB2 overexpression controls HSF1 activity, with subsequent stabilization of numerous tumor-promoting HSP90 clients such as MIF, AKT and HSF1 itself, thereby causing a robust promotion in tumor growth in HER2-positive breast cancer.

In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment of different human breast cancer cell lines with honokiol resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent growth inhibition in both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cell lines, as well as in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines such as adriamycin-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. The inhibition of growth was associated with a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. The effects of honokiol might be reversely related to the expression level of human epidermal growth receptor 2, (HER-2, also known as erbB2, c-erbB2) since knockdown of her-2 expression by siRNA significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the her-2 over-expressed BT-474 cells to the honokiol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of HER-2 signalling by specific human epidermal growth receptor 1/HER-2 (EGFR/HER-2) kinase inhibitor lapatinib synergistically enhanced the anti-cancer effects of honokiol in her-2 over-expressed breast cancer cells. Finally, we showed that honokiol was able to attenuate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and upregulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten) expression. Combination of honokiol with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin presented synergistic effects on induction of apoptosis of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol, either alone or in combination with other therapeutics, could serve as a new, promising approach for breast cancer treatment.",

Overexpression of the COX-2 gene in mammary glands of transgenic mice was sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. We analyzed COX-2 expression in human breast cancers (and breast cancer cell lines) and adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as well as its association with HER2/neu and clinicopathological variables. Archival primary breast carcinomas (n = 57), adjacent DCIS (n = 14) and DCIS alone (n = 2) were analyzed for COX-2 and HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry using specific monoclonal antibodies. An immunohistochemical scoring system was used. HER2 gene amplification had been analyzed previously by fluorescence in situ hybridization (n = 20). Histology of carcinomas included infiltrating ductal (n = 44), lobular (n = 2), and other (n = 7). Frozen breast cancers and adjacent normal tissue pairs (n = 9) were analyzed for COX-2 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR. COX-2 and HER2 expression were also analyzed in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231) by immunoblotting. Cytoplasmic COX-2 expression was detected at an intermediate or high level in epithelial cells in 18 of 42 (43%) invasive breast cancers and in 10 of 16 (63%) cases of DCIS. Normal-appearing breast epithelia adjacent to cancer expressed COX-2 in 81% of cases and was generally focal and of similar or decreased intensity relative to adjacent neoplastic epithelia. COX-2 mRNA was detected in all samples analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and was increased in eight of nine breast cancers relative to paired normal tissue. In archival tumors, no significant correlation was found between COX-2 and HER2 expression/amplification and clinicopathological variables. COX-2 expression was induced in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with HER2, in contrast to parental MCF-7 cells, and was detected in MDA-MB-231, but not SK-BR-3 cells. COX-2 is frequently overexpressed in invasive breast cancers and in adjacent DCIS and, thus, may be an early event in mammary tumorigenesis. Forced HER2 expression in MCF-7 cells was shown to up-regulate COX-2, although no association was found in human tumors. Our results suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective COX-2 inhibitors may be useful in the chemoprevention and therapy of human breast cancer.",

In breast cancer patients, HER-2 overexpression correlates with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. HER-2, therefore, has become the focus of many anti-cancer therapeutic approaches. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of HER-2, was the first FDA-approved HER-2-targeted therapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However, not all HER-2-overexpressing patients respond to trastuzumab and most that initially respond develop resistance within one year of treatment. Trastuzumab resistance has been studied in cell line models of resistance and several mechanisms of resistance have been proposed. More recent anti-HER-2 strategies involve targeting its tyrosine kinase domain; for example, lapatinib (Tykerb) is a dual HER-2 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has shown efficacy as a single agent and in combination with other therapeutics. A number of novel HER-2 antagonists are currently in preclinical or clinical development, including both monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. Increased understanding of HER-2 signaling in breast cancer, and of response and resistance to HER-2 antagonists, will aid the development of strategies to overcome resistance to HER-2 targeted therapies.",

However, little is known about use of HER2 testing in real-world settings. This study examined uptake, use, appropriateness of HER2 testing, and the relationship between HER2 test results and treatment decisions.;We assessed electronic data from 3,634 patients with invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 1998 to 2007 in a large integrated health system. We collected data on patient and tumor characteristics, HER2 testing status, test results, and trastuzumab treatment.;From 1998 to 2000, the percent of patients who underwent HER2 evaluation increased from 12 to 94%; <3% of women with ductal carcinoma in situ, for whom HER2 testing is not recommended, were tested. Trastuzumab use increased 5-fold after 2004, when guidelines expanded to include recommending adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer in addition to metastatic treatment. Ninety-five percent of women receiving trastuzumab had a positive HER2 result. After 2004, 55% of women with invasive breast cancer and overexpression of HER2 received trastuzumab treatment; this ranged from 44% of women with localized breast cancer to 80% of women with distant metastatic disease.;These findings illustrate appropriate and effective implementation of a HER2 testing strategy in a managed care setting.",

The prognostic impact of HER2 positivity is lower in node-negative compared with node-positive women. The only significant, independent prognostic factors in breast cancer are node status, HER2 status and menopausal status. HER2-positive tumors also contain p53 abnormalities, tend to be hormone receptor and bcl-2 negative, have lymphoid infiltration (LI) and a high mitotic index. Patients with LI who are HER2 positive have a better prognosis than those who are HER2 negative, whereas HER2-positive patients without LI have a significantly worse prognosis than HER2-negative patients. Morphological and biological alterations appear to identify two categories of breast tumor. Two hypotheses may explain the progression to two tumor types: (1) atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is a precursor of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is a precursor of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC); or (2) ADH is a precursor of HER2-negative IDC whereas DCIS is a precursor of HER2-positive IDC. The second theory fits well with two breast cancer subsets and the characteristics of ADH and DCIS. The first type of IDC occurs in older patients, progresses slowly due to estrogen dependency but is aggressive long term.

In less than 10 years, trastuzumab became the standard of care in the adjuvant treatment of HER-2/neu positive breast cancer. In this setting, two combinations regimen with chemotherapy (concomitant or sequential) have been recently published. The concomitant schedule has been used in three studies (North American Group, BCIRG, FinHer), whereas in the Hera trial trastuzumab was started after the end of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. In this article, the advantages and uncertainties on efficacy and toxicities of the trastuzumab administration modalities, associated or not to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, are discussed.",

In multivariate analysis, erbB2 was the best prognosticator among postmenopausal N+ patients. Six out of seven N+ patients with erbB2 index 1.5 or above died including all postmenopausal patients. Bcl-2 positivity was associated with longer survival in the erbB2 positive patient group.;The most obvious patients for primary trastuzumab therapy in breast cancer are N+ patients with high erbB2 immunostaining index (> 1.5) and bcl-2 negative immunostaining.

Accordingly, this study was designed to investigate the possible differences in the biological characteristics of HER2(0) breast cancer and HER2(1+) breast cancer in TNBC.;Tissue specimens from 89 TNBC patients were immunohistochemically stained for CK5/6, EGFR, p53, Ki67, E-cadherin, TOP2A and Bcl-2.

In animal models, reduction of CXCR4 expression significantly abrogated metastatic disease and prolonged survival. In human breast cancers, CXCR4 overexpression may portend a worse clinical course. Recent data suggest that HER-2 up-regulates CXCR4, but whether this is applicable in the clinical setting is not known. In this study, we evaluated the role of CXCR4 overexpression in breast cancer and determined whether it can serve as a potential marker of tumor recurrence in HER-2 negative tumors.;One hundred three patients with stages I to III breast cancers and 6 benign breast tissues were prospectively accrued and analyzed. Study homogeneity was maintained by standardized treatment, surveillance, and compliance protocols. CXCR4 levels were detected using Western blots and results were quantified against 1 microg of HeLa cells (positive controls). HER-2 expression was evaluated using the Hercep program, (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) with a positive result defined as > or = 2. CXCR4 expression was defined as low (<6.6-fold) or high (> or = 6.6-fold). Primary endpoints were cancer recurrence and death. Statistical analysis performed included Spearman's correlation, independent samples t-test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and log-rank test.;All 103 cancer specimens had CXCR4 overexpression (mean 6.6 +/- 4.7), while none of the 6 benign breast tissues had detectable level of CXCR4. There were 36 HER-2 (+) tumors and 67 HER-2 (-) tumors. There was no statistical significance in mean CXCR4 overexpression between HER-2 (+) [5.6] and HER-2 (-) [6.6] cancers (P = 0.3; independent samples t-test). Recurrences occurred in 18 of 103 patients (17%); 10 occurred in HER-2 (+) tumors, and 8 occurred in HER-2 (-) patients. CXCR4 expression level was not predictive of cancer recurrence (P = 0.80) or overall survival (P = 0.70) in the HER-2 (+) group. However, among HER-2 negative tumors, 7 of 8 recurrences occurred in the high CXCR4 group (P = 0.037). There was no correlation between the degree of CXCR4 overexpression with tumor size (r = 0.13, P = 0.22), nodal status (r = 0.019, P = 0.4), ER/PR status (r = 0.12, P = 0.29), and HER-2 status (r = 0.091, P = 0.36).;CXCR4 overexpression was observed in all 103 breast cancer specimens but was undetectable in benign breast tissues. CXCR4 overexpression does not correlate with tumor size, nodal status, ER/PR status, and HER-2 status. High CXCR4 overexpression had a significant impact on disease-free survival in HER-2 negative breast cancer patients and may help identify a subset of HER-2 negative breast cancers that have a more aggressive biological behavior.",

An evaluation of the HER-2 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is performed on all invasive breast cancer cases. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is considered as the gold standard for the detection of HER-2 gene amplification for IHC equivocal cases (score 2+). A more recent in situ hybridization technique, the dual-color chromogenic in situ hybridization (dc-CISH), has been proposed as an alternative to FISH. The aim of this study was to measure the correlation between dc-CISH and FISH for HER-2 oncogene amplification assessment in invasive breast cancer.;We built four tissue micro-array (TMA) blocs with 100 breast invasive cancer cases that had been previously tested by IHC for HER-2 detection: 10 score 0 cases, 10 score 3+cases, 39 score 1+and 41 score 2+cases. Both FISH and dc-CISH techniques were applied on all TMA cases as well as on two additional slides serving as controls. Interpretation of dc-CISH was carried out by a pathologist using an optical microscope. For FISH, the interpretation was done by a professional from the medical genetics department using a fluorescent microscope linked to a computer system for image capturing and analysis. The interpretation of the HER-2/CEN-17 ratio for both tests was in accordance with the values of the updated recommendations from the Canadian National Consensus Meeting on HER-2/neu testing in breast cancer and from the ASCO/CAP. Among the 100 cases initially included in the study, eight were excluded from the analysis due to sampling or technical flaws. From the 92 remaining cases, we obtained a concordance of 97.8% (90/92 cases) between the two techniques (Kappa coefficient 0.97, 95% confidence interval). The correlation coefficient (rho) between ratios was estimated at 0.57.;This study shows a strong concordance between FISH and dc-CISH techniques and indicates that dc-CISH is a good alternative method for HER-2 gene amplification assessment in breast cancer.",

We have studied amplification and over-expression of HER-2/neu in 250 consecutive cases of breast cancer (220 invasive and 30 in situ carcinomas) presenting to the Department of Pathology at Women's College Campus of Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Center. Thirty percent of the invasive carcinomas were node positive. HER-2/neu protein over-expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IH) using antibody CB11 and amplification of the gene by differential PCR. The percentage of tumor cells showing CB11 staining was determined and the most significant cut off point for positivity was > or =10% moderate or strong complete membranous staining. The gene was considered amplified if the density score of the product was > or =2. There was 94% concordance between the two methods (P value.0001). Both methods were positive in 16% of cases and negative in 78% of cases. Discrepant cases were examined by FISH which confirmed the IH results in 9/11 invasive carcinomas. These results show that there is excellent concordance between IH and PCR.

Interactions were studied using mammary/breast cancer cell lines from wild-type rat c-neu gene transgenic mice and humans. Estradiol promoted cell proliferation and activated erbB2/neu tyrosine kinase, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling exclusively in mammary and breast epithelial cell lines with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3. Estradiol action was independent of the transgene promoter (MMTV-LTR) activity, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as c-neu transgene or endogenous erbB2 gene expression. Estrogen induction of cell growth promotion, erbB2/neu activation, and downstream signaling was abrogated by blockade of estrogen receptor (ER) with the pure ER antagonist ICI 182,780 or knockdown of erbB3 expression via specific siRNA.

The correlation study of LDP binding capability to human breast tumor tissues and relevant therapeutic targets was performed on breast cancer tissue microarrays. Immunocytochemical examination was used to detect the binding capability of LDP to human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. As a result, tissue microarray showed that LDP staining of 73.2% (30/41) of breast cancer tissues was positive, whereas that of 48.3% (15/31) of the adjacent normal breast specimens was positive. The difference between the tumor and normal samples was significant (Chi2 = 4.63, P < 0.05).

The guidelines for testing of surgical specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC) are well defined, whereas they are lacking for cytological samples. We evaluated various fixation protocols for optimal receptor testing by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry (ICC) of human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (ER/PR positive) and SKBR-3 (overexpressing HER-2). The cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin or Saccomanno Fixative (SF) for various time points, and either embedded in paraffin as cell blocks or prepared as cytospins. ER and PR slides were assigned a proportion score (PS; 0-5), an intensity score (IS; 0-3) and a total score (TS = PS + IS). Standard DAKO scoring system ranging from 0 to 3+ was used for the evaluation of HER-2 staining. Human breast cancer cells stained successfully for ER, PR and HER-2 when fixed in formalin and prepared as cell blocks. The optimal fixation time for formalin-fixed cells ranged from 2 to 96 hours. Cells fixed in SF from 2 to 96 hours also stained well for ER and PR. However, SF produced variable results for HER-2 staining; particularly, SF fixation beyond 24 hours caused false negative results. The interpretation of HER-2 staining on cytospins was not feasible irrespective of the fixative and fixation time. In summary, formalin fixation from 2 to 96 hours and preparation of cells as cell blocks produces optimal results for ER, PR, and HER-2 testing in human breast cancer cells.",

Although the survival of patients with IBC has been greatly improved by the use of combined treatment modalities, women with IBC still have lower survival rates. We have summarized a single-center experience involving IBC patients. Our objectives are to clarify molecular alterations of HER-2/neu and p53 in IBC and to investigate the prognostic factors.;Between January 1990 and December 2000, 57 patients with IBC were referred to the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. The incidence of IBC among primary breast cancers was 1.0% (57/5,757) in our hospital. Forty-six patients meeting Haagensen's criteria for inflammatory breast carcinoma were evaluated. All patients had biopsy-proven carcinomas but no distant metastases at referral. The median age at diagnosis for IBC was 51.8 (range, 28 to 70). All patients underwent a mastectomy. Chemotherapy was performed pre- or post-operatively. Three-year and 5-year survival rates were 56.5%, and 40.7%, respectively. Expressions of HER-2/neu and the p53 protein were determined retrospectively by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of thin paraffin-embedded sections of primary tumors.;Of 46 patients, 23 (50.0%) with tumors testing positive for HER-2/neu fared somewhat worse than those with negative tumors, but the differences were not significant for either overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS). Of 46 patients, 19 (41.3%) whose tumors were positive for p53 fared somewhat better than patients with negative tumors, with no significant differences in either OS or DFS. Patients presenting with less than ten pathologically involved axillary lymph nodes showed significantly better OS and DFS.;Overexpression of HER-2/neu and the p53 protein were not significant prognostic factors in inflammatory breast cancer. However, the increased incidence of HER-2/neu and the poor outcome of IBC may be of clinical interest, suggesting the need for clinical trials of antibody therapy targeted to HER-2/neu. Moreover, a high prevalence of p53 may be useful in determining the specific use of chemotherapy.",

In a study designed to identify genes up-regulated in breast cancer, a cDNA clone corresponding to a novel gene C35 (C17orf37) was selected by representational difference analysis of tumor and normal human mammary cell lines. Abundant expression of C35 transcript in tumors was confirmed by Northern blot and real-time PCR. The C35 gene is located on chromosome 17q12, 505 nucleotides from the 3' end of the ERBB2 oncogene, the antigenic target for trastuzumab (Herceptin) therapy. The chromosomal arrangement of the genes encoding C35 and ERBB2 is tail to tail. An open reading frame encodes a 12-kDa protein of unknown function. Immunohistochemical analysis detected robust and frequent expression of C35 protein, including 32% of grade 1 and 66% of grades 2 and 3 infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast (in contrast to 20% overexpressing HER-2/neu), 38% of infiltrating lobular carcinoma (typically HER-2/neu negative), as well as tumors arising in other tissues. C35 was not detected in 38 different normal human tissues, except Leydig cells in the testes and trace levels in a small percentage of normal breast tissue samples. The distinct and favorable expression profile of C35 spanning early through late stages of disease, including high frequency of overexpression in various breast carcinoma, abundant expression in distant metastases, and either absence or low level expression in normal human tissues, warrants further investigation of the relevance of C35 as a biomarker and/or a target for development of broadly applicable cancer-specific therapies.",

Thus, differentiating a primary cutaneous process from a metastatic breast carcinoma can be nearly impossible. In all, 10-34% of breast carcinomas overexpress HER-2 protein, a membrane-associated protein that functions in cell differentiation, adhesion and motility. As expression of this gene in cutaneous neoplasms has not been well characterized, we sought to determine HER-2 expression in a sample of benign and malignant cutaneous eccrine and apocrine neoplasms and to determine if there is value in using this protein expression in differentiating primary cutaneous from metastatic breast lesions. Totally, 85 primary cutaneous neoplasms and 11 cutaneous metastases from HER-2-positive breast carcinomas were retrieved from archived material at our institute. All cases were evaluated for HER-2 protein expression using the Dako Hercept Test kit. Membranous HER-2 staining was noted in three of the 85 cutaneous adnexal neoplasms: one hidrocystoma and two nodular hidradenomas. Seven of the 11 cutaneous metastases from HER-2-positive breast carcinomas maintained moderate-to-strong HER-2 expression. In conclusion, while 10-34% of breast carcinomas overexpress the HER-2 protein, only 3.5% of cutaneous apocrine and eccrine neoplasms in this study stained with the HER-2 antibody. These HER-2-positive cutaneous neoplasms typically do not pose a diagnostic dilemma in the setting of differentiation from breast metastasis. Additionally, although histologically these breast and cutaneous lesions may have morphologic similarities, the relative lack of HER-2 overexpression suggests that they are different nosologically. Finally, this study suggests that HER-2 protein expression can be a useful tool in differentiating a primary cutaneous appendageal neoplasm from HER-2 expressing metastatic breast carcinoma.",

Lobulitis was found in 26 (8%) of 334 patients. The lymphocytic infiltrate was predominantly T-cell type. In a multivariate model, lobulitis in patients with breast cancer was significantly associated with younger age, triple (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2)-negative cancers, and medullary phenotypes.

Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) was used to identify significant copy number alterations (CNAs) in HER2+ tumors, which were related to a set of 554 non-HER2 amplified (HER2-) breast tumors. High-resolution oligonucleotide aCGH was used to delineate the 17q12-q21 region in high detail.;The HER2-amplicon was narrowed to an 85.92 kbp region including the TCAP, PNMT, PERLD1, HER2, C17orf37 and GRB7 genes, and higher HER2 copy numbers indicated worse prognosis. In 31% of HER2+ tumors the amplicon extended to TOP2A, defining a subgroup of HER2+ breast cancer associated with estrogen receptor-positive status and with a trend of better survival than HER2+ breast cancers with deleted (18%) or neutral TOP2A (51%). HER2+ tumors were clearly distinguished from HER2- tumors by the presence of recurrent high-level amplifications and firestorm patterns on chromosome 17q. While there was no significant difference between HER2+ and HER2- tumors regarding the incidence of other recurrent high-level amplifications, differences in the co-amplification pattern were observed, as shown by the almost mutually exclusive occurrence of 8p12, 11q13 and 20q13 amplification in HER2+ tumors. GISTIC analysis identified 117 significant CNAs across all autosomes. Supervised analyses revealed: (1) significant CNAs separating HER2+ tumors stratified by clinical variables, and (2) CNAs separating HER2+ from HER2- tumors.;We have performed a comprehensive survey of CNAs in HER2+ breast tumors, pinpointing significant genomic alterations including both known and potentially novel therapeutic targets.

We demonstrate here that ErbB2-overexpressing breast carcinomas acquire the H3K4me3 mark on the erbB2 promoter and that receptor-amplified tumors further acquire the H3K9ac mark, which is dependent on H3K4me3 mark acquisition. Targeting WD repeat domain 5 (Wdr5), which is absolutely required for H3K4me3 enrichment, decreased ErbB2 overexpression, associated with a decrease in the H3K4me3 mark on the erbB2 promoter.

Serum HER2, MMP-9, and carcinoma antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) were assessed in 80 breast cancer patients and ten healthy subjects as a control group by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique while NO and TAC were assessed by a colorimetric method. Serum HER2 was ≥15 ng/mL in nine patients (11.3%). High HER2 ECD levels were significantly associated with tissue HER2 (P<0.0001), metastasis (P= 0.0024), and negativity of both estrogen (P=0.0075) and progesterone (P=0.0239) receptors.

Serum MMP-9 was increased significantly (P=0.028) in metastatic patients as compared to non-metastatic patients. We found a positive correlation between serum HER2 and CA 15-3 (r=36, p=0.005). In conclusion, serum HER2 reflects the tissue HER2 status of breast cancer, so the determination of serum HER2 is helpful in assessing HER2 status, but in addition, a high level may reflect metastatic disease.

A need exists to identify the underlying biological subsets of morphologically similar carcinomas in order to develop customized therapies for patients who require chemotherapy. The HER-2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in 15-30% of breast carcinomas, and is associated with a worse prognosis stage-for-stage. Humanized monoclonal antibody therapy (Herceptin; Genentech Co.) appears to benefit this subset of patients by improving their response rate and survival following anthracycline- or taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimens. Both HER-2 gene amplification and protein overexpression correlate with clinical outcomes, and screening for HER-2 gene amplification appears to be the more informative test.

The effects of IGF-1R expression on the survival rates and outcomes of breast cancer were also examined.;IGF-1R expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tissue microarray blocks constructed from 1,198 invasive breast cancer samples collected from six medical institutions. IGF-1R expression was interpreted according to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu immunohistochemistry scoring system. Scores of 2+ and 3+ were considered positive.;Positive IGF-1R expression was observed in 65.4% of invasive breast cancer samples. IGF-1R expression was detected in all cancer subtypes (luminal A, 84.4%; luminal B, 75.9%; HER2, 21.2%; triple-negative, 46.6%) and was found to be associated with a positive hormone receptor status and the absence of HER2 amplification (p<0.001). Positive IGF-1R expression was significantly associated with high survival rates (p=0.014). However, a multivariate analysis revealed that the expression levels of IGF-1R did not achieve statistical significance. In the triple-negative cancer subtype, IGF-1R expression was found to be associated with a lower disease-free survival rate (p=0.031).;Positive IGF-1R expression is associated with a favorable prognosis in breast cancer. IGF-1R is frequently expressed in the luminal A/B subtypes of breast cancer, and its expression is related to the hormone receptor status.",

Immunoprevention of viral tumors is already implemented at the population level for human hepatocellular and cervical carcinomas. Altogether, viral vaccines could prevent more than 10% of all human tumors. The big question is whether immunoprevention can be applied to nonviral tumors, including breast cancer. Promising results were obtained in preclinical models, in particular in HER-2/neu transgenic mice, which are prone to mammary carcinoma development, using vaccines against HER-2/neu oncoprotein p185. The life expectancy of vaccinated mice was more than doubled. Protective immune mechanisms elicited by effective vaccines were mainly based on helper T cell cytokines, in particular γ-interferon, and anti-p185 antibodies. The term \"oncoantigens\" was coined to define those antigenic molecules that, like HER-2, are indispensable for tumor growth, thus representing the best class of targets for cancer immunoprevention. The study of immunopreventive vaccines against subsequent phases of neoplastic progression showed a dramatic loss of efficacy against established mammary carcinomas, whereas the prevention of micrometastasis growth was successful. Preclinical results provide useful indications for the translation of cancer immunoprevention to humans, and useful hints for cancer immunotherapy.",

The comparison between FISH and IHC assays demonstrates a considerably high degree of concordance (around 90%). When dealing with cases scored as 3+ (according to the FDA licensed scoring method), such a concordance approaches 100%.

However, the precise distribution of poor prognostic features in this population remains unclear. We examined the pathologic features and distribution of molecular phenotype in relation to patient age in a large group of young women (≤40 years) with invasive breast cancer. Medical records were reviewed for clinical characteristics, tumor stage, and receptor status. Pathologic features, including those features associated with basal-like carcinomas, were examined by central review. Using tumor grade and biomarker expression, cancers were categorized as luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2-, histologic grade 1 or 2); luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2+, or ER and/or PR+, HER2- and grade 3); HER2 (ER and PR- and HER2+); and triple negative (ER-, PR-, and HER2-). Among 399 women of ≤40 years, 33% had luminal A tumors, 35% luminal B, 11% HER2 (ER-negative), and 21% triple negative. Compared to published results for all breast cancers, a greater proportion of young women had luminal B tumors, and a lesser proportion had luminal A. There were no significant differences in molecular phenotype, tumor stage or grade among the different age groups of young women.

This analysis identified several potential shortcomings of the various methods used to evaluate HER-2/neu in these diseases (Southern, Northern, and Western blots, and immunohistochemistry) and provided information regarding considerations that should be addressed when studying a gene or gene product in human tissue.

ErbB2-positive breast cancer is tend to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer and therefore further investigation on the signaling pathways of erbB2 is needed for the therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment. Here we report that microRNA-205 (miR-205), a molecule also reported to be associated with breast cancer, is negatively regulated by erbB2 overexpression. Breast epithelial cells exogenously overexpressed with erbB2 decreased the expression of miR-205, whereas increased the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). The decreased expression of miR-205 slightly increased by the transfection of erbB2 siRNA into the erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer epithelial cells. Overexpression of erbB2 enabled breast epithelial cells to grow anchorage-independently in soft agar, and the transfection of the precursor of miR-205 into the cells leaded to the decrease in the ability to grow in soft agar. These results suggest that down-regulation of miR-205 in erbB2-overexpressing breast epithelial cells is essential for erbB2-induced tumorigenesis, and miR-205 may have the potential to be a novel important alternative therapeutic target for erbB2-positive breast cancer.",

To circumvent this problem, we conjugated the NH2 groups of Trastuzumab with biotin, and the compound obtained, designated BiotHER, was added directly to tissue sections. Biotin-labelling was revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Specificity and sensitivity of BiotHER immunostaining with respect to HER-2 amplification were tested on 164 breast carcinoma samples. BiotHER staining was detected on the tumour cell membrane of 12% of all specimens and in 49% specimens with gene amplification, while absent in nonamplified tumours. Predictivity of BiotHER status with respect to the clinical outcome was analysed in 54 patients with HER-2 amplified advanced breast cancer treated with Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. BiotHER staining, detected in 50% of tumours with HER-2 amplification, was an independent predictor of clinical outcome. In fact, BiotHER positivity was independently associated with increased likelihood of tumour response and reduced risk of tumour progression and death.

Determination of HER-2 tumor status offers clinically useful information, as it selects patients who may benefit from treatment with trastuzumab, the monoclonal antibody against HER-2. Currently approved methods for HER-2 testing include immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization using tumor tissue. A fragment of HER-2 composed of its extracellular domain (ECD) can also be detected in the serum of some patients with breast cancer. As an easily accessible tumor marker, it could offer additional useful prognostic or predictive information. This review will briefly address the biology of the circulating HER-2 ECD and discuss the evidence to support the role, if any, for measuring HER-2 ECD levels in women with breast cancer. In particular, we focus on the value and limitations of serum ECD in both early and advanced breast cancer in the following clinical contexts: as a marker of HER-2 tumor tissue status; clinical implications of raised levels in women who have a tumor not overexpressing HER-2; as a prognostic indicator and as a predictor of response to treatment; and as a monitoring tool for early recurrence. On the basis of our review of the literature, we conclude that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of serum HER-2 ECD in the routine management of individual patients with breast cancer.

The effectiveness of CISH in detecting the Her-2/neu oncogene in cytologic specimens has not been well documented. Twenty-five cases of fine needle aspirate smears and touch imprints from infiltrating ductal carcinomas were examined. Both CISH and FISH were performed on each case using a digoxigenin-labeled Her-2 DNA probe for CISH (Zymed) and both Her-2 and chromosome 17 probes for FISH (Vysis). Sixty tumor cells were evaluated in each case. The scoring system and interpretation of CISH were as follows: (1) no amplification (<5 brown dots/nucleus), (2) amplification (>10 brown dots/nucleus), and (3) low-level amplification (5-9 brown dots/nucleus). Of the 25 cases analyzed, 23 (3 amplified and 20 nonamplified) showed similar results for both methods. Two cases were discordant. In these cases, low-level amplification was suggested by CISH but nonamplification by FISH. One of the cases can be explained by polysomy for chromosome 17 by FISH.

Using the HER-2/neu oncogenic protein as a model, a well-defined tumor antigen in breast cancer, we questioned whether patients with advanced stage HER-2/neu overexpressing breast and ovarian cancers (III/IV) had evidence of pre-existent immunity to HER-2/neu. Forty-five patients with stage III or IV HER-2/neu overexpressing breast or ovarian cancer were evaluated for HER-2/neu specific T cell and antibody immunity. Patients enrolled had not received immunosuppressive chemotherapy for at least 30 days (median 5 months, range 1-75 months). All patients were documented to be immune competent prior to entry by DTH testing using a skin test anergy battery. Five of 45 patients (11%) were found to have a significant HER-2/neu specific T cell response as defined by a stimulation index > or = 2.0 (range 2.0-7.9).

We conducted immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for HER2 in breast cancer cell blocks (CBs) and compared the results with those from the corresponding histological specimens. In cases of discrepancy between the two types of specimen, the bright-field HER2 dual in situ hybridization (DISH) assay was performed.;CBs were prepared from 54 surgically excised breast cancers. The cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. A Ventana BenchMark ULTRA (Roche Diagnostics) with anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) rabbit monoclonal primary antibody and INFORM HER2/neu Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail was used for the assays.;Successful results were obtained in 52 of 54 CBs. Forty cases showed agreement between CBs and the histological specimens. No discrepancy was observed between the two types of specimens in cases where HER2 expression was positive. IHC results of CB in 12 discrepant cases were HER2 intermediate or negative. The DISH results of 11 of these cases were negative.;IHC staining of HER2 for breast cancer CBs can be used in the same way as that used for histological specimens, although the number of equivocal cases in CBs is greater than that in histological specimens.

We performed immunohistochemical staining of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth receptor-2 (HER-2) and Ki-67 and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for HER-2 on the TMA sections and divided breast cancers into molecular subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Then, we examined YAP and pYAP expression status using immunohistochemical analysis according to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We found that HER-2 type breast cancer demonstrated elevated expression level in tumoral cytoplasmic YAP (P = 0.011) and pYAP (P = 0.049). Expressions of stromal YAP (P = 0.002) and pYAP (P < 0.001) were higher in luminal B and HER-2 type breast cancer but lower in TNBC. In univariate analysis, nuclear YAP expression of tumor cells was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.024). Cytoplasmic YAP expression of HER-2 type breast cancer cells negatively affected disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.034). In conclusion, we concluded that there was a significant difference in YAP and pYAP expression status according to molecular subtypes and tumoral and cellular components of breast cancers. Finally, we found that nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP expression could be a prognostic marker for breast cancer patients. ",

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of an antibody against the rat variant of HER-2/neu, labeled with the alpha-particle emitter (213)Bi to treat widespread metastases in a rat/neu transgenic mouse model of metastatic mammary carcinoma. The model manifests wide-spread dissemination of tumor cells leading to osteolytic bone lesions and liver metastases, common sites of clinical metastases. The maximum tolerated dose was 120 muCi of (213)Bi-7.16.4. The kinetics of marrow suppression and subsequent recovery were determined. Three days after left cardiac ventricular injection of 10(5) rat HER-2/neu--expressing syngeneic tumor cells, neu-N mice were treated with (a) 120 muCi (213)Bi-7.16.4, (b) 90 muCi (213)Bi-7.16.4, (c) 120 muCi (213)Bi-Rituximab (unreactive control), and (d) unlabeled 7.16.4. Treatment with 120 muCi (213)Bi-7.16.4 increased median survival time to 41 days compared with 28 days for the untreated controls (P < 0.0001); corresponding median survival times for groups b, c, and d were 36 (P < 0.001), 31 (P < 0.01), and 33 (P = 0.05) days, respectively. Median survival relative to controls was not significantly improved in mice injected with 10-fold less cells or with multiple courses of treatment. We concluded that alpha-emitter (213)Bi-labeled monoclonal antibody targeting the HER-2/neu antigen was effective in treating early-stage HER-2/neu--expressing micrometastases. Analysis of the results suggests that further gains in efficacy may require higher specific activity constructs or target antigens that are more highly expressed on tumor cells.",

However, its relevance to the progression of human breast cancer is yet to be established. Furthermore, it is not clear whether MMP-13 can be used as an independent breast cancer biomarker. This study was conducted to assess the expression profile of MMP-13 protein in invasive breast carcinomas to determine its diagnostic and prognostic significance, as well as its correlation with other biomarkers including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Her-2/neu, MMP-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 and -2 (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2).;Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue microarray containing specimens from 263 breast carcinomas. The intensity and the extent of IHC were scored by pathologists in blind fashion. The correlation of the gene expression profiles with patients' clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes were analyzed for statistical significance.;MMP-13 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of the malignant cells and the peritumoral stromal cells. MMP-13 expression by tumor cells (p < 0.001) and stromal fibroblasts (p <0.001) both correlated with carcinoma infiltration of lymph nodes. MMP-13 also correlated with the expression of Her-2/neu (p = 0.015) and TIMP-1 (p < 0.010), respectively in tumor cells. Tumor-derived, but not stromal fibroblast-derived, MMP-13 correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes. Moreover, high levels of MMP-13 expression were associated with decreased overall survival. In parallel, the prognostic value of MMP-13 expressed by peritumoral fibroblasts seems less significant. Our data suggest that lymph node status, tumor size, Her-2/neu expression, TIMP-1 and MMP-13 expression in cancer cells are independent prognostic factors.;Tumor-derived, but not stromal fibroblast-derived, MMP-13 correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, and inversely correlated with the overall survival of breast cancer patients. MMP-13 may serve as an independent prognostic factor for invasive breast cancer patients. MMP-13 may be particularly useful as a prognostic marker when evaluated along with Her-2/neu and lymph node status.",

This Annual Report includes a focus on breast cancer incidence by subtype using new, national-level data.;Population-based cancer trends and breast cancer incidence by molecular subtype were calculated. Breast cancer subtypes were classified using tumor biomarkers for hormone receptor (HR) and human growth factor-neu receptor (HER2) expression.;Overall cancer incidence decreased for men by 1.8% annually from 2007 to 2011 [corrected]. Rates for women were stable from 1998 to 2011. Within these trends there was racial/ethnic variation, and some sites have increasing rates. Among children, incidence rates continued to increase by 0.8% per year over the past decade while, like adults, mortality declined. HR+/HER2- breast cancers, the subtype with the best prognosis, were the most common for all races/ethnicities with highest rates among non-Hispanic white women, local stage cases, and low poverty areas (92.7, 63.51, and 98.69 per 100000 non-Hispanic white women, respectively). HR+/HER2- breast cancer incidence rates were strongly, positively correlated with mammography use, particularly for non-Hispanic white women (Pearson 0.57, two-sided P < .001). Triple-negative breast cancers, the subtype with the worst prognosis, were highest among non-Hispanic black women (27.2 per 100000 non-Hispanic black women), which is reflected in high rates in southeastern states.;Progress continues in reducing the burden of cancer in the United States. There are unique racial/ethnic-specific incidence patterns for breast cancer subtypes; likely because of both biologic and social risk factors, including variation in mammography use. Breast cancer subtype analysis confirms the capacity of cancer registries to adjust national collection standards to produce clinically relevant data based on evolving medical knowledge.",

HER-2/neu protein overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in several subsets of patients. The protein may also be related to cancer formation, with overexpression being detectable in 50-60% of ductal carcinomas in situ. It has been suggested that it might be possible to develop specific T-cell therapy directed against proteins involved in malignant transformation. One question is whether normal proteins that are overexpressed are appropriate targets for therapeutic immune attack. This report demonstrates that some patients with HER-2/neu-positive breast cancers have both existent CD4+ helper/inducer T-cell immunity and antibody-mediated immunity to HER-2/neu protein. Initial studies performed on 20 premenopausal breast cancer patients identified antibodies to HER-2/neu in 11 individuals. Similar antibody responses have been found in some normal individuals. The patient with the greatest antibody response was studied in detail. In addition to a humoral immune response this patient had evidence of a significant proliferative T-cell response to the HER-2/neu protein and peptides. Similar T-cell responses have been detected in additional patients. It has been assumed that patients would be immunologically tolerant to HER-2/neu as a self-protein and that immunity might be difficult to generate. If immunity could be generated, the result might be destructive autoimmunity. The current data support the notion that HER-2/neu-specific immunity might be used in therapy without destroying normal tissue but also raises questions as to the role of existent immunity in immune surveillance and cancer progression.",

Of these, 65 patients with 71 BCs had complete pathologic information. The median age at HL diagnosis was 23 (range, 10-48). The median age at BC diagnosis was 44 (range, 28-66). The median time to developing BC was 20 years. Twenty cancers (28%) were DCIS and 51 (72%) were invasive. Of the 51 invasive cancers, 24 (47%) were HR+/HER2-, 2 (4%) were HR+/HER2+, 5 (10%) were HR-/HER2+, and 20 (39%) were HR-/HER2-. There were no differences in BC histologic subtype according to the age at which patients were exposed to RT, the use of chemotherapy for HL treatment, or the time from RT exposure to the development of BC. In a 4 : 1 age-matched comparison to sporadic BCs, BCs after HL were more likely to be HR-/HER2- (39% versus 14%) and less likely to be HR+/HER2- (47% versus 61%) or HR+/HER2+ (4% versus 14%) (P = 0.0003).;BCs arising in previously irradiated breast tissue were more likely to be triple negative compared with age-matched sporadic invasive cancers and less likely to be HR positive. Further studies will be important to determine the molecular pathways of carcinogenesis in breast tissue that is exposed to RT.",

Two-color FISH (PathVysion) CISH of 17 centromere was done if the observer considered it necessary to ascertain amplification status in tumors with borderline HER-2 CISH copy numbers.;Paired CISH/FISH results were available from 192 (97%) of 197 cases, no clear difference in success rates of either method was observed. Centromere 17 CISH was considered necessary in seven tumors. CISH and two-color FISH results were concordant in 180 cases (93.8%). There were 92 and 88 tumors found HER-2 amplified and nonamplified, respectively, by both methods. Eight tumors were amplified by CISH but not by FISH, and four tumors exhibited the opposite condition (kappa coefficient 0.875). In 7 of 12 cases differences between the two methods could have related to a lack of CISH chromosome 17 information. The remaining cases were explained by difficult histology (ductal carcinoma in situ, poor representativity, dense lymphocytic infiltration, or intratumoral heterogeneity).;These results indicate that CISH could provide an accurate and practical alternative to FISH for clinical diagnosis of HER-2/neu oncogene amplification in archival formalin-fixed breast cancer samples.",

Polymorphisms of TNF-α have been associated with cancer. We examined the role of the -308G>A polymorphism in this gene by comparing the genotypes of 294 healthy Mexican women with those of 465 Mexican women with breast cancer. The observed genotype frequencies for controls and breast cancer patients were 1 and 14% for AA, 13 and 21% for GA, and 86 and 65% for GG, respectively. We found that the odds ratio (OR) for AA genotype was 2.4, with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of 5.9-101.1 (P = 0.0001).

The mechanisms of action of trastuzumab involve several pathways including Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Because human γδ T lymphocytes mediate Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and can be activated further by phosphoantigens, these cells are prone to improve the efficacy of Abs, as recently demonstrated for CD20(+) B cell lymphomas. Whether this concept applies as well with carcinomas remained to be demonstrated in vivo, however. In this study, we asked whether a combination of trastuzumab and phosphoantigen-stimulated γδ lymphocytes increases the efficacy of trastuzumab against HER-2(+) breast carcinoma cell lines in vivo. We report that repeated infusions of this combination had a better efficacy than that of trastuzumab alone against HER-2(+) mammary carcinoma xenografts in mice. In these models, reduction of tumor growth was observed together with trastuzumab opsonization of HER-2(+) cells and tumor infiltration by γδ lymphocytes. In addition in humans, the mammary carcinomas of 27 of 30 patients showed significant γδ T cell infiltrates. Altogether, these findings indicate that combination of trastuzumab and stimulated γδ cells represents a new strategy to improve the efficacy of Herceptin (trastuzumab) in HER-2(+) breast cancer.",

Basaloid type was more likely to be found in younger patients frequently with a family history of breast cancer. HER-2 type usually had a tumor of larger size with more advanced stage disease and more metastatic lymph nodes. Luminal type was likely to occur in aged patients with an earlier stage disease. The recurrence rates in basaloid, HER-2 and luminal types were 25.0%, 27.9% and 11.7%, respectively. Patients with basaloid or HER-2 type were found to have a significantly higher recurrence rate than the patients with luminal type breast cancer (P < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between the basaloid and HER-2 types. However, patients with basaloid type breast cancer were more likely to develop lung metastasis than HER-2 type (13.4% vs. 7.1%, P = 0.017). Up to December 2006, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates for patients with basaloid, HER-2 and luminal types were 72.2%, 68.2% and 86.2% (P < 0.001), respectively.

The biomarkers may be used as indices in clinical trials aiming to assess the effect of weight reduction, dietary intervention or hormone replacement therapy on the risk of progression to invasive breast cancer. In the current state of knowledge, the expression of oestrogen receptors, p53, bcl-2 and HER-2 neu oncogenes and the Ki-67 index of proliferative activity, are the most useful biomarkers for this purpose. In situ carcinoma of the breast manifests a variety of morphological phenotypes with specific biological characteristics. There is evidence that only a proportion of premalignant lesions are committed to progression to invasive cancer while other lesions undergo spontaneous regression at the time of the menopause. Cross-cultural studies suggest that it is the late-stage epigenetic promoting factors which are responsible for the high incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer in Western women. Obesity in middle life and the Western diet favour the development of hyperinsulinaemic insulin resistance, and the metabolic-endocrine effects of its concomitants may promote mammary carcinogenesis around the time of the menopause and increase the incidence of invasive cancer after the menopause. Because biomarker changes in premalignant lesions are nearer in time to these promoting influences, they could provide intermediate endpoints for testing the hypothesis.",

Comparing HER-2/neu immunohistochemistry of primary tumours and distant metastases case by case, increased HER-2/neu expression was found in the distant metastases in 15 cases (48.4%), three (9.7%) of which showed an increase from score 0 to score 3+. In contrast, lymph node metastases showed the same HER-2/neu expression as the primary tumours, confirmed by FISH. Two cases, which showed HER-2/neu score 3+ and HER-2/neu amplification in the primary tumours, revealed increased SHER-2 levels above 50 ng/ml at the first measurement. Five of the 14 cases (36%) showed an increase of SHER-2 above 50 ng/ml towards the end of the patients' life. On the basis of these results, there is evidence that in a subset of breast carcinomas, HER-2/neu amplification and overexpression occur de novo in distant metastases at a late disease stage.",

GRB-7 is amplified concurrently with HER-2/Neu in most, if not all, of breast cancer with chromosome 17q11-21 amplification. GRB-7 gene amplification is associated with RNA over-expression. We show GRB-7 protein is over-expressed by immunoblotting in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors with HER-2/Neu protein over-expression. Over-expression of GRB-7 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that over-express HER-2/Neu leads to activation of tyrosine phosphorylation of HER-2/Neu. Knockdown of GRB-7 expression in SKBR-3 breast cancer cells with naturally occurring HER-2/Neu gene amplification decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of HER-2/Neu. Activation of HER-2/Neu phosphorylation is associated with increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-specific lipase C-gamma-1 (PLC-gamma-1) and recruitment of PLC-gamma-1 to HER-2/Neu protein molecule. Activation of downstream protein kinase C (PKC) pathway is evidenced by increase in the phosphorylation of a common PKC substrate-myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS). In addition, over-expression of GRB-7 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that over-express HER-2/Neu leads to activation of AKT phosphorylation. Knockdown of GRB-7 expression in MB-453 and SKBR-3 breast cancer cells results in decrease in AKT phosphorylation. GRB-7 over-expression therefore facilitates activation of phosphorylation of HER-2/Neu and AKT in breast cancer cells with HER-2/Neu over-expression. GRB-7 over-expression in MCF-7 cells over-expressing HER-2/Neu leads to morphologic change of cells and promotes tumor xenograft growth in nude mice. GRB-7 over-expression therefore plays pivotal roles in activating signal transduction and promoting tumor growth in breast cancer cells with chromosome 17q11-21 amplification.",

To explain the pathogenesis of this disease, the immunohistochemical characteristics of these cells were investigated in 25 patients. The cytoplasmic presence of low molecular weight cytokeratin and the absence of high molecular weight cytokeratin in all cases confirmed the glandular origin of the Paget cells. Membrane over-expression of the neu-protein was established in 96% of cases. It was hypothesized that epidermal keratinocytes release a chemotactic factor which attracts neu-over-expressing breast carcinoma cells by chemotaxis into the epidermis. The biological assays showed that normal keratinocytes release one or more chemotactic factor(s) into their conditioned medium, which induced spreading and motility of neu-over-expressing SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells. The conditioned medium of keratinocytes also attracted the SK-BR-3 cells by chemotaxis in a modified Boyden chamber. Furthermore, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which do not over-express the neu-protein, were not attracted by chemotaxis of conditioned medium of human keratinocytes. The involvement of the neu-protein in spreading, motility and chemotaxis is further indicated by the inhibition of these processes by monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of the neu-protein. We conclude, therefore, that the Paget cells spread through the epidermis due to the motility induced by a chemotactic factor, which is released by epidermal keratinocytes and whose influence is mediated by the neu-protein.",

A total of 144 women diagnosed with cancers in contralateral breasts were identified from the Henry Ford Health System tumor registry. Data were retrieved from electronic databases and medical records. Women were dichotomized into users and nonusers of tamoxifen. Hormone receptors were scored as positive or negative. HER-2/neu overexpression, assessed by immunohistochemistry, was scored as 0, 1(+), 2(+), or 3(+). Concordance between hormone receptors of the two cancers was low (kappa = 0.27, p = 0.06). Stratification of women by tamoxifen therapy yielded an almost fivefold increase in the proportion of estrogen receptor-negative cancers among the users, while the proportion of cancers expressing no estrogen receptor remained the same among the nonusers (39.6% versus 40.6%). Matched, archived, paraffin-embedded specimens of the first and contralateral breast cancers were available for 57 women. The correlation between the relative overexpression of HER-2/neu between the first primary and the contralateral breast cancer was 0.4 (p = 0.002). The higher prevalence of estrogen receptor-negative contralateral breast cancer among tamoxifen users concurs with previous reports. The biological mechanism for this observation is not understood; however, it has been proposed that tamoxifen inhibits the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, while estrogen receptor-negative cells may continue to grow because of selective pressure. The correlation between HER-2/neu overexpression in the matched first primary and contralateral breast cancers was statistically significant, suggesting that the diagnosis of HER-2/neu overexpression in contralateral breast cancer is associated with HER-2/neu overexpression in the first primary cancer.",

Promoter hypermethylation of several known or putative tumor suppressor genes occurs frequently during the pathogenesis of breast cancer. We proposed that immunohistopathologic subtypes of breast cancer are likely to contain distinct promoter methylation patterns. A panel of 10 gene promoters was assessed by quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR in 114 invasive ductal carcinomas from Korea representing the three major subtypes [57 luminal, 24 human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), and 33 basal-like] based on immunohistochemical findings of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, cytokeratin 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor. The median methylation levels of HIN1, RASSF1A and TWIST, and the average methylation ratio were significantly lower in basal-like subtype compared to luminal or HER2 subtypes. In contrast, BRCA1 methylation level was significantly higher in basal-like subtype than in luminal subtype. The methylation status of a panel of four genes (APC1, CDH, BRCA1 and RAR-β) in luminal and HER2 subtypes were dissimilar, where HER2 tumors showed a significantly higher level of methylation compared to luminal tumors. These results suggest that gene methylation in breast cancer can potentially serve as epigenetic biomarkers and may contribute further to current breast cancer classification.",

Importantly, neu-specific antibody responses were restored only when AIT was combined with the depletion of MDSC.

To understand the mechanism of differential response to these two regimens, we have evaluated the effect of signaling through the ErbB2 receptor on downstream enzymes that may affect drug response, using two different models. The first system employs breast cancer cells that have high levels of endogenous ErbB2 by gene amplification (BT-474 and SKBR3 cells). The second system allows us to isolate the effect of ErbB2 receptor-mediated intracellular signaling using an epidermal growth factor receptor-ErbB2 chimeric receptor activated by epidermal growth factor. Our experiments show that the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin is inhibited in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells by the anti-ErbB2 antibody, Herceptin. This is accompanied by a decrease in topoisomerase (topo) IIalpha protein and activity, suggesting that this is the mechanism of change in doxorubicin response. In addition, a 10-100-fold (1-2 log) decrease in the LD(50) of doxorubicin is seen after ErbB2 activation using the chimeric receptor model. Furthermore, we see a 100-fold decrease in the LD(50) of etoposide, another topo II inhibitor. This increase in doxorubicin sensitivity is associated with a 4.5-fold increase in the amount of topo IIalpha protein and an increase in topo II activity as measured by DNA decatenating and unknotting activities, as well as cleavable complex formation. In contradistinction to doxorubicin, we have observed an increased resistance to cyclophosphamide chemotherapy after chimeric receptor activation. We propose that the differential benefit seen with doxorubicin- versus alkylator-based chemotherapy in ErbB2+ breast cancer is due, in some cases, to ErbB2-mediated topo IIalpha activation. These data also suggest hypotheses for the optimal sequencing of Herceptin and chemotherapy agents in ErbB2+ breast cancer.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between these two HER2 polymorphisms in normal breast and breast cancer tissues and known breast cancer prognostic factors in a retrospective cohort study of 73 women with non-metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. HER2 polymorphisms were assessed in breast cancer tissue and normal breast tissue using TaqMan assay. Ala1170Pro polymorphism in normal breast tissue was associated with age at diagnosis (p = 0.007), tumor size (p = 0.004) and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.06). Similar significant associations in cancer tissues were observed. No association between the Ile655Val polymorphism and prognostic factors were observed. However, we found significant differences in the distribution of Ile655Val (p = 0.03) and Ala1170Pro (p = 0.01) genotypes between normal breast and breast tumor tissues. This study demonstrates that only the Ala1170Pro polymorphism is associated with prognostic factors in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

EGFR activating mutations and high copy number (associated with response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib) and KIT activating mutations (associated with imatinib sensitivity) were then investigated. Seventy-seven metaplastic cases were identified (1976-2006); 38 with tumor blocks available underwent pathologic confirmation before EGFR and KIT immunohistochemical analyses. A tissue microarray of malignant glandular and metaplastic elements was constructed and analyzed immunohistochemically for cytokeratin 5/6, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and p63, and by fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGFR and HER-2/neu. DNA isolated from individual elements was assessed for EGFR and KIT activating mutations. All assessable cases were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and (except one) HER2. The majority were positive for cytokeratin 5/6 (58%), p63 (59%), and EGFR overexpression (66%); 24% were KIT positive. No EGFR or KIT activating mutations were present; 26% of the primary metaplastic breast carcinomas were fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive, displaying high EGFR copy number secondary to aneusomy (22%) and amplification (4%).

The cut-off levels (90% specificity) were determined for each test. Using these cut-off levels the diagnostic sensitivity of the CEA test was 0.23, for the AFP test it was 0.16, for the CA 15-3 test 0.27, for the TPS test 0.18 and for the Neu oncoprotein test 0.19 in detecting breast cancer. Correlation coefficients (Pearson's) were statistically significant between CEA and CA 15-3, and between CA 15-3 and Neu oncoprotein measurements in breast cancer patients. In patients with benign breast disease the serum levels of AFP, CA 15-3, CEA and TPS correlated with age, being somewhat higher in older patients. Similarly, in population controls higher age correlated with higher levels of AFP, CA 15-3, Neu and TPS. In breast cancer patients there was no correlation between the age at diagnosis and any of the measured markers. The only marker statistically significantly associated with the stage of breast cancer was CA 15-3.

Using microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry, we determined that higher levels of Skp2 are present more frequently in ER-negative tumors than in ER-positive cases. Interestingly, the subset of ER-negative breast carcinomas overexpressing Skp2 are also characterized by high tumor grade, negativity for Her-2, basal-like phenotype, high expression of certain cell cycle regulatory genes, and low levels of p27 protein. We also found that Skp2 expression is cell adhesion-dependent in normal human mammary epithelial cells but not in breast cancer cells and that an inhibition of Skp2 induces a decrease of adhesion-independent growth in both ER-positive and ER-negative cancer cells. Finally, forced expression of Skp2 abolished effects of antiestrogens, suggesting that deregulated Skp2 expression might play a role in the development of resistance to antiestrogens. We conclude that Skp2 has oncogenic potential in breast epithelial cells and is overexpressed in a subset of breast carcinomas (ER- and Her-2 negative) for which Skp2 inhibitors may represent a valid therapeutic option.",

PARP inhibitors target homologous recombination (HR)-deficient tumors, such as the BRCA-associated breast and ovarian cancers. In this study, we show that HER2+ breast cancers are susceptible to PARP inhibition independent of an HR deficiency. HER2 overexpression in HER2 negative breast cancer cells was sufficient to render cells susceptible to the PARP inhibitors ABT-888 and AZD-2281 both in vitro and in vivo, which was abrogated by HER2 reduction. In addition, ABT-888 significantly inhibited NF-κB (p65/RelA) transcriptional activity in HER2+ but not HER2 negative breast cancer cells. This corresponded with a reduction in phosphorylated p65 and total IKKα levels, with a concomitant increase in IκBα. Overexpression of p65 abrogated cellular sensitivity to ABT-888, whereas IκBα overexpression reduced cell viability to a similar extent as ABT-888. Therefore, susceptibility of HER2+ breast cancer cells to PARP inhibition may be because of inhibition of NF-κB signaling driven by HER2. Our findings indicate that PARP inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy for sporadic HER2+ breast cancer patients.",

An engineered anti-HER-2 chimeric A21 antibody (chA21) is a chimeric antibody targeted to subdomain I of the HER2 extracellular domain. Here, we report the anti-tumor activity of the novel engineered monoclonal antibody humanized chA21 (HuA21) that targets HER2 on the basis of chA21, and we describe the underlying mechanisms. Our results reveal that HuA21 markedly inhibits the proliferation and migration of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells and causes enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity potency against HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. In particular, HuA21, but not trastuzumab (Tra), markedly suppresses growth and enhances the internalization of the antibody in Tra-resistant BT-474 breast cancer cells. These characteristics are highly associated with the intrinsic ability of HuA21 to down-regulate HER2 activation and inhibit the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways. Furthermore, the combination of HuA21 with Tra synergistically enhances the anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo and inhibits HER2 activation and the ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways.

This 10-mer was recognized by all tumor-specific FVB/N T cells generated regardless of the TCR Vbeta region expressed by the T cell or the method of vaccination used, establishing it as the immunodominant MHC class I epitope in neu. T cells specific for this epitope were able to cure FVB/N mice of transplanted neu-expressing tumor cells, demonstrating that this is a naturally processed peptide. Altered peptide analogs of the epitope were analyzed for immunogenicity. Vaccination with dendritic cells pulsed with a heteroclitic peptide provided FVB/N and neu-N mice with increased protection against tumor challenge as compared with mice immunized with dendritic cells loaded with either wild-type or irrelevant peptide. Discovery of this epitope allows for better characterization of the CD8(+) T cell responses in the neu-N mouse model in which neu-specific tolerance must be overcome to produce effective antitumor immunity.",

HER2 amplification and overexpression defines the HER2+ subgroup of breast cancer patients and is both a prognostic marker for poor outcome and a predictive marker for response to anti-HER2 targeted therapies. Therefore, there is considerable interest in documenting the locations of other recurring amplifications in breast cancers as they may also provide a rich source of new biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for these subgroups.

The objective of this study is to explore the combination therapy of blocking HER-2 and VEGF expressions simultaneously using siRNA. This is the first report to examine the effect of dual silencing of HER-2 and VEGF genes on tumor growth and invasiveness. We have designed nine HER-2 siRNAs and ten VEGF siRNAs, and identified potent siRNA which can silence the target gene up to 75-83.5%. The most potent HER-2 and VEGF siRNAs were used to conduct functional studies in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells. Tumor invasiveness properties including cell morphology change, in vitro migration, cell spreading, and adhesion to ECM were evaluated. In addition, cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined after the siRNA treatment. Our data demonstrated for the first time that HER-2 siRNA could inhibit cell migration and invasion abilities. Combination of HER-2 and VEGF siRNAs exhibited synergistic silencing effect on VEGF. Both HER-2 siRNA and VEGF siRNA showed significant inhibition on cell migration and proliferation. HER-2 siRNA also demonstrated dramatic suppression on cell spreading and adhesion to ECM, as well as induction of apoptosis. Dual silencing of HER-2 and VEGF exhibited significant cell morphology change, and substantial suppression on migration, spreading, cell adhesion, and proliferation. Our observations suggested that HER-2 positive breast cancer may be more effectively treated by dual inhibition of HER-2 and VEGF gene expressions using siRNA.",

Recent report on salivary duct carcinomas for HER-2/neu using immunohistochemistry (IHC) has shown over-expression in most cases. However, correlation between IHC and molecular genetic analysis of HER-2/neu in salivary duct carcinoma has not yet been performed.;We have now evaluated 11 cases of salivary duct carcinomas for HER-2/neu status using IHC and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). To our knowledge, this is the first molecular genetic analysis of HER-2/neu in salivary duct carcinoma.;In immunohistochemistry, over-expression of HER-2/neu protein was identified as distinct membrane staining in most carcinoma cells in all our salivary duct carcinoma cases, while only four cases revealed an amplification of HER-2/neu gene by means of FISH analysis. Both amplified and non-amplified salivary duct carcinomas with strong immunohistochemical staining for HER-2/neu protein were associated with poor clinical outcome for the patients. Apparently, HER-2/neu protein over-expression could also be controlled by mechanisms other than gene amplification. In the group of salivary gland tumours other than salivary duct carcinoma, strong over-expression was detected only in three cases of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

The role of HST in adult human tissues and disease remains unexplored. Here, we investigated HST expression at the mRNA and protein (immunohistochemistry [IHC]) level in parallel with parameters reflecting HER activation in 187 breast carcinomas and matched noncancerous breast tissues (NCBT). Noncancerous breast tissues demonstrated the highest HST/HER2 transcript ratios corresponding to a few positive epithelial and stromal cells by IHC. Although HST/HER2 transcript ratios in tumors were inversely associated with HER2 IHC grading (P = .0048 for HER2 IHC-1+ and P = .0006 for HER2 IHC-2+ vs HER2-negative tumors), relative HST expression within the same tumor/NCBT system remained constant. HST/HER2 ratios did not predict the presence of HST protein, which was found in 46 (25%) of 187 tumors. A subgroup of HER2 IHC-3+ tumors exhibited high HST/HER2 transcript ratios, strong HST protein positivity, and cytoplasmic phospho-Akt/PKB and p21(CIP1/WAF1) localization. In conclusion, HST may act as a paracrine factor in the adult breast.

We have investigated cell-mediated effector mechanisms of HER-2/neu antibodies against breast cancer cell lines. Compared to unfractionated control blood, whole blood from patients during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment exhibits significantly enhanced lysis (P < 0.001) of SK-BR-3 cells in the presence of HER-2/neu antibody 520C9. The extent of tumor cell killing correlated positively (r = 0.74) to polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) blood counts. Fractionation of whole blood into plasma, mononuclear cells, and PMNs showed major killing capacity to reside in the granulocyte fraction. PMNs were efficiently cytolytic with a panel of HER-2/neu antibodies and against various breast cancer cell lines. Experiments with blocking antibodies to Fc(gamma)R documented Fc(gamma)RII (CD32) as the major trigger molecule for monoclonal antibody 502C9-mediated cytotoxicity. Killing via 520C9 was significantly influenced by an allotypic polymorphism of Fc(gamma)RIIa, the CD32 molecule expressed on PMNs. In reverse antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity experiments with a panel of HER-2/neu-directed bispecific antibodies, Fc(gamma)RIII (CD16) proved to be an efficient trigger molecule in blood from healthy volunteers. During G-CSF treatment, however, Fc(gamma)RI (CD64)-expressed on monocytes and G-CSF primed, but not on healthy donor PMNs-became the predominant cytotoxic trigger molecule. Thus, G-CSF application increased effector cell numbers for HER-2/neu-directed immunotherapy, and G-CSF primed PMNs proved particularly effective with a [HER-2/neu x Fc(gamma)RI] bispecific antibody. These findings support clinical trials with HER-2/neu-directed antibodies in combination with G-CSF in breast cancer patients overexpressing HER-2/neu.",

In HER2+ breast cancer, we found altered DNA methylation in genes involved in multicellular development, differentiation and transcription. Within these genes, we observed an overrepresentation of homeobox family genes, including several genes that have not been previously reported in relation to cancer (DBX1, NKX2-6, SIX6). Other affected genes included several belonging to the PI3K and Wnt signaling pathways. Notably, HER2, AKT3, HK1, and PFKP, genes for which altered methylation has not been previously reported, were also identified in this analysis. In total, we report 69 candidate biomarker genes with maximum differential methylation in HER2+ breast cancer. External validation of gene expression in a selected group of these genes (n = 13) revealed lowered mean gene expression in HER2+ breast cancer. We analyzed DNA methylation in six top candidate genes (AKR1B1, INA, FOXC2, NEUROD1, CDKL2, IRF4) using EpiTect Methyl II Custom PCR Array and confirmed the 450K array findings.

HER2 gene amplification or protein overexpression is encountered in approximately 20% of newly diagnosed breast cancers and is a validated adverse prognostic factor with a mean relative risk for overall survival of 2.74. A series of quality assurance recommendations for the marketed slide-based HER2 testing approaches including immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH/SISH) has recently been published by the American Society of Clini- cal Oncology - College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP). Testing issues, such as the impact of chromosome 17 polysomy and local versus central HER2 testing and emerging novel HER2 testing techniques, including messenger RNA (mRNA)-based testing by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA microarray methods, HER2 receptor dimerization, phosphorylated HER2 receptors and HER2 status in circulating tumor cells are of current interest in the management of breast cancer. Also of significant interest are the evolving lists of biomarkers proposed to predict resistance to the major anti-HER2 therapies, trastuzumab and lapatinib.",

Because oncoantigens are self-tolerated molecules, to trigger a response circumventing tolerance, we generated two plasmids (RHuT and HuRT) coding for chimeric neu-Her-2 extracellular and transmembrane proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane of the transfected cells and recognized by monoclonal antibodies reacting against neu and Her-2. RHuT encodes a protein in which the 410 NH(2)-terminal residues are from the neu extracellular domain and the remaining residues from Her-2. Almost symmetrically, HuRT encodes for a protein in which the 390 NH(2)-terminal residues are from Her-2 and the remainder from neu. The ability of RHuT and HuRT to elicit a protective response to neu and Her-2 in wild-type mice and in transgenic mice tolerant to neu and Her-2 proteins was compared with that of plasmids coding for the fully rat or fully human extracellular and transmembrane domains of the Erbb-2 receptor. In most cases, RHuT and HuRT elicited a stronger response, although this chimeric benefit is markedly modulated by the location of the heterologous moiety in the protein coded by the plasmid, the immune tolerance of the responding mouse, and the kind of Erbb-2 orthologue on the targeted tumor.",

Ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of HER2 assays by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) requires a reliable standard for monitoring assay sensitivity and specificity, and for assessing methodologic variation. A prior NIST workshop addressed this need by reaching a consensus to create cell lines as reference materials for HER2 testing.;Breast carcinoma cell lines SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 were characterized quantitatively by IHC with chicken anti-HER2 IgY antibody and by FISH with biotinylated bacterial artificial chromosome DNA probes; both assays used quantum dots as detectors. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell blocks were prepared and tested for suitability as candidate reference materials by IHC and FISH with commercially available reagents. IHC and FISH results were also compared with those obtained by laser-scanning cytometry and real-time PCR, respectively.;MCF-7 cells had typical numbers of gene copies and very low production of HER2 protein, whereas SK-BR-3 cells contained approximately 10-fold more copies of the gene and exhibited approximately 15-fold higher amounts of HER2 protein than MCF-7 cells. FFPE SK-BR-3 cells showed results similar to those for fresh SK-BR-3 cells.;SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 are suitable as candidate reference materials in QC of HER2 testing. Coupled with the associated assay platforms, they provide valuable controls for quantitative measurement of HER2 amplification and production in breast cancer samples, irrespective of the antibody/probe or detector used.",

The study was designed to assess the usefulness of HER-2 gene amplification, serum nucleosomes, CEA and CA15.3 tumor markers in the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma and analyze whether their levels correlate with the clinicopathological features. The study was carried out on fifty patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and 25 age matched women with benign breast diseases (BBD). Cancer patients were categorised into three subgroups according to absence (-) or presence (+) of axillary lymph nodes (N) or presence of distant metastasis (M+) into: subgroup I (N-) included 15 patients, subgroup II (N+) included 20 patients and subgroup III (M+) included 15 patients. All individuals were subjected to CBC, fasting blood sugar, liver & kidney function tests, CEA and CA15.3 by electrochemiluminescence, serum nucleosomes by cell death detection ELISA and amplification of HER-2 gene by differential PCR. The HER-2 gene PCR results were + ve in 28% of cancer patients; 20% of subgroup I, 25% of subgroup II and 40% of subgroup III, but in none of the BBD patients. HER-2 gene amplification results showed significant positive correlation with tumor grade. Serum nucleosomes showed significant increase in cancer patients as compared to that of BBD group, significant negative correlation with HER-2 gene amplification and significant positive correlation with CA15.3. Serum nucleosomes was the most sensitive marker (76% versus 32% and 50% for CEA & CA15.3 respectively) but the least specific (72% versus 92% and 96% for CEA & CA15.3 respectively). Elevated CEA and CA15.3 levels were detected in 13.3% and 33.3% respectively in node negative patients, these percentage increased in node positive patients to 20% and 40% and in metastatic patients to 66.7% and 80% respectively. In conclusion, serum nucleosomes is more sensitive but less specific marker than CEA and CA15.3 for diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer.

Hybridization studies were also performed on 66 of the breast cancer cases. In the cancers 33% of cases showed positive staining of the in situ and invasive component, whereas only 25% of cases showed amplification of the Neu oncogene. The staining pattern in the tumor cells was cytoplasmic with plasma membrane accentuation. Focal positive cytoplasmic staining was noted in some cases of fibrocystic disease, fibroadenoma, and normal breast duct epithelium. Myoepithelial cells and smooth muscle of blood vessels also showed a positive reaction. This study shows that the Neu oncoprotein can be demonstrated on formalin-fixed material from normal, benign, and malignant breast lesions. In the breast cancers the differences in the number of cases showing amplification and those showing a positive immunohistochemical reaction could be due to increased transcriptional activity.

        "Doc_abstract":"ALK has emerged as a novel tumorigenic factor in several epithelial human cancers. Crizotinib, an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is currently approved to treat lung cancer patients exhibiting ALK gene rearrangements. Our goal was to determine the incidence of ALK aberrations in relation to different breast cancer types. Tissue micro-arrays were constructed of ER+/PR±/HER2- (n = 37), ER-/PR-/HER2+ (n = 15), ER-/PR-/HER2- (n = 61) and ER+/PR+/HER2+ (n = 20) breast cancers; including 13 inflammatory breast carcinomas. FISH was performed using ALK break-apart and chromosome 2 centromere enumeration probes (CEP2). Neither ALK rearrangements nor amplification were identified in the 133 breast cancer cases evaluated. However, copy number gains (CNG) of ALK were identified in 82 of 133 patients (62 %). The CEP2 analysis revealed polysomy of chromosome 2 in all HCNG and LCNG cases, indicating the CNG of ALK are due to polysomy of chromosome 2, rather than true amplification of ALK. To conclude, we observed CNG of ALK secondary to chromosome 2 polysomy in a significant percentage of breast cancer cases, a phenomenon similar to polysomy 17. This study is one of the largest studies to have investigated ALK aberrations in breast cancer and the only study to include all subtypes. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Interferons (IFNs) are known to possess potent antitumor properties. Previous studies have indicated that IFNs are capable of modulating the expression of various tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. In this study, we looked at the effect of IFN-gamma on the neu/HER-2 proto-oncogene in the DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. IFN-gamma inhibited cell proliferation in both DU145 and PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no inhibition of proliferation was seen in LNCaP cells. Correspondingly, IFN-gamma treatment of DU145 and PC-3 cells resulted in an increased production of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1), whereas no increase in p21(WAF1) was seen in LNCaP cells. In addition, IFN-gamma induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 in DU145 and PC-3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. Consistent with these findings, we found that IFN-gamma treatment of DU145 and PC-3 cells caused a reduction in neu/HER-2 expression, with no change seen in the LNCaP cell line. Transfection and overexpression of the transcriptional coactivator p300 in PC-3 cells suppressed the reduction in neu/HER-2 expression after IFN-gamma treatment, suggesting a role for p300 in neu/HER-2 expression. The antiproliferative activity and p21(WAF1) production of these cells after IFN-gamma treatment were found to be reduced as well. We propose that the down-regulation of neu/HER-2 by IFN-gamma occurs via the interaction of phosphorylated STAT1 with p300 because IFN-gamma activities requiring phosphorylated STAT1 are reduced in cells overexpressing p300. These findings suggest that neu/HER-2 may play a role in the growth of some prostate cancers and that IFN-gamma may suppress such cancers by down-regulation of neu/HER-2.",

In approximately 5% of breast cancers, ISH assays fail. In these cases, HER2 protein expression is evaluated by IHC alone that may yield false negatives/positives for poor-quality samples. Therefore, we developed a method that was based on quantitative real-time PCR applicable for DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Its limit of detection was determined with breast cancer cell lines and validated with 223 breast cancer patient samples. On the basis of comparisons with fluorescent ISH (FISH) and IHC data, the sensitivity of the new method was 94.2% and 95.1%, its specificity was 100% and 99.1%, and overall concordance between results obtained with the quantitative real-time PCR method and FISH/IHC was 97.6% for both methods. The quantitative real-time PCR method was then used to evaluate the HER2 status of 198 of 3696 breast cancer tissues that yielded indeterminate FISH results. The HER2 copy number was successfully determined in 69.2% of these indeterminate samples. Thus, the DNA-based technique appears to be a specific, sensitive method for determining HER2 copy numbers when the FISH assay fails, which may complement IHC tests. ",

HER-2 overexpression was scored according to standard HercepTest guidelines (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Overexpression of topo2a was identified when nuclear staining was found in more than 5% of tumor cells. Of 113 tumors, 104 were analyzed successfully for HER-2 and topo2a amplification. Of the 104, 64 showed HER-2 amplification; 25 of these (39%) also showed topo2a amplification. No amplification was found in 40 tumors. Deletion of topo2a was seen in 7 (11%) of 64 HER-2-amplified tumors and 2 (5%) of 40 nonamplified tumors. Of 25 tumors with topo2a amplification, 18 (72%) overexpressed topo2a. Only 3 (4%) of 79 tumors without topo2a amplification overexpressed topo2a. Amplification of topo2a is associated with HER-2 amplification but not vice versa.

We sought to determine whether there are specific sequences of occurrence of these progressive evolutionary changes in human breast cancers by performing correlated cell-by-cell measurements of cell DNA content, p53 protein, Her-2/neu protein, and ras protein by multiparameter flow cytometry in 56 primary tumor samples obtained at surgery. In addition, p53 allelic loss and Her-2/neu gene amplification were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization in cells from the same samples. We reasoned that if there is a specific order in which genetic changes occur, the same early changes would be found consistently in the cells with the fewest abnormalities. We reasoned further that late-developing abnormalities would not occur alone in individual cells but would almost always be found together with the early changes inherited by the same cells. By these criteria, abnormalities involving p53 generally occurred early in the course of development of invasive breast cancers, whereas ras protein overexpression was found to be a late-occurring phenomenon. Within individual tumors, cellular p53 overexpression was often observed alone in individual cells, whereas ras protein overexpression was rarely observed in the absence of p53 overexpression and/or Her-2/neu overexpression in the same cells. Furthermore, the intracellular level of each abnormally expressed protein was found to increase progressively as new abnormalities were acquired. Infiltrating ductal carcinomas exhibited characteristic phenotypic patterns in which p53 allelic loss and/or p53 protein overexpression, Her-2/neu amplification and/or overexpression, aneuploidy, and ras overexpression accumulated within individual cells. However, this pattern was not a prominent feature of lobular breast cancers. All six lobular breast cancers studied were diploid. p53 allelic loss and/or early p53 overexpression, and late ras cooverexpression in the same cells were less common in lobular breast cancers than in infiltrating ductal carcinomas. Although Her-21neu overexpression was a common finding in lobular breast cancers, Her-2/neu amplification was not observed in these tumors.",

To evaluate the correlation between histopathology variables and gene expression/amplification in the sequence BE-low grade dysplasia-high grade dysplasia-adenocarcinoma, fifty esophageal specimens from patients with a diagnosis of BE (21 BE, 4 low-grade dysplasia, 12 high-grade dysplasia, and 13 adenocarcinomas) were evaluated. Histopathologic evaluation was carried out using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Paraffin-embedded tissues were investigated for Her-2 by immunohistochemistry (HercepTest) and FISH. HercepTest was scored 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ depending on the percentage (cut off 10%) of membrane staining, whereas gene assessment evaluated by FISH was based on the ratio between Her-2/neu and the 17 chromosome copy number. There was a positive correlation between gene amplification and protein overexpression. No case with HercepTest scoring 0 or 1+ displayed gene amplification, but this was present in 20% of cases scoring 2+ and in all cases scoring 3+. Her-2/neu amplification or overexpression was never observed in BE. Gene amplification and overexpression was observed in more than 50% of dysplasias and adenocarcinomas.

Our lab recently reported that HER2+ breast cancers also exhibit sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) by attenuating the NF-κB pathway. In this study, we assessed PARP1 and phospho-p65, a marker of activated NF-κB levels in human breast cancer tissues. PARP1 and PARP2 copy number, mRNA, and protein expression was assessed by interrogating the PAM-50 defined breast cancer patient set from the TCGA using cBioPortal. PARP1 and phospho-p65 immunohistochemistry and correlation to clinical parameters was conducted using 307 primary breast cancer specimens (132 basal, 82 luminal, 93 HER2+) through univariate and multivariate analyses. In the PAM50 breast cancer data set, PARP1 and 2 expression was altered in 24/58 (41 %) HER2+, 32/81 (40 %) basal, and 75/324 (23 %) luminal A/B breast cancer patients. This correlated with a statistically significant increase in PARP1 protein levels in HER2+ and basal but not luminal breast cancers (p = 0.003, p = 0.027, p = 0.289, respectively). No change in PARP2 protein level was observed. Interestingly, using breast cancer specimens from 307 patients, HER2 positivity correlated with elevated PARP1 expression (p < 0.0001) and was three times more likely than HER2 negative breast cancers to exhibit high PARP1 levels. No significant differences were noted between race, ER status, or PR status for PARP1 expression. Additionally, we found a significant correlation between HER2 status and phospho-p65 expression (p < 0.0001). Lastly, a direct correlation between PARP1 and phospho-p65 (p < 0.0001) was noted. These results indicate a potential connection between HER2, PARP1, and phospho-p65. Furthermore, these data suggest that the PARPi sensitivity we previously observed in HER2+ breast cancer cells may be due to elevated PARP1 expression.",

A total of 134 cases of male breast cancer were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as for CK5/6, CK14, and Ki67. HER2 was also assessed by chromogen in situ hybridization. Cases were classified as luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2- and Ki67 low), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2+ or Ki67 high), HER2 driven (ER-, PR-, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, CK5/6+ and/or CK14+ and/or EGFR+), or unclassifiable triple-negative (negative for all six markers). Luminal type A was by far the most encountered type of male breast cancers, representing 75% of the cases. Luminal type B was seen in 21% and the remaining 4% of cases were classified as basal-like (n=4) and unclassifiable triple-negative (n=1). No HER2 driven cases were identified. Patients with basal-like cancer were significantly younger (P=0.034). Luminal B type cancers showed significantly higher histological grade (P<0.001), mitotic index (P<0.001), and PR negativity (P=0.005) compared with luminal type A cancers. In conclusion, most male breast cancers are luminal A and luminal B types, whereas basal-like, unclassifiable triple-negative, and HER2 driven male breast cancers are rare. Luminal type B seem to represent a subtype with an aggressive phenotype. This distribution of molecular subtypes in male breast cancer is clearly different compared with female breast cancers, pointing to possible important differences in carcinogenesis.",

The stimulation of PKCalpha up-regulated HER2 expression, whereas PKCalpha inhibition by pharmacologic treatments and PKCalpha-specific small interfering RNA led to a dramatic down-regulation of HER2 levels only in breast cancer cells HER2 2+. Consistent with the in vitro data, our biochemical analysis of HER2 2+ human primary breast specimens revealed significantly higher levels of phosphorylated PKCalpha compared with HER2-negative tumors. Inhibition of HER2 activation by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib led to decreased levels of PKCalpha phosphorylation, clearly indicating a cross-talk between PKCalpha and HER2 molecules.

        "Doc_abstract":"Growing evidence has demonstrated that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is involved in the radiation response to breast cancer. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated if HER2 overexpression is associated with radiosensitivity of breast cancer. We constructed breast cancer cell lines differing in HER2 expression by transducing HER2 cDNA or short hairpin RNA against HER2. We then assessed the radiosensitivity and investigated the potential mechanism by using cell proliferation assay, cell adhesion assays, anoikis assays, colony formation assays, and western blotting analyses. We found that HER2 introduction in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (low HER2 expression) and MDA-MB-231 (HER2 is not expressed) promoted cell proliferation and invasion and enhanced cell adhesion and resistance to anoikis. Moreover, HER2 reduced radiosensitivity in these two cells compared with the corresponding control. The opposite results were observed when HER2 was silenced in breast cancer cell lines ZR-7530 and SK-BR-3 (both cells with high expression of HER2) using HER2 shRNA. In addition, animal experiment results showed HER2 could enhance the radioresistance of xenograft tumors. Further studies showed HER2 promoted the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (Fak) and thereby up-regulated the expression of proteins associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition such as Claudin-1, ZO-1, and ZEB-1. The inhibition of Fak activity using the Fak inhibitor (PF-562281) restored the radiosensitivity in HER2-overexpressing cells. In conclusion, HER2 reduces the radiosensitivity of breast cancer by activating Fak in vitro and in vivo. Fak might be a potential target for the radiosensitization of HER2-overexpressed breast cancer.",

Twenty eight patients with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled in the study and the control group consisted of 19 clinically healthy women. Six milliliters of peripheral blood was drawn for the analyses, but only in two patients the blood has been drawn twice. Blood samples were taken when no chemotherapy was administered, but hormonal therapy has been allowed.;The positivity for CTCs was found in 20 (50.0 %) patients with metastatic breast cancer patients, while in 6 (31.6 %) healthy controls false positive circulating epithelial-like cells were detected. Because we did not use CD45 staining, we could not distinguish these circulating epithelial-like cells from CTCs. In a majority of metastatic breast cancer patients we found a mixed population of HER-2 gene expressing CTCs.

Among them, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) overexpression has been shown in 60% to 80% of DCIS cases. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that selectively inhibits COX-2. In this study, we evaluated whether COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib can reduce the incidence of preinvasive breast cancer and its progression to invasive breast cancer in a mouse model exhibiting a similar phenotype to human solid-pattern DCIS. We have used the mouse model mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu to investigate this possibility. These mice carry a rat Her-2/Neu transgene and are known to develop DCIS-like lesions. Our results showed that celecoxib (500 ppm) given as prophylaxis was neither able to prevent tumor development nor delay tumor appearance compared with untreated mice. Furthermore, when the drug was given early in tumorigenesis, it did not reduce the progression of preinvasive to invasive tumors nor prevent lung metastasis. Reduction of prostaglandin levels was, however, achieved in mammary tumors of treated mice. In addition, celecoxib treatment caused an increase in apoptosis and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor expression in treated animals. Our results contrast with some previously published studies and highlight the complexity of the relationship between COX-2 and breast cancer.",

Some studies have shown p53 overexpression in breast cancer to be an independent prognostic indicator. A subset of breast cancers have chromosome 17 polysomy. Although p53 immunostaining has been found to correlate with chromosome 17 polysomy in nonsmall cell lung carcinomas, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and bladder carcinomas, its expression has not been correlated with chromosome 17 polysomy in breast carcinomas. In this study, we compared p53 expression by immunohistochemistry in cases of invasive breast carcinoma showing unamplified chromosome 17 polysomy (P) with cases showing HER2 amplification (A) and with those showing neither amplification nor polysomy (N). There was a significant overexpression of p53 in both cases with HER2 amplification and unamplified polysomy 17 compared with cases with neither amplification nor polysomy (7% of N, 25% of P, and 37% of A group were p53 positive). We have shown in an earlier study that invasive breast carcinoma with unamplified chromosome 17 polysomy is associated with several adverse prognostic indicators including a higher Nottingham score and greater estrogen receptor (ER) negativity with a trend toward the amplified group, in contrast to patients with neither amplification nor polysomy. In this study, we now show that p53 positivity in unamplified 17 polysomy identifies cases that are associated with an even higher Nottingham score and greater hormone receptor negativity that is similar to cases with HER2 amplification.",

Continued delineation of tumour biology has identified splice variants of HER-2, with contrasting roles in tumour cell biology. For example, the splice variant Δ16HER-2 (results from exon 16 skipping) increases transformation of cancer cells and is associated with treatment resistance; conversely, Herstatin (results from intron 8 retention) and p100 (results from intron 15 retention) inhibit tumour cell proliferation. This review focuses on the potential clinical implications of the expression and coexistence of HER-2 splice variants in cancer cells in relation to breast cancer progression and drug resistance. \"Individualised\" strategies currently guide breast cancer management; in accordance, HER-2 splice variants may prove valuable as future prognostic and predictive factors, as well as potential therapeutic targets.

Investigating effects of AMPK activation on breast cancer cell signaling and survival, we found that breast cancer cell lines with amplification and over-expression of HER2 or EGFR are 2- to 5-fold more sensitive to cytotoxic effects of AICAR, a canonical pharmacological activator of AMPK, than breast cancer cell lines lacking HER2 or EGFR overexpression. Paralleling effects on cell survival, AICAR leads to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of HER2 and EGFR in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells, with activation of AMPK and suppression of HER2/ EGFR activity preceding commitment to cell death. Transfection of constitutively active AMPKα also leads to decreased HER2 and EGFR phosphorylation, reduced downstream signaling associated with these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and reduced breast cancer cell growth, confirming effects of AMPK activity on HER2/ EGFR. Ensuing co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an interaction of HER2 with AMPK and an in vitro phosphorylation assay found that HER2 and EGFR contain sequences that are potential substrates for AMPK. Our results lead us to postulate that AMPK regulates HER2 and EGFR activity in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells and thus activation of AMPK might provide therapeutic benefit in such cancers. ",

The relatively weak correlation between HER2 status and response to HER2-targeting drugs suggests that measurement of HER2 signaling activity, rather than absolute HER2 levels, may more accurately diagnose HER2-driven breast cancer. A new diagnostic test, the CELx HER2 Signaling Profile (CELx HSP) test, is demonstrated to measure real-time HER2 signaling function in live primary cells. In the present study, epithelial cells extracted fresh from breast cancer patient tumors classified as HER2 negative (HER2-, n = 34 of which 33 were estrogen receptor positive) and healthy subjects (n = 16) were evaluated along with reference breast cancer cell lines (n = 19). Live cell response to specific HER2 agonists (NRG1b and EGF) and antagonist (pertuzumab) was measured. Of the HER2- breast tumor cell samples tested, 7 of 34 patients (20.5%; 95% CI = 10%-37%) had HER2 signaling activity that was characterized as abnormally high. Amongst the tumor samples there was no correlation between HER2 protein status (by cell cytometry) and HER2 signaling activity (hyperactive or normal) (Regression analysis P = 0.144, R2 = 0.068). One conclusion is that measurement of HER2 signaling activity can identify a subset of breast cancers with normal HER2 receptor levels with abnormally high levels of HER2 signaling.

The heterogeneous expression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) in cancers supports tumor signaling robustness and plays a significant role in resistance to targeted inhibition. Recent studies have revealed interactions between the MET receptor and the ERBB receptor family in the therapeutic resistance of several cancers. In this study, the relationship between MET expression/activity and the expression/activity of the ERBB receptor family in human breast cancer was interrogated. Importantly, a significant percentage of ERBB2(+) tumors coexpressing MET and ERBB2 were observed and displayed significant heterogeneity with subpopulations of cells that are MET(-)/ERBB2(+), MET(+)/ERBB2(-), and MET(+)/ERBB2(+). In a MET(+)/ERBB2(+) breast cancer cell line, MET depletion resulted in increased ERBB2 activation, and conversely, ERBB2 depletion resulted in increased MET activation. Neither EGFR nor ERBB3 compensated for MET or ERBB2 knockdown. The loss of either MET or ERBB2 led to a decrease in PI3K/AKT signaling and increased dependency on MAPK. These data show that a subset of ERBB2(+) breast cancers express MET and contain MET(+)/ERBB2(+) subpopulations. Moreover, analysis of RTK activation during ERBB2 knockdown indicated that MET signaling is a compensatory pathway of resistance.;ERBB2(+) breast cancers with MET(+)/ERBB2(+) subpopulations may have an innate resistance to ERBB2 inhibition and may benefit from combined MET and ERBB2 inhibition.",

The efficacy of lapatinib as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, however, is limited by the development of therapeutic resistance that typically occurs within 12 months of starting therapy. In contrast to small molecule inhibitors targeting other receptor tyrosine kinases where resistance has been attributed to mutations within the targeted receptor, ErbB2 mutations have not been commonly found in breast tumors. Instead, acquired resistance to lapatinib seems to be mediated by redundant survival pathways that are activated as a consequence of marked inhibition of ErbB2 kinase activity. For example, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol3 kinase-Akt in lapatinib-treated cells leads to derepression of FOXO3A, a transcription factor that up-regulates estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, resulting in a switch in the regulation of survival factors (e.g., survivin) and cell survival from ErbB2 alone to ER and ErbB2 in resistant cells. In this review, we discuss the effects of lapatinib on signaling networks in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells to elucidate potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and strategies to overcome or prevent its development.",

The variable clinical outcomes seen in patients with similar HER2 status, given similar treatments, suggests that the effects of amplification of HER2 can be influenced by other genetic changes. To assess the broader genomic implications of structural changes at the HER2 locus, we investigated relationships between genomic instability and HER2 status in patients with invasive breast cancer.;HER2 status was determined using the PathVysion assay. DNA was extracted after laser microdissection from the 181 paraffin-embedded HER2 amplified (n=39) or HER2 negative (n=142) tumor specimens with sufficient tumor available to perform molecular analysis. Allelic imbalance (AI) was assessed using a panel of microsatellite markers representing 26 chromosomal regions commonly altered in breast cancer. Student t-tests and partial correlations were used to investigate relationships between genomic instability and HER2 status.;The frequency of AI was significantly higher (P<0.005) in HER2 amplified (27%) compared to HER2 negative tumors (19%). Samples with HER2 amplification showed significantly higher levels of AI (P<0.05) at chromosomes 11q23, 16q22-q24 and 18q21. Partial correlations including ER status and tumor grade supported associations between HER2 status and alterations at 11q13.1, 16q22-q24 and 18q21.;The poor prognosis associated with HER2 amplification may be attributed to global genomic instability as cells with high frequencies of chromosomal alterations have been associated with increased cellular proliferation and aggressive behavior. In addition, high levels of DNA damage may render tumor cells refractory to treatment. In addition, specific alterations at chromosomes 11q13, 16q22-q24, and 18q21, all of which have been associated with aggressive tumor behavior, may serve as genetic modifiers to HER2 amplification. These data not only improve our understanding of HER in breast pathogenesis but may allow more accurate risk profiles and better treatment options to be developed.",

The HER-2/neu oncogenic protein is such a 'self' tumour antigen. Rat neu is homologous with human HER-2/neu and provides a model system for studying vaccination strategies. Rats are tolerant to rat neu. Vaccination with this 'self' protein elicits no detectable immune response. The current studies evaluated whether tolerance to rat neu can be circumvented by immunizing with the highly homologous foreign human HER-2/neu protein. Rats were immunized with human HER-2/neu intracellular domain (hICD) protein that is 92% homologous to rat neu ICD. Animals immunized with hICD developed significant antibody and T-cell responses that were specific for both human HER-2/neu and rat neu. Neu-specific antibodies were present in titres of greater than 1:200,000. Analysis of the specificity of the antibody response using synthetic peptides demonstrated substantial reactivity to an epitope with 100% homology between rat and human protein. Significant T-cell responses (stimulation index > 10) to hICD and rat neu protein (stimulation index > 4) were detected. The T cells also responded to both human and rat ICD. The results imply that immunization with foreign proteins, which are highly homologous to 'self' tumour antigens, may be an effective vaccine strategy for 'self' tumour antigens.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There are many controversies regarding the treatment of very early-stage (pT1a/bN0M0) breast cancer (BC), generally considered to have a very good prognosis. The debate is the benefit of an adjuvant treatment of HER2-neu (namely HER-2)-positive subcentimetric carcinoma with trastuzumab. Current guidelines do not suggest, with the highest level of evidence, whether trastuzumab should be administered after adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of high-risk pT1a/bN0M0 breast cancer. The major phase III trials that confirmed the benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy did not include small (<1 cm diameter) node-negative breast cancer. Several retrospective case series of HER-2-positive pT1a/bN0M0 carcinoma seem to demonstrate that they have a higher risk of relapse compared to the HER-2-negative counterpart. HER-2 also seems to confer an independent risk of recurrence and/or death in a multivariate analysis within large node-negative breast cancer populations. In particular, the best way to select higher-risk tumours that may achieve the best results from a trastuzumab-based therapy appears to be the in situ hybridization, which should follow the new recommended algorithm of the ASCO/CAP guidelines in case of doubtful results. According to the evidence that the survival of HER-2-positive BC can be improved with the introduction of trastuzumab respect to the HER-2-negative counterpart, there is today less uncertainty about the curative role of anti-HER-2 therapy in very early disease.",

Cells infected with retrovirus expressing anti-Her-2/neu siRNA exhibit slower proliferation, increased apoptosis, increased G0/G1 arrest, and decreased tumor growth. Changes in cell cycle-associated factors included decreased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, pAkt, and cyclin D1 and increased levels of p27 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. Knockdown of Her-2/neu expression by siRNA is also associated with increased expression of the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 and decreased expression of the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor, suggesting that Her-2/neu stimulates tumor growth at least in part by regulating angiogenesis. siRNA-mediated gene silencing of Her-2/neu and increasing the expression of thrombospondin-1 may be a useful therapeutic strategy for Her-2/neu-over-expressing breast or ovarian cancer.",

While the value and direction of the treatment/HER2 interaction may vary, depending on the agents, dose, or schedule of drug administration, there is little disagreement that HER2 testing is an important part of breast cancer evaluation. In 1998, trastuzumab (Herceptin) was approved for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients by the Food and Drug Administration of the USA. Patients with abnormal HER2 in their breast cancer cells (generally 2 or 3+ with the HercepTest, overexpression by other immunohistochemical assays or amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] assay) have demonstrated the greatest response to trastuzumab treatment. It is unclear which test (method, reagent, cut-off points, etc.) is best to use to evaluate HER2 for this purpose because parallel testing of the same cancers from patients who received trastuzumab has only recently been initiated and the data are limited. It is widely believed that breast cancers without HER2 alterations will not be responsive to trastuzumab, although a clinical trial to test this specific hypothesis has not been initiated. There are also concerns that clonal heterogeneity for HER2 within a tumor, or between primary and metastatic cancer foci, may affect treatment response; yet we do not currently evaluate these parameters. Consensus regarding the best methods, reagents, or cut-off points to define HER2 status for determining trastuzumab responsivity has not yet been reached. HER2 testing for other prognostic or predictive purposes, e.g. to determine whether patients are likely to respond to other agents, such as dose-intensive doxorubicin, may be less.

However, a mechanistic relationship between AIB1/SRC-3 and HER2/neu in the development of breast cancer has not been shown. Here, we show that deletion of one allele of SRC-3 significantly delays Neu-induced mammary tumor development in mice. Homozygous deletion of SRC-3 in mice completely prevents Neu-induced tumor formation. By ages 3 to 4 months, Neu/SRC-3(+/-) mice exhibit a noticeable reduction in lateral side-bud formation, accompanied by reduced cellular levels of phosphorylated Neu compared with Neu/SRC-3(wt) mice. In Neu-induced tumors, high levels of SRC-3, phosphorylated Neu, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression are observed, accompanied by activation of the AKT and c-Jun NH(2) kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. In comparison, phosphorylated Neu, cyclin D1, and cyclin E are significantly decreased in Neu/SRC-3(+/-) tumors, proliferation is reduced, and AKT and JNK activation is barely detectable. Our data indicate that AIB1/SRC-3 is required for HER2/neu oncogenic activity and for the phosphorylation and activation of the HER2/neu receptor.

Interestingly, AE suppressed YB-1 expression through the downregulation of the intracellular integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTOR signaling pathway in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. In vivo study showed the positive result of antitumor activity of AE in nude mice injected with human HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. These findings suggest the possible application of AE in the treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer.",

Bilateral breast cancer was categorized as synchronous (within 3 months) or metachronous (diagnosed after 3 months of first cancer). SPSS was used for data analysis.;106 (2.5%) and 31 (0.7%) patients were diagnosed with metachronous and synchronous bilateral cancer. Women with bilateral cancer had more frequent postmenopause, HER-2 negativity, and advanced disease than in patients with unilateral cancer. Young age at diagnosis, invasive lobular carcinoma, ER/PR negativity, HER-2 positivity, radiation, large tumor size (T > 5 cm), and stage III disease of the first cancer were risk factors for contralateral cancer. The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 76 and 83% for unilateral cancer, while 32 and 72% for bilateral cancer (P = 0.000 for both).;Bilateral cancer was associated with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival than unilateral cancer.

There is a group of breast cancers lacking ER and HER2, but it is not fully understood. Treatment for these patients is limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The purpose of present study is to examine ER(-)/HER2(-) breast cancers, with a particular focus on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a target molecule for which novel medicines have been recently developed for other organ cancers, however biological significance in breast cancer is not yet well demonstrated. Breast cancer specimens (n=58) were categorized into four groups: i) ER(+)/HER2(-) (51.7%); ii) ER(+)/HER2(+) (8.6%); iii) ER(-)/HER2(+) (20.7%); and iv) ER(-)/HER2(-) (19.0%). They were immunohistochemically (IHC) examined using antibodies for EGFR, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)alpha, PDGFRbeta, parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor, Ki-67, cyclinD1, p53, and vimentin. The Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was highest in ER(-)/HER2(-) (36.5%), and decreased in order from ER(-)/HER2(+) (31.4%), ER(+)/HER2(+) (17.7%), to (ER(+)/HER2(-) (15.9%) (p=0.001). EGFR, p53 and vimentin were highly expressed in ER(-)/HER2(-) breast cancer cells (p<0.01). CyclinD1 was inversely expressed to Ki-67 LI (p<0.001). Gene amplification of EGFR was examined by two in situ hybridization techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in serial sections to IHC. Only 1 of 14 EGFR-positive breast cancers showed gene amplification at low levels by CISH. Overall, the ER(-)/HER2(-) breast cancer showed the highest Ki-67 LI, the most frequent expression of EGFR, p53 and vimentin, as well as the lowest expression of cyclinD1. It is unlikely that gene amplification contributes to EGFR expression. ER(-)/HER2(-) breast cancers have potential in the development of novel therapeutics, including targeted medicines.",

While the role of protein tyrosine kinases has been examined extensively in human breast tumorigenesis, the role of PTPases in this process is virtually unknown. To address this issue, an activated neu oncogene was introduced into an immortalized nontumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line (184B5). This resulted in a substantial increase in P185neu expression, which led to the formation of progressively growing carcinomas after such cells were inoculated into athymic nude mice. Importantly, a striking increase in the expression of specific PTPases, LAR and PTP1B, was observed in 3 independently neu transformed cell lines and their derived tumors. This elevation was verified at both the mRNA and protein levels. TC-PTP PTPase expression was only slightly increased in these neu transformed cells, and no expression of CD45 PTPase was observed. The level of neu expression, as well as the differential expression between P185neu and LAR/PTP1B, directly correlated with tumorigenicity. Furthermore, rat mammary carcinomas with elevated neu expression (neu-induced) also had sharply elevated LAR-PTPase expression when compared to rat mammary carcinomas with little or no neu expression (7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene induced); the level of expression of LAR PTPase was directly correlated with the level of neu expression. Thus, our results provide the first evidence that, in human breast carcinoma cells and in rat mammary carcinomas that have an induced increase in neu expression, a consistent and substantial increase in the expression of specific PTPases occurs. The relationship between P185neu-protein tyrosine kinase expression and specific PTPase expression may play a critical role in human breast tumorigenesis.",

Serum samples were collected from 58 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma before first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease, and the levels of circulating HER2 ECD were measured using an enzyme immunoassay. Immunohistochemistry with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody CB11 was used to assess the overexpression of HER2 in the primary tumors. When 450 fmol/ml was used as a cutoff, 24 cases (41%) had elevated HER2 ECD levels. Elevated levels of circulating HER2 ECD were associated with the expression of HER2 in the primary tumor tissue and with the metastatic tumor burden (evaluated with the marker CA 15-3; P = 0.032 and P = 0.002, respectively) but not with variables such as menopausal status, stage at diagnosis, previous adjuvant therapy, or the number of metastatic sites. The levels of circulating HER2 ECD correlated inversely with the response to treatment. The probability of obtaining a complete response to chemotherapy was significantly lower (P = 0.021) in patients with elevated HER2 ECD levels (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0-13%) compared with patients with nonelevated HER2 (26%; 95% confidence interval, 12-45%). In addition, the duration of clinical response was significantly shorter in patients with elevated HER2 ECD, compared with the cases with nonelevated HER2 (7.5 versus 11 months; P = 0.035). In conclusion, elevated levels of circulating HER2 ECD in patients with metastatic breast cancer correlate with reduced efficacy of a paclitaxel-doxorubicin chemotherapy combination. We suggest that the poor response rate associated with HER2 expression in advanced breast cancer may not be reversed by aggressive chemotherapy alone.",

Immunohistochemistry using PN2A demonstrated that Neu actively signals in the tumors of Neu transgenic mice.

Gene coexpression modules of three key biological processes in breast cancer (namely, proliferation, estrogen receptor [ER], and HER2 signaling) were used to dissect the role of constituent genes of nine prognostic signatures.;Using a meta-analytical approach, we consolidated the signatures associated with ER signaling, ERBB2 amplification, and proliferation. Previously published expression-based nomenclature of breast cancer 'intrinsic' subtypes can be mapped to the three modules, namely, the ER-/HER2- (basal-like), the HER2+ (HER2-like), and the low- and high-proliferation ER+/HER2- subtypes (luminal A and B). We showed that all nine prognostic signatures exhibited a similar prognostic performance in the entire dataset. Their prognostic abilities are due mostly to the detection of proliferation activity. Although ER- status (basal-like) and ERBB2+ expression status correspond to bad outcome, they seem to act through elevated expression of proliferation genes and thus contain only indirect information about prognosis. Clinical variables measuring the extent of tumor progression, such as tumor size and nodal status, still add independent prognostic information to proliferation genes.;This meta-analysis unifies various results of previous gene expression studies in breast cancer.

Its extracellular domain (ECD) is frequently cleaved by protease(s) in HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer patients, rendering the remaining membrane-bound portion (p95) a constitutively activated kinase. The presence of both serum ECD and cellular p95 protein has been linked to poor clinical outcome as well as reduced effectiveness of some therapeutic treatments. We have identified a series of potent, selective small molecule inhibitors of ADAM proteases, exemplified here by INCB003619, and demonstrate that these inhibitors effectively block HER-2 cleavage in HER-2 overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines. Intriguingly, when used in combination, INCB003619 dramatically enhances the antiproliferative activity of suboptimal doses of the anti-HER-2 antibody, trastuzumab, in HER-2 overexpressing/shedding breast cancer cell lines, accompanied by reduced ERK and AKT phosphorylation. Furthermore, INCB003619, in combination with trastuzumab, augments the pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. Consistent with these in vitro data, INCB003619 reduces serum ECD levels and enhances the antitumor effect of trastuzumab in a xenograft tumor model derived from the HER-2 overexpressing BT-474 breast cancer cell line.

Here, we investigated whether rVP1 exhibits any inhibitory effects on migration/metastasis and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), a well-known biomarker for poor prognosis of breast cancer. The effects of rVP1 on cancer cell migration/invasion and metastasis were evaluated using Transwell migration assay and animal cancer models of metastasis. Western blotting, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining techniques were used to investigate the effects of rVP1 on HER-2 and signal transduction mediators. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of rVP1-induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition and significantly suppressed AP-2α and HER-2 expression as well as the migration and invasion of a variety of breast cancer cell lines in a β1-integrin-dependent manner in vitro. Gross and histopathologic examinations showed that rVP1 also suppressed metastasis of several breast cancer cell lines, including HER-2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells to lung, liver, or peripheral lymph node in orthotopic allograft/xenograft murine models. In addition, rVP1 significantly prolonged survival in breast cancer-bearing mice. Notably, no apparent side effects of rVP1 were detected, as shown by normal complete blood count levels and serum biochemistry profiles, including AST, ALT, BUN, and creatine. This study demonstrates that rVP1 suppresses the migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells via binding to β1 integrin receptor and down-regulation of AP-2α and HER-2 expression. The effectiveness of rVP1 on inhibiting migration/metastasis of breast cancer and HER-2 expression suggests that it may be suitable for serving as potential therapeutics for metastatic breast cancer particularly HER-2-overexpressing cancer.",

A key downstream metabolic target of Ras and Akt is the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 isozyme (PFKFB3), whose product, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP), is a potent allosteric activator of a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1). We postulate that PFKFB3 may be regulated by HER2 and contribute to HER2-driven tumorigenicity.;Immunohistochemistry and Kaplan-Meier analysis of HER2+ patient samples investigated the relevance of PFKFB3 in HER2+ breast cancer. In vitro genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 was utilized to determine effects on HER2+ breast cancer cells, while HER2 antagonist treatment assessed the mechanistic regulation on PFKFB3 expression and glucose metabolism. Administration of a PFKFB3 inhibitor in a HER2-driven transgenic breast cancer model evaluated this potential therapeutic approach in vivo.;PFKFB3 is elevated in human HER2+ breast cancer and high PFKFB3 transcript correlated with poorer progression-free (PFS) and distant metastatic-free (DFMS) survival.

Despite decades of promising preclinical and clinical research, no vaccine is currently available for breast cancer patients. Preclinical research has much to do with this failure, as early mouse models of mammary carcinoma did not mirror the molecular, cellular, antigenic and immunological features of human breast cancer. The advent of HER-2 transgenic mice gave impulse to a new generation of cell and DNA vaccines against mammary carcinoma, that in turn led to the definition of significant antigenic (oncoantigens) and cellular (cancer-initiating cells, preneoplastic lesions, incipient metastases) targets. Future preclinical developments will include the discovery of novel oncoantigens in HER-2-negative mammary carcinoma and the targeting of activated HER-2 molecular variants. Translation to clinically effective vaccines will be fostered not only by new preclinical model systems, but also by the possibility to conduct veterinary vaccination trials in companion animals. ",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of serum HER2, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carcinoma antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) for the detection of disease recurrence in postoperative breast cancer patients with a primary HER2-positive tumor.;Serial measurements were taken of serum HER2, CEA, and CA 15-3 levels in patients with primary invasive HER2-positive breast cancer who underwent curative surgical treatment between January 2008 and December 2010. Following treatment, serum HER2 levels were monitored every 6 months using a chemiluminescence immunoassay.;Overall, 264 patients were analyzed in this retrospective study. The median follow-up period was 27.7 months, and 24 patients relapsed during follow-up. The sensitivity of serum HER2, CEA, and CA 15-3 for the detection of disease recurrence was 37.5%, 25.1%, and 12.5%, respectively. Sensitivity increased to 45.8% when all three tumor markers were combined in the analysis.

Five hundred and three cases of breast invasive ductal carcinoma were selected to analyse the HER-2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (HercepTest, Dako).

FISH performed on equivocal cases demonstrated HER-2 amplification in 11/60 tumours (18%). IHC and FISH together showed HER-2 overexpression/gene amplification in 21% of breast invasive carcinomas. Immunohistochemical determination of HER-2 status represents an easy and standardized method that (in contrast to FISH) can be performed in all pathology laboratories without need of any special microscope and enabling to check the morphologic features of the cells analysed.

We retrospectively analyzed tumors of 450 HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and 1 year of trastuzumab. HR-/HER2+ tumors showed higher nuclear grade, less tubule formation, higher histologic grade, frequent apocrine features, diffuse and abundant lymphocytic infiltration, strong HER2 immunohistochemical staining (3+), higher average HER2 copy number and HER2/CEP17 ratio, the absence of HER2 genetic heterogeneity, and greater p53 expression than HR+/HER2+ tumors. An inverse correlation was observed between estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor Allred score and average HER2 copy number or HER2/CEP17 ratio. The percentage of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) within the tumor was negatively correlated with ER Allred score, but positively correlated with average HER2 copy number and HER2/CEP17 ratio. Pathologic tumor size and DCIS percentage also showed a significant inverse correlation. Ratio of metastatic to total examined lymph node number was significantly correlated with average HER2 copy number and HER2/CEP17 ratio.

Next, we studied if leptin/ObR can coexist with HER2 in breast cancer tissues, and if presence of these two systems correlates with specific clinicopathological features.;Expression of ObR, HER2, phospho-HER2 was assessed by immunoblotting. Physical interactions between ObR and HER2 were probed by immunoprecipitation and fluorescent immunostaining.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on a tissue microarray containing samples from 130 pure DCIS and 159 DCIS associated with invasive breast cancer. Of the latter patients, we analyzed the intraductal and invasive components separately. In addition, lymph node metastases of 23 patients with invasive carcinoma were included.

This applied also to the corresponding lymph node metastases. Our results indicate no significant differences between the gene amplification status of DCIS and invasive breast cancer concerning HER2, ESR1, CCND1, and MYC.

A synergistic interaction between trastuzumab in combination with CDDP (paclitaxel or vincristine) was obtained in MCF-7/HRG cells. Trastuzumab prevented activation of the antiapoptotic and proliferative cascades and inhibited HRG-induced Her-2/3 phosphorylation. CDDP efficacy was enhanced by trastuzumab in cells expressing endogenously high levels of HRG. Conversely, trastuzumab coexposure was ineffective in enhancing chemotherapy efficacy in cells that did not secrete HRG, such as MCF-7 cells overexpressing a structural mutated HRG isoform. Therefore, trastuzumab-induced REC, in the absence of Her-2 overexpression, occurs through the kinase activity of Her-2/3. Interestingly, HRG expression in tumor biopsies from invasive breast carcinomas (n = 189) revealed that, whereas the minority (12%) of Her-2 positive tumors (n = 60; 32%) demonstrated Her-2 phosphorylation, the majority (67%) of HRG-overexpressing and Her-2 tumors (n = 57; 30%) were in active Her-2 status.;We demonstrate that assessment of HRG expression and Her-2 activation define a particular breast cancer patient population for which trastuzumab plus CDDP or taxol are extremely efficient without Her-2 overexpression.",

Alu and long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) are non-coding genomic repetitive sequences and methylation of these elements can be used as a surrogate marker for genome-wide methylation status. This study was designed to evaluate the changes of Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation during breast cancer progression from normal to pre-invasive lesions and invasive breast cancer (IBC), and their relationship with characteristics of IBC. We analyzed the methylation status of Alu and LINE-1 in 145 cases of breast samples including normal breast tissue, atypical ductal hyperplasia/flat epithelial atypia (ADH/FEA), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IBC, and another set of 129 cases of IBC by pyrosequencing. Alu methylation showed no significant changes during multistep progression of breast cancer, although it tended to decrease during the transition from DCIS to IBC. In contrast, LINE-1 methylation significantly decreased from normal to ADH/FEA, while it was similar in ADH/FEA, DCIS and IBC. In IBC, Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status, and LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with negative ER status, ERBB2 (HER2) amplification and p53 overexpression. Alu and LINE-1 methylation status was significantly different between breast cancer subtypes, and the HER2 enriched subtype had lowest methylation levels. In survival analyses, low Alu methylation status tended to be associated with poor disease-free survival of the patients. Our findings suggest that LINE-1 hypomethylation is an early event and Alu hypomethylation is probably a late event during breast cancer progression, and prominent hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 in HER2 enriched subtype may be related to chromosomal instability of this specific subtype.

However, not all cells that express erbB2 respond to heregulin, indicating that other components besides erbB2 may be required for heregulin binding. Cells that are transfected with the closely related receptor, erbB3, display a single class of lower affinity heregulin binding sites than has been previously observed on breast carcinoma cell lines. Little or no stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to heregulin occurs in cells that are transfected with erbB3 alone. Transfection of cells with erbB3 and erbB2 reconstitutes a higher affinity binding receptor, which is also capable of generating a tyrosine phosphorylation signal in response to heregulin. A monoclonal antibody to erbB2 will inhibit heregulin activation of tyrosine phosphorylation and binding in cells transfected with both receptors but not with erbB3 alone. In cells expressing erbB2 and erbB3, both proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon interaction with heregulin. Direct interaction between heregulin and the two proteins was demonstrated by chemical cross-linking experiments using 125I-heregulin followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for erbB2 or erbB3.",

Overexpression in breast cancer correlates with poor patient prognosis, and visualization of HER-2 expression might provide valuable diagnostic information influencing patient management. We have previously described the generation of a new type of affinity ligand, a 58-amino-acid affibody (Z(HER2:4)) with specific binding to HER-2. In order to benefit from avidity effects, we have created a bivalent form of the affibody ligand, (Z(HER2:4))2. The monovalent and bivalent ligands were compared in various assays. The new bivalent affibody has a molecular weight of 15.6 kDa and an apparent affinity (K(D)) against HER-2 of 3 nM. After radioiodination, using the linker molecule N-succinimidyl p-(trimethylstannyl) benzoate (SPMB), in vitro binding assays showed specific binding to HER-2 overexpressing cells. Internalization of 125I was shown after delivery with both the monovalent and the bivalent affibody. The cellular retention of 125I was longer after delivery with the bivalent affibody when compared to delivery with the monovalent affibody. With approximately the same affinity as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) but only one tenth of the size, this new bivalent molecule is a promising candidate for radionuclide-based detection of HER-2 expression in tumors. 125I was used in this study as a surrogate marker for the diagnostically relevant radioisotopes 123I for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/gamma-camera imaging and 124I for positron emission tomography (PET).",

IHC was performed by using mouse monoclonal antibody to the intracellular domain of HER-2/neu protein. Each slide was scored in a blinded fashion by two pathologists according to the manufacturer's recommended criteria. FISH analysis was performed on paraffin embedded breast tumour tissue sections. The polysomy for centromere 17 (Spec green signal) was read as green signals less than 4 as moderate polysomy, and more than 4 as highly polysomy.;Thirty of the 90 patients had negative results by IHC and FISH. Of the 28 patients with the score of 2+ by IHC, 20 were FISH positive for HER-2/neu gene amplification, three were FISH negative and five patients showed equivocal (1.8-2.2) results by FISH. These five cases were retested for IHC and FISH on different paraffin embedded tissue blocks, and all five were found positive for HER-2/neu gene amplification. Twenty five patients with the score of 3+ by IHC were FISH positive for HER-2/neu gene amplification (>2.2). Seven cases with the score of 3+ by IHC were FISH negative for HER-2/neu gene amplification (>2.2), and showed polysomy of chromosome number 17 high polysomy > 4.;Our results indicated that HER-2/neu status by FISH should be performed in all cases of breast tumour with a 2+ score by IHC. Cases demonstrating a 3+ score by IHC may be subjected to FISH to rule out polysomy of chromosome 17 which could be falsely interpreted as HER-2/neu overexpression by IHC analysis.

Our data showed that (i) AdVHER2-infected DC(HER-2) expressed HER-2/neu by Western blot and flow cytometric analysis, and (ii) vaccination of mice with DC(HER-2) induced HER-2/neu-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses, but protected only 25% of vaccinated mice from challenge of 3 x 10(5) MCA26/HER-2 tumor cells. Further, to enhance the efficacy of DC(HER-2) vaccine, we coinfected DCs with both AdVHER-2 and AdVTNF-alpha. The infected DCs (DC(HER-2/TNF-alpha)) displayed the expression of both HER-2/neu and TNF-alpha by flow cytometric and ELISA analysis. We next investigated whether DC(HER-2/TNF-alpha) could induce stronger HER-2/neu-specific immune responses. We found that DC(HER-2/TNF-alpha) displayed up-regulation of immunologically important CD40, CD86, and ICAM-I molecules compared with DC(HER-2), indicating that the former ones are more mature forms of DCs. Vaccination of DC(HER-2/TNF-alpha) induced stronger allogeneic T-cell proliferation and 36% enhanced HER-2/neu-specific T-cell responses in vitro than DC(HER-2) cells. More importantly, it stimulated the significant anti-HER-2/neu immunity in vivo, which protected 8/8 mice from challenge of 3 x 10(5) MCA26/HER-2 tumor cells. Therefore, DCs genetically engineered to express both the tumor antigen and cytokines such as TNF-alpha as an immunoadjuvant are likely to represent a new direction in DC vaccine of cancer.",

Therefore, the encoded surface glycoprotein represents an attractive target for cancer immunotherapies. Furthermore, the extracellular domain of HER-2/neu is released from the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage. In the present experiments, we investigated the potential biologic effects of soluble HER-2/neu with particular emphasis on its interaction with anti-HER-2/neu antibodies. A monoclonal antibody specific for the extracellular domain of HER-2/neu dose dependently inhibited the proliferation of highly HER-2/neu-expressing SK-BR-3 and BT-474 breast cancer cells but had no effect on the proliferation of weakly to moderately HER-2/neu-expressing MCF-7, HBL-100 and ZR-75-1 breast cells. Addition of SK-BR-3 or BT-474 cell supernatants with high concentrations of soluble HER-2/neu led to a neutralization of anti-HER-2/neu antibody-mediated inhibition of proliferation due to a binding of soluble HER-2/neu by the antibody, which could be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the ability of anti-HER-2/neu antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by lymphokine-activated killer cells was assessed. Cytolysis of SK-BR-3 tumor cells was increased significantly in the presence of anti-HER-2/neu antibodies. Similar to the proliferation inhibition, ADCC was neutralized by addition of soluble HER-2/neu-containing supernatants.

This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected database. Variables evaluated for the analysis of prognostic significance included tumor size, axillary lymph node status, histological grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status and HER-2 oncogene expression. NPI was calculated from tumor size, lymph node status and histological grade. In univariate analysis, tumor size, axillary lymph node status, distant metastasis status, HER-2 oncogene overexpression and NPI score were found to be significant variables.

HER-2 testing and targeted therapy now represents a critical cornerstone in the management of breast cancer. The objectives of the current study were to determine the frequency and prognostic significance of HER-3 over-expression and HER-4 over-expression by invasive breast cancer.;Tissue microarrays were constructed using clinically annotated formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 4046 patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma with a median 12.5 years of follow-up. Type 1 growth factor receptor family members HER-1, HER-2, HER-3, and HER-4 expression levels were determined by immunohistochemistry, and HER-2 status was further resolved by fluorescent in-situ hybridization. The study cohort was randomly divided and analyzed as a core data set and a validation data set.;HER-3 over-expression was identified in 10.0% of tumors and was a significant marker of reduced patient breast cancer-specific survival on univariate analysis (P = 1.32 x 10(-5)). Furthermore, in tumors with normal expression levels of HER-1 and HER-2, the overexpression of HER-3 had a significant negative prognostic effect on disease-specific survival (HR: 1.541, 95% CI: 1.166-2.036, P = 2.37 x 10(-3)) independent of patient age at diagnosis, Estrogen receptor status, tumor grade, tumor size, nodal status, and the presence of lymphatic or vascular invasion by cancer. HER-4 overexpression was identified in 78.2% of breast cancers and was not a significant marker of patient survival (P = 0.214). Results of all statistical tests were positively confirmed in the validation data set analysis.;HER-3 status is an important prognostic marker of disease-specific survival in patients with invasive breast cancer. Accordingly, evaluation of the HER-3 expression level may identify a subset of patients with a poor disease prognosis, and who could undergo further evaluation for the efficacy of HER-3 targeted anticancer agents.",

Although amplification of HER2, C-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 has been reported in breast cancers, their role in the progression of in situ to invasive breast carcinoma is unclear. To investigate this question we compared the amplification frequencies of these genes in pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), DCIS associated with invasive carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma.;We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization of the selected genes on tissue microarrays composed of 179 pure DCIS and 438 invasive carcinomas. Two hundred and sixteen of the latter had DCIS components, and in those cases we compared gene amplification in the intraductal and invasive components of each carcinoma.;The rate of amplification of FGFR1 was higher in invasive carcinomas than in the pure DCIS, but the opposite was true for HER2 amplification. These findings applied consistently to high-grade tumors, but not to low/intermediate-grade tumors. The amplification status of HER2, C-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 was generally similar in the matched invasive and DCIS components of the same tumors. However, FGFR1 amplification was more common in the invasive components than in the DCIS components. In survival analyses, FGFR1 amplification was found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-free survival for all patients with invasive carcinoma and for the hormone receptor-positive subgroup.;Amplification of HER2, C-MYC and CCND1 seems to play a role in the early development of breast cancer, but not in its progression. However, the increased frequency of FGFR1 amplification in invasive carcinomas compared with pure DCIS and in the invasive components of individual tumors, and its association with decreased disease-free survival, suggests a role for FGFR1 amplification in the progression of breast cancer including in situ-to-invasive transition, as well as initiation.",

It has been suggested that overexpression and even amplification of ERBB2 may play a role in the development of prostate cancer. Here, we have analyzed gene copy number and expression of the ERBB2 gene in both androgen-dependent primary and metastatic tumors, as well as recurrent hormone-refractory tumors. The expression levels were compared to the expression of ERBB2 in breast cancers with or without ERBB2 gene amplification. Of 126 prostate tumors, chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) revealed only 1 case containing borderline (six to eight copies) amplifications of ERBB2. This hormone-refractory tumor, however, did not express ERBB2 protein. Immunohistochemical staining of ERBB2 protein was negative (0 or 1+ intensity) in all prostate samples (n = 124) analyzed. To quantitate the level of ERBB2 mRNA expression in prostate tumors (n = 34) and cell lines (n = 3), as well as in breast tumors (n = 30) and cell lines (n = 16), real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (LightCycler) methodology was used. The expression level was similar in all prostate tumor types and corresponded to the level of expression in breast carcinomas without ERBB2 amplification. Breast tumors with ERBB2 amplification expressed, on average, approximately 20 times (P < 0.001) higher mRNA levels than prostate tumors or breast carcinomas without the gene amplification. In conclusion, the expression of ERBB2 in prostate cancer is relatively low, and is not altered during disease progression. Thus, it is unlikely that treatment modalities relying on the overexpression of ERBB2 gene will be useful in treating prostate cancer.",

Basal-like breast carcinoma (BLC) has a triple negative phenotype, that is, the subtype lacks the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It has been recently reported that CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein, is a new breast myoepithelial marker. In the present study CD109 expression was investigated in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) of the breast on immunohistochemistry. Eighty-eight formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast carcinoma sections were immunostained with anti-CD109, anti-cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), anti-calponin, anti-vimentin and anti-p63 antibodies. CD109 expression was detected in 18 of 30 basal-like breast carcinomas (BLC) but not in other types of 53 IDC (non-BLC) that were positive for ER, PgR and/or HER2. The percentage of CD109-positive tissues (60%) in BLC was similar to that of CK5/6 (63%) and higher than that of other myoepithelial markers including p63 (23%), calponin (33%) and vimentin (33%). Statistical analysis indicated that the CD109-positive group in BLC, but not the CK5/6-positive group in BLC, was associated with reduced fat invasion (P < 0.05).

The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical significance of GRB7 protein expression in human breast cancer. Western blotting analysis of protein extracts from 563 annotated frozen breast tumors was performed. Expression status of GRB7 and HER-2 was correlated with clinical covariates and outcomes. Cox proportional hazards were used to identify factors associated with breast cancer-free interval. The median follow-up was 71 months. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant (two-sided). A discrepancy between HER-2 and GRB7 protein over-expression was observed. GRB7 protein over-expression was associated with negative estrogen and progesterone receptor status, higher tumor grade, larger primary tumor size, (more) axillary lymph node involvement, higher clinical stage, and shortened breast cancer-free interval. HER-2 protein over-expression was associated only with higher tumor grade. Multi-variate analysis revealed that GRB7 protein over-expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor for breast cancer-free interval (hazard ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.67; P = 0.024).

Our aim was to explore the effects of ZD1839 in breast cancer cell lines expressing different levels of EGFR and the closely related HER2 receptor.;We studied the growth-inhibitory effects of ZD1839 in a series of breast carcinoma cell lines. In HER2-overexpressing BT-474 breast cancer cells, we studied the effects of ZD1839 on cell growth and heterodimerization of receptors under basal and ligand-stimulated conditions.;ZD1839 was an equally potent inhibitor of growth in breast cancer cells expressing high levels of EGFR and HER2. In BT-474 breast cancer cells, ZD1839 abolished EGF- and heregulin-induced activation of ErbB receptors and downstream signaling molecules. Because ZD1839 does not inhibit the HER2 tyrosine kinase in vitro, and because heregulin is a ligand that activates HER2 by binding to HER3 and HER4 but does not bind to the EGFR, our findings suggested that ZD1839 interfered with HER2 function in intact cells. Searching for mechanisms, we report that ZD1839 induces the formation of inactive unphosphorylated EGFR/HER2 and EGFR/HER3 heterodimers. Furthermore, ZD1839 completely abolishes basal and heregulin-induced formation of active phosphorylated HER2/HER3 heterodimers.;ZD1839 inhibits the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, possibly by sequestration of HER2 and HER3 receptors in an inactive heterodimer configuration with the EGFR.

Next to immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate HER2 protein overexpression, a second line gene amplification test is generally deemed necessary for cases with equivocal protein expression. Recently, a new PCR based test, called Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), was introduced as a simple and quick method to assess HER-2/neu gene amplification status in invasive breast cancer. MLPA was previously shown to correlate well with IHC and in situ hybridization (ISH), but a low tumor percentage in the tissue tested could negatively affect the accuracy of MLPA results.;To examine this, MLPA was repeated in 42 patients after serial H&E section guided manual dissection with a scalpel and after laser microdissection of the tumor.;Both dissection techniques led to higher HER2 gene copy number ratios and thereby made MLPA more quantitative. Concordance between MLPA and ISH improved from 61% to 84% after manual microdissection and to 90% after laser microdissection.;Manual and laser microdissection similarly increase the dynamic range of MLPA copy number ratios which is a technical advantage. As clinically a dichotomization between normal and amplified suffices and MLPA is relatively unsensitive to tumor content, microdissection before MLPA may not be routinely necessary but may be advisable in case of very low tumor content (<or=30%), when MLPA results are equivocal, or when extensive ductal carcinoma in situ is present. Since differences between manual and laser microdissection were small, less time consuming manual microdissection appears to be sufficient.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Understanding the signaling differences that distinguish human HER2-amplified (HER2-positive (HER2+)) breast cancers from other breast cancer subtypes may help to identify protein drug targets for the specific treatment of HER2+ breast cancers. We performed two kinome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens on five HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, seven breast cancer cell lines in which HER2 was not amplified and two normal breast cell lines. To pinpoint the main kinases driving HER2 signaling, we performed a comprehensive siRNA screen that identified loss of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer as having the most prominent inhibitory effect on the growth of HER2+ breast cancer cells. In a second siRNA screen focused on identifying genes that could sensitize HER2+ cells to trastuzumab treatment, we found that loss of signaling members downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) potentiated the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab. Loss of HER2 and HER3, as well as proteins involved in mitogenic and environmental stress pathways inhibited the proliferation of HER2+ cells only in the absence of trastuzumab, suggesting that these pathways are inhibited by trastuzumab treatment. Loss of essential G2/M cell cycle mediators or proteins involved in vesicle organization exerted inhibitory effects on HER2+ cell growth that were unaffected by trastuzumab. Furthermore, the use of a sensitization index (SI) identified targeting the PI3K pathway to sensitize to trastuzumab treatment. Antagonism using the SI identified MYO3A, MYO3B and MPZL1 as antagonizers to trastuzumab treatment among HER2+ cell lines. Our results suggest that the dimerization partners of HER2 are important for determining the activation of downstream proliferation pathways. Understanding the complex layers of signaling triggered downstream of HER2 homodimers and heterodimers will facilitate the selection of better targets for combination therapies intended to treat HER2+ breast cancers.

It is established that treatment with Herceptin leads to selective overexpression and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src which further contributes to oncogenesis in Herceptin resistant and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Here, we show a co-regulated upregulation in the expression of Annexin A2 (AnxA2), a known substrate of Src and one of the regulators of EGFR receptor endocytosis, in Herceptin resistant and Her-2 negative breast cancer. Immunohistochemical expression analysis revealed a reciprocal regulation between Her-2 and AnxA2 in breast cancer clinical samples as well as in cell lines as confirmed by protein and RNA analysis. The siRNA and Herceptin mediated downregulation/inhibition of Her-2 in Her-2 amplified cells induced AnxA2 expression and membrane translocation. In this study we report a possible involvement of AnxA2 in maintaining constitutively activated EGFR downstream signaling intermediates and hence in cell proliferation, migration and viability. This effect was consistent in Herceptin resistant JIMT-1 cells as well as in Her-2 negative breast cancer. The siRNA mediated AnxA2 downregulation leads to increased apoptosis, decreased cell viability and migration. Our studies further indicate the role of AnxA2 in EGFR-Src membrane bound signaling complex and ligand induced activation of downstream signaling pathways.

Biologically this cancer subtype is characterized by an aggressive clinical course (often spread to regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis), and after successful treatment high risk of recurrence. Deregulation of the cell cycle is the basis for cancer aggressiveness. The RB protein is one of the key regulators of the cell cycle. There are only a few published studies on the expression and localization of RB protein in the cells of HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the expression and localization of RB protein in HER2-positive breast cancers compared to breast cancers showing no expression of HER2. We used 50 tissue samples from HER2 positive breast cancer and 21 tissue samples derived from patients with HER2 negative breast cancer. The RB protein expression was measured by immunohistochemical techniques in tissue microarray format. Cytoplasmic RB expression was observed in 29 out of 50 (58%) HER2 positive breast cancers. In this group only cytoplasmic expression was observed. There was no case with nuclear expression. In contrast, in the HER2-negative breast cancer control group, in no case RB expression was observed in the cytoplasm (0/21, 0%). All 21 samples (100%) showed expression of RB protein in the nucleus (p < 0.0001). We can speculate that lack of expression suggests alternative mechanisms in the development of HER2 positive breast cancer. We hypothesize that HER2 overexpression is in some way associated with active transport of RB protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This may be an indirect mechanism of inactivation of tumor suppressor protein in breast cancer exhibiting overexpression of HER2.",

Only patients with tumors which over express Her2 as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory FISH+ result, or IHC 3+, determined by an accurate and validated assay are eligible for trastuzumab therapy. However, testing of Her2 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) differs from breast cancer in core aspects: 1. IHC2+/3+ is scored even though membranous staining is incomplete if membrane staining is clearly detectable even at low magnification (2.5x/5x, 3+) or medium magnification (10x/20x, 2+). 2. Additionally, membrane staining at the appropriate intensity found in at least 10% of tumor cells is restricted to resection specimens. Evaluation of Her2 in situ hybridization (ISH) is similar to breast cancer with ratio values of > or =2.0 indicating Her2 gene amplification. Taking these modifications into account and defining the HER2 positive subgroup as IHC 3+ and IHC2+/FISH+, approximately 16% of gastric cancers are considered Her2 positive, affecting mainly tumor regions with intestinal (gland forming) type carcinoma.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary breast cancers from 184 women (mean age, 60 years) were stained for topo II by automated immunohistochemistry. A topo II expression index (TI) was determined by counting the number of positive cells per high-power field and calculating an overall mean number of positive cells per high-power field. Tumors with a TI of more than 1 were considered positive, and those with a TI of 1 or less were considered negative. A cell proliferation index was determine d by automated immunohistochemistry using the MIB-1 antibody in an identical technique. HER-2/neu gene amplification (HER-2 amp) was determined by automated fluorescence in situ hybridization using the Ventana unique sequence probe. Fifty-nine (32%) of the tumors had a TI greater than 1. On univariate analysis, increased topo II expression correlated with decreased patient survival (p = .001), advanced tumor stage (p = .034), lymph node metastasis (p = .018), and HER-2 amp (p = .016). Tumor stage (p < .0001), node-positive status (p < .0001), tumor grade (p = .025), HER-2 amp (p < .0001), and MIB-1 overexpression (p = .002) also correlated with survival on univariate analysis.

On multivariate analysis, stage (p < .0001), lymph node metastasis (p < .0001), and tumor grade (p = .002) all independently predicted disease-related death.

Another patient with the S310F mutation had an apocrine carcinoma with seven lymph nodes positive for metastasis, classified as HER2 3+ by the HercepTest, but which was FISH-negative, as well as ER-negative and PgR-negative. Both patients had received adjuvant single-agent trastuzumab therapy, and had no local recurrence or distant metastasis for five and three years after surgery, respectively.;Our data show that HER2 mutations are rare in HER2-positive Japanese breast cancer patients.

We performed tissue microarray (TMA) analysis of 425 breast cancer tissues collected during operation. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to measure expression of YKL-40 and several breast cancer biomarkers, such as aldehyde dehyadrogenase1, TGF-beta, and Gli-1 as well as hormonal receptor and Her-2/neu status. Statistical analysis of the relationship of YKL-40 expression with clinicopathological characteristics was performed for 390 TMA samples. YKL-40 was expressed to varying degrees in 84.9% of breast cancer tissues. YKL-40 expression was correlated with estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negativity and was positively correlated with TGF-beta and Gli-1 expression. Strong YKL-40 expression was associated with a larger proportion of Her-2/neu-enriched and basal-like tumors.

T regulatory cell (Treg) suppression of tumor-specific T cells is one barrier to effective immunization. A second mechanism is the deletion of high avidity tumor-specific T cells, which leaves a less effective low avidity tumor specific T cell repertoire available for activation by vaccines. Treg depleting agents including low dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) and antibodies that deplete CD25-expressing Tregs have been used with limited success to enhance the potency of tumor-specific vaccines. In addition, few studies have evaluated mechanisms that activate low avidity cancer antigen-specific T cells. Therefore, we developed high and low avidity HER-2/neu-specific TCR transgenic mouse colonies specific for the same HER-2/neu epitope to define the tolerance mechanisms that specifically affect high versus low avidity tumor-specific T cells.;High and low avidity CD8(+) T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice specific for the breast cancer antigen HER-2/neu (neu) were developed to provide a purified source of naïve, tumor-specific T cells that can be used to study tolerance mechanisms. Adoptive transfer studies into tolerant FVB/N-derived HER-2/neu transgenic (neu-N) mice demonstrated that high avidity, but not low avidity, neu-specific T cells are inhibited by Tregs as the dominant tolerizing mechanism. High avidity T cells persisted, produced IFNγ, trafficked into tumors, and lysed tumors after adoptive transfer into mice treated with a neu-specific vaccine and low dose Cy to deplete Tregs. Analysis of Treg subsets revealed a Cy-sensitive CD4(+)Foxp3(+)CD25(low) tumor-seeking migratory phenotype, characteristic of effector/memory Tregs, and capable of high avidity T cell suppression.;Depletion of CD25(low) Tregs allows activation of tumor-clearing high avidity T cells. Thus, the development of agents that specifically deplete Treg subsets should translate into more effective immunotherapies while avoiding autoimmunity.",

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is over expressed in approximately 20-30 % of breast cancer tumors and also in a lot of other human cancer types. It is known to be related to the aggressiveness of the disease, increased mortality and higher relapse ratio. The unusual HER2 overexpression is associated with more severe disease characteristics in several cancers. In recent past, there have been remarkable advances in understanding the role of the HER2 gene in cancers. Caspases are well renowned proteases that act as essential initiators and executioners of the apoptotic process. The primary function of HER2 is suppressing apoptosis to enhance cell survival and eventually giving rise to uncontrolled proliferation and tumor growth. The objective of this work was to study the expression levels of HER2 and apoptosis related factors CASP-3 and CASP-8 in several breast and other cancer cell lines and finally to find a meaningful correlation between all these. We summed up by obtaining an increase in expression of HER2 in all cancer cell lines as compared to that of CASP-3 and CASP-8. In summary we conclude that HER2 promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis i.e. by downregulating CASP-3 and CASP-8. This is a novel study comprising the expression study of HER2 and different caspases in different cancer cell lines simultaneously. It is thus expected that this study will aid in better establishment of correlation between HER2 and caspases in different malignancies.",

As a general concept \"targeted drugs\" are effective only when the tumor exhibits the \"target\", which in breast cancer pathology may correspond to the expression of Estrogen Receptors and/or of HER2. These biomarkers are evaluated on breast cancer tissues by companion diagnostic tests, however, evidence suggests that the first step in breast cancer predictive pathology is still represented by morphology. For instance, histological types, such as tubular and cribriform carcinomas, define patients who may not need any treatments other than surgical excision. Neoadjuvant studies have shown that patients affected by lobular carcinomas are not likely to have any beneficial effects from chemotherapy. The second step in prediction is represented by immunophenotyping. If the immunohistochemical evaluation of four markers (estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2 and Ki67) remains the best practice for breast cancer predictive pathology, molecular pathology has certainly reshaped the way we approach breast cancer diagnosis. The aim of this review is to discuss current knowledge in predictive pathology for the management of breast cancer patients, focusing on the benefits and drawbacks of traditional tools and of novel improvements of molecular biology.",

Here we describe a screening method developed to decipher between host antibodies against HER-2 and that of Herceptin. By producing a series of truncation mutants within the epitope of Herceptin, we were able to inhibit this binding. We demonstrated also that by a three amino acid substitution (PPF→SSS) we were able to abrogate Herceptin binding while generating a highly conserved HER-2 extracellular domain (ECD). By producing a stable cell line that expresses this mutated form of the human HER-2 ECD, we have a source of this protein to probe patient sera.

The Ontario Familial Breast Cancer Registry collects clinical and family history data in familial breast carcinoma cases, and unselected Ashkenazi breast carcinomas, and acts as a tumor tissue repository.;Using this resource, we examined the tumor morphology, hormone receptor status, and HER-2/neu protein overexpression in Canadian Ashkenazi breast carcinoma patients whose germline BRCA1 mutation status is known.;Thirty-eight tumors from 32 BRCA1 carriers and 354 tumors from 334 noncarriers were analyzed. The tumors in BRCA1 mutation carriers were more likely to be high grade (P < 0.0001) and estrogen receptor negative (P < 0.004). There was an increased frequency of typical medullary carcinomas in mutation carriers when all tumors were analyzed. However, this difference did not remain statistically significant when only the first tumor diagnosed in each patient was included in the analysis. There was no difference in HER-2/neu protein overexpression between the two groups overall (P = 0.07). However, when the analysis was restricted to Grade III tumors, there were significantly fewer HER-2/neu-positive tumors in the mutation carriers versus noncarriers (3.1% vs. 21.5%, P = 0.012). No significant differences were found in the incidence of lymph node status, progesterone receptor status, lymphatic vessel invasion, degree of lymphocytic infiltration, or in the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ associated with the invasive tumors.;Increasing awareness of the morphologic and immunophenotypic features more commonly found in BRCA1-associated breast carcinomas may lead to a wider use of these characteristics in genetic screening programs and provide further clues to their pathogenesis.",

A 28-bp GGA repeat sequence (Pu28-mer) in the nuclease hypersensitive site of the ERBB2 promoter region may play an important role in the regulation of ERBB2 transcription, possibly involving the formation of a G-quadruplex. In order to investigate this possibility, an affinity MALDI-MS approach was used for in vitro protein capture from nuclear extracts from cultured MCF-7 and BT-474 cancer cells at Pu28-mer and control oligonucleotide-modified surfaces. Captured proteins from MCF-7 cells were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Based on these results, Western blot was then used to interrogate captured proteins from both MCF-7 and the Her-2/neu-positive BT-474 cells. Results support the formation of a G-quadruplex by Pu28-mer, indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, that selectively captures transcription factors including Ku70, Ku80, PURA, nucleolin, and hnRNP K. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed binding of Ku70, Ku80, PURA, and nucleolin to ERBB2 promoter in the live BT-474 cells. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the role of non-duplex DNA structures in gene regulation and provide a more complete picture of the regulation of ErbB2 expression in breast cancer. The results also provide a blueprint for development of \"genome-inspired\" aptamers based on the Pu28-mer sequence for in vitro and in vivo detection of proteins related to regulation of ERBB2 gene expression and breast cancer.",

The associations between the levels of HER2-AAbs and breast cancer risk, and recurrence-free survival, were examined. High levels of HER2-AAbs were significantly associated with a reduced risk of DCIS (odds ratio [OR] 0.19, P = 4.6 × 10(-7)) or IBC (OR 0.31, P = 3.7 × 10(-7)).

However, pathways mediating the activity of integrin αvβ6 in clinical progression of invasive breast cancers need further elucidation. We have examined human breast cancer specimens (N = 460) for the expression of integrin β6 (ITGB6) mRNA by qPCR.

Radiotherapy is often used to treat early premalignant lesions regardless of ErbB2 status. Here, we show that clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation (IR)-induce cellular invasion of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells, as well as MCF10A cells overexpressing ErbB2. ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells, such as MCF7 and T47D, do not invade following treatment with IR nor do MCF10A cells overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor. ErbB2 becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine 877 in a dose- and time- dependent manner following exposure to X-rays, and activates downstream signaling cascades including PI3K/Akt. Inhibition of these pathways, as well as inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with antioxidants, prevents IR-induced invasion. Activation of ErbB2-dependent signaling results in upregulation of the forkhead family transcription factor, FoxM1, and its transcriptional targets, including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Inhibition of FoxM1 by RNA interference prevented induction of invasion by IR, and overexpression of FoxM1 in MCF10A cells was sufficient to promote IR-induced invasion. Moreover, we found that 14-3-3ζ is also upregulated by IR in cancer cells in a ROS-dependent manner, is required for IR-induced invasion in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells and together with FoxM1 is sufficient for invasion in ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells. Thus, our data show that IR-mediated activation of ErbB2 and induction of 14-3-3ζ collaborate to regulate FoxM1 and promote invasion of breast cancer cells and furthermore, may serve as therapeutic targets to enhance radiosensitivity of breast cancers.

A more recently introduced predictive marker is HER-2 for selecting patients with advanced breast cancer for treatment with the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). In adjuvant breast cancer, overproduction of HER-2 may also indicate an enhanced sensitivity to high-dose anthracycline-based regimens. On the other hand, in both early and advanced breast cancer, high concentrations of HER-2 appear to correlate with a lower probability of response to hormone therapy. Although many different anticancer drugs appear to mediate tumor regression by inducing apoptosis, there is currently no consistent evidence that any of the molecules implicated in this process can be used as predictive markers.;Currently, the only recommended predictive markers in oncology are ER and PR for selecting endocrine-sensitive breast cancers and HER-2 for identifying breast cancer patients with metastatic disease who may benefit from trastuzumab.

Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been known to contribute to breast cancer progression. It is unclear whether Ano1 is associated with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients with different ER, PR and HER2 status. In the present study, we investigated the Ano1 expression in 431 patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma and 46 patients with fibroadenoma, using immunohistochemistry, and analyzed the association between Ano1 expression and clinical characteristics and outcomes of breast cancer patients with different ER, PR, and HER2 status. Ano1 was overexpressed in breast cancer compared with fibroadenoma. Ano1 was significantly more associated with breast cancer with the lower clinical stage (stage I or II), or triple-negative status. Mostly importantly, Ano1 overexpression was associated with good prognosis in patients with the PR-positive or HER2-negative status, and in patients following tamoxifen treatment. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that Ano1 overexpression was a prognostic factor for longer overall survival in PR-positive or HER2-negative patients, and a predictive factor for longer overall survival in patients following tamoxifen treatment. Our findings suggest that Ano1 may be a potential marker for good prognosis in PR-positive or HER2-negative patients following tamoxifen treatment.

        "Doc_abstract":"ErbB2 (HER2, Neu), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase family, is often overexpressed in breast cancer and other malignancies. ErbB2 homodimerizes but also presents as a common auxiliary subunit of the EGF and heregulin receptors (erbB1 or EGFR; and erbB3-4, respectively), with which it heteroassociates. ErbB2 is generally regarded as an orphan (ligand-less) receptor with a very potent kinase domain activated either via its associated partners or constitutively as a consequence of discrete mutations. It follows that the extent and regulation of its cell surface interactions are of central importance. We have studied the large-scale association pattern of erbB2 in quiescent and activated cells labeled with fluorescent anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibodies using scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). ErbB2 was found to be concentrated in irregular membrane patches with a mean diameter of approx. 0.5 microm in nonactivated SKBR3 and MDA453 human breast tumor cells. The average number of erbB2 proteins in a single cluster on nonactivated SKBR3 cells was about 10(3). Activation of SKBR3 cells with EGF, heregulin as well as a partially agonistic anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibody led to an increase in the mean cluster diameter to 0.6-0.9 microm, irrespective of the ligand. The EGF-induced increase in the erbB2 cluster size was inhibited by the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035. The average size of erbB2 clusters on the erbB2-transfected line of CHO cells (CB2) was similar to that of activated SKBR3 cells, a finding correlated with the increased base-line tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB2 in cells expressing only erbB2. We conclude that an increase in cluster size may constitute a general phenomenon in the activation of erbB2.",

HER-2/neu and CA 15-3 values were measured in retrospective samples obtained from 59 patients with metastatic breast cancer undergoing treatment over a 6-12 month period. Serial changes in serum HER-2/neu and CA 15-3 were correlated with changes in clinical status on a visit-to-visit basis. For each pair of serial measurements, changes of equal to or greater than, or less than 15% for HER-2/neu and 21% for CA 15-3 were considered to indicate progression or lack of progression, respectively.;The ADVIA Centaur HER-2/neu assay demonstrated within-run imprecision and total imprecision ranging from 3.0-5.6% and from 3.2-5.7%, respectively. The upper limit of normal was 15.2 ng/mL (90% CI: 14.2-17.0 ng/mL). No significant interference (<5%) was seen with bilirubins, hemoglobin, triglycerides and cholesterol or therapeutic drugs commonly present in the sera of breast cancer patients. The minimum detectable concentration (analytical sensitivity) was found to be 0.5 ng/mL. The patient population in the clinical study included breast cancer patients who responded to therapy (stable, partial or complete response) or had disease progression. HER-2/neu levels showed a concordance of 78.1% (82/105 restaging time points) with the clinical course of disease, whereas CA 15-3 levels showed a concordance of 76.2% (80/105 restaging time points).

However, in order to apply it as a complementary therapeutic agent in breast cancer, more information is needed regarding the sensitivity of the different breast tumor subtypes and its effect in combination with the currently used chemotherapy. Here, we analyzed the antitumor activities of a supercritical fluid rosemary extract (SFRE) in different breast cancer cells, and used a genomic approach to explore its effect on the modulation of ER-α and HER2 signaling pathways, the most important mitogen pathways related to breast cancer progression. We found that SFRE exerts antitumor activity against breast cancer cells from different tumor subtypes and the downregulation of ER-α and HER2 receptors by SFRE might be involved in its antitumor effect against estrogen-dependent (ER+) and HER2 overexpressing (HER2+) breast cancer subtypes. Moreover, SFRE significantly enhanced the effect of breast cancer chemotherapy (tamoxifen, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel). Overall, our results support the potential utility of SFRE as a complementary approach in breast cancer therapy. ",

Studies using cDNA microarrays have recently led to the re-classification of invasive breast carcinomas, based on their molecular signature, into three main groups: luminal; HER2 (Human Epidermal Receptor 2) overexpressing, and basal-like. Although the latter group is the least prevalent it is the most aggressive one, lacking a target based therapy, since their main characteristic is being negative for hormonal receptors or HER2. So, it is of paramount importance to try to unravel their histogenic origin and characterize their molecular and immunohistochemical profiles. EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), which is overexpressed in a high proportion of these carcinomas, is a potential therapeutic target, and clinical trials with inhibitors of its activity may represent important advances in basal-like breast carcinomas therapy.",

Some women with HER-2/neu-negative tumors by tissue testing develop increased ECD concentrations in metastatic disease. Increased ECD has been correlated with indicators of poor prognosis, e.g., overall survival and disease-free survival. Increased ECD predicts a poor response to hormone therapy and some chemotherapy regimens but can predict improved response to combinations of Herceptin and chemotherapy. Many studies support the value of monitoring ECD during breast cancer progression because serial increases precede the appearance of metastases and longitudinal ECD changes parallel the clinical course of disease.;The monitoring of circulating HER-2/neu ECD provides a tool for assessing prognosis, for predicting response to therapy, and for earlier detection of disease progression and timely intervention with appropriate therapy.",

In this study, we established a new method, dot blot assay, to measure the serum HER2 level in breast cancer patients and further to evaluate the clinical value for monitoring breast cancer progression. We found that the serum HER2 level measured by dot blot assay was significantly correlated with tissue HER2 status in breast cancer patients (P = 0.001), and also significantly correlated with HER2 level measured by ELISA (P = 1.06×10(-11)). Compared with ELISA method, the specificity and sensitivity of dot blot assay were 95.3% and 65.0%, respectively. The serum HER2 levels of patients with grade III or ER-negative were higher than those with grade I-II (P = 0.004) and ER-positive (P = 0.033), respectively.

It has been suggested that anti-oestrogen therapy may induce a HER2 signalling pathway in breast cancer cells and this may cause resistance to anti-oestrogen. Thus, it is conceivable that combined therapy with anti-oestrogen and anti-HER2 antibody might be more effective. In the present study, we investigated the effect of combined treatment with a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, rhumAbHER2 (trastuzumab), and an anti-oestrogen, ICI 182,780, on the cell growth of three human breast cancer cell lines which respectively express different levels of ER and HER2. The combined treatment enhanced the growth inhibitory effect on ML-20 cells, which express a high level of ER and a moderate level of HER2, but showed no additive effect on either KPL-4 cells, which express no ER and a moderate level of HER2, or MDA-MB-231 cells, which express no ER and a low level of HER2. It is also suggested that both the antibody and anti-oestrogen induce a G1-S blockade and apoptosis.

In vitro studies thus far demonstrated that Taspase1 plays important roles in the proliferation of various cancer cell lines, including HER2-positive breast cancer cells. To investigate the role of Taspase1 in breast tumorigenesis in vivo, we deleted Taspase1 from mouse mammary glands by generating MMTV-neu;MMTV-cre;Tasp1(F/-) mice. We demonstrate that initiation of MMTV-neu- but not MMTV-wnt-driven breast cancer is blocked in the absence of Taspase1. Importantly, Taspase1 loss alone neither impacts normal development nor pregnancy physiology of the mammary gland. In mammary glands Taspase1 deficiency abrogates MMTV-neu-induced cyclins E and A expression, thereby preventing tumorigenesis. The mechanisms were explored in HER2-positive breast cancer cell line BT474 and HER2-transformed MCF10A cells and validated using knockdown-resistant Taspase1. As Taspase1 was shown to cleave MLL which forms complexes with E2F transcription factors to regulate Cyclins E, A, and B expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we investigated whether the cleavage of MLL by Taspase1 constitutes an essential in vivo axis for HER2/neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis. To this end, we generated MMTV-neu;MLL(nc/nc) transgenic mice that carry homozygous non-cleavable MLL alleles. Remarkably, these mice are also protected from HER2/neu-driven breast tumorigenesis. Hence, MLL is the primary Taspase1 substrate whose cleavage is required for MMTV-neu-induced tumor formation. As Taspase1 plays critical roles in breast cancer pathology, it may serve as a therapeutic target for HER2-positive human breast cancer. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Amplification of the HER2 oncogene in breast cancer identifies patients who are likely to respond to anti-HER2 mAb therapy. Current clinical practice dictates that all breast cancers first undergo HER2 screening by IHC. Strongly positive (3+ on a 0-to-3+ scale) IHC cases are considered as HER2-amplified tumors and are not evaluated further because of the strong correlation between HER2 gene amplification as measured by FISH and 3+ IHC. This strong correlation has recently been questioned, and some data suggest that over 50% of 3+ IHC HER2 immunostains may not be due to HER2 gene amplification. To help resolve this discrepancy, the authors developed a quantitative PCR assay for HER2. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the amount of HER2 DNA relative to a control gene, IF2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor, 2p11.1-q11.1). The PCR assay is performed on genomic DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue. The PCR assay developed is a monoplex assay in which the HER2 and IF2 PCRs are performed in separate cuvettes. Cases of HER2 FISH amplified breast cancer and HER2 FISH nonamplified breast cancer were chosen for study by monoplex HER2 PCR. HER2 overexpression was evaluated by IHC. Twenty-two cases of HER2-positive and 22 cases of HER2-negative breast cancer, as determined by FISH, were assayed for HER2 by PCR and IHC. Sixteen of the 44 cases were interpreted as 3+ IHC. All 16 showed HER2 amplification by PCR and 15 showed HER2 amplification by FISH. One FISH negative case was found to be HER2 amplified by PCR and showed 3+ IHC stain, suggesting the FISH result in this case was underinterpreted. Two FISH positive cases were found to be negative by PCR and negative in IHC as well, suggesting the FISH result in these cases was overinterpreted. The authors conclude that 3+ IHC membrane staining correctly identifies neoplasms showing HER2 gene amplification. Monoplex HER2 PCR may offer significant advantages over both IHC and FISH for HER2 testing in breast cancer.",

Risk groups based on the St. Gallen classification were categorized as average or minimal risk. The prognostic values of HER-2 in combination with the St. Gallen classification were analyzed with respect to disease-free survival (DFS) rates.;A total of 906 patients were eligible for analysis. The overall 7-year DFS rate was 87.5%. The 7-year DFS rates for patients with HER-2-positive and HER-2-negative tumors were, respectively, 77.9% and 91.2% (P = 0.002). The 7-year DFS rates for patients with average and minimal risk group were 85.0% and 97.9%, respectively. The authors found that HER-2 overexpression significantly predicted the risk of disease recurrence (odds ratio = 3.03 [95% confidence interval, 1.63-5.63]). Furthermore, when HER-2 status was combined with the St. Gallen classification, the DFS rate of the HER-2-positive average risk group was 73.3% compared with 88.4% for the HER-2-negative average risk group (P = 0.007).;The combination of HER-2 overexpression and the St. Gallen classification was more useful than either alone to predict the risk of disease recurrence in patients with lymph node-negative breast carcinoma.",

A subset of breast cancer patients with high HER-2/neu levels eventually experience metastatic disease progression when treated with Herceptin as a single agent. Mechanistic details of development of this aggressive disease are not clear. Therefore, there is a dire need to better understand the mechanisms by which drug resistance develops and to design new combined treatments that benefit patients with aggressive breast cancer and have minimal toxicity. We hypothesized that 3, 3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), a non-toxic agent can be combined with Herceptin to treat breast cancers with high levels of HER-2/neu. Here, we evaluated the effects of Herceptin alone and in combination with DIM on cell viability, apoptosis and clonogenic assays in SKBR3 (HER-2/neu-expressing) and MDA-MB-468 (HER-2/neu negative) breast cancer cells. We found that DIM could enhance the effectiveness of Herceptin by significantly reducing cell viability, which was associated with apoptosis-induction and significant inhibition of colony formation, compared with single agent treatment. These results were consistent with the down-regulation of Akt and NF-kB p65. Mechanistic investigations revealed a significant upregulation of miR-200 and reduction of FoxM1 expression in DIM and Herceptin-treated breast cancer cells. We, therefore, transfected cells with pre-miR-200 or silenced FoxM1 in these cells for understanding the molecular mechanism involved. These results provide experimental evidence, for the first time, that DIM plus Herceptin therapy could be translated to the clinic as a therapeutic modality to improve treatment outcome of patients with breast cancer, particularly for the patients whose tumors express high levels of HER-2/neu.",

Although the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin(R)) has become a valuable therapeutic option for patients with Her-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer, many patients do not benefit from this therapy. To evaluate the effect of receptor activation on tumor response, we have investigated the phosphorylation status of Her-2/neu and EGFR in 46 Her-2/neu-overexpressing tumor samples from trastuzumab-treated metastatic breast cancer patients by immunohistochemistry. Activated (p)tyr-1248 Her-2/neu was detected in 9 of 46 breast cancers (20%), and activated (p)tyr-845 and (p)tyr-1173 EGFR were both present in 6 tumors (13%) while EGFR was present in 16 cases (35%). ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu showed a trend to correlate with increased response to trastuzumab (p = 0.063), while ptyr-845, ptyr-1173 EGFR and EGFR did not. The presence of ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu and ptyr-845 or ptyr-1173 EGFR, however, was a strong predictor of both response to trastuzumab-based treatment (OR = 8.0, p = 0.021 and OR = 8.0, p = 0.021) and clinical benefit (OR = 5.47, p = 0.041 and OR = 6.22, p = 0.028 multivariate logistic regression analysis). Furthermore, ptyr-845 EGFR and ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu were both independent predictors of progression-free survival (RR = 0.21, p = 0.01 and RR = 0.45, p = 0.026, multivariate analysis). Patients with ptyr-845 EGFR positive tumors also tended toward increased overall survival (RR = 0.17, p = 0.082). Taken together, we have demonstrated that the determination of activated EGFR improves the utility of ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu staining in predicting the clinical outcome of patients undergoing trastuzumab treatment.

It is also unclear whether HER-2 status can change during disease progression or after chemotherapy.;Breast carcinoma samples from 60 women with known HER-2 status in both primary tumors and paired metastases (locoregional disease, n = 43 patients; distant disease, n = 17 patients) were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-two patients underwent chemotherapy before their metastatic lesions were sampled, including 18 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 14 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. The HER-2 gene was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization either in paraffin-embedded tissue samples (48 primary tumors and 9 metastatic tumors) or in fine-needle aspirates (12 primary tumors and 51 metastatic tumors). HER-2 gene amplification was defined as a HER-2:chromosome 17 signal ratio >/= 2.0.;The HER-2 status of primary and metastatic tumors agreed in 58 of 60 patients (97%), including 18 (30%) amplified tumors and 40 (67%) nonamplified tumors. A discrepancy in HER-2 status was observed in specimens from two patients in which HER-2 amplification was detected in the primary tumor but not the metastatic tumors. In one patient, three foci of tumor nodules were found in the same breast; the HER-2 status was assessed in only one of them, which showed amplification; however, HER-2 amplification was not detected in the axillary lymph node metastasis. In another patient, the HER-2 gene was amplified in the primary tumor but not in the liver metastasis. No metastases showed HER-2 amplification without amplification in the primary tumor. Locoregional and distant metastases demonstrated similar concordance rates with their corresponding primary tumors (98% and 94%, respectively). Complete concordance of HER-2 status was found between primary tumors prior to chemotherapy and metastases that were sampled after chemotherapy.;The HER-2 status in breast carcinoma generally was stable during metastasis, whether to locoregional or distant sites. Chemotherapy did not modify the HER-2 status in metastatic lesions. Therefore, HER-2 amplification can be evaluated reliably in material from either primary or metastatic tumors in most patients.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether HER2 is stable during the process of recurrence.

A concordance of HER2 overexpression between the primary lesions and matching regional recurrences was observed in 85.71% of the breast cancer cases. Five out of the 35 paired samples (14.28%) were discordant. Only 3 patients who had 2+ HER2 expression in the primary tumors showed HER2 down-regulation (0 or 1+) in the recurrences, while the HER2 score in 2 patients changed oppositely. Moreover, all of the cases with 3+ HER2 staining in the primary lesions retained HER2 overexpression in the recurrences. The HER2 is commonly expressed in breast cancer, and its expression in the primary tumors and the corresponding recurrences was concordant in the majority of the cases.

Dysregulation of several microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a key role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. In this study, we screened and identified miRNAs dysregualted in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Our molecular study demonstrated that miR-489 was specifically downregulated by the HER2-downstream signaling, especially through the MAPK pathway. Restoration or overexpression of miR-489 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells significantly inhibited cell growth in vitro and decreased the tumorigenecity and tumor growth in xenograft mice. Mechanistically, we found that overexpression of miR-489 led to the decreased levels of HER2 and SHP2 and thus attenuated HER2-downstream signaling. Furthermore, we for the first time demonstrated that HER2 is a direct target of miR-489 and therefore HER2-SHP2-MAPK and miR-489 signaling pathways form a mutually inhibitory loop. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis and Fluorescent in situ hybridization technique (FISH), we found that miR-489 was expressed at significantly lower level in tumor tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues. Downregulation of miR-489 in breast cancers was associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes. Overall, our results define a double-negative feedback loop involving miR-489 and the HER2-SHP2-MAPK signaling axis that can regulate breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression and might have therapeutic relevance for HER2-positive breast cancer.

In contrast to some well-documented genomic amplifications, molecular mechanisms leading to ERBB2 transcriptional overexpression remain poorly characterized. Gene expression analyses of breast cancer have characterized distinct transcriptional signatures allowing a molecular classification of breast carcinoma. Coexpression of the ERBB2 and GATA4 genes was originally observed in tumors. Both genes are essential for cardiovascular development and GATA4 has been proposed to control the transcription of critical genes for the differentiation and the function of myocardium. We determined that ERBB2-targeted small interfering RNA repressed both ERBB2 and GATA4 genes, whereas GATA4-targeted small interfering RNA repressed GATA4 and activated ERBB2 transcription. Transfected GATA4-expressing construct repressed ERBB2 promoter. Phylogenetic foot printing revealed multiple putative GATA4 binding sites conserved in mammals within the ERBB2 promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that GATA4 binds specifically to several ERBB2 gene noncoding regions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed GATA4 binding to a well-conserved consensus motif. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of this new regulatory element for the activity of the ERBB2 gene enhancer. In agreement with a repressor role of GATA4 on ERBB2 gene expression balanced by ERBB2 activation of the GATA4 gene, a negative correlation between the relative levels of ERBB2 and GATA4 mRNA was observed in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor samples. We propose that the negative feedback loop linking ERBB2 and GATA4 plays a role in the transcriptional dysregulation of ERBB2 gene expression in breast cancer.",

Here, we aimed to establish a risk score to allow for prediction of the presence of HER-2 gene status.;A total of 182 HER-2 2+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) invasive breast cancer cases were enrolled in this study. The association between clinicopathological variables like age, sex, tumor grade, hormone receptor (HR) status, P53 and proliferation index (Ki67), and FISH result using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria was evaluated. Also, we compared the HER-2 FISH results using FDA criteria and 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guideline.;The study population had a median age of 48 years (range, 29-78 years). Estrogen receptor (ER) was expressed in 131 (72.0%) patients. 73.1% of patients (133/182) were progesterone receptor (PR) positive. The median Ki67 value was 20% (range, 3-90%). There was good agreement between the FDA and 2013 ASCO/CAP guideline. Sixty-three of all patients were HER-2 FISH amplified (positive) based on FDA criteria. Tumors with HER-2 amplified were more likely to harbor ER negative (58.8% vs. 25.2%, P<0.001) or PR negative (57.1% vs. 26.3%, P<0.001) or P53 negative (44.8% vs. 29.8%, P=0.048). A significant high level of Ki67 was detected in HER-2 amplified groups (P=0.006). We created a risk score that comprised HR, P53 and Ki67.

Although HR positivity predicts efficacy of endocrine agents, preclinical and clinical data suggest that HER2 overexpression confers intrinsic resistance to hormonal treatment. In addition, HER2 overexpression is an independent adverse prognostic factor regardless of the hormonal status of the tumor, indicating that patients with HR+/HER2+ breast tumors might not derive a benefit from single-agent hormonal therapy. These data provided a strong rationale for exploring the targeting of both HR and HER2 signaling pathways in HR+/HER2+ breast tumors to optimize hormonal therapy and overcome resistance to anti-estrogen therapy. Results from a randomized clinical trial that combined hormonal treatment with targeted anti-HER2 therapy in postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2+ advanced breast cancer indicate that this novel dual-targeting strategy significantly improves outcomes compared with endocrine treatment alone. Nonetheless, other data suggest that it might achieve an inferior outcome compared with anti-HER2 therapy plus chemotherapy. Therefore, targeting both the HR and HER2 signaling pathways upfront might not be the most-effective therapeutic strategy in the management of HR+/HER2+ breast cancer.

A polymorphism in the HER2 gene (I655V) has been associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer in some ethnic groups. METHODS Subjects from a community-based study of 5318 Ashkenazim from the Washington, DC area were selected for analysis of the I655V HER2 germline polymorphism. We estimated age-specific breast cancer risk from HER2 I655V based on the family history data, using the female first-degree relatives of the study participants and a novel extension of the kin cohort method. RESULTS The estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer to age 70 was approximately 30% higher among HER2 I655V carriers than noncarriers (RR = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.83). The effect of the allele seems stronger at younger ages (among women younger than 50 years, RR = 2.11; CI = 1.39-3.28) and especially among younger women with a family history of breast cancer (RR = 8.9; CI = 1.9-19.7). Increased risk of breast cancer associated with the I655V allele was also observed among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, although these results are based on small numbers. CONCLUSION These analyses suggest that the HER2 valine allele might be associated with increased risk of breast cancer, especially in young women and in women with a family history of the disease.",

Using the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, cell cytotoxicity and proliferation were evaluated by MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay was established by transient transfecting MCF-7 cells with plasmids containing either the ERBB2 or the ESR1 promoter region linked to the luciferase gene. Chinese herbal extracts were used to treat the cells at 24 h after transfection, followed by measurement of their luciferase activity. The screening results were verified by Western blotting to measure HER2 and ER α protein expression. Results. At concentrations that induced little cytotoxicity, thirteen single herbal extracts and five compound recipes were found to increase either ERBB2 or ESR1 luciferase activity. By Western blotting, Si-Wu-Tang, Kuan-Shin-Yin, and Suan-Tsao-Ren-Tang were found to increase either HER2 or ER α protein expression. In addition, Ligusticum chuanxiong was shown to have a great effect on ERBB2 gene expression and synergistically with estrogen to stimulate MCF-7 cell growth. Conclusion.

        "Doc_abstract":"Aromatase (product of CYP19 gene), the critical enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis, is up-regulated in 70% of all breast cancers and is highly correlated with cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), the rate-determining enzyme in prostanoid biosynthesis. Expression of COX-2 also is correlated with the oncogene HER-2/neu. The efficacy of current endocrine therapies for breast cancer is predicted only if the tumor contains significant amounts of estrogen receptor. Because the progesterone receptor (PR) is an estrogen-induced target gene, it has been suggested that its presence may serve as an indicator of estrogen receptor functional capacity and the differentiation state of the tumor. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that PR serves a crucial protective role by antagonizing inflammatory response pathways in the breast. We observed that progesterone antagonized the stimulatory effects of cAMP and IL-1beta on aromatase, COX-2, and HER-2/neu expression in T47D breast cancer cells. These actions of progesterone were associated with increased expression of the nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor, IkappaBalpha. In 28 breast cancer cell lines, IkappaBalpha expression was positively correlated with PR mRNA levels; overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant of IkappaBalpha inhibited expression of aromatase, COX-2, and HER-2/neu. Moreover, in breast cancer cell lines cultured in the absence of progesterone, up-regulation of endogenous PR caused decreased expression of aromatase, COX-2, and HER-2/neu expression, whereas down-regulation of endogenous PR resulted in a marked induction of aromatase and HER-2/neu mRNA. Collectively, these findings suggest that PR plays an important antiinflammatory role in breast cancer cells via ligand-dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms.",

A 44 kDa glycoprotein that elevates tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu has been isolated and named Neu differentiation factor (NDF), or heregulin. Here we show that NDF affects tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu in human tumor cells of breast, colon and neuronal origin, but not in ovarian cells that overexpress the receptor. By using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to Neu, we found that the ovarian receptor is immunologically and biochemically similar to the mammary p185neu. Nevertheless, unlike breast-derived Neu, the ovarian protein did not display covalent cross-linking to radiolabeled NDF, and was devoid of ligand-induced association with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. Direct binding analysis showed that NDF binds with high affinity (Kd approximately 10(-9) M) to mammary cells, but its weak association with ovarian cells is probably mediated by heparin-like molecules. Similar to the endogenous receptor, the ectopically overexpressed Neu of mammary cells, but not of ovarian and fibroblastic cells, exhibited elevated levels of NDF-induced phosphorylation and covalent cross-linking of the radiolabeled factor. Taken together, our results imply that NDF binding to cells requires both Neu and an additional cellular component, whose identity is still unknown, but its tissue distribution is more restricted than the expression of the neu gene.",

ER expression showed a significant correlation with patient menopausal status (p<0.05). The prevalence of PCNA positivity in the tumor cell components is slightly higher in postmenopausal compared to premenopausal women (p>0.20). The current study is consistent with reports from other groups regarding the correlation of HER-2/neu with adverse pathologic features and with expression of other markers in carcinoma. We also observed there was no trend toward increased HER-2/neu expression in either premenopausal or postmenopausal patients, i.e. there was similar HER-2/neu expression in the two groups. This suggests that HER-2/neu status could be used to determine assignment to specific intensive adjuvant therapy and evaluation of biological behavior in both pre- and postmenopausal patients with breast carcinoma.",

However, the association between circadian clock genes and prognosis in breast cancer has not been systematically studied. Therefore, we examined the expression of 17 clock components in tumors from 766 node-negative breast cancer patients that were untreated in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. In addition, their association with metastasis-free survival (MFS) and correlation to clinicopathological parameters were investigated. Aiming to estimate functionality of the clockwork, we studied clock gene expression relationships by correlation analysis. Higher expression of several clock genes (e.g., CLOCK, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY2, NPAS2 and RORC) was found to be associated with longer MFS in univariate Cox regression analyses (HR<1 and FDR-adjusted P < 0.05). Stratification according to molecular subtype revealed prognostic relevance for PER1, PER3, CRY2 and NFIL3 in the ER+/HER2- subgroup, CLOCK and NPAS2 in the ER-/HER2- subtype, and ARNTL2 in HER2+ breast cancer. In the multivariate Cox model, only PER3 (HR = 0.66; P = 0.016) and RORC (HR = 0.42; P = 0.003) were found to be associated with survival outcome independent of established clinicopathological parameters. Pairwise correlations between functionally-related clock genes (e.g., PER2-PER3 and CRY2-PER3) were stronger in ER+, HER2- and low-grade carcinomas; whereas, weaker correlation coefficients were observed in ER- and HER2+ tumors, high-grade tumors and tumors that progressed to metastatic disease. In conclusion, loss of clock genes is associated with worse prognosis in breast cancer. Coordinated co-expression of clock genes, indicative of a functional circadian clock, is maintained in ER+, HER2-, low grade and non-metastasizing tumors but is compromised in more aggressive carcinomas.

This receptor possesses intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and has been associated with aggressive biological behavior and poor clinical outcome. METHODS: Data have been reviewed regarding the role of HER-2 expression as a prognostic variable, as a predictive factor for response to chemotherapy and hormonal therapies, and as a directed therapeutic target for breast cancer. RESULTS: Therapy with a humanized monoclonal antibody to HER-2 (trastuzumab) can be effective treatment in some patients with metastatic breast cancer, either given alone or in combination with some chemotherapeutic agents. Cardiac toxicity limits concurrent use with anthracyclines. Clinical trials will further define optimal combination regimens with this agent, and its value in patients with localized or locally advanced stages. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab is a significant addition to the armamentarium against breast cancer. Standardization of the optimal method to evaluate for HER-2 overexpression is necessary to better define its role as a prognostic, predictor, and therapeutic target in this disease.",

In breast cancer cell lines it has been proven that SATB1 could upregulate the expression of the HER2. In this paper, the relevance of SATB1 and HER2 expression was assessed in human breast cancer tissues, and their influence on tumor histological grade and patients' survival was explored.;Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), 169 patients with breast cancer were assessed for SATB1 expression, HER2 amplification and hormone-receptor (HR) expression. The effects of SATB1 expression on HER2 and HR expression as well as their association with clinicopathologic characteristics were further analyzed by statistical evaluation.;SATB1 expression was correlated with HER2 expression in breast cancer(r = 0.191; p = 0.013). SATB1, HER2 and SATB1/HER2 co-expression was negatively correlated with HR expression (r = -0.228, p = 0.003; r = -0.338, p = 0.000; r = -0.527, p = 0.000, respectively).

Multivariate cox regression analyses showed that SATB1 and HER2 were independent risk factors for breast cancer patients, while HR was a protective factor for patients' survival.

Also, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) belongs to the one of four members of tyrosin kinase type 1 family in which overexpression of HER2 is associated with malignancy in breast cancer. This study was aimed to bioinformatics analysis and designing a recombinant chimeric protein containing MUC1 and HER2 antigens to express in prokaryotic host (Escherichia coli) as breast cancer diagnosis tools. The immunogenic sequences of MUC1 and HER2 were extracted and fused together by a linker. The chimeric construct was analyzed by bioinformatics softwares. The optimization and purification, evaluation of the expression of chimeric protein was performed using Western blotting, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the chimeric construct was stable and immunogenic domains were exposed. The pET-28a vector containing chimeric gene had high level of protein expression. The recombinant chimeric protein was confirmed using Western blotting, and it was investigated using ELISA and IHC. Then, the MUC1 and HER2 combined peptides can be used as coating antigens in ELISA for detection of antibodies against MUC1 or HER2 in human serum. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women after skin cancer. Between 15 to 25% of breast cancers are characterized by overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). HER-2 overexpression has been associated with more aggressive tumor phenotype, poor prognosis and shortened survival. Humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab was the first targeted therapy against HER-2 used in clinical practice. Trastuzumab has significantly improved the prognosis of HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer, is effective as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy, has proven efficacy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and also in adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. Despite trastuzumab success in treatment, several important questions are still not clearly answered. The most discussed issues are the optimal selection of patients with regard to HER-2 testing, combination of trastuzumab with anthracyclines, comparison of the efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with different chemotherapy regimens, the ideal scheduling of trastuzumab administration, the duration of treatment, especially in adjuvant therapy, continuation of trastuzumab treatment beyond disease progression and after development of brain metastasis. Trastuzumab is generally well tolerated and the clinically most important adverse effect is potential for congestive heart failure, therefore careful cardiac monitoring is required for all patients receiving this therapy. Aim of this article is to summarize the results of clinical trials with trastuzumab and refer to some issues concerning trastuzumab administration and toxicity.",

Trastuzumab was conjugated to bifunctional chelator, DOTA, and characterized for integrity and the number of molecules conjugated. Radiolabeling of DOTA-conjugated trastuzumab was optimized using Lu-177. Quality control parameters including radiochemical purity, stability, sterility, pyrogenicity and immunoreactivity were assessed. A preliminary pilot study was conducted on breast cancer patients (n = 6 HER2 positive and n = 4 HER2 negative) to evaluate the ability of Lu-177-trastuzumab for HER2 specific tumor targeting. The conjugates were efficiently labeled with Lu-177 with high radiochemical purity (up to 91%) and specific activity (6-13 µCi/µg). Lu-177-trastuzumab was stable up to 12 hr post labeling. The radioimmunoassay demonstrated good antigen binding ability and specificity for HER2 receptor protein. The patient studies showed the localization of Lu-177-trastuzumab at primary as well as metastatic sites (HER2 positive) in the planar and SPECT/CT images. No tracer uptake was observed in HER2 negative patients that indicated the specificity of Lu-177-trastuzumab.

The criterion for \"high amplification\" was an amplification ratio of >4.0, that for \"moderate amplification\" a ratio between 2.1 and 4.0, and that for \"low amplification\" a ratio of 1.5-2.0.;Using a cutoff point of > or =1.5, the overall frequency of HER-2/neu gene amplification among stage I tumors was 30% (3 out of 10). Of these, one-third (1 out of 3) showed low amplification, one-third (1 out of 3) were moderately amplified, and one-third (1 out of 3) were highly amplified. The overall frequency of HER-2/neu gene amplification among stage II tumors was 0% (0 out of 10). The overall frequency of HER-2/neu gene amplification among stage III tumors was 10% (1 out of 10). The sole tumor found positive was classified as moderately amplified by our criteria. The overall frequency of HER-2/neu gene amplification among stage IV tumors was 50% (5 out of 10). Four of the 5 tumors found positive were highly amplified. The overall frequency of gene amplification in the 40 cases studied was 22.5% (9 out of 40 tumors studied).;Although a linear correlation between HER-2/neu amplification and clinical stage cannot be established at this time, it is interesting to note that when stages I and II, and when stages III and IV are combined, respectively, the latter category has a higher amplification frequency than the former. Furthermore, stage IV has the highest frequency (5 out of 10) of HER-2/neu gene amplification than all three lower stages combined (4 out of 30). This is no doubt due to the high frequency of gene amplification observed in stage IV tumors, which, interestingly, also demonstrate high level amplification of HER-2/neu gene copy numbers. Although the biologic and clinical basis for gene amplification is not clear, given the observation that the most aggressive disease stage is associated with the highest frequency of gene amplification and the most high level amplification, further exploration of HER-2/neu as a prognostic marker of poor outcome using FISH is warranted.",

HER2 has also been studied as a prognostic factor but resulting data has been contradictory. Moreover, clinical trials of HER2-directed therapies, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and lapatinib in ovarian and uterine cancers have been largely disappointing. Current research on HER2 in gynecologic malignancies has focused on identifying mechanisms of resistance and looking further into how HER2 signaling in gynecologic cancers differs from breast cancer.

Our aim was to determine the gene expression profile of ADAM12 in breast cancers in comparison with normal breast and to correlate their level of expression with the clinical and pathological characteristics of breast cancers. Gene expression of ADAM12 spliced variants (12L and 12S) was evaluated using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR in samples obtained by laser capture microdissection from 38 patients with breast cancers and compared with adjacent healthy breast tissues. Both ADAM12L and 12S expression were significantly up-regulated in breast cancers, while in the normal breast, we found a very low expression. ADAM12L expression was significantly correlated with the histopathological types and, although not statistically significant, ADAM12 both variants were up-regulated in high-grade, highly-proliferative and HER2÷neu positive tumors.

HER2 receptor family members function through dimerisation, which can lead to impact on cell function, growth and differentiation; however, their value in breast cancer development remains to be defined. This study aims to examine the relationships of HER2 heterodimers to breast cancer characteristics in trastuzumab naïve and treated cases. HER2 protein (IHC), HER2 gene (chromogenic ISH) and HER2 heterodimerisation status [chromogenic in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)] were assessed in two breast cancer series prepared in tissue microarray (TMA) format. A range of signals/cell for each HER2 heterodimer was detected (0-34.6 signals/cell). The vast majority of cases with HER2 heterodimers showed HER2 gene amplification and/or protein expression. There was an association between HER2 dimerisation with HER3 and HER4 and their protein expression level but no such association was found in with HER1 (EGFR). Of the HER2+ cases, 74, 66, and 58 % showed heterodimers with EGFR, HER3 and HER4, respectively. 51 % of HER2+ tumours expressed all three heterodimers whereas 23 % of the cases did not show expression of any of the three heterodimers. There was an inverse association between the presence and levels of HER2 heterodimers and hormone receptor expression in HER2+ tumours. Tumours exhibiting high levels of HER2 heterodimers demonstrated aggressive clinicopathological features and poor outcome. In the HER2+ cases, dimerisation with EGFR and HER3 but not with HER4 showed an association with aggressive features. There was no association between HER2 heterodimers with patient breast cancer-specific survival or recurrence in HER2+ breast cancer in those patients receiving trastuzumab or not. Our results demonstrate that HER2 dimerisation is a complex process that may underlie the biological heterogeneity of HER2 positive tumours and may identify patients suitable for a specific targeted therapy but does not predict patient outcome for those receiving trastuzumab.

A total of 510 women diagnosed with operable invasive breast cancer between 1997 and 2010 participated in the study. Data on demographics, breast cancer risk factors, and clinico-pathological characteristics were collected. The different breast cancer tumor subtypes were compared on their clinico-pathological characteristics and risk factor profiles, particularly reproductive variables and breastfeeding. Among the 501 breast cancer patients (with known ER and PR receptors), 85% were ER+/PR+ and 15% were ER-&PR-. Among the 405 breast cancer with known ER, PR and HER2 status, 71% were ER+/PR+/HER2- (luminal A), 14% were ER+/PR+/HER2+ (luminal B), 10% were ER-/PR-/HER2- (triple negative breast cancer, TNBC), and 5% were ER-/PR-/HER2+ (non-luminal). A lifetime breastfeeding period equal to or longer than 7 months was less frequent in case patients with TNBC (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.08-0.68) compared to luminal A breast cancers. Both a low (2 or fewer pregnancies) and a high (3-4 pregnancies) number of pregnancies combined with a long breastfeeding period were associated with reduced odds of TNBC compared with luminal A breast cancer, although the association seemed to be slightly more pronounced among women with a low number of pregnancies (OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.005-0.54).;In case-case analyses with the luminal A cases as the reference group, we observed a lower proportion of TNBC among women who breastfed 7 or more months. The combination of longer breastfeeding duration and lower parity seemed to further reduce the odds of having a TNBC compared to a luminal A breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A novel radiation targeted therapy is investigated for HER-2 positive breast cancers. The proposed concept combines two known approaches, but never used together for the treatment of advanced, relapsed or metastasized HER-2 positive breast cancers. The proposed radiation binary targeted concept is based on the anti HER-2 monoclonal antibodies (MABs) that would be used as vehicles to transport the nontoxic agent to cancer cells. The anti HER-2 MABs have been successful in targeting HER-2 positive breast cancers with high affinity. The proposed concept would utilize a neutral nontoxic boron-10 predicting that anti HER-2 MABs would assure its selective delivery to cancer cells. MABs against HER-2 have been a widely researched strategy in the clinical setting. The most promising antibody is Trastuzumab (Herceptin). Targeting HER-2 with the MAB Trastuzumab has been proven to be a successful strategy in inducing tumour regression and improving patient survival. Unfortunately, these tumours become resistant and afflicted women succumb to breast cancer. In the proposed concept, when the tumour region is loaded with boron-10 it is irradiated with neutrons (treatment used for head and neck cancers, melanoma and glioblastoma for over 40 years in Japan and Europe). The irradiation process takes less than an hour producing minimal side effects. This paper summarizes our recent theoretical assessments of radiation binary targeted therapy for HER-2 positive breast cancers on: the effective drug delivery mechanism, the numerical model to evaluate the targeted radiation delivery and the survey study to find the neutron facility in the world that might be capable of producing the radiation effect as needed. A novel method of drug delivery utilizing Trastuzumab is described, followed by the description of a computational Monte Carlo based breast model used to determine radiation dose distributions. The total flux and neutron energy spectra of five currently available neutron irradiation treatment facilities are examined for this application. The tumour boron concentrations and tumour to healthy tissue concentration ratios required to deliver 50 Gy-Eq to the tumour without exceeding 18 Gy-Eq in the skin are determined, as well as the associated therapeutic ratios. Discussion is provided to address the future research direction for assessing the feasibility of the proposed concept.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Fatty acid synthase (FAS), the key metabolic multi-enzyme that is responsible for the terminal catalytic step in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, plays an active role in the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the malignant phenotype in a subset of breast carcinomas. We recently described that a molecular bi-directional cross-talk between FAS and the Her-2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene is taking place at the level of transcription, translation, and activity in breast cancer cells. Because Her-2/neu has been linked with altered sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, we envisioned that FAS gene expression may represent a novel predictive molecular factor for breast cancer response to chemotherapy in a Her-2/neu-related manner. We herein evaluated whether chemotherapy-induced cell damage acts in an epigenetic fashion by inducing changes in the transcriptional activation of FAS gene in breast cancer cells. To evaluate this option, FAS- and Her-2/neu-overexpressing SK-Br3 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a FAS promoter-reporter construct (FAS-Luciferase) harboring all the elements necessary for high level expression in cancer cells. SK-Br3 cells cultured in the presence of topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors doxorubicin and etopoxide (VP-16) demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in FAS promoter activity when compared with control cells growing in drug-free culture conditions. We failed to observe any significant activation of FAS promoter following exposure to the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil, the alkylating drug cisplatin, or the microtubule interfering-agents paclitaxel and vincristine. Moreover, the up-regulatory effects of TOP2A inhibitors on the transcriptional activation of FAS gene expression were not significantly decreased when the FAS promoter was damaged at the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-binding site. Considering that FAS inhibition produces profound inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in cancer cells, we finally asked whether a cross-talk between TOP2A and FAS could exhibit a Her-2/neu-related bi-directional nature. TOP2A protein levels were decreased during treatment with the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab while, concomitantly, FAS promoter activity and FAS protein expression were significantly reduced. Of note, when the expression levels of TOP2A protein were analyzed following exposure of SK-Br3 cells to increasing concentrations of the novel slow-binding FAS inhibitor C75, a dose-dependent reduction in TOP2A expression was observed. Although FAS gene is not physically located in the Her-2/neu-TOP2A amplicon, our present findings strongly suggest that a tight functional association between FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes is taking place in a subset of breast carcinoma cells.",

However, the mechanism of cell death remained unclear. We used several assays to analyze the induction of apoptosis in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 via PMN-dependent Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In the presence of the HER-2/neu Ab 520C9 and PMN from healthy donors, apoptosis occurred as detected by annexin V binding and disappearance of euploid SK-BR-3 nuclei, which can be differentiated from PMN nuclei by their increased DNA contents. Apoptosis induction was observed with E:T cell ratios as low as 10:1. Laser scanning fluorescence microscopy of TUNEL tumor cells or staining for cleaved cytokeratin-18 further confirmed apoptosis of the SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. Killing via 520C9 was dependent on the interaction with FcR on PMN, because 1) F(ab')(2) fragments of 520C9 mediated no cytotoxicity, 2) target cell death was influenced by a biallelic polymorphism of FcgammaRIIa on the effector cells, and 3) a bispecific Ab against HER-2/neu and the IgA receptor (FcalphaRI) expressed on effector cells significantly induced apoptosis. Thus, PMN induce Ab-dependent apoptosis against human breast cancer cells targeted with HER-2/neu-directed mAbs or FcR directed bispecific Abs.",

Increased MIB-1 count, p53 expression, HER-2/neu oncogene amplification and p53 mutations were detected in 33%, 29%, 10% and 8% of tumours, respectively. Statistically significant associations were observed between p53 expression or MIB-1 count and age below 50 years, high-grade tumours, medullary carcinomas, and absence of hormone receptors. p53 mutations were associated with increased MIB-1 count, HER-2/neu oncogene amplification and absence of hormone receptors, but not with age, tumour size or grade, histological subtype, or the number of axillary nodes involved. After a median follow-up of 66 months, p53 expression was observed to be associated with significant increases in risk of both relapse and death from breast cancer, but not after adjusting for the effect of other parameters. In these analyses, MIB-1 count, and not HER-2/neu oncogene amplification, was an independent predictor of prognosis. In node-negative patients, only p53 exon 5 and 6 mutations and MIB-1 count were associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of death from breast cancer, independent of tumour size and ER concentration.

        "Doc_abstract":"The effectiveness of therapies targeting specific pathways in breast cancer, such as the estrogen receptor or HER2, is limited because many tumors manifest resistance, either de novo or acquired, during the course of treatment. To investigate molecular mechanisms of resistance, we used two xenograft models of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, one with and one without HER2 overexpression (MCF7/HER2-18 and MCF7 wt, respectively). Mice with established tumors were assigned to the following treatment groups: estrogen supplementation (E2), estrogen deprivation (ED), ED plus tamoxifen (Tam), all with or without the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (G). Another group received ED plus the antiestrogen fulvestrant (MCF7 wt only). Tumors with acquired or de novo resistance to these endocrine therapies were profiled for gene expression and compared with tumors in the E2 control group. One class of genes underexpressed in endocrine-resistant tumors (relative to E2-treated tumors) were estrogen inducible in vitro and associated with ER+ human breast cancers (luminal subtype). Another class of genes overexpressed in tumors with acquired resistance in both models represented transcriptional targets of HER2 signaling and was associated with ER-/HER2+ human cancers (ERBB2+ subtype). A third class of genes overexpressed in MCF7/HER2-18 tumors exhibiting de novo resistance to tamoxifen was associated with ER+ human cancers but not with estrogen-regulated genes. Thus, in response to various endocrine therapy regimens, these xenograft breast tumors shut down classic estrogen signaling and activate alternative pathways such as HER2 that contribute to treatment resistance. Over time, the molecular phenotype of breast cancer can change.",

A 51-year-old premenopausal female, who had a history of partial mastectomy for right breast cancer at the age of 40, was referred to Toyama City Hospital (Toyoma, Japan) for an endoscopic diagnosis of gastric linitis plastica. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed left hydronephrosis, while peritoneal metastasis and malignant ascites were not detected. Chest CT detected a left lung tumor, which had invaded the left upper bronchus. Biopsy specimens were obtained and the histopathological findings on both the gastric tumor and lung tumor demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, whereas the histology of the original breast cancer was IDC with a solid-tubular type. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the biopsied specimens of the gastric and lung tumors were positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and negative for human epithelial growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). These molecular characteristics indicated the case was metastatic gastric carcinoma from the breast cancer with lung metastasis, since the statuses of ER, PgR and HER2 were concordant with those of the original breast cancer. However, the possibility of primary gastric cancer could not be completely ruled out. Therefore, a total gastrectomy was performed for the purpose of both diagnosis and treatment.

A majority of clinically HER2-positive tumors were scored as FASN overexpressors in a series of almost 200 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Re-classification of HER2-positive breast tumors based on FASN gene expression predicted a significantly inferior relapse-free and distant metastasis-free survival in HER2+/FASN+ patients. Notably, non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells engineered to overexpress HER2 upregulated FASN gene expression, and the FASN inhibitor C75 abolished HER2-induced anchorage-independent growth and survival. Furthermore, in the presence of high concentrations of C75, HER2-negative MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2 (MCF-7/HER2) had significantly higher levels of apoptosis than HER2-negative cells. Finally, C75 at non-cytotoxic concentrations significantly reduced the capacity of MCF-7/HER2 cells to form mammospheres, an in vitro indicator of cancer stem-like cells.

Analysis of paired breast cancer and blood samples from informative (G1170C heterozygotic) ERBB2-positive (n = 12) and ERBB2-negative (n = 17) cases not only confirmed monoallelic amplification and ERBB2 transcriptional overexpression but also revealed that most low ERBB2 expressing breast cancers (12/17) exhibit unbalanced allelic transcription, showing 3-fold to nearly 5,000-fold preferential expression from one of two inherited alleles. To explore cis-acting transcriptional mechanisms potentially selected during ERBB2 amplification, levels of four different ERBB2 transcript variants (5.2, 4.7, 2.1, and 1.4 kb) were correlated with total (4.6 kb) ERBB2 mRNA levels in ERBB2-positive (n = 14) versus ERBB2-negative (n = 43) primary breast cancers. Relative expression of only the 2.1 kb extracellular domain-encoding splice variant and a 4.7 kb mRNA variant that uses an alternative start site were significantly increased in association with ERBB2-positivity, implicating altered promoter usage and selective transcript regulation within the ERBB2 amplicon.

Compared to the ER+/PR+/HER- subtype, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of cancer mortality was 2.14 (1.13, 4.03) for ER-/PR-/HER2- subtype, 1.92 (1.03, 3.59) for ER-/PR-/HER2+ subtype and 5.19 (1.51, 17.86) for ER-/PR+/HER2+ subtype.;In this study, breast cancer cases with ER-/HER2+ tumors had shorter survival than those with ER+/PR+/HER2- tumors. Triple negative tumors were the only other subtype with a statistically significant poorer prognosis. The results of this study in a middle-income country further indicate the importance of receptor status, in particular HER2 status, in the prognosis of breast cancer.",

All specimens scored as 2+ were also routinely evaluated by FISH with use of a HER-2/neu DNA probe kit (PathVysion). Specimens were determined to be amplified if the ratio of HER-2/neu signals to chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) signals was higher than 2.0.;Thirty-eight percent of the specimens evaluated with the HercepTest were scored 0, 35% were 1+, 14% were 2+, and 13% were 3+.

Heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER family members results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of signal transduction pathways. HER2 overexpression increases the translation of fatty acid synthase (FASN), and FASN overexpression markedly increases HER2 signaling, which results in enhanced cell growth. However, the molecular mechanism and regulation of HER2 and FASN interaction are not well defined. Lapatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 in breast cancer cells, resulting in apoptosis. We hypothesized that FASN is directly phosphorylated by HER2, resulting in enhanced signaling and tumor progression in breast cancer cells.;Using mass spectrometry, we identified FASN as one of the proteins that is dephosphorylated by lapatinib in SKBR3 breast cancer cells. Immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, a kinase assay, a FASN enzymatic activity assay, an invasion assay, a cell viability assay and zymography were used to determine the role of FASN phosphorylation in invasion of SKBR3 and BT474 cells. The FASN inhibitor C75 and small interfering RNA were used to downregulate FASN expression and/or activity.;Our data demonstrated that FASN is phosphorylated when it is in complex with HER2. FASN phosphorylation was induced by heregulin in HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 and BT474 breast cancer cells. Heregulin-induced FASN phosphorylation resulted in increased FASN enzymatic activity, which was inhibited by lapatinib. The FASN inhibitor C75 suppressed FASN activity by directly inhibiting HER2 and FASN phosphorylation. Blocking FASN phosphorylation and activity by lapatinib or C75 suppressed the activity of matrix metallopeptidase 9 and inhibited invasion of SKBR3 and BT474 cells.;FASN phosphorylation by HER2 plays an important role in breast cancer progression and may be a novel therapeutic target in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.",

To determine the cut-off for altered mRNA expression, a normalized HER-2 expression value was determined for 20 normal breast tissue RNAs.

More than 38% (17/44) displayed strong overexpression, 25% (11/44) moderate and 36.3% (16/44) normal expression. Compared to IHC, only 7/44 cases were slightly discordant: strong mRNA overexpression/2+ protein staining (1 case), moderate overexpression/ 1+ (3 cases) and moderate overexpression/3+ (3 cases).

OOS reduced the proliferation of these cells, and augmented the action of lapatinib, a HER2 inhibitor used in the breast cancer clinic. Moreover, OOS decreased growth of HER2+ tumors in mice. Mechanistically, OOS provoked cell cycle blockade through upregulation of p27 expression and downregulation of cyclin D levels. OOS also caused apoptotic cell death in HER2+ breast cancer cells, as indicated by increases in PARP cleavage as well as upregulation of caspase 8 and caspase 3 activities. These results demonstrate an antitumoral action of OOS in preclinical models of HER2+ breast cancer and suggest that it can be used with anti-HER2 therapies currently adopted as standard of care in the oncology clinic.

The main aim of the present study was to classify breast cancer into molecular subtypes based on immunohistochemistry findings and correlate the subtypes with clinicopathological factors. Two hundred and seventeen primary breast carcinomas tumor tissues were immunostained for ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, EGFR, CK8/18, p53 and Ki67 using tissue microarray technique. All subtypes were significantly associated with Malay ethnic background (p=0.035) compared to other racial origins. The most common subtypes of breast cancers were luminal A and was significantly associated with low histological grade (p<0.000) and p53 negativity (p=0.003) compared to HER2+/ER-, basal-like and normal-like subtypes with high histological grade (p<0.000) and p53 positivity (p=0.003). Luminal B subtype had the smallest mean tumor size (p=0.009) and also the highest mean number of lymph nodes positive (p=0.032) compared to other subtypes. All markers except EGFR and Ki67 were significantly associated with the subtypes. The most common histological type was infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NOS. Majority of basal-like subtype showed comedo-type necrosis (68.8%) and infiltrative margin (81.3%). Our studies suggest that IHC can be used to identify the different subtypes of breast cancer and all subtypes were significantly associated with race, mean tumor size, mean number of lymph node positive, histological grade and all immunohistochemical markers except EGFR and Ki67.",

We used the 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) scoring criteria to evaluate HER2 amplification status in 175 cases of breast carcinoma with chromosome 17 polysomy. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine the HER2 amplification status, and 2-color FISH to detect CEP17, and reviewed the results of initial evaluation using the 2007 ASCO/CAP criteria. Of the 175 cases, 17, 95, and 63 were IHC 0/1+, 2+, and 3+, respectively. Evaluation of IHC HER2 status according to the 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria identified significantly more HER2-positive cases compared to cases evaluated using the 2007 criteria (p<0.05). When the FISH results were evaluated in parallel with the 2013 criteria, we found that 22 cases were not HER2-negative despite the presence of polysomy 17, which, according to the 2013 criteria, indicates HER2-positive status. Our findings indicate that in breast carcinoma, HER2 status in the presence of polysomy 17 may vary with the scoring criteria used. In turn, performing FISH and evaluating samples using the 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria means that more patients with breast cancer may be appropriate for targeted treatment with trastuzumab, potentially improving their outcome.

One of the most interesting targets for the design of anticancer therapeutics is the HER2/ErbB2 receptor which is overexpressed in about 20-25% of breast cancers. Given the poor prognosis of women whose tumors express ErbB2 (HER2) at high levels, accurate determination of the ErbB2 status should be routinely performed in women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer. Efficacy and safety data of numerous trials led to the approval of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab as the first ErbB2-targeting therapy in ErbB2-positive breast cancer. However, the majority of patients who achieve an initial response to trastuzumab-based regimens for metastatic disease develop resistance within 1 year. This underlines the need for alternative or additional anti-ErbB2-targeting strategies.",

Lapatinib is a potent dual inhibitor of HER-2 and EGFR. Preclinical and phase I studies have shown activity with lapatinib in a number of cancers, including breast cancer, and the drug is well tolerated. The main known drug interactions are with paclitaxel and irinotecan. The most significant side-effects of lapatinib are diarrhea and adverse skin events. Rates of cardiotoxicity compare favorably with trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against HER-2. This paper focuses on lapatinib in advanced and metastatic breast cancer, which remains an important therapeutic challenge. Phase II and III studies show activity as monotherapy, and in combination with chemotherapy or hormonal agents. Results from these studies suggest that the main benefit from lapatinib is in the HER-2 positive breast cancer population. Combinations of lapatinib and trastuzumab are also being studied and show encouraging results, particularly in trastuzumab-refractory metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib may have a specific role in treating HER-2 positive CNS metastases. The role of lapatinib as neoadjuvant therapy and in early breast cancer is also being evaluated.",

The recently isolated lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1), the most important enzyme in membrane biogenesis, has been currently implicated in cancer development and progression. The published literature lacks comprehensive reports on LPCAT1 expression in breast cancer and its impact on patients' outcome. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of LPCAT1 in 80 primary breast carcinomas, 24 metastatic lymph nodes, and 30 non-neoplastic breast tissue specimens and statistically analyzed the association between LPCAT1 expression and clinicopathological variables and patients' outcome. LPCAT1 protein was significantly upregulated in primary breast carcinoma and showed a significant ascending pattern being the lowest in normal breast tissues, relatively increased in fibrocystic disease, and the highest in primary carcinoma. LPCAT1 expression was significantly higher at tumor's advancing edge and correlated positively with tumor's grade and TNM stage. Compared to primary tumor, LPCAT1 expression was significantly lower in ductal carcinoma in situ and significantly higher in metastatic lymph nodes. LPCAT1 overexpression was significantly associated with increased proliferative activity, negative estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, as well as triple-negative and HER2 disease molecular subtypes. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced stage, high grade, and LPCAT1 overexpression were independent predictors of early tumor recurrence. We conclude that LPCAT1 is implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis, evolution, and progression and appears to play a potentially crucial role as a determinant of local invasiveness and metastasis. LPCAT1 is an independent predictor of early tumor recurrence of breast carcinoma and represents a novel prognostic biomarker that reflects underlying biological alterations and thus constitutes a potentially promising target for new therapeutic strategies.",

Abnormal HER2 activation, either through HER2 overexpression or heregulin (HRG):HER3 binding, elicits the formation of potent HER2-HER3 heterodimers and drives breast cancer cell growth and metastasis. In a previous study, we found that fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, was frequently overexpressed in human HER2+ breast tumors. We report here that HER2 and Fn14 are also coexpressed in mammary tumors that develop in two different transgenic mouse models of breast cancer. In consideration of these findings, we investigated whether HER2 activation in breast cancer cells could directly induce Fn14 gene expression. We found that transient or stable transfection of MCF7 cells with a HER2 expression plasmid increased Fn14 protein levels. Also, HRG1-β1 treatment of MCF7 cells transiently induced Fn14 mRNA and protein expression. Both the HER2- and HRG1-β1-induced increase in Fn14 expression in MCF7 cells as well as basal Fn14 expression in HER2 gene-amplified AU565 cells could be reduced by HER2 kinase inhibition with lapatinib or combined HER2 and HER3 depletion using siRNA. We also report that Fn14-depleted, HER2-overexpressing MCF7 cells have reduced basal cell migration capacity and reduced HRG1-β1-stimulated cell migration, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression. Together, these results indicate that Fn14 may be an important downstream regulator of HER2/HER3-driven breast cancer cell migration and invasion.",

The prognostic relevance of ERBB2-regulated and all additional Bcl-2 family members was determined in 782 patients with untreated node-negative breast cancer. The biological relevance of ERBB2-induced inhibition of apoptosis was validated in a murine tumor model allowing conditional ERBB2 expression.;ERBB2 caused an antiapoptotic phenotype by upregulation of MCL-1, TEGT, BAG1, BNIP1, and BECN1 as well as downregulation of BAX, BMF, BNIPL, CLU, and BCL2L13. Upregulation of the antiapoptotic MCL-1 [P = 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) 1.5] and BNIP3 (P = 0.024; HR, 1.4) was associated with worse prognosis considering metastasis-free interval, whereas clusterin (P = 0.008; HR, 0.88) and the proapoptotic BCL2L13 (P = 0.019; HR, 0.45) were associated with better prognosis.

First-degree family history was similarly and significantly associated with an increased risk of all the subtypes [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43-2.09, HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.54-1.70, and HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15-2.13, for triple-negative, ER+, and ER-/PR-/HER2+, respectively]. Risk of all the subtypes was most pronounced among women with at least two affected first-degree relatives (versus women with no affected first-degree relatives, HR(triple-negative) = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.66-4.27, HR(ER+) = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.79-2.36, HR(ER)-(/PR)-(/HER2+) = 2.25, 95% CI: 0.99-5.08). Having a first-degree family history of breast cancer was associated with an increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer with a magnitude of association similar to that for the predominant ER+ subtype and ER-/PR-/HER2+ breast cancer.",

Members of both receptor classes are important prognostic factors in human breast cancer. Clinical data indicate that overexpression of the HER-2 gene is associated with an estrogen receptor-negative phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that introduction of a HER-2 cDNA, converting non-overexpressing breast cancer cells to those which overexpress this receptor, results in development of estrogen-independent growth which is insensitive to both estrogen and the antiestrogen, tamoxifen. Moreover, activation of the HER-2 receptor in breast cancer cells by the peptide growth factor, heregulin, leads to direct and rapid phosphorylation of ER on tyrosine residues. This is followed by interaction between ER and the estrogen-response elements in the nucleus and production of an estrogen-induced protein, progesterone receptor. In addition, overexpression of HER-2 receptor in estrogen-dependent tumor cells promotes ligand-independent down-regulation of ER and a delayed autoregulatory suppression of ER transcripts. These data demonstrate a direct link between these two receptor pathways and suggest one mechanism for development of endocrine resistance in human breast cancers.",

One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1 (ref. 2) and its substrate XBP1 (ref. 3). Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumours, but the role of XBP1 in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)--a form of breast cancer in which tumour cells do not express the genes for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 (also called ERBB2 or NEU)--is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. Here we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and has a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumour growth and tumour relapse and reduced the CD44(high)CD24(low) population. Hypoxia-inducing factor 1α (HIF1α) is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1α that regulates the expression of HIF1α targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1α and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and indicate that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer.",

Overexpression of HER2 has been found to serve as a target for developing trastuzumab to treat 20-25% of breast cancer. However, little or none of the other membrane receptor was found to be useful as a potential target for breast cancer treatment since then. Here, we showed that amplified signaling of interleukin-17 receptor B (IL-17RB) and its ligand IL-17B promoted tumorigenicity in breast cancer cells and impeded acinus formation in immortalized normal mammary epithelial cells. External signal transmitted through IL-17RB activated nuclear factor-κB to upregulate antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 and induced etoposide resistance. Elevated expression of IL-17RB had a stronger correlation with poor prognosis than HER2 in breast cancer patients. Interestingly, breast cancer patients with high expression of IL-17RB and HER2 had the shortest survival rate. Depletion of IL-17RB in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells significantly reduced their tumorigenic activity, suggesting that IL-17RB and HER2 have an independent role in breast carcinogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with antibodies specifically against IL-17RB or IL-17B effectively attenuated tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that the amplified IL-17RB/IL-17B signaling pathways may serve as a therapeutic target for developing treatment to manage IL-17RB-associated breast cancer.",

We inserted the sequence for neu into a novel plasmid called ELVIS containing a Sindbis virus replicon that reproduces multiple copies of mRNA. Mice vaccinated one time intramuscularly demonstrated a strong antibody response against A2L2, a murine breast cancer cell line transfected to express neu. Vaccinated mice challenged in the mammary fatpad with A2L2 had reduced tumor incidence and reduced tumor mass compared to mice challenged with tumor cells lacking the neu insert. Intradermal vaccination was also protective and required 80% less plasmid for a similar level of protection. Vaccination reduced the incidence of lung metastasis from mammary fatpad tumors and reduced the number of lung metastases resulting from intravenous injection of A2L2 cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes cultures of immune spleen cells with P815-neu cells produced high levels of interferon-gamma indicating an antigen-specific Th1-type immune response resulting from the vaccination.

Moreover, the systemic delivery of CXCR4si by e23sFv-9R is able to suppress tumor growth, reduce metastasis and prolong survival in mice bearing HER2(+) xenografts.

We induced CTLs from CD8(+)cells of HLA-A24 healthy donors by stimulation with HE1-pulsed autologous dendritic cells. The CTLs showed cytotoxic activity against not only the peptide-pulsed target cells but also HLA-A24 colorectal tumour cell lines that endogenously overexpressed HER2 / neu.

Interpretable AIB1 expression obtained in 395 patients was analysed along with other prognostic factors in breast cancer.;AIB1 expression scores ranged from 0 to 30; positive AIB1 expression (score > 14) was seen in 146/395 breast cancers; it correlated negatively with ER (P = 0.003) and progesterone receptor (PR) (P = 0.007), and positively with HER-2 (P = 0.005) and tumour grade (P = 0.014). It did not correlate with nodal status (P = 0.437). Among ER+ patients, AIB1 expression showed a trend towards loss of PR expression (29% versus 20%; P = 0.14). AIB1 did not predict survival on univariate or multivariate analysis.;AIB1 expression correlates with HER-2 expression in breast cancer and shows a trend of association with loss of PR expression in ER+ tumours. Our study supports the postulated role of AIB1 in ER-growth factor interactions.",

Aberrant activation of pAkt is associated with various malignant human cancers, including breast carcinoma. In vitro studies show that pAkt activation is mediated by estrogen and acts as a downstream effector of HER2 with implications in breast cancer progression and drug resistance. We investigated the incidence of Akt activation in invasive ductal carcinoma and its correlation with other clinicopathological variables. Using tissue microarray technology, immunohistochemical expression of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) at Ser-473 was evaluated in 127 cases of invasive ductal carcinomas, together with hormone receptors, HER2, p53, Ki-67 and other clinicopathological variables. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression was noted for pAkt, with 46 cases (36.2%) showing high cytoplasmic pAkt expression and 37 cases (29.1%) showing high nuclear pAkt expression. There was a significant association between both high cytoplasmic and nuclear pAkt expression with HER2 overexpression (both p<0.0001). There was also a positive correlation between high nuclear pAkt expression with both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status (p=0.042 and p=0.015, respectively). High cytoplasmic pAkt expression was associated with high Ki-67 expression (p=0.052), however, there was no association between pAkt and p53 expression. In the present study, activation of the Akt pathway shows strong association with HER2 overexpression, which is consistent with many in vitro studies. Our study also showed a positive correlation between pAkt and hormone receptors, which suggested the possible mechanism of endocrine resistance in ER-positive breast cancer. These results also suggest the prognostic value of pAkt and its importance in the prediction of therapeutic response in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.",

The focus of this study was to utilize our inducible model of IGF-IR overexpression to explore the interaction of these two potent oncogenes.;ErbB2 was overexpressed in our RM11A cell line, a murine tumor cell line that overexpresses human IGF-IR in an inducible manner. ErbB2 conferred an accelerated tumor onset and increased tumor incidence after injection of RM11A cells into the mammary glands of syngeneic wild type mice. This was associated with increased proliferation immediately after tumor cell colonization of the mammary gland; however, this effect was lost after tumor establishment. ErbB2 overexpression also impaired the regression of established RM11A tumors following IGF-IR downregulation and enhanced their metastatic potential.;This study has revealed that even in the presence of vast IGF-IR overexpression, a modest increase in ErbB2 can augment tumor establishment in vivo, mediate resistance to IGF-IR downregulation and facilitate metastasis. This supports the growing evidence suggesting a possible advantage of using IGF-IR and ErbB2-directed therapies concurrently in the treatment of breast cancer.",

The HER2 protein is a viable therapeutic target. The humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) has demonstrated activity in clinical trials in women with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2. The mechanisms of the action of this antibody involve disruption of DNA repair and induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Response rates to the antibody given as a single agents in the treatment of HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer have ranged from 12 to 27%. Patients who received trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy had a significantly longer time to progression, higher overall survival compared with patients who had received chemotherapy alone. In the treatment of women with HER2 overexpressing tumors an overall response rate of 57% for combination trastuzumab plus paclitaxel compared with 25% for paclitaxel alone was found. Trastuzumab has an important role in the treatment of HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Its place in adjuvant treatment has not been proved up to now. The optimal use of trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2 positive advanced breast cancer is under active investigation.

The HER-2 (also known as ErbB2/c-erbB2/HER-2/neu) oncogene is the most frequently amplified oncogene in breast cancer and is also commonly amplified in other forms of cancer. Alongside its important role in tumor induction, growth and progression, HER-2 is also a target for a new form of chemotherapy. Since 1998, breast cancer patients have been treated with considerable success with Herceptin (trastuzumab), a recombinant antibody designed to block signaling through the HER-2 receptor. In addition to Herceptin, a large number of various HER-2 directed immunological and genetic approaches, either targeting the HER-2 receptor, its signaling pathways or both HER-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) together, have demonstrated promising pre-clinical potential towards HER-2 amplified carcinomas. Moreover, the HER-2 amplicon contains other genes with altered copy numbers that could be used as targets for chemotherapy. The topoisomerase IIalpha (topoIIalpha) gene (TOP2A) is located adjacent to the HER-2 oncogene at the chromosome location 17q12-q21 and is either amplified or deleted, with equal frequency, in almost 90% of HER-2 amplified primary breast tumors. Recent data suggest that amplification or deletion of TOP2A may account for both sensitivity or resistance to topoII-inhibitor-chemotherapy, depending on the specific genetic defect at the TOP2A locus. The understanding of HER-2 amplification and its role in the pathogenesis of cancer is expanding. The number of therapeutic strategies targeting HER-2 signaling pathways will most probably be introduced in the treatment of HER-2 amplified tumors within the next few years. Combining HER-2 targeting therapies with conventional forms of cytotoxic chemotherapy, where additional diagnostics tests such as those ascertaining topoIIalpha status, may be helpful for the ideal selection of patients for the combination therapy of a HER-2 targeting drug together with a cytotoxic drug. The clinical and therapeutic importance of the HER-2 and TOPO2A status of tumor cells in cancer management will only increase within the next few years.",

Intratumoral heterogeneity of HER-2 status was identified in three cases by CISH. The results of the three procedures were compared and showed a concordance rate of 83.8%; higher discordances were observed in 0 or 1+ immunostaining cases, which showed high-level amplification (15.4%) and HER-2 transcript overexpression (20%).

Cell viability was examined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The binding between SHP-1 and EGFR/HER-2 was evaluated by immunoprecipitation assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The effects of SHP-1 on tumorigenicity and trastuzumab sensitivity were confirmed via in vivo xenograft model.;Trastuzumab-resistant SKBr-3 cells showed aberrant co-expression of EGFR and HER-2.

Meanwhile, SHP-1 overexpression reduced phosphorylation levels of EGFR and HER-2 both in parental and trastuzumab-resistant SKBr-3 cells. In vivo study showed an increased antitumor effect of trastuzumab in SHP-1 overexpressed xenografts. At last, we discovered that SHP-1 can make complexes with both EGFR and HER-2, and both phospho-EGFR and phosphor-HER-2 levels in wild-type SHP-1 immunoprecipitates were less than those in phosphatase-inactive SHP-1 (C453S) immunoprecipitates, indicating that EGFR and HER-2 are potential substrates of SHP-1.;Taken together, we have demonstrated that the SHP-1 is a negative regulatory factor of the tyrosine kinase activity of HER-2 and EGFR through inhibiting phosphorylation. Dual targeting of EGFR and HER-2, by combining trastuzumab with SHP-1 overexpression, may improve response in HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer cells that also express high levels of EGFR.",

In 10 patients with HER-2-positive tumors, the HER-2/chromosome enumerator probe 17 ratio in each tumor was about twice that of the corresponding CTCs (mean 6.64 +/- 2.72 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.6). Hence, the ratio of the CTCs is a reliable surrogate marker for the expected high ratio in the primary tumor. Her-2 protein expression of 10 CTCs was sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of the HER-2 gene status of the whole population of CTCs in 19 patients with recurrent breast cancer.

A recent pilot clinical trial assessing the effects of ALA-rich dietary flaxseed on tumor biological markers in postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer demonstrated significant reductions in tumor growth and in HER2 (erbB-2) oncogene expression.;The molecular mechanism by which ALA inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis formation may involve a direct regulation of HER2, a well-characterized oncogene playing a key role in the etiology, progression and response to some chemo- and endocrine therapies in approximately 20% of breast carcinomas.;Using HER2-specific ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, RT-PCR and HER2 promoter-reporter analyses, we characterized the effects of exogenous supplementation with ALA on the expression of HER2 oncogene, a master key player in the onset and metastasis formation of breast cancer disease. Metabolic status (MTT) assays were performed to evaluate the nature of the cytotoxic interaction between ALA and the humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). To study these issues we used BT-474 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells, which naturally exhibit amplification of the HER2 oncogene.;ALA treatment dramatically suppressed the expression of HER2-coded p185Her-2/neu oncoprotein as determined by ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting techniques. Interestingly, ALA-induced down-regulation of p185Her-2/neu correlated with a transcriptional response as no HER2 mRNA signal could be detected by RT-PCR upon treatment with optimal concentrations of ALA (up to 20 microM). Consistent with these findings, ALA exposure was found to dramatically repress the activity of a Luciferase reporter gene driven by the HER2 promoter. Moreover, the nature of the cytotoxic interaction between ALA and trastuzumab (Herceptin) revealed a significant synergism as assessed by MTT-based cell viability assays.;i) These findings reveal that the omega-3 PUFA ALA suppresses overexpression of HER2 oncogene at the transcriptional level, which, in turn, interacts synergistically with anti-HER2 trastuzumab- based immunotherapy. ii) Our results molecularly support a recent randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial suggesting that ALA may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used drugs in the management of HER2-positive breast carcinomas. iii) Considering our previous findings demonstrating the <<HER2 upregulatory actions>> of the omega-6 PUFA linolenic acid (LA; 18:2n-6) and the <<HER2 down-regulatory actions >> of the omega-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and of the omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (OA; 18:1n-9), it is reasonable to suggest that a low omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio and elevated MUFA levels, the two prominent <<fat features>> of the <<Mediterranean diet>>, should be extremely efficient at blocking HER2 expression in breast cancer cells.",

Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, significantly improves survival in HER2-positive breast cancer. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to evolve anti-HER2 therapies, as the disease may progress. Pertuzumab inhibits HER2 by binding to a different HER2 epitope than trastuzumab and represents a complementary mechanism of action to trastuzumab.

Our aims were to determine tumor marker phenotype concordance between first and second primary breast cancers (FPBC and SPBC), describe demographic and clinical characteristics, and examine first tumor treatments associated with phenotype concordance. A total of 76,209 cases of female invasive breast cancer were identified in the California Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2004. Of those, 1,407 women who had not undergone a prophylactic mastectomy, had information on the status of three tumor markers, and were diagnosed with an SPBC during the study period were selected. SPBCs were significantly smaller, diagnosed at a higher stage and were node positive. Patients whose FPBC was ER(+)/-/PR(+)/-/HER2- and triple negative (TN) (ER-/PR-/HER2-), often had concordant phenotypes for their SPBC. ER(+)/-/PR(+)/-/HER2+ and HER2-positive (ER-/PR-/HER2+) FPBCs, often had discordant phenotypes for their SPBC. ER(+)/-/PR(+)/-/HER2- SPBCs often lacked HER2 expression and were ER and/or PR positive. Tumor laterality and synchronicity significantly predicted concordance as did having a FPBC whose phenotypes were ER(+)/-/PR(+)/-/HER2+, HER2-positive and TN, while first primary tumor treatment with chemotherapy predicted discordance. The relationship between multiple primary breast cancer phenotype concordance and patient prognosis has yet to be determined. Our results indicate that SPBC surveillance strategies include consideration of FPBC phenotype.

In this study, therefore, iron dependency in HER2 overexpression and CSC survival is examined in breast cancer cell line, MCF7. It has shown that cells overexpressing HER2 require iron more than their vector counterparts and HER2-increased CSCs are vulnerable to iron chelation. Additionally, this sensitivity of CSCs to iron reduction is obviously indicated in various breast cancer cell lines; HCC1954, MDA-MB-435 and Hs578T.

Results of previous studies have been mixed, with most studies showing no association but some suggesting an association in younger women or women with a family history of breast cancer.;We conducted an association study of HER2 codon 655 genotype and breast cancer within the Carolina Breast Cancer study, a population-based, case-control study of in situ and invasive breast cancer in African American and white women in North Carolina. A total of 2015 cases and 1808 controls were genotyped.;We observed no overall association between HER2 genotype and breast cancer. However, a modest positive association (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.3) was observed for Val/Val + Ile/Val versus Ile/Ile genotypes in women age 45 or younger with a family history of breast cancer. Val/Val homozygotes were more common among cases with in situ versus invasive disease (P = 0.002). Breast tumors from women with Val/Val genotype were more likely to exhibit HER2 overexpression, but the results were not statistically significant (P = 0.17).;The HER2 codon 655 polymorphism may be one of many low-penetrant genes that make a minor contribution to breast cancer, particularly in subgroups of women. Additional large studies, as well as data pooling, will be needed to estimate the contribution of such genes to breast cancer risk.",

There has been a sharp increase in the detection of breast carcinoma, although mortality is still unvaried. In the last ten years the incidence of breast cancer measuring less than 1 cm, corresponding to pT1a, pT1b in TNM stadiation, has greatly increased. The present study describes the biologic characterisation of small breast carcinomas. The Nottingham/Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Study stated that tumour size is a significant, independent factor for breast cancer prognosis. Cases were selected among formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 360 ductal breast cancers. In one-half of cases, the tumour was less than 1 cm in diameter, pT1a- pT1b; in the other half the tumour size was greater than 1 cm, but less than 2 cm, pT1c. Histological grading was assessed with the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson method, without Nottingham grade. Immunohistochemical determinations for ER, PgR, Ki-67, Her-2/Neu, CD34, p53, EGFR were done with an automated method. From the above analyses, it was demonstrated that the tumour size is indeed an important prognostic factor, particularly in cases without lymph node metastasis (N0). In particular, we observed significant differences between pT1a-b and pT1c cases, confirming that tumour size is an important criterion for prognostic valuation in ductal breast cancer without lymph node metastasis.",

In this study, the method is applied to signal detection of the HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) gene, whose amplification is one of the most common genetic alterations associated with human breast cancer. Nuclei were extracted and isolated from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue of 43 different carcinomas (breast, ovary, endometrium, gastrointestinal stromal tumor and malignant mesothelioma). FISH was performed both on sections and extracted nuclei of each tissue using chromosome enumeration probes (CEP) for the centromeric regions of chromosomes 8 and 17, and a locus specific identifier (LSI) for the HER-2/neu oncogene. Differences between ploidy calculated in sections and extracted nuclei were seen in 3 breast carcinomas and 1 gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Furthermore, 1 breast cancer, previously considered to be borderline for HER-2/neu gene amplification turned out to be clearly amplified. Nuclei extraction and isolation bypass all the problems related to signal interpretation in tissue sections, and the adoption of this new technique, which improves the signal quality in several neoplastic samples, is suggested.",

Recent studies show that aberrant activation of Akt in breast carcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. The Akt signaling pathway is currently attracting considerable attention as a new target for effective therapeutic strategies. We investigated the incidence of Akt activation in 252 primary breast carcinomas and relationships among the activation of Akt, HER2 overexpression, hormone receptor expression, and alteration of the PTEN gene. Eighty-four cases (33.3%) were positive for pAkt expression. pAkt was significantly associated with HER2 overexpression (p<0.0001) and LOH at the PTEN gene locus (p<0.01). There was an inverse correlation between pAkt and PR (p<0.05). We also retrospectively examined the relationship between Akt activation and the efficacy of endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Of these 36 metastatic breast cancer cases, 12 cases (33.4%) were considered to show positive pAkt expression. In the pAkt-positive patients, endocrine therapy demonstrated worse efficacy than in pAkt-negative patients (p<0.01). In addition, the clinical benefit was the smallest in the patients positive both for HER2 and pAkt (p<0.01). The clinical benefit rate of estrogen deprivation therapy with AI or LH-RH agonist was significantly lower in the pAkt-positive patients than that in the pAkt-negative ones (p<0.05), and there was a tendency for the clinical benefit of SERM to be smaller in the pAkt-positive patients (p=0.09). These findings therefore suggest that Akt activation induces endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer, irrespective of the kind of endocrine agents that were administered. Our findings indicate that the activation of Akt in the downstream pathway of HER2 plays an important role in resistance to endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Our findings suggest that pAkt may be a useful predictor of resistance to endocrine therapy for breast cancer, while also suggesting that the inhibition of Akt may increase the efficacy of endocrine therapy.",

C3G abolished ethanol-mediated p130(Cas)/JNK interaction.;C3G blocks ethanol-induced activation of the ErbB2/cSrc/FAK pathway which is necessary for cell migration/invasion.

Currently, the only accepted mechanism linked with endocrine resistance is amplification or overexpression of the ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) proto-oncogene. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, the most frequently mutated pathway in breast cancer, promotes antiestrogen resistance. PI3K is a major signaling hub downstream of HER2 and other receptor tyrosine kinases. PI3K activates several molecules involved in cell-cycle progression and survival, and in ER-positive breast cancer cells, it promotes estrogen-dependent and -independent ER transcriptional activity. Preclinical tumor models of antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer often remain sensitive to estrogens and PI3K inhibition, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of the PI3K and ER pathways may be most effective. Herein, we review alterations in the PI3K pathway associated with resistance to endocrine therapy, the state of clinical development of PI3K inhibitors, and strategies for the clinical investigation of such drugs in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",

In univariate analysis, HER2 positivity, tumor size, and Ki-67 positivity showed significant correlations with maximum THC (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis including tumor size, and ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67 status, HER2 positivity correlated with maximum THC significantly (p = 0.007, parameter estimate 76.44). Maximum THC correlated with HER2, Ki-67 and tumor size in this group of ductal breast carcinomas. Thus, US-guided diffuse optical tomography (US-DOT) may potentially be used to predict tumor aggressiveness in patients with invasive breast cancers.",

Because c-erbB family growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression is one of the most recognizable molecular dysfunctions in breast tumors, in the studies presented here, we explored the effect of HER2 overexpression on the status of PPARgamma expression and on the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to PPARgamma-ligand troglitazone-induced growth inhibition. We show that HER2 overexpression in MCF7 breast cancer cells enhanced the expression of PPARgamma-mRNA and -protein. Furthermore, PPARgamma expression was dramatically increased in 11 of 16 breast tumors as compared with the adjacent normal tissue. In addition, HER2 up-regulation resulted in a partial inhibition of transcriptional activity of the endogenous PPARgamma, stimulation to differentiation, and resistance to troglitazone-mediated inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Conversely, down-regulation of HER2 by anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody Herceptin led to a decreased level of PPARgamma protein and sensitization of breast cancer cells to the inhibitory effects of troglitazone. In summary, these findings show for the first time that HER2 up-regulates PPARgamma expression and modulates the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to PPARgamma ligand therapy.",

Previous studies demonstrated its regulation through estrogens, suggesting possible importance of NUDT2 in breast carcinoma. NUDT2, however, has not been examined in malignant tissues. Therefore, we examined its expression and functions in breast carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry for NUDT2 was examined by invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC: n = 145) and pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS: n = 82), and NUDT2 mRNA was examined by real-time PCR in 9 DCIS, 19 IDC and 6 non-neoplastic breast tissues. We also used T47D breast carcinoma cells in in vitro studies. NUDT2 immunoreactivity was detected in 78% of DCIS and 63% of IDC, and NUDT2 mRNA level was significantly higher in DCIS or IDC than non-neoplastic breast. NUDT2 status was significantly correlated with Van Nuys classification, HER2 or Ki-67 in DCIS, and with stage, lymph node metastasis, histological grade or HER2 in IDC. NUDT2 status was significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome of IDC patients and proved an independent prognostic factor. Results of transfection experiments demonstrated that proliferation activity of T47D cells was significantly associated with NUDT2 expression level according to the treatment of estradiol and/or tamoxifen. NUDT2 expression was significantly decreased by estradiol, and it was also significantly decreased in T47D cells transfected with HER2 siRNA. These findings suggest that NUDT2 is an estrogen-repressed gene and is also induced by HER2 pathways in breast carcinoma cells. NUDT2 promotes proliferation of breast carcinoma cells and is a potent prognostic factor in human breast carcinomas.",

Immunohistochemical staining for ER, PR, Her-2, and Ki-67 was performed by the DAKO EnVision method.;Among the 103 cases, five patients (4.9%) had a complete response (CR), 82 (79.6%) partial response (PR), 15 (14.6%) stable disease (SD), and one (0.9%) progressive disease (PD), yielding an overall response rate (CR + PR) of 84.5%. Nine patients achieved pathological CR. There was a significant decrease in the average index of Ki-67 postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, compared with that before chemotherapy (24.1% vs. 39.7%, P < 0.001). After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the changes of Ki-67 in different subtypes of breast cancer were different (P < 0.001), and these changes correlated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001).

Trastuzumab, a humanized antibody directed against an epitope on subdomain IV of the extracellular domain of HER2 is used for therapy of HER2-overexpressing mammary tumors. However, many tumors are either natively resistant or acquire resistance against Trastuzumab. Antibodies directed to different epitopes on the extracellular domain of HER2 are promising candidates for replacement or combinatorial therapy. For example, Pertuzumab that binds to subdomain II of HER2 extracellular domain and inhibits receptor dimerization is under clinical trial. Alternative antibodies directed to novel HER2 epitopes may serve as additional tools for breast cancer therapy. Our aim was to generate novel anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells, either alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).;Mice were immunized against SK-BR-3 cells and recombinant HER2 extracellular domain protein to produce monoclonal antibodies. Anti-HER2 antibodies were characterized with breast cancer cell lines using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, western blot techniques. Antibody epitopes were localized using plasmids encoding recombinant HER2 protein variants. Antibodies, either alone or in combination with TNF-α, were tested for their effects on breast cancer cell proliferation.;We produced five new anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, all directed against conformational epitope or epitopes restricted to the native form of the extracellular domain. When tested alone, some antibodies inhibited modestly but significantly the growth of SK-BR-3, BT-474 and MDA-MB-361 cells displaying ERBB2 amplification. They had no detectable effect on MCF-7 and T47D cells lacking ERBB2 amplification. When tested in combination with TNF-α, antibodies acted synergistically on SK-BR-3 cells, but antagonistically on BT-474 cells. A representative anti-HER2 antibody inhibited Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation leading to cyclin D1 accumulation and growth arrest in SK-BR-3 cells, independently from TNF-α.;Novel antibodies against extracellular domain of HER2 may serve as potent anti-cancer bioactive molecules. Cell-dependent synergy and antagonism between anti-HER2 antibodies and TNF-α provide evidence for a complex interplay between HER2 and TNF-α signaling pathways. Such complexity may drastically affect the outcome of HER2-directed therapeutic interventions.",

Considerable interest has developed in searching for novel FASN inhibitors as therapeutic agents in treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Amentoflavone was found to be effective in suppressing FASN expression in HER2-positive SKBR3 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of FASN by amentoflavone specifically down-regulated HER2 protein and mRNA, and caused an up-regulation of PEA3, a transcriptional repressor of HER2. In addition, pharmacological blockade of FASN by amentoflavone preferentially decreased cell viability and induced cell death in SKBR3 cells. Palmitate reduced the cytotoxic effect of amentoflavone, as the percentage of viable cells was increased after the addition of exogenous palmitate. Amentoflavone-induced FASN inhibition inhibited the translocation of SREBP-1 in SKBR3 cells. Amentoflavone inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and JNK. The use of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that the modulation of AKT, mTOR, and JNK phosphorylation required synergistic amentoflavone-induced FASN inhibition and HER2 activation in SKBR3 cells. These results suggest that amentoflavone modulated FASN expression by regulation of HER2-pathways, and induced cell death to enhance chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic activity in HER2-positive breast cancers.",

SISH is technically comparable to fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) but does not require a fluorescence microscope for its interpretation. Although recent studies on histologic evaluations of SISH are promising, we aimed to evaluate its performance on 71 cytologic breast cancer specimens with the new combined Her-2/Chr17 probe. Her-2/neu status as routinely determined by FISH was available for all patients. We found SISH signals in cytologic cell blocks and smear specimens easy to evaluate in most cases. Small numbers of tumor cells and difficulties in identifying tumor cells in lymphocyte-rich backgrounds were limiting factors. Her-2/neu status, as determined by Her-2/Chr17 SISH, was basically identical to the results of the corresponding FISH. The discrepancies were mainly owing to the heterogeneity of Her-2/neu amplification in the tumor tissue. Interobserver agreement for the SISH evaluation was high (kappa value: 0.972). We conclude that Her-2/Chr17 SISH is a useful and accurate method for the evaluation of the Her-2/neu gene amplification status in cytologic breast cancer specimens, particularly in metastatic breast cancer lesions. The advantages of signal permanency and bright-field microscopic result interpretation make this technique an attractive alternative to the current FISH-based gold standard.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in many industrialized countries. Approximately one fourth of all women diagnosed with early breast cancer present with tumors that are characterized by erbB2 amplification. While the associated Her-2/neu receptor overexpression results in a high risk of relapse and poor prognosis, these tumors also represent a target for a selective monoclonal antibody therapy with trastuzumab (Herceptin). The combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy has led to a considerable reduction of recurrences and to a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality both in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. Unfortunately, despite Her-2/neu overexpression, not all patients equally benefit from trastuzumab treatment, and almost all women with metastatic breast cancer eventually progress during antibody therapy. Moreover, trastuzumab is burdened with cardiotoxicity, thus increasing the risk of symptomatic congestive heart failure. In addition, the marginal costs for a 1 year therapy of trastuzumab-based therapy, which is currently considered to be the most effective treatment regimen in the adjuvant setting, may amount for up to US$ 40.000. Testing for erbB2 oncogene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), respectively, and staining for Her-2/neu receptor overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) represent the current standard for determining patient eligibility for trastuzumab-based therapy. However, while the negative predictive value of these assays for predicting the absence of benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy is sufficiently high, their positive predictive value remains insufficient, i.e. only a proportion of patients selected by these tests substantially benefit from trastuzumab-containing regimen. Accordingly, over the last years a number of biomarkers have been evaluated in their potential to predict response to trastuzumab-based therapies. These include markers auf activation of Her-2/neu (e.g., tyrosine phosphorylated Her-2/neu in tissue and cleaved Her-2/neu extracellular domain in serum) and its dimerization partners (e.g., EGFR), respectively, but also components of Her-2/neu-induced downstream signaling pathways that are crucial for the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab (e.g., PTEN and PI3K). Other parameters, such as topoisomerase-II alpha and c-myc co-amplifications, have also been identified as potentially useful predictors of response to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen. While the benefit of these predictive biomarkers in the metastatic setting is currently explored, their usefulness in the adjuvant setting is still largely unknown. It is, however, undisputable that, within the group of Her-2/neu overexpressing tumors, further response predictors are needed in order to minimize trastuzumab-associated side effects, and to reduce the considerable societal costs that are associated with trastuzumab-based treatment regimen.",

Growing understanding of the biology and complexity of the HER2 signaling network and of potential resistance mechanisms has guided the development of new HER2-targeted agents. Combinations of these drugs to more completely inhibit the HER receptor layer, or combining HER2-targeted agents with agents that target downstream signaling, alternative pathways, or components of the host immune system, are being vigorously investigated in the preclinical and clinical settings.

The development of breast cancer involves a progression through intermediate stages until the invasive carcinoma and finally into metastatic disease. Given the variability in clinical progression, the identification of markers that could predict the tumor behavior is particularly important in breast cancer. The determination of tumor markers is a useful tool for clinical management in cancer patients, assisting in diagnostic, staging, evaluation of therapeutic response, detection of recurrence and metastasis, and development of new treatment modalities. In this context, this review aims to discuss the main tumor markers in breast carcinogenesis. The most well-established breast molecular markers with prognostic and/or therapeutic value like hormone receptors, HER-2 oncogene, Ki-67, and p53 proteins, and the genes for hereditary breast cancer will be presented. Furthermore, this review shows the new molecular targets in breast cancer: CXCR4, caveolin, miRNA, and FOXP3, as promising candidates for future development of effective and targeted therapies, also with lower toxicity.

HER2 (also known as NEU, EGFR2, or ERBB2) is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of certain human cancers, and mutations have recently been reported in lung cancers. We sequenced the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2 in 671 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 80 NSCLC cell lines, and 55 SCLCs and other neuroendocrine lung tumors as well as 85 other epithelial cancers (breast, bladder, prostate, and colorectal cancers) and compared the mutational status with clinicopathologic features and the presence of EGFR or KRAS mutations. HER2 mutations were present in 1.6% (11 of 671) of NSCLC and were absent in other types of cancers. Only one adenocarcinoma cell line (NCI-H1781) had a mutation. All HER2 mutations were in-frame insertions in exon 20 and target the identical corresponding region as did EGFR insertions. HER2 mutations were significantly more frequent in never smokers (3.2%, 8 of 248; P=0.02) and adenocarcinoma histology (2.8%, 11 of 394; P=0.003). In 394 adenocarcinoma cases, HER2 mutations preferentially targeted Oriental ethnicity (3.9%) compared with other ethnicities (0.7%), female gender (3.6%) compared with male gender (1.9%) and never smokers (4.1%) compared with smokers (1.4%). Mutations in EGFR, HER2, and KRAS genes were never present together in individual tumors and cell lines. The remarkable similarities of mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes involving tumor type and subtype, mutation type, gene location, and specific patient subpopulations targeted are unprecedented and suggest similar etiologic factors. EGFR, HER2, and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting different pathways to lung cancer in smokers and never smokers.",

In Cox models, AR expression (HR, 0.248; 95 % CI, 0.086-0.716) and lymph node status (HR, 6.401; 95 % CI, 1.428-28.686) were independent predictors for DFS in ER(+) cancers, whereas AR(+)/HER2(+) expression status (HR, 2.927; 95 % CI, 1.256-6.821) and lymph node status (HR, 2.690; 95 % CI, 1.041-7.840) were independent predictors for DFS in ER(-) cancers. We show that AR might be an additional marker for endocrine responsiveness in ER(+) cancers and suggests that blocking MTA1 might be an effective way to inhibit AR/HER2 signaling in ER(-) breast cancer.

ER and PR expression were both inversely associated with comedo histology and nuclear grade. HER-2/neu overexpression was positively associated with comedo histology, high nuclear grade, and periductal neovascularization and was inversely correlated with both ER and PR expression.

Recently, targeted therapies such as Trastuzumab treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer has been important. Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer is characterized by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR), and the absence of HER2 protein overexpression, and so there is no targeted therapy for this subtype. In this study, we examined the biological and prognostic characteristics in TN breast cancer.;Between January 1998 and September 2006, 1,552 patients with primary breast cancer were investigated retrospectively in this study and ER, PgR and HER2 status were evaluated in all cases. Furthermore, p53 overexpression and Ki67 values were examined immunohistochemically.;Patient distribution according to ER, PgR or HER2 status was as follows: ER and PgR positive: 57.9%, and ER and PgR negative: 25.1%. With regards to the HER2 status, HER2 positive was 23.3%, and triple negative (TN) was 14.0%. TN breast cancer has a high proliferation rate, high nuclear grade and frequent p53 overexpression. Patients with TN tumors had a significantly poorer disease-free survival (DFS) than those with non-TN tumors. After recurrence the overall survival (OS) rate in TN cases was significantly lower than that of the non-TN cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that TN was a significant factor for DFS and OS after recurrence.;TN breast cancer is a rare subtype with a high proliferation rate and a high nuclear grade, p53 overexpression, and lower DFS/OS.

Systemic inflammation following FA treatment is chronic, as shown by a doubling of the levels of the serum biomarker, haptoglobin, 15 days following initial treatment. We also show that this systemic inflammation is associated with the increased growth of hyperplastic mammary lesions.

Experiments explored the regulatory interactions between the HER2 and ER pathways and the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen.;Stable or transient or natural HER2 overexpression in ER-positive breast cancer cells promoted the nucleus-to-cytoplasm relocalization of ER, enhanced interactions of ER with HER2, inhibited ER transactivation function, and induced resistance to tamoxifen-mediated growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. In addition, HER2 up-regulation resulted in ER interaction with Sos, a component of Ras signaling, and hyperstimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Conversely, down-regulation of HER2 by the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody Herceptin led to suppression of ERK1/2 stimulation, restoration of ER to the nucleus, and potentiation of the growth-inhibitory action of tamoxifen.;The results presented here show for the first time that ER redistribution to the cytoplasm and its interaction with HER2 are important downstream effects of HER2 overexpression, that ERK1/2 is important for ER cytoplasmic localization, and that subcellular localization of ER may play a mechanistic role in determining the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen.",

Although these problems are partly alleviated by the use of validated, standardised 'kits', there may be considerable cost involved in their use. Prior to testing it may therefore be an advantage to be able to predict from basic pathology data whether a cancer is likely to overexpress HER2. In this study, we have correlated pathology features of cancers with the frequency of HER2 overexpression assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using HercepTest (Dako). In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) has been used to re-test the equivocal cancers and interobserver variation in assessing HER2 overexpression has been examined by a slide circulation scheme. Of the 1536 cancers, 1144 (74.5%) did not overexpress HER2. Unequivocal overexpression (3+ by IHC) was seen in 186 cancers (12%) and an equivocal result (2+ by IHC ) was seen in 206 cancers (13%). Of the 156 IHC 3+ cancers for which complete data was available, 149 (95.5%) were ductal NST and 152 (97%) were histological grade 2 or 3. Only 1 of 124 infiltrating lobular carcinomas (0.8%) showed HER2 overexpression. None of the 49 'special types' of carcinoma showed HER2 overexpression. Re-testing by FISH of a proportion of the IHC 2+ cancers showed that only 25 (23%) of those assessable exhibited HER2 gene amplification, but 46 of the 47 IHC 3+ cancers (98%) were confirmed as showing gene amplification. Circulating slides for the assessment of HER2 score showed a moderate level of agreement between pathologists (kappa 0.4). As a result of this study we would advocate consideration of a triage approach to HER2 testing. Infiltrating lobular and special types of carcinoma may not need to be routinely tested at presentation nor may grade 1 NST carcinomas in which only 1.4% have been shown to overexpress HER2. Testing of these carcinomas may be performed when HER2 status is required to assist in therapeutic or other clinical/prognostic decision-making. The highest yield of HER2 overexpressing carcinomas is seen in the grade 3 NST subgroup in which 24% are positive by IHC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast and ovarian cancers are the leading cause of death for women in many areas in the world including the United States. Overexpression of the HER-2/neu gene (also known as c-erbB2) is a frequent event in about 30% of breast as well as ovarian cancers. The overall survival rates of breast and ovarian cancer patients whose tumors overexpress HER-2/neu are significantly lower than those of patients whose tumors do not overexpress HER-2/neu. Overexpression of HER-2/neu leads to elevated tumorigenicity, enhanced metastatic potential, increased resistance to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and resistance to treatments such as paclitaxel and tamoxifen. Down-regulation of the HER-2/neu oncogene causes suppression of the cell-transforming phenotype induced by the oncogene. For example, downregulation of the HER-2/neu gene expression by E1A significantly mitigated tumorigenic activity of human breast and ovarian cancer cells in nude mice. These results strongly imply that HER-2/neu mediated cell transformation may be inhibited by transcriptional repressors that target the promoter of the oncogene. In addition to E1A, we recently identified the ets transcription factor PEA3 as a potential HER-2/neu gene inhibitor. PEA3 binds directly to this consensus binding motif and suppresses the HER-2/neu gene promoter activity. Downregulation of HER-2/neu expression led to inhibition of cell transformation and proliferation in vitro. In a preclinical gene therapy setting, in which the PEA3 gene tumor delivery was facilitated by a cationic liposome DC-Chol, blocked HER-2/neu overexpression by PEA3 resulted in prolonged survival of treated animals. These studies demonstrate a promising approach to cancer gene therapy using transcriptional repressors to target expression of oncogenes such as HER-2/neu.",

In order to quantify Her-2/neu expression, three criterias were applied that includes the pattern of staining, intensity of staining and percentage of tumor cells stained. Furthermore, its association was seen with various clinicopathological variables including age, gender, histopathological type, grade and stage of the tumor. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as significant.;From the total of 95 cases, 75 (78.9 %) cases showed Her-2/neu expression. Pattern of Her-2/neu staining was significantly associated with the grade of colorectal cancer depicting cytoplasmic Her-2/neu expression higher in low grade (50 %) while membranous Her-2/neu expression more in high grade colorectal cancer (45 %) (P-value = 0.030). Pattern of Her-2/neu staining was also significantly associated with the type of colorectal cancer representing membranous Her-2/neu expression to be more common in mucinous type (38.5 %) while cytoplasmic Her-2/neu expression to be more frequent in non mucinous type (42.7 %) of colorectal cancer (p-value = 0.024). We observed a significant association between percentage of cells stained & tumor type, with score 3+ maximum in non mucinous type of colorectal cancer (p-value = 0.006).;Her2/neu is considerably expressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma in Pakistani population. Our findings indicate a significant strong association of cytoplasmic Her-2/neu expression with low grades and membranous Her-2/neu expression with high grades of colorectal cancer. These findings add to the body of information & may help in conducting clinical trials in future to explore its therapeutic significance as well.",

In a subset of these cases, heterogeneous distribution of HER2 gene amplification can be found, which creates clinically challenging scenarios. Currently, breast cancers with HER2 amplification/overexpression in just over 10% of cancer cells are considered HER2-positive for clinical purposes; however, it is unclear as to whether the HER2-negative components of such tumors would be driven by distinct genetic alterations. Here we sought to characterize the pathologic and genetic features of the HER2-positive and HER2-negative components of breast cancers with heterogeneous HER2 gene amplification and to define the repertoire of potential driver genetic alterations in the HER2-negative components of these cases.;We separately analyzed the HER2-negative and HER2-positive components of 12 HER2 heterogeneous breast cancers using gene copy number profiling and massively parallel sequencing, and identified potential driver genetic alterations restricted to the HER2-negative cells in each case. In vitro experiments provided functional evidence to suggest that BRF2 and DSN1 overexpression/amplification, and the HER2 I767M mutation may be alterations that compensate for the lack of HER2 amplification in the HER2-negative components of HER2 heterogeneous breast cancers.;Our results indicate that even driver genetic alterations, such as HER2 gene amplification, can be heterogeneously distributed within a cancer, and that the HER2-negative components are likely driven by genetic alterations not present in the HER2-positive components, including BRF2 and DSN1 amplification and HER2 somatic mutations.",

We have recently discovered compound with anticancer activity, Curaxin-137, which modulates several important signaling pathways involved in even the very early stages of cancer. In tumor cells, Curaxin-137 inhibits NF-κB- and HSF1-dependent transcription (prosurvival pathways) and activates p53 (a proapoptotic pathway) without inducing DNA damage. These effects result from chromatin trapping and inhibition of activity of the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex by Curaxin-137. FACT has not been previously implicated in cancer, but we found that its subunits are overexpressed in breast cancer. On the basis of this background, we tested whether Curaxin-137 could suppress tumorigenesis in MMTV-neu transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop mammary carcinoma due to steroid receptor-regulated expression of the Her2 proto-oncogene. We found that chronic administration of Curaxin-137 in a preventive regimen to MMTV-neu mice did not cause any detectable changes in normal organs and tissues, yet inhibited tumor onset, delayed tumor progression, and prolonged survival of mice in a dose-dependent manner. Curaxin-137 induced changes in FACT, altered NF-κB localization, and activated p53 in tumor cells as expected from its defined mechanism of action. These results support further investigation of Curaxin-137 as a potential preventive and/or early-stage therapeutic agent for breast cancer.",

Our results demonstrated that HER2 overexpression increased the invasive potential of cells. Our results also showed that HER2 overexpression lead to the production of TGFβ resulting in the activation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling. Furthermore, activation of SNAIL, SLUG and ZEB-1, the transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin and increased mesenchymal characteristics were observed in high HER2 cells. Interestingly, EMT by HER2 was mediated through TGFβ. Intravenous injection of high HER2 MDA-MB-231 (HH) cells in athymic nude mice showed early and substantial metastasis as compared to the parent cells establishing the direct role of HER2 in metastasis. Our results showed that inhibition of HER2 mediated EMT by cucurbitacin B a triterpenoid, resulted in the suppression of brain metastasis of breast cancer cells.

Moreover, it has been suggested that the protective effects of olive oil against breast cancer may be due to some other components of the oil rather than to a direct effect of OA.;Using flow cytometry, western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, metabolic status (MTT), soft-agar colony formation, enzymatic in situ labeling of apoptosis-induced DNA double-strand breaks (TUNEL assay analyses), and caspase-3-dependent poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage assays, we characterized the effects of exogenous supplementation with OA on the expression of Her-2/neu oncogene, which plays an active role in breast cancer etiology and progression. In addition, we investigated the effects of OA on the efficacy of trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody binding with high affinity to the ectodomain of the Her-2/neu-coded p185(Her-2/neu) oncoprotein. To study these issues we used BT-474 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells, which naturally exhibit amplification of the Her-2/neu oncogene.;Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated a dramatic (up to 46%) reduction of cell surface-associated p185(Her-2/neu) following treatment of the Her-2/neu-overexpressors BT-474 and SK-Br3 with OA. Indeed, this effect was comparable to that found following exposure to optimal concentrations of trastuzumab (up to 48% reduction with 20 microg/ml trastuzumab). Remarkably, the concurrent exposure to OA and suboptimal concentrations of trastuzumab (5 microg/ml) synergistically down-regulated Her-2/neu expression, as determined by flow cytometry (up to 70% reduction), immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy studies. The nature of the cytotoxic interaction between OA and trastuzumab revealed a strong synergism, as assessed by MTT-based cell viability and anchorage-independent soft-agar colony formation assays. Moreover, OA co-exposure synergistically enhanced trastuzumab efficacy towards Her-2/neu overexpressors by promoting DNA fragmentation associated with apoptotic cell death, as confirmed by TUNEL and caspase-3-dependent PARP cleavage. In addition, treatment with OA and trastuzumab dramatically increased both the expression and the nuclear accumulation of p27(Kip1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor playing a key role in the onset and progression of Her-2/neu-related breast cancer. Finally, OA co-exposure significantly enhanced the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit signaling pathways downstream of Her-2/neu, including phosphoproteins such as AKT and MAPK.;These findings demonstrate that OA, the main monounsaturated fatty acid of olive oil, suppresses Her-2/neu overexpression, which, in turn, interacts synergistically with anti-Her-2/neu immunotherapy by promoting apoptotic cell death of breast cancer cells with Her-2/neu oncogene amplification. This previously unrecognized property of OA offers a novel molecular mechanism by which individual fatty acids may regulate the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells and therefore be helpful in the design of future epidemiological studies and, eventually, dietary counseling.",

There are currently no clear guidelines as to whether all of these foci should be tested for HER2 status. We reviewed the results of 172 patients in whom HER2 in situ hybridisation (ISH) testing was performed on at least two ipsilateral synchronous invasive carcinomas. Discordant results in different invasive foci were relatively uncommon and occurred in only eight (5%) of the 172 patients. This showed a statistically significant correlation with similarly discordant oestrogen receptor (ER) results. In addition HER2 discordance was more likely amongst different tumour foci if these arose in distinct and separate areas of DCIS.

In contrast, in patients with HER2 overexpression, the difference in survival between single HR+ tumors and double HR+ HR- tumors was not statistically significant. In patients without HER2 overexpression the DFS and OS of ER + PR- and ER-PR+ tumors were not significantly different from those of ER-PR- tumors.;We have identified clinically and biologically distinct features of single HR+ tumors (ER-PR+ and ER + PR-) through comparison with both ER + PR+ and ER-PR- tumors. These differences were only significant in HER2- tumors, not in HER2+ tumors. Single HR+ tumors without HER2 overexpression (ER + PR-HER2- or ER-PR + HER2-) were associated with poorer survival than ER + PR + HER2- tumors, and had comparable poor survival to ER-PR-HER2- tumors (triple-negative breast cancer).",

The role of this receptor in the progression of HER2+ breast cancer and resistance to certain anticancer monotherapies was investigated. The results of several pre-clinical and clinical trials, with the aim of determining the most safe and effective course of treatment for HER2+ breast cancer, were also thoroughly examined.;A thorough search of databases including Pubmed, Springer, and The American Society of Clinical Oncology was performed, and pertinent studies were identified. The most relevant studies were preclinical, phase II, and III clinical trials identifying the function of the HER2 receptor in HER2+ breast cancer progression, as well as studies assessing the efficacy of monotherapy and combination therapy in the treatment of this aggressive form of cancer.;The HER2 receptor belongs to a family of receptors that consists of four cell-surface receptors (HER1-4) that share strong homology with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). All HER receptors interact with specific types of ligands to induce receptor activation, except for HER2, for which no known ligand has yet been identified. HER2 is activated by forming dimers with other HER receptors, and this results in a stronger and more prolonged signal transduction event. When expressed at normal levels, HER2 regulates cell growth, differentiation, and survival. However, under pathological conditions of HER2 overexpression, numerous HER2 heterodimers are formed resulting in aggressive tumor growth. Therefore, the prognosis associated with HER2-positive breast cancer is usually poor. A specific cohort of patients with breast cancer whose tumors test both hormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) and HER2 positive have been found to be resistant to targeted hormone therapy. Studies investigating the etiology of this resistance have found that the cell membrane estrogen receptor communicates with HER2 in promoting the release of ER coactivators that cause the endocrine drug and selective estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen, to act as an agonist rather than an antagonist of the hormone estrogen. Thus, research has directed its inquiry toward the development of therapies specifically targeting HER2. The development of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, initially proved to be a well-tolerated first line of treatment. However, in the long-term patients, trastuzumab was shown to develop resistance to this monotherapy. Therefore, research on HER2 positive breast cancer has focused on the study of different anti-HER2 combination therapies over the past decade.;While the development and approval of the HER2-targeted recombinant monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been efficacious in slowing HER2 cancer progression, combining this and other anti-HER2 therapy with either chemotherapy or endocrine therapy has proven more effective in improving overall and progression free survival.",

In this study, we characterize a new anti-HER2/neu antibody resistant and metastatic mouse breast carcinoma cell line, TUBO-P2J. This cell line was developed during in vivo experiments using the antibody sensitive and non-metastatic tumor line TUBO. In addition, TUBO-P2J was used to establish an intratumoral HER2 heterogenous animal tumor model to evaluate the therapeutic effects of anti-HER2/neu antibody.;After establishing the cell line, TUBO-P2J was characterized regarding its susceptibility to anti-neu antibody and chemotherapeutics, as well as its metastatic potential in vitro and in vivo. In addition, expression profiles of metastasis related genes were also evaluated. A clinically relevant intratumoral HER2 heterogenous tumor model was established by inoculating mice with tumor cells consisting of TUBO and TUBO-P2J at a ratio of 1,000:1 or 10,000:1. Tumor growth and mouse survival were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of anti-neu antibody.;The TUBO-P2J cell line is a HER2/neu negative and highly metastatic variant of TUBO. This cell line was resistant to anti-neu antibody therapy, and when inoculated subcutaneously, metastasized to the lungs within 14 days. Compared to the parental TUBO cell line, TUBO-P2J displayed an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related gene expression profile including: the loss of E-cadherin, and increased Vimentin, Snail, and Twist1 expression. In addition, TUBO-P2J exhibited increased invasion and migration activity, and was resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Finally, mixed tumor implantations experiments revealed that an increased percentage of TUBO-P2J rendered tumors less responsive to anti-neu antibody therapy.;This study describes a novel model of intratumoral heterogenous metastatic breast cancer in immune competent mice that can be used to develop novel or combined immunotherapies to overcome antibody resistance.",

Silencing Beclin 1 decreased levels of HER2 and significantly promoted TAM sensitivity of MCF-7 and MCF-7R in vitro. Overexpression of HER2 could reverse TAM sensitivity, which was formerly increased in Beclin 1 downregulated cell. Beclin 1 level was not only positively correlated with level of HER2 but also negatively correlated with overall survival of ER-positive breast cancer patients. Using bioinformatic methods, Beclin 1 mRNA was found to be negatively correlated with overall survival in breast cancer patients receiving TAM treatment.

There were 131 AR positive, 205 AR negative cases and 143 HER-2 positive, 193 HER-2 negative cases. When subdividing into four groups according to AR and HER-2 status, there were 55 AR(+)/HER-2(-) cases, 76 AR(+)/HER-2(+) cases, 67 AR(-)/HER-2(+) cases and 138 AR(-)/HER-2(-) cases. GNMT and PIPOX expression was highest in the AR(+)/HER-2(-) group while expressed lowest in the AR(-)/HER-2(-) group (P<0.001). Stromal PIPOX expression was highest in the AR(-)/HER-2(+) group and lowest in the AR(-)/HER-2(-) group (P=0.010). GNMT and PIPOX expression was higher in the AR positive group compared with those of AR negative group (P=0.001, and P<0.001, respectively), while tumoral and stromal PIPOX expression showed a significant association with HER-2 positivity (P=0.006, and P=0.005, respectively). AR positive group had the highest ratio of low sarcosine type while the AR negative group had the highest ratio of null type (P<0.001). In conclusion, ER negative breast cancer showed different expression of sarcosine metabolism related proteins according to AR and HER-2 status. GNMT and PIPOX expression was high in the AR positive group while tumoral and stromal PIPOX expression was high in the HER-2 positive group. ",

The correlation between the expression level of Her-2 and clinical features was investigated. The positive expression rate of Her-2 in cancerous tissue detected using qPCR and IHC was 11.17% (46/412) and 13.38% (57/426), respectively. The positive expression of the Her-2 protein/gene was significantly correlated with the depth of invasion and lymphatic metastasis, as well as the TNM stage (P<0.05). No significant correlation was identified between positive expression of the Her-2 protein/gene and tumor location, age, gender, differentiation degree and Lauren classification (P>0.05).

Nevertheless, while trastuzumab is highly effective in many Her-2/neu overexpressing tumors, some do not respond. The reason for the differential effect is unknown, but it has been hypothesized that the complex interactions between Her-2/neu and other members of the EGFR family are involved in trastuzumab resistance. We have analyzed the protein expression of Her-2/neu, EGFR, and their activated forms, ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu, ptyr-845 EGFR and ptyr-1173 EGFR, in 57 Her-2/neu overexpressing breast tumors and investigated potential correlations between the receptors. By performing immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, we found that ptyr-845 EGFR was significantly co-expressed with Her-2/neu and ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu (p=0.043 and p=0.040, respectively), while ptyr-1173 EGFR was only correlated to Her-2/neu expression (p=0.042). Interestingly, EGFR and its activated forms were all significantly inversely correlated with PgR expression (p=0.011, p=0.033 and p=0.032, respectively), and ptyr-845 EGFR was also inversely correlated with ER expression (p=0.008). While we have previously shown that serum levels of the extracellular component of Her-2/neu are associated with tumoral ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu expression, we did not find a similar relationship between serum EGFR and intratumoral total/activated EGFR. We did, however, observe significantly higher levels of serum EGFR in women with 3+ overexpression of HER-2/neu (p=0.047). Taken together, we have demonstrated the activation pattern of EGFR and Her-2/neu in Her-2/neu overexpressing breast cancer. We suggest that EGFR inhibition might enhance the efficacy of trastuzumab by preventing cross-phosphorylation.",

The aim of this case-control study is to determine reproductive factors associated with breast cancer subtypes in Chinese women. A total of 1,417 patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China between 2001 and 2009 and 1,587 matched controls without a prior breast cancer were enrolled. Personal interviews were conducted to obtain information on reproductive characteristics and clinical history. Relationships between the factors and the subtypes of breast cancer were examined using logistic regression to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Notably, luminal A (50.0%) was the most prevalent subtype relative to luminal B (15.10%), HER2-overexpressing (10.87%) and triple-negative (23.08%). Menarche at an early age was associated with a reduced risk of luminal A (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.45-3.81). Breastfeeding protected parous women from any subtype of breast cancer. Postmenopause and spontaneous abortion were inversely associated with the risk of luminal tumors. By contrast, multiparity, family history of breast cancer and induced abortion increased the risk of breast cancer. Collectively, our findings suggest that reproductive factors such as age at menarche, parity, breastfeeding, menopausal status and abortion history have different effects on the subtypes of breast cancer in Chinese women.",

In the present study, we analyzed the usefulness of immunohistochemistry for separation of the distinct subtypes of the breast ductal carcinomas and provided further characterization of \"basal-like subtype\". A consecutive series of 195 primary operable invasive breast carcinomas was immunostained for HER2, ER, PGR, CK5/6 and CK17. CK5/6 or CK17 were expressed in 72 cases (36.9%), and 41 cases (21%) presented expression of CK5/6 or CK17 without ER/PGR or HER2. ER/PGR was present in 109 cases (55.9%), but in this group there were 8 cases with HER2 overexpression and 17 cases with basal-cytokeratin positivity. Similarly, in 17 out of 72 \"basal-like\" tumors there was ER/PGR positivity, and also in 17 of them there was HER2 overexpression. Three of these cases belonged to all three groups, representing expression of all markers. Tumor grade differed significantly (p < 0.001) between luminal and basal cytokeratin- or HER2-positive tumors. Differences for tumor size and lymph node status were not statistically significant.

The studies demonstrated that the most numerous myofibroblasts were present in G3 cases and they were the least frequent in G1 cases (P = 0.02).

A poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was diagnosed by pathological examination, and immunostaining results were as follows: CK7(+), CK20(-), mammaglobin (-), GCDFP-15 (-), ER (-), PgR (-), and HER2 (-). Because there was no original lesion other than the breast cancer, the tumor was diagnosed as a metastasis of breast cancer. The frequency of peritoneal metastasis of breast cancer is low.

Durable tumor control in the HER2+ SUM225 model was more effective with the combination treatment than either lapatinib or radiotherapy alone. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that radiosensitization by lapatinib correlated with ERK1/2 inhibition in the EGFR+ SUM149 model and with AKT inhibition in the HER2+ SUM225 model.;Our data suggest that lapatinib combined with fractionated radiotherapy may be useful against EGFR+ and HER2+ breast cancers and that inhibition of downstream signaling to ERK1/2 and AKT correlates with sensitization in EGFR+ and HER2+ cells, respectively.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Previous studies have demonstrated that androgen receptor is expressed in many breast cancers, but its expression in relation to the various breast cancer subtypes as defined by molecular profiling has not been studied in detail. We constructed tissue microarrays from 3093 breast cancers that developed in women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Tissue microarray sections were immunostained for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), cytokeratin 5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and androgen receptor (ER). Immunostain results were used to categorize each cancer as luminal A or B, HER2 and basal like. The relationships between androgen receptor expression and molecular subtype were analyzed. Overall, 77% of the invasive breast carcinomas were androgen receptor positive. Among 2171 invasive cancers, 64% were luminal A, 15% luminal B, 6% HER2 and 11% basal like. The frequency of androgen receptor expression varied significantly across the molecular phenotypes (P<0.0001). In particular, androgen receptor expression was commonly observed in luminal A (91%) and B (68%) cancers, but was less frequently seen in HER2 cancers (59%). Despite being defined by the absence of ER and PR expression and being considered hormonally unresponsive, 32% of basal-like cancers expressed androgen receptor. Among 246 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, 86% were androgen receptor positive, but the frequency of androgen receptor expression differed significantly across the molecular phenotypes (P=0.001), and high nuclear grade lesions were less likely to be androgen receptor positive compared with lower-grade lesions. Androgen receptor expression is most commonly seen in luminal A and B invasive breast cancers. However, expression of androgen receptor is also seen in approximately one-third of basal-like cancers, providing further evidence that basal-like cancers represent a heterogeneous group. Our findings raise the possibility that targeting the androgen receptor pathway may represent a novel therapeutic approach to the management of patients with basal-like cancers.",

The reports concerning the expression of c-erbB2/HER-2/neu in salivary gland tumours are few and controversial. Thus, eleven cases of SDC were evaluated for HER-2/neu status using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular genetic analysis of SDCs using FISH. HER-2/neu overexpression, identified as strong membrane staining, was observed in all but one case of SDC in majority of neoplastic cells while only four tumours, of nine cases analysed, revealed HER-2/neu gene amplification by means of FISH analysis. SDCs were associated with poor clinical outcome, 6 patients (55%) died of disseminated carcinoma within 4 to 44 months after therapy.

HER-2 expression was determined by routine clinical laboratory assessment, and tumors with 3 + immunohistochemistry staining intensity or gene amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization were considered HER-2 positive. Response was assessed by physical examination, imaging assessment, and pathologic assessment at the time of surgery.;The median patient age was 45 years. At baseline, 68% of patients had lymph node positive disease, 87% had >/= T2 tumors, and 28% of patients had HER-2 positive tumors. Eighty-four percent of patients received four courses of FAC, 8% of patients received 3 courses of FAC, and the remaining 8% of patients received 5-6 courses of FAC. The clinical response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) was 78%, the imaging response rate (CR and PR) was 64%, and 15% of patients had a good pathologic response, defined as a CR or minimal residual disease (tumor measuring < 1 cm in greatest dimension and negative lymph nodes). Concordance between the three methods of response assessment (clinical, pathologic, and imaging) was modest and was best between clinical assessment and imaging assessment (64% concordance).

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidemiological studies have suggested that the consumption of fruits and vegetables that provide several classes of compounds, including Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), may have chemopreventive activity against breast cancer. Several in vitro and in vivo animal studies also provide convincing evidence for the anti-tumor activity of I3C, however, the molecular mechanism(s) by which I3C exerts its biological effects on breast cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of I3C in Her-2/neu over-expressing MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells and compared these results with parental cells transfected with control vector. We focused our investigation in elucidating the molecular mechanism(s) by which I3C induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our data show that I3C inhibits breast cancer cell growth in a dose dependent manner in Her-2/neu over-expressing and in normal Her-2/neu expressing cells. Induction of apoptosis was also observed in these cell lines when treated with I3C, as measured by poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 activation. In addition, we found that I3C up-regulates Bax, down-regulates Bcl-2 and, thereby, increased the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 favoring apoptosis. These results suggest that the alteration in the expression of these genes may play an important role in mediating the biological effects of I3C. Moreover, we also show the cellular localization of Bax by confocal microscopy, which showed diffuse distribution of Bax throughout the cytoplasmic compartment in breast cancer cells in control culture. However, in I3C treated cells, Bax showed a punctate pattern of distribution that was localized in the mitochondria. From these results, we conclude that the over-expression and translocation of Bax to mitochondria causes mitochondrial depolarization and activation of caspases, which may be one of the mechanism(s) by which I3C induces apoptotic processes in I3C treated breast cancer cells. Overall, our present data provide a novel molecular mechanism(s) by which I3C elicits its biological effects on both Her-2/neu over-expressing and with normal Her-2/neu expressing breast cancer cells, suggesting that I3C could be an effective agent in inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells.",

To mimic the clinical situation we have established a series of MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines by long term treatment with the antiestrogens tamoxifen, ICI 164,384, and ICI 182,780. Common for these cell lines is a decreased expression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha). In human breast cancer, lack of response to endocrine therapy is often associated with decreased expression of the estrogen receptor and increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or HER-2/neu (ErbB-2). Our antiestrogen resistant cell lines did not express altered levels of EGFR, HER-2/neu, ErbB-3, or ErbB-4. Estrogen and antiestrogen regulation of HER-2/neu expression was essentially similar in parent and resistant MCF-7 cells. Treatment with antibodies to HER-2/neu (Herceptin) did not affect growth of MCF-7 cells or resistant cells, indicating that in this in vitro model system, acquired antiestrogen resistance does not emerge from activation of the HER-2/neu signaling pathway. In MCF-7 cells transfected with HER-2/neu and/or ErbB-3, overexpression alone did not result in resistance. However, addition of heregulinl-beta1 abolished the inhibitory activity of ICI 182,780 on both vector and HER-2/neu/ErbB-3 transfected MCF-7 cells, demonstrating that activation of the HER-2/neu receptor signaling pathway can override the growth inhibitory effect of ICI 182,780.",

We have characterized the role of miRNAs in regulating the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-pathway in breast cancer. We performed miRNA gain-of-function assays by screening two HER2 amplified cell lines (KPL-4 and JIMT-1) with a miRNA mimic library consisting of 810 human miRNAs. The levels of HER2, phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK1/2, cell proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (cPARP) were analyzed with reverse-phase protein arrays. Rank product analyses identified 38 miRNAs (q < 0.05) as inhibitors of HER2 signaling and cell growth, the most effective being miR-491-5p, miR-634, miR-637 and miR-342-5p. We also characterized miRNAs directly targeting HER2 and identified seven novel miRNAs (miR-552, miR-541, miR-193a-5p, miR-453, miR-134, miR-498, and miR-331-3p) as direct regulators of the HER2 3'UTR. We demonstrated the clinical relevance of the miRNAs and identified miR-342-5p and miR-744* as significantly down-regulated in HER2-positive breast tumors as compared to HER2-negative tumors from two cohorts of breast cancer patients (101 and 1302 cases). miR-342-5p specifically inhibited HER2-positive cell growth, as it had no effect on the growth of HER2-negative control cells in vitro. Furthermore, higher expression of miR-342-5p was associated with better survival in both breast cancer patient cohorts. In conclusion, we have identified miRNAs which are efficient negative regulators of the HER2 pathway that may play a role in vivo during breast cancer progression. These results give mechanistic insights in HER2 regulation which may open potential new strategies towards prevention and therapeutic inhibition of HER2-positive breast cancer. ",

Preclinical experiments indicate that increased expression of VEGF may in part mediate the biologically aggressive phenotype of HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer. It was the purpose of this study to: (a). evaluate the association between HER-2/neu and VEGF expression in a large clinical cohort of primary breast cancer patients; (b). compare the prognostic significance of VEGF isoforms; and (c). analyze the combined effects of HER-2/neu and VEGF on clinical outcome.;HER-2/neu and VEGF were measured by ELISA in primary breast tumor tissue lysates from 611 unselected patients with a median clinical follow-up of 50 months. At least six VEGF isoforms consisting of 121, 145, 165, 183, 189, or 206 amino acids are generated as a result of alternative splicing. The VEGF(121-206) ELISA uses antibodies that bind to VEGF(121) and, therefore, detects all of the VEGF isoforms with 121 and more amino acids. The VEGF(165-206) ELISA uses antibodies that bind to VEGF(165) and, therefore, detects all of the VEGF isoforms with 165 and more amino acids. VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206) were analyzed both as continuous and categorical variables, using detectable expression as a cutoff for positivity. Cell lines with defined HER-2/neu expression levels were used to establish a cutoff point for HER-2/neu overexpression in breast tumor samples.;Our findings indicate a significant positive association between HER-2/neu and VEGF expression. VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206) expression was detectable in 88 (77.2%) and 100 (87.7%), respectively, of the 114 patients with HER-2/neu-overexpressing tumors, in contrast to 271 (54.5%) and 353 (71.0%), respectively, of the 497 patients with nonoverexpressing tumors (chi(2) test: P < 0.001 for both VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206)). VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206) demonstrate a comparable prognostic significance for survival in unselected primary breast cancer patients (univariate analysis: VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0068; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.0046; multivariate analysis: VEGF(121-206), P = 0.1475; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.1483). When the analyses were performed separately for node-negative and node-positive patients, VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206) were of prognostic significance for survival only in node-positive patients (univariate analysis: VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0003; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.0038; multivariate analysis: VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0103; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.0150). A biological concentration-effect relationship between VEGF expression and survival (VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0280; VEGF(165-206,) P = 0.0097) suggests that VEGF levels, as determined by ELISA, could be of importance as a predictive marker for therapeutic strategies that target VEGF.

Molecular subtypes were classified into luminal A, luminal B, Her-2/neu-expressing and triple-negative. Clinicopathological and histological features of molecular subtypes were analyzed. Luminal A subtype was the most prevalent (41.2%), followed by triple-negative subtype (28.5%), then Her2-expressing subtype (19.4%) and luminal B subtype (13.9%). The commonest histological type was infiltrating duct carcinoma (83.2%), followed by infiltrating lobular carcinoma (9.1%) and medullary carcinoma (3.2%). The luminal A subtype was significantly correlated to low tumor grade, lower number of positive lymph nodes metastasis, absence of both necrosis and syncytial growth pattern. We concluded that the commonest molecular subtype of invasive breast carcinoma among Egyptian women is luminal subtype A, which displayed favorable features. Triple-negative subtype and medullary carcinomas are present in a ratio higher than in western countries.",

In this context, re-evaluation of HER2 status by assessment of HER2 expression on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a strategy with potential clinical application. The aim of this trial was to determine the HER2 status of CTCs in metastatic breast cancer patients comparing two CTC assays. A total of 254 patients with metastatic breast cancer from nine German university breast cancer centers were enrolled in this prospective study. HER2 status of CTCs was assessed using both the FDA-approved CellSearch® assay and AdnaTest BreastCancer™. Using the CellSearch assay, 122 of 245 (50%) patients had ≥5 CTCs, and HER2-positive CTCs were observed in 50 (41%) of these patients. Ninety of 229 (39%) patients were CTC positive using AdnaTest BreastCancer, and HER2 positivity rate was 47% (42 of 90). The rate of breast cancer patients with HER2-negative primary tumors but HER2-positive CTCs was 32% (25 of 78) and 49% (28 of 57) using the CellSearch assay and AdnaTest BreastCancer, respectively. Considering only those patients who had CTCs on both tests (n = 62), concordant results regarding HER2 positivity were obtained in 50% of the patients (31/62) (P = 0.96, κ = -0.006). HER2-positive CTCs can be detected in a relevant number of patients with HER2 negative primary tumors. Therefore, it will be mandatory to correlate the assay-dependent HER2 status of CTCs to the clinical response on HER2-targeted therapies.",

The triple negative breast carcinoma subtype (ER-/PR-/HER2-) has been associated with worse overall prognosis in comparison with other subtypes in study populations consisting of ethnic minorities and young women. We evaluated the prognostic value of breast cancer subtypes, Ki-67 proliferation index (Ki-67PI), and pathologic tumor characteristics on breast cancer survival in Caucasian women in our institution, where greater than 90% of the total patient population is white. From 628 new invasive breast cancer cases in our data base (2000-late 2004), 593 (94%) were identified in Caucasian women. ER/PR/HER2 breast cancer subtypes were classified based on St. Gallen International Expert Consensus recommendations from 2011. ER/PR/HER2 status and its effect on survival were analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier curve. ER/PR/HER2 status, grade, tumor-node-metastasis status (TNM)/anatomic stage, and age were analyzed in terms of survival in a multivariate fashion using a Cox regression. Ki-67PI was analyzed between ER/PR/HER2 groups using the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and 2 × 5 ANOVA. Our results showed that patients with stage IIB through stage IV breast carcinomas were 2.1-16 times more likely to die than patients with stages IA-B and IIA disease, respectively (95% CI 1.17-3.81 through 9.68-28.03, respectively), irrespective of ER/PR/HER2 subtype. Similar effect was seen with T2, N2/N3, or M1 tumors in comparison with T1, N0/N1, and M0 tumors. Chances of dying increase approximately 5% for every year increase in age. There was a significant main effect of Ki-67PI between ER/PR/HER2 subtypes, p < .001, but Ki-67PI could not predict survival. In summary, TNM status/anatomic stage of breast carcinomas and age are predictive of survival in our patient population of Caucasian women, but breast carcinoma subtypes and Ki-67 proliferation index are not.",

Due to the low incidence, there are no randomized clinical studies giving information on the optimal diagnostics and therapy for male breast cancer patients. Therefore, treatment recommendations are derived from established guidelines for breast cancer in women. However, the lack of awareness of this disease leads to its detection at a later stage in men associated with a worse prognostic outcome. The gender-specific differences in breast cancer are among others related to the differing genetic and hormonal environment and the anatomic constitution in men. For example, males have a much higher percentage of hormone receptor-positive tumors but a significantly lower fraction of carcinomas overexpressing HER2. This review focuses on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical findings of male breast cancer, and discusses current findings available to treat this disease.

Differential gene expression and distinct responses to a small molecule in BT474 (HER2+ trastuzumab-sensitive) and the PTEN-deficient trastuzumab-resistant derivative (BT474-PTEN-LTT) provided the selection tools to identify targets during EMT. siRNA knockdown and small molecule inhibition confirmed MEOX1 as one of the critical molecular targets to regulate both BCSCs and mesenchymal-like cell proliferation. MEOX1 was associated with poor survival, lymph node metastasis, and stage of breast cancer patients.

A probability sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was performed to characterize uncertainties in the expected outcomes, which are expressed as an incremental costs effectiveness ratio (ICER, cost/QALY). A willingness-to-pay threshold of 3-times the per capita gross domestic product was adopted according to the WHO definition. The Taiwan per capita gross domestic product in 2015 was US$22,355; thus, a threshold was considered as NT$2,011,950 (US$67 065, 1USD =30 NTD in 2015).;The model showed that adjuvant trastuzumab treatment in HER-2/neu positive early breast cancer yielded 1.631 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) compared with no trastuzumab treatment. The ICER was US $51,863 per QALY gained in the base-case scenario. The Monte Carlo simulation by varying all variables simultaneously demonstrated that the probability of cost-effectiveness at the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$67,065 was 50% for 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab.;From this real-world study, 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab treatment is likely to be a cost-effective therapy for patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 3-times GDP per capita in Taiwan.",

Although trastuzumab is approved for treatment of advanced breast cancer, a number of concerns exist with passive immunotherapy. Treatment is expensive and has a limited duration of action, necessitating repeated administrations of the mAb. Active immunotherapy with conformational B cell epitopes affords the possibility of generating an enduring immune response, eliciting protein-reactive high-affinity anti-peptide Abs. The three-dimensional structure of human HER-2 in complex with trastuzumab reveals that the Ag-binding region of HER-2 spans residues 563-626 that comprises an extensive disulfide-bonding pattern. To delineate the binding region of HER-2, we have designed four synthetic peptides with different levels of conformational flexibility. Chimeric peptides incorporating the measles virus fusion \"promiscuous\" T cell epitope via a four-residue linker sequence were synthesized, purified, and characterized. All conformational peptides were recognized by trastuzumab and prevented the function of trastuzumab inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, with 563-598 and 597-626 showing greater reactivity. All epitopes were immunogenic in FVB/N mice with Abs against 597-626 and 613-626 recognizing HER-2. The 597-626 epitope was immunogenic in outbred rabbits eliciting Abs which recognized HER-2, competed with trastuzumab for the same epitope, inhibited proliferation of HER-2-expressing breast cancer cells in vitro and caused their Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, immunization with the 597-626 epitope significantly reduced tumor burden in transgenic BALB-neuT mice. These results suggest the peptide B cell immunogen is appropriate as a vaccine for HER-2-overexpressing cancers because the resulting Abs show analogous biological properties to trastuzumab.",

While various autophagy inhibition strategies are under investigation for cancer treatment, corresponding patient selection criteria for these autophagy inhibitors need to be developed. Due to its central roles in the autophagy process, the cysteine protease ATG4B is one of the autophagy proteins being pursued as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we investigated the expression of ATG4B in breast cancer, a heterogeneous disease comprised of several molecular subtypes. We examined a panel of breast cancer cell lines, xenograft tumors, and breast cancer patient specimens for the protein expression of ATG4B, and found a positive association between HER2 and ATG4B protein expression. We showed that HER2-positive cells, but not HER2-negative breast cancer cells, require ATG4B to survive under stress. In HER2-positive cells, cytoprotective autophagy was dependent on ATG4B under both starvation and HER2 inhibition conditions. Combined knockdown of ATG4B and HER2 by siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability, and the combination of ATG4B knockdown with trastuzumab resulted in a greater reduction in cell viability compared to trastuzumab treatment alone, in both trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. Together these results demonstrate a novel association of ATG4B positive expression with HER2 positive breast cancers and indicate that this subtype is suitable for emerging ATG4B inhibition strategies.",

Wild-type p53 is crucial in regulating cell growth and apoptosis and is found to be mutated or deleted in 60-70% of human cancers. And some cancers with a wild-type p53 do not have normal p53 function, suggesting that it is implicated in a complex process regulated by many factors. In the present study, we showed that the overexpression of HER-2/neu could decrease the amount of wild-type p53 protein via activating PI3K pathway, as well as inducing MDM2 nuclear translocation in MCF7 human breast cancer cells. Blockage of PI3K pathway with its specific inhibitor LY294002 caused G1-S phase arrest, decreased cell growth rate and increased chemo- and radio-therapeutic sensitivity in MCF7 cells expressing wild-type p53. However, it did not increase the sensitivity to adriamycin in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells containing mutant p53. Our study indicates that blocking PI3K pathway activation mediated by HER-2/neu overexpression may be useful in the treatment of breast tumors with HER-2/neu overexpression and wild-type p53.",

In October 2013, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) issued joint updated guideline recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer, with a revised algorithm for interpretation of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridisation (ISH) results. This study investigates the impact on HER2 IHC categorisation, implication for reflex ISH testing and potential for identification of false negative IHC. HER2 IHC preparations on 251 invasive breast tumours, originally reported according to 2007 guidelines, were re-scored using 2013 guidelines and the diagnostic categories compared. The results of ISH testing on a separate cohort of 32 breast tumours reported as HER2 IHC 2+ following the introduction of the 2013 guidelines, that would have been designated 1+ according to 2007, were reviewed. Application of 2013 guidelines resulted in a decrease in tumours classified as HER2 negative (83/251 vs 144/251) and a comparable increase in those classified as equivocal (2+) (139/251 vs 80/251). Relatively few tumours were re-classified as positive (29/251 vs 27/251). Furthermore, 3/32 breast cancer cases (HER2 IHC 2+ as per 2013 guidelines, 1+ using 2007 guidelines) were HER2 ISH positive. Application of the 2013 guidelines increases the HER2 IHC equivocal (2+) category and requirement for reflex ISH testing. The reduced threshold for ISH testing identifies some patients with HER2 positive breast cancer whose tumours would have been categorised as HER2 negative according to the 2007 guidelines. ",

On examination, a firm non-tender mass measuring 2×2 cm was noted in the right upper outer quadrant. It was not attached to the underlying structures. Mammography revealed a dense irregular mass in the axillary tail and a circumscribed nodule in the 6 O'clock periareolar region. This was a new development compared to the patient's most recent screening mammogram performed 2 years and 6 months previously. Ultrasound demonstrated a lobulated solid mass in the axillary tail and a simple cyst in the 6 O'clock periareolar region. Biopsy of the areolar region of the right breast revealed atypical duct hyperplasia. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the right breast axillary tail revealed a poorly differentiated invasive carcinoma consistent with mammary duct origin. On histopathological examination, it was an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with metaplastic features of chondroid differentiation. The tumor was estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 negative with 0% nuclear staining. Ki-67 index was 52% with strong nuclear staining. The overall ELSTON grade of invasive carcinoma was grade 3. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with AC-T (adriamycin, cytoxan, and taxol) and is currently undergoing surveillance for recurrent disease.;Metaplastic breast cancer is an extremely rare subtype of breast carcinoma. Initial management of localized disease consists of wide excision with clear surgical margins followed by radiation or mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Although standard breast chemotherapy regimens such as AC-T are routinely used in metaplastic breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings, outcomes are significantly inferior to other breast subtypes.

In light of the consequences of HER2 status on treatment selection, further research is warranted to refine and standardize HER2 testing in order to minimize false-negative results and optimize selection of treatment pathways.

Both apocrine carcinomas were immunohistochemically negative for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR), but diffusely positive for androgen receptor (AR), GCDFP-15, and HER2. The presence of intraductal components in bilateral carcinomas and the absence of lymph node metastasis suggested that they were more likely to be individual primary lesions rather than metastatic disease. The spindle cell lesion showed a relatively well-circumscribed nodule contiguous with the apocrine carcinoma. HER2 oncoprotein overexpression was observed not only in the apocrine carcinoma, but also in the spindle cell lesion. Since the spindle cell component was intimately admixed with apocrine carcinoma and had focal cytokeratin expression, we diagnosed it as metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma, which was originated from the apocrine carcinoma.

We have therefore investigated the differential expression of EGFR, HER2, and their tyrosine-kinase activated forms (ptyr-1248 Her-2 and ptyr-845 EGFR) in 63 tumor specimen containing: a) malignant epithelium, b) in non-malignant tissue located at the peritumoral margin, and c) in uninvolved breast tissue obtained from tissue distant from the tumor. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we found significantly higher HER2 protein expression levels in malignant epithelium than in marginal and peripheral non-malignant epithelium (p=1.3 x 10(-10) Fisher's exact test). Epithelial EGFR expression did not differ between the three tissue types, but stromal EGFR protein was significantly more common in marginal and peripheral tissues when compared to tumor tissues (p=0.008, Fisher's exact test). When analyzing activated receptor forms, we found epithelial ptyr-1248 HER2 expression in one tumoral, one marginal and one peripheral sample. We did not observe ptyr-845 EGFR in any of the samples analyzed.

The relationship between immunohistochemical Bcl-2 expression and overall survival was analyzed in 2399 primary invasive breast cancer patients treated by curative surgery.

However, the pathological processes underlying this relationship have not been elucidated. We investigated the effect of young age on IBTR in a Korean cohort of women with different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We analyzed data of 2,102 consecutive breast cancer patients who underwent BCS and post-surgical radiation therapy (RT) at two Korean institutions between 2000 and 2005. Patients were classified as young (≤ 40 years; N = 513) or old (> 40 years; N = 1,589). Breast cancer subtype was determined by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. Median follow-up duration was 61 months. The 5-year IBTR rate was 3.4% in young patients and 1.1% in old patients (P < 0.001). Univariate analysis indicated that IBTR rate in young patients with luminal A and HER2 subtypes was significantly greater than in old patients with these subtypes (P = 0.015 and P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis, which used luminal A subtype in old patients as reference, indicated that HER2 subtype in young patients was associated with increased risk of IBTR (hazard ratio, HR = 12.24; 95% CI: 2.54-57.96). Among old patients, HER2 subtype was not associated with increased IBTR. In conclusion, young women had a higher rate of IBTR after BCS and RT than old women. This difference is mainly among women with HER2 subtype. Aggressive local control and adjuvant therapy should be considered for young women with HER2 subtype breast cancer.",

P-cadherin expression is restricted to the myoepithelial cells in normal breast tissue, and aberrant staining has also been described in invasive tumors. Several small studies have reported P-cadherin as a marker of poor outcome in breast cancer patients but its prognostic significance in relation to other variables has not been established in a large series of breast cancers. A tissue microarray was constructed from 3992 cases of invasive breast carcinoma, and P-cadherin expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Median follow-up was 12.5 years. The immunohistochemistry-based definitions of cancer subtypes were luminal (ER+ or PR+/HER2-), luminal/HER2+ (ER+ or PR+/HER2+), HER2+ (ER-/PR-/HER2+), and basal (ER-/PR-/HER2-/CK5/6+ or EGFR+). Clinical covariate and biomarker associations were assessed using contingency tables, and Pearson's χ(2) or Fisher's exact test. Survival associations were assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots, logrank and Breslow tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. P-cadherin was expressed in 34.8% (1290/3710, 50% cut point) of cases. P-cadherin staining was strongly associated with HER2+ and basal carcinoma subtypes (P<0.0005). P-cadherin-positive patients showed significantly poorer short-term (0-10 years) overall survival, disease-specific survival, distant relapse-free interval, and locoregional relapse-free interval in univariable models (P<0.05). In multivariable Cox models containing standard clinical covariates and cancer subtypes, P-cadherin did not show independent prognostic value. P-cadherin expression was positively associated with histological grade, chemotherapy, Ki-67, EGFR, CK5/6, p53, YB-1, and HER2 expression (P<0.002), and negatively associated with age at diagnosis, ER, PR, and Bcl-2 expression (P<0.0005). This study shows the value of P-cadherin as a marker of poor prognosis. The large sample size of this series clarifies contradictory findings of many smaller studies. P-cadherin positivity is associated with high-grade tumor subtypes and well-established markers of poor prognosis, and may represent a promising antibody therapeutic target.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Normal human breast tissue consists of epithelial and nonepithelial cells with different molecular profiles and differentiation grades. This molecular heterogeneity is known to yield abnormal clones that may contribute to the development of breast carcinomas. Stem cells that are found in developing and mature breast tissue are either positive or negative for cytokeratin 19 depending on their subtype. These cells are able to generate carcinogenesis along with mature cells. However, scientific data remains controversial regarding the monoclonal or polyclonal origin of breast carcinomas. The majority of breast carcinomas originate from epithelial cells that normally express BRCA1. The consecutive loss of the BRCA1 gene leads to various abnormalities in epithelial cells. Normal breast epithelial cells also express hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α and HIF-2α that are associated with a high metastatic rate and a poor prognosis for malignant lesions. The nuclear expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in normal human breast tissue is maintained in malignant tissue as well. Several controversies regarding the ability of ER and PR status to predict breast cancer outcome remain. Both ER and PR act as modulators of cell activity in normal human breast tissue. Ki-67 positivity is strongly correlated with tumor grade although its specific role in applied therapy requires further studies. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) oncoprotein is less expressed in normal human breast specimens but is highly expressed in certain malignant lesions of the breast. Unlike HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor expression is similar in both normal and malignant tissues. Molecular heterogeneity is not only found in breast carcinomas but also in normal breast tissue. Therefore, the molecular mapping of normal human breast tissue might represent a key research area to fully elucidate the mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The carcinogenic process is characterized, in part, by the dysfunction of cellular communication pathways, such as the one involving HER2. HER2 is a member of the EGF receptor family, which participates in cell growth and proliferation. HER2 may be overexpressed in 15 to 30% of breast cancer cases and is associated with poor prognosis, shortened overall survival and shorter time to disease progression. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the relevance of HER2 serum concentrations (sHER2, extracellular domain released into the blood by proteolysis) as a predictive marker of resistance to chemotherapy in HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. The determination of HER2 overexpression/ amplification in the diagnosis of relapse of breast cancer is currently a routine procedure. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, used to detect HER2 expression in the tumor, are improving constantly and other parallel techniques such as chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) are emerging. sHER2 concentrations can be measured using ELISA techniques, which can be automated. All of these procedures still need to be standardized. The discovery of a monoclonal antibody (4D5) that can inhibit the growth and proliferation of cells overexpressing HER2 led to the development of trastuzumab. Like 4D5, trastuzumab recognizes an epitope on the extracellular domain of HER2. Moreover, trastuzumab is also able to stimulate antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC). It is administered alone or in combination (with navelbine, taxol, carboplatin, etc.) in patients with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2. Other active antibodies have since been discovered, as well as other specific molecules, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors which will undoubtedly find a place in the therapeutic arsenal used in breast cancer, especially to avoid resistance to treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) amplification/overexpression (HER2+) frequently co-occurs with PI3K pathway activation in breast tumors. PI3K signaling is most often activated by PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss, which frequently results in sensitivity to p110α or p110β inhibitors, respectively. To examine the p110 isoform dependence in HER2+, PTEN-deficient tumors, we generated genetic mouse models of breast tumors driven by concurrent Her2 activation and Pten loss coupled with deletion of p110α or p110β. Ablation of p110α, but not p110β, significantly impaired the development of Her2+/Pten-null tumors in mice. We further show that p110α primarily mediates oncogenic signaling in HER2+/PTEN-deficient human cancers while p110β conditionally mediates PI3K/AKT signaling only upon HER2 inhibition. Combined HER2 and p110α inhibition effectively reduced PI3K/AKT signaling and growth of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Addition of the p110β inhibitor to dual HER2 and p110α inhibition induced tumor regression in a xenograft model of HER2+/PTEN-deficient human cancers. Together, our data suggest that combined inhibition of HER2 and p110α/β may serve as a potent and durable therapeutic regimen for the treatment of HER2+, PTEN-deficient breast tumors. ",

The neoplasms included pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; n = 59) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC; n = 649). The latter were all node negative and stratified into IDC combined (n = 237) or not combined (n = 412) with a \"significant amount\" of DCIS (defined as DCIS greater than or equal to 10% of total tumor cellularity). Overexpression of HER-2/neu was not observed in any of the hyperplastic or dysplastic lesions. In contrast, it was present in 56% of pure DCIS and in 77% of the comedo subtype of this group. Only 15% of IDC overexpressed HER-2/neu. However, the rate of overexpression was significantly higher in the subset of IDC combined with DCIS compared with the subset of IDC not combined with DCIS (22% v 11%, respectively; P less than .0001). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HER-2/neu plays a more important role in initiation than in progression of ductal carcinomas. They also suggest that overexpression decreases within individual tumors as they evolve from in situ to increasingly invasive lesions or, alternatively, that many invasive carcinomas arise de novo (ie, without progressing through a significant in situ stage) by mechanisms not involving HER-2/neu. In addition, overexpression of HER-2/neu was associated with several poor prognostic features (younger patient age, premenopause, negative estrogen receptor status, negative progesterone receptor status, and high nuclear grade) in the subset of IDC combined with DCIS. With one exception (negative estrogen receptor status) these associations were lost in IDC not combined with DCIS, also suggesting that the role of HER-2/neu changes during the progression of human breast cancer.",

We showed that trastuzumab treatment and its acquired resistance induced HER4 upregulation, cleavage and nuclear translocation. However, knockdown of HER4 by specific siRNAs increased trastuzumab sensitivity and reversed its resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Preventing HER4 cleavage by a γ-secretase inhibitor and inhibiting HER4 tyrosine kinase activity by neratinib decreased trastuzumab-induced HER4 nuclear translocation and enhanced trastuzumab response. There was also increased nuclear HER4 staining in the tumours from BT474 xenograft mice and human patients treated with trastuzumab. Furthermore, nuclear HER4 predicted poor clinical response to trastuzumab monotherapy in patients undergoing a window study and was shown to be an independent poor prognostic factor in HER2 positive breast cancer. Our data suggest that HER4 plays a key role in relation to trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Therefore, our study provides novel findings that HER4 activation, cleavage and nuclear translocation influence trastuzumab sensitivity and resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.

In this study we focused instead on identifying gene expression differences between breast tumors and adjacent normal tissue, and between different subtypes of tumor classified by clinical marker status. We have collected a set of 20 breast cancer tissues, matched with the adjacent pathologically normal tissue from the same patient. The cancer samples representing each subtype of breast cancer identified by estrogen receptor ER(+/-) and Her2(+/-) status and divided into four subgroups (ER+/Her2+, ER+/Her2-, ER-/Her2+, and ER-/Her2-) were hybridized on Affymetrix HG-133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. By comparing cancer samples with their matched normal controls we have identified 3537 overall differentially expressed genes using data analysis methods from Bioconductor. When we looked at the genes in common of the four subgroups, we found 151 regulated genes, some of them encoding known targets for breast cancer treatment. Unique genes in the four subgroups instead suggested gene regulation dependent on the ER/Her2 markers selection. In conclusion, the results indicate that microarray studies using robust analysis of matched tumor and normal samples from the same patients can be used to identify genes differentially expressed in breast cancer tumor subtypes even when small numbers of samples are considered and can further elucidate molecular features of breast cancer.",

We focused on the gene amplification and protein expression of ABCC3 (also known as MRP3) in breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumor samples. Fluorescence and chromogenic in situ hybridization, using an ABCC3-specific probe, was used to analyze 11 breast cancer cell lines and 112 clinical tumor samples. The results of ABCC3 were correlated with the amplification status of HER2 and topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), which are located close to ABCC3 at 17q12-q21. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess ABCC3 protein overexpression. Of the cell lines studied 6 HER2-positive lines and 1 HER2-negative line exhibited amplification of ABCC3. In the HER-2-negative clinical tumor samples, only 4/55 (7.3%) exhibited ABCC3 amplification. In the HER2-positive tumors, ABCC3 was amplified in 16/57 tumors (28.1%, P=0.0059). TOP2A did not exhibit any consistent coamplification pattern. ABCC3 (MRP3) protein overexpression was more common in tumors with gene amplification (P=0.069). In silico analysis of 804 breast cancers with matched gene expression and copy number microarray data revealed significant differences ABCC3 across the molecular subtypes. Specifically, increased ABCC3 mRNA and gene copy numbers were most prominent in HER2 amplified and/or HER2-enriched classified tumors. Moreover, differential ABCC3 mRNA levels were found within the HER-2 amplified subset when stratified by the estrogen receptor status. We conclude that ABCC3 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in HER2-positive breast cancer, and something that warrants further studies correlating the results with therapeutic outcome.",

This study is undertaken to compare rabbit monoclonal antibodies (RabMAb) for ER, PR, and HER2 against FDA-approved monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (FDAMpab). Cell blocks from primary and metastatic/recurrent breast carcinomas of 52 breast cancer patients were used. Immunohistochemistry was performed, following optimized epitope retrieval, with a polymer based detection system using RabMAb: ER (SP1), PR (SP2), and HER2 (SP3). FDA approved Mpab (Dako) used were: ER (1D5); PR (PgR636); and HercepTest kit according to manufacturer's instructions. HER2 immunostain is correlated with FISH results. Overall, positive, and negative agreement is as follows: 88.5, 88.9, and 88.2% for ER; 84.6, 70.5, and 91.4% for PR; 58.3, 100, and 50% for HER2. There is substantial to moderate agreement between RabMAb and FDAMpab for ER (kappa = 0.75) and PR (kappa = 0.64), respectively. There is poor agreement (kappa = 0.25) between RabMAb (SP3) and FDApab (HercepTest). SP3 shows better concordance (93.8%) than HercepTest (46.9%) with FISH results. RabMAb SP clones are almost comparable with FDA-approved ER and PR, with fair to moderate agreement. Both are as sensitive as their FDA-approved clones. SP3, on the other hand, is superior to HercepTest for detecting HER2 overexpression, with an excellent concordance with FISH.",

The purpose of this study was to explore if the expression of FOXA1 and GATA-3 may provide an opportunity to stratify subsets of patients that could have better outcome, among the ERalpha-negative/poor prognosis breast cancer group.;We evaluate FOXA1 and GATA-3 expression in 249 breast carcinomas by immunohistochemistry, associating it with breast cancer molecular markers, clinicopathological features and patient's survival. The clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical markers of the tumours were compared using the chi-square test and ANOVA. Disease-free survival was analysed through Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression.;FOXA1 expression was demonstrated in 42% of invasive carcinomas, while GATA-3 was detected in 48% of the cases. FOXA1 expression was inversely associated with tumour size, Nottingham Prognostic Index, histological grade, lymph vascular invasion, lymph node stage and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) overexpression, while GATA-3 expression showed inverse association with histological grade and HER-2. Both FOXA1 and GATA-3 were directly associated with ERalpha and progesterone receptor. Among FOXA1-positive tumours, 83.1% are comprised in the luminal A subtype, similar to GATA-3 where 87.7% of positive tumours were classified within this molecular subtype. In the subset of ERalpha-negative patients, those who were FOXA1-negative had a 3.61-fold increased risk of breast cancer recurrence when compared with the FOXA1-positive.;FOXA1 was a significant predictor of good outcome in breast cancer, whereas GATA-3 was an important luminal marker.

According to hormone receptor status and gene expression profiling, breast cancers are classified into four molecular subtypes, each showing distinct clinical behavior. Lack of sufficient data on molecular subtypes of breast cancer in Iran, prompted us to investigate the prevalence and the clinicopathological features of each subtype among Iranian women. A total of 428 women diagnosed with breast cancer from 2002 to 2011 were included and categorized into four molecular subtypes using immunohistochemistry. Prevalence of each subtype and its association with patients' demographics and tumor characteristics, such as size, grade, lymph-node involvement and vascular invasion, were investigated using Chi-square, analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression. Luminal A was the most common molecular subtype (63.8%) followed by Luminal B (8.4%), basal-like (15.9%) and HER-2 (11.9%). Basal-like and HER-2 subtypes were mostly of higher grades while luminal A tumors were more of grade 1 (P<0.001). Vascular invasion was more prevalent in HER-2 subtype, and HER-2 positive tumors were significantly associated with vascular invasion (P=0.013). Using muti-variate analysis, tumor size greater than 5 cm and vascular invasion were significant predictors of 3 or more nodal metastases. Breast cancer was most commonly diagnosed in women around 50 years of age and the majority of patients had lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis. This points to the necessity for devising an efficient screening program for breast cancer in Iran. Further, prospective surveys are suggested to evaluate prognosis of different subtypes in Iranian patients.",

Cell line studies suggest that many breast cancer cell lines are very resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, recent data suggest that a subset of triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer cells is sensitive to TRAIL as a single agent. In addition, many studies have demonstrated that resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells can be overcome by combinations of TRAIL with chemotherapy, radiation, and various targeted agents. This chapter will discuss the current understanding of the mechanisms, which control TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

We present here the most recent findings about the role and biology of sHER2 based on data obtained using a standardized test, which has been cleared by FDA in 2000, for measuring sHER2. This test includes quality control assessments and has been already widely used to evaluate the clinical utility of sHER2 as a biomarker in breast cancer.

The aim of our study was to identify antigens eliciting a humoral immune response in HER2+ and HER2- NP breast cancers by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D), Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. Sera from 18 women with newly diagnosed NP breast cancer (9 HER2+ and 9 HER2-) and 9 healthy volunteers were individually investigated for the presence of antibodies to MCF7 breast cancer cell line proteome. Reactive spots in 2D blots were matched to stained 2D gels. Twenty-eight of matched spots were identified by mass spectrometry.

The five former antigens were more commonly reacted with sera from HER2+ cases, and the three latter antigens were more commonly reacted with sera from HER2- cases. Noteworthy, the antigenicity of the 28 spots showed a few differences when SBR3 cell line was used as the source of antigens. Although some of the identified antigens were previously defined as tumor antigens, others were novel.

Participants were recruited in the United States, Mexico, and Spain. Cases with known estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status, with one or more full-term pregnancies ≥1 year prior to diagnosis were eligible for this analysis. Cases were classified into three tumor subtypes according to hormone receptor (HR+ = ER+ and/or PR+; HR- = ER- and PR-) expression and HER2 status: HR+/HER2-, HER2+ (regardless of HR), and triple negative breast cancer. Case-only odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for HER2+ tumors in reference to HR+/HER2- tumors.

Once the primary breast cancer is removed, there is an increasing need to detect breast cancer recurrence as early as possible with the hope that earlier intervention with new anti-HER2 therapies will improve quality of life and increase overall survival. Numerous publications have shown that increasing blood levels of circulating HER2 is an early indicator of progression, particularly in HER2-positive patients and that the rise and fall parallels the clinical course of disease and independent of therapy. Many studies show that the HER2 status of the primary tumor may not fully and accurately reflect the HER2 status of recurrent cancer. Thus, elevated serum HER2 levels may be an early signal of the emergence of a HER2-positive metastatic tumor and therefore alert the physician to re-assess HER2 status using a tissue test. ",

The patients were divided into groups according to the presence of diabetes and the types of medication used, and the patients' clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic indicators were explored. A total of 5,785 patients with luminal-type breast cancer admitted to Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between January 2002 and December 2006 were selected as the study subjects. The subjects included 680 breast cancer patients with diabetes and 5,105 breast cancer patients without diabetes. The patients were divided into Luminal A, Luminal B (high ki67), and Luminal B (her-2/neu+) subtypes. Each subtype was further divided into a metformin group, a non-metformin group, and a nondiabetic group. The research indicators included breast cancer mortality, age, body mass index (BMI), amenorrhea, the presence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, pathological stage, pathological type, lymph node involvement, vessel carcinoma embolus, and the chemotherapy and endocrine regimen. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to analyze the differences in breast cancer mortality rates among the groups. The Cox proportional hazard model was adopted to detect independent factors related to prognosis. Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis showed that for the Luminal A, Luminal B (high ki67), and Luminal B (her-2/neu+) subtypes, the cancer-specific mortality rates differed significantly among the metformin, non-metformin, and nondiabetic groups. The 5-year survival rates were 94%, 82%, and 91% (P = 0.002); 93.5%, 81%, and 89% (P < 0.001); and 84%, 77%, and 83% (P = 0.035) for the subtypes within each group, respectively. Cox regression multivariate analysis showed that compared with the metformin group, all three subtypes of the, the non-metformin group showed poorer prognosis (hazard ratio [HR], 3.579; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.506-8.506 [P = 0.004]; HR, 3.232; 95% CI, 1.839-5.678 [P < 0.001]; HR, 2.034; 95% CI,1.019-4.059 [P = 0.044] for Luminal A, Luminal B (high ki67), and Luminal B (her-2/neu+, respectively). Compared with the metformin group, the diabetic group showed poorer prognosis only for the Luminal B (high ki67) subtype (HR, 1.762; 95% CI, 1.033-3.005 [P = 0.038]). In addition, for the Luminal A, Luminal B (high ki67), and Luminal B (her-2/neu+) subgroups, there was a higher proportion of elderly patients (P < 0.001) and postmenopausal patients (P < 0.001) in the metformin and non-metformin groups than in the nondiabetic group. Moreover, the probability of having cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease was also higher (P < 0.001) in the metformin and non-metformin groups. For the Luminal B (high ki67) and Luminal B (her-2/neu +) subgroups, there was a higher proportion of obese patients in the metformin and non-metformin groups (P < 0.001). In terms of clinical characteristics, for the Luminal B (high ki67) subtype, the proportion of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma was lower in the non-metformin group than in the other two groups (P = 0.001). In both the metformin and non-metformin groups, the proportion of T3/4 patients was higher (P < 0.001), the proportion of patients with lymph node metastasis was higher (P = 0.001), and the proportion of patients with vessel carcinoma embolus was higher (P = 0.001) compared with the nondiabetic group. In conclusion, compared with the metformin group, the non-metformin group had a poorer prognosis for all subtypes of luminal breast cancer. In the diabetic group, only patients with the Luminal B (high ki67) subtype exhibited a poorer prognosis. Therefore, different diabetes medication may have a different impact on the prognosis of different subtypes of luminal breast cancer.",

Today, patients eligible for trastuzumab are selected using HER2 expression/amplification status of the primary tumor. However, acquired and inherent resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in these patients poses a significant challenge, and better patient stratification will be needed to improve clinical response. Here, we provide a wide-ranging overview of potential biomarkers capable of stratifying patients regarding their response to trastuzumab. These include HER2 amplification, impaired access to the binding site (p95HER2, Δ16HER-2, MUC4), augmented signaling through other ERBB family receptors (HER1, HER3, HER4) and their ligands, activation of HER2 targets by alternate heterodimers (EphA2, IGF-1R, GDF15, MUC1*), signaling triggered by downstream members (PIK3CA, PTEN, SRC, mTOR), altered expression of cell cycle and apoptotic regulators (CDKs, p27(kip1), Bcl-2), hormone receptor status, resistance to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (FcγR), and altered miRNA expression signatures. Multigenic molecular profile analyses have revealed further genes not directly associated with classical oncogenic pathways. Although numerous biomarkers have shown promise in pre-clinical studies, many have delivered controversial results when evaluated in clinical trials. One of the keys for targeting ERBB2 will be to consider the entire ERBB family and downstream associated pathways responsible for the malignant transformation. The heterogeneity of the disease is likely to represent a significant obstacle to accurately predicting the course of resistance. The future most probably involves the incorporation of multiple biomarkers into a unified predictor enabling selection of patients for superior targeted drug administration. ",

HER3 and HER4 mRNA level had a favourable prognostic value in terms of OS and disease-free survival (DFS), respectively. Adjusting for HER2 mRNA expression, OS and DFS did not differ between treatment groups. These data indicate that EGFR as well as HER2 are prognostic factors of worse clinical outcomes, whereas HER3 and HER4 gene transcription is associated with better prognosis in high-risk early breast cancer.

Amplification was typically high-level with more than 10-15 HER-2 copies per tumor cell. Amplification was unrelated to survival, grading, pT, pN, pM or UICC stage. We conclude that esophageal adenocarcinomas belong to those cancer types with relevant frequency high-level HER-2 gene amplification clinical trials or individual case studies investigating the response of metastatic HER-2-positive esophageal cancers to Herceptin((R)) should be undertaken. The strong concordance of the HER-2 status in primary and metastatic cancers argues for a possible response of metastases from patients with HER-2-positive primary tumors to Herceptin.",

First-line treatment with trastuzumab and taxanes demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival compared with taxane alone. Despite such a major advance, HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer will eventually progress in most patients. Moreover chemotherapy-associated toxicities, such as myelosuppression (docetaxel) and neurotoxicity (paclitaxel), may hamper the possibility to adequately treat metastatic breast cancer and may have a negative effect on patients' quality of life. The need for more effective and better-tolerated therapy for HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer led to the development of new anti-HER-2 agents. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine are two of the new agents that will change the approach to the treatment of HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds HER-2 at a different epitope of the HER-2 extracellular domain (subdomain II) than that at which trastuzumab binds. Trastuzumab emtansine is a HER-2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate, composed of the cytotoxic microtubule polymerization inhibitor DM1 that is conjugated to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, able to selectively deliver a cytotoxic agent to HER-2-positive tumor cells. TDM-1 is superior and less toxic than lapatinib plus capecitabine in metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with trastuzumab and taxanes, and its role as a first-line therapy is currently under investigation.",

Although breast cancer is an epithelial malignancy, stroma plays a key role in its development and pathogenesis. Stromal markers are now emerging as novel markers in assessing the prognosis of invasive breast cancer and have not been studied extensively till date. The aim of the present study is to study the stromal expression of CD10 in breast carcinoma, find its relationship with other prognostic markers and study the role stroma plays in breast cancer pathogenesis.;A total of 70 cases of breast cancer were included in the study. Representative sections were taken and hematoxylin and eosin staining was done. Immunohistochemistry was performed with ER, PR, Her2neu and CD10. Stromal expression of CD10 (>10% stromal positivity was considered positive) in invasive breast carcinoma was noted and was statistically analyzed with different known prognostic markers of breast carcinoma.;Stromal expression of CD10 was found to be significantly associated with increasing tumor grade (P = 0.04), increasing mitotic rate (P = 0.33), worsening prognosis (P = 0.01), ER negativity (P = 0.0001), Her2neu positivity (P = 0.19) and with molecular subtypes (CD10 positivity with the HER2 type, and CD10 negativity with Luminal type). No correlation was found between CD10 overexpression and PR, age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node positivity and tumor stage.;This study gives substantial proof to the various models/research papers explaining the role of stroma/CD10 in breast cancer pathogenesis. Keeping the role stroma plays in predicting prognosis and tumor response, CD10 should be included as a routine pre-chemotherapy marker in breast carcinoma. Further studies should be performed to see the role stroma plays in hormonal expression and the usefulness of CD10 to predict treatment failure in breast carcinomas receiving neoadjuvant therapy.",

The aims of this study were to provide a detailed molecular genetic analysis of the 17q12-q21 amplicon in breast cancers harbouring HER2/TOP2A co-amplification and to investigate additional recurrent co-amplifications in HER2/TOP2A-co-amplified cancers. In total, 15 breast cancers with HER2 amplification, 10 of which also harboured TOP2A amplification, as defined by chromogenic in situ hybridisation, and 6 breast cancer cell lines known to be amplified for HER2 were subjected to high-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation analysis. This revealed that the genomes of 12 cases were characterised by at least one localised region of clustered, relatively narrow peaks of amplification, with each cluster confined to a single chromosome arm (ie 'firestorm' pattern) and 3 cases displayed many narrow segments of duplication and deletion affecting the vast majority of chromosomes (ie 'sawtooth' pattern). The smallest region of amplification (SRA) on 17q12 in the whole series extended from 34.73 to 35.48 Mb, and encompassed HER2 but not TOP2A. In HER2/TOP2A-co-amplified samples, the SRA extended from 34.73 to 36.54 Mb, spanning a region of approximately 1.8 Mb. Apart from HER2 and TOP2A, this region encompassed four additional genes whose expression levels as defined by quantitative real-time PCR are significantly higher in HER2/TOP2A-co-amplified vs HER2-amplified breast cancers: CASC3, CDC6, RARA and SMARCE1. Of the cell lines studied, SKBR3 and UACC812 showed HER2/TOP2A co-amplification. In conclusion, this is the first detailed genome-wide characterisation of HER2/TOP2A-amplified breast cancers; cell lines were identified that can be used to model these cancers in vitro. The 17q12 amplicon is complex and harbours multiple genes that may be associated with breast cancer development and progression, and potentially exploitable as therapeutic targets.",

Nevertheless, since 30% of node-negative tumors also relapse, it is necessary to develop other independent prognostic factors. Oncogene amplification and the level of cathepsin D (cath-D), an acidic lysosomal protease produced and secreted in excess by breast cancer cells, have been proposed as additional prognostic factors. We have compared the cytosolic cath-D level and the amplification of three oncogenes: c-myc, neu-erb-B-2 and int-2 in 140 primary breast carcinomas and 64 axillary lymph nodes collected in 1987 and 1988 at the Cancer Center of Montpellier (Centre Paul Lamarque). None of the patients had previously received hormonal or chemotherapy. The cath-D concentration was measured with an immunoradiometric assay using monoclonal antibodies. DNA purified from the same samples was analyzed by a standard Southern blotting technique to estimate oncogene amplification. No correlation was found between the level of cath-D in the tumor and node invasiveness. Using a cut-off level of 60 pmol/mg protein, the status of cath-D was not correlated with neu-erb-B-2 and int-2 amplification and only correlated with c-myc amplification (P = 0.011). Both c-myc and cath-D are associated with cell proliferation, induced by estrogens in ER+ breast cancer, and constitutively produced in ER- breast cancer. The level of cath-D was significantly higher in the invaded lymph nodes (P = 0.04) than in the histologically non-invaded ones. Nevertheless, some non-invaded lymph nodes contained a high level of cath-D, as confirmed by immunoperoxidase staining. In conclusion, in breast cancer, a high cytosolic cath-D concentration is more frequent in tumors with c-myc amplification but is dissociated from neu-erb-B-2 or int-2 amplification, suggesting that the determination of these three markers will have an additional prognostic value.",

The majority of brain metastases were steroid hormone receptor negative (ER 66%, PR 82%) corresponding to the findings in primary tumours with known involvement of the CNS (68% ER-negative, 75% PR-negative).

In 2010, the phase III Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) trial showed that addition of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab to chemotherapy significantly improved survival of patients with advanced or metastatic tumors that were positive for HER2 overexpression. As a result, HER2 testing is now recommended for all patients with advanced or metastatic disease, although there is still some debate as to the optimal methods of assessment. HER2 expression in gastric and GEJ tumors shows several differences compared with breast tumors and, for this reason, the proposed criteria for scoring HER2 expression in biopsies and resections of gastric and GEJ carcinomas differ from those used in breast carcinomas. This review discusses what is currently known about the patterns of HER2 expression in gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas, summarizes the findings of the ToGA trial and its clinical implications, and provides an overview of the recommended guidelines for the most accurate evaluation of HER2 status in gastric and GEJ cancer.",

In 43 cases examined by FISH, HER2 gene amplification was detected in 95% (20/21) HER2 expression positive (3+) cases and in one equivocal (2+) cases. Three of 10 (30%) expression 2+ cases were equivocal for gene amplification. No gene amplification was detected in expression negative (1 +/0) cases by either SISH or FISH (0/20 and 0/12 respectively). The results of SISH and FISH were identical in 42 cases examined by the above two techniques, including 21 HER2 gene amplification positive, 2 equivocal and 19 negative cases. One case was FISH equivocal and SISH negative. And the overall concordance between FISH and SISH was 98%.;There is high concordance rate between SISH and FISH results for assessing the HER2 gene amplification status of excised breast cancer specimens.

        "Doc_abstract":"HER2, the erbB-2/neu proto-oncogene product, is a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Overexpression of HER2 was reported in several human adenocarcinomas, including mammary and ovarian carcinomas. A family of glycoproteins, the heregulin/neu differentiation factors, was characterized and implicated as the ligands for HER2. Recently, it has been shown that HER2 alone is not sufficient to reconstitute high affinity heregulin receptors and that HER3 or HER4 may be the required components of the heregulin receptors on mammary carcinoma cells (Sliwkowski, M.X., Schaefer, G., Akita, R.W., Lofgren, J.A., Fitzpatrick, V.D., Nuijens, A., Fendly, B.M., Cerione, R.A., Vandlen, R.L., and Carraway, K.L., III (1994) J.

Using the Cytosensor to measure the extracellular acidification rate, we have examined the effects of recombinant human heregulin-alpha on three mammary carcinoma cell lines expressing HER2 (MDA-MB-453, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7), an ovarian carcinoma cell line expressing HER2 (SK-OV-3), and CHO-K1 and 293-EBNA cells stably transfected with HER2. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, we found that the breast cells also express HER3 and that the ovarian line co-expresses the HER4 message. A dramatic increase in the acidification rate was observed for the mammary carcinoma cells co-expressing high levels of HER2 and HER3. In contrast, the ovarian cells expressing high levels of HER2 and low levels of HER4 or CHO-K1 and 293-EBNA cells expressing HER2 alone were not responsive to heregulin. When these same transfected cells were exposed to monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody followed by anti-IgG to cause aggregation of the HER2 molecules, an increase in the acidification rate was observed, indicating coupling of transfected HER2 to the signal transduction pathway. Transfection of HER2 into MCF-7 cells, on the other hand, gave 4-fold enhanced acidification responses. These data, together with the previously reported high affinity heregulin binding and activation of tyrosine phosphorylation in HER2 and HER3 co-transfected cells support the role of HER2 and HER3 as components of the heregulin receptor in breast cells.",

The present study retrospectively assessed the effects of HER-2/neu overexpression on the efficacy of oral fluoropyrimidine-based ACT and AET after breast cancer surgery.;The expression of HER-2/neu protein and estrogen receptor (ER) in 217 primary breast cancers was assessed immunohistochemically using the HercepTest and an anti-ER monoclonal antibody. The overexpression of HER-2/neu was classified into 4 categories (0-3+) according to standard criteria, and 3+ was categorized as HER-2/neu-overexpression. Of the 217 patients, 26 received surgery alone (SA), 32 received ACT, 20 received AET alone and 139 received both AET and ACT. The regimen of the ACT included oral fluoropyrimidines in all patients.;HER-2/neu (3+) overexpression and ER expression were seen in 31.8% (69 out of 217) and 47.5% (103 out of 217) of the patients, respectively. The survival of the HER-2/neu (3+) group was significantly lower than other groups (p = 0.0134), especially in the ER (+) patients (p = 0.0229). However, in the ER (+) patients, HER-2/neu overexpression had no significant effect. The effects of HER-2/neu overexpression and ER expression on the efficacy of the ACT and AET were analyzed by patient survival. In the ER (-) patients, the ACT (+) group had a significantly higher survival rate than the ACT (-) group (p = 0.0459), and this was noted especially in the HER-2/neu-overexpressing cases (p = 0.0485).

A total of 210 breast carcinomas were examined. Ready-to-use CB11 antibody was applied to detect HER-2/neu oncoprotein expression. In 76 out of 210 cases FISH was performed, and 162 cases were investigated with qPCR. Seventy-five tumors were 2+ or 3+ positive with immunohistochemistry, while 135 samples were either completely negative or 1+. In 45 cases results from all three methods were available. Out of these, in twenty negative and sixteen positive cases both FISH and qPCR led to similar results. The mean qPCR amplification ratio in the concordant positive cases was 5.424 while in the qPCR+/FISH- group the mean ratio was 2.765. Out of 121 samples with scores of 0 or 1+ immunohistochemical result, analyzed also with qPCR, 26 showed HER-2/neu gene amplification. In these cases the mean amplification ratio was 2.53. Comparison of FISH and qPCR together with immunohistochemistry shows that qPCR is more sensitive to detect HER-2/neu gene amplification in tumors scored as 2+ with immunohistochemistry, but the diagnostic cut-off ratio should be defined above 2.7 to avoid high number of false positive cases. Amongst the immunohistochemistry score 2+ cases, 10 of 18 showed gene amplification by qPCR while 10 of 26 by FISH. In conclusion, a well calibrated HER-2/neu qPCR assay may serve as useful alternative to FISH in breast cancer patients.",

To identify genetic factors modulating the response to HER2-targeted therapy, the numerical status of chromosome 17 was evaluated in HER2 gene-amplified tumor specimens from 43 patients who received trastuzumab-based treatment for advanced breast cancer, and in 60 unamplified breast carcinomas. Archival tumor specimens were analyzed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a centromeric probe for chromosome 17 simultaneously with the HER2/neu human gene-specific probe. In the 43 patients who received trastuzumab-based treatment, response rate and time to progression (TTP) were compared between subgroups according to chromosome 17 status. Numerical aberrations of chromosome 17 were found in 65% of HER2-amplified tumors (single centromeric signal, 44%; >3 centromeric signals, 21%) and 60% of unamplified cancers (single centromeric signal, 43%; >3 centromeric, 17%). In the 43 treated metastatic breast cancer patients, trastuzumab was combined with docetaxel (35 patients), paclitaxel (2 patients), or vinorelbine (6 patients). Response rate was 92% in patients with >2 centromeric signals (chromosome 17 eusomy/polysomy), and 53% in patients whose tumor showed a single signal (chromosome 17 monosomy) (p=0.005). Chromosome 17 numerical status was not found to affect TTP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that the effect of chromosome 17 monosomy on tumor response was independent of other potential clinical variables. Our findings suggest that 17 monosomy defines a subgroup of HER2 gene-amplified breast cancer characterized by reduced responsiveness to trastuzumab-based treatment. Further studies on the imbalance between the amplified HER2 gene and functionally antagonist gene(s) on chromosome 17 are warranted.",

According to this new biological classification, the objectives of our study were to assess the clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in order to classify this subtype of breast carcinoma. A total of 18 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma were identified from the Institut Curie files. Clinical information was available for 16 patients with a median follow-up of 6.5 years. Morphologically, all tumors were graded according to the system defined by Kleer and Oberman (histologic and nuclear grade). Immunophenotype was assessed with anti-ER, PR, HER-2, KIT, basal (CK5/6) and luminal cytokeratins (CK8/18) and p63 antibodies. One out of 18 tumors was nuclear grade 1 (16%), nine were nuclear grade 2 (50%) and eight were nuclear grade 3 (44%). All cases were estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2 negative. Epithelial cells were strongly positive around glandular lumina with one or both cytokeratins, identifying the coexistence of CK5/6+ cells, CK5/6 and CK8/18+ cells, CK8/18+ cells and p63+ cells. All cases (100%) were also KIT positive. In all, 15 patients were treated by surgery. Nine of them received adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up was available for 16 patients. In all, 14 patients were alive. Two of them, initially treated by surgery only, presented a local recurrence. Two patients died (one of them treated by radiation therapy only died from her disease). Our study shows that adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a special, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2 negative and highly KIT-positive, basal-like breast carcinoma, associated with an excellent prognosis.

Clinicopathological and DNA flow cytometric characteristics of male breast cancers (patient age, tumor size, histological type, histological grade, axillary lymph node status, hormone receptor expression, ploidy, and S-phase fraction) were compared with that of the control group of matched female breast cancers. Hormone receptors and HER-2/neu were investigated immunohistochemically with additional chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) analysis of HER-2/neu 2+ cases. Ploidy and S-phase fraction were determined by DNA flow cytometry. Comparison with clinicopathological features was made using χ (2) and t test. Aneuploidy was found in 78% of the cases, with the predomination of hypotetraploid clones (39%), followed by tetraploid (23%) and hypertetraploid clones (16%). We found higher frequency of hypertetraploidy in male breast cancers (16 and 6%, respectively) than in the control group of matched female breast cancers. Clinicopathological features of hypertetraploid male breast cancers did not differ from that of non-hypertetraploid cancers. Higher frequency of hypertetraploidy among male breast cancers might indicate different cytogenetical evolutionary pathway between male and female breast cancer.",

The purpose of the present study was to compare chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in determination of HER-2 status, in metastatic breast cancer patients screened for the clinical study of chemotherapy +/- herceptin. It was possible to assess both CISH and IHC in 56 cases, using CISH Detection Kit (Zymed) and HercepTest (DakoCytomation), respectively. HER-2 was amplified by CISH in 32 cases (57%) while 33 (59%) were HER-2-positive by IHC. A concordance between HER-2 status determined by CISH and IHC was noted in 43 of 56 cases (77%; P = 0.00008). Gene amplification was observed in 6/16 cases (37.5%) in IHC-negative subgroup (1+), while no amplification was observed in 5/10 cases (50%) in the IHC-positive subgroup (2+). These results suggest that there was a greater heterogeneity on the genetic level and that simple IHC classification was not sufficient.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adjuvant treatment is still only working in a small percentage of breast cancer patients. Therefore, new strategies need to be developed. Immunotherapies are a very promising approach because they could successfully attack tumor cells in the stage of dormancy. To assess the feasibility of using an allogeneic approach for vaccination of breast cancer patients, we selected a CD80-transfected breast cancer cell line based on its immunogenic properties. Using CD80+ KS breast cancer cells and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of breast cancer patients in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell cultures (MLTCs), it was possible to isolate HLA-A*02-restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Furthermore, a genetically modified KS variant expressing influenza A matrix protein serving as a surrogate tumor-associated antigen (TAA) was able to stimulate flu peptide-specific T cells alongside the induction of alloresponses in MLTCs. KS breast cancer cells were demonstrated to express already known TAAs such as CEA, MUC-1, MAGE-1, MAGE-2, and MAGE-3. To further improve antigenicity, HER-2/neu was added to this panel as a marker antigen known to elicit HLA-A*02-restricted CTLs in patients with breast cancer. Thus, the antigen-processing and antigen-presentation capacity of KS cells was further demonstrated by the stimulation of HER-2/neu-specific CD8+ T cells in PBMCs of breast cancer patients in vitro. These results gave a good rationale for a phase I/II trial, where the CD80+ HER-2/neu-overexpressing KS variant is actually used as a cellular vaccine in patients with metastatic breast cancer. As a proof of principle, we present data from two patients where a significant increase of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release was detected when postvaccination PBMCs were stimulated by allogeneic vaccine cells as well as by HLA-A*02-restricted HER-2/neu epitopes. In whole cell vaccine trials, monitoring is particularly challenging because of strong alloresponses and limited knowledge of TAAs. In this study, a panel of HER-2/neu epitopes, together with the quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR method to analyze vaccine-induced cytokines secreted by T cells, proved to be highly sensitive and feasible to perform an \"immunological staging\" following vaccination.",

Our goal was to evaluate the concordance, sensitivity, and specificity of a rabbit monoclonal antibody directed to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor (SP3) and compare it with fluorescence in situ hybridization and HercepTest in 179 invasive breast carcinomas. We found that SP3 was in agreement with fluorescence in situ hybridization results in 94.6% of cases. HercepTest and fluorescence in situ hybridization results were in agreement in 95.1% of the cases. Only 4.3% (4/93) of the cases that scored 0/1+ by SP3 were amplified by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and 8.3% (3/36) of cases that scored 3+ were not amplified by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Comparing SP3 with HercepTest, we observed that HercepTest demonstrated higher sensitivity (100.0% vs. 89.0%) but SP3 demonstrated higher specificity (97.0% vs. 89.0%). An important advantage of SP3 (in comparison with HercepTest) is its higher discrimination power (72.1% vs. 34.1%).

Seven patients underwent double lumpectomies for multicentric carcinoma. Median age was 69 years (range, 61 to 80 years). In five patients, MRI identified ipsilateral  second malignancies. All patients had two foci of invasive carcinoma, all tumors expressed estrogen receptor, and none showed HER-2 overexpression. Tumor sizes ranged from 0.7 to 2.9 cm. Six patients had histologically distinct tumors in the same breast: five had one invasive lobular carcinoma  (ILC) and one invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and one had classic ILC in one quadrant and pleomorphic ILC in another. One patient had two foci of IDC in separate quadrants. All patients had sentinel lymph node biopsies and none had nodal metastasis. Median follow-up was 26 months (range,  18 to 85 months).

We show here that K1 also inhibits human HER-2/neu promoter in human ovarian cancer cells. To investigate whether K1 can suppress HER-2/neu transformation and thus is a potential therapeutic agent, we used an orthotopic ovarian cancer model in which mice were injected intraperitoneally with HER-2/neu-overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells to induce tumor development. The tumor-bearing mice were then treated with K1-liposome complex weekly. We found that liposome-mediated K1 gene transfer decreased the p185 protein level by K1 expression in these cancer cells and significantly prolonged mice survival; about 40% of these treated mice were alive for more than 1 year without any tumor development. On the other hand, the animals from control groups that did not receive this gene therapy all developed tumors and died within 7 months.

Transfection studies were carried out in both HER2 overexpressing Sk-Br-3 and HER2 low-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The HerPEI polyplexes showed significantly greater transfection activity up to 20-folds than nonderivatized PEI-based polyplexes in the Sk-Br-3 cells. The transfection efficiency of targeted polyplexes was dependent on the trastuzumab:PEI ratio and can be blocked by excess free trastuzumab, suggesting HER2-mediated gene delivery. In contrast, no significant difference in transfection activities was observed between HER2-targeted and nontargeted polyplexes in the HER2 low-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells.

The localization of SIX1 protein was detected in MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells using immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the relationship between prognostic factors and patient survival was also analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard models. SIX1 protein mainly showed cytoplasmic/perinuclear staining pattern in breast cancer using IHC in paraffin embedded breast cancer tissues and IF in MDA-MB468 cancer cells. The strongly positive rate of SIX1 protein was 61.8% (162/262) in breast cancer and 23.1% (12/52) in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which was significantly higher than adjacent normal breast tissues (6.7%, 3/45). SIX1 overexpression was positively correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, Her2 expression status, and disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with breast cancer. Moreover, patients with late stage breast cancer and high SIX1 expression had poorer survival rates than those with low SIX1 expression. Further analysis using a Cox proportional hazard regression model revealed that high SIX1 expression emerged as a significant independent hazard factor for the DFS and OS rates of patients with breast cancers along with Her2 status and clinical stage.

Other glands developed hyperplastic epithelium, sometimes with multilayering of the cells and/or atypical changes such as abnormally large nuclei. In human breasts such lesions would be termed mild or atypical hyperplasia. In all the abnormal areas examined, levels of neu protein above background level were detected by immunohistochemistry. Some staining was localized to membranes (as observed in ductal carcinoma in situ in humans) but cytoplasmic staining was also common in the lesions induced in mice by the neu oncogene.

However, besides its cytotoxic effects on malignant cells it might also affect the biology of surviving cells. Since overexpression of HER-2 receptors on malignant cells is a prerequisite for the therapeutic efficacy of Herceptin, it seems important to know whether previous irradiation changes their overexpression. The experiments performed in this work were aimed to determine whether X-ray irradiation of MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cell lines, besides its cytotoxic action, affects the overexpression of HER-2 protein. Determination of the cytotoxic effect of X-ray irradiation was done using trypan blue test. The breast carcinoma cell responsiveness to herceptin treatment in the presence of 10% fresh human serum (from healthy volunteer's) in the presence or absence of 25 microg/ml of herceptin, in vitro before and after cell-irradiation, was evaluated by MTT test. The degree of HER-2 overexpression was determined by immunocytochemistry, using DAKO HercepTest. Preliminary results obtained in this work showed that X-ray irradiation, besides its cytotoxic effect on malignant cells, could lead to overexpression of HER-2 receptors on (initially by immunocytochemistry, HER-2 negative) tumor cells, indicating change in biology of treated tumor cells. Further investigation in this direction will probably be helpful to elucidate this task in order to improve the selection of irradiated patients for Herceptin therapy.",

Fifty-one paraffin-embedded BIDCs and their paired non-cancerous breast tissues were dissected for DNA extraction. The mtDNA copy number and mtDNA D310 sequence variations were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and PCR-based direct sequencing, respectively. The expression levels of ER, PR, HER-2/neu, p53 and Ki-67 were determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Compared to the paired non-cancerous breast tissues, 24 (47.1%) BIDCs had elevated mtDNA copy numbers and 29 (56.9%) harbored mtDNA D310 mutations. Advanced T-status (p=0.056), negative-ER (p=0.005), negative-PR (p=0.007), positive-p53 (p=0.050) and higher Ki-67 (p=0.004) expressions were related to a higher mtDNA copy ratio. In addition, advanced T-status (p=0.019) and negative-HER-2/neu expression (p=0.061) were associated with mtDNA D310 mutations. In conclusion, higher mtDNA copy ratio and D310 mutations may be relevant biomarkers correlated with pathological T-status and the expression levels of ER, PR, HER-2/neu, p53 and Ki-67 in BIDCs. ",

The metastasis gene osteopontin is subject to alternative splicing, which yields 3 messages, osteopontin-a, osteopontin-b and osteopontin-c. Osteopontin-c is selectively expressed in invasive, but not in noninvasive, breast tumor cell lines, and it effectively supports anchorage independence. We evaluated osteopontin-c as a biomarker. The RNA message for osteopontin-c was present in 16 of 20 breast cancers (80%), but was undetectable in 22 normal specimens obtained from reduction mammoplasty. In contrast, osteopontin-a RNA was expressed at various levels in all 20 breast cancers, 11 tumor-surrounding tissues and 21 normal samples. The splice variant osteopontin-b was present at barely detectable levels in 18 of 20 cancers and in 6 of 22 normal breasts. By immunohistochemistry, 66 of 69 normal breasts were negative, while 3 showed low level staining. Among the breast cancers, 43 of 56 cores (77%) stained positive for osteopontin-c. When correlated with tumor grade, the staining for osteopontin-c increased from grade 1 to grade 3. In a total of 178 breast specimens analyzed, osteopontin-c was present in 78% of cancers, 36% of surrounding tissues and 0% of normal tissues. Furthermore, osteopontin-c detects a higher fraction of breast cancers than estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor or HER2. In conjunction, osteopontin-c, ER and HER2 reliably predict grade 2-3 breast cancer. Hence, osteopontin-c is a diagnostic and prognostic marker that may have value in a diagnostic panel together with conventional breast cancer markers.",

Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR detected overexpression of a cell cycle-related transcription factor, E2F-5, in ER-negative breast cancers, and fluorescence in situ hybridisation detected gene amplification of E2F-5 in 5 out of 57 (8.8%) breast cancer samples. No point mutations were found in the DNA-binding or DNA-dimerisation domain of E2F-5. Immunohistochemically, E2F-5-positive cancers correlated with a higher Ki-67 labelling index (59.5%, P=0.001) and higher histological grades (P=0.049).

Disease-free survival in node-negative patients with E2F-5-positive cancers was shorter than for patients with E2F-5-negative cancers. In conclusion, we identify, for the first time, a population of breast cancer cells that overexpress the cell cycle-related transcription factor, E2F-5.

We examined the effects of antisense Bcl-2 and HER-2 oligonucleotides (ODN) to assess the mechanism(s) through which down-regulation of Bcl-2 and HER-2 enhances drug-sensitivity. Using two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and BT-474, the antitumor effects of a combination of antisense ODN and anticancer drugs, including mitomycin C (MMC), adriamycin (ADM), paclitaxel (TXL), and docetaxel (TXT) was evaluated. The expression of Bcl-2 protein was suppressed by treatment with antisense Bcl-2 ODN in a dose-dependent manner. An enhanced drug-sensitivity to MMC and TXL upon pretreatment with antisense Bcl-2 ODN was observed, with the IC50 values increasing 1.9- and 2.0-fold, respectively. Treatment of BT-474 cells with antisense HER-2 at 1.0 micro M suppressed HER-2 overexpression by 60.5%. Pretreatment with antisense HER-2 ODN increased the sensitivity of these cells to ADM and TXL 20.8- and 10.8-fold, respectively. In vivo experiments using a combination of antisense HER-2 and TXL showed the similar enhancement of antitumor effect of TXL as compared to that of antisense HER-2 or TXL alone (p=0.068). Enhancement of drug-sensitivity was associated with the induction of apoptosis. Of interest, treatment with antisense HER-2 ODN also suppressed the expression of Bcl-2 and pAkt. These results indicate that down-regulation of Bcl-2 and HER-2 increased drug-sensitivity by modulating drug-induced apoptotic pathways in breast cancer cells, and that antisense ODN therapy, targeting Bcl-2 and HER-2 may be a useful strategy to enhance drug-sensitivity.",

We tested the prognostic value of kinase metagenes in 684 node-negative patients who received no adjuvant therapy and the predictive value in 233 patients who received uniform neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve kinases were overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, 7 in HER2(+), and 28 in ER(-)/HER2(-) cancers, respectively. We examined the functional role of 22 kinases overexpressed in ER(-)/HER2(-) cancers using siRNA. Downregulation of these kinases caused significant subtype-specific inhibition of cell growth in vitro. Two robust kinase clusters, including an immune kinase cluster and a mitosis kinase cluster, were present in all clinical subgroups. High mitosis kinase score was associated with worse prognosis but higher pathologic complete response (pCR) in ER(+)/HER2(-) cancers, but not in ER(-)/HER2(-) or HER2(+) cancers, in univariate and multivariate analyses including other genomic predictors (MammaPrint, genomic grade index, and the 76-gene signature). Conversely, higher immune kinase score was associated with better survival in ER(+)/HER2(-) and HER2(+) tumors and also predicted higher probability of pCR in HER2(+) cancers.

However, there have been few studies of its clinicopathological significance. We used tissue microarrays to evaluate two aspects of intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification: regional heterogeneity and genetic heterogeneity. We examined 96 invasive breast cancers in which HER2 amplification had been diagnosed in whole sections, and determined the clincopathological characteristics of those tumors. HER2 regional heterogeneity, defined as the existence of amplification/negative or amplification/equivocal patterns in different tissue microarray cores of a tumor, was present in 17 (18%) of the 96 cases. HER2 genetic heterogeneity, defined as the presence of tumor cells with a HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 ratio higher than 2.2 in 5-50% of the tumor cells, was found in 11 cases (11%), all of which showed HER2 regional heterogeneity. The cases with intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification were characterized by low grade or equivocal HER2 amplification and equivocal (2+) HER2 expression in whole sections. The patients with intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification had significantly shorter disease-free survival times than those with homogeneous HER2 gene amplification, and this effect was also evident in subgroup analysis by hormone receptor status. In multivariate analysis, intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity retained its status as an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival. In conclusion, intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification is present in a subset of HER2-amplified breast cancers, especially in cases with low-grade HER2 amplification and equivocal HER2 expression, indicating a need for HER2 testing on more representative, larger tumor samples for accurate assessment of HER2 status in such cases. The patients with this heterogeneity have decreased disease-free survival, suggesting that genetic instability, and hence aberrant HER2 amplification in subclones of such tumors, may be associated with breast cancer progression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"HER2 is overexpressed in 15-20% of breast cancers. HER2 overexpression is known to reduce apoptosis but the underlying mechanisms for this association remain unclear. To elucidate the mechanisms for HER2-mediated survival, we investigated the relationship between HER2 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), a potent apoptosis inducer. Our results showed that HER2 interacts with PUMA, which was independent of HER2 activation. In addition, we observed that HER2 interacted with PUMA in both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial compartments. We next examined whether HER2 phosphorylates PUMA. Notably, PUMA tyrosine phosphorylation has never been reported. Using an intracellular assay, we found PUMA to be phosphorylated in breast cancer cells with activated HER2. Via cell-free HER2 kinase assay, we observed that PUMA was directly phosphorylated by HER2. Activation of HER2 decreased PUMA protein half-life. To identify which of the three tyrosines within PUMA are targeted by HER2, we generated three PUMA non-phosphorylation mutants each with a single Tyr→Phe substitution. Results indicated that each PUMA single mutant had lost some, but not all phosphorylation by HER2 indicating that HER2 targets all three tyrosines. Consequently, we created an additional PUMA mutant with all three tyrosines mutated (TM-PUMA) that could not be phosphorylated by HER2. Importantly, TM-PUMA was found to have a longer half-life than PUMA. An inverse association was observed between HER2 and PUMA in 93 invasive breast carcinoma samples. We further found that TM-PUMA suppressed growth of breast cancer cells to a greater degree than PUMA. Also, TM-PUMA had a stronger propensity to induce apoptosis than PUMA. Together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that PUMA can be tyrosine phosphorylated and that HER2-mediated phosphorylation destabilizes PUMA protein. The HER2-PUMA interplay represents a novel mechanism by which PUMA is regulated and a new molecular basis for HER2-mediated growth and survival of cancer cells. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although current breast cancer treatment guidelines limit the use of HER2-blocking agents to tumors with HER2 gene amplification, recent retrospective analyses suggest that a wider group of patients may benefit from this therapy. Using breast cancer cell lines, mouse xenograft models and matched human primary and metastatic tissues, we show that HER2 is selectively expressed in and regulates self-renewal of the cancer stem cell (CSC) population in estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), HER2(-) luminal breast cancers. Although trastuzumab had no effects on the growth of established luminal breast cancer mouse xenografts, administration after tumor inoculation blocked subsequent tumor growth. HER2 expression is increased in luminal tumors grown in mouse bone xenografts, as well as in bone metastases from patients with breast cancer as compared with matched primary tumors. Furthermore, this increase in HER2 protein expression was not due to gene amplification but rather was mediated by receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK)-ligand in the bone microenvironment. These studies suggest that the clinical efficacy of adjuvant trastuzumab may relate to the ability of this agent to target the CSC population in a process that does not require HER2 gene amplification. Furthermore, these studies support a CSC model in which maximal clinical benefit is achieved when CSC targeting agents are administered in the adjuvant setting.

Amplification of the her-2/neu gene occurs in approximately 25% of invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. The first HER-2/neu-targeted approach to reach the clinic was trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu protein. Trastuzumab therapy prolongs the survival of patients with metastático HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer when combined with chemotherapy and has recently been demonstrated to lead to dramatic improvements in disease-free survival when used in the adjuvant therapy setting in combination with or following chemotherapy. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of completed clinical trials of adjuvant trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. Survival, recurrence, brain metastases, cardiotoxicity and directions for future research are discussed.;A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) was performed comparing adjuvant trastuzumab treatment for HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) to observation. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT and Cochrane Library databases, and abstracts published in the annual proceedings were systematically searched for evidence. Relevant reports were reviewed by two reviewers independently and the references from these reports were searched for additional trials, using guidelines set by QUOROM statement criteria.;Pooled results from that five randomized trials of adjuvant Trastuzumab showed a significant reduction of mortality (p < 0.00001), recurrence (p < 0.00001), metastases rates (p < 0.00001) and second tumors other than breast cancer (p = 0.007) as compared to no adjuvant Trastuzumab patients. There were more grade III or IV cardiac toxicity after trastuzumab (203/4555 = 4.5%) versus no trastuzumab (86/4562 = 1.8%). The likelihood of cardiac toxicity was 2.45-fold higher (95% CI 1.89 - 3.16) in trastuzumab arms, however that result was associated with heterogeneity. The likelihood of brain metastases was 1.82-fold higher (95% CI 1.16 - 2.85) in patients who received trastuzumab.;The results from this meta-analysis are sufficiently compelling to consider 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment for women with HER-2-positive EBC based on the risk: benefit ratio demonstrated in these studies. Adequate assessment of HER-2/neu status is critical, and careful cardiac monitoring is warranted because of cardiac toxicity. Clinical trials should be designed to answer unsolved questions.",

A group of investigators who are experienced in the conduct and interpretation of HER-2 assay methods reviewed the ASCO-CAP guidelines and address several areas of the HER-2 testing guidelines with a particular emphasis on biologic and methodologic considerations. Although HER-2 status determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the status determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are significantly correlated, we feel that standard considerations of laboratory testing, including test accuracy, reproducibility, and precision, as well as the current data favor FISH over IHC assay methods for determining HER-2 status. These considerations are clearly important in clinical practice because HER2 amplification is directly linked to protein expression levels in breast cancer. However, this protein is not consistently analyzed in formalin-fixed tissues as a result of variability in fixation methods and times and the impact of fixation on HER-2 protein antigenicity. Conversely, gene amplification and FISH are significantly less dependent on tissue fixation methods, making this assay more reproducible between central and peripheral laboratories than IHC. Moreover, review of the existing data demonstrate that FISH is more strongly correlated with responsiveness to either trastuzumab or lapatinib treatment. Until other methods achieve similar test accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive value, we suggest FISH as the primary HER-2 testing modality for women with breast cancer who are candidates for HER-2-targeted therapies.",

The method processes microscopy images from tissue slides with a multistage algorithm, including steps of color pixel classification, nuclei segmentation, and cell membrane modeling, and extracts quantitative, continuous measures of cell membrane staining intensity and completeness. A minimum cluster distance classifier merges the features to classify the slides into HER2 categories. An evaluation based on agreement analysis with pathologist-derived HER2 scores, showed good agreement with the provided truth. Agreement varied within the different classes with highest agreement (up to 90%) for positive (3+) slides, and lowest agreement (72%-78%) for equivocal (2+) slides which contained ambiguous scoring.

However, in each of four other models (TgWAP-T121, TgMMTV-Wnt1, Brca1Co/Co;TgMMTV-Cre;p53+/- and DMBA-induced), tumors with a variety of histologies and expression profiles developed. In many models, similarities to human breast tumors were recognized, including proliferation and human breast tumor subtype signatures. Significantly, tumors of several models displayed characteristics of human basal-like breast tumors, including two models with induced Brca1 deficiencies. Tumors of other murine models shared features and trended towards significance of gene enrichment with human luminal tumors; however, these murine tumors lacked expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and ER-regulated genes. TgMMTV-Neu tumors did not have a significant gene overlap with the human HER2+/ER- subtype and were more similar to human luminal tumors.;Many of the defining characteristics of human subtypes were conserved among the mouse models.

        "Doc_abstract":"Currently, only patients with HER2-positive tumors are candidates for HER2-targeted therapies. However, recent clinical observations suggest that the survival of patients with HER2-low breast cancers, who lack HER2 amplification, may benefit from adjuvant therapy that targets HER2. In this study, we explored a mechanism through which these benefits may be obtained. Prompted by the hypothesis that HER2/HER3 signaling in breast tumor-initiating cells (TIC) promotes self-renewal and survival, we obtained evidence that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) produced by TICs promotes their proliferation and self-renewal in HER2-low tumors, including in triple-negative breast tumors. Pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR, HER2, or both receptors reduced breast TIC survival and self-renewal in vitro and in vivo and increased TIC sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Through a tissue microarray analysis, we found that NRG1 expression and associated HER2 activation occurred in a subset of HER2-low breast cancers. Our results offer an explanation for why HER2 inhibition blocks the growth of HER2-low breast tumors. Moreover, they argue that dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 may offer a useful therapeutic strategy to target TICs in these tumors. In generating a mechanistic rationale to apply HER2-targeting therapies in patients with HER2-low tumors, this work shows why these therapies could benefit a considerably larger number of patients with breast cancer than they currently reach.",

The clinical, radiological and pathological findings were recorded. Immunohistochemistry for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 was performed. Thirty-one patients had no concurrent breast cancer or past history of breast cancer, and six (19.4%) of these had local recurrence; all tumours (four invasive carcinoma and two PLCIS) were ipsilateral. Younger age at presentation was a risk factor for local recurrence: patients with recurrence had a mean age (range) of 52.5 years (44-59 years), versus 60.6 years (40-81 years) for those without (P = 0.03). Three of 31 patients were treated with radiation therapy (RT), and none of these developed local recurrence. PLCIS had an adverse ER/PR/HER2 molecular profile, with at least 41.2% of the cases overexpressing HER2. Moreover, at least 11.7% of the cases were triple-negative.;This study included the largest number of patients who had no concurrent breast cancer or past history of breast cancer with the longest clinical follow-up, providing insights into management practices for PLCIS and the risk of recurrence.",

In the present study, we described a Phase-1 vaccination trial in gastric cancer patients using dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with the immunodominant HER-2/neu(p369) peptides.;Nine enrolled patients, who had HER-2/neu-overexpressing tumors and who were HLA-A2 positive, received four vaccinations by DCs pulsed with HER-2(p369) peptide at 2-week intervals intradermally.;There were no serious adverse effects noted in the immunized patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, preimmunization and after the fourth immunization, were cultured with autologous, HER-2(p369)-pulsed antigen-presenting cells for 12 days. Thereafter, peptide specificity was evaluated by IFN-gamma secretion assay from cultured T cells against T2 cells pulsed with HER-2(p369) peptide. HER-2/neu peptide-specific recognition could be demonstrated in six of nine patients after immunization, whereas there was no HER-2/neu peptide-specific recognition before immunization. The peptide-specific CTL lines isolated from two of the patients could also lyse a HER2/neu-transfected cell line. Furthermore, a peptide-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity response occurred in three of nine patients. One of the patients underwent a partial clinical response concurrent with a decrease of tumor marker.

This work aimed to estimate likelihood of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in breast cancer patients based on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Primary tumors of 317 breast cancer patients were evaluated for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry. The validity of these molecules to predict ALN metastasis was measured statistically and compared to predictive effect of other clinicopathological parameters. ER, PR and HER2 expression was detected in 75.7%, 73.2% and 19.9% of tumors, respectively. Although increased tumor size and grade, ER and PR negativity and HER2 positivity were strong indicators of ALN metastasis on univariate analyses, only tumor size and HER2 expression were independent predictors of ALN involvement on multivariate analysis. ROC curve showed a strong validity of the model using these two parameters to predict ALN status (AUC 0.86; p<0001). HER2-rich, luminal B and triple negative tumors had 6.87, 6.32 and 3.58 times increased risk of metastasis compared to luminal A tumors; respectively. HER2 expression in pT1 and pT2 tumors raised the risk of ALN metastasis by 7.7 and 7.6 times, respectively and grade 1 and 2 tumors that expressed HER2 were 16.0 and 7.8 times more likely to have ALN metastasis, respectively. To conclude, HER2 expression is associated with a significant rise of metastatic potential of breast cancer cells and could be a strong indicator of regional and distant metastasis of breast cancer.",

Although these advances have shaped our understanding of the underlying biology of breast cancer, most clinical decisions are currently based on tumor expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These biomarkers have prognostic and predictive significance in breast cancer and have important implications for tumor growth and metastatic patterns. In this review, we focus on the three broad phenotypes of breast cancer used in clinical practice; ER/PR positive, HER2 positive and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is characterized by lack of expression of ER, PR and HER2.

Inhibition of FAS with C75 has led to a significant antitumor effect in both human breast and prostate cancer xenografts. Recently, HER2/neu, which has also been identified in preneoplastic breast lesions, has been shown to regulate FAS expression through the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway rendering them susceptible to FAS inhibition. Utilizing the neu-N transgenic mouse model of mammary cancer, weekly treatment of the neu-N mice with C75 (30 mg/kg) for 10 weeks significantly delayed tumor progression. Only 20% of the C75-treated transgenic mice developed mammary carcinoma by 220 days, compared to 50% in the vehicle control animals. Two C75-treated animals never developed mammary cancer. Analysis of mammary tissue following 10 weeks of C75 treatment revealed a significant delay in mammary maturation as manifested by a reduction of the number and caliber of mammary ducts and budding epithelial structures. Apoptotic changes were increased, DNA synthesis was decreased, and the expressions of FAS, neu, Akt, phospho-Akt, and p21(waf1) were all decreased when compared to vehicle controls and FVB/N mice. Importantly, these effects were restricted to the breast epithelial cells that overexpressed neu, not involving other normal duct structures in the skin, liver, or kidney. C247, an FAS inhibitor chemically distinct from C75, significantly delayed mammary maturation similar to C75.

However, the involvement of estrogen signaling in regulation of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells has not been fully established, mainly because expression and function of ER-α in breast cancer stem cells remains controversial. Previously, our laboratory cloned a variant of ER-α, ER-α36, and found that ER-α36-mediated non-genomic estrogen signaling plays an important role in malignant growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that ER-α36 was highly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells and mediated non-genomic estrogen signaling such as activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling in these cells. Knock-down of ER-α36 expression in these cells using the shRNA method diminished their responsiveness to estrogen and significantly down-regulated HER2 expression. HER2 signaling activated ER-α36 transcription through an AP1 site in the ER-α36 promoter and ER-α36 physically interacted with HER2. We also found that ER-α36 is highly expressed in a subset of SK-BR-3 cells that was positive for ALDH1, a breast cancer stem cell marker, and knock-down of ER-α36 expression reduced the population of ALDH1 positive cells. Our results thus demonstrated that ER-α36 positively regulates HER2 expression and the population of ALDH1 positive breast cancer cells, and suggested that non-genomic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 is involved in maintenance and regulation of breast cancer stem cells.",

In breast cancer patients, overexpression of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is correlated with aggressive tumor growth and increased recurrence. In the present study, we demonstrate that HER2 expression can be induced by radiation in breast cancer cells with a low basal level of HER2. Furthermore, HER2-postive tumors occur at a much higher frequency in recurrent invasive breast cancer (59%) compared to the primary tumors (41%). Interestingly, NF-kappaB is required for radiation-induced HER2 transactivation. HER2 was found to be co-activated with basal and radiation-induced NF-kappaB activity in radioresistant but not radiosensitive breast cancer cell lines after long-term radiation exposure, indicating that NF-kappaB-mediated HER2 overexpression is involved in radiation-induced repopulation in heterogeneous tumors. Finally, we found that inhibition of HER2 resensitizes the resistant cell lines to radiation. Since HER2 is shown to activate NF-kappaB, our data suggest a loop-like HER2-NF-kappaB-HER2 pathway in radiation-induced adaptive resistance in breast cancer cells.",

However, de novo or acquired resistance is common, despite the development of newer agents against these pathways. As our understanding of tumor biology improves, novel targets are being identified. Notably, inhibitors against several pathways [including, among others, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR), cell-cycle regulation, heat shock protein, and epigenetic pathways] have demonstrated promising activity in clinical trials, and the mTOR-inhibitor everolimus has been approved for advanced or metastatic aromatase inhibitor-resistant ER(+) breast cancer. At present, there are no established targeted agents for triple-negative breast cancer (negative ER, progesterone receptor, and HER2). Although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors have shown promising activity in BRCA-related cancers, its value in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers remains to be demonstrated.

We examined clinical variables per primary tumor subtype: ER+/HER2- (luminal), HER2+ (human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-enriched) or ER-/PR-/HER2- (triple negative). We also categorized patients' breast cancer-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment scores and analyzed post-brain metastasis survival time in relation to these categories.;The breast cancers comprised the following subtypes: luminal, n = 18; human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-enriched, n = 27 and triple-negative, n = 18; median survival per subtype was 11, 37 and 3 months, respectively. Survival of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-enriched patients was longer, though not significantly (P = 0.188), than that of luminal patients. Survival of triple-negative patients was significantly short (vs. human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-enriched patients, P < 0.001).

The relative ERBB2 copy number determined by FISH in 10 breast cancer cell lines correlated strongly with Southern blot results (r = 0.98) when probes for an identical reference locus were used in the two methods. Metaphase analysis of cell lines showed that amplified ERBB2 copies always occurred in intrachromosomal clusters but that the number and chromosomal location of these clusters varied among the cell lines. In interphase nuclei of primary tumors showing ERBB2 amplification (10/44), ERBB2 copies were seen as one to four clusters, also suggesting intrachromosomal localization. Regardless of the average level of amplification, all these tumors contained highly amplified cell subpopulations with at least 25, and sometimes more than 100, ERBB2 copies per cell. Tumors that did not show amplification by FISH (34/44) had an average of one to five ERBB2 copies scattered randomly in the nuclei and completely lacked cells with high copy levels.

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against HER-2 which has revolutionized the management of both early and advanced breast cancer. It may exert its anti-cancer effects through inhibition of intracellular signaling, upregulation of p27, impaired angiogenesis, induction of immune-mediated destruction, and blockade of cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2. In spite of its robust clinical activity, most women with metastatic HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer eventually progress on trastuzumab therapy. Possible mechanisms of resistance include: altered receptor antibody interaction, PTEN loss and enhanced Akt signaling, p27 loss, signaling through other receptors. Preclinical experiments, clinical experience with the use of trastuzumab beyond progression, and a recent phase III clinical trial with Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, demonstrate that the HER-2 signaling axis remains an important therapeutic target even after progression on trastuzumab. A variety of novel strategies are currently in development to exploit this pathway following the onset of resistance, such as receptor antibodies, sheddase inhibitors, signal transduction inhibitors, heat shock protein inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and immune-stimulatory therapies, either as single agents or in combination with trastuzumab.

Therefore, in the present study, we examined the clinical significance and the biological functions of CITED2 in breast carcinoma by immunohistochemistry and in vitro study. CITED2 immunoreactivity was detected in breast carcinoma tissues, and it was significantly higher compared to those in morphologically normal mammary glands. CITED2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with stage, pathological T factor, lymph node metastasis, histological grade, HER2 and Ki-67, and inversely correlated with estrogen receptor. Moreover, the immunohistochemical CITED2 status was significantly associated with increased incidence of recurrence and breast cancer-specific death of the breast cancer patients, and multivariate analyses demonstrated CITED2 status as an independent worse prognostic factor for disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival. Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that CITED2 expression significantly increased proliferation activity and migration property in MCF-7and S KBR-3 breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, CITED2 caused chemoresistance to epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil, but not paclitaxel, in these cells, and it inhibited p53 accumulation after 5-fluorouracil treatment in MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that CITED2 plays important roles in the progression and chemoresistance of breast carcinoma and that CITED2 status is a potent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients.",

Preclinical models have demonstrated that this antibody has significant antitumor activity as a single agent, and it also has a synergy with certain chemotherapeutic drugs. Phase II and III clinical trials performed in women with metastatic breast cancers that overexpress HER2 have shown trastuzumab to have clinical activity when used as monotherapy, while also improving survival when used as a first-line therapy in combination with chemotherapy.

Statistical analyses showed that the differences between IHC and FISH assays were primarily in the specimens with medium positive IHC, but negative FISH results.;Because of the increasing importance of the Her-2/neu oncogene and oncoprotein in the clinical management of patients with breast cancer, the accurate and consistent evaluation of Her-2/neu status is crucial. This study suggests that the best approach is to combine both IHC and FISH assays; that is, to use the IHC assay as a triage step, followed by the PathVysion FISH assay to analyse the IHC medium and high positive cases.",

Overexpression of Her2 has been associated with a more aggressive phenotype with decreased survival. Trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against the Her2 receptor, is the only FDA-approved targeted agent for treatment of Her2-overexpressing breast cancer. However, despite the great success achieved with trastuzumab, many women will either not respond or eventually progress despite trastuzumab treatment. As a result, significant efforts have been applied to finding other therapies besides trastuzumab for the treatment of Her2-positive breast cancer.

These two pharmacologic agents prevent nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and induce nuclear accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1), suggesting that combining bortezomib with trastuzumab could increase trastuzumab efficacy.;Drug cytotoxicity, both individually and together, and drug effects on p27 localization and NF-kappaB activation were investigated on four breast cancer cell lines: SKBR-3 (HER-2+++), MDA-MB-453 (HER-2++), HER-2-transfected MCF-7 (HER-2+++), and MCF-7 (HER-2-).;Bortezomib induced apoptosis in HER-2-positive and HER-2-negative breast cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Together, these drugs induced apoptosis of HER-2++/+++ cells at low concentrations, which had no effect when used alone, indicating there was a synergistic effect. Sequential treatment (trastuzumab then bortezomib) induced either necrosis or apoptosis, depending on the trastuzumab preincubation time. Susceptibility to bortezomib alone and the drug combination correlated with NF-kappaB activity and p27 localization.;The addition of bortezomib to trastuzumab increases the effect of trastuzumab in HER-2+++/++ cell lines in a synergistic way. This effect likely results from the ability of these two drugs to target the NF-kappaB and p27 pathways.

However, there is considerable variation in the reported rates of HER2 overexpression and amplification, likely--at least in part--resulting from variability in the testing methods, interpretation, and scoring criteria used. Unlike in breast and gastric cancer, currently there are no established guidelines for HER2 testing in endometrial carcinoma. A total of 108 endometrial carcinoma cases--85 pure serous carcinomas and 23 mixed endometrial carcinomas with serous component--were identified over a 4-year period. All H&E and HER2 immunohistochemical slides were reviewed and HER2 FISH results (available on 52 cases) were retrieved from pathology reports. HER2 immunohistochemical scores were assigned according to the FDA criteria and the current breast ASCO/CAP scoring criteria. Clinical information was retrieved from the patients' medical records. Thirty-eight cases (35%) showed HER2 overexpression and/or gene amplification, 20 of which (53%) had significant heterogeneity of protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Lack of apical membrane staining resulting in a lateral/basolateral staining pattern was observed in the majority of HER2-positive tumors. Five of the HER2-positive cases (13%) demonstrated discrepant immunohistochemical scores when using the FDA versus ASCO/CAP scoring system. The overall concordance rate between HER2 immunohistochemistry and FISH was 75% (39/52) when using the FDA criteria, compared with 81% (42/52) by the ASCO/CAP scoring system. In conclusion, in this largest comprehensive study, 35% of endometrial serous carcinoma harbors HER2 protein overexpression and/or gene amplification, over half of which demonstrate significant heterogeneity of protein expression. The current breast ASCO/CAP scoring criteria provide the highest concordance between immunohistochemistry and FISH. Assessment of HER2 immunohistochemistry on multiple tumor sections or sections with large tumor areas is recommended, due to the significant heterogeneity of HER2 protein expression.",

HER-2 gene amplification (ratio ≥ 2.2) by PRINS was found in 3:3, 6:21 and 0:3 in IHC 3+, 2+ and 1+/0 cases, respectively. Comparing FISH and IHC (immunohistochemistry), showed the same results as for PRINS and IHC. Chromosome 17 aneusomy was found in 10 of 21 IHC 2+ cases (47.6%), of which 1 (10%) showed hypodisomy (chromosome 17 copy number per cell ≤ 1.75), 7 (70%) showed low polysomy (chromosome 17 copy number per cell=2.26 - 3.75) and 2 (20%) showed high polysomy (chromosome 17 copy number per cell ≥ 3.76). The overall concordance of detection of HER-2 gene amplification by FISH and PRINS was 100% (27:27). Furthermore, both the level of HER-2 amplification and copy number of CEN17 analysis results correlated well between the two methods. In conclusion, PRINS is a reliable, reproducible technique and in our opinion can be used as an additional test to determine HER-2 status in breast tumours.",

The Task Force is a multidisciplinary panel of 24 experts in breast cancer representing the disciplines of medical oncology, pathology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, epidemiology, and patient advocacy. Invited members included members of the NCCN Breast Cancer Panel and other needed experts selected solely by the NCCN. During a 2-day meeting, individual task force members provided didactic presentations critically evaluating important aspects of HER2 biology and epidemiology: HER2 as a prognostic and predictive factor; results from clinical trials in which trastuzumab was used as a targeted therapy against HER2 in the adjuvant and metastatic settings; the available testing methodologies for HER2, including sensitivity, specificity, and ability to provide prognostic and predictive information; and the principles on which HER2 testing should be based. Each task force member was charged with identifying evidence relevant to their specific expertise and presentation. Following the presentations, an evidence-based consensus approach was used to formulate recommendations relating to the pathologic and clinical application of the evidence to breast cancer patient evaluation and care. In areas of controversy, this process extended beyond the meeting to achieve consensus. The Task Force concluded that accurate assignment of the HER2 status of invasive breast cancer is essential to clinical decision making in the treatment of breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. Formal validation and concordance testing should be performed and reported by laboratories performing HER2 testing for clinical purposes. If appropriate quality control/assurance procedures are in place, either immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods may be used. A tumor with an IHC score of 0 or 1+, an average HER2 gene/chromosome 17 ratio of less than 1.8, or an average number of HER2 gene copies/cell of 4 or less as determined by FISH is considered to be HER2 negative. A tumor with an IHC score of 3+, an average HER2 gene/chromosome 17 ratio of greater than 2.2 by FISH, or an average number of HER2 gene copies/cell of 6 or greater is considered HER2 positive. A tumor with an IHC score of 2+ should be further tested using FISH, with HER2 status determined by the FISH result. Tumor samples with an average HER2 gene/chromosome ratio of 1.8 to 2.2 or average number of HER2 gene copies/cell in the range of greater than 4 to less than 6 are considered to be borderline, and strategies to assign the HER2 status of such samples are proposed.",

Gene expression profiling has stratified breast cancers into distinct molecular subtypes: luminal, HER2 positive (HER2+), and basal-like. Recently, a novel claudin-low molecular subtype has been described. In this study, we correlated the expression patterns of claudins with the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. On the basis of immunohistochemical expression, 226 grade 3 invasive ductal carcinomas were stratified into 65 luminal (estrogen receptor positive (ER+)), 65 HER2+, 86 basal-like, including 14 metaplastic carcinomas (ER-, HER2-, CK5/6, and/or epidermal growth factor receptor positive), and 10 unclassified. Tissue microarrays were analyzed for the expression of claudins 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 by immunohistochemistry and scored semiquantitatively. High levels of expression were detected in 17% of all cases for claudin 1, 32% claudin 3, 41% claudin 4, 44% claudin 7, and 40% claudin 8. Luminal cancers exhibited increased claudins 7 and 8; basal-like tumors demonstrated increased expression of claudins 1 and 4. Low expression of all five claudins was detected in 30 of 226 cases (13%) and this group was designated 'claudin-low'. The majority of the claudin-low subgroup were basal-like cancers (23 of 30, 77%). In contrast, only 1 of 30 (3%) claudin-low tumors was of the luminal phenotype and 6 of 30 cases (20%) were HER2+ (P<0.001). Within the basal-like subgroup, 64% of the metaplastic and 19% of the non-metaplastic tumors were claudin-low. The claudin-low group was strongly associated with disease recurrence (P=0.0093). In conclusion, this study is the first to examine comprehensively the differential expression of claudins 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 in the molecular subtypes of high-grade breast cancer. Claudin-low subtype is a frequent phenomenon in metaplastic and basal-like breast cancer and appears to be a strong predictor of disease recurrence.",

Patients who had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancers; estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and HER2-negative (triple-negative) cancers; or basal-like cancers had a 2.18-fold, 2.33-fold, and 4.07-fold risk of dying of disease, respectively, compared with patients who had luminal A carcinomas. Unifocal luminal A, HER2-positive, and basal-like cancers were associated with significantly better long-term survival outcomes than their multifocal or diffuse counterparts; luminal B and triple-negative tumors also had the same tendency.

Here, we evaluated whether curcumin derivatives have better efficiency to degrade HER2 than curcumin. Among these test compounds, pculin02H had better efficiency to inhibit the expression of HER2 than curcumin. Moreover, pculin02H preferentially suppressed the growth of HER2-overexpressing cancer cell lines. Pculin02H induced G2/M cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Interestingly, our results suggested that a posttranslational mechanism contributed to pculin02H-induced HER2 depletion in HER2-overexpressing cancer cells.

Groups with and without basal protein expression were compared with respect to clinicopathologic parameters and survival. We treated 4 cell lines (2 basal-HER2 [HCC1569, HCC1954] and 2 nonbasal HER2 [BT474, SKBR3]) each with vehicle, T 20 μg/mL, paclitaxel 0.01 μM (P), and T with P (T + P). Cell viability was assessed and HER2 pathway suppression was compared between groups using immunoblot analysis. Mammosphere formation was used to assess breast cancer stem cell properties.;EGFR expression was significantly associated with cancer-specific survival (CSS) (P = .05). CK5/6 expression strongly correlated with overall and disease-free survival, and CSS (P = .03, P = .04, and P = .03, respectively). Statistical significance was maintained for EGFR and CK5/6 after adjustment for covariates. CK14 was not associated with survival. All cell lines expressed similar levels of HER2. T and P alone inhibited proliferation of nonbasal cell lines; T + P had an additive cytotoxic effect. Basal cells were resistant to T, P inhibited proliferation, but T + P had no additive cytotoxic effect on cell growth in basal cells. Immunoblot analysis showed a significant decrease in phosphorylated Akt levels after treatment with T or T + P in nonbasal cells but not in basal cells. Akt blockade suppressed growth of basal and nonbasal HER2(+) cells. Furthermore, basal HER2 cell lines had increased mammosphere formation, which suggests increased stem cell properties compared with nonbasal HER2 cell lines.;CK5/6 and EGFR expression are predictive of worse prognosis in HER2(+) breast cancer patients treated with T. Basal HER2 breast cancer cell lines are resistant to trastuzamab, which is mediated through the Akt pathway; AKT inhibition abrogates this resistance. Basal HER2 cell lines also have increased stem cell properties, which might play a role in the resistance pathway.",

We investigated the inhibitory effects of the Gemini vitamin D analog BXL0124, the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-Im and the combination on the tumorigenesis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. MMTV-ErbB2/neu transgenic mice were treated with BXL0124, CDDO-Im, or the combination from three months of age until the end of the experiment. Formation and growth of MMTV-ErbB2/neu mammary tumors were monitored every week, and all three treatments delayed the development of mammary tumors without significant toxicity. Decreased activation of ErbB2 as well as other ErbB receptors, ErbB1 and ErbB3, in MMTV-ErbB2/neu mammary tumors was shown by all treatments. Protein levels of downstream targets of the ErbB2 signaling pathway, including activated-Erk1/2, activated-Akt, c-Myc, CycD1, and Bcl2, were repressed by all three treatments, with the combination treatment exhibiting the strongest effects. To investigate therapeutic efficacy, the combination of BXL0124 and CDDO-Im was given to MMTV-ErbB2/neu mice after mammary tumors were established between 23 and 30 weeks of age. Short-term treatment with the combination did not show effects on tumor growth nor the ErbB2 signaling pathway. The present study shows BXL0124, CDDO-Im, and the combination as potential agents for prevention, but not treatment, against the tumorigenesis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer.",

Amplification of erbB2 is also associated with multiple genomic gains and losses; however, the importance of these associated changes is largely unknown. We demonstrate that Brk, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, is coamplified and coexpressed with ErbB2 in human breast cancers. ErbB2 interacts with Brk and increases its intrinsic kinase activity. Expression of Brk enhances the ErbB2-induced activation of Ras/MAPK signaling and cyclin E/cdk2 activity to induce cell proliferation of mammary 3-dimensional acini in culture. In a murine model of breast cancer, expression of Brk was found to shorten the latency of ErbB2-induced tumors by promoting cell proliferation, with no effect on protection from apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of Brk conferred resistance to the ability of Lapatinib, an ErbB2 kinase inhibitor, to inhibit ErbB2-induced proliferation. Thus, we identified Brk as a drug target for ErbB2-positive cancers.",

We have now done validation experiments on a group of three cell membrane components that had previously not been implicated in breast cancer. We also studied the expression of three other cell membrane proteins known to play a role in mammary neoplasia.;By immunohistochemistry, we examined up to 130 archival breast carcinomas for Celsr2, E-cadherin, Kai1, and CD9 expression. The expression levels of NET-6 and TROP-2 were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in a subset of frozen tumors. We also studied fresh pellets and paraffin-embedded cell buttons of nine human breast cell lines. The relationship between the expression of all six membrane proteins and a variety of pathologic and biological variables, including estrogen receptor, HER2, and epidermal growth factor receptor status, was also examined. The NET-6 gene was transfected into a low-expressing cell line, and the effect on cellular morphology, growth, and invasion in vitro was recorded.;Celsr2 was down-regulated in one cell line and in 7% of breast cancers. E-cadherin, Kai1, and CD9 were down-regulated in 35%, 76%, and 79% of tumors, respectively, confirming the important role of these markers in human mammary neoplasia. In breast cancer cell lines and tissues, TROP-2 was generally expressed at low levels, although a few specimens showed relative overexpression. NET-6 levels were lower in HER2-negative breast carcinoma cells. In addition, NET-6 was markedly down-regulated in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers, and expression was lowest in \"basal-like\" tumors. Ectopic expression of NET-6 in low-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells altered cellular morphology, inhibited growth in vitro, and decreased invasion in a Boyden chamber assay.;We have confirmed the expression of three new membrane markers that had previously not been implicated in human breast cancer, and one of them (NET-6) was correlated with HER2 and estrogen receptor status. NET-6 levels were decreased in estrogen receptor-negative and high-grade tumors, and ectopic expression of this gene had an inhibitory effect on proliferation and invasion.

Next, we performed the staining for EGFR and two patterns of the final product of reaction were described.

A significant correlation was found between EGFR expression and degree of differentiation and distant metastasis. No significant correlation was found with the lymph node status, excepting for the basal-like carcinoma in which an inverse correlation was noticed.

We recently hypothesized that the anti-cancer actions of olive oil may relate to its monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) oleic acid (OA; 18:1n-9) content to specifically regulate oncogenes. In this study, transient transfection experiments with human Her-2/neu promoter-driven luciferase gene established the ability of OA to specifically repress the transcriptional activity of Her-2/neu gene. Gene repression was seen in tumour-derived cell lines with Her-2/neu gene amplification and overexpression, including SK-Br3 (56% reduction), SK-OV3 (75% reduction) and NCI-N87 (55% reduction) breast, ovarian and stomach cancer cell lines, respectively. Also marginal decreases in promoter activity were observed in cancer cells expressing physiological levels of Her-2/neu (20% reduction in MCF-7 breast cancer cells). Remarkably, OA treatment in Her-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells was found to induce up-regulation of the Ets protein polyomavirus enhancer activator 3 (PEA3), a transcriptional repressor of Her-2/neu promoter. Also, an intact PEA3 DNA-binding-site at endogenous Her-2/neu gene promoter was essential for OA-induced repression of this gene. Moreover, OA treatment failed to decrease Her-2/neu protein levels in MCF-7/Her2-18 transfectants, which stably express full-length human Her-2/neu cDNA controlled by a SV40 viral promoter. OA-induced transcriptional repression of Her-2/neu through the action of PEA3 protein at the promoter level may represent a novel mechanism linking \"Mediterranean diet\" and cancer.",

Unfortunately, resistance frequently occurs and is often related with overexpression of the membrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER2. This is the rationale behind combined treatments with endocrine therapy and novel inhibitors that reduce HER2 expression and signaling and thus inhibit Tam-resistant breast cancer cell growth. In this study, we show that activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), by the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or the synthetic agonist GW4064, inhibited growth of Tam-resistant breast cancer cells (termed MCF-7 TR1), which was used as an in vitro model of acquired Tam resistance. Our results demonstrate that CDCA treatment significantly reduced both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced growth in MCF-7 TR1 cells. Furthermore, results from western blot analysis and real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed that CDCA treatment reduced HER2 expression and inhibited EGF-mediated HER2 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in these Tam-resistant breast cancer cells. Transient transfection experiments, using a vector containing the human HER2 promoter region, showed that CDCA treatment downregulated basal HER2 promoter activity. This occurred through an inhibition of nuclear factor-κB transcription factor binding to its specific responsive element located in the HER2 promoter region as revealed by mutagenesis studies, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Collectively, these data suggest that FXR ligand-dependent activity, blocking HER2/MAPK signaling, may overcome anti-estrogen resistance in human breast cancer cells and could represent a new therapeutic tool to treat breast cancer patients that develop resistance.",

We recently developed a method for establishing serially transplantable, phenotypically stable, human breast cancer xenograft models in immunocompromised mice with comparatively high efficiency (overall ∼25%). These xenografts represent the major clinically defined subtypes of breast cancer [e.g. estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 positive (HER2+), and \"triple negative\" (TN) breast cancers].

Furthermore, the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor appears to have a low incidence of cardiotoxicity, and may decrease the rate of later brain metastases. Therefore, several cooperative groups and academic centers have initiated trials investigating lapatinib in the treatment of early-stage ErbB2 (HER2)-overexpressing breast cancer.",

NGAL is expressed in a variety of tumor types including breast carcinomas, but it is not known whether NGAL contributes directly to breast cancer progression. This study examines the relationship between NGAL expression in breast carcinomas and established clinical prognostic markers as well as clinical outcome. Using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing well characterized tumor samples from 207 breast cancer patients, NGAL was detected in 68 breast carcinomas in a cytoplasmic location. NGAL expression correlated strongly with negative steroid receptor status, HER-2/neu overexpression, poor histologic grade, the presence of lymph node metastases and a high Ki-67 proliferation index. In univariate survival analysis, NGAL expression was associated with decreased disease-specific survival and decreased disease-free survival in the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis, NGAL remained an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival. In a subset of patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors, NGAL was significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival. The results show that NGAL expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in primary human breast cancer and suggest that NGAL detection may provide information for risk assessment and identify a subset of patients requiring more aggressive adjuvant therapy.",

Amplification of the HER2 gene and overexpression of its product induce cell transformation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the prognostic relevance of p185(HER2), which is overexpressed in 10% to 40% of human breast tumors. Recent data suggest that p185(HER2) is a ligand orphan receptor that amplifies the signal provided by other receptors of the HER family by heterodimerizing with them. Ligand-dependent activation of HER1, HER3, and HER4 by EGF or heregulin results in heterodimerization and, thereby, HER2 activation. HER2 overexpression is associated with breast cancer patient responsiveness to doxorubicin, to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), and to paclitaxel, whereas tamoxifen was found to be ineffective and even detrimental in patients with HER2-positive tumors. In vitro analyses have shown that the role of HER2 overexpression in determining the sensitivity of cancer cells to drugs is complex, and molecules involved in its signaling pathway are probably the actual protagonists of the sensitivity to drugs. The association of HER2 overexpression with human tumors, its extracellular accessibility, as well as its involvement in tumor aggressiveness are all factors that make this receptor an appropriate target for tumor-specific therapies. A number of approaches are being investigated as possible therapeutic strategies that target HER2: (1) growth inhibitory antibodies, which can be used alone or in combination with standard chemotherapeutics; (2) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), which have been developed in an effort to block receptor activity because phosphorylation is the key event leading to activation and initiation of the signaling pathway; and (3) active immunotherapy, because the HER2 oncoprotein is immunogenic in some breast carcinoma patients.",

Chromogranin A and synaptophysin have been considered as the most sensitive and specific neuroendocrine markers in NEBC. At the molecular level, recent gene expression profiling studies have shown that NEBCs pertain to the luminal molecular type, being positive for hormone receptors and negative for HER2. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that mucinous and neuroendocrine carcinomas are transcriptionally distinct from conventional invasive ductal carcinomas. Following the above criteria, NEBCs constitute approximately 1% of all breast carcinomas.

Tumor DNA was employed to evaluate two quantitative PCR methods: the HER2/neu DNA Quantification Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany), which uses the gastrin chromosome 17 reference gene, and our recently developed Oncolab qPCR assay, where both a chromosome 17 gene (somatostatin receptor type II (SSTR2)) and a non-chromosome 17 reference gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate deshydrogenase (GAPDH)) were used to detect an increase in HER2 gene copy number and to evaluate the aneusomy of chromosome 17, respectively. By IHC/FISH and ELISA, HER2 was overexpressed in 27 (16.6%) and 24 (14.7%) samples, respectively. With the Roche and Oncolab qPCR assays, 29 (17.8%) samples showed a ratio of HER2/gastrin > or = 2.0 and 26 (16.0%) showed a ratio of HER2/SSTR2 > or = 2.0, respectively. In samples presenting HER2/SSTR2 <2.0 and HER2/GAPDH > or = 2.0, which was indicative of a chromosome 17 polysomy, we observed a modest increase in HER2 protein expression.

S100A4 mRNA is present in some cell lines derived from malignant breast cancers, but is not detectable in cells derived from benign breast tumours. In human tumour specimens, using in situ hybridisation, the mRNA for S100A4 is localised to the epithelial cells of carcinoma specimens, and in some normal breast specimens, to a stromal region surrounding the epithelial ducts. In carcinoma specimens, S100A4 mRNA is also found in the stromal region surrounding islands of cancer cells. For both the epithelial and stromal components, S100A4 mRNA is present at a higher level in carcinomas relative to benign breast tumour specimens. In general, there is a concordance between the S100A4 mRNA signal from the epithelial and stromal elements of the same carcinoma specimens.

We conducted a population-based nested case-control study among women 20-74 years of age diagnosed with a first breast cancer between 1996 and 2008 in western Washington State to evaluate the association between their tumor's estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2-neu (HER2) expression, and risk of CBC. The study included 482 cases diagnosed with both a FBC and a CBC and 1,506 control women diagnosed only once with breast cancer identified through our local Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry. Compared to the women whose FBC was ER+/PR+, those with ER-/PR- first tumors had a 1.6-fold (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.2-2.3) increased risk of developing a CBC. When evaluated by joint ER/PR/HER2 status, compared to women with ER+/HER2- first cancers, those with HER2-overexpressing (ER-/HER2+) and triple-negative disease (ER-/PR-/HER2-) had 2.0-fold (95 % CI: 1.1-3.8) and 1.4-fold (95 % CI: 0.9-2.3) elevated risks of developing CBC, respectively. Beyond the known higher risks of mortality among patients diagnosed with more aggressive BC subtypes, here, we observe that they may also have increased risks of developing CBC.",

Cases were classified as luminal A (ER and/or PR positive and HER2 negative, Ki-67 < 14%), luminal B (ER and/or PR positive, HER2 negative, and Ki-67 > 14%), triple-positive (ER and/or PR positive and HER2 positive), HER2-enriched (ER and PR negative, and HER2- positive), and triple-negative (TN) (ER negative, PR negative, and HER2- negative). Comparisons of the ages of patients and molecular subtypes between different geographic regions were performed.;South and Southeast regions with a higher percentage of European ancestry and higher socioeconomic status presented with the highest proportion of luminal tumors. The North region presented with more aggressive subtypes (HER2-enriched and triple-negative), while the Central-West region predominated triple-positive carcinomas. The Northeast--a region with a high African influence--presented intermediate frequency of the different molecular subtypes. The differences persisted in subgroups of patients under and over 50 years.;The geographic regions differ according to the distribution of molecular subtypes of breast cancer. However, other differences, beside those related to African ancestry, such as socioeconomic, climatic, nutritional, and geographic, have to be considered to explain our results.

A lack of understanding in DCIS pathobiology has led to overtreatment of more than half of patients. We profiled the temporal molecular changes during DCIS transition to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) using in vivo DCIS progression models. These studies identified B cell lymphoma-9 (BCL9) as a potential molecular driver of early invasion. BCL9 is a newly found co-activator of Wnt-stimulated β-catenin-mediated transcription. BCL9 has been shown to promote progression of multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma. However BCL9 role in breast cancer had not been previously recognized.;Microarray and RNA sequencing were utilized to characterize the sequential changes in mRNA expression during DCIS invasive transition. BCL9-shRNA knockdown was performed to assess the role of BCL9 in in vivo invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and canonical Wnt-signaling. Immunofluorescence of 28 patient samples was used to assess a correlation between the expression of BCL9 and biomarkers of high risk DCIS. The cancer genome atlas data were analyzed to assess the status of BCL9 gene alterations in breast cancers.;Analysis of BCL9, by RNA and protein showed BCL9 up-regulation to be associated with DCIS transition to IDC. Analysis of patient DCIS revealed a significant correlation between high nuclear BCL9 and pathologic characteristics associated with DCIS recurrence: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative, high nuclear grade, and high human epidermal growth factor receptor2 (HER2). In vivo silencing of BCL9 resulted in the inhibition of DCIS invasion and reversal of EMT. Analysis of the TCGA data showed BCL9 to be altered in 26 % of breast cancers. This is a significant alteration when compared to HER2 (ERBB2) gene (19 %) and estrogen receptor (ESR1) gene (8 %). A significantly higher proportion of basal like invasive breast cancers compared to luminal breast cancers showed BCL9 amplification.;BCL9 is a molecular driver of DCIS invasive progression and may predispose to the development of basal like invasive breast cancers. As such, BCL9 has the potential to serve as a biomarker of high risk DCIS and as a therapeutic target for prevention of IDC.",

Recent excitement has surrounded the therapeutic effects of HER-2-blocking therapy strategies and has rekindled interest on the molecular mechanisms of HER-2/neu in tumor biology. To study the role of HER-2/neu overexpression in vivo, we used a murine fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3-her2) conditionally expressing human HER-2/neu under control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter. Expression of HER-2 could be down-regulated below detection limit (>625-fold dilution) by exposure of NIH3T3-her2 cells to anhydrotetracycline (ATc). Subcutaneous injection of NIH3T3-her2 cells into nude mice resulted in rapid tumor growth. Mice with mean tumor volumes of 0.2, 0.8, 1.9, and 14.9 cm(3) were treated daily with 10 mg/kg ATc to switch off HER-2/neu expression, producing reductions in tumor size of 100, 98.1, 81.4, and 74.2%, respectively, by 7 days after onset of ATc administration (P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis test). Different long-term effects of HER-2 down-regulation were observed when mice with small (0.2 cm(3); n = 7), intermediate (0.8-1.2 cm(3); n = 10) and large (> or =1.9 cm(3); n = 11) tumors received ATc for up to 40 days. Complete remission was observed for 100, 40, and 18% of the small-, intermediate-, and large-sized tumors, respectively (P = 0.003). However, after 20-45 days of ATc administration, recurrent tumor growth was observed for all mice, even in those with previous complete remissions. The time periods for which mean tumor volume could be suppressed to volumes <0.1 cm(3) under ATc administration were 34, 22, 8, and 0 days for tumors with initial volumes of 0.2, 0.8, 1.9 and 14.9 cm(3), respectively (P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis test). Interestingly, HER-2 remained below the detection limit in recurrent tumor tissue, suggesting that initially HER-2-dependent tumors switched to HER-2 independence. The \"second hits\" leading to HER-2-independent tumor growth have not yet been identified. The rapid regression of tumors after down-regulation of HER-2 was explained by two independent mechanisms: (a) a block in cell cycle progression, as evidenced by a decrease in Ki-67 antigen expression from 40% before ATc treatment to 8.3% after 7 days of ATc treatment; and (b) induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by caspase-3 activation and by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Tdt)-mediated nick end labeling assay (TUNEL). In conclusion, we have shown that switching off HER-2 may disturb the sensitive balance between cell proliferation and cell death, leading to apoptosis and tumor remission. Tumor remission was dependent on the volume of the tumors before down-regulation of HER-2/neu.",

The aims of this study were to estimate the frequency of spatial heterogeneity in biomarker expression within tumors, to identify technical and biological factors contributing to spatial heterogeneity, and to examine the impact of discordant biomarker status within tumors on clinical record agreement.;Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed using two to four cores (1.0 mm) for each of 1085 invasive breast cancers from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, which is part of the AMBER Consortium. Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was quantified using automated digital imaging analysis. The biomarker status for each core and for each case was assigned using clinical thresholds. Cases with core-to-core biomarker discordance were manually reviewed to distinguish intratumoral biomarker heterogeneity from misclassification of biomarker status by the automated algorithm. The impact of core-to-core biomarker discordance on case-level agreement between TMAs and the clinical record was evaluated.;On the basis of automated analysis, discordant biomarker status between TMA cores occurred in 9 %, 16 %, and 18 % of cases for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively. Misclassification of benign epithelium and/or ductal carcinoma in situ as invasive carcinoma by the automated algorithm was implicated in discordance among cores. However, manual review of discordant cases confirmed spatial heterogeneity as a source of discordant biomarker status between cores in 2 %, 7 %, and 8 % of cases for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively. Overall, agreement between TMA and clinical record was high for ER (94 %), PR (89 %), and HER2 (88 %), but it was reduced in cases with core-to-core discordance (agreement 70 % for ER, 61 % for PR, and 57 % for HER2).;Intratumoral biomarker heterogeneity may impact breast cancer classification accuracy, with implications for clinical management. Both manually confirmed biomarker heterogeneity and misclassification of biomarker status by automated image analysis contribute to discordant biomarker status between TMA cores. Given that manually confirmed heterogeneity is uncommon (<10 % of cases), large studies are needed to study the impact of heterogeneous biomarker expression on breast cancer classification and outcomes.",

The HER2/neu expression status determines whether or not patient will receive trastuzumab-based treatment. In clinical practice, over-expression of HER2/neu is routinely identified using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) or Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH), both of which are invasive approaches requiring tissue samples. Serum assays for the Extra Cellular Domain of HER2/neu receptor (HER2 ECD) have been reported but the use is very limited due to serum interference factors (e.g. human anti-animal immunoglobulin antibodies) that lead to false test results and inconsistency with tissue Her2 status. We have developed an ELISA based approach using an MBB buffer to eliminate false results and to obtain more accurate assessment of HER2 ECD levels. Using this refined assay we retroactively measured HER2/neu levels from breast cancer patients and controls. Abnormal HER2 ECD levels were detected in about 32% of invasive breast cancer patients but not in controls or patients with benign diseases. In addition, we also showed that patients with elevated serum HER2 levels appeared to have worse survival regardless of treatments. In a small group of 12 Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients who received HER2/neu peptide vaccination and surgery, only one patient showed constantly rising HER2 levels after treatment and this patient had recurrence of HER2 positive tumor within 5 years. Our studies indicate that once the serum interference issue is resolved, serum HER2 ECD can have potential clinical utility to supplement the tissue based tests.",

The results of this study demonstrate that while carbamazepine had no effect on the Her-2 mRNA level, it induced Her-2 protein degradation via the proteasome pathway by disrupting the chaperone function of Hsp90 in SK-BR-3 cells. Mechanistically, carbamazepine could enhance the acetylation of α-tubulin, indicating its inhibitory effect on HDAC6. Functionally, carbamazepine could synergize with trastuzumab or geldanamycin to promote Her-2 degradation and inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation.

Over 200,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the USA, with approximately 40,000 of these cases resulting in death. HER2-positive (HER2+) breast tumors, representing 20-30 % of early-stage breast cancer diagnoses, are characterized by the amplification of the HER2 gene. However, the critical genes and pathways that become affected by HER2 amplification in humans are yet to be specifically identified. Furthermore, it is yet to be determined if HER2 amplification also affects the expression of long intervening non-coding (linc)RNAs, which are involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We examined changes in gene expression by next generation RNA sequencing in human tumors pre- and post- HER2 inhibition by trastuzumab in vivo, and changes in gene expression in response to HER2 knock down in cell culture models. We integrated our results with gene expression analysis of HER2+ tumors vs matched normal tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The integrative analyses of these datasets led to the identification of a small set of mRNAs, and the associated biological pathways that become deregulated by HER2 amplification. Furthermore, our analyses identified three lincRNAs that become deregulated in response to HER2 amplification both in vitro and in vivo. Our results should provide the foundation for functional studies of these candidate mRNAs and lincRNAs to further our understanding of how HER2 amplification results in tumorigenesis. Also, the identified lincRNAs could potentially open the door for future RNA-based biomarkers and therapeutics in HER2+ breast cancer. ",

The aptamer also bound to the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2 protein with a Kdof 316 nM, and had minimal cross reactivity to albumin or trypsin. In addition, the aptamer was found to preferentially bind to HER2-positive but not HER2-negative breast cancer cells. An aptamer-doxorubicin complex (Apt-Dox) was formulated by intercalating Dox into the DNA structure of HB5. The Apt-Dox complex could selectively deliver Dox to HER2-positive breast cancer cells while reducing the drug intake by HER2-negative cells in vitro. Moreover, Apt-Dox retained the cytotoxicity of Dox against HER2-positive breast cancer cells, but reduced the cytotoxicity to HER2-negative cells.;The results suggest that the selected HER2 aptamer may have application potentials in targeted therapy against HER2-positive breast cancer cells.",

Previously, we have shown that deletion of TβRII in mammary epithelial of MMTV-PyMT mice results in shortened tumor latency and increased lung metastases. However, active TGFβ signaling increased the number of circulating tumor cells and metastases in MMTV-Neu mice. In the current study, we describe a newly discovered connection between attenuated TGFβ signaling and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling in mammary tumor progression.;All studies were performed on MMTV-Neu mice with and without dominant-negative TβRII (DNIIR) in mammary epithelium. Mammary tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. The levels of secreted proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Whole-lung mount staining was used to quantitate lung metastasis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were used to determine the relevance of our findings to human breast cancer.;Attenuated TGFβ signaling led to a delay tumor onset, but increased the number of metastases in MMTVNeu/DNIIR mice. The DNIIR tumors were characterized by increased vasculogenesis, vessel leakage, and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). During DNIIR tumor progression, both the levels of CXCL1/5 and the number of CD11b+Gr1+ cells and T cells decreased. Analysis of TCGA datasets demonstrated a significant negative correlation between TGFBR2 and VEGF genes expression. Higher VEGFA expression correlated with shorter distant metastasis-free survival only in HER2+ patients with no differences in HER2-, estrogen receptor +/- or progesterone receptor +/- breast cancer patients.;Our studies provide insights into a novel mechanism by which epithelial TGFβ signaling modulates the tumor microenvironment, and by which it is involved in lung metastasis in HER2+ breast cancer patients. The effects of pharmacological targeting of the TGFβ pathway in vivo during tumor progression remain controversial. The targeting of TGFβ signaling should be a viable option, but because VEGF has a protumorigenic effect on HER2+ tumors, the targeting of this protein could be considered when it is associated with attenuated TGFβ signaling.",

Among the recently described molecular and phenotypic classes of breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumours are associated with a poor prognosis. HER2 plays an important role in cancer progression being targeted to provide predictive and prognostic information. Moreover, HER2 is related to cancer resistance against a variety of therapies; however, trastuzumab (herceptin) has proved successful in treatment of this subgroup. Nevertheless, resistance to this drug may be acquired by patients after a period of treatment, which indicates that other molecular mechanisms might influence success of this therapy. Dimerization between members of the HER family may contribute to resistance against treatments due to different combinations that trigger different downstream pathways. This is promoted by ligands, which are expressed as transmembrane precursor protein molecules and have a conserved epidermal growth factor-like domain. Through resistance to trastuzumab, other drugs are being developed to interact in different domains of HER2 protein. It might be a good strategy to apply new drugs simultaneously to trastuzumab due to act in different domains of HER2. The study of interaction between receptors/ligands will characterize specifically their signalling pathway and understand which strategy to acquire.",

Luminal B tumors have higher proliferation and poorer prognosis than luminal A tumors. In this study, we developed a clinically practical immunohistochemistry assay to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors and investigated its ability to separate tumors according to breast cancer recurrence-free and disease-specific survival.;Tumors from a cohort of 357 patients with invasive breast carcinomas were subtyped by gene expression profile. Hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and the Ki67 index (percentage of Ki67-positive cancer nuclei) were determined immunohistochemically. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the Ki67 cut point to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors. The prognostic value of the immunohistochemical assignment for breast cancer recurrence-free and disease-specific survival was investigated with an independent tissue microarray series of 4046 breast cancers by use of Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression.;Gene expression profiling classified 101 (28%) of the 357 tumors as luminal A and 69 (19%) as luminal B. The best Ki67 index cut point to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors was 13.25%. In an independent cohort of 4046 patients with breast cancer, 2847 had hormone receptor-positive tumors. When HER2 immunohistochemistry and the Ki67 index were used to subtype these 2847 tumors, we classified 1530 (59%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 57% to 61%) as luminal A, 846 (33%, 95% CI = 31% to 34%) as luminal B, and 222 (9%, 95% CI = 7% to 10%) as luminal-HER2 positive.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the most widely applicable diagnostic modality in studying HER-2 status. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is also recognized as a modality in cases with an equivocal IHC status (score, 2+). Some authors claimed that FISH alone is sufficient. The aim of this study was to correlate the test results of IHC and FISH for HER-2 gene amplification in breast cancer patients. FISH for topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) was also studied to see if deletion or amplification of TOP2A has any supplementary role to HER-2, FISH and IHC.;Assessment of HER-2 gene amplification and TOP2A gene amplification/deletion was made by FISH analysis using the LSI TOP2A/HER-2/CEP 17 multicolor probe or the LSI HER-2/CEP dual color probe (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL, USA) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 54 breast cancer patients who were grouped into stages 1+, 2+ or 3+ based on IHC (HercepTest; DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA) observations.;None of IHC 1+ breast tumors was HER-2 FISH positive, but three of 18 (17%) IHC 3+ tumors were HER-2 FISH negative. Overall, 53% of the IHC 2+ and 83% of the IHC 3+ cases were HER-2 FISH positive. Only one case with IHC 3+ tumor that was HER-2 FISH positive was found to have TOP2A amplification (>2.0) and no IHC 2+ cases were found to have TOP2A amplification. There were no cases with TOP2A deletion (<0.8) in our whole series. There were also no cases of HER-2 FISH negative tumors, but IHC scored as 2+ or 3+ (0 of 10), to be found with TOP2A amplification. The discordance rates by IHC were high (46.7% in IHC 2+, 16.7% in IHC 3+, 30.3% overall in IHC 2+ or 3+). On the contrary, the discordance rates were zero if by FISH.;The current algorithm to use HER-2 FISH as a supplementary role to IHC HercepTest 2+ may need some modifications according to the local setting.

The objective of the present study was to investigate a putative role for PAX2 in the control of luminal breast cancer cells invasion, and to begin to characterize its regulation.;PAX2 activity was higher in cell lines from luminal compared to non-luminal subtype, and activation of PAX2 by estradiol was selectively achieved in breast cancer cell lines of the luminal subtype. This process was blocked by ICI 182780 and could be antagonized by IGF-1. Knockdown of PAX2 in luminal MCF-7 cells completely abrogated estradiol-induced downregulation of ERBB2 and decrease of cell invasion, whereas overexpression of PAX2 in these cells enhanced estradiol effects on ERBB2 levels and cell invasion.;The study demonstrates that PAX2 activation by estradiol is selectively achieved in breast cancer cells of the luminal subtype, via ERα, and identifies IGF-1 as a negative regulator of PAX2 activity in these cells.

We also investigated the relative expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in IDC and normal breast tissues by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry.;Transfection experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in SKBr3 cells indicated that MBP-1 negatively regulates the ERBB2 gene by binding to a genomic region between nucleotide -514 and -262 of the proximal promoter; consistent with this, a concomitant recruitment of HDAC1 and loss of acetylated histone H4 was observed. In addition, we found high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in normal tissues and a statistically significant inverse correlation with ErbB2 expression in the paired tumor samples.;Altogether, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the ERBB2 gene is a novel MBP-1 target, and immunohistochemistry analysis of primary tumors suggests that the concomitant high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 may be considered a diagnostic marker of cancer progression for breast IDC.",
