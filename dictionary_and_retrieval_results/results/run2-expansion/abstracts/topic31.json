We analyzed the alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a) and p53 to study the contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis of 29 patients with primary and consecutive (second primary) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), with a total of 68 carcinomas.;After microdissection, the DNA of 29 primary and 39 consecutive squamous cell carcinomas was analyzed for INK4a-ARF inactivation and p53 mutation by means of DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), restriction-enzyme-related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), multiplex RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletions of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) were assessed using differential PCR.;Altogether inactivation (methylation, loss of heterozygosity and mutation of exon 1beta) of p14(ARF) was found in 29 of all 68 (43%) carcinomas, with a significant difference in primary [8 of 29 (28%)] relative to second primary carcinomas [21 of 39 (54%)]. Methylation of p16(INK4a) occurred in 22 of 68 (32%) carcinomas with an even distribution among primary and consecutive tumors. Only two (secondary) carcinomas showed simultaneous promoter methylation of p14(ARF) and p16 (INK4a). Mutations of p53 were found in 32 of 68 HNSCCs (44%), evenly distributed among primary and recurrent carcinomas. p14(ARF) alterations showed no relationship to p53 mutations.;Our data indicate that the INK4a-ARF-/p53 pathway was disrupted in 58 of 68 (84%) primary and recurrent tumors, either by p53 mutations or by INK4a-ARF inactivation. p14(ARF) methylation occurred independently of p16(INK4a) alterations and showed no correlation to p53 mutations. The significantly higher rate of p14(ARF) alterations in recurrent (respective second primary) carcinomas suggests a further acquired genetic aberration during the development of the recurrent carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"To understand the association of candidate tumour suppressor genes SH3GL2, p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), and p15(INK4b) in the pathogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we studied the deletion, mutation, and methylation of these genes in 61 dysplastic lesions and 94 HNSCC samples. In mild dysplasia, SH3GL2, p16(INK4a), and p14(ARF) showed a higher frequency of overall alterations (60-70%) than in p15(INK4b) (40%). However, in subsequent stages of tumour progression, the alteration frequency of these genes did not change significantly. One novel mutation in common exon 2 of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and three in exon 9 of SH3GL2 were seen. Concordance was seen in the expression of these genes with their molecular alterations. Deletions of INK4A-ARF and p15(INK4b) have a significant poor patient outcome. The alterations of p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), and p15(INK4b) were positively correlated with tobacco and inversely with HPV, while SH3GL2 alterations were independent of these factors. Based on aetiological factors, four tumour subtypes were recognized: HPV(-)tobacco(-) (I), HPV(+)tobacco(-) (II), HPV(-)tobacco(+) (III), and HPV(+)tobacco(+) (IV). Groups III and IV showed a high frequency of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF)/p15(INK4b) alterations with significant poor patient outcome in comparison to group II. Our findings suggest that deregulation of SH3GL2-associated signalling and p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF)/p15(INK4b)-mediated G1-S/G2-M checkpoints of cell cycle are independent pathways for the development of early dysplastic lesions of the head and neck.",

        "Doc_abstract":"p16(INK4a) immunohistochemical overexpression is an overall reliable surrogate marker of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). However, cases of ambiguous p16(INK4a) overexpression are regularly detected in the head and neck: p16(INK4a) expression can be observed in non-malignant tissue, such as tonsillar crypt epithelium and a proportion of branchial cleft cysts. Additionally, diverse patterns of p16(INK4) expression can complicate interpretation of \"p16(INK4a) -positivity\". These aspects impede the unrestricted application of p16(INK4a) as a diagnostic marker in the head and neck. We hypothesized that combined detection of p16(INK4a) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 could support clarification of ambiguous p16(INK4a) expression in the head and neck by specifically indicating p16(INK4a) -expressing cells with proliferative activity. p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression in a combined staining procedure was correlated to distinct p16(INK4a) expression patterns and HPV status (HPV DNA followed by E6*I oncogene mRNA detection) in 147 HNSCC and 50 non-malignant head and neck samples. p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression only occurred in transformed cells of the head and neck. Co-expression was never detected in non-transformed cells. Combined p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 expression was stringently associated with a diffuse p16(INK4a) expression pattern. All HPV oncogene-expressing HNSCC showed p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression. We demonstrate that p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression occurs exclusively in transformed cells of the head and neck. Our findings indicate a substantial impact of combined p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 expression in the assessment of ambiguous p16(INK4a) expression in the head and neck by specifically identifying p16(INK4a) -expressing cells with proliferative activity. This property will be of considerable significance for head and neck histo- and cytopathology. ",

Still, the cell cycle-regulatory genes p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) remain poorly understood in oral cavity premalignant lesions. This study evaluated INK4a/ARF locus alterations in 26 patients (28 samples) deemed to be at increased risk for malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma due to the diagnosis of severe oral epithelial dysplasia. Microscopically confirmed dysplastic oral epithelium and matching normal tissue were laser capture-microdissected from paraffin sections, DNA was isolated, and molecular techniques were used to evaluate p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) gene deletion, mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and hypermethylation events. Deletion of exon 1beta, 1alpha, or 2 was detected in 3.8%, 11.5%, and 7.7% of patients, respectively. INK4a and ARF mutations were detected in 15.4% and 11.5% of patients with severe dysplasia of the oral epithelium. All identified mutations occurred in the INK4a/ARF conserved exon 2. Allelic imbalance was assessed using three markers previously reported to show high LOH rates in head and neck tumors. LOH was found in 42.1%, 35.0%, and 82.4% of patients for the markers IFNalpha, D9S1748, and D9S171, respectively. Hypermethylation of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) was detected in 57.7% and 3.8% of patients, respectively, using nested, two-stage methylation-specific PCR. The highest rates of p16(INK4a) hypermethylation occurred in lesions of the tongue and floor of the mouth. In addition, p16(INK4a) hypermethylation was significantly linked to LOH in two or more markers. These data support that INK4a/ARF locus alterations are frequent events preceding the development of oral cancer and that p16(INK4a) inactivation occurs to a greater extent in oral dysplasia than does p14(ARF) inactivation.",

The objective of this study was to use different methods for the analysis of the incidence of changes at the INK4a locus in head and neck cancer (HNSCC). Primary tumours were analysed for allelic imbalances (AI) with microsatellite markers for chromosome 9, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and IHC with enhanced sensitivity by tyramide signal amplification (TSA-IHC), and by RT-PCR. No homozygous deletions at 9p21 were detected. AI at 9p21, which was found in approximately 60% of the tumours, completely failed to indicate the functional inactivation of the two INK4a gene products. Immunostaining of normal squamous epithelia revealed very low levels of p16(INK4a), whereas p14(ARF) was readily detectable. In 160 tumours, IHC suggested a loss of p16(INK4a) expression in 90%. However, by TSA-IHC, only 53.7% showed loss of p16(INK4a) expression, and this was consistent with the RT-PCR analyses. In 100 tumours analysed for both proteins, selective loss of p16(INK4a) occurred in 37%; loss of p14(ARF) was found in only 15%, and selective loss in only 4%; 11% of the tumours had lost both proteins. We conclude that only IHC with high sensitivity and the combined expression analysis of mRNAs and proteins is suitable for studying the role of INK4a in HNSCC. The INK4a gene expression defects are frequent but not universal and primarily affect p16(INK4a). Their clinical impact is still not clear.",

Deletions and mutations involving INK4a occur frequently in cancers, implying that p16INK4a, like pRB, suppresses tumor formation. An unrelated protein (p19ARF) arises in major part from an alternative reading frame of the mouse INK4a gene, and its ectopic expression in the nucleus of rodent fibroblasts induces G1 and G2 phase arrest.

Twelve of the 44 HCCs (27.2%) showed immunohistochemical evidence of p53 alteration; however, only 1 of the tumors with p53 alteration was well differentiated. TaqMan polymarase chain reaction (PCR) indicated that the expression of p14(ARF) in HCCs was higher than in that in all but three of the corresponding non-tumorous tissues ( P < 0.0001), and increased expression of p14(ARF) seemed to be associated with poorly differentiated phenotype.

Subcellular localization studies showed a predominant nuclear localization of cdk6, demonstrating that this kinase was biologically active. The molecular basis for this aberration are mutations in the MTS1 locus of chromosome 9p21. This locus encodes two partially overlapping genes, the cdk inhibitor p16(ink4a), and p14(ARF), an inhibitor of mdm2-mediated degradation of p53.

No clear association of p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), and MTAP expression in plaque tissue with Chr9p21 haplotypes was found. The latter finding was corroborated by the lack of correlation of RNA expression of 9p21-regulated transcripts EU741058 and NR_003529 of antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) with mRNA expression of these genes.

Our detailed examination of 40 cutaneous SCC revealed loss of heterozygosity of 9p21 markers in 32.5% of cases. Mutational analysis confirmed five point mutations in four of 40 SCCs. These mutations changed the amino acid sequence of p16(INK4a) in four tumors and p14(ARF) in three tumors. Promoter methylation of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) was detected in 13 of 36 (36%) and 16 of 38 (42%) cases, respectively. Absent protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in 13 of 16 (82%) of the tumors with biallelic inactivating events. Overall, the frequency of 9p21 alterations was 76% and for both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), promoter methylation is the commonest mechanism of gene inactivation. Alterations at this locus were significantly more common in tumors from immunocompetent compared with immunosuppressed individuals. These data confirm the importance of inactivation of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) TSGs in the pathogenesis of cutaneous SCCs.",

Other studies have described selective deletion of exon 1beta of p14(ARF) or methylation of the p16(INK4A) promoter. Therefore, it is unclear from these studies whether loss of p16(INK4A) and/or p14(ARF) contributes to the development of T-ALL. To elucidate the relative contribution of the ink4a/arf locus to T-cell leukemogenesis, we mated our tal1 transgenic mice to ink4a/arf-/-, p16(ink4a)-/-, and p19(arf)-/- mice and generated tal1/ink4a/arf+/-, tal1/p16(ink4a)+/-, and tal1/p19(arf)+/- mice. Each of these mice developed T-cell leukemia rapidly, indicating that loss of either p16(ink4a) or p19(arf) cooperates with Tal1 to induce leukemia in mice. Preleukemic studies reveal that Tal1 expression stimulates entry into the cell cycle and thymocyte apoptosis in vivo. Interestingly, mice expressing a DNA-binding mutant of Tal1 do not exhibit increases in S phase cells. The S phase induction is accompanied by an increase in thymocyte apoptosis in tal1 transgenic mice. Whereas apoptosis is reduced to wild-type levels in tal1/ink4a/arf-/- mice, S phase induction remains unaffected. Thus, Tal1 stimulates cell cycle entry independent of the ink4a/arf locus, but its ability to induce apoptosis is Ink4a/Arf-dependent.",

Invariant inactivation of either the p16(INK4a)-cyclin D/CDK-pRb pathway and/or p53-p14(ARF) pathway occurs in most human tumors. Cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer cells contributing an alternate mechanism inactivating the p16(INK4a)/pRb pathway. Targeted overexpression of cyclin D1 to the mammary gland is sufficient for tumorigenesis, and cyclin D1-/- mice are resistant to Ras-induced mammary tumors. Recent studies suggest cyclin D1 and p16(INK4a) expression are reciprocal in human breast cancers. Herein, reciprocal regulation of cyclin D1 and p16(INK4a) was observed in tissues of mice mutant for the Ink4a/Arf locus. p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) inhibited DNA synthesis in MCF7 cells. p16(INK4a) repressed cyclin D1 expression and transcription. Repression of cyclin D1 by p16(INK4a) occurred independently of the p16(INK4a)-cdk4-binding function and required a cAMP-response element/activating transcription factor-2-binding site. p19(ARF) repressed cyclin D1 through a novel distal cis-element at -1137, which bound p53 in chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays.

To study the contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analysed the alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INC4a) and p53. After microdissection, DNA of 71 hepatocellular carcinomas was analysed for INK4-ARF inactivation and p53 mutation by DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction-enzyme related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INC4a) were assessed by differential PCR. Inactivation of p14(ARF) was found in 11/71 cases (15%), alterations of p16(INK4a) occurred in 47/71 carcinomas (66%), which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Five tumours (7%) had homozygous deletions of the INK4a-ARF locus. We failed to detect specific mutations of both exons. P16(INK4a) methylation with an unmethylated p14(ARF) promotor appeared in 39 cases. Mutations of p53 were found in 30 of 71 HCC (42%), and only one of them harboured p14(ARF) inactivation. We failed to establish alterations of the INK4a-ARF locus or p53 status as independent prognostic factor in these tumours. Our data indicate, that p14(ARF) methylation occurs independently of p16(INK4a) alterations in a subset of HCC together with wild type p53. The INK4a-ARF-/p53-pathway was disrupted in 86% of HCC, either by p53 mutations or by INK4a-ARF inactivation, and may have co-operative effects in hepatocarcinogenesis.",

However, the prognostic implications of inactivation of p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a) in MPNSTs have not been adequately investigated. Here we carried out a genetic, epigenetic, and expression analysis of p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a), and clarified the prognostic significance of their inactivation in MPNSTs.;p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a) protein expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 129 formalin-fixed samples of MPNST including 85 primary tumors. Thirty-nine samples, for which frozen material was available, were also investigated by Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a) protein and mRNA expression, and by multiplex real-time PCR, PCR single strand conformation polymorphism and methylation-specific PCR to detect p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a) gene alterations.;Immunohistochemically decreased expressions of p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), and p16(INK4a) were observed in 48%, 54%, and 49% of primary MPNSTs, respectively, and were significantly correlated with their concordant mRNA levels.

The unusual structure of this locus has lead to ambiguity regarding the biological role of each gene.

Such constructs induce extended lifespan in primary MEFs; this lifespan extension is reversed upon subsequent elimination of the p16INK4A or p19ARF antisense constructs. In immortal derivatives of cell lines expressing antisense p16INK4A or p19ARF RNA, growth arrest induced by recovery of p16INK4A expression is bypassed by compromising the function of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), whereas growth arrest induced by re-expression of p19ARF is overcome only by simultaneous inactivation of both the Rb and the p53 pathways.

Here, we investigated the expression and the prognostic value of key cell cycle proteins in the pRb and p53 pathways in both human papillomavirus type 16-positive and -negative tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas. Using immunohistochemistry, 77 tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas with known human papillomavirus type 16 status and clinical outcome were analyzed for expression of Ki67, p16(INK4A,) cyclin D1, pRb, p14(ARF), MDM2, p53, p21(Cip1/WAF1), and p27(KIP1). Results were correlated with each other and with clinical and demographic patient data. A total of 35% of tonsillar carcinomas harbored integrated human papillomavirus type 16 DNA and p16(INK4A) overexpression, both being considered essential features for human papillomavirus association. These tumors also showed the overexpression of p14(ARF) (P<0.0001) and p21(Cip1/WAF1) (P=0.001), and downregulation of pRb (P<0.0001) and cyclin D1 (P=0.027) compared with the human papillomavirus-negative cases. Univariate Cox regression analyses revealed a favorable survival rate for non-smokers (P=0.006), as well as for patients with T1-2 tumors (P<0.0001) or tumors showing low expression of cyclin D1 (P=0.028), presence of human papillomavirus and overexpression of p16(INK4A) (P=0.01), p14(ARF) (P=0.02) or p21(Cip1/WAF1) (P=0.004). In multivariate regression analyses, smoking and tumor size, as well as expression of cyclin D1 and p21(Cip1/WAF1), were found to be independent prognostic markers. We conclude that human papillomavirus positivity in tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas strongly correlates with p21(Cip1/WAF1) and p14(ARF) overexpression and downregulation of pRb and cyclin D1. In particular p21(Cip1/WAF1) overexpression is an excellent favorable prognosticator in tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas.",

First, a human papillomavirus (HPV)-dependent pathway, in which premalignant stages of vulvar cancer are the classic vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) lesions. Second, an HPV-independent pathway, associated with differentiated VIN III lesions and/or lichen sclerosus. To obtain insight into the mechanisms underlying these pathways, we determined the relationship between HPV DNA and the expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) in non- and (pre)malignant vulvar lesions. Seventy-three archival samples of non- and (pre)neoplastic vulvar lesions were selected and tested for hr-HPV DNA using a broad-spectrum HPV detection/genotyping assay (SPF(10)-LiPA) and the expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A). The prevalence of HPV increased with the severity of the classic VIN lesions; in VIN I no hr-HPV was detected, in VIN II 43%, and in VIN III 71% of the samples were hr-HPV-positive. Roughly the same was true for the expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A). The simultaneous expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) was highly associated with the presence of hr-HPV DNA. Hr-HPV was detected in only a single case of the differentiated VIN III lesions, whereas no expression of p14(ARF) was found and 16(INK4A) was present in only two cases. All 16 samples of vulvar cancer were hr-HPV DNA- negative, although in respectively 63% and 25%, p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) was expressed. No relation was found between hr-HPV and the expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) in the 20 nonneoplastic vulvar lesions. Our results provide further evidence that vulvar squamous cell carcinoma is a multifactorial disease that develops from two different pathways. First, an HPV-dependent pathway with a remarkable resemblance to CIN lesions and cervical carcinoma and second, an HPV-independent pathway in which differentiated VIN III lesions that are hr-HPV-negative may be precursors.",

In mice, the role of p16(INK4A) as the critical tumor suppressor gene at the INK4A locus was challenged when it was found that p19(ARF) only knock-out mice developed tumors, including gliomas. We have analysed the genetic status of the INK4A locus in 105 primary gliomas using both microsatellite mapping (MSM) and quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Comparison of the results of the two methods revealed agreement in 67% of the tumors examined. In discordant cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was always found to support QRT-PCR classification. Direct assessment of p14(ARF) exon 1beta, p16(INK4A) exon 1alpha and exon 2 by QRT-PCR revealed 43 (41%) homozygous and eight (7%) hemizygous deletions at the INK4A locus. In 49 (47%) gliomas, both alleles were retained. In addition, QRT-PCR, but not MSM, detected hyperploidy in five (5%) tumors. Deletion of p14(ARF) was always associated with co-deletion of p16(INK4A) and increased in frequency upon progression from low to high grade gliomas. Shorter survival was associated with homozygous deletions of INK4A in the subgroup of glioblastoma patients older than 50 years of age (P=0.025, Anova test single factor, alpha=0.05).",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the immunohistochemical expression of p16 (INK4a) in 40 oropharynx and 35 larynx from HNSCC patients treated in a single institution and followed-up at least for 10 years in order to explore potential associations with clinicopathological outcomes and prognostic implications. Forty cases (53.3%) were positive for p16 (INK4a) and this expression was more intense in non-smoking patients (P = 0.050), whose tumors showed negative vascular embolization (P = 0.018), negative lymphatic permeation (P = 0.002), and clear surgical margins (P = 0.050). Importantly, on the basis of negative p16 (INK4a) expression, it was possible to predict a probability of lower survival (P = 0.055) as well as tumors presenting lymph node metastasis (P = 0.050) and capsular rupture (P = 0.0010). Furthermore, increased risk of recurrence was observed in tumors presenting capsular rupture (P = 0.0083).

Here, to evaluate the accuracy of p16(INK4a) expression for determining HPV infection and the prognostic value of HPV infection and p16(INK4a) expression for HNSCC survival, especially oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) survival, 150 fresh-frozen HNSCC samples were analyzed for HPV DNA, E6/E7 mRNA and p16(INK4a) expression by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. p16(INK4a) expression was scored from 0 to 4 according to the percentage of p16(INK4a)-positive cells, with overexpression defined as >40% positive cells. Of the 150 tumor samples tested, 10 tumors were nasopharyngeal, 53 oropharyngeal, 39 hypopharyngeal, 24 laryngeal and 24 were located in the oral cavity. HPV DNA was detected in 47 (31.3%) samples, but only 21 also exhibited HPV mRNA expression. Inter-rater agreement was low between p16(INK4a) expression and HPV DNA presence and between p16(INK4a) expression and HPV mRNA expression, but was good between the combination of HPV DNA status and p16(INK4a) overexpression and HPV mRNA expression. Three-year recurrence-free survival was significantly higher for OPSCC patients who were HPV DNA-positive than for OPSCC patients who were HPV DNA-negative (P=0.008) and for OPSCC patients overexpressing p16(INK4a) than for without overexpressing p16(INK4a) (P=0.034). Multivariate analysis revealed that T1-3 stage and the combination of HPV DNA positivity and p16(INK4a) overexpression predicted significantly better recurrence-free survival. This combination is a more accurate marker for active HPV infection in HNSCC than HPV DNA status or general p16(INK4a)-positive status alone and offers a useful and reliable method for detecting and determining the prognosis of HPV-related HNSCC.",

Germline mutations at this locus increase susceptibility to cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). In general, missense and nonsense mutations are primarily responsible for defective p16(INK4a) and possibly p14(ARF) protein function and account for approximately 20% of inherited CMM cases. We report a G>T transversion mutation in the last nucleotide of exon 2, affecting the aspartic acid residue at position 153 of CDKN2A-p16(INK4a) in a proband with melanoma. If splicing were unaffected, this mutation would change Asp to Tyr. RT-PCR analysis, however, revealed that this mutation, which we have termed D153spl(c.457G>T), and a previously described mutation at the next nucleotide, IVS2+1G>T, result in identical aberrant splicing affecting both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). The two main alternate splice products for each of the two normal transcripts includes a 74 bp deletion in exon 2, revealing a cryptic splice site, and the complete skipping of exon 2. The dual inactivation of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) may contribute to the CMM in these families.",

Conversely, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) causally associated with carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix contributes to tumor development by inactivating p53 and Rb. Nevertheless, a correlation between expression of p14(ARF)/p16(INK4A) and HPV infection in uterine cervix is less clear. To clarify this, we examined 25 cervical cancers and 11 normal uterine cervixes. HPV was detected in 21 of 25 cervical cancers (84%) and their subtype was determined by PCR-RFLP. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays showed overexpression of p14(ARF) mRNA in all 21 HPV-positive cases (100%). p16(INK4A) mRNA was overexpressed in 17 cases of the HPV-positive cases (81%). In four HPV-negative cancers, reduced expression of p14(ARF) mRNA was detected in two cases (50%) and reduced p16(INK4A) mRNA in three cases (75%). Our data indicate that the overexpression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) strongly associates with HPV-positive cervical cancers and that reduced expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) correlates with HPV-negative cervical cancers. These findings may indicate that impaired p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) mRNA expression contribute to tumor development in HPV-negative cervical cancers by failure to support p53 and Rb instead of their inactivation by HPV E6 and E7.",

The INK4a-ARF (CDKN2A) locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes two tumour suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), which act as upstream regulators of the Rb-CDK4 and p53 pathways. To study the contribution of each pathway in pleomorphic adenomas, this study analysed alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, and pRb in these tumours. After microdissecting the different histological components, 42 pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland were analysed for INK4a-ARF inactivation by DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction enzyme-related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), mRNA expression, microsatellite analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) were assessed by differential PCR. The status of p53 and Rb was examined by direct sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Using microdissection, it was possible to examine the tumour components, i.e. epithelial, mesenchymal, and transitional, separately after immunohistochemical identification. Methylation of p14(ARF) was found in 1/42 cases and alterations of p16(INK4a) occurred in 12/42 of pleomorphic adenomas, which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Microdeletions or specific mutations of either exon were not detected. Methylation was detected exclusively in the epithelial and transitional components and not within the mesenchymal part of the tumour. p53 mutations were detected in 4/42 adenomas, also occurring solely in the epithelial components of the tumours. pRb was detected immunohistochemically in 40/42 adenomas. In normal, corresponding parotid tissue, p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, and pRb alterations were not observed. The observation that alterations of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a), and also p53 mutations, occurred exclusively in the epithelial and transitional components of pleomorphic adenoma supports the theory that these areas are prone to malignant transformation to carcinoma in adenoma.",

Both the proapoptotic and cell cycle-regulatory functions of p14 ARF were initially proposed to be strictly dependent on a functional p53/mdm-2 tumor suppressor pathway. However, a number of recent reports have implicated p53-independent mechanisms in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction by p14 ARF. Here, we show that the G1 cell cycle arrest induced by p14 ARF entirely depends on both p53 and p21 in human HCT116 and DU145 carcinoma cells. In contrast, neither loss of p53 nor p21 impaired apoptosis induction by p14 ARF as evidenced by nuclear DNA fragmentation, phosphatidyl serine exposure, and caspase activation, which included caspase-3/7- and caspase-9-like activities. However, lack of functional p21 resulted in the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and markedly enhanced p14 ARF-induced apoptosis that was, nevertheless, efficiently inhibited by the cell permeable broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O)-methyl)-fluoromethylketone). Thus, loss of cell cycle restriction point control in the absence of p21 may interfere with p14 ARF-induced apoptosis. Finally, these data indicate that the signaling events required for G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction by p14 ARF dissociate upstream of p53.",

However, significant controversy exists regarding the role of p63 isoforms as oncoproteins or tumor suppressors. Here, lentiviruses were developed to drive long-term overexpression of ΔNp63α in primary keratinocytes. Elevated levels of ΔNp63α in vitro promote long-term survival and block both replicative and oncogene-induced senescence in primary keratinocytes, as evidenced by the expression of SA-β-gal and the presence of nuclear foci of heterochromatin protein 1γ. The contribution of ΔNp63α to cancer development was assessed using an in vivo grafting model of experimental skin tumorigenesis that allows distinction between benign and malignant tumors. Grafted lenti-ΔNp63α keratinocytes do not form tumors, whereas lenti-GFP/v-ras(Ha) keratinocytes develop well-differentiated papillomas. Lenti-ΔNp63α/v-ras(Ha) keratinocytes form undifferentiated carcinomas. The average volume of lenti-ΔNp63α/v-ras(Ha) tumors was significantly higher than those in the lenti-GFP/v-ras(Ha) group, consistent with increased BrdU incorporation detected by immunohistochemistry. The block in oncogene-induced senescence corresponds to sustained levels of E2F1 and phosphorylated AKT, and is associated with loss of induction of p16(ink4a)/p19(arf). The relevance of p16(ink4a)/p19(arf) loss was demonstrated in grafting studies of p19(arf)-null keratinocytes, which develop malignant carcinomas in the presence of v-ras(Ha) similar to those arising in wildtype keratinocytes that express lenti-ΔNp63α and v-ras(Ha).

This decrease is partly caused by the increasing expression of let-7b microRNA, which is known to target HMGA2.

In the present study, alleles of Pctr1, Cdkn2a, and D4Mit15 from a resistant strain (BALB/cDAG) carrying DBA/2 chromatin were introgressively backcrossed to the susceptible BALB/c strain. The resultant C.DAG-Pctr1 Cdkn2a D4Mit15 congenic was more resistant to plasmacytomagenesis than BALB/c, thus narrowing Pctr1 to a 1.5-cM interval. Concomitantly, resistant C57BL/6 mice, from which both gene products of the Cdkn2a gene have been eliminated, developed pristane-induced plasma cell tumors over a shorter latency period than the traditionally susceptible BALB/cAn strain. Biological assays of the p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) alleles from BALB/c and DBA/2 indicated that the BALB/c p16(INK4a) allele was less active than its DBA/2 counterpart in inducing growth arrest of mouse plasmacytoma cell lines and preventing ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, while the two p19(ARF) alleles displayed similar potencies in both assays.

One of the products, the cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a, is functionally inactivated by mutations or deletions in a wide variety of cancers. However, because many such mutations reside in exon 2, they also affect the alternative reading frame (ARF) protein. To determine whether such mutations disrupt p19ARF function, we introduced naturally occurring missense mutations into mouse INK4a exon 2 sequences and tested mutant p16INK4a and p19ARF proteins for their ability to inhibit cell cycle progression. Six p19ARF point mutants remained fully active in mediating cell cycle arrest in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas two of the corresponding mutations within p16INK4a resulted in complete loss of activity. Analysis of p19ARF deletion mutants indicated that the unique aminoterminal domain encoded by exon 1 beta was both necessary and sufficient for inducing G1 arrest. Therefore, cancer-associated mutations within exon 2 of the INK4a gene specifically target p16INK4a, and not p19ARF, for inactivation.",

The product of the alpha transcript, p16(INK4a), is a recognized tumour suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by the cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6. In contrast, the product of the human CDKN2A beta transcript, p14(ARF), activates a p53 response manifest in elevated levels of MDM2 and p21(CIP1) and cell cycle arrest in both G1 and G2/M. As a consequence, p14(ARF)-induced cell cycle arrest is p53 dependent and can be abrogated by the co-expression of human papilloma virus E6 protein. p14(ARF) acts by binding directly to MDM2, resulting in the stabilization of both p53 and MDM2. Conversely, p53 negatively regulates p14(ARF) expression and there is an inverse correlation between p14(ARF) expression and p53 function in human tumour cell lines. However, p14(ARF) expression is not involved in the response to DNA damage. These results place p14(ARF) in an independent pathway upstream of p53 and imply that CDKN2A encodes two proteins that are involved in tumour suppression.",

Both p16 and p14 were lowly expressed in SCCHN and HARM, and their mRNA expression levels were positively associated with each other (P < 0.01). Moreover, BMI1 was highly expressed in both SCCHN and HARM, and BMI1 overexpression was associated with p16 downregulation in SCCHN (P < 0.05).

The absence of TGFbeta responsiveness noted in cultured uveal melanoma cells also suggests that the TGFbeta pathway plays a role in the formation of this tumor. Therefore, mutational screening was performed in several key genes in tumor-suppressor pathways that are known to be altered in some uveal melanomas.;Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis and DNA sequencing, a series of 67 uveal melanomas were screened for inactivating mutations in the TGFbeta pathway members Smad4 and TGFbeta receptor type 2 (TGFbetaR2), the downstream cell-cycle inhibitor p15(INK4B), and the cell-cycle inhibitors p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A). p16(INK4A) was also investigated for promoter hypermethylation.

As this mutation occurs in the first exon of INK4a (exon 1alpha), it has no effect on the primary sequence of p14(ARF). Based on both in vitro and in vivo analyses, the R24P variant is specifically defective for binding to CDK4 but remains able to associate with CDK6. Nevertheless, Milan HDFs behave as if they are p16INK4a deficient, in terms of sensitivity to spontaneous and oncogene-induced senescence, and the R24P variant has little effect on proliferation when ectopically expressed in normal fibroblasts. It can, however, impair the proliferation of U20S cells, presumably because they express more CDK6 than primary fibroblasts.

Alternative splicing of the CDKN2A gene results in the expression of p14(ARF). Interestingly, not only p16 and p15, but also the structurally unrelated p14(ARF) appear to function as negative cell cycle regulators. Concerted inactivation of p16, p15 and p14(ARF) could be demonstrated in seven of nine glioblastoma cell lines. Strong suppression of tumorigenicity after transfection with p16 and p15 alone or in combination was seen in cell lines containing neither endogenous p16 nor p15 but functional pRB. Significantly weaker growth suppression was observed in tumors either retaining expression of both p16 and p15 or p15 only. p14(ARF) proved to be a potent tumor suppressor in the presence of wild-type p53, while mutant p53 substantially reduced growth inhibition by p14(ARF). No differences between p16 and p15 effects could be observed, suggesting a largely overlapping function of p16 and p15. To facilitate further research into p16/p15 effects, three cell lines with conditional, tetracycline-controlled p16 expression were established. Reversible growth suppression mediated by p16 was observed in these models. Combined inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, i.e., loss of both p16 and p15 as well as p14(ARF), results in disruption of two major growth control pathways involving pRB and p53 in malignant gliomas.

In this study, we report the discovery of a novel variant of p16(INK4A), termed p16gamma, in a primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient sample and a neuroblastoma cell line, which was expressed at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Cloning and sequencing of the p16gamma cDNA revealed that p16gamma was identical to p16(INK4A), except that it contained an in-frame insertion of 197 bp between exons 2 and 3. p16gamma expression was detected in the majority of p16(INK4A)-expressing primary T-ALL and B-ALL patient samples and other p16(INK4A)-expressing tumor samples, but was only barely detectable in some normal mononuclear cells and other non-tumor samples. Structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism confirmed that p16gamma, like p16(INK4A), is also an ankyrin-repeat protein. Functional analysis of p16gamma revealed that p16gamma protein interacted with cyclin D-dependent kinase4 and inhibited its kinase activity. Using a luciferase reporter assay, the transfection of p16gamma repressed the E2F response, the downstream target of pRB, with an efficacy equivalent to that of p16(INK4A).

The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN2A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a) locus encodes two distinct tumor suppressors, p16INK4a and p19ARF, whose functions interrelate in the regulation of cell proliferation as key components of the retinoblastoma and p53 pathways, respectively. In many types of cancer, alterations of Cdkn2a abrogate the functions of both suppressors, implying that both are integral to the genesis of certain cancer types. While this has been observed in mouse lung adenocarcinogenesis, recent observations also suggested that naturally occurring variation at the Cdkn2a locus is probably operative in the development of these tumors. Firstly, two common haplotypes of mouse Cdkn2a have been identified, each of which encodes cosegregating variants of p16INK4a and p19ARF. The p16INK4a variants differ at amino acids 18 (histidine or proline) and 51 (valine or isoleucine), whereas the p19ARF variants differ only at amino acid 72 (histidine or arginine). Secondly, genetic resistance to lung tumor formation appears to segregate with one particular haplotype, which also is deleted preferentially in lung adenocarcinomas of Cdkn2a heterozygous mice. Here we attempt to explain these observations and to characterize further the roles of p16INK4 and p19ARF in mouse lung tumorigenesis by examining the function and expression of each of the variants of Cdkn2a. Functional analysis showed that the proline 18/isoleucine 51 p16INK4a variant was diminished in cdk6 binding, cdk6 inhibition and NIH/3T3 fibroblast growth suppression compared with the histidine 18/valine 51 variant, whereas both of the p19ARF variants suppressed growth with similar potencies. Also, the different alleles for p16INK4a and p19ARF were transcribed equally in the normal lungs of Cdkn2a heterozygotes, as determined by comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. These results indicate that strain-specific variation in p16INK4a function is exploited in mouse lung tumorigenesis and strongly implicate a role for p16INK4a in lung cancer predisposition and development.",

We investigated the involvement of the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and p53 genes in AK and in the progression of AK to SCC. Mutational analysis on exons 1a, 1b and 2 of the CDKN2A locus and exon 1 of the CDKN2B locus as well as allelic imbalance was performed in 26 AK specimens. Expression levels of the genes p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a) and p53 were examined in 16 AKs and 12 SCCs by real-time RT-PCR. A previously described polymorphism of p16(INK4a) (Ala148Thr) was detected at an allelic frequency of 12%. Six samples carried novel mutations at codon 71 of the CDKN2A locus and one sample presented an additional mutation at codon 65. Two AK samples carried a not-previously described non-UV type missense mutation at codon 184 (Val184Glu) of exon 1b in the p14(ARF) gene. Regarding the CDKN2B locus a new mutation at codon 50 (Ala50Thr) and another at codon 24 (Arg24Arg), were detected. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was found in 15% of AKs in at least one marker, indicating that genetic instability has some implication in the development of AK. Down-regulation of p16(INK4a) and p53 mRNA levels was noted in SCC compared to AK. TSGs expression levels in sun-exposed morphologically normal-appearing skin, suggests that abnormal growth stimuli might exist in these tissues as well. Furthermore, we suggest a possible role of p15(INK4b), independently from the intracellular pathway mediated by p16(INK4a), and of p14(ARF) in AK development, as well as in the progression of AK to SCC. The deregulation of the expression profiles of the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and p53 genes may, independently of mutations and LOH at 9p21, play a significant role in AK and progression of AK to SCC.",

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out to determine changes in the expression of the genes due to hypermethylation. Hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a), p14(ARF) and p15(INK4b) gene promoters was observed in 36, 8.8 and 11.2%, respectively, of 125 cervical cancer samples from a north Indian population. Methylation of p16(INK4a) was significantly (P<0.001) associated with the cervical cancer cases. Significant association of p16(INK4a) hypermethylation with passive smoking and oral contraceptive use was also observed. Methylation of p15(INK4b) was also found to be significant (P<0.05). Our findings did not reveal any correlation between the promoter methylation of p16(INK4a), p14(ARF) and p15(INK4b) with factors, including age and human papillomavirus infection. mRNA expression was significantly reduced in patients with a methylated promoter (P<0.001) of p16(INK4a) compared to patients with an unmethylated promoter.

Moreover, transduction of Ink4a/Arf(-/-) neural stem cells (NSCs) or astrocytes with constitutively active EGFR induces a common high-grade glioma phenotype. These findings identify NSCs and astrocytes as equally permissive compartments for gliomagenesis and provide evidence that p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) synergize to maintain terminal astrocyte differentiation.

Whereas the mouse ARF (p19ARF) consists of 169 amino acids, the human ARF (p14ARF) consists of 132 amino acids, truncated at the C-terminus. Molecular studies on the regulation of ARF activity by its binding partners have revealed that mouse ARF protein, but not human ARF protein, interacts with a cytoplasmic protein, Pex19p. This interaction of mouse ARF with Pex19p results in its milder p53 activation function in mouse cells as compared to human cells and thus accounts, at least in part, for the weaker tumor surveillance and frequent immortalization of mouse cells.",

Loss of INK4A is a frequent molecular alteration involved in the genesis of several neoplasms, including tumors of neuroectodermal origin. This study investigated the frequency of INK4A gene alterations in a series of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and neurofibromas (NFs). INK4A gene and the p19(ARF)-specific exon 1beta were studied in 11 MPNST samples from 8 patients and 7 neurofibromas. Presence of INK4A deletions was assessed by Southern blotting hybridization and by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR). INK4A point mutations were examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing. The p16 promoter methylation status was determined by PCR amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA. Homozygous deletions of exon 2, thus affecting both p16 and p19(ARF), were identified in MPNSTs from 4 of 8 patients. Deletions, mutations, or silencing by methylation were not identified in the neurofibromas analyzed. Based on our results, we conclude that INK4A deletions are frequent events in MPNSTs and may participate in tumor progression.

We have cloned and characterized a 2.5 kb region upstream of the murine p19(ARF) gene to determine the role of DNA methylation in suppressing p19(ARF) transcription in a wide panel of murine primary T cell lymphomas. This region contains a DNA fragment with the characteristics of a CpG island similar to those described for the murine p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes. Expression of p19(ARF) is decreased in a significant number (20%) of the murine lymphomas analyzed. Overexpression of the p19(ARF) transcript is also frequent, suggesting alterations in molecules of the retinoblastoma or p53 pathways that are involved in p19(ARF) regulation. Although hypermethylation of the INK4a and INK4b promoters is frequently involved in murine lymphomas, the p19(ARF) CpG island is infrequently methylated in the murine primary lymphomas studied in this work. Since loss of p19(ARF) expression cannot be explained as the result of homozygous deletions or hypermethylation of the ARF gene, other regulatory mechanisms seem to be altered in these malignancies.",

All focal areas examined had Gleason scores ranging from 1 to 5. Methylation of either PTEN or p73 was undetected in any sample, whereas expression of MDM2 seemed to be an independent event within small foci of 4 of 16 tumors. Loss of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), RB1, and p27(Kip1) expression correlated with homozygous deletion or promoter hypermethylation. One carcinoma showed co-deletion of both p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) in two of five areas examined; two areas within another tumor demonstrated concurrent hypermethylation of the promoter regions of the same genes. Focal hypermethylation of RB1, p21(Waf1), and p27(Kip1) was detected within two, two, and three tumors, respectively. These findings indicate that both genetic and epigenetic events occur independently in intratumor foci and further suggest hypermethylation-induced loss of gene function may be as critical as specific genetic mutations in prostate carcinogenesis.",

P16 is deleted or mutated at high frequency in a variety of tumor cell lines including melanoma and bladder carcinoma lines. As such, it is likely to be a tumor suppressor gene. Here we show that P16 is mutated in primary bladder carcinomas (3 of 33) and melanomas (5 of 34). These findings support studies that show P16 mutations are not solely a product of growth in tissue culture but rather are involved in formation of tumors in viva. Some bladder primary tumors and some bladder and melanoma tumor cell lines contain mutations in both P16 and P53 at frequencies that suggest that p53 and p16 function in different pathways, each of which is important in suppressing malignant transformation.",

Inactivation of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor protein, encoded by MTS1, is thought to be the major functional consequence of these chromosomal rearrangements. The two other cell cycle inhibitors encoded by genes identified in the locus (p19ARF by MTS1 and p15INK4b by MTS2), also represent possible candidates for inactivating events. By analyzing p16INK4a expression in three cases in which an identical 36-kb deletion had deleted MTS2 and disrupted the p19ARF, but spared the p16INK4a MTS1 encoding exons, we have excluded p16INK4a and pinpointed p19ARF and/or p15INK4b as the functional target(s) of this rearrangement. Moreover, by the study of the MTS genomic configuration of 149 rearranged alleles from a large series of T-ALL cases, we have shown that p19ARF encoding exons were always disrupted or deleted, whereas p16INK4a and p15INK4b encoding exons were spared in four and 21 cases, respectively.

Loss of INK4 gene product function, particularly that of p16(INK4a), is found in 10-60% of human tumors, suggesting that broadly applicable anticancer therapies might be based on restoration of p16(INK4a) CDK inhibitory function. Although much less frequent, defects of p19(INK4d) have also been associated with human cancer (osteosarcomas). The protein structures of some INK4 family members, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray techniques, have begun to clarify the functional role of p16(INK4a) and the dysfunction introduced by the mutations associated with human tumors.;The crystal structure of human p19(INK4d) has been determined at 1.8 A resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement methods. The fold of p19(INK4d) produces an oblong molecule comprising five approximately 32-residue ankyrin-like repeats. The architecture of the protein demonstrates the high structural similarity within the INK4 family. Comparisons to other ankyrin-repeat-containing proteins (GABPbeta, 53BP2 and myotrophin) show similar structures with comparable hydrogen-bonding patterns and hydrophobic interactions. Such comparisons highlight the splayed beta-loop geometry that is specific to INK4 inhibitors. This geometry is the result of a modified ankyrin structure in the second repeat.;Among the INK4 inhibitors, the highest amino acid sequence conservation is found in the helical stacks; this conservation creates a conserved beta-loop geometry specific to INK4 inhibitors. Therefore, in addition to models which predict that the conserved helix alpha6 is responsible for CDK inhibition, a binding mode whereby the loops of INK4 proteins bind to the CDKs should also be considered. A similar loop-based interaction is seen in the complex formed between the ankyrin-repeat-containing protein GABPbeta and_GABPalpha. This mode of binding would be consistent with the observation that p16(INK4a) is sensitive to deleterious mutations found throughout this tumor suppressor protein; these mutations probably destabilize the three-dimensional structure.",

In experimental systems, the loss of SMARCB1 is hypothesized to alter p16(INK4A) pathways resulting in the repression of tumor suppressors. To determine whether these pathways are deregulated in human MRT, we used immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays to evaluate p16(INK4A)/E2F1/RB and p14(ARF)/MDM2/p53 pathways in 25 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) and 11 non-CNS MRT. p16(INK4A) was negative or showed focal weak expression. p16(INK4A) downstream targets CDK4/cyclin D1/ppRB were variably expressed at moderate to low levels; E2F1 was negative. Unexpectedly, p14(ARF) expression was seen in many cases, which correlated positively with p53 and inversely with MDM2 immunostaining in AT/RT. TP53 mutational analysis in 19 of 25 AT/RT and in 8 of 11 non-CNS MRT cases showed point mutations in only 3 AT/RT cases, suggesting that p53 expression was driven mainly by p14(ARF). Finally, nucleophosmin, a protein that stabilizes p53, was positive in most cases and colocalized with p53. Together, these data suggest that, in MRT, there is deregulation not only of p16(INK4A) but also of the p14(ARF) pathway. These results provide insights into cell cycle deregulation in the pathogenesis of human MRT and may aid in the design and evaluation of potential therapies for these tumors.",

Many cell cycle regulators, such as p14(ARF), p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a), are important in G1 cell cycle arrest and oncogene-induced senescence. The bcl-2 protein is one of the key components that control apoptosis, while the p53 protein plays key roles in both mechanisms. The genes of these key regulator proteins are often mutated or deleted in various malignancies. It is unknown how senescence and apoptosis are regulated in one of the most common tumors of the female genital tract, cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this study the, expression of senescence, apoptosis and proliferation markers in normal cervical epithelium, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and SCC are characterized via immunohistochemical staining for p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), bcl-2, p53 and Ki-67 in tissue microarray blocks containing 20 samples each of normal cervix, moderate-to-severe cervical dysplasia (CIN II-III) and invasive SCC. Samples are derived from 60 total cases of cervical biopsies and cervical conizations. Results showed that the proliferation marker, Ki-67, is markedly increased, and the senescence markers, p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) are overexpressed in both dysplasia and carcinoma. P53 immunostain is negative in all normal cervical tissue, and positive in dysplasia and carcinoma. Although the expression of bcl-2 is increased in dysplasia, this marker is negative in approximately half of SCC cases. These results suggest that some senescence pathways are activated and are still maintained in cervical dysplasia and carcinoma. However proliferation is increased and carcinogenesis is not thwarted, leading to eventual development of cervical cancer. Other mechanisms, such as those that account for the apparent overexpression of p53 and paradoxical loss of bcl-2 expression in some SCC cases, as well as additional senescence and apoptotic pathways, may play key roles carcinogenesis of cervical SCC.",

We and others found that p16INK4a overexpression is associated with improved therapy response and survival of patients with HNSCC treated with radiotherapy. However, the functional role of p16INK4a in HNSCC remains unexplored. Our results implicate p16INK4a in regulation of homologous recombination-mediated DNA damage response independently from its role in control of the cell cycle. We found that expression of p16INK4a dramatically affects radiation sensitivity of HNSCC cells. p16INK4a overexpression impairs the recruitment of RAD51 to the site of DNA damage in HPV-positive cells by downregulating of cyclin D1 protein expression. Consistent with the in vitro findings, immunostaining of HNSCC patient samples revealed that high levels p16INK4a expression significantly correlated with decreased cyclin D1 expression. In summary, these findings reveal an unexpected function of p16INK4a in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair response and imply p16INK4a status as an independent marker to predict response of patients with HNSCC to radiotherapy.",

The INK4A gene encodes two cell cycle regulators, p16(INK4A) and ARF, while INK4B encodes p15(INK4B). Previously, we have shown that the p16(INK4) tumor suppressor was not mutated or deleted in primary breast carcinomas. However, primary and metastatic breast carcinomas exhibited a relative hypomethylation of p16(INK4A), which is associated with expression, compared to normal breast tissue. The present study was conducted to determine if inactivation of p15(INK4B) and INK4A exon 1beta (ARF) are common events in breast carcinoma. Mutational analysis was performed by PCR-SSCP, and mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. Methylation-specific PCR was used to determine the methylation status of the p15(INK4B) promoter. Our results demonstrate that the p15(INK4B) gene was altered in 3 (21%) of the 14 breast cell lines; one had a silent mutation and two had homozygous deletion of the gene. None of the cell lines showed methylation of p15(INK4B). Two (14%) cell lines had homozygous deletion of INK4A exon 1beta. All normal and malignant breast tissue samples were wild-type and non-methylated for p15(INK4B) and wild-type for exon 1beta. Our results show that these structurally and functionally related genes are not invariably affected together, and the most frequently observed alteration at the INK4A and INK4B loci in breast carcinoma appears to be p16(INK4A) hypomethylation.",

To clarify carcinogenesis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we examined 44 primary OSCCs for alterations of p16 and p14ARF mRNA expression, the methylation status of the p16 gene promoter, the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 9p21 locus, and p16 and p14ARF gene mutations. Alterations of p16 and p14ARF mRNA expression were seen in 27 (61.4%) of 44 and 10 (22.7%) of 44 of OSCC samples, respectively. Methylation of the p16 gene promoter region was detected in 28 (63.6%) of 44 samples, and LOH at 9p21 locus was found in 30 (68.2%) of 44. p16 and p14ARF gene mutations were observed in 4 (9.0%) of 44 and 2 (4.5%) of 44 samples, respectively. Suspected homozygous deletion (HD) was seen in 9 (20.5%) of 44. All cases except one (97.7%) showed alterations in p16, p14ARF, and their locus.

Using recombinant EBV-BAC viruses expressing conditional EBNA3C (3CHT), we developed a system that allows inactivation of EBNA3C in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) lacking active p16(INK4a) protein but expressing a functional 14(ARF)-fusion protein (p14/p16). The INK4a locus is epigenetically repressed by EBNA3C--in cooperation with EBNA3A--despite the absence of functional p16(INK4a). Although inactivation of EBNA3C in LCLs from normal B cells leads to an increase in p16(INK4a) and growth arrest, EBNA3C inactivation in the p16(INK4a)-null LCLs has no impact on the rate of proliferation, establishing that the repression of INK4a is a major function of EBNA3C in EBV-driven LCL proliferation. This conditional LCL system allowed us to use microarray analysis to identify and confirm genes regulated specifically by EBNA3C, independently of proliferation changes modulated by the p16(INK4a)-Rb-E2F axis. Infections of normal primary B cells with recombinant EBV-BAC virus from which EBNA3C is deleted or with 3CHT EBV in the absence of activating ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen, revealed that EBNA3C is necessary to overcome an EBV-driven increase in p16(INK4a) expression and concomitant block to proliferation 2-4 weeks post-infection. If cells are p16(INK4a)-null, functional EBNA3C is dispensable for the outgrowth of LCLs.",

The correlation between allelic loss and the clinicopathologic parameters of NPC tissues was examined. In addition, putative TSGs including FHIT, p16(INK4a), and p19(ARF) were selected for mutation screening to investigate their potential participation in NPC tumorigenesis.;Of 3787 informative allelotyping data, 25 frequent allelic losses (or loss of heterozygosity [LOH]) in 13 cytogenetic loci were identified based on a deletion frequency that was greater than the average of allelic loss on that particular chromosome. Several significant associations were determined after statistical analysis of the correlation between allelic loss and clinicopathologic parameters. The allelic losses by D9S318 and D11S1304 were associated with N2/N3 (P = 0.035 and P = 0.005, respectively), and those by D9S905 and D11S1304 were associated with grouped American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage III/IV samples (P = 0.022 and P = 0.017, respectively) of NPC tissues. In addition, three MDRs were revealed on 3p25.3-24.1 (< 19 cM), 3p23-21.31 (< 9 cM), and 11q22.1-23.2 (< 8 cM). To examine somatic mutations in previously reported TSGs located near these frequent LOH loci, three candidate genes, p16(INK4a), p19(ARF), and FHIT, were analyzed. Point mutations in the coding region of FHIT and in the intron 1 splicing acceptor site of both p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) were detected in NPC cell lines.

More important, one somatic mutation in NPC cell lines on the intron 1/exon 2 splicing acceptor site of the INK4a/ARF locus was found to result in exon 2 skipping both p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) transcripts, which presumably inactivates the functions of both the p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) proteins.",

In 20 HCCs, the frequency of homozygous deletions was 20% in exon 1 of p15(INK4B), 20% in exon 2 of p15(INK4B), 10% in exon 1beta of p16(INK4A), 25% in exon 1alpha of p16(INK4A), 15% in exon 2 of p16(INK4A), and 15% in exon 3 of p16(INK4A). The authors found hypermethylation of the p16(INK4A) promoter region in 7 HCCs (35%) and 3 HCC cell lines (43%). The overall frequency of p16 alterations in HCCs, including hypermethylation and homozygous deletions, was 60% (12 of 20 cases). According to reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, the absence of RNA expression was most frequent in p16 (11 of 20 cases, 55%) and less frequent in p15 (7 of 20 cases, 35%) and p14(ARF) (5 of 20 cases, 25%).;Among the 3 cell cycle regulator proteins encoded at the 9p21 genetic locus, inactivation of p16 is the most frequent event in HCCs in which promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions are the common mechanisms.",

CpG sites within the 5'-flanking region and exon 1beta of p14(ARF) are targets of aberrant methylation and transcriptional silencing in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we have developed methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSPCR) methods to detect methylation of CpG sites in p14(ARF) in CRC cell lines and primary CRC tumors, and correlated p14(ARF) mRNA expression with methylation in CRC cell lines using competitive quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods. Ten CRC cell lines were studied; three (DLD-1, HCT15 and SW48) showed extensive methylation and six (Colo320, SW480, HT29, Caco2, SW837 and WiDr) were unmethylated; the other cell line, LoVo, showed partial methylation that affected exon 1beta but not the immediate upstream CpG sites. p14(ARF) mRNA was expressed at extremely low levels in fully methylated cell lines and at 10(4)- to 10(5)-fold higher levels in unmethylated cell lines. p14(ARF) expression in the partially methylated LoVo cell line was intermediate. Treatment of LoVo cells with 2 microM 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine for 72 h was associated with marked (100-fold) induction of mRNA levels. Of 119 primary CRCs, 18% contained p14(ARF) methylation, although partial methylation was the most common pattern observed (in 67% of methylated tumors). Methylation of p14(ARF) was often accompanied by p16(INK4a) methylation; however, 50% of p14(ARF) methylated tumors contained unmethylated p16(INK4a). Methylation at p14(ARF) was associated with female gender, greater age, proximal anatomic location and poor differentiation, but not stage at diagnosis. A two-step MSPCR method for assaying p14(ARF) methylation in human tumors is described.",

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease where the mechanism producing increased hematopoiesis is still unknown. To investigate possible defects in cell-cycle regulation in PV, the expression of Rb and CDK inhibitor gene messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in highly purified human erythroid colony-forming cells (ECFCs) was screened using an RNase protection assay (RPA) and 11 gene probes. It was found that RNA representing exon 2 of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) was enhanced by 2.8- to 15.9-fold in 11 patients with PV. No increase of exon 2 mRNA was evident in the T cells of patients with PV, or in the ECFCs and T cells from patients with secondary polycythemia. p27 also had elevated mRNA expression in PV ECFCs, but to a lesser degree. Because the INK4a/ARF locus encodes 2 tumor suppressors, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) with the same exon 2 sequence, the increased mRNA fragment could represent either one. To clarify this, mRNA representing the unique first exons of INK4a and ARF were analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This demonstrated that mRNAs from the first exons of both genes were increased in erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage cells and Western blot analysis showed that the INK4a protein (p16(INK4a)) was increased in PV ECFCs. Sequencing revealed no mutations of INK4a or ARF in 10 patients with PV. p16(INK4a) is an important negative cell-cycle regulator, but in contrast with a wide range of malignancies where inactivation of the INK4a gene is one of the most common carcinogenetic events, in PV p16( INK4a) expression was dramatically increased without a significant change in ECFC cell cycle compared with normal ECFCs. It is quite likely that p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) are not the pathogenetic cause of PV, but instead represent a cellular response to an abnormality of a downstream regulator of proliferation such as cyclin D, CDK4/CDK6, Rb, or E2F. Further work to delineate the function of these genes in PV is in progress. (Blood. 2001;97:3424-3432)",

The bulk of this variation is stochastic and functionally neutral, with only a small minority representing \"drivers\" that contribute to the genesis and maintenance of tumors. Drivers are often directly or inversely correlated across tumors, reflecting the molecular and regulatory signaling pathways in which they operate. Here, a profile of genetic and epigenetic drivers in 110 human melanoma cell lines was generated and searched for non-random distribution patterns. Statistically significant mutual exclusivity was revealed among components of each of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-RB, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed between promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor β (RARB) and CDKN2A alterations affecting p14(ARF) (P < 0.0001), suggesting a functional link between RARβ signaling and the melanoma-suppressive activities of p14(ARF). Mechanistically, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment increased the expression of p14(ARF) in primary human melanocytes and the steady-state levels of p14(ARF) in these cells were shown to be regulated via RARβ. Furthermore, the ability of ATRA to induce senescence is reduced in p14(ARF)-depleted melanocytes, and we provide proof-of-concept that ATRA can induce irreversible growth arrest in melanoma cells with an intact RARβ-p14(ARF) signaling axis, independent of p16(INK4A) and p53 status.;These data highlight the power of mutual exclusivity analysis of cancer drivers to unravel molecular pathways and establish a previously unrecognized cross-talk between RARβ and p14(ARF) with potential implications for melanoma treatment.",

We previously demonstrated that this locus is altered in human skin carcinomas. In the present study we have studied the expression of the p16(INK4A-ARF) locus following UVB irradiation of normal human keratinocytes both at the mRNA (RT-PCR) and at the protein (Western blotting) levels. Our data confirmed that P16(INK4A) protein is induced by UVB at low (30 mJ cm(2)) and high (100 mJ cm(2)) doses and is observed after a single or repeated exposure implying that this response is involved in both the immediate and adaptative response to UVB. The apparent absence of induction p16(INK4A) mRNA suggested that P16(INK4A) protein is upregulated at the post-transcriptional level. Analysis by flow cytometry and BrdU staining indicated that the highest protein level of P16(INK4A) in the cells was associated with a G(2) cell cycle arrest. Comparative analysis of P16(INK4A) and P53 showed that they were differentially modulated in keratinocytes according to the UVB dose and regimen. Low, acute or repeated UVB exposures led to accumulation of both P16(INK4A) and p53, whereas at high UVB doses, P53 and P53-dependent genes were not induced or even downregulated and only a slight but reproducible stabilization of P16(INK4A) protein was observed. In our conditions, P14(ARF) did not seem to participate in the UV response in these cells as P14(ARF) protein did not vary. These results infer that P16(INK4A) plays a role in cell cycle regulation of keratinocytes submitted to UVB irradiation.

The prevalence of p16(INK4a), DAP-kinase, E-Cadherin, and RASSF1A promoter methylation was 26/80 (32.5%), 19/80 (23.8%), 29/80 (36.3%), 6/80 (7.5%) respectively. In 48 cases (60%), at least one of these promoters was methylated. There was a significant association of methylation of any of these genes and ever smoking (P=0.006). p16(INK4a) gene promoter methylation was associated with a younger age of smoking initiation (P<0.03); E-Cadherin promoter methylation was associated with an increased number of pack years smoked (P<0.03). We also found an association of methylation of any gene and T status (OR=2.7, P<0.05). Tumors with p16(INK4a) methylation were significantly less likely to show lymph node metastasis (P<0.001). DAP-kinase promoter methylation was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and this relationship was dependent upon p16(INK4a) promoter methylation status. Our results suggest that, in HNSCC, promoter methylation of these four genes accumulates with increasing tumor size. This may reflect distinct pathways of somatic inactivation leading to cancer; additional larger studies are needed to further investigate this possibility.

A number of studies have shown that hSNF5 re-expression blocks MRT cell proliferation. However, the pathway through which hSNF5 acts remains unknown. To address this question, we generated MRT-derived cell lines in which restoration of hSNF5 expression leads to an accumulation in G(0)/G(1), induces cellular senescence and increased apoptosis. Following hSNF5 expression, we observed transcriptional activation of the tumor suppressor p16(INK4a) but not of p14(ARF), repression of several cyclins and CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein implicated in metastasis. Chromatin immunoprecipitations indicated that hSNF5 activates p16(INK4a) transcription and CD44 down-regulation by mediating recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex. Thus, hSNF5 acts as a dualistic co-regulator that, depending on the promoter context, can either mediate activation or repression. Three lines of evidence established that p16(INK4a) is an essential effector of hSNF5-induced cell cycle arrest. 1) Overexpression of p16(INK4a) mimics the effect of hSNF5 induction and leads to cellular senescence. 2) Expression of a p16(INK4a)-insensitive form of CDK4 obstructs hSNF5-induced cell cycle arrest. 3) Inhibition of p16(INK4a) activation by siRNA blocks hSNF5-mediated cellular senescence.

Methylation of the p15 and p16 genes was detected, respectively, in 64% and 32% of the B-cell lymphomas, in 44% and 22% of the T-cell lymphomas, and in none of the 5 reactive lymph nodes analyzed. Both p15 and p16 genes were methylated more often in the high-grade (78% and 50%, respectively) than in the low-grade B-cell lymphomas (55% and 21%, respectively). For 5 cases, mapping of the methylated CpGs of the p16 promoter region confirmed the results of REP and MSP. In addition, a large variation in the methylation patterns of p16 exon 1 was observed, not only from one lymphoma to another, but also within a given tumor. Methylation of p15 and p16 was associated with an absence of gene expression, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. The p14 gene was unmethylated and normally expressed in all 56 tumors. We found no mutations of p15, p16, or p14 in any of the 56 lymphomas. Our results suggest a role for p15 and p16 gene methylation during lymphomagenesis and a possible association between p15 and p16 inactivation and aggressive transformation in B-cell and T-cell lymphomas.",

We analyzed 29 invasive primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) for p16 inactivation with immunohistochemistry utilizing a new monoclonal antibody (mAb), DCS-50. p16 staining of the primary lesions was correlated with genetic analysis including: (a) detailed microsatellite analysis of markers at the p16 locus to detect homozygous deletion; (b) sequence analysis of p16; and (c) Southern blot analysis to determine the methylation status of the 5' CpG island of p16. Twenty-four of 29 (83%) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors displayed an absence of p16 nuclear staining using immunohistochemistry. Of these 24 tumors, we found that 16 (67%) harbored homozygous deletions, 5 (21%) were methylated, 1 displayed a rearrangement at the p16 locus, and 1 displayed a frameshift mutation in exon 1. These data suggest that: (a) inactivation of the p16 tumor suppressor gene is a frequent event in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck; (b) p16 is inactivated by several distinct and exclusive events including homozygous deletion, point mutation, and promoter methylation; and (c) immunohistochemical analysis for expression of the p16 gene product is an accurate and relatively simple method for evaluating p16 gene inactivation.",

Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are associated with HNSCC tumorigenesis, including inactivation of CDKN2A, which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor, in cell lines and primary tumors by DNA methylation. Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors shows therapeutic promise for other cancers. Therefore, we investigated the ability of these agents to reactivate p16 in Tu159 HNSCC cells. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increases CDKN2A expression and slightly increases histone H3 acetylation at this gene. No reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but synergistic reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon sequential treatment of Tu159 cells with both 5-aza-dC and TSA. Silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 cells is correlated with increased methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and decreased methylation at lysine 4 relative to the upstream p15 gene promoter. Interestingly, global levels of H3-K9 methylation are decreased upon treatment with 5-aza-dC. Together these data indicate that DNA methylation is a dominant epigenetic mark for silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 tumor cells. Moreover, changes in DNA methylation can reset the histone code by impacting multiple H3 modifications.",

Furthermore G1- and G2-arrest, apoptosis and residual DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) were analyzed by the colcemid-based G1-efflux assay, propidium iodide staining, the detection of PARP cleavage, the fluorescence-based detection of caspase activity and the immunofluorescence staining of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci.;On average, the cellular radiosensitivity of the HNSCC cell lines positive for HPV and p16(INK4a) was higher as compared to the sensitivity of a panel of five HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines (SF3=0.2827 vs. 0.4455). The higher sensitivity does not result from increased apoptosis or the execution of a permanent G1-arrest, but is rather associated with both, elevated levels of residual DSBs and extensive G2-arrest.;Increased cellular radiosensitivity due to compromised DNA repair capacity is likely to contribute to the improved outcome of patients with HPV/p16(INK4a)-positive tumors when treated by radiotherapy.",

By analyzing 78 HNSCC we sought to validate the accuracy of p16(INK4A) as a reliable marker of active HPV infections in HNSCC. To this end we determined HPV DNA (HPVD) and E6*I mRNA (HPVR) expression status and correlated these results with p16(INK4A) staining. In tonsillar SCC 12/20 were HPVD+ and 12/12 of these showed active HPV infections whereas in non-tonsillar SCC 10/58 were HPVD+ and 5/10 showed active HPV infections. Thus, we prove about 8% of non-tonsillar SCC to be also correlated with HPV-associated carcinogenesis. Strikingly, 3/14 (21.4%) of tonsillar and non-tonsillar HPVD+/HPVR+ cases did not show p16(INK4A) overexpression and these cases would have been missed when applying initial p16(INK4A) staining only. However, in 13 cases negative for HPV, DNA p16(INK4A) was overexpressed. In conclusion, our data confirm tonsillar SCC to be predominantly but not only associated with active HPV infections. Furthermore, our data show that p16(INK4A) overexpression is not evident in a subgroup of HNSCC with active HPV infection. Definitive HPV data should therefore be utilized in diagnostics and treatment modalities of HPV positive and HPV negative HNSCC patients, resulting in a paradigm shift regarding these obviously different tumor entities.",

We show here that p19ARF is able to inhibit the formation of G418-resistant colonies when transfected into human and mouse cell lines expressing wild-type p53, regardless of p16 status. Moreover its amino terminal domain encoded by exon 1beta is still sufficient to obtain the same effect. We have analysed the ability of p19ARF to interfere with Ras-mediated cellular transformation in the NIH3T3 cell line. Cotransfection of p19ARF together with activated ras potently inhibited the formation of transformed foci in a dose-dependent manner. We have also isolated stable NIH3T3 transfectants expressing p19ARF and we have measured their growth properties as well as their efficiency of transformation by activated ras.

We found that RD was deleted in human cancer cell lines and pheochromocytoma tumors at frequencies of 41.2% (7/17) and 13.0% (4/31), respectively. While some of these RD deletion events occurred along with deletions of the entire INK4/ARF locus, other RD deletion events were independent of genetic alterations in p15, p14(ARF) , and p16. Furthermore, the status of RD was poorly associated with the expression of p15, p14(ARF) , and p16 in tested cancer cell lines and tumors.

We here evaluated p16 INK4A as a prognostic marker of treatment response and survival in our SCCHN patients with laryngeal, hypopharyngeal or nasopharyngeal cancers.;131 patients diagnosed with SCCHN between January 2,2006 and July 17, 2010 were examined for p16 INK4A. The median age was 60 years (15-82 years). Fifty one patients were stage I-II and 80 were stage III-IV. Immunohistochemical expression of p16 INK4A was analyzed in pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor blocks. The influence of p16 INK4A status on disease-free survival, and overall survival after treatment was evaluated.;P16 INK4A positivity was found in 58 patients (44%). Tumor-positivity for p16INK4A was correlated with improved disease free survival (70.1 months vs 59 months) and improved overall survival (2, 3 and 5-year values; 77% vs 72%, 70% vs 63% and, 63% vs 55%; respectively). On multivariate analysis, stage was determined as independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival.;Stage was the major prognostic factor on treatment response and survival in our patients.

The opioid growth factor (OGF; [Met(5)]-enkephalin) and the OGF receptor (OGFr) form an endogenous growth regulating system; the OGF-OGFr axis influences the G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle in HNSCC. Cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for OGFr no longer responded to the growth inhibitory effects of OGF or the growth stimulatory effects of naltrexone, indicating that these activities are entirely mediated by OGFr. In this investigation, we examined the precise target of OGF in the cell cycle. Using SCC-1 cells, OGF decreased the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. This change was correlated with reduced Cdk4, but not Cdk2, kinase activity. OGF treatment increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 protein expression. Importantly, p16 complexed with Cdk4 was increased by OGF treatment at all time points, consistent with the hypothesis that OGF mediated growth inhibition through p16. Blockade of OGF-OGFr interactions with naloxone abolished the increased expression of p16 protein by OGF. Inhibition of p16 (INK4a) activation by p16-specific siRNA blocked OGF's repressive action on proliferation of SCC-1, CAL-27, and SCC-4 HNSCC cells. These data are the first to reveal that the target of cell proliferative inhibitory action of OGF in human HNSCC is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory pathway, and this may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of HNSCC.",

To explore the involvement of CDKN2 in prostate carcinogenesis, alterations of CDKN2 were examined in 116 human prostate tissues and cell lines and xenografts. Markedly reduced expression of CDKN2 mRNA was found in 43% (26 of 60) of untreated primary carcinomas, whereas no alteration was observed in 10 benign prostatic hyperplasias. In 17 matched sets from individual patients, 41% of cancerous tissues in contrast to 6% of noncancerous tissues expressed low levels of CDKN2 mRNA, supporting the role of CDKN2 as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Alteration of CDKN2 was observed in each prostate tumor cell line, including one with a missense mutation, and in one of three xenograft tumor tissues derived from primary carcinomas. Two cell lines (PC-3 and TSU-Pr1) expressed only CDKN2 E1beta transcripts, indicating that the expression of CDKN2 E1alpha and E1beta are under separate control in the prostate. A high level of CDKN2 expression was related to abnormal RB1 in one primary tumor and in the DU145 cell line, which expressed the mutated CDKN2 allele. Analysis of genomic DNA indicated that altered CDKN2 expression in primary carcinomas of the prostate was more frequently due to down-regulation of transcription (five of seven) than deletion of the gene (two of seven). Additionally, CDKN2 mRNA was induced in nonexpressor cell lines by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. This study demonstrates that alteration of CDKN2 is one of the most frequent genetic abnormalities in prostate cancer and may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis.",

Recently, genetic variations have been considered as important factors to cancer susceptibility and prognosis. More specifically, genetic polymorphisms have been associated with the development and prognosis of HNSCC. The purpose of the current study was to investigate an association among p16 (CDKN2A) gene polymorphism at rs11515, age, and HNSCC aggressiveness. PCR-RFLP analysis was used to investigate the p16 (CDKN2A) gene in 96 patients with HNSCC and in 100 individuals without HNSCC. A case group was categorized by age in younger (<60 years) and older (≥ 60 years) patients. Differences between the case and control groups were determined using Fisher and chi-squared tests. Time of survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up visit or to the date of death using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and comparing this to the log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. In the present study, no association was established between HNSCC and rs11515 polymorphism, as indicated in a previous study. We found that HNSCC individuals with large-sized tumors and with metastatic disease presented worse overall survival, consistent with fundamental concepts that establish the effects of tumor size and lymph node metastasis to HNSCC outcomes. This study identified that there is no difference in the distribution of rs11515 between the control and HNSCC groups.

Derepression of the Ink4a/Arf gene locus has been largely attributed to Bmi1-deficient phenotypes in the nervous system. However, its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal remained undetermined. In this study, we show that derepressed p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) in Bmi1-deficient mice were tightly associated with a loss of self-renewing HSCs. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes substantially restored the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1(-/-) HSCs. Thus, Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical failsafe against the p16(Ink4a)- and p19(Arf)-dependent premature loss of HSCs. We further identified a novel role for Bmi1 in the organization of a functional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The BM microenvironment in Bmi1(-/-) mice appeared severely defective in supporting hematopoiesis. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes did not considerably restore the impaired BM microenvironment, leading to a sustained postnatal HSC depletion in Bmi1(-/-)Ink4a-Arf(-/-) mice. Our findings unveil a differential role of derepressed Ink4a and Arf on HSCs and their BM microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice.

However, little is known regarding the function of p15INK4B translated from the same locus. To determine the frequency of CDKN2AB loss in human mutant KRAS lung cancer, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was interrogated. Two-hit inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B occurs frequently in patients with mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, p15INK4B loss occurs in the presence of biallelic inactivation of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), suggesting that p15INK4B loss confers a selective advantage to mutant KRAS lung cancers that are p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) deficient. To determine the significance of CDKN2AB loss in vivo, genetically engineered lung cancer mouse models that express mutant Kras in the respiratory epithelium were utilized. Importantly, complete loss of CDKN2AB strikingly accelerated mutant Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis, leading to loss of differentiation, increased metastatic disease, and decreased overall survival. Primary mutant Kras lung epithelial cells lacking Cdkn2ab had increased clonogenic potential. Furthermore, comparative analysis of mutant Kras;Cdkn2a null with Kras;Cdkn2ab null mice and experiments with mutant KRAS;CDKN2AB-deficient human lung cancer cells indicated that p15INK4B is a critical tumor suppressor. Thus, the loss of CDKN2AB is of biologic significance in mutant KRAS lung tumorigenesis by fostering cellular proliferation, cancer cell differentiation, and metastatic behavior.;These findings indicate that mutant Kras;Cdkn2ab null mice provide a platform for accurately modeling aggressive lung adenocarcinoma and testing therapeutic modalities.",

Human ARF is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene, mainly in association with the simultaneous deletion of INK4A. However, questions remain as to whether loss of ARF alone is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis. Here, we report that mice deficient for Arf are susceptible to accelerated asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma (MM). MMs arising in Arf (+/-) mice consistently exhibit biallelic inactivation of Arf, but, unexpectedly, do not acquire additional recurrent genetic alterations that we previously identified in asbestos-induced MMs arising in Nf2 (+/-) mice. Array CGH analysis was used to detect a recurrent deletion at chromosome 4C6 in MMs from Arf (+/-) mice. A candidate gene in this region, Faf1 (FAS-associated factor 1), was further explored, because it encodes a protein implicated in tumor cell survival and in the pathogenesis of some human tumor types. We confirmed hemizygous loss of Faf1 and down-regulation of Faf1 protein in a series of MMs from Arf (+/-) mice, and we then showed that Faf1 regulates TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB signaling, a pathway previously implicated in asbestos-induced oncogenesis of human mesothelial cells. Collectively, these data indicate that Arf inactivation has a significant role in driving MM pathogenesis, and implicate Faf1 as a key component in the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling node that has now been independently implicated in asbestos-induced oncogenesis.",

Increased expression of the Ink4a/Arf locus, which encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a) and tumor suppressor p19(Arf), limits beta-cell regeneration in aging mice, but the basis of beta-cell Ink4a/Arf regulation is poorly understood. Here we show that Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), a histone methyltransferase and component of a Polycomb group (PcG) protein complex, represses Ink4a/Arf in islet beta cells. Ezh2 levels decline in aging islet beta cells, and this attrition coincides with reduced histone H3 trimethylation at Ink4a/Arf, and increased levels of p16(INK4a) and p19(Arf). Conditional deletion of beta-cell Ezh2 in juvenile mice also reduced H3 trimethylation at the Ink4a/Arf locus, leading to precocious increases of p16(INK4a) and p19(Arf). These mutant mice had reduced beta-cell proliferation and mass, hypoinsulinemia, and mild diabetes, phenotypes rescued by germline deletion of Ink4a/Arf. beta-Cell destruction with streptozotocin in controls led to increased Ezh2 expression that accompanied adaptive beta-cell proliferation and re-establishment of beta-cell mass; in contrast, mutant mice treated similarly failed to regenerate beta cells, resulting in lethal diabetes. Our discovery of Ezh2-dependent beta-cell proliferation revealed unique epigenetic mechanisms underlying normal beta-cell expansion and beta-cell regenerative failure in diabetes pathogenesis.",

The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14(ARF) and p16. We now show that p14(ARF) (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REGγ. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knockdown of REGγ or by pharmacologic blockade of its nuclear export. Thus, our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of 2 key tumor suppressors mediated by a REGγ-dependent mechanism. The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell-cycle function.;The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell cycle function.

Altered gene expression during cellular senescence is numerous compared to that of younger proliferative cells in culture. We have previously reported that the levels and activities of hnRNP A1 and A2 RNA binding proteins are decreased in senescent human fibroblasts. Both proteins are multifunctional and may influence the expression of mRNA isoforms during development. In this study, we tested whether overexpression of either protein could modulate the mRNA isoforms of the INK4a locus, specifically p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a). Both INK4a mRNA isoforms have been shown to be growth suppressors and deletions of this locus allow cells to escape cellular senescence. We have found that increasing the ratio of either hnRNP A1 or A2 over that of splicing factor SF2/ASF results in the preferential generation of the p14(ARF) isoform. Overexpression of A1 or A2 RNA binding proteins also appear to increase the steady state mRNA levels of both isoforms, suggesting that in addition to alternative splicing, A1 and A2 may effect p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) mRNA stability. A constitutive decrease in the ratio of hnRNP A1 or A2 to SF2/ASF in senescent fibroblasts is typically accompanied by an increase in the level of p16(INK4a) isoform.

Normalizing miRNA-31 levels, either using a specific inhibitor or by restoration of the nuclear lamina, also normalizes cell cycle distribution and cell proliferation rates. We show that the 3'UtR of p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) has a functional miRNA-31 binding site which contributes to the observed regulation of cell cycle progression. Our findings are the first demonstration that the nuclear envelope can control gene expression by regulating specific miRNA levels, and that miRNA-31 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and progress through the cell cycle at least in part by regulating the levels of p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf).",

HPV-positive HNSCC preferentially affect the oropharynx and tonsils. Localized HPV-positive HNSCCs have a favorable prognosis and treatment outcome. However, the impact of HPV in advanced or metastatic HNSCC remains to be defined. In particular, it is unclear whether HPV modulates the response to cetuximab, an antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a mainstay of treatment of advanced HNSCC. To this end, we have examined the sensitivity of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC models to cetuximab and cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have stably expressed the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 in cetuximab-sensitive cancer cell lines to specifically investigate their role in the antibody response. The endogenous HPV status or the expression of HPV oncogenes had no significant impact on cetuximab-mediated suppression of EGFR signaling and proliferation in vitro. Cetuximab effectively inhibited the growth of E6- and E7-expressing tumors grafted in NOD/SCID mice. In support, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from cetuximab-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC were probed for p16(INK4a) expression, an established biomarker of HPV infection. Response rates (45.5% versus 45.5%) and median progression-free survival (97 versus 92 days) following cetuximab-based therapy were similar in patients with p16(INK4A)-positive and p16(INK4A)-negative tumors. In conclusion, HPV oncogenes do not modulate the anti-EGFR antibody response in HSNCC. Cetuximab treatment should be administered independently of HPV status. ",

To study the contribution of each pathway to the carcinogenesis of Barrett's adenocarcinoma, we analysed the alterations of p14ARF and p16INK4a in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of this disease.;After microdissection, DNA of 15 Barrett's adenocarcinomas, 40 Barrett's intraepithelial neoplasms (n=20 low- and n=20 high-grade) and 15 Barrett's mucosa without neoplasia was analysed for INK4-ARF inactivation using DNA sequence and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, restriction-enzyme-related polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.;We detected 9p21 LOH, p16INK4a methylation and p16INK4a mutations in Barrett's adenocarcinomas in 5 of 15 (33%), 8 of 15 (53%) and 1 of 15 (7%) patients, respectively. P14ARF was methylated in 3 of 15 (20%) adenocarcinomas. In Barrett's intraepithelial neoplasia, p16INK4a was altered in 12 of 20 (60%) high-grade and in 4 of 20 (20%) low-grade intraepithelial neoplasms. In Barrett's mucosa without intraepithelial neoplasia p16(INK4a) was methylated in one case (7%). P14ARF was intact in Barrett's mucosa without intraepithelial neoplasia.;We conclude that most Barrett's intraepithelial neoplasms contain genetic and/or epigenetic INK4a-ARF alterations. Methylation of p16INK4a appears to be the most frequent epigenetic defect in the neoplastic progression of Barrett's tumourigenesis.",

The great majority of HPV-related primaries originate in the oropharynx. p16INKa (p16) functions as a surrogate marker of HPV infection. We sought to determine if expression of p16 by immunocytochemistry (ICC) in neck metastases could assist in localizing the primary site to the oropharynx.;Diagnostic FNA cytology smears of neck metastases from 90 patients with biopsy-proven primary HNSCC were reviewed. Papanicolaou-stained slides were directly subjected to ICC, using p16 antibody.;Twenty-seven (30%) tumors expressed p16 by ICC; 74% of these p16-positive tumors were metastases from oropharynx. There was a significantly higher proportion of p16 expression in patients with primary oropharyngeal carcinoma (47%) versus those whose primary tumor was non-oropharyngeal (15%; p = 0.0013).;p16 expression in FNA cytology smears of metastatic HNSCC is a useful indicator of oropharyngeal origin and can be used to help localize the primary site in cases where this is not clinically evident.",

All tissues, obtained at the time of hysterectomy, were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were made for hematoxylin and eosin staining and for immunohistochemistry. Although a previous PCR study has demonstrated that none of these neoplasms showed any signal for HPV DNA, these malignancies did display immunoreactivity for P16(INK4a). In ESCC, P16(INK4a) immunoreactivity was diffuse in 100% of neoplastic cells. In two cases of EMMA, positivity for P16INK4a was zonal. In ETCC, scattered cells were positive for P16INK4a protein. These findings suggest that alteration of p16 could play an etiologic role, without any association to HPV infections, in these rare endometrial carcinomas.

Sixty-five cases of primary colorectal adenocarcinoma with a series of clinicopathological parameters were obtained. We performed methylation-specific PCR of p16INK4a and p14ARF genes in colorectal cancer paraffin blocks with its paired normal samples, as well as immunohistochemical stainings for p16 and p53, and MI analysis. Aberrant methylations of p16INK4a and p14ARF gene were present in 21 (32.3%) and 33 (50.8%) out of 65 cases, respectively. p16INK4a aberrant methylation was correlated with p16 negativity (P=0.021) and p53 overexpression (P=0.007). p16INK4a aberrant methylation was more frequently present in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (P=0.002). Aberrant methylation of p14ARF gene occurred more frequently in patients under 50 years of age and in left-sided colon cancers, and was not statistically significant. Compared with the group with simultaneous absence of methylation in both promoters, the group showing concomitant alterations in both p16INK4a and p14ARF genes (n=10) more frequently presented lymph node metastasis (P=0.020) and higher tumor grade (P=0.014).

Although it is now well established that p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) act as tumour suppressor genes, the role of p15(INK4b) remains to be well defined. In order to explore the possibility of a selective deregulation of p15(INK4b) in human lung carcinogenesis, we studied p15(INK4b) status in neuroendocrine (NE) lung tumours where homozygous deletions of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) locus are rarely observed. Expressions of p15 and p15.5 protein isoforms were analysed in a series of eight control normal lung, 12 tumour-associated normal lung, five low grade and 15 high grade neuroendocrine (NE) lung tumours and relationship with a specific p15(INK4b) methylation status was studied. Using Western blot analysis, we showed that p15 and p15.5 isoforms displayed a high heterogeneous pattern of expression in both normal and tumour tissues. P15 and p15.5 expressions were correlated in control normal lung (P<0.04) whereas they were not in tumours and associated normal lung. The level of p15.5 was significantly higher in associated normal lung and in tumours (P<0.02 respectively), specially in low grade tumours (P<0.01), than in control normal lung. Furthermore, p15.5 expression was more variable in tumours than in normal lung (P<0.01) and in low grade than in high grade NE lung tumours (P<0.02). Levels of p15 and p15.5 were distinct (up- or downregulated) from those observed in paired normal lung in 4/12 (33%) and 10/12 (83%) tumours respectively. Aberrant methylation at the 5' end of p15(INK4b) gene was observed in 15% of NE lung tumours using PCR-based assay, in a region proximal to the translation start where methylation did not occur in control and associated normal lung. However, no correlation could be assessed with protein status. MSP analysis of CpG islands proximal to the transcription start revealed methylation in all normal and tumour samples. No correlation was found between p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a) or p14(ARF) status.

Although p15INK4b, p18INK4c and p19INK4d were demonstrated in many tissues by 4 weeks after birth, p16INK4a protein expression was restricted to the lung and spleen of older mice, with increased, more widespread mRNA expression during aging. Transcripts encoding the INK4a alternative reading frame product p19ARF were not detected before birth but were ubiquitous postnatally. Expression of p16INK4a and p15INK4b was induced when mouse embryos were disrupted and cultured as mouse embryo 'fibroblasts' (MEFs). The levels of p16INK4a and p18INK4c, but not p15INK4b or p19INK4d, further increased as MEFs approached senescence. Following crisis and establishment, three of four independently-derived cell lines became polyploid and expressed higher levels of functional p16INK4a. In contrast, one MEF line that sustained bi-allelic deletions of INK4a initially remained diploid. Therefore, loss of p16INK4a and other events predisposing to polyploidy may represent alternative processes contributing to cell immortalization.

        "Doc_abstract":"Chemically induced skin carcinomas in mice are a paradigm for epithelial neoplasia, where oncogenic ras mutations precede p53 and INK4a/ARF mutations during the progression toward malignancy. To explore the biological basis for these genetic interactions, we studied cellular responses to oncogenic ras in primary murine keratinocytes. In wild-type keratinocytes, ras induced a cell-cycle arrest that displayed some features of terminal differentiation and was accompanied by increased expression of the p19(ARF), p16(INK4a), and p53 tumor suppressors. In ARF-null keratinocytes, ras was unable to promote cell-cycle arrest, induce differentiation markers, or properly activate p53. Although oncogenic ras produced a substantial increase in both nucleolar and nucleoplasmic p19(ARF), Mdm2 did not relocalize to the nucleolus or to nuclear bodies but remained distributed throughout the nucleoplasm. This result suggests that p19(ARF) can activate p53 without overtly affecting Mdm2 subcellular localization. Nevertheless, like p53-null keratinocytes, ARF-null keratinocytes were transformed by oncogenic ras and rapidly formed carcinomas in vivo. Thus, oncogenic ras can activate the ARF-p53 program to suppress epithelial cell transformation. Disruption of this program may be important during skin carcinogenesis and the development of other carcinomas.",

All the affected tumor samples were of favorable histology. Methylation-specific PCR revealed that methylation in the p16 promoter region may be responsible for altered expression. The incidence of loss of p16 expression may increase with increasing tumor stage, i.e., 1/10 (10%) with stage I/II FH Wilms tumor, 2/10 (20%) with stage III FH Wilms tumor, and 4/10 (40%) with stage IV FH Wilms tumor.

HPV-16 is the predominant type and exists in episomal, integrated, or mixed forms. Tonsillar carcinomas have a remarkably higher viral load than carcinomas at other sites of the head and neck region. HPV-16 DNA has also been detected in tumour-free tonsils. Infection by oncogenic HPVs is a necessary but not a sufficient cause of cancers. Studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying HPV-associated carcinogenesis are difficult, because HPV is not easy to propagate in vitro.

In the present study, p16(INK4a) methylation was evaluated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using a quantitative assay and the clinical significance of the methylation was explored.;A total of 244 tumor samples from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archives were examined in this study. p16(INK4a) methylation was analyzed by the fluorescence-based, real-time methylation-specific PCR assay, MethyLight. The quantitative methylation value was expressed as the percentage of methylated reference (PMR).;The median level of p16(INK4) methylation was 0.55 PMR (range 0.00-503.4). The p16(INK4) methylation value was significantly higher in males (p = 0.005) and in squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.018). Prognostic analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model showed that the p16(INK4a) methylation value was a significant prognostic factor (odds ratio, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.008; p < 0.0001). The p16(INK4a) methylation value remained a significant prognostic factor (p = 0.0004) in multivariate analysis including age, gender, histological type and clinical stage. Specimens were then classified into hypermethylated or non-hypermethylated groups based on the p16(INK4a) methylation value using various cut-offs from 1 to 100 PMR. There was no significant difference in prognosis between the two groups using a cut-off value of 1 PMR. On the other hand, there was a significant difference using 6 PMR or more as the cut-off value (p < 0.01).;These results provide clear evidence for the prognostic significance of p16(INK4a) methylation in NSCLC using quantitative DNA methylation analysis. Careful assessment of DNA methylation is needed because qualitative methylation analysis may overestimate low levels of methylation, which have less clinical significance.",

C/EBPbeta is required for premature senescence of primary mouse fibroblasts induced by expression of H-Ras(V12), demonstrating its role in oncogene-induced senescence. Here, we have investigated the mechanisms by which Ras inhibits proliferation of normal cells but transforms immortalized cells. We show that oncogenic Ras down-regulates C/EBPbeta expression in NIH 3T3 cells, which are immortalized by a deletion of the CDKN2A locus and, therefore, lack the p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) tumor suppressors. Ras(V12)-induced silencing of C/EBPbeta occurred at the mRNA level and involved both the Raf-mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase-ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways. Oncogenic Ras decreased C/EBPbeta expression in Ink4a/Arf(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) but increased C/EBPbeta levels in wild-type MEFs. C/EBPbeta down-regulation in NIH 3T3 cells was reversed by expression of p19(Arf), but not of p53 or p16(Ink4a), highlighting a critical role for p19(Arf) in sustaining C/EBPbeta levels. Ectopic expression of p34 C/EBPbeta (LAP) inhibited Ras(V12)-mediated transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, suppressed their tumorigenicity in nude mice, and reactivated expression of the proapoptotic Fas receptor, which is also down-regulated by Ras. Our findings indicate that Cebpb gene silencing eliminates a growth inhibitory transcription factor that would otherwise restrain oncogenesis. We propose that C/EBPbeta is part of a p53-independent, p19(Arf)-mediated network that enforces Ras-induced cell cycle arrest and tumor suppression in primary fibroblasts.",

Moreover, the p16 beta transcript theoretically encodes a protein distinct from p16 derived from a divergent reading frame putatively initiated in exon 1 beta. To test the contribution of both of these transcripts in carcinogenesis, full-length cDNA of p16 and p16 beta were cloned in separate vector constructs and then transfected into HNSCC cell lines characterized for p16 status (p16[+/+], p16[mut/-], and p16[methylated]). Transfection of either p16 or p16 beta resulted in marked growth inhibition in all three HNSCC lines tested, regardless of p16 status. However, p16 beta but not p16 inhibited the growth of HeLa cells, a cell line with inactive pRB due to expression of E7 papillomavirus protein. Moreover, transfection of all three HNSCC lines with either p16 or p16 beta resulted in a marked increase in cells in G0-G1 consistent with a cell cycle arrest in G1. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that p16 and p16 beta are growth-inhibitory genes active in HNSCC and that both act by blocking progression through the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of p16 beta on HeLa growth suggest that p16 beta mediates its effect independently from pRB.",

We investigated their role in the pathogenesis of 9 bile tract cancer cell lines and 21 primary sporadic extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas. p53 and p16 protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Mutation screening of p53 was done by SSCP and direct sequencing. Inactivating mechanisms of p14 and p16 were addressed by screening for mutations, homozygous deletions, chromosomal loss of 9p21 (loss of heterozygosity [LOH] analysis) and promoter hypermethylation of the p14/p16 genes. p53 overexpression could be detected in 7 of 9 cell lines and 7 of 21 primary tumors, but mutations were found in 3 cell lines only. p16 expression was absent in all cell lines, due to homozygous deletion of the gene in 8 of 9 cell lines and hypermethylation of the p16 promoter in one cell line (CC-LP-1). p14 exon 1beta was homozygously deleted in 6 of 9 cell lines, while retained in CC-LP-1 and 2 additional lines. No p14 promoter hypermethylation could be detected. p16 expression was lost in 11 of 21 primary tumors. p16 promoter hypermethylation was present in 9 of 21 primary tumors, all with lost p16 expression. Allelic loss at 9p21 was detected in 13 of 21 primary tumors, 10 of 11 with lost p16 expression and 8 of 9 with methylated p16 promoter. No p14 promoter hypermethylation or p14/p16 mutations could be detected. Neither Tp53 nor p16 alterations showed obvious association with histopathologic or clinical characteristics. In conclusion, inactivation of the p16 gene is a frequent event in primary sporadic extrahepatic bile duct cancers, 9p21 LOH and promoter hypermethylation being the principal inactivating mechanisms. Therefore, p16, but not p14, seems to be the primary target of inactivation at the INK4a locus in bile duct cancers. Other mechanisms than Tp53 mutations seems to be predominantly responsible for stabilization of nuclear p53 protein in bile duct cancers.",

DNA hypermethylation profiles differ significantly by HPV status suggesting that a specific subset of methylated CpG loci could give mechanistic insight into HPV-driven OPSCC. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation of primary tumor samples and adjacent normal mucosa from 46 OPSCC patients undergoing treatment at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 beadchip. For each matched tissue set, we measured differentially methylated CpG loci using a change in methylation level (M value). From these analyses, we identified a 22 CpG loci panel for HPV+ OPSCC that included four CDKN2A loci downstream of the p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) transcription start sites. This panel was significantly associated with overall HPV detection (P < 0.05; ROC area under the curve = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.0) similar to the subset of four CDKN2A-specific CpG loci (0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.99) with equivalence to the full 22 CpG panel. DNA hypermethylation correlated with a significant increase in alternative open reading frame (ARF) expression in HPV+ OPSCC primary tumors, but not to the other transcript variant encoded by the CDKN2A locus.

Data were evaluated with the use of the exact unconditional test derived from Fisher's test. All statistical tests were two-sided.;Eight of 28 XP-associated tumors had mutations in the INK4a-ARF locus. Three XP-associated tumors had multiple mutations at this locus. In all, 13 mutations in the INK4a-ARF locus were detected in XP-associated tumors, of which seven (54%) were signature UV radiation-induced mutations, i.e., tandem CC : GG-->TT : AA transitions. p53 mutations, mostly of the type induced by UV radiation, were present in 12 tumors (43%).

Recently, two genes, p16INK4a and p15INK4b, encoding two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins of the INK4 family of Mr 15,000 and 16,000, respectively, have been localized to 9p21. Remarkably, the p16INK4a locus has been found to encode a second protein, p14ARF, known as p19ARF in mice, with a distinct reading frame. Like p16INK4a, p14ARF is involved in cell cycle regulation, blocking cells at the G1 restriction point through the activity of MDM-2 and p53. We studied bone marrow samples of 42 newly diagnosed and untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia for the incidence of deletions of p16INK4a/p14ARF and p15INK4b using Southern blot analysis and determined the clinical outcome with regard to complete remission (CR) duration, event-free survival, and overall survival. We found deletions of p16INK4a/p14ARF in 17 of 42 patients (40%), with homozygous deletions in 11 of 42 patients (26%) and hemizygous deletions in 6 of 42 patients (14%). The gene for p15INK4b was codeleted in most, but not all, cases and was never deleted without deletion of p16INK4a/ p14ARF. No correlation was observed between molecular studies and karyotype abnormalities as determined by conventional cytogenetics. Furthermore, no difference was found in the CR rate, CR duration, event-free survival, and overall survival in patients with homozygous gene deletions compared to patients with no deletions or loss of only one allele.",

In mice, downregulation of one of the polycomb genes, bmi-1, leads to neurological alterations and severe proliferative defects in lymphoid cells, whilst bmi-1 overexpression, together with upregulation of myc-1, induces lymphoma. An oncogenic function has been further supported in primary fibroblast studies where bmi-1 overexpression induces immortalization due to repression of p16/p19ARF, and where together with H-ras, it readily transforms MEFs. It was the aim of this study to assess the expression of bmi-1 in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in association with p16 and p14ARF (=human p19ARF). Tumours (48 resectable NSCLC (32 squamous, 9 adeno-, 2 large cell, 4 undifferentiated carcinomas and 1 carcinoid); stage I, 29, II, 7, III, 12; T1, 18, T2, 30; differentiation: G1 12, G2 19, G3 17) were studied by immunohistochemistry for protein expression and by comparative multiplex PCR for gene amplification analysis. In tumour-free, normal lung tissue from patients, weak - moderate bmi-1 staining was seen in some epithelial cells, lymphocytes, glandular cells and in fibroblasts, whereas blood, endothelial, chondrocytes, muscle cells and adipocytes did not exhibit any bmi-1 expression. In tumours, malignant cells were negative/weakly, moderately and strongly positive in 20, 22 and 6 cases, respectively. As assessed by multiplex PCR, bmi-1 gene amplification was not the reason for high-level bmi-1 expression. Tumours with moderate or strong bmi-1 expression were more likely to have low levels of p16 and p14ARF (P = 0.02). Similarly, tumours negative for both, p16 and p14ARF, exhibit moderate-strong bmi-1 staining. 58% of resectable NSCLC exhibit moderate-high levels of bmi-1 protein. The inverse correlation of bmi-1 and the INK4 locus proteins expression (p16/p14ARF) supports a possible role for bmi-1 misregulation in lung carcinogenesis.",

To analyze the mechanism of these chromosomal events, we used cloning, sequencing, and/or polymerase chain reaction mapping to study 15 rearrangements occurring in the MTS1 locus. We found that these breakpoints occur in two clusters (MTS1(bcralpha) and MTS1(bcrbeta) ). The three rearrangements occurring in MTS1(bcralpha) correspond to a recurrent recombination juxtaposing 5' MTS2 exon 1 and 5' MTS1 exon 1alpha sequences. Breakpoints for 10 of 12 rearrangements within MTS1(bcrbeta) are located at a polymorphic (CA) repeat, suggesting that this sequence might play a role in the clustering. For both MTS1(bcralpha) and MTS1(bcrbeta), sequence analyses and PCR mapping experiments show that the tightly clustered breakpoints are located in the vicinity of heptamers whose sequence is similar to those involved in the V(D)J recombination. Moreover, short deletions, GC-rich random nucleotide additions, and clone-specific junctional sequences are present in all cases, further suggesting that the rearrangements are due to illegitimate V(D)J recombinase activity. These data are the first demonstration that a tumor suppressor gene can be inactivated by the V(D)J recombinational mechanism. Moreover, they reinforce the view that this process, normally required for T-cell differentiation, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL.",

Many genes that regulate the critical cell cycle checkpoint at G1S are altered in human tumors. These genetic changes can result in uncontrolled cellular proliferation, genetic instability, and altered response to radiation and chemotherapy. The p53 tumor suppressor gene serves a critical role at the G1S transition, where it can either block entry into S phase or activate programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to DNA damage. p53 Gene mutations are common in human tumors and interfere with the activation of apoptosis in response to most chemotherapeutic agents. Paclitaxel is a potent chemotherapeutic agent that interferes with mitotic spindle function to block cells at G2M, the most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle. Utilization of paclitaxel as a radiation sensitizer in vivo to treat aggressive, locally advanced neoplasms has resulted in high response rates and acceptable toxicity in protocols for non-small cell lung carcinoma, upper gastrointestinal tract carcinoma, and other malignancies. Recent evidence suggests that paclitaxel is unique in its ability to activate apoptosis in tumor cells with p53 mutations in vitro and in vivo. The p16(INK4a) (MTS-1, CDKN2) gene product acts in the same pathway as p53 to inhibit cell cycle progression at G1/S. p16(INK4a) is deleted and/or mutated in a significant fraction of human tumors, including pancreatic carcinoma. The effects of p16(INK4a) alterations in response to paclitaxel/radiation and the risk of systemic relapse are currently being evaluated. Information about molecular genetic alterations in individual tumors ultimately may be a critical factor in choosing between therapeutic options.",

Molecular analyses of the p16 gene locus in blood and tumor DNA from this family was performed to determine whether an association between germline p16 gene mutation and HNSCC exists.;Molecular pedigree analyses.;Exon 2 of p16 was polymerase chain reaction amplified from blood, tumor, or nontumor DNA isolated from affected and unaffected members, then directly sequenced and compared with consensus p16 sequence. Cell cycle position of cells expressing wild-type or mutant p16 was determined by flow cytometry.;Molecular analyses revealed a nonfunctional germline point mutation within exon 2 of the p16 gene that encodes a mutant p16 protein substituting proline at amino acid position 87 for the wild-type arginine (p16R87P). Relative to wild-type p16, p16R87P lost ability to cause a growth arrest following ectopic expression. The mutant (p16R87P) allele segregated with cancer predisposition in tested family members, and analyses of HNSCC tumor tissues demonstrated universal loss of wild-type allele.;Significance of the mutant p16 (p16R87P) in HNSCC tumorigenesis is strongly suggested by its loss of cell cycle arrest activity and its retention in tumor tissue with simultaneous loss of the wild-type allele. Further, the germline p16 mutation segregated with cancer predisposition within the family. In aggregate, these data suggest that there is a direct causal relationship between the germline p16 mutation in this family and HNSCC tumorigenesis.

We show here that a subset of these kindreds possess a G-->T transversion at base -34 of CDKN2A, designated G-34T. This mutation gives rise to a novel AUG translation initiation codon that decreases translation from the wild-type AUG.

The reactivation of telomerase activity and losses or gains of specific chromosomal regions, which point to deletions of tumor suppressor genes or amplification of oncogenes are supposed to be the molecular processes during the development and progression of head and neck cancer. Therefore, we analyzed telomerase activity and microsatellite markers using a genome wide panel of 28 microsatellite markers in 38 head and neck squamous-cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Our microsatellite marker set included distinct chromosomal areas that all likely harbor genes contributing to the carcinogenesis of HNSCC. DNA or protein lysates were obtained from primary tumors and compared to peripheral lymphocytes or corresponding normal tissue. At least one genomic alteration [loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or microsatellite instability (MSI)] was found in 31 of the 38 cases (82%). Most frequently we detected an LOH in the chromosomal region 9p12-21 where at least the tumor suppressor genes (TSG) p16INK4A, p14ARF and p15INKB are localized. The comparison between grade two and grade three tumors showed a highly changed frequency of LOH in the chromosomal region 7q31, where a putative TSG is predicted. Telomerase activity was present in 31/37 (83.8%) tumor samples independent of the histopathological staging and grading of the tumors.

The second growth phase, referred to as post-selection, follows a period of temporary growth arrest and is characterized by the absence of p16(INK4a) (also known as CDK4I and p16-INK4a) expression. Previously, we observed that post-selection HMECs have elevated levels of p53. Exogenous p16(INK4a) expression decreased levels of both p53 transcript and protein, and this effect was inhibited by nutlin-3a, indicating that p16(INK4a) can regulate p53 expression by affecting both p53 transcription and Mdm2-dependent degradation of p53. The p53 in post-selection HMECs was wild type and, as expected, increased p53 expression was associated with elevated p21(WAF1/CIP1) and Mdm2 levels; the p53 response to DNA damage seemed normal. Despite elevated levels of wild-type p53 and p21(WAF1/CIP1), post-selection cells grew more rapidly than their pre-selection HMEC precursors. We found that the post-selection HMECs contain a truncated Mdm2 protein (p60), which presumably lacks the p53 ubiquitylation domain. We propose that the increased levels of p53 in post-selection HMECs are due to the presence of an Mdm2 fragment that binds p53 but does not result in its degradation.",

Epigenetic alterations involved in the onset and progression of breast cancer may serve as biomarkers for early detection and prediction of disease prognosis. Furthermore, using body fluids such as serum offers a non-invasive method to procure multiple samples for biomarker analyses. The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between methylation status of multiple cancer genes, p16(INK4A), p14(ARF), Cyclin D2 and Slit2 in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and paired serum DNA and clinicopathological parameters. Of the 36 breast cancer patients investigated, 31 (86%) tumors and 30 (83%) paired sera showed methylation of at least one of these 4 genes. Methylation frequencies varied from 27% for CyclinD2, 44% for p16(INK4A), 47% for p14(ARF) to 58% for Slit2. There was concordance between DNA methylation in tumor and paired serum DNA of each gene. This study underscores the potential utility of DNA methylation based screening of serum as a surrogate marker for tumor DNA methylation status of these genes in breast cancer. Further, expression profile of p16(INK4A) could be linked to epigenetic events, thus suggesting this pathway as a potential target for therapeutic strategies based on reversal of epigenetic silencing.",

We employed genetic and pharmacologic approaches to study the interplay among Ink4 proteins and cdk4/6 activity in vivo.

The initiation of prostate malignancy and progression to a castration-resistant stage are largely contributed by the modulation of AR activity through its coregulatory proteins. We and others previously reported that p14 alternative reading frame (ARF) expression is positively correlated with the disease progression and severity of PCa. Here, we provide evidence that p14ARF physically interacts with AR and functions as an AR corespressor in both an androgen-dependent and androgen-independent manner. Endogenous ARF (p14ARF in human and p19ARF in mouse) and AR colocalize in both human PCa cells in vitro and PCa tissues of mouse and human in vivo. Overexpression of p14ARF in PCa cells significantly attenuates the activities of androgen response region (ARR2)-probasin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoters. The forced expression of p14ARF in cells resulted in a suppression of PSA and NK transcription factor locus 1 (NKX3.1) expression. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous p14ARF in human PCa cells with short hairpin RNA enhanced AR transactivation activities in a dose-dependent and p53-independent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p14ARF binds to both the N-terminal domain and the ligand-binding domain of AR, and the human double minute 2 (HDM2)-binding motif of p14ARF is required for the interaction of p14ARF and AR proteins. p14ARF perturbs the androgen-induced interaction between the N terminus and C terminus of AR. Most importantly, we observed that the expression of PSA is reversely correlated with p14ARF in human prostate tissues. Taken together, our results reveal a novel function of ARF in modulation of AR transactivation in PCa.",

Recent evidence has shown that P14ARF binds to MDM2 leading to an increased availability of wild type TP53 protein. Functional studies also support a putative tumor suppressor gene function for p14ARF suggesting that p14ARF or p53 inactivation may be functionally equivalent in tumorigenesis. To study the relative contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis, we analysed and compared alterations of the p16, p14ARF and p53 genes in 38 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (19 adenocarcinomas and 19 squamous carcinoma). The p16 tumor suppressor gene was inactivated in 22 of 38 (58%) tumors. Twelve of these samples (31%) had homozygous deletions by microsatellite analysis; eight of them (21%) had p16 promoter hypermethylation detected by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) and the remaining two (5%) harbored a point mutation in exon 2 by sequence analysis. The absence of P16 protein in every case was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Fourteen of the 22 tumors with p16 inactivation also inactivated the p14ARF gene (12 with homozygous deletions extending into INK4a/ARF and two with exon 2 mutations). Mutations of p53 were found in 18 (47%) of the tumors and nine of them (50%) harbored p14ARF inactivation. Thus, an inverse correlation was not found between p14ARF and p53 genetic alterations (P=0.18; Fisher Exact Test). Our data confirm that the p16 gene is frequently inactivated in NSCLC. Assuming that 9p deletion occurs first, the common occurrence of p53 and p14ARF alterations suggests that p14ARF inactivation is not functionally equivalent to abrogation of the TP53 pathway by p53 mutation.",

This gene also encodes a second protein product (human p16beta, murine p19ARF), which originates from an unrelated exon of CDKN2A (exon 1beta) spliced onto exon 2 in an alternate reading frame. Cell cycle arrest by p16beta is caused by an as yet unidentified pathway. In order to test the candidacy of p16beta as a glioma suppressor, we replaced p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b) and p16beta wild-type as well as a series of seven glioma-derived p16beta alleles (R87H, A112V, R120H, A121V, G125R, A128A and A128V), into glioma cell lines that had either CDKN2A-/RB+ (U-87MG and U-251MG) or CDKN2A+/RB- (LN-319) endogenous backgrounds and demonstrated that p16beta can act as a functional glioma cell growth suppressor. Moreover, p16beta, but not p16(INK4a) or p15(INK4b) inhibited the growth of RB-negative LN-319 cells, indicating that p16beta likely exerts its effects through an RB-independent pathway. In vitro and in vivo assays of pRB phosphorylation were consistent with this interpretation. Since none of the glioma-derived p16beta mutations inactivated their growth suppressive activities, it appears that mutations in CDKN2A exon 2 (which is shared in the coding sequences of p16(INK4a) and p16beta) likely exclusively target p16(INK4a).",

Kinetic metabolic labeling of cells with [3H]-leucine indicated that p19Arf is a relatively stable protein (half-life approximately 6 h) whose degradation depends upon the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Although p19Arf binds to the Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase to activate p53, neither of these molecules regulates p19Arf turnover. In contrast, the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin/B23, which binds to p19Arf with high stoichiometry, retards its turnover, and Arf mutants that do not efficiently associate with nucleophosmin/B23 are unstable and functionally impaired. Mouse p19Arf, although highly basic (22% arginine content), contains only a single lysine residue absent from human p14ARF, and substitution of arginine for lysine in mouse p19Arf had no effect on its rate of degradation. Mouse p19Arf (either wild-type or lacking lysine) and human p14ARF undergo N-terminal polyubiquitination, a process that has not as yet been documented in naturally occurring lysine-less proteins.

        "Doc_abstract":"The p16(INK4a) protein inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4, a key regulator of progression through the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region is an important avenue for inactivation of p16. The mechanism of methylation of the p16 promoter region, however, has not been elucidated. Recent reports investigating p16 methylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) suggest that carcinogens in tobacco smoke induce the DNA methylation process. We investigated the association between methylation of the p16 promoter region and exposure to tobacco smoke in 185 primary NSCLCS: We also studied the relationship of p16 methylation with mutation of the K-ras and p53 genes, as well as with methylation at the DAP-kinase and p14(ARF) loci. Finally, we evaluated the prognostic significance of p16 methylation in NSCLC. The prevalence of p16 methylation was greater in squamous cell carcinoma (41%) compared with adenocarcinoma (22%; P = 0.03; Fisher's exact test). Methylation of p16 was significantly associated with pack-years smoked (P = 0.007; Wilcoxon rank sum test), duration of smoking (P = 0.0009; Wilcoxon rank sum test), and negatively with the time since quitting smoking (P = 0.03; Wilcoxon rank sum test). No methylation of the nearby p14(ARF) locus was detected, and methylation of the DAP-kinase locus was not associated with either p16 methylation or with exposure to tobacco smoke. In patients with stage 1 adenocarcinoma, p16 methylation was an independent risk factor predicting significantly shorter postsurgery survival (P = 0.03), controlling for the significant effects of other factors, including K-ras mutation. These findings suggest that methylation of CpG islands in tobacco-associated cancers occurs in a gene- and tissue-specific manner and is induced directly or indirectly by exposure to tobacco smoke in NSCLC.",

Recently, we reported loss of heterozygosity of the region in which p16(INK4a) is located in more than one-half of primary breast tumors. However, mutational analysis of these same tumors revealed mutation of p16(INK4a) to be infrequent. Other possible modes of inactivation, such as de novo methylation and homozygous deletion, have since been shown to occur in numerous neoplasias. Furthering the complexity of this locus, a transcript overlapping the p16(INK4a) coding sequence and encoding a novel peptide with growth-suppressive activity, p19(ARF), has been described. To clearly elucidate the target of aberrations affecting this subchromosomal region and approximate frequency in breast cancer, we performed a comprehensive study including p16 deletion analysis by means of interphase chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization, methylation analysis of the first exon encoding p16(INK4a) (exon 1alpha), mutational analysis of exon 1beta by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of p19(ARF) transcripts, and expression of both alpha and beta transcripts by reverse transcription PCR. Homozygous deletion of p16, as determined by interphase chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization, was observed in 3 of 18 (17%) tumors analyzed, whereas de novo methylation of exon 1alpha was observed in an additional 17% (4 of 23). Reduced expression of p16(INK4a) was observed in 11 tumors (48%), including all those in which homozygous deletion or complete methylation was observed. No mutations of exon 1 beta were detected, and expression of its transcript was variable, with 13% demonstrating decreased expression and 17% demonstrating overexpression. These results further support p16(INK4a) as a target of inactivation in the 9p21 region for breast cancer.",

These tumors largely arise from the oropharynx, particularly the tonsil and base of tongue. The first manifestation of HPV-associated HNSCC is frequently as metastasis to cervical lymph nodes that can be documented by fine-needle aspiration. These metastases are often cystic with a predominantly non-keratinizing, basaloid morphology. Knowledge of the HPV status of metastatic HNSCC has significant treatment and prognostic implications as HPV-associated tumors have a more favorable prognosis than conventional HNSCC. Accordingly, HPV testing should be performed on any squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary identified in neck lymph nodes. HPV detection may be performed using a variety of methods including p16 as a surrogate immunohistochemical marker, in situ hybridization and/or polymerase chain reaction detection of viral DNA or RNA. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal method for HPV detection in fine-needle aspiration specimens. Cytology screening for HPV-associated HNSCC does not appear to be effective.

P16(INK4A) is often used as a surrogate marker for HPV-infection, although there is still controversy with respect its reliability. Our aim was to determine if p16(INK4A) overexpression can accurately predict both high-risk and low-risk-HPV-presence in (pre)malignant and benign head and neck lesions. P16(INK4A) immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 162 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC), 14 tonsillar and 23 laryngeal dysplasias, and 20 tonsillar and 27 laryngeal papillomas. PCR, enzyme-immunoassay and FISH analysis were used to assess HPV-presence and type. Of the 162 OPSCC and 14 tonsillar dysplasias, 51 (31%) and 10 (71%) were HPV16-positive, respectively. All tonsillar papillomas were HPV-negative and four laryngeal dysplasias and 26 laryngeal papillomas were positive for HPV6 or -11. P16(INK4A) immunohistochemistry revealed a strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in 50 out of 51 HPV16-positive and 5 out of 111 HPV-negative OPSCC (p < 0.0001) and in all HPV16-positive tonsillar dysplasias, whereas highly variable staining patterns were detected in the papillomas and laryngeal dysplasias, irrespective of the HPV-status. In addition, the latter lesions generally showed a higher nuclear than cytoplasmic p16(INK4A) immunostaining intensity. In conclusion, our data show that strong nuclear and cytoplasmic p16(INK4A) overexpression is a reliable surrogate indicator for HPV16 in OPSCC and (adjacent) dysplasias. For HPV6 or -11-positive and HPV-negative benign and premalignant lesions of the tonsil and larynx, however, p16(INK4A) immunostaining is highly variable and cannot be recommended to predict HPV-presence.",

An immunohistochemical study of p14(ARF) expression in 74 samples of aggressive B-cell lymphomas was performed, demonstrating an array of different abnormalities. A distinct nucleolar expression pattern was detected in nontumoral tissue and a subset of lymphomas (50/74). In contrast, a group of cases (8/74) showed absence of p14(ARF) expression, dependent either on promoter hypermethylation or gene loss. Additionally, 16 out of 74 cases displayed an abnormal nuclear p14(ARF) overexpression not confined to the nucleoli, as confirmed by confocal microscopy, and that was associated with high levels of p53 and Hdm2. A genetic study of these cases failed to show any alteration in the p14(ARF) gene, but revealed the presence of p53 mutations in over 50% of these cases. An increased growth fraction and a more aggressive clinical course, with a shortened survival time, also characterized the group of tumors with p14(ARF) nuclear overexpression. Moreover, this p14(ARF) expression pattern was more frequent in tumors displaying accumulated alterations in the p53, p16(INK4a), and p27(KIP1) tumor supressors.

This latter effect has been attributed to damage to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Using a mouse model, we investigated whether IR induces senescence in HSCs, as induction of HSC senescence can lead to the defect in HSC self-renewal. It was found that exposure of C57BL/6 mice to a sublethal dose (6.5 Gy) of total body irradiation (TBI) resulted in a sustained quantitative and qualitative reduction of LKS+ HSCs. In addition, LKS+ HSCs from irradiated mice exhibited an increased expression of the 2 commonly used biomarkers of cellular senescence, p16(Ink4a) and SA-beta-gal. In contrast, no such changes were observed in irradiated LKS- hematopoietic progenitor cells. These results provide the first direct evidence demonstrating that IR exposure can selectively induce HSC senescence. Of interest, the induction of HSC senescence was associated with a prolonged elevation of p21(Cip1/Waf1), p19(Arf), and p16(Ink4a) mRNA expression, while the expression of p27(Kip1) and p18(Ink4c) mRNA was not increased following TBI.

Azidothymidine (AZT) is being tested in several clinical trials as an enhancer of anticancer chemotherapy. However, the knowledge of the relationship between AZT and cellular pathways, e.g. p53 pathway, is very limited. In this study, we show that AZT, cisplatin (CDDP) and docetaxel (DTX) all induce unique molecular responses in OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma cells carrying a mutated p53, while in A2780, ovarian carcinoma and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells with wild type p53, all of these drugs cause similar p53 responses. We found that endogenous p14(ARF) protein in OVCAR-3 cells is down-regulated by DTX but induced by AZT and a short CDDP pulse treatment. In HT-29 colon carcinoma cells with a mutated p53, all treatments down-regulated p14(ARF) protein. Both CDDP and AZT increased the expression of p14ARF mRNA in OVCAR-3 cells.

No increase in the level of either c-Myc or H-ras oncoproteins was seen in OVCAR-3 cells after AZT or CDDP-treatment.

There was no evidence that SDB accelerated a constitutive cell division counting mechanism as previously suggested because cells pretreated with SDB for three mean population doublings (MPDs) exhibited a similar overall proliferative life span to controls once SDB was withdrawn. SDB-treated cells upregulated the cell cycle inhibitors p21(WAF1) and p16(INK4A), but not p14(ARF), in the same sequential order as in senescence and the cells developed biochemical markers of senescence. However, the mechanism of senescence did not involve telomere dysfunction and there was no evidence for any posttranslational modification of p53. The expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6 in human fibroblasts or targeted disruption of the p53 and p21(WAF) genes only weakly antagonized HDACI-induced senescence. However, expression of the E7 gene, which inhibits the function of pRb, cooperated with E6 to block SDB-induced senescence completely and human cells deficient in p16(INK4A) (but not p14(ARF)) were also resistant to SDB-induced senescence, suggesting that the p16(INK4A)/pRb pathway is the major mediator of HDACI-induced senescence in human cells. However, p53-/- mouse fibroblasts were resistant to HDACI-induced senescence, identifying p53 as the major pathway to senescence in this species.",

Inactivation of p16 has previously been associated with the prognostically unfavourable primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCLBCL, LT). In this work, we analysed 22 tumors [nine primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphomas (PCFCL), seven primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas (PCMZL) and six PCLBCL, LT] not only for alterations of the p16 gene but also for p14, p53 and Rb by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. In most PCLBCL, LT (4/6) alterations of CDKN2A (two biallelic deletions, one monoallelic deletion and one trisomy 9) and in addition the highest frequency of deletions of p53 (3/6) and Rb (3/6) were detected. p16 was not expressed but very high levels of phosphorylated Rb, indicating a functional effect of genomic CDKN2A alterations on the protein level in PCLBCL, LT. Regarding the p14/p53 axis, PCLBCL, LT showed a variable expression. Neither PCFCL nor PCMZL showed alterations of CDKN2A and also deletions of p53 or Rb were extremely rare in these subtypes. Exclusively in PCMZL, p53 protein was consistently lacking. In conclusion, only PCLBCL, LT is characterized by a high frequency of aberrations of the CDKN2A network components in both important tumor suppressor pathways regulated by the CDKN2A gene. Moreover, PCLBCL, LT appears to be distinguishable from PCMZL not only by its level of p53 expression but also by its stage of Rb phosphorylation. The latter may also apply to a subgroup of PCFCL.",

None of the p16(INK4) -positive cases were positive for high-risk HPV by ISH.

Diabetes incidence increases with age, and many studies link the classic senescence and ageing protein p16(INK4A) to diabetes pathophysiology via pancreatic islet biology. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have unequivocally linked the CDKN2A/B locus, which encodes p16 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (p16(INK4A)) and three other gene products, p14 alternate reading frame (p14(ARF)), p15(INK4B) and antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), with human diabetes risk. However, the mechanism by which the CDKN2A/B locus influences diabetes risk remains uncertain. Here, we weigh the evidence that CDKN2A/B polymorphisms impact metabolic health via islet biology vs effects in other tissues. Structured in a bedside-to-bench-to-bedside approach, we begin with a summary of the evidence that the CDKN2A/B locus impacts diabetes risk and a brief review of the basic biology of CDKN2A/B gene products. The main emphasis of this work is an in-depth look at the nuanced roles that CDKN2A/B gene products and related proteins play in the regulation of beta cell mass, proliferation and insulin secretory function, as well as roles in other metabolic tissues. We finish with a synthesis of basic biology and clinical observations, incorporating human physiology data. We conclude that it is likely that the CDKN2A/B locus influences diabetes risk through both islet and non-islet mechanisms. ",

Moreover, germline mutations identified in some melanoma-prone kindreds last year suggested that CDKN2 is identical to the 9p21-linked melanoma susceptibility gene (MLM); however, failure to identify p16 mutations in all melanoma kindreds putatively linked to 9p21 left some doubts. We have analysed CDKN2 coding sequences in 15 Dutch familial atypical multiple mole-melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome pedigrees, and identified a 19 basepair (bp) germline deletion in 13 of them. All 13 families originate from an endogamous population. The deletion causes a reading frame shift, predicted to result in a severely truncated p16 protein. Interestingly, two family members are homozygous for the deletion, one of whom shows no obvious signs of disease. This surprising finding demonstrates that homozygotes for this CDKN2 mutation are viable, and suggests the presence of a genetic mechanism that can compensate for the functional loss of p16. Our results also greatly strengthen the notion that p16 is indeed MLM.",

A 19-bp germline deletion in the CDKN2 gene was detected in the high-risk haplotype, suggesting CDKN2 to be identical to MLM.

The gene encodes an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which regulate the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene and the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. In the present study, p16 gene promoter hypermethylation patterns and p16 protein expression were analyzed in 100 consecutive untreated cases of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemical staining. The p16 promoter hypermethylation and apparent loss of p16 protein expression were detected in 27% and 74% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. By chi(2) test, history of alcohol or tobacco use was significantly correlated with the loss of p16 protein expression (P =.005 and.05, respectively). When patient follow-up data were correlated with various clinical and molecular parameters, tumor size and nodal and clinical stage were the strongest prognostic predictors for disease-free survival (tumor recurrence) and for cause-specific and overall survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Sca-1(+)HSC induced aging by tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP, final concentration of 100 μmol/L) for 6 h to establish the murine HSC aging model in vitro. Biological characteristics of aging HSC were evaluated by mixed hematopoietic progenitor cell culture in vitro, cell cycle assay and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) cytochemical staining. Telomere length and telomerase activity were detected by southern blotting and telomere repeat amplification protocol-polymerase chain reaction (TRAP-PCR) augmentation. The expressions of p16(INK4a), P19(Arf), P53, P21(Cip1/Waf1) mRNA were detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The purity of separated Sca-1(+) HSC was 87.2% and the survival of Sca-1(+) HSC was 96~99%. After 6 h cocultured with 100 μmol/L t-BHP, the ability of aging Sca-1(+) HSC to form mixed hematopoietic progenitor colony, self-renewal and multi-differentiation were decreased significantly.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted infection in the world. France and Belgium present one of the highest incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) worldwide. Besides, considering only the male population, HNSCCs represent the fourth most frequent cancer after prostate, lung and colon cancers. Although the causal link between high-risk HPVs and cervical carcinoma is well established, the implication of this viral infection in HNSCC remains debatable. Here, we discuss current knowledge concerning the HPV implication in HNSCCs. Based on our literature review, 20 to 25% of HNSCCs could be associated with oncogenic HPVs, in particular HPV type 16. The oropharynx--more precisely the tonsil--is the head and neck location presenting the highest incidence of HPV infection. Moreover, a clear increase of tonsillar carcinoma incidence has been described. As observed in cervical carcinomas, HPV positive HNSCCs are sexually transmitted and characterized by alterations of p53 and pRb signalling pathways. Several studies have shown that HPV positive subgroup presented better prognosis particularly if these patients overexpressed p16INK4. New studies regarding HPV status in HNSCCs are warranted to provide a rationale for large scale HPV vaccination in young male populations.",

The identification of a disease-associated intronic mutation of CDKN2A in UK families, which has proved to be the most common CDKN2A mutation as yet identified in this population, has highlighted the possibility that additional causal mutations may lie within the intronic sequence of the gene. In this article, we describe the comprehensive screening of 109 English and 26 Australian melanoma pedigrees for intronic mutations of CDKN2A. In total, 24 sequence variants were identified across the two introns of the gene. We show evidence that two of the CDKN2A intronic variants (IVS1 + 1104 C > A and IVS1 - 1104 C > G) predispose to melanoma.

While the involvement of Ink4a in lung tumor development has been widely described, the tumor suppressor gene has not been studied in radon-induced lung tumors. In this study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the Cdkn2a locus, common to the Ink4a and Arf genes, was performed on 33 radon-induced rat lung tumors and showed a DNA loss in 50% of cases. The analysis of p16(Ink4a) protein expression by immunohistochemistry revealed that 50% of the tumors were negative for this protein. Looking for the origin of this lack of expression, we observed a low frequency of homozygous deletion (6%), a lack of mutation, an absence of correlation between promoter methylation and Ink4a mRNA expression and no correlation between LOH and protein expression. However, a tendency for an inverse correlation between p16(Ink4a) and pRb protein expression was observed. The expressions of p19Arf, Mmd2 and Mdm4 were not deregulated and only 14% of the tumors were mutated for Tp53. These results indicated that Ink4a/Cdk4/Rb1 pathway deregulation, more than Arf/Mdm2/Tp53 pathway, has a major role in the development of these tumors through p16(Ink4a) deregulation. However, all known mechanisms of inactivation of the pathway do not play a recurrent role in these tumors and the actual origin of the lack of p16(Ink4a) protein expression remains to be established.",

To clarify this, stemness molecule expressions were determined in HNSCC, as well as their properties and prognosis. Two proto-oncogenic chromatin regulators, Bmi-1 and high-mobility-group A2 (Hmga2), were identified in 12 pair cases of HNSCC tumor regions by comparison with their non-cancerous background tissues using cDNA microarray. Both Bmi-1 and Hmga2 are known to promote stem cell self-renewal by negatively regulating the expressions of Ink4a and Arf tumor suppressors. Despite similar targets, Bmi-1 protein was expressed in an early cancerous region and HMGA2 protein was expressed in a region showing more progression. Similarly, Bmi1 expression had no significance with regard to overall survival (P=0.67), whereas HMGA2 expression was associated with decreased overall survival (P=0.05). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses also correlated with protein levels. These findings suggest that Bmi-1 is an early detection marker to distinguish cancerous from non-cancerous regions, whereas HMGA2 is presumed to be a tumor prognosis marker. Among our HNSCC analyses, these stemness molecules expressed fewer primitive rare cells in the tumor than all other cells in the tumor. HNSCC cells with high expression of stemness molecules partly behave like stem cells.",

Although the tumor suppressor capability of p15(INK4b) is still questioned, it has been found to be specifically inactivated by hypermethylation in hematopoietic malignancies in the absence of p16(INK4a) alterations. Here we show that, in vitro, p15(INK4b) is a strong inhibitor of cellular transformation by Ras. Surprisingly, p15(INK4b) is induced in cultured cells by oncogenic Ras to an extent similar to that of p16(INK4a), and their expression is associated with premature G(1) arrest and senescence. Ras-dependent induction of these two INK4 genes is mediated mainly by the Raf-Mek-Erk pathway. Studies with activated and dominant negative forms of Ras effectors indicate that the Raf-Mek-Erk pathway is essential for induction of both the p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a) promoters, although other Ras effector pathways can collaborate, giving rise to a stronger response. Our results indicate that p15(INK4b), by itself, is able to stop cell transformation by Ras and other oncogenes such as Rgr (a new oncogene member of the Ral-GDS family, whose action is mediated through Ras). In fact, embryonic fibroblasts isolated from p15(INK4b) knockout mice are susceptible to transformation by the Ras or Rgr oncogene whereas wild-type embryonic fibroblasts are not. Similarly, p15(INK4b)-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts are more sensitive than wild-type cells to transformation by a combination of the Rgr and E1A oncogenes. The cell cycle inhibitor p15(INK4b) is therefore involved, at least in some cell types, in the tumor suppressor activity triggered after inappropriate oncogenic Ras activation in the cell.",

By disrupting cyclin D-dependent holoenzymes, INK4 proteins prevent phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and block entry into the DNA-synthetic phase of the cell division cycle. The founding family member, p16(INK4a), is a potent tumor suppressor in humans, whereas involvement, if any, of other INK4 proteins in tumor surveillance is less well documented. INK4c and INK4d are expressed during mouse embryogenesis in stereotypic tissue-specific patterns and are also detected, together with INK4b, in tissues of young mice. INK4a is expressed neither before birth nor at readily appreciable levels in young animals, but its increased expression later in life suggests that it plays some checkpoint function in response to cell stress, genotoxic damage, or aging per se. We used targeted gene disruption to generate mice lacking INK4d. These animals developed into adulthood, had a normal life span, and did not spontaneously develop tumors. Tumors did not arise at increased frequency in animals neonatally exposed to ionizing radiation or the carcinogen dimethylbenzanthrene. Mouse embryo fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and lymphoid T and B cells isolated from these animals proliferated normally and displayed typical lineage-specific differentiation markers. Males exhibited marked testicular atrophy associated with increased apoptosis of germ cells, although they remained fertile.

No somatic mutations of p16INK4(MTS1) were observed in the 26 cases of HCC. The most common somatic alteration of the p16INK4(MTS1) gene in HCC was de novo methylation, which was detected in 48% of the cases. Low levels (21%) of p16INK4(MTS1) gene allele loss were observed. Altogether, these results indicate that alteration of the p16INK4(MTS1) gene plays an important role in the genesis of HCC.",

In addition, human papillomavirus infection determined by PCR assay and the use of alcohol and cigarettes were evaluated. In this study 28 non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia and 57 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were considered. The expression levels of fragile histidine triad were lower in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma than in non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia. In contrast, p16INK4a is expressed in malignant lesions (51% of the cases analyzed), but not in non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia. No correlation between gene expression alterations of the two tumor suppressors was observed. PCR analysis showed that HPV DNA was present in 5 of the 57 malignant lesions analyzed (8.8%). None of the factors described above, despite changes in gene expression and HPV infection, appears to be associated with alcohol use and/or tobacco smoking and clinical outcome. Our data showed that fragile histidine triad and p16INK4a expression are altered in malignant lesions. Most likely, the decreasing levels of fragile histidine triad is directly involved in cancer development, while the accumulation of p16INK4a in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma may be the consequence of loss of functional tumor suppressor retinoblastoma pathway.",

Accordingly, we examined the DNA methylation status of ten tumor-related genes (RB1, p16(INK4a), p73, MGMT, ER, DAPK, TIMP-3, p14(ARF), THBS1, and Caspase-8) in 98 meningiomas (68 grade I; 27 grade II; and 3 grade III samples) using methylation-specific PCR and sequencing. The most frequently methylated genes were THBS1 (30%), TIMP-3 (24%), p16(INK4a) (17%), MGMT (16%), p73 (15%), ER (15%), and p14(ARF) (13%), whereas methylation was relatively rare in the other genes (<10%). Methylation occurred in at least one gene in 77.5% of the cases and in three or more genes in 25.5%. Methylation was tumor specific since it was absent in the controls: two non-neoplastic meningeal samples and two non-neoplastic brain samples. The frequency of aberrant gene methylation in grade I versus grade II-III tumors showed some differences for TIMP-3, THBS1, MGMT, p16(INK4a) and p73; these differences reached statistical significance for TIMP-3: 18% in grade I versus 40% in grade II-III (P < 0.02). Our previous loss of heterozygosity studies provided the allelic constitution at 1p and 22q for 60 of the 98 meningiomas included in this report. The level of aberrant promoter methylation increased in tumors (30 samples) displaying 1p loss (either isolated or as concurrent deletion at 1p/22q; P = 0.014).

Studies in animal models have shown that inactivation of the products of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene locus, p16INK4A and p14ARF, promotes the development of pheochromocytoma, especially in malignant form. The present study evaluated the involvement of CDKN2A in human pheochromocytomas and abdominal extra-adrenal paragangliomas from 55 patients. Promoter methylation was assessed using quantitative Pyrosequencing and methylation-specific PCR, and mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. For p16, western blot analysis and sequencing were also performed. succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B (SDHB) sequencing analysis included extra-adrenal paragangliomas, all tumors classified as malignant, and cases diagnosed at 30 years or younger. The p16INK4A promoter was heavily methylated in a subset of paragangliomas, and this was significantly associated with malignancy (P<0.0043) and SDHB mutation (P<0.002). p16INK4A mRNA expression showed moderate suppression in malignant cases (P<0.05). In contrast, very little p14ARF promoter methylation was seen and there was no significant difference in p14ARF expression between tumors and normal samples. The p16 protein expression was reduced in 16 tumors, and sequence variations were observed in four tumors including the missense mutation A57V and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A148T. The results suggest that p16INK4A, and not p14ARF, is a subject of frequent involvement in these tumors. Importantly, hypermethylation of the p16INK4A promoter was significantly associated with malignancy and metastasis, and SDHB gene mutations.

Here we report a novel deletion/substitution from CC to T in the shared exon 2 of p14ARF/p16 in a melanoma cell line. This mutation aligns the reading frames of p14ARF and p16 mid-transcript, producing one protein which is half p14ARF and half p16, chimera ARF (chARF), and another which is half p16 and half non-p14ARF/non-p16 amino acids, p16-Alternate Carboxyl Terminal (p16-ACT). In an effort to understand the cellular impact of this novel mutation and others like it, we expressed the two protein products in a tumor cell line and analyzed common p14ARF and p16 pathways, including the p53/p21 and CDK4/cyclin D1 pathways, as well as the influence of the two proteins on growth and the cell cycle. We report that chARF mimicked wild-type p14ARF by inducing the p53/p21 pathway, inhibiting cell growth through G2/M arrest and maintaining a certain percentage of cells in G1 during nocodazole-induced G2 arrest. chARF also demonstrated p16 activity by binding CDK4. However, rather than preventing cyclin D1 from binding CDK4, chARF stabilized this interaction through p21 which bound CDK4. p16-ACT had no p16-related function as it was unable to inhibit cyclin D1/CDK4 complex formation and was unable to arrest the cell cycle, though it did inhibit colony formation. We conclude that these novel chimeric proteins, which are very similar to predicted p16/p14ARF chimeric proteins found in other primary cancers, result in maintained p14ARF-p53-p21 signaling while p16-dependent CDK4 inhibition is lost.

In addition, loss of heterozygosity at chromosome segment 9p21, with the use of the microsatellite marker D9S171, was studied in these samples. Whereas CDKN2 was either deleted or mutated in NSCLC cell lines at a high frequency (6/9, 67%), alterations were much less frequent (7/34, 21%) in primary tumor samples. Only one sample contained a point mutation in exon 1 of CDKN2. In addition, two samples had homozygous deletions of CDKN2 in exon 1; one had a homozygous and three a hemizygous deletion of exon 2. Possibly normal tissue contaminating our tumor samples may have masked homozygous deletions in these cases.

Loss of heterozygosity analysis using a dense set of 9p markers showed allelic imbalance that included CDKN2A in only 31% of samples, but a further 47% showed loss at loci near CDKN2A with apparent retention of CDKN2A. No tumor with any allelic imbalance expressed CDKN2A, whether or not the imbalance appeared to involve the CDKN2A locus. We interpret these data as showing partially overlapping deletions on the two 9p homologues, with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A masked by amplification of contaminating stromal material. Our data show that inactivation of the CDKN2A gene products is a near-universal step in the development of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and we suggest that homozygous deletion is the most common mechanism of inactivation. The CDKN2A locus may be particularly prone to deletion because it encodes two unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, CDKN2A (p16INK4a) and p19ARF, and deletion, but not point mutation or methylation, would inactivate both gene products.

Furthermore, JunB-mediated p16 induction in 3T3 cells completely abolished cyclin D-associated kinase activity, resulting in reduced pRb hyperphosphorylation and G(1)-phase extension. Moreover, three AP1-like binding sites were identified in the p16 promoter through which JunB directly activates p16 transcription. Elevated JunB expression in 3T3 cells also inhibited Ras- and Src-mediated transformation and tumour growth in vivo. The suppressive effect of JunB on cell proliferation was shown to be dependent on p16 since it did not occur in INK4a(-/-) fibroblasts that lack both p16 and p19(ARF). These results demonstrate that p16 is a direct transcriptional target gene of JunB and identify JunB as a negative regulator of cell proliferation.",

In addition, the p16INK4a promoter is hypermethylated in most BL biopsies and BL cell lines, leading to silencing of this gene. Activation of c-myc and/or cell cycle dysregulation can induce ARF expression and p53-dependent apoptosis. We therefore investigated the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway in BL cell lines. p14ARF was expressed and localized to nucleoli in all BL carrying mutant p53. Three out of seven BL carrying wt p53 had a homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus that encodes both p14ARF and p16INK4a. Three BL carrying wild type p53 retained the CDKN2A locus and overexpressed MDM2. DNA sequencing revealed a point mutation in CDKN2A exon 2 in one of these BL, Seraphine. However, this point mutation did not affect p14ARF's nucleolar localization or ability to induce p53. The Bmi-1 protein that negatively regulates the p14ARF promoter and co-operates with c-myc in tumorigenesis was expressed at low to moderate levels in all BL analysed. Our results indicate that inactivation of the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway is an essential step during the development of Burkitt lymphoma, presumably as a mechanism to escape c-myc induced apoptosis.",

When treated with five different chemotherapy drugs with different mechanism after the transfection, A549 got an increased chemosensitivity for adriamycin and cisplatin and an unchanged result for topotecan, taxol or vinorelbine. The results indicated that cell cycle redistribution and increased apoptosis index after transfection might be the main explanation for the enhanced chemosensitivity.

Although p16(INK4a) immunohistology is routinely used as a cost effective surrogate marker, many of the published articles are confusing and contradictory. The discrepancies can be ascribed to a multitude of factors operating at the molecular, technical and interpretative levels. In the first place, our simplistic model of viral mediated oncogenesis is speculative and fails to account for all the known biomolecular changes. Unresolved technical issues include the variables of tissue fixation, antibody dilution, antibody isotype and clone, and the sensitivity of the particular detection method. Within any controlled staining method, strong diffuse or 'block' immunoreactivity in squamous cells may be found in moderate/severe dysplasia (CIN 2/3) and invasive squamous carcinoma. In contrast, focal or multifocal reactivity in squamous cells may be artefactual, related to low risk or HR-HPV. p16(INK4a) is less reliable when dealing with glandular lesions since considerable overlap exists between reactive and dysplastic lesions. In addition not all glandular dysplasias/carcinomas are HR-HPV related, nor are all p16(INK4a) immunoreactive lesions associated with HR-HPV. We conclude that p16(INK4a) immunoperoxidase shows greater specificity than sensitivity for squamous lesions; in comparison, glandular dysplasias/carcinomas show reduced specificity and sensitivity. Like all cell cycle regulatory proteins, the future diagnostic role of p16(INK4a) is limited. The ideal diagnostic molecular test for cervical dysplasias will detect a HR-HPV related product after, but not before, cell transformation and will reliably predict those cases yet to experience disease progression.",

One hundred thirty-seven squamous cell carcinomas from 5 primary sites, including 34 from the oropharynx (tonsil and base of tongue), 43 cases from nonoropharyngeal head and neck sites, and 20 cases each from the lung, esophagus, and skin, were retrieved from our surgical pathology archives. Immunohistochemistry for p16 was performed on each case. All p16-positive cases and 21 p16-negative cases were further tested for both high-risk and low-risk human papillomavirus by in situ hybridization. p16 expression was detected in 54 cases overall, including 25 (74%) of 34 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, 8 (19%) of 43 nonoropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinomas including 3 of 4 from the sinonasal cavity, 6 (30%) of 20 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 7 (35%) of 20 lung squamous cell carcinomas, and 8 (40%) of 20 skin squamous cell carcinomas.

However, no meta-analysis regarding the survival according to combined HPV/p16 status has been performed yet. The objective of this study was to discriminate the impact of combined HPV(+/-) and p16(+/-) status on survival. Data sources were identification and review of publications assessing survival of the distinct subgroups with both p16 and HPV investigated in HNSCC until February, 2015. A meta-analysis was performed to classify survival and clinical outcomes. 18 out of 397 articles (4424 patients) were eligible for the meta-analysis. The percent proportion of the subgroups was 25 % for HPV(+)/p16(+), 61.2 % for HPV(-)/p16(-), 7.1 % for HPV(-)/p16(+) and 6.8 % for HPV(+)/P16(-). The meta-analysis showed a significantly improved 5-year overall survival (OS), 5-year disease-free survival and their corresponding hazard ratio for HPV(+)/p16(+) HNSCC in comparison to HPV(-)/p16(-), HPV(+)/p16(-) and HPV(-)/p16(+). The 5-year OS of the HPV(-)/p16(+) subgroup was intermediate while HPV(+)/p16(-) and HPV(-)/p16(-) HNSCC had the shortest survival. With current therapeutic strategies, survival of patients with HNSCC is better if associated with HPV(+)/p16(+) or HPV(-)/p16(+). Clinical trials are needed to confirm the distinct survival pattern and to investigate possible differences in survival for HPV(+)/p16(-) and HPV(-)/p16(+) HNSCC.

Because the function of the products of these naturally occurring mutants has not been fully explored, we investigated the functional activities of a wide range of naturally occurring p16 mutant proteins.;Sixteen cancer-associated p16 mutant proteins, resulting from missense mutations, were characterized for their ability to bind and inhibit the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6) and to induce cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase.;Among 16 mutants analyzed, nine had detectable functional defects. Three mutants (D84V, D84G, and R87P) had defects in CDK binding, kinase inhibition, and cell cycle arrest. The corresponding mutations are located in the third ankyrin repeat in a highly conserved region believed to form the CDK binding cleft. Three mutants (P48L, D74N, and R87L) had defects in kinase inhibition and cell cycle arrest. Among the 10 mutants with normal CDK binding and inhibitory activity, three mutants (N71S, R80L, and H83Y) had defects only in their ability to induce cell cycle arrest. Thus, p16 mutant proteins that retain CDK4 and CDK6 binding may have more subtle functional defects. All nine mutations leading to functional impairments mapped to the central portion of the p16 protein. Ankyrin repeats II and III appear more critical to p16 function, and mutations in ankyrin repeats I and IV are less likely to disrupt p16 function.",

A few case reports of oral squamous cell carcinomas arising from regions of phenytoin induced gingival overgrowth (GO), and overexpression of mitogenic factors and p53 have presented this condition as a pathology with potential to transform into malignancy. We recently investigated the genetic status of p53 and H-ras, which are known to be frequently mutated in Indian oral carcinomas in GO tissues and found them to only contain wild type sequences, which suggested a non-neoplastic nature of phenytoin induced GO. However, besides p53 and H-ras, other oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as PIK3CA, p14ARF, p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1, are frequently altered in oral squamous cell carcinoma, and hence are required to be analyzed in phenytoin induced GO tissues to be affirmative of its non-neoplastic nature.;100ng of chromosomal DNA isolated from twenty gingival overgrowth tissues were amplified with primers for exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA, exons 1α, 1β and 2 of p16INK4a and p14ARF, and exon 2 of p21Waf1/Cip1, in independent reactions.

However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative effects of p16(INK4a) have not been fully elucidated. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF)1A2 as a novel interacting partner of p16(INK4a). eEF1A2 is thought to function as an oncogene in cancers. The p16(INK4a) protein interacted with all but the D2 (250-327 aa) domain of eEF1A2. Ectopic expression of p16(INK4a) decreased the expression of eEF1A2 and inhibited cancer cell growth. Furthermore, suppression of protein synthesis by expression of p16(INK4a) ex vivo was verified by luciferase reporter activity. Microinjection of p16(INK4a) mRNA into the cytoplasm of Xenopus embryos suppressed the luciferase mRNA translation, whereas the combination of p16(INK4a) and morpholino-eEF1A2 resulted in a further reduction in translational activity. We conclude that the interaction of p16(INK4a) with eEF1A2, and subsequent downregulation of the expression and function of eEF1A2 is a novel mechanism explaining the anti-proliferative effects of p16(INK4a).",

From a cohort of 153 OTSCC patients, 131 formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks of pre-treatment primary tumours were suitable for further molecular analysis. We assessed CDKN2A (p16) levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC), promoter methylation status by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, mutation status by Sanger sequencing, gene copy number variation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and correlated these with patient outcome. We found that the majority of OTSCC did not overexpress p16 (110/116, 95%), assessed by IHC. The frequency of CDKN2A mutations was 20% (21/103), homozygous loss was 7% (7/97), hemizygous loss 31% (30/97), and promoter methylation was 18% (20/113).

Translational repression of VEGFA mRNA by p19(ARF) does not require p53, a major target of the ARF tumor suppressor pathway, but instead correlates with binding to nucleophosmin/B23. Maintaining VEGFA expression relies on nucleophosmin/B23, and downregulating this protein by RNAi or p19(ARF) leads to translational repression of VEGFA. p19(ARF) inhibits VEGFA-dependent tumor angiogenesis in nude mice.

Differences between normal epithelium and cancer cells from the upper aerodigestive tract arise from alterations in expression of specific genes controlling proliferation and immortalization. The protein products of these genes include growth factor receptors, cell cycle regulators, and tumor suppressors which affect a variety of intracellular signaling pathways. To determine how altered expression of these gene products contribute to HNSCC progression, we examined expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cyclins, p16INK4A, c-myc, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and telomerase in archival pathology specimens by immunohistochemistry. A substantial majority of HNSCC tumors showed loss of p16INK4A expression and dramatic overexpression of EGFR. Overexpression of this receptor correlated with increased cyclin A levels and high mitotic index. EGFR, cyclins A, -B1, -E, and c-myc overexpression was significantly increased in stage III and IV tumors compared to early stage cancers. hTERT was expressed in all tumors and primarily in the basal layer cells of dysplastic epithelial lesions. Suprabasal expression of hTERT was found in a significantly higher number of HNSCC cases than in dysplastic lesions.

This irreversible 'fail-safe mechanism' requires p19(ARF), p53 and the Retinoblastoma (Rb) family: upon their disruption, RAS(V12)-expressing cells fail to undergo senescence and continue to proliferate. Similarly, co-expression of oncogenes such as c-MYC or E1A rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence. To identify novel genes that allow escape from RAS(V12)-induced senescence, we designed an unbiased, retroviral complementary DNA library screen. We report on the identification of DRIL1, the human orthologue of the mouse Bright and Drosophila dead ringer transcriptional regulators. DRIL1 renders primary murine fibroblasts unresponsive to RAS(V12)-induced anti-proliferative signalling by p19(ARF)/p53/p21(CIP1), as well as by p16(INK4a). In this way, DRIL1 not only rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence but also causes these fibroblasts to become highly oncogenic. Furthermore, DRIL1 immortalizes mouse fibroblasts, in the presence of high levels of p16(INK4a). Immortalization by DRIL1, whose product binds the pRB-controlled transcription factor E2F1 (ref. 8), is correlated with induction of E2F1 activity. Correspondingly, DRIL1 induces the E2F1 target Cyclin E1, overexpression of which is sufficient to trigger escape from senescence. Thus, DRIL1 disrupts cellular protection against RAS(V12)-induced proliferation downstream of the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The two gene products of the CDKN2A gene, p16 and p19ARF, have recently been linked to each of two major tumour suppressor pathways in human carcinogenesis, the RB1 pathway and the p53 pathway. p16 inhibits the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product by cyclin D-dependent kinases, whereas p19ARF targets MDM2, a p53 inhibitory protein, for degradation. A deletion of CDKN2A would therefore disturb both pathways. To explore the p53 pathway genes as a functional unit in diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (DLCL), we wanted to see whether there exists mutually exclusiveness of aberrations of CDKN2A, MDM2 and p53, since this has not been analysed previously. We investigated 37 DLCL for aberrations of p15, p16, p19ARF, MDM2, and p53 at the epigenetic, genetic and/or protein levels. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was detected in seven (19%) of 37 tumours, and another three cases were hypermethylated at the 5' CpG island of p16. No point mutations were found in CDKN2B or CDKN2A. Immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue for p16 confirmed these results, as all tumours with alterations of CDKN2A were p16 immunonegative. We found p53 mutations in eight (22%) cases and MDM2 overexpression in 16 (43%) tumours. Twenty-three (62%) tumours had alterations of one or more p53 pathway components (p53, p19ARF and MDM2). Furthermore, 7/9 (78%) p16-immunonegative tumours showed co-aberration of p53 and/or MDM2. The lack of correlation between these aberrations suggests that DLCL acquire additional growth advantage by inactivating both of these critical regulatory pathways.",

In this study we examined cell-cycle proteins expression and correlation with human papillomavirus infection in a series of 15 pure penile verrucous carcinomas from a single centre. Of 148 penile tumours, 15 (10%) were diagnosed as pure verrucous carcinomas. The expression of the cell-cycle-associated proteins p53, p21, RB, p16(INK4A) and Ki67 were examined by immunohistochemistry. Human papillomavirus infection was determined by polymerase chain reaction to identify a wide range of virus types. The expression of p16(INK4A) and Ki67 was significantly lower in verrucous carcinoma than in usual type squamous cell carcinoma, whereas the expression of p53, p21 and RB was not significantly different. p53 showed basal expression in contrast to usual type squamous cell carcinoma. Human papillomavirus infection was present in only 3 out of 13 verrucous carcinomas. Unique low-risk, high-risk and mixed viral infections were observed in each of the three cases. In conclusion, lower levels of p16(INK4A) and Ki67 expressions differentiate penile verrucous carcinoma from usual type squamous cell carcinoma. The low Ki67 index reflects the slow-growing nature of verrucous tumours. The low level of p16(INK4A) expression and human papillomavirus detection suggests that penile verrucous carcinoma pathogenesis is unrelated to human papillomavirus infection and the oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes classically altered by virus infection.",

Since CDKIs can inhibit cell proliferation, they may have a role as tumor suppressor genes. To determine if alterations of CDKI genes may be involved in tumorigenesis of breast cancer, we examined the mutational status of p16(INK4A), p15(INK4B), p18(INK4C), p19(INK4D) CDKI genes in 36 primary breast carcinomas and 9 breast cancer cell lines using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), direct DNA sequencing, and Southern blot analysis. Furthermore, amplification of cyclin D1, D2, D3 genes were also examined in these samples. One mutation of p15(INK4B) gene occurred, resulting in change of aspartic acid to asparagine at codon 85. Since aspartic acid at this position is conserved between all four human and murine INK4 proteins, this missense mutation may have functional significance. The sample with a p15(INK4B) point mutation was accompanied by amplification of the cyclin D1 gene. A deletion of the p18(INK4C) gene was found in a primary tumor. Three deletions of the p16(INK4A) gene and two deletions of the p15(INK4B) gene were found in the cell lines. Also, we found amplification of the p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) loci in a clinical sample as well as amplification of the p19(INK4D) in another sample, and amplification of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene in one cell line and two primary tumors. We suspect that a critical gene for breast cancer is amplified near the MPO gene. These data indicate that CDKI mutations are moderately rare in breast cancer and are often associated with the simultaneous alteration of more than one cell-cycle regulatory gene.",

The carcinomas were analyzed for allelic loss (LOH) in p16(INK4A) and p53, as well as for mutations in the p16(INK4A) and the p53 gene. In addition, we examined the promoter status of p16(INK4A) by methylation-specific PCR. The presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) 6/11, HPV 16 and HPV 18 DNA was analyzed by PCR. Data were compared to clinical data. Concerning p16, 26 (50%) tumors showed positive immunohistochemistry, 32 (62%) tumors showed allelic loss and 22 tumors (42%) showed promoter hypermethylation. All tumors with negative p16 immunohistochemistry showed LOH near the p16(INK4A) locus and/or hypermethylation of the p16(INK4A) promoter.

All eight of the HNSCC cell lines did not express the p16 protein, and in two of these cell lines (Amc-HN-6 and 8), this was due to a deletion of the p16 gene. Three of the cell lines (Amc-HN-3 to 5) that expressed the p16 mRNA had the same nonsense mutation at codon 50 (CGA-Arg to TGA-Ter). The Amc-HN-1 and Amc-HN-7 cell lines, which did not express the p16 mRNA, had a missense mutation at codon 9 (GCC-Ala to GTC-Val) and a silent mutation at codon 106 (CCC-Pro to CCA), respectively. The Amc-HN-2 cell line (p16 exon-positive/mRNA-negative) had a single base deletion at codon 38 (CGG-Arg to CG), which resulted in a frameshift and a consequent stop signal at codon 44.

Some of these tumors may originate as human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), with better clinical outcome than head neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) in general, and could potentially do well with less treatment. Here, we therefore investigated whether HPV status and p53-expression correlated to clinical outcome in patients with CUP in the head neck region. Fifty metastases were analyzed for presence of HPV DNA, and expression of p16(INK4A) and p53 and the data were correlated to clinical outcome. Patients with HPV DNA-positive (HPVDNA+) metastases had significantly better 5-year overall survival (OS) compared to those with HPVDNA- metastases (80.0% vs. 36.7%, respectively; P = 0.004), with a similar tendency for disease-free survival (DFS). These survival rates showed excellent concordance with those of HPVDNA+ and HPVDNA- OSCC in Sweden during the same time period, strengthening the hypothesis that HPVDNA+ head and neck CUP may originate from HPVDNA+ OSCC. In addition, having absent/intermediary-low as compared to high expression of p53 correlated to a better prognosis with a 69% as compared to 14% 5-year OS, respectively (P < 0.001), and for DFS the tendency was analogous.

We report that p14ARF is epigenetically inactivated in several colorectal cell lines, and its expression is restored by treatment with demethylating agents. In primary colorectal carcinomas, p14ARF promoter hypermethylation was found in 31 of 110 (28%) of the tumors and observed in 13 of 41 (32%) colorectal adenomas but was not present in any normal tissues. p14ARF methylation appears in the context of an adjacent unmethylated p16INK4a promoter in 16 of 31 (52%) of the carcinomas methylated at p14ARF. Although p14ARF hypermethylation was slightly overrepresented in tumors with wild-type p53 compared to tumors harboring p53 mutations [19 of 55 (34%) versus 12 of 55 (22%)], this difference did not reach statistical significance. p14ARF aberrant methylation was not related to the presence of K-ras mutations.

The reduced survival rate of basaloid carcinoma (stage I-II) compared with other histological types of NSCLC was confirmed (p = 0.008). Loss of protein expression of Rb and p16(INK4A) was observed in 12 per cent and 58 per cent of NSCLC cases respectively and cyclin D1 overexpression in 43 per cent. There was an inverse correlation between Rb and p16 expression ( p < 0.0001) and a direct correlation between Rb and cyclin D1 expression ( p = 0.0007). In univariate analysis, Rb-negative adenocarcinomas at stages I-II had a significantly shorter survival than Rb-positive cases ( p = 0.04) and stages I-II p16-positive cases had a shorter survival than p16-negative cases ( p = 0.02), which was more significant in basaloid carcinoma ( p = 0.003). p16 status retained its influence on survival in multivariate analysis at stage I-II for all cases ( p = 0.01) and for basaloid carcinoma ( p = 0.005). Cyclin D1 overexpression did not influence survival. Combined Rb/p16/cyclin D1 phenotypes in univariate analysis showed a shorter survival for Rb-negative/p16-positive/cyclin D1-negative tumours ( p = 0.002). These results, linked to previous data, indicate that the Rb pathway of G1 arrest is initially disrupted in the vast majority of NSCLCs (83 per cent), but could not confirm an unfavourable role for each individual event (p16(INK4A) loss or cyclin D1 up-regulation) in prognosis.",

However, 17-AAG is difficult to formulate and displays weak activity against some tumors. A novel dimeric ansamycin, EC5, was evaluated for antitumor activity in eight head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. Both 17-AAG and EC5 inhibited tumor cell proliferation effectively, but EC5 was more potent, with IC(50) below 200 nmol/L in most cell lines tested, including several lines that were resistant to 17-AAG. The inability of 17-AAG to kill JHU12 cells was linked to a defect in retinoblastoma signaling and could be rescued by ectopic expression of p16(INK4a). EC5 induced G(1) growth arrest of tumor cells and apoptosis, with the degradation of client proteins including epidermal growth factor receptor, c-Raf-1, Akt, and Cdk4 and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. In vivo, EC5 dramatically reduced the growth rate of established HNSCC xenografts in nude mice and decreased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and Akt within the xenografts.

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible implications of molecular alterations of G1 to S-phase check-point genes, especially in the RC component. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of p53, MDM2, p14 and p16 protein and assessed proliferative activities using MIB-1 in 29 RC components and 81 MX components from 90 cases. Mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of the MDM2 gene, homozygous deletion, methylation status and mutation of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) genes were also investigated, using concordant paraffin-embedded and frozen material. The data were analysed together with clinicopathological factors to assess their prognostic implications in MLS/RCLS. Immunohistochemically, the over-expression of p53 protein (p = 0.01366) and the reduced expression of p14 (p < 0.0001) and p16 (p < 0.0001) proteins were significantly more frequently observed in RC components than in MX components. Reduced expression of p14 protein correlated significantly with hypermethylation of the p14(ARF) gene promoter (p = 0.0176) and over-expression of p53 protein (p = 0.00837). By univariate analysis, reduced expression of p14 and p53 missense mutation were found to reduce the rate of survival significantly (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis, including clinicopathological factors, revealed that tumour site (p = 0.0251), the presence of an RC component (p = 0.0113), high MIB-1 labelling index (p = 0.0005) and p53 missense mutation (p = 0.0036) were adverse prognostic factors.

This study aimed to profile aberrant DNA methylation in different stages of liver disease, namely noncirrhosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and also to clarify the influence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the aberrant DNA methylation in HCCs. Promoter methylation in p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) and E-cadherin (E-Cad) genes of 58 HCCs paired with adjacent nontumorous tissues was assayed by methylation-specific PCR. HBV infection was determined using a hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) serological assay. The frequency of p16(INK4a) promoter methylation increased from noncirrhotic, cirrhotic, to HCC tissues (noncirrhotic vs. HCC, p < 0.001), while that of GSTP1 promoter methylation increased in cirrhotic tissues compared to noncirrhotic ones (p = 0.029). The frequency of GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation is significantly higher in HCC than in nontumorous tissues (p = 0.022) from HBsAg-positive patients, but not the HBsAg-negative controls (p = 0.289). While the frequency of E-Cad promoter hypermethylation remained high in both nontumorous tissues and HCCs from HBsAg-positive patients (p = 0.438), it was lower in HCCs than in nontumorous tissues from HBsAg-negative patients (p = 0.002). In contrast, the frequency of p16(INK4a), MGMT and p14(ARF) promoter hypermethylation in HCCs was unrelated to HBsAg status. In conclusion, aberrant DNA methylation may begin at different stages of liver disease in a gene-dependent manner. Moreover, HBV infection may enhance or maintain GSTP1 and E-Cad promoter methylation and thereby affect hepatocarcinogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a long-lived and tumor-resistant rodent. Tumor resistance in the naked mole rat is mediated by the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan of very high molecular weight (HMW-HA). HMW-HA triggers hypersensitivity of naked mole rat cells to contact inhibition, which is associated with induction of the INK4 (inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinase 4) locus leading to cell-cycle arrest. The INK4a/b locus is among the most frequently mutated in human cancer. This locus encodes three distinct tumor suppressors: p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and ARF (alternate reading frame). Although p15(INK4b) has its own ORF, p16(INK4a) and ARF share common second and third exons with alternative reading frames. Here, we show that, in the naked mole rat, the INK4a/b locus encodes an additional product that consists of p15(INK4b) exon 1 joined to p16(INK4a) exons 2 and 3. We have named this isoform pALT(INK4a/b) (for alternative splicing). We show that pALT(INK4a/b) is present in both cultured cells and naked mole rat tissues but is absent in human and mouse cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that pALT(INK4a/b) expression is induced during early contact inhibition and upon a variety of stresses such as UV, gamma irradiation-induced senescence, loss of substrate attachment, and expression of oncogenes. When overexpressed in naked mole rat or human cells, pALT(INK4a/b) has stronger ability to induce cell-cycle arrest than either p15(INK4b) or p16(INK4a). We hypothesize that the presence of the fourth product, pALT(INK4a/b) of the INK4a/b locus in the naked mole rat, contributes to the increased resistance to tumorigenesis of this species. ",

HR-HPV types encode two potent oncogenes, referred to as E6 and E7. Both are required to induce and maintain neoplastic growth of cervical cancer cells. Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor genes as for example p16INK4A were shown to be negative regulated by active pRb. Inactivation of pRb by E7 thus releases the p16 gene from its negative transcriptional control and results in significant overexpression of p16 encoded protein in HPV transformed cells. It has been demonstrated that p16 protein can be detected in cervical preneoplasia all high grade SIL or invasive cancers, whereas no expression was detected in normal, metaplastic or inflammatory cervical lesions. Moreover, low grade cervical lesions induced by low risk HPV infection but histological indistinguishable from low grade lesions induced by HR-HPV-infections could be clearly differentiated by p16INK4A immunohistochemistry, showing negative staining for p16 protein. The objective of this study is to examine the expression of p16 protein in cervical carcinoma in Thailand. Immunohistochemical analysis of p16INK4A was performed on 53 formalin fixed and paraffin embedded samples of various stages of cervical neoplastic lesions. There are squamous cell carcinoma in situ 8 cases, squamous cell carcinoma in situ with glandular involvement 16 cases, microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma 13 cases and invasive squamous cell carcinoma 16 cases. The specimens were taken from cervical biopsy, cervical conization and hysterectomy in the year 2000 at National Cancer Institute. Strong immunoreactivity for the p16 protein was observed in only the nuclei and cytoplasm of all cervical neoplastic cells. This study supported the idea that immunohistochemical overexpression of the p16 protein may be a useful screening test for cervical cancer.

We have investigated the deletion and methylation status of MTS1 and MTS2 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of both T-cell (17 cases) and B-cell phenotypes (29 cases), and p16INK4A and p15INK4B mRNA expression in 36 of these cases. Biallelic or monoallelic loss of both MTS1 and MTS2 was observed in 12 cases of B-ALL and nine cases of T-ALL. Two cases of T-ALL showed deletion of MTS1 but not MTS2. The 5' CpG region of MTS2 was hypermethylated in 12 cases of precursor B-ALL and eight cases of T-ALL but no hypermethylation was found in the 5' CpG region of MTS1. All cases with homozygous deletion of MTS1 or MTS2 had no or low levels of mRNA expression and similar low levels of expression were found in cases in which MTS2 was present but fully methylated. Thus hypermethylation of MTS2, in contrast to MTS1, is frequent in childhood ALL. Furthermore our data show that although inactivation of MTS1 by deletion is common, inactivation of MTS2 by a combination of deletion and hypermethylation is more frequent in both B-ALL (20/29, 69%) and T-ALL (17/17, 100%). This suggests that both MTS1 and MTS2 are important targets of the 9p21-22 deletion.",

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a risk factor for some HNSCC, and its presence is of prognostic value for certain subsites.

Here we examine HPV DNA and p16(INK4a) (p16) overexpression in relation to clinical outcome.;Hypopharyngeal tumour biopsies from 82 patients diagnosed 2008-2013 were examined for presence of HPV DNA by a bead-based multiplex assay and for p16 expression by immunohistochemistry, and the obtained data compared to that acquired previously from 109 patients diagnosed 2000-2007 at the same clinic. A survival analysis was then performed on 142 patients (from both studies) treated with curative intent and a 3-year follow-up time.;Of the tumour biopsies 3/82 (3.7%) were HPV16 DNA and p16 positive, while 12/82 (14.6%) were p16 positive, equivalent to that in the previous study. Overall 3-year survival was significantly more favourable for patients with HPV16 DNA and p16 positive tumours as compared to survival of the other patients (86% vs. 31%, p=0.0185). A similar but not statistically significant trend was found for disease specific survival.;HPV DNA and p16 positive hypopharyngeal cancer was rare and had not increased, but had a better clinical outcome as compared to other HPV-unrelated hypopharyngeal cancer. In addition, p16 overexpression was not a suitable surrogate marker for presence of HPV or for prediction of survival in this type of cancer.",

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of small cell carcinomas and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas underwent immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to thyroid transcription factor-1, p63, high molecular weight keratin, and p16(INK4A). Of 28 small cell carcinomas, 26 (93%) small cell carcinomas showed diffuse moderate or strong staining for thyroid transcription factor-1 with no staining for high molecular weight keratin and p63. In contrast, 27/28 (96%) poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas manifested opposite immunoreactivities, with diffuse moderate or strong staining for high molecular weight keratin and p63, and no or minimal staining for thyroid transcription factor-1. In two additional cases originally interpreted as small cell carcinoma, high molecular weight keratin highlighted small numbers of neoplastic large cells, leading to reclassification as combined small cell and non-small cell carcinomas. p16(INK4A) expression varied widely in poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas, but was consistently moderate or strong and diffuse in small cell carcinomas, and proved helpful in the two thyroid transcription factor-1-negative small cell carcinomas. This study demonstrates that a panel consisting of antibodies to thyroid transcription factor-1, p63, high molecular weight keratin, and p16(INK4A) is highly effective for distinguishing between small cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

Repression of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene products p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) by EBNA3A and EBNA3C is critical for EBV mediated transformation of resting B lymphocytes into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). To define the composition of endogenous EBNA3 protein complexes, we generated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) expressing flag-HA tagged EBNA3A, EBNA3B, or EBNA3C and used tandem affinity purification to isolate each EBNA3 complex. Our results demonstrated that each EBNA3 protein forms a distinct complex with RBPJ. Mass-spectrometry revealed that the EBNA3A and EBNA3B complexes also contained the deubquitylation complex consisting of WDR48, WDR20, and USP46 (or its paralog USP12) and that EBNA3C complexes contained WDR48. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C association with the USP46 complex. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that WDR48 and USP46 are recruited to the p14(ARF) promoter in an EBNA3C dependent manner. Mapping studies were consistent with WDR48 being the primary mediator of EBNA3 association with the DUB complex. By ChIP assay, WDR48 was recruited to the p14(ARF) promoter in an EBNA3C dependent manner. Importantly, WDR48 associated with EBNA3A and EBNA3C domains that are critical for LCL growth, suggesting a role for USP46/USP12 in EBV induced growth transformation.",

Titration experiments showed that homozygous deletion could be detected in the presence of up to 30% normal DNA. Results for cell lines were compatible with previous cytogenetic analyses. Ten cell lines and 32 tumors (38.5%) had homozygous deletion of at least one target. Thirteen tumors (15.7%) had deletion of all three targets. Two tumors had deletion of p14(ARF) exon 1beta alone and four of p16 exon 2 alone. RTQ-PCR detected more homozygous deletions than duplex PCR.

We next tested whether S100A7 was induced by the cell cycle effectors ARF (p14(ARF)), CDKN2A (p16(INK4A)) and TP53 (p53) and found that, although all induced a similar level of acute and permanent cell cycle arrest to telomere dysfunction, none induced S100A7 (except p53 over-expression at high levels), showing that cell cycle arrest is not sufficient for its induction. The closely related transcript S100A15 was also upregulated by telomere dysfunction, to a similar extent by p16(INK4A) and p53 and to a lesser extent by p14(ARF).;Our results show that mere cell cycle arrest, the upregulation of senescence-associated cell cycle effectors and DNA damage are not sufficient for the induction of the S100 transcripts; they further suggest that whilst the induction of S100A15 expression is linked to both telomere-dependent and -independent senescence, S100A7 expression is specifically associated with telomere-dependent senescence in normal keratinocytes.

Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been identified as the major etiological factor in cervical carcinogenesis. However, the time lag between HPV infection and the diagnosis of cancer indicates that multiple steps, as well as multiple factors, may be necessary for the development of cervical cancer. The development and progression of cervical carcinoma have been shown to be dependent on various genetic and epigenetic events, especially alterations in the cell cycle checkpoint machinery. In mammalian cells, control of the cell cycle is regulated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their essential activating coenzymes, the cyclins. Generally, CDKs, cyclins, and CDK inhibitors function within several pathways, including the p16(INK4A)-cyclin D1-CDK4/6-pRb-E2F, p21(WAF1)- p27(KIP1)-cyclinE-CDK2, and p14(ARF)-MDM2-p53 pathways. The results from several studies showed aberrant regulation of several cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin D, cyclin E, p16(INK4A), p21(WAF1), and p27(KIP1), as characteristic features of HPV- infected and HPV E6/E7 oncogene-expressing cervical carcinomas and their precursors. These data suggested further that interactions of viral proteins with host cellular proteins, particularly cell cycle proteins, are involved in the activation or repression of cell cycle progression in cervical carcinogenesis.",

Assembly of active cyclin D-CDK complexes in response to mitogenic signals is negatively regulated by INK4 family members. Here we show that although all four INK4 proteins associate with CDK4 and CDK6 in vitro, only p16(INK4a) can form stable, binary complexes with both CDK4 and CDK6 in proliferating cells. The other INK4 family members form stable complexes with CDK6 but associate only transiently with CDK4. Conversely, CDK4 stably associates with both p21(CIP1) and p27(KIP1) in cyclin-containing complexes, suggesting that CDK4 is in equilibrium between INK4 and p21(CIP1)- or p27(KIP1)-bound states. In agreement with this hypothesis, overexpression of p21(CIP1) in 293 cells, where CDK4 is bound to p16(INK4a), stimulates the formation of ternary cyclin D-CDK4-p21(CIP1) complexes. These data suggest that members of the p21 family of proteins promote the association of D-type cyclins with CDKs by counteracting the effects of INK4 molecules.",

These results suggested the possibility that p16 expression was associated with the progression of ES and RMS. There has been no previous report on p14ARF in NB. Our investigation might indicate that abnormal expression of the p16 and p14ARF was associated with a poor prognosis in NB, although in some cases of NB normal p16 and abnormal p14ARF expression was seen. These findings suggest an important role of p14ARF gene in the tumorigenesis of NB. The different incidence of expression of the p16, p15, and p14ARF genes in these 3 tumor types may reflect differences of the molecular process through which the 3 tumors develop.

New data have shown that ARF interacts with the mitochondrial protein p32/C1QBP and that the interaction is critical in order for ARF to localize to the mitochondria and induce apoptosis. Remarkably, the ARF-p32 interaction, and hence ARF's pro-apoptotic function, can be interrupted by human cancer-derived mutations in exon2 of the p14(ARF)-p16(INK4a) gene locus.

We identified different combinations of pRb and p53 pathway alterations in 12 invasive transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) and addressed the functional significance of the different combinations observed. Results showed four combinations of alterations including -pRb/-p53 (ie., pRb inactivated in the pRb pathway and p53 inactivated in the p53 pathway; four TCCs), -p16/-p53 (four TCCs), -p16/-p21(WAF1) (one TCC), and -p16/ -p14(ARF) (two TCCs). These groups include two new combinations (ie., -p16/-p53 and -p16/-p21(WAF1)) not reported previously for TCCs. An alteration in the key components of the p53 pathway was not detected in one invasive TCC that had inactivated p16. Note that all four TCCs with inactivated pRb had mutant p53; thus, the combinations of -pRb/ -p21(WAF1) and -pRb/-p14(ARF) were not observed. Only two of eight TCCs with altered p16 had concomitant p14(ARF) loss, demonstrating that simultaneous inactivation of these two 9p21INK4a tumor suppressor genes is not obligatory. To determine the biological phenotypes of TCCs with different combinations of pRb and p53 pathway alterations, their downstream responses to gamma radiation were studied in vitro. As expected, none of eight TCCs with mutant p53 responded to gamma radiation by elevation of p53, p21(WAF1), or mdm2 or by cell cycle arrest. Only two of four TCCs with wild-type p53 and wild-type pRb (the combination of -p16/-p14(ARF)) showed normal downstream responses to gamma radiation and underwent cell cycle arrest. Two TCCs with wild-type pRb and wild-type p53 (the combination of -pl6/-p21(WAF1) and one TCC with -p16) failed to show cell cycle arrest in response to radiation. This was attributed to the absence of p21(WAF1) in one TCC. In summary, these data support a model of invasive bladder cancer pathogenesis in which both the pRb and p53 pathways are usually inactivated and the biology of the tumor is impacted by the mechanism of their inactivations.",

This is associated with a reduction in growth fraction, senescent cellular morphology, and increased expression of the cell proliferation inhibitors p16(INK4a), p19(ARF), and p15(INK4b). Deletion of INK4a/ARF (encoding p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF)) completely rescued the defective proliferation of Cited2(-/-) fibroblasts. However, the deletion of INK4a/ARF did not rescue the embryonic malformations observed in Cited2(-/-) mice, indicating that INK4a/ARF-independent pathways are likely to be involved here. We found that Cited2(-/-) fibroblasts had reduced expression of the polycomb-group genes Bmi1 and Mel18, which function as INK4a/ARF and Hox repressors. Complementation with CITED2-expressing retrovirus enhanced proliferation, induced Bmi1/Mel18 expression, and decreased INK4a/ARF expression.

Current techniques for the clinical diagnosis of HPV-associated HNSCC will also be discussed, that is, the detection of HPV DNA, RNA, and the HPV surrogate marker, p16 in tumor tissues, as well as HPV-specific antibodies in serum. Such methods do not allow for the early detection of HPV-associated HNSCC and most cases are at an advanced stage upon diagnosis. Novel noninvasive approaches using oral fluid, a clinically relevant biological fluid, allow for the detection of HPV and cellular alterations in infected cells, which may aid in the early detection and HPV-typing of HNSCC tumors. Noninvasive diagnostic methods will enable early detection and intervention, leading to a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity associated with HNSCC. ",

The gene has been shown to be deleted or mutated in high frequency in human melanoma cell lines and familial melanoma patients, suggesting that it could be a melanoma suppressor gene. How these observations are related to tumorigenicity and metastasis of human melanoma is not clear however. To test the role of CDKN2 in human melanoma metastasis, 14 human melanoma cell lines with different metastatic abilities in nude mice were analysed for possible abnormalities in the CDKN2 gene. Homozygous deletions that resulted in a lack of gene expression were found in six of 14 cell lines tested. SSCP-direct sequencing revealed point mutations in three other cell lines. One cell line displayed CC to TT transitions which constitute a hallmark of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. Overall, abnormalities in the CDKN2 gene were found in nine of 14 (64%) cell lines tested. Homozygous deletion and lack of gene expression were found in several low tumorigenic and nonmetastatic melanoma lines, whereas other metastatic cells did not exhibit abnormalities in the CDKN2 gene. These data suggest that the absence of normal CDKN2 does not confer growth advantage to melanoma cells in vivo and that the production of metastasis by human melanoma cells can occur in the absence of CDKN2 gene abnormalities.",

We have demonstrated previously that Ink4a/Arf-null colon tumors display increased growth and vascularity in C57Bl6 mice carrying the Min (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mutation. We present here an analysis in a mixed genetic background of Min colon tumors (N=215) in mice with or without selective deficiencies in p16 or Arf, respectively. Absence of Arf did not significantly alter tumor formation. In contrast, tumors in mice lacking p16 were moderately larger and redder. Histological analysis demonstrated that these tumors contained significantly more pockets of necrosis (p=0.02), a marker of carcinoma in situ; less apoptosis (p=0.02); and higher red blood cell density (p=0.02, 0.006 within vessels). Biochemical analyses demonstrated increased levels of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF, p<0.01). Exogenous p16 expression in human colon tumor cells in vitro inhibited VEGF production.

In order to study the effects of p14ARF expression in tumor cells, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing p14ARF cDNA (Adp14ARF). Adp14ARF infection of U2OS osteosarcoma cells which has wild type p53 and mutant p14ARF revealed high levels of p14 (ARF) expression within 24h. In addition, Adp14ARF-mediated expressing of p14 (ARF) was associated with increased levels of p53, p21, and mdm2 protein. Growth inhibition assays following Adp14ARF infection demonstrated that the growth of U2OS cells was inhibited relative to infection with control virus. Furthermore, TUNEL analysis as well as PARP cleavage assays demonstrated that Adp14ARF infection was associated with increased apoptosis in U2OS cell line and that it was associated with Adp14ARF induced overexpression of Fas and Fas-L. Addition of Fas-L neutralizing antibody NOK-1 decreased Adp14-mediated cell death, indicating that p14 (ARF) induction of the Fas pathway is associated with increased apoptosis. The finding that Adp14ARF infection did not induce Fas expression in U2OS/E6 and MCF/E6 cells suggests that wild type p53 expression may be necessary for Adp14ARF-mediated induction of Fas. The observation that overexpression of p53 by Adp53 infection in MCF-7 does not induce increased Fas protein levels nor apoptotic cell death suggests that p53 overexpression is required but not sufficient enough for apoptosis. These studies suggest there are other mechanisms other than induction of p53 in ARF-mediated apoptosis and gene therapy using Adp14ARF may be a promising treatment option for human cancers containing wild type p53 and mutant or deleted p14 expression.",

This is particularly important in light of the increase of endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma and the decrease in incidence of squamous cell carcinoma. P16(INK4a) , a member of the INK4 family of cell cycle regulatory proteins, plays a critical role. It functions as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and differentiation by controlling the activity of the tumor-suppressor protein retinoblastoma (pRb), which regulates the cell cycle. Its expression is variable according to the tumoral histotype and in metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate P16(INK4a) expression in endocervical, endometrial, and metastatic ADCs of extra-uterine origin. Fifty gynaecological biopsies (cervix or endometrium) comprised the study for P16(INK4a) determination. Cases were classified as (1) diffuse positive (P), in intense nuclear immunostaining and/or cytoplasmic in > 30% of neoplastic cells; (2) focal positive (FP), in intense immunostaining in 10% to 30% in isolated cells or small groups; and (3) negative (N), in absence of immunostaining or weak, sporadic immunostaining in < 10% of neoplastic cells. Included in the study were the following: 6 endocervical ADCs, 11 endometrioid-type endometrial ADCs, 5 endometrial serous papillary ADCs, 7 ovarian ADCs, 4 large intestine ADCs, 1 breast ADC, 12 not-otherwise-specified (NOS) ADCs, and 4 endocervical biopsy without atypia (as control). Diffuse, strong positivity with P16(INK4a) suggests an endocervical rather than an endometrial or metastatic ADC. In fact, a P16(INK4a) positive immunostaining pattern was prevalent in endocervical (83%) and serous papillary ADCs of endometrial or ovarian origin, whereas endometrioid ADCs such as metastatic non-ovarian lesions generally presented only focal or negative immunostaining. 10/12 cases of ADC-NOS were reclassified using P16(INK4a) immunostaining: 2 as endocervical ADCs (2 P), 4 as endometrioid-type endometrial ADCs (2 FP, 2 N), 3 as endometrial serous papillary ADCs (3 FP), and 1 as ovarian serous papillary ADC (1 FP).",

Inactivation of the related p15(INK4b) gene has also been identified in a number of tumors and cell lines, however, its role as an independent tumor suppressor remains to be elucidated. Chemically-induced tumors in the Syrian Golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) have been shown to be excellent representative models for the comparative development and progression of a number of human malignancies. The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of the p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes in two experimental hamster models for human pancreatic and oral carcinogenesis. First, hamster p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. The hamster p16(INK4a) cDNA open reading frame (ORF) shares 78%, 80%, and 81% identity with the human, mouse, and rat p16(INK4a) sequences, respectively. Similarly, the hamster p15(INK4b) cDNA ORF shares 82% and 89% sequence identity with human and mouse p15(INK4b), respectively. Second, a deletion analysis of hamster p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes was performed for several tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic hamster cell lines and revealed that both p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) were homozygously deleted in a cheek pouch carcinoma cell line (HCPC) and two pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (KL5B, H2T), but not in tissue matched, non-tumorigenic cheek pouch (POT2) or pancreatic (KL5N) cell lines. These data strongly suggest that homozygous deletion of the p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes plays a prominent role in hamster pancreatic and oral tumorigenesis, as has been well established in correlative studies in comparable human tumors. Furthermore, this study supports the comparative importance of the hamster pancreatic and cheek pouch models of carcinogenesis in subsequent mechanistic-, therapeutic-, and preventive-based studies aimed at providing important translational data applicable to pancreatic adenocarcinoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma in humans.",

In addition, loss of heterozygosity in several chromosomal regions is frequently observed, suggesting that other tumor suppressor genes not yet identified could be involved in the tumorigenic process of head and neck cancers. The exact temporal sequence of the genetic alterations during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) development and progression has not yet been defined and their diagnostic or prognostic significance is controversial.

Inactivation of p16 is a common finding in many cancers; however, there is little data on CDKN2A gene abnormalities in oral precancer. In this longitudinal study, we examined changes in the CDKN2A gene locus in sequential epithelial dysplasias and oral carcinomas from 11 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from laser-microdissected lesional tissue, and exons 1alpha, 1beta, and 2 were analyzed by duplex PCR. Immunohistochemistry was done to identify p16 and p14ARF protein expression. Two adjacent polymorphic microsatellite markers were used for allelotyping. Homozygous deletion of exon 1alpha was identified in 2 of 17 (12%) precancerous lesions. Loss of either exon 1alpha, exon 2, or both was seen in seven of nine (78%) carcinomas. In five of these carcinomas, there was loss of only exon 1alpha. No case showed deletion of exon 1beta. In 5 of 11 patients, microsatellite markers showed differing patterns of allelic imbalance in the precancerous lesions and the subsequent carcinoma, suggesting a complex genetic pattern of progression from dysplasia to carcinoma. We conclude that during oral carcinogenesis homozygous deletion of exon 1alpha of the CDKN2A gene is common but that deletion of exon 2 and 1beta is less frequent. Moreover, our results suggest that the progression from oral precancer to cancer, in some cases, is more complex genetically than predicted by linear models of carcinogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Eukaryotic cell division is regulated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI). Genes encoding these proteins are mutated or deleted in many types of cancer. For example, 20%-30% of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) have deletions in the CKI known as INK4a. The contribution of INK4a deletions to the progression of B-lineage ALL is uncertain, partially due to a paucity of data on expression in normal B-cell precursors. We therefore conducted a comparative analysis of normal and leukemic human B-cell development for the expression of cyclins, CDK, and CKI. Specific stages of human B-cell development from normal bone marrow were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The sorted populations and B-lineage ALL cell lines (BLIN-1, 2, 3, 4) were examined for expression of cyclins, CDK, and CKI by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting.RT-PCR analysis showed that cyclin D2, cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6 were ubiquitously expressed in normal B-cell development and in the BLIN ALL cell lines. The p19(INK4d) CKI was the most commonly expressed member of the INK4 family, whereas p16(INK4a) was more weakly and variably expressed. Expression of the p57(KIP2) CKI varied as a function of the stage of B-cell development. Analysis of normal B-cell precursors by Western blotting indicated that CDK4, CDK6, p19(INK4d), and p57(KIP2) were expressed, whereas p16(INK4a) was not detected. Cyclin D/CDK expression in normal and leukemic human B-cell precursors is similar to expression of these proteins in human and murine mature B cells. In contrast, the ubiquitous expression of p19(INK4d) has not been previously described in human or murine B-lineage cells. Our results suggest that loss of INK4a may only minimally contribute to tumor cell progression in B-lineage ALL, since expression of INK4d could provide a compensatory function as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.",

Fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and solution phase PCR were used for specific HPV typing.;p16(INK4A) immunoreactivity was absent in all normal cervical tissues examined.

This study investigates the frequency of HPV infection, p16 and p53 tumour profile and mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten RNA Associated Rat Sarcoma 2 Virus (KRAS) and B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (BRAF) genes in tonsillar and non-tonsillar HNSCCs and correlates with clinical outcome and histopathological parameters in previously unstudied cohort of patients.;A retrospective clinical study was performed utilising the demographic data and pathological specimens from 60 out of 726 head and neck cancer patients. Smoking and alcohol history, tumour staging, treatment and outcomes were recorded. Histopathology and immunochemistry for p16 and p53 was performed and HPV DNA was detected with polymerase chain reaction. Genomic DNA from all cancers were analysed for somatic mutations of EGFR, BRAF and KRAS genes.;20 (33%) of 60 cases were tonsillar squamous carcinomas and 38 (66%) were non-tonsillar. 19 (95%) of the 20 tonsillar cancers and three (8%) of 38 non-tonsillar patients were patients who were HPV 16-positive. Nine (47%) of the 19 HPV 16-positive tonsillar cases were p16 positive. Gene mutations were rare. There was a statistically significant (P < 0.05) improved survival of patients with HPV positive tonsillar tumours, younger age and non-smokers.;Although limited in numbers, this study reinforces the role of HPV infection in HNSCC and its association with a more favourable clinical course in younger non-smokers worldwide. Gene mutation frequencies were low in all cancers tested and routine testing not recommended.",

The authors compared the ability of p16(INK4a) and HR HPV detection by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) to detect the presence of significant cervical disease. METHODS.: Four hundred ThinPrep specimens (100 each in 4 categories: 100 specimens that were negative for intraepithelial lesions, 100 specimens of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], 100 specimens of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [LSILs], and 100 specimens of HSILs) were analyzed. p16(INK4a) protein was immunolocalized using a specific monoclonal antibody, and the detection of HR HPV in all 400 specimens was determined using HC2.;p16(INK4a) was found to be positive in 78% of HSIL specimens, 42% of LSIL specimens, and 36% of ASC-US specimens; whereas HC2 was positive in 92% of HSIL specimens, 81% of LSIL specimens, and 45% of ASC-US specimens. In the HSIL category, the sensitivity, which was calculated using Grade 2 or greater cervical intraepithelial neoplasia as the endpoint, was 78% (50 of 66 specimens) for p16(INK4a) and 91% (60 of 66 specimens) for HC2. For LSIL, the sensitivity was 75% (3 of 4 specimens) for p16(INK4a) and 100% (4 of 4 specimens) for HC2. In the ASC-US category, the sensitivity was 89% (8 of 9 specimens) for p16(INK4a) and 100% (9 of 9 specimens) for HC2. Overall, the sensitivity for HSIL was 92% for HC2 and 78% for p16(INK4a). The specificity for HC2 was 8.3% for HSIL, 16.9% for LSIL, and 48.7% for ASC-US; whereas the specificity for p16(INK4a) was 25% in HSIL, 59.1% in LSIL, and 68.4% in ASC-US. The overall specificity was 25% for HC2 and 56% for p16(INK4a).;Although both p16(INK4a) and HC2 may aid in the clinical management of patients with clinically significant lesions, HC2 was found to have greater sensitivity, and p16(INK4a) greater specificity. The labeling of normal cells and bacteria may preclude the use of p16(INK4a) in automated screening or nonmorphologic assays.",

In this study, we sought to provide direct genetic evidence of a role for the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor gene, encoding both p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf), in modulating the cellular and tissue phenotypes associated with telomere dysfunction by using the mTerc Ink4a/Arf mouse model. In contrast to the rescue associated with p53 deficiency, Ink4a/Arf deficiency did not attenuate the degenerative phenotypes elicited by telomere dysfunction in the late-generation mTerc-/- mice. Furthermore, in contrast to accelerated cancer onset and increased epithelial cancers of late-generation mTerc-/- p53 mutant mice, late-generation mTerc-/- Ink4a/Arf mutant mice experienced a delayed tumor onset and maintained the lymphoma and sarcoma spectrum. Consistent with the negligible role of Ink4a/Arf in the telomere checkpoint response in vivo, late-generation mTerc-/- Ink4a/Arf-/- tissues show activated p53, and derivative tumor cell lines sustain frequent loss of p53 function, whereas all early generation mTerc Ink4a/Arf-/- tumor cell lines remain intact for p53. In addition, the late-generation mTerc-/- Ink4a/Arf-/- tumors showed activation of the alternative lengthening of telomere mechanism, underscoring the need for adaptation to the presence of telomere dysfunction in the absence of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf). These observations highlight the importance of genetic context in dictating whether telomere dysfunction promotes or suppresses age-related degenerative conditions as well as the rate of initiation and type of spontaneous cancers.",

Interestingly, the levels of p19ARF are strongly upregulated in murine cells even at low concentrations of HDACis. Using ARF-deficient cells, we have demonstrated that p19ARF plays an active role in HDACi-triggered cytostasis and the contribution of p19ARF to this arrest is of higher magnitude than that of the well established HDACi target p21Waf1/Cip. Moreover, chemically induced fibrosarcomas in ARF-null mice are more resistant to the therapeutic effect of HDACis than similar tumors in wild type or p21Waf1/Cip-null mice.

The locus harbors the CDKN2A/ARF tumor suppressor gene, which encodes two cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin dependent kinase 2A (p16(INK4a)) and alternate reading frame (p14(ARF)). We have designed a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) application to study homozygous deletion (HD) of CDKN2A/ARF in 186 urinary bladder cancer patients.;Real-time QPCR, based on simultaneous amplification of ARF and a reference gene, GAPDH, was developed and evaluated in three melanoma cell lines with HDs at the CDKN2A/ARF locus (IGR-1, SK-MEL-5, and WM-266-4). In addition, loss of heterozygosity was analyzed at the D9S942, D9S1748, and D12S99 markers. Mutation analysis of the CDKN2A/ARF gene was performed using single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. Results from the present investigation were combined with previous p53 analysis of the same urinary bladder neoplasms.;Real-time QPCR analysis showed 26 (14%) HDs, 22 (12%) hemizygous deletions, and 3 (2%) multiple duplications. Loss of heterozygosity was determined in 30 (22%) cases at the D9S942 locus, which is located between E1alpha and E1beta of the CDKN2A/ARF gene. No association was established between occurrence of genetic aberrations at 9p21 and tumor stage or grade, supporting previous suggestions that CDKN2A/ARF inactivation is an early event in bladder carcinogenesis.;We have established a fast and efficient method for detection of HDs. Our data support the notion that inactivation, including HDs, of CDKN2A/ARF is an early event in transitional cell carcinoma. We observed separate and specific targeting of the CDKN2A and ARF genes, respectively, and that simultaneous inactivation of ARF and p53 occurs.",

The p16(INK4a) member of the INK4 protein family is altered in a variety of cancers and structure-function studies of the INK4 proteins reveal that the vast majority of missense tumor-derived p16(INK4a) mutations reduce protein thermodynamic stability. Based on this observation, we used p18(INK4c) as a model to test the proposal that INK4 proteins with increased stability might have enhanced cell cycle inhibitory activity. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to prepare p18(INK4c) mutant proteins with a predicted increase in stability. Using this approach, we report the generation of three mutant p18(INK4C) proteins, F71N, F82Q, and F92N, with increased stability toward thermal denaturation of which the F71N mutant also showed an increased stability to chemical denaturation. The x-ray crystal structures of the F71N, F82Q, and F92N p18INK4C mutant proteins were determined to reveal the structural basis for their increased stability properties. Significantly, the F71N mutant also showed enhanced CDK6 interaction and cell cycle inhibitory activity in vivo, as measured using co-immunoprecipitation and transient transfection assays, respectively. These studies show that a structure-based approach to increase the thermodynamic stability of INK4 proteins can be exploited to prepare more biologically active molecules with potential applications for the development of molecules to treat p16(INK4a)-mediated cancers.",

Compared with melanocytes, p14ARF mRNA reduction and p16INK4A inactivation were frequently noticed. No association between p14ARF promoter methylation and mRNA levels was found, whereas aberrant p16INK4A methylation was associated with gene silencing (p<0.001). Comparative analysis within melanomas of different Breslow's thicknesses showed that drastic reductions in p14ARF and p16INK4A expression appeared at the level of thin/intermediate and intermediate/thick transitions. The effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) on in vivo binding of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and acetyl histone H3/H4 to p14ARF and p16INK4A promoters were tested together with the impact of ectopic expression of p14ARF and p16INK4A on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. SAHA treatment induced H3 and H4 hyperacetylation at the p14ARF promoter followed by increased p14ARF expression, whereas exposure to 5-aza-dC decreased the recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3b at the p16INK4A promoter and reactivated p16INK4A. Studies on promoter-associated di-methyl histone H3 (Lys4) levels ruled out an involvement of this epigenetic trait on p14ARF and p16INK4A expression. The enforced expression of p14ARF or p16INK4A and, even more so, their co-expression, significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Our data pinpoint: i) a frequent impairment of p14ARF and p16INK4A gene expression by epigenetic modifications in melanoma; ii) histone hypoacetylation as the dominant mechanism of p14ARF silencing; and iii) 5' CpG promoter methylation as the major mechanism of p16INK4A gene inactivation.

Here we show that the level of endogenous p14(Arf) and its balance between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm in HeLa cells are exquisitely sensitive to changes in cell morphology and to short-lived perturbations in cell cycle and in nucleolar function such as those induced by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, roscovitine, and the casein kinase II and RNA synthesis inhibitor, DRB. Most remarkably, whereas p14(Arf) predominantly concentrates in the nucleolus of interphase cells and transiently disappears between metaphase and early G1 under normal growth conditions, it massively and reversibly accumulates in the nucleoplasm of postmitotic and S-phase cells upon short-term treatment with roscovitine and, at a lesser extent, DRB. In line with the fact that the nuclear level of p53 reaches a peak between mid-G1 and the G1/S border in p53-expressor cells which lack Arf expression, these results provide a clue that, in p53+/Arf+ cells, Arf proteins might serve both to speed and to amplify p53-mediated responses in conditions and cell cycle periods in which the mechanisms involved in p53 stabilization and activation are not fully operational. They further suggest that human endogenous p14(Arf) might activate p53 pathways in physiologic situations by acting inside the nucleoplasm, especially when normal cell cycle progression and nucleolar function are compromised.",

Here, we address how p19(Arf) exerts this caretaker role using BubR1 progeroid mice lacking p53 or its transcriptional target p21. We show that p53 delays functional decline of skeletal muscle and fat in a p21-dependent fashion by inhibiting p16(Ink4a)-mediated senescence of progenitor cells. Strikingly, p53 also attenuates the formation of cataractous lenses, but here its antiaging effect is p21 independent, as we found p21 to promote senescence of lens epithelial cells and cataract formation. Together, these results demonstrate that p53 counteracts tissue destruction in response to BubR1 insufficiency through diverse mechanisms and uncover a causal link between senescence of the progenitor cell compartment and age-related dysfunction.",

Here we aimed to investigate how the correlation between CtBP2 and p16(INK4A) influenced the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Immunohistochemistry of ESCC tissue sections indicated that the CtBP2 and p16(INK4A) expressions were inversely correlated to each other with a linear regression coefficient of -0.747 (P < 0.05), and Western blot analysis revealed that CtBP2 was higher expressed in tumorous tissues than in adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Either CtBP2 or p16(INK4A) expression was significantly related to histological differentiation (P = 0.016 or 0.001) and to the expression of Ki-67, a proliferating marker (P = 0.006 or 0.02), and patients with higher CtBP2 and lower p16(INK4A) expressions had shorter overall survival. We also observed that CtBP2 modulated the cell proliferation and cell cycle in ECA109 cells, an ESCC cell line, by inhibiting p16(INK4A) . Overexpression or knockdown of CtBP2 in ECA109 cells was found to inhibit or activate the mRNA or protein expression of p16(INK4A) , which in turn altered the cell proliferation and cell cycle in ECA109 cells, as measured by flow cytometry and cell count assay. Additionally, after ECA109 cells silenced for CtBP2 were treated with cisplatin (an anti-ESCC agent), the p16(INK4A) expression was up-regulated, and the cell apoptosis was promoted, thus confirming the repression of p16(INK4A) by CtBP2. Collectively, all results suggested that CtBP2 might contribute to the progression of ESCC through a negative transcriptional regulation of p16(INK4A).",

Apart from their capacity to arrest cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle they have been shown to participate in an increasing number of cellular processes. Given their emerging roles in fundamental physiological as well as pathological processes, it is interesting to explore the diverse roles for the individual INK4 family members in different functions other than cell cycle regulation.

In vivo studies on the chemosensitivity of metastatic melanoma are rare and hampered by poor response rates to systemic chemotherapeutics. Patients who undergo isolated limb infusion (ILI) with cytotoxic drugs show high response rates and are, therefore, a good cohort for studying chemosensitivity in vivo. We used tumors from patients who underwent ILI to study the role of melanoma tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes on melanoma chemosensitivity. Prospectively acquired tumors from 30 patients who subsequently underwent ILI with melphalan and actinomycin-D for metastatic melanoma were investigated for mRNA expression levels of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), and MITFm. The mutation status of B-RAF, N-RAS, and PTEN were also determined. A high percentage of tumors had activating mutations in either B-RAF (15/30) or N-RAS (10/30) and only two tumors carried altered PTEN. High expression of p16(INK4a) and absence of an activating B-RAF mutation independently predicted response to treatment. Further, inducible expression of p16(INK4a) sensitized a melanoma cell line to death induced by melphalan or actinomycin-D.

This consideration is supported by the observation of multiple allelic losses in the coding loci of chromosome 9p21 in squamous cell carcinomas and in dysplastic premalignant lesions. The present study hypothesized that comparable alterations already occur in leukoplakia, which are seen as potential predecessors of oral squamous cell carcinomas and that it is possible to differ leukoplakia with from leukoplakia without further malignant transformation. Furthermore we evaluated, whether such leukoplakia show sequence alterations in the genes p16 and p14ARF, which are capable to cause a limitation in gene function. The results show that the LOH pattern in genes p16 and p14ARF occur as well in leuplakia with malignant transformation as in leukoplakia, that do not show clinical alterations. The rate of allelic loss did not differ significantly. Overall, the incidence of allelic loss was lower in leuplakia compared to succeeding squamous-cell carcinomas (p<0,05). The results further illustrated an increase in LOH patterns in dyplastic leukoplakia, without reaching statistical significance. Significant increases in allelic losses were found in heavy smokers, (p < 0,05). PCR analysis of the exons 1-alpha, exon 1-beta and exon 2 in leukoplakia, containing LOH patterns did not show genetic alterations. Thus we concluded, that gene deletion and gene mutation have a minor role in the inactivation process of p16 and p14ARF in oral leukoplakia. Representing an early process in carcinogenesis, gene deletion and mutation occur in leukoplakia with and without malignant transformation. Therefore, taken as a singular parameter they represent an uncertain criteria to assess the potential of malignant transformation.

We also quantified the relative expression levels and DNA copy numbers of these genes in seven cell lines and 17 fresh tumors by real-time quantitative PCR. Expression of MET was detected in all samples; however, more than 10-fold difference was found in the samples with higher or lower expression level, despite a normal DNA copy number. The protein expression level was consistent with that of mRNA, and in cell lines with a higher expression level, MET was constitutively activated. Notably, the expression level of MET was significantly higher in patients who died (P = 0.02), in patients with stage IV (P = 0.04), as well as in patients with PAX3-FKHR chimeric transcript (P = 0.04).

Over the past decade there has been a rising incidence of HPV-related HNSCC, but it is not known if this escalation has had any impact on trends relating to brain involvement. Cases of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to the brain were identified from a computerized search of the surgical pathology files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1985 and 2012. The medical records were reviewed to document primary site of tumor origin, treatment, and patient outcome. P16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridization were performed on those metastases arising from the head and neck. Of the 38 metastatic SCCs, 7 (18 %) originated in the head and neck. HPV-16 was detected in 4 (57 %) of the metastatic HNSCCs. All 4 HPV-positive metastases were from oropharyngeal primaries. The time from treatment of the primary to development of the brain metastasis ranged from 19 to 57 months (mean, 45). Following aggressive treatment (surgery and radiation), two patients died of disease progression (7 and 34 months), and two are alive with recurrent brain metastases (4 and 10 months). Although HPV positivity is regarded as a favorable prognostic indicator, it does not safeguard from spread to the brain. In our experience, just over half of the HNSCCs that metastasized to the brain were HPV-related. The potential for developing a brain metastasis long after curative therapy argues for extended patient follow-up.

In order to test for somatic mutations in the CDK4I gene in tumors, DNAs from 30 surgically resected melanomas of both cutaneous and uveal origins were sequenced. No mutations were detected in the coding region of the CDK4I gene, while mutations or deletions were detected in 60% (9 of 15) of the cultured melanoma cell line DNAs. Among presumptive familial cases, nine of which were members of families with one or two other documented melanoma cases, no germline mutations were detected by sequence analysis. A deletion in the second exon of the CDK4I gene was found in one germline allele of a familial melanoma patient from a family with eight affected first degree relatives. These results not only support the suggestion that the CDK4I gene is a familial malignant melanoma gene, they also suggest the presence of another suppressor gene locus within 9p21 which is the target of loss of heterozygosity in sporadic melanomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inactivation of the p16 tumor suppressor gene is a common phenomenon in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Less commonly described is the observation of p16 overexpression in SCCHN. Since overexpression of p16 is a potent predictor of outcome in other cancers, we were interested in determining the level of expression of p16 in our SCCHN specimens as a prerequisite to later prognostic studies. We were also interested in determining the mutational status of p16 in these tumors, in order to determine whether the combination of overexpression and gene alteration may predict a different clinical outcome from overexpression alone. A total of 84 specimens of SCCHN were selected for study. These specimens were obtained from all major sites within the oral cavity, oropharynx, pharynx and larynx. The level of expression of p16 in SCCHN specimens was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In 35 cases, RNA was also isolated from matched normal tissue obtained from a negative tumor margin. In the other 49 cases, the expression level was compared with the level of expression measured in pooled normal RNA obtained from 10 specimens of normal epithelial tissue. Overexpression of p16 was documented when the level of expression in the tumor specimen was 2-fold or greater above the level of expression found in normal tissue. A total of 46 specimens demonstrated overexpression of p16 (55%). All specimens demonstrating overexpression were then subject to sequence analysis. Thirty specimens (65%) showed p16-specific gene alterations, ranging from intragenic deletions to single point mutations, and 15 of these cases concomitantly affect p14ARF. A single specimen demonstrated a silent point mutation within the p16 reading frame. This mutation produces a stop codon at residue 85 in the context of the p14ARF reading frame, predicting premature termination of p14ARF within a previously determined nucleolar localization signal. This observation suggests that in some cases at least, p14ARF may be a selective target for alteration, independently of p16. Analysis of a normal tissue specimen obtained from a negative tumor margin, and a blood sample obtained approximately five years after surgery indicate that this p14ARF-specific alteration may represent a germline mutation.",

ARF proteins interact with the E2F-1, -2 and -3 transcription activators to inhibit their transcriptional activity and induce their degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. The impact of ARF on the E2F proteins may provide a mechanism for p53-independent ARF activity on cell cycle progression and tumor susceptibility. In this report we explored the effects of ARF on E2F ubiquitination and degradation in relationship to cell cycle effects and p53 status. We now show that ARF induced the rapid ubiquitination and degradation of E2F-1 only in the presence of functional p53. E2F-1 continued to be ubiquitinated following ARF induction in cycling p53-wild-type, p21-null cells, showing that effects of ARF were not simply a result of p14ARF induced cell-cycle arrest. Importantly, these data establish that the ARF-E2F-1 pathway is an extension of the p53-mdm2-ARF tumor suppressor network and is unlikely to constitute a p53-independent pathway for ARF function.",

However, patients with a unique subset of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated HNSCC have been documented to have a better survival outcome. These tumors occur more frequently in the tonsils and oropharyngeal sites, among younger patients, higher socioeconomic group, and those exposed to more sexual partners and oral sex compared with HPV-negative HNSCC. Although tobacco- and alcohol-related HNSCCs appear to be on the decline, tonsillar and oropharyngeal HPV-associated tumors seem to be on the rise, and their prevalence varies widely in published reports, ranging from 20% to 60%. Human papilloma virus detection methods in tumor tissue vary and include polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization (ISH) technique for HPV DNA, and E6/E7 messenger RNA, with p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a surrogate marker. The sensitivity and specificity of the different methods used are likely contributory factors to this wide variation. This study compares the p16 IHC staining patterns in HNSCC and laryngeal papillomas and assesses the concordance of p16 and high-risk HPV-ISH to determine the usefulness of p16 as a first-line marker. Using an objective criterion of diffuse intense confluent staining pattern as definite positive (akin to the 3+ of HER2/neu in breast cancer) and focal scattered staining pattern as equivocal reaction requiring confirmatory HPV assay, p16 IHC expression shows good concordance with high-risk HPV-ISH and can be used as a first-line marker.

The methylation status and histological features of the specimens were investigated.;In histologically normal squamous mucosa, no to low-level methylation (0-22%) was noted in some specimens at all genes except RARbeta2 (50%). Considerable variation in the incidence of methylation of these genes within and between cell lines and tumor specimens was noted. The highest incidences of methylation in the cell lines and primary tumors were noted in RARbeta2 (53%), MGMT (37%), p16 (33%), and DAP-K (25%); low incidence of methylations were noted in E-cadherin (2%), p73 (2%) RASSF1A (10%), and p14 (20%) genes. The incidences of methylation of each gene were almost similar between the HNSC cell lines and primary cancer specimens, although methylation of RASSF1A was observed in cell line (26%), but not in dysplasia and primary tumor. RARbeta, p16, and MGMT genes showed the highest incidences of methylation in premalignant and invasive carcinomas.;Methylation of p16, RARbeta, and MGMT may constitute early events in HNSC tumorigenesis.

Evidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, particularly HPV 16, is frequently found in non-keratinizing oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Immunoreactivity for p16, a surrogate marker for HPV infection, often parallels the HPV infection status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the incidence and correlation between p16 expression and HPV infection in high-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma is unknown. Sixteen cases of high-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma, three cases of dedifferentiated adenoid cystic carcinoma and eight cases of low-/intermediate-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma were identified for inclusion in the study. All cases were tested by immunohistochemistry for p16 expression and in situ hybridization for high- and low-risk HPV. Eight cases (100%) of low-to-intermediate-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma were focally positive for p16, all of which were negative for HPV. In all, 14 of 16 cases (88%) of high-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma and three cases (100%) of dedifferentiated adenoid cystic carcinoma were positive for p16; strong and diffuse staining was noted in three cases (3 of 19, 16%). Two cases (11%) of high-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma, which were also diffusely positive for p16, showed the presence of high-risk HPV. These findings suggest that the presence of HPV infection in high-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma is infrequent, even in the presence of p16 immunostaining. Nevertheless, HPV positivity should not be used to exclude the possibility of high-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma when the differential diagnosis includes squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, although p16 overexpression is often used as a surrogate marker for HPV in squamous cell carcinoma, it cannot be used in this manner in high-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma.",

Despite growing interest in the role for senescence during aging of skin and cutaneous carcinogenesis, little is known regarding regulation of three proteins encoded by the INK4a/ARF locus (p12, p14(ARF), p16) in KCs. In this study, several molecular pathways are explored using cultured KCs and KCs freshly isolated from psoriatic plaques. p16 and p14(ARF) are predominantly expressed spontaneously when foreskin-derived early-passage KCs undergo confluency-induced premature senescence. Induction of p14(ARF) on confluency occurred with low E2F-1 levels. Suspension of KCs in methylcellulose induced p12 expression. Addition of various cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) or a phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] only induced p16, but not p14(ARF). Confluent KCs up-regulated Ras activity and the downstream signaling involving ERK. Addition of MAPK inhibitor blocked cytokine and TPA-induced p16 expression. Confluency and interferon-gamma induced premature senescence and p16 expression was linked to induction of the transcription factor Egr-1. KCs derived from chronic psoriatic plaques were characterized by enhanced p16, p14(ARF), and p12 expression accompanied by elevated Egr-1 levels. These results demonstrate that multiple and highly divergent stimuli can trigger the senescent checkpoint in human KCs with differential regulation of p16, p14(ARF), and p12. Although abnormal mitogenic signaling by oncogenic Ras is generally cited as being responsible for induction of premature senescence, our findings indicate that a broader perspective is warranted, to include confluency and cytokine-/TPA-induced pathways for KCs.",

In both lines ethanol had no influence on the protein expression of cyclin D1. In contrast, distinct downregulations of p21, p18 and p19 were detectable at the protein level. The p16 protein was not expressed in the SCCHN line and was unchanged in the control line after the addition of ethanol. In these in vitro experiments the marked downregulation of important cell-cycle inhibitors may accelerate progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. The relevance of our findings to in vivo conditions remains speculative, but the observed mechanisms of significantly reduced expression of cell-cycle inhibitor proteins may be involved in the carcinogenesis of head and neck malignancies.",

We studied their mRNA expressions in 41 hematopoietic cell lines and in 137 patients with hematological malignancies; we used a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay. Normal peripheral bloods, bone marrow and lymph nodes expressed little or undetectable p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNAs, which were readily detected in 12 and 17 of 41 cell lines, respectively. Patients with hematological malignancies frequently lacked p16INK4A expression (60/137) and lost p14ARF expression less frequently (19/137, 13.9%). Almost all patients without p14ARF expression lacked p16INK4A expression, which may correspond to deletions of the INK4A/ARF locus. Undetectable p16INK4A expression with p14ARF expression in 41 patients may correspond to p16INK4A promoter methylation or to normal expression status of the p16INK4A gene. All patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) expressed p14ARF while nine of 23 patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) lost p14ARF expression. Patients with ALL, AML or blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia expressed abundant p16INK4A mRNAs more frequently than patients with other diseases (12/33 vs 6/104, P < 0.01). Patients with FL and high p14ARF expression had a significantly shorter survival time while survival for patients with DLBCL and increased p14ARF expression tended to be longer.

Treatment is dictated by the subsequent determination of primary tumor site and stage. However, the primary site remains elusive in some patients even after an exhaustive examination. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is an important etiologic agent for HNSCCs that arise within the oropharynx but less so for tumors from nonoropharyngeal sites. Detection of HPV-16 or a surrogate marker may be useful in localizing tumor origin in patients who present with metastatic HNSCC.;We performed in situ hybridization (ISH) for HPV-16 on lymph node metastases from 68 patients with HNSCC. P16 immunohistochemistry was also performed because HPV-16 integration disrupts the retinoblastoma pathway and induces an overexpression of p16.;HPV-16 was detected in 22 of the 68 (32%) cases by ISH. When stratified by site of origin, HPV-16 was detected in 22 of 31 (71%) metastases from the oropharynx, but in none of the 37 (0%) metastases from other sites (P < 0.001; Fisher's exact). P16 expression was associated with the presence of HPV-16 by ISH: 21 of 22 HPV-16 positive tumors exhibited p16 expression, whereas only 4 of the 46 HPV-16-negative tumors were p16 positive (95% versus 9%; P < 0.001; Fisher's exact). P16 expression in the node metastases also correlated with site of tumor origin: 24 of 31 oropharyngeal tumors were p16 positive, whereas only 1 of 37 nonoropharyngeal tumors was p16 positive (77% versus 3%; P < 0.001; Fisher's exact).;For patients with metastatic HNSCC, detection of HPV-16 is a reliable way to establish origin from the oropharynx, either directly by ISH or indirectly by immunohistochemistry for p16 overexpression.",

To understand whether cytotoxic agents promote molecular aging, we measured expression of p16 (INK4a) and other senescence markers in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.;Blood and clinical information were prospectively obtained from 33 women with stage I to III breast cancer at four time points: before anthracycline-based chemotherapy, immediately after anthracycline-based chemotherapy, 3 months after anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and 12 months after anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Expression of senescence markers p16 (INK4a) and ARF mRNA was determined using TaqMan quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in CD3(+) T lymphocytes, telomere length was determined by Southern analysis, and senescence-associated cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Findings were independently assessed in a cross-sectional cohort of 176 breast cancer survivors enrolled a median of 3.4 years after treatment; 39% previously received chemotherapy. All statistical tests were two-sided.;In prospectively analyzed patients, expression of p16 (INK4a) and ARF increased immediately after chemotherapy and remained elevated 12 months after treatment. Median increase in log2 p16 (INK4a) was 0.81 (interquartile range = 0.28-1.62; Wilcoxon signed-rank P < .001), or a 75% absolute increase in expression, equivalent to the increase observed over 14.7 years of chronological aging. ARF expression was comparably increased (P < .001). Increased expression of p16 (INK4a) and ARF was associated with dose-dense therapy and hematological toxicity. Expression of two senescence-associated cytokines (VEGFA and MCP1) was durably increased by adjuvant chemotherapy. Telomere length was not affected by chemotherapy.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND DESIGN: Cells were transduced via an adenoviral vector with p21 (Ad5CMV-p21), p16 (Ad5CMV-p16), or both. Western blotting was performed to determine duration of expression of the protein products of the transduced p21 and p16 genes. In vitro growth assays and cell cycle analyses were performed on transduced cells.;Transduced gene products were detected up to day 12 after infection. Western blotting showed high levels of p21 and p16 in transduced cells. Growth suppression was observed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines transduced with Ad5CMV-p21, Ad5CMV-p16, or both, but the combination of p21 and p16 did not achieve significantly greater growth suppression than that seen in cells transduced with Ad5CMV-p16 alone. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the percentage of cells arrested at G1 stage in the cells transduced with Ad5CMV-p16 was similar to that in the cells transduced with both Ad5CMV-p21 and Ad5CMV-p16. No significant in vivo growth suppression was observed in tumor nodules treated with Ad5CMV-p16.;Although p21 and p16 are believed to function as cell cycle regulators of cyclin-dependent kinases, we observed no additive or synergistic effect when using them in combination. The expression of transduced p21 and p16 gene products up to days 9 and 12, respectively, was consistent with the growth suppression and cell cycle arrest observed.

To test this assumption, we have examined the effects of DAC in two human cancer cell lines of differing INK4a/ARF promoter methylation status: MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in which INK4a/ARF is unmethylated and normally expressed, and DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells in which INK4a/ARF is methylated and repressed. In MDA-MB-468 cells, DAC induces cytotoxicity in the absence of any detectable increase of p14 or p16 expression, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of p16/p14 expression fails to attenuate DAC cytotoxicity. In DLD-1 cells, DAC demethylates INK4a/ARF and restores both p16 and p14 expression at concentrations that fail to cause detectable growth inhibition or apoptosis; moreover, neither ARF nor INK4a transgene expression inhibits DLD-1 cell growth despite normalization of p14 and p16 expression. These data imply that neither of these cell lines depends on up-regulated expression of INK4a/ARF for DAC cytotoxicity. We propose that optimal anticancer use of this drug will await unambiguous identification of those DAC target genes primarily responsible for triggering growth inhibition, followed by clarification as to whether these upstream events are caused by hypomethylation or DNA damage.",

A variety of mitogenic stimuli upregulate ARF but a direct modulation at the transcriptional level has been reported only for E2F-1. We show here that the ARF promoter is strongly responsive also to E2F2 and E2F3, thus providing a strong support to their suggested role in the induction of apoptosis. Through the usage of both deletion mutants and/or site-directed mutants, we surprisingly found that none of the four putative E2F consensus sites is strictly necessary for the upregulation of ARF expression, as a minimal deletion mutant, lacking all the putative E2F binding sites, is still transactivated by E2F. Moreover, our data suggest that the ARF promoter is regulated by E2F through both direct binding to the promoter sequences and indirectly, probably by being tethered to the ARF promoter by Sp1-like factors.",

The tumor suppressor p16, encoded by the CDKN2/INK4a locus, has been reported mutated in >or=24% of squamous cell carcinomas. Mutations of the p16 gene have also been found in actinic keratoses, the first identifiable lesion in the continuum from normal skin to squamous cell carcinoma. We hypothesized that there may be an appreciable difference in expression of p16 between normal skin, actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Ten actinic keratoses, 10 in situ squamous cell carcinomas, and 10 invasive squamous cell carcinomas were examined using the immunoperoxidase method with antigen retrieval for anti-p16(INK4a) antibody. All 10 actinic keratoses were positive for weak to moderate p16 staining in the lower third to lower half of the epidermis (especially the basal keratinocytes). This staining was significant when compared with the lack of staining seen in normal skin controls. Twenty percent of in situ squamous cell carcinomas had moderate to strong staining in only the lower half to lower two thirds of the epidermis, whereas 70% of the in situ squamous cell carcinomas exhibited full-thickness p16 staining, with no staining in the dermis. Thirty percent of invasive squamous cell carcinomas had full-thickness staining of the in situ component of the lesion, and 100% of invasive squamous cell carcinomas exhibited moderate to strong staining of the invasive component of the lesion. These findings indicate correlation between the increased expression of p16 during the progression of skin from actinic keratosis to in situ squamous cell carcinoma to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. These data may lend further support to the view of the actinic keratosis as a precursor lesion to squamous cell carcinoma.",

This activates the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and, through incompletely understood events, arrests the cell division cycle. To permit biochemical analysis of the arrest, we generated U2-OS osteogenic sarcoma cell clones in which p16 transcription could be induced. In these clones, binding of p16 to cdk4 and cdk6 abrogated binding of cyclin D1, p27(KIP1), and p21(WAF1/CIP1). Concomitantly, the total cellular level of p21 increased severalfold via a posttranscriptional mechanism. Most cyclin E-cdk2 complexes associated with p21 and became inactive, expression of cyclin A was curtailed, and DNA synthesis was strongly inhibited. Induction of p21 alone, in a sibling clone, to the level observed during p16 induction substantially reproduced these effects. Overexpression of either cyclin E or A prevented p16 from mediating arrest. We then extended these studies to HCT 116 colorectal carcinoma cells and a p21-null clone derived by homologous recombination. In the parental cells, p16 expression also augmented total cellular and cdk2-bound p21. Moreover, p16 strongly inhibited DNA synthesis in the parental cells but not in the p21-null derivative. These findings indicate that p21-mediated inhibition of cdk2 contributes to the cell cycle arrest imposed by p16 and is a potential point of cooperation between the p16/pRB and p14(ARF)/p53 tumor suppressor pathways.",

The future numbers of patients with vulvar SCC is expected to rise, mainly because of the proportional increase in the average age of the general population. Two different pathways for vulvar SCC have been put forth. The first pathway is triggered by infection with a high-risk-type Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Integration of the HPV DNA into the host genome leads to the development of a typical vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), accompanied with overexpression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A). This lesion subsequently forms a warty- or basaloid-type SCC. The HPV vaccine is a promising new tool for prevention of this HPV related SCC of the vulva. The second pathway is HPV-independent. Keratinizing SCC develops within a background of lichen sclerosus (LS) through a differentiated VIN. It has a different set of genetic alterations than those in the first pathway, including p53 mutations, allelic imbalances (AI), and microsatellite instability (MSI).

We elucidated genetic determinants underlying tumor escape in a transgenic mouse model of Wnt pathway-driven breast cancer, wherein targeted therapy is simulated by abrogating doxycycline-dependent Wnt1 transgene expression within established tumors. In mice with intact tumor suppressor pathways, tumors typically circumvented doxycycline withdrawal by reactivating Wnt signaling, either via aberrant (doxycycline-independent) Wnt1 transgene expression or via acquired somatic mutations in the gene encoding beta-catenin. Germline introduction of mutant tumor suppressor alleles into the model altered the timing and mode of tumor escape. Relapses occurring in the context of null Ink4a/Arf alleles (disrupting both the p16 Ink4a and p19 Arf tumor suppressors) arose quickly and rarely reactivated the Wnt pathway. In addition, Ink4a/Arf-deficient relapses resembled p53-deficient relapses in that both displayed morphologic and molecular hallmarks of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, Ink4a/Arf deficiency promoted relapse in the absence of gross genomic instability. Moreover, Ink4a/Arf-encoded proteins differed in their capacity to suppress oncogene independence. Isolated p19 Arf deficiency mirrored p53 deficiency in that both promoted rapid, EMT-associated mammary tumor escape, whereas isolated p16 Ink4a deficiency failed to accelerate relapse. Thus, p19 Arf/p53 pathway lesions may promote mammary cancer relapse even when inhibition of a targeted oncogenic signaling pathway remains in force.",

Tissue sections of 81 TSCC were analyzed by HPV 16-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and p16(INK4A)-specific immunohistochemistry. Results were correlated with clinical and demographic data. HPV 16 integration was detected by FISH as punctate signals in 33 out of 81 (41%) TSCC, 32 of which showed p16(INK4A) accumulation. Only 5 out of 48 HPV-negative tumors showed p16(INK4A) immunostaining (p < 0.0001). The presence of HPV furthermore correlates significantly with low tobacco (p = 0.002) and alcohol intake (p = 0.011), poor differentiation grade (p = 0.019), small tumor size (p = 0.024), presence of a local metastasis (p = 0.001) and a decreased (loco)regional recurrence rate (p = 0.039). Statistical analysis revealed that smoking significantly increases the risk of cancer death from TSCC and that non-smoking patients with HPV-containing TSCC show a remarkably better disease-specific survival rate. HPV 16 is integrated in 41% of TSCC and strongly correlates with p16(INK4A) overexpression, implicating the latter to be a reliable HPV biomarker. Patients with HPV-positive tumors show a favorable prognosis as compared to those with HPV-negative tumors, but tobacco use is the strongest prognostic indicator.

Two of these cell cycle inhibitors, p16(INK4A) and p15(INK4B), have tumor suppressor activities and are inactivated in human cancer. Interestingly, both INK4 genes express alternative splicing variants. In addition to p16(INK4A), the INK4A locus encodes a splice variant, termed p12--specifically expressed in human pancreas--and ARF, a protein encoded by an alternative reading frame that acts as a tumor suppressor through the p53 pathway. Similarly, the human INK4B locus encodes the p15(INK4B) tumor suppressor and one alternatively spliced form, termed as p10. We show here that p10, which arises from the use of an alternative splice donor site within intron 1, is conserved in the mouse genome and is widely expressed in mouse tissues. Similarly to mouse p15(INK4B), p10 expression is also induced by oncogenic insults and transforming growth factor-beta treatment and acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. Importantly, we show that mouse p10 is able to induce cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner. We also show that mouse p10 is able to inhibit foci formation and anchorage-independent growth in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and that these antitransforming properties of mouse p10 are also p53-dependent. These results indicate that the INK4B locus, similarly to INK4A-ARF, harbors two different splicing variants that can be involved in the regulation of both the p53 and retinoblastoma pathways, the two major molecular pathways in tumor suppression.",

We investigated bronchial aspirates of patients admitted for suspected lung cancer with regard to the prevalence of aberrant methylation of potential marker genes. Applying quantitative methylation specific PCR (QMSP) we analyzed bronchial aspirates from 75 patients with primary lung cancer and 64 bronchial aspirates of patients diagnosed with benign lung disease for promoter methylation of 3 candidate marker genes (p16(INK4a), RARB2 and SEMA3B). Hypermethylation of p16(INK4a) detected 18/75 (24%) cases with primary lung cancer and was present predominantly in squamous cell carcinomas (14/25; 56%). RARB2 QMSP at an assay threshold greater than 30 was found in 42/75 (56%) patients with lung cancer without relation to histological subtype. Patients with benign lung disease showed methylation of p16(INK4a) and a RARB2 QMSP at an assay threshold greater than 30 in 0/64 (0%) and 8/64 (13%) cases, respectively. Combining the 2 methylation markers, p16(INK4a) and RARB2, yielded a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 87% for the diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy. In contrast, SEMA3B displayed frequent promoter methylation (around 90%) both in bronchial aspirates of tumor and nontumor cases and thus was not suited as a biomarker. The results of this study indicate that QMSP analysis of p16(INK4a) and RARB2 may aid the diagnosis of primary lung cancer in bronchial aspirates. In particular, detection of p16(INK4a) methylation by QMSP may serve as a highly specific marker of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma.",

Methylation of CpG promoter islands has been described as a mechanism of gene silencing. Exon 1 of the p16INK4a gene and the p14ARF promoter gene reside within CpG islands. Therefore, both can become methylated de novo and silenced. It has recently been proposed that the methylation changes in certain genes could be used as molecular markers for the detection of almost all forms of human cancer. Here, we analyzed concomitantly in each tumor sample and normal tissue the methylation status of p16INK4a and p14ARF by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in 100 breast, 95 colon and 27 bladder carcinomas. A series of clinicopathological parameter were obtained from the medical records of the patients, p14ARF showed a higher rate of hypermethylation than p16INK4a in all three tumor types. p16INK4a and p14ARF aberrant methylation was significantly correlated with poor prognosis clinicopathological parameters of the three tumor types. We conclude that both p16INKa and p14ARF hypermethylation may be involved in breast, colon and bladder carcinogenesis, with special emphasis on the role of the lesser studied p14ARF gene, and that tumors with aberrant methylation in the two genes were associated with worse prognosis.",

Inactivation of p19(Arf) reduces Slug levels, resulting in increased E-cadherin expression and delaying the onset and progression of prostate cancer in Pten/Trp53 double null mice. Mechanistically, p14(ARF) stabilizes SLUG through increased sumoylation at lysine residue 192. Importantly, levels of SLUG and p14(ARF) are positively correlated in human prostate cancer specimens. These data demonstrated that ARF modulates the SLUG/E-cadherin signaling axis for augmenting prostate tumorigenesis in vivo, revealing a novel paradigm where the oncogenic functions of SLUG require ARF to target E-cadherin in prostate cancer.

Here we present a genetic approach to defining the role of p19(ARF) in regulating the apoptotic function of p53 in highly proliferating, homeostatic tissues. In contrast to our expectation, p19(ARF) did not activate the apoptotic function of p53 in lymphocytes or epithelial cells.

For p16(INK4a), the underlying rationale is its role in senescence, but the selective force for inactivation of p18(INK4c) in incipient cancer cells is less clear. Here, we show that in human fibroblasts undergoing replicative or oncogene-induced senescence, there is a marked decline in the levels of p18(INK4c) protein and RNA, which mirrors the accumulation of p16(INK4a). Downregulation of INK4c is not dependent on p16(INK4a), and RAS can promote the loss of INK4c without cell-cycle arrest. Downregulation of p18(INK4c) correlates with reduced expression of menin and E2F1 but is unaffected by acute cell-cycle arrest or inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Collectively, our data question the idea that p18(INK4c) acts as a backup for loss of p16(INK4a) and suggest that the apparent activation of p18(INK4c) in some settings represents delayed senescence rather than increased expression.

Fifty-seven colorectal carcinomas from a consecutive series were investigated. Using DNA from tissue homogenates, p16(INK4a) promoter methylation was seen in 17 of 57 tumors by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and this could be confirmed using DNA from laser-capture microdissected material in 16 of these cases. A total loss of immunohistochemical p16(INK4a) expression was seen in 6 of 17 tumors with promoter methylation. Quantification of immunohistochemical p16(INK4a) expression for the remaining 11 cases revealed statistically lower frequencies of expression as compared with cases without p16(INK4a) promoter methylation. 9p21 allelic loss was observed in 9 cases, but p16(INK4a) expression in these carcinomas was not reduced. Attempted linear regression of p16(INK4a) expression in tumor buds on the degree of tumor budding, as counted on pan-cytokeratin immunostains, did not show a correlation. p16(INK4a) promoter methylation can completely abrogate p16(INK4a) expression in colorectal carcinomas. In many cases, however, it has an appreciable but only modulatory influence on p16(INK4a) expression. Possibly, methylations are heterozygous, and/or mosaic in colorectal carcinomas and/or methylations are not totally stable but can be lost between carcinoma cell replication cycles.

LBC-ThinPrep (Cytyc, USA) cervical cytology samples, prepared and stained by Papanicolaou method, were analyzed using modified Bethesda cytologic classification named \"Zagreb 2002\". A second ThinPrep slide, prepared from the same sample, was immunostained for p16INK4a using CINtec p16INK4a Cytology Kit (DakoCytomation, Denmark). Increased expression of the high-risk (HR) HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes results in a highly specific increase in p16 protein expression and overexpression of p16INK4a acts as a potential biomarker for cervical cancer progression from premalignant lesions. Brown nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining of abnormal cells was considered a positive result. Residual material was used for 13 HR HPV-DNA detection by the PCR based AMPLICOR HPV test (Roche Molecular Systems). A total of 120 ThinPrep Pap tests with the following cytologic diagnoses: 17 within normal limits, 17 atypical squamous cell (ASC) (7 ASC of undetermined significance /ASCUS/ and 10 ASC of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions cannot be excluded /ASC-H/), 26 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) corresponding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 57 high-grade SIL (HSIL) i.e. 24 CIN II and 33 CIN III and 3 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were included in the study.

The p16INK4a biomarker was positive in 87.5% (21/24) of CIN II and 69% (18/26) of CIN I, while the HR HPV was positive in 75% (18/24) of CIN II and 50% (13/26) of CIN I. In ASCUS cytology, p16INK4a and HR HPV showed the same rate of positivity (28.5%; 2/7). Expression of p16INK4a was detected in all cytologic (10/10) ASC-H lesions, in contrast to HR HPV detected in only 20% (2/10) of ASC-H cases. These data suggest the p16INK4a evaluation in ThinPrep cervical samples to be significantly associated with HR HPV testing by PCR in the same sample for the diagnosis of HSIL lesions and cervical carcinomas.

In contrast to reports that suggest an inverse relationship between smoking and global DNA CpG methylation, hypermethylation of promoters of a number of genes was detected in saliva collected from patients with HNSCC. Using a sensitive methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) assay to determine specific methylation events in the promoters of RASSF1A, DAPK1, and p16 genes, we demonstrate that we can detect tumor presence with an overall accuracy of 81% in the DNA isolated from saliva of patients with HNSCC (n = 143) when compared with the DNA isolated from the saliva of healthy nonsmoker controls (n = 31). The specificity for this MSP panel was 87% and the sensitivity was 80% (with a Fisher exact test P < .0001). In addition, the test panel performed extremely well in the detection of the early stages of HNSCCs, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 87%, and a high κ concordance value of 0.8, indicating an excellent overall agreement between the presence of HNSCC and a positive MSP panel result. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the promoter methylation of RASSF1A, DAPK1, and p16 MSP panel is useful in detecting hypermethylation events in a noninvasive manner in patients with HNSCC.",

The p19ARF transcript, an alternative spliced form of the CDKN2a gene, has recently been shown to inhibit, like the p16INK4a protein, cell cycle progression, raising the possibility that it might constitute an additional melanoma tumor suppressor gene at the 9p21 locus. To determine the contribution of these candidate genes to familial melanoma genetic predisposition, we screened 10 such kindreds for germline mutations in the p16INK4a and p19ARF genes. Four independent germline missense mutations, mapping in exon 1alpha (Gly23Asp; Arg24Pro) and exon 2 (Asn71Ileu; Pro114Leu) of the CDKN2a gene, were identified. Two previously described polymorphisms were also detected, Ala148Thr in exon 2 and a base change in the 3' untranslated region of exon 3. No disease-associated mutations in exon 1beta of the p19ARF gene were found. Our data support the hypothesis that the CDKN2a is a melanoma susceptibility gene in familial melanoma, whereas the p19ARF gene does not seem to play a significant role.",

Their correlations with clinical factors, including location of primary sites, T stage, N stage, M stage, HPV status, primary treatment success/failure, recurrences, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival, were analyzed. HIF-1α, HPS70, HPS90, VEGF, and IGF-1R were positive in 33 of 89 (37.1 %), 62 of 87 (71.3 %), 83 of 89 (93.3 %), 41 of 87 (47.1 %), and 50 of 56 (89.3 %) cases, respectively. Expression levels of some of these markers were correlated. High HIF-1α or HSP 70 correlated with poor DFS, and expression of HSP70 correlated with LN metastasis. HPV-related carcinomas showed high HSP 70 and IGF-1R expression. Hypoxia-associated proteins were highly expressed and associated with aggressive clinical features in HNSCC.

Although BRAF(V600E) is the most prevalent oncogene in melanoma, the BRAF(V600E) mutant is not sufficient to induce tumors in vivo. Mutation at the CDKN2A locus is another melanoma-predisposing event that can disrupt the function of both p16(INK4a) and ARF. Numerous studies have focused on the role of p16(INK4a) in melanoma, but the involvement of ARF, a well-known p53 activator, is still controversial. Using a transgenic BRAF(V600E) mouse model previously generated in our laboratory, we report that loss of ARF is able to enhance spontaneous melanoma formation and cause profound sensitivity to neonatal UVB exposure. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) and ARF deletion synergize to inhibit nucleotide excision repair by epigenetically repressing XPC and inhibiting the E2F4/DP1 complex. We suggest that the deletion of ARF promotes melanomagenesis not by abrogating p53 activation but by acting in concert with BRAF(V600E) to increase the load of DNA damage caused by UVR.",

Here we show that Runx2-deficient primary osteoblasts fail to undergo senescence as indicated by the absence of beta-gal activity and p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor expression. Primary Runx2-null osteoblasts have a growth advantage and exhibit loss of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p19(ARF) expression. Reintroduction of WT Runx2, but not a subnuclear targeting-defective mutant, induces both p21(WAF/CIP1) and p19(ARF) mRNA and protein resulting in cell-cycle inhibition. Accumulation of spontaneous phospho-H2A.X foci, loss of telomere integrity and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 DNA repair complex, and a delayed DNA repair response all indicate that Runx2 deficiency leads to genomic instability. We propose that Runx2 functions as a tumor suppressor in primary diploid osteoblasts and that subnuclear targeting contributes to Runx2-mediated tumor suppression.",

Using this system, we generated eight tet-regulated shRNA transgenic lines targeting Firefly and Renilla luciferases, Oct4 and tumor suppressors p53, p16(INK4a), p19(ARF) and APC and demonstrate potent gene silencing and GFP-tracked knockdown in a broad range of tissues in vivo. Further, using an shRNA targeting APC, we illustrate how this approach can identify predicted phenotypes and also unknown functions for a well-studied gene. In addition, through regulated gene silencing we validate APC/Wnt and p19(ARF) as potential therapeutic targets in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and lung adenocarcinoma, respectively.

The use of phenolphthalein in laxatives has decreased since 1997 when the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to withdraw its classification as an over-the-counter drug (21 CFR, Part 310). Phenolphthalein has been previously evaluated in 2-year carcinogenicity studies by the National Toxicology Program (1996). The major route of human exposure to phenolphthalein is via ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation of contaminated air originating from process units manufacturing the compound. In this study, the carcinogenic effects of phenolphthalein were studied in the haploinsufficient p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) mouse model as an ongoing goal of the NTP is to seek model systems for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies, especially those that can provide mechanistic information relative to understanding an agent's mode of action. Male and female haploinsufficient p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) mice were exposed to phenolphthalein (greater than 97% pure) in feed for 27 weeks. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 27-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 15 male and 15 female mice were exposed to 0, 200, 375, 750, 3,000, or 12,000 ppm phenolphthalein (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 35, 65, 135, 540, and 2,170 mg phenolphthalein/kg body weight to males and 50, 90, 170, 680, 2,770 mg/kg to females) in feed for 27 weeks. Survival of all exposed groups of male and female mice was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of males in the 12,000 ppm group were less than those of the control group after week 11. No differences in feed consumption were noted between exposed and control groups. Atypical hyperplasia of the thymus, a premalignant change of chemically induced thymic lymphoma, occurred in exposed males and females, and the incidence was significantly increased in 12,000 ppm females. Atrophy of the seminiferous tubules in the testis, hyperplasia of the testicular interstitial (Leydig) cells, and epididymal hypospermia occurred in most 3,000 and 12,000 ppm males. Additionally, the left and right testis weights, the left epididymis weights, sperm motility, the numbers of spermatid heads per testis, and sperm heads per cauda and per gram cauda epididymis were generally significantly less in 3,000 and 12,000 ppm males than in the control group. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in 3,000 and 12,000 ppm males; incidences of hypertrophy of renal tubules were significantly increased in males receiving 750 ppm or greater. Hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen occurred in all 12,000 ppm males, and the incidences of this lesion were significantly increased in 375, 750, and 12,000 ppm females.;The frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was assessed at four time points during the 27-week study in male and female haploinsufficient p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) mice. Significant concentration-related increases in micronucleated cells were observed at all time points in male and female mice.;Under the conditions of this 27-week feed study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of phenolphthalein in male or female haploinsufficient p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) mice exposed to 200, 375, 750, 3,000, or 12,000 ppm.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is one of the peripheral T-cell malignant neoplasms strongly associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I). Although the viral transactivator protein Tax has been proposed to play a critical role in leukemogeneis, additional cellular events are required for the development of ATL. One of the genetic events of the disease is inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The CDKN2A locus on chromosome 9p encodes 2 cell cycle regulatory proteins, p14ARF and p16INK4a, which share exon 2 using different reading frames. The p14ARF and p16INK4a genes have been implicated as tumor suppressor genes by their frequent mutation, deletion or promoter hypermethylation in a variety of human tumors. In this report, we describe the expression status of p14ARF and p16INK4a in 9 ATL cell lines (MT1, MT2, OKM3T, F6T, K3T, Oh13T, S1T, Su9T01 and HUT102). By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), expression of p14ARF was not detected in one cell line (OKM3T), while expression of p16INK4a was not detected in 6 cell lines (OKM3T, MT1, MT2, Oh13T, S1T and Su9T01). In the OKM3T cell line, the shared exon 2 of the p14ARF/p16INK4a gene was deleted; however, the p16INK4a gene, was epigenetically inactivated in 5 other cells lines. In primary tumor cells obtained from ATL patients, p14ARF expression was absent in 6 of the 11 samples. We confirmed the methylation of the p16INK4a gene in MT1 and MT2 cells using the methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method. Treatment with 2.0 µM of Azacitidine (AZA), a demethylating agent, for 72 h restored p16INK4a transcript expression and induced growth inhibition in MT2 cells. Our results demonstrate that p16INK4a is epigenetically silenced in ATL. AZA offers a potential new therapeutic approach to improve the poor outcomes associated with ATL.",

The series included non-functional adenomas (n=23), prolactinomas (n=6), prolactinoma plus thyroid-stimulating hormone adenoma (n=1), growth hormone adenomas (n=4), and adrenocorticotropic adenoma (n=1). All of the tumours had methylation of at least one of these genes and 40% of samples (14 of 35) displayed concurrent methylation of at least three genes. The frequencies of aberrant methylation were: 20% for RB1, 17% for p14(ARF), 34% for p16(INK4a), 29% for p73, 11% for TIMP-3, 23% for MGMT, 6% for DAPK, 43% for THBS1 and 54% for caspase-8. No aberrant methylation was observed in two non-malignant pituitary samples from healthy controls. Although some differences in the frequency of gene methylation between functional and non-functional adenomas were detected, these differences did not reach statistical significance.

Degree of p16(INK4a) and Ki-67 expression correlated with degree of cervical neoplasia (P <.001) and with presence of high-risk human papillomavirus types (P <.001). There was no relationship between p16(INK4a) overexpression and inflammation or hormonal status. Ki-67 expression correlated with inflammation (P = 0.003) and was expressed in more reactive and atypical lesions than p16(INK4a) (P = 0.008).

Lamin A/C is necessary for the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) stabilization through unknown mechanism(s). Two oncoproteins, gankyrin and MDM2, are known to promote pRB degradation in other contexts. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that gankyrin and/or MDM2 are required for enhanced pRB degradation in Lmna-/- fibroblasts. Principal Findings. To determine if gankyrin promotes pRB destabilization in the absence of lamin A/C, we first analyzed its protein levels in Lmna-/- fibroblasts. Both gankyrin mRNA levels and protein levels are increased in these cells, leading us to further investigate its role in pRB degradation. Consistent with prior reports, overexpression of gankyrin in Lmna+/+ cells destabilizes pRB. This decrease is functionally significant, since gankyrin overexpressing cells are resistant to p16(ink4a)-mediated cell cycle arrest. These findings suggest that lamin A-mediated degradation of pRB would be gankyrin-dependent. However, effective RNAi-enforced reduction of gankyrin expression in Lmna-/- cells was insufficient to restore pRB stability. To test the importance of MDM2, we disrupted the MDM2-pRB interaction by transfecting Lmna-/- cells with p14(arf). p14(arf) expression was also insufficient to stabilize pRB or confer cell cycle arrest, suggesting that MDM2 also does not mediate pRB degradation in Lmna-/- cells.;Our findings suggest that pRB degradation in Lmna-/- cells occurs by gankyrin and MDM2-independent mechanisms, leading us to propose the existence of a third proteasome-dependent pathway for pRB degradation. Two findings from this study also increase the likelihood that lamin A/C functions as a tumor suppressor. First, protein levels of the oncoprotein gankyrin are elevated in Lmna-/- fibroblasts. Second, Lmna-/- cells are refractory to p14(arf)-mediated cell cycle arrest, as was previously shown with p16(ink4a). Potential roles of lamin A/C in the suppression of tumorigenesis are discussed.",

Despite considerable efforts, the 5-year survival rate for HNSCC has not changed significantly. To improve this situation, it is necessary to understand the fundamental biological processes leading to the disease and its progression. In addition to known genetic changes in HNSCC, molecular cytogenetic investigations have identified chromosomal regions of gains and losses, but many of the responsible candidate genes have yet to be identified. Furthermore, recent results indicate the importance of epigenetic modifications in HNSCC, such as DNA methylation. Several genes, including the tumor suppressor CDKN2A and other candidates such as DAPK1, MGMT, TIMP3, TCF21, and C/EBPalpha, have been found to harbor hypermethylated regulatory sequences that lead to reduced expression or gene silencing. Hypermethylation in such genes could be used not only as biomarkers for the early detection of HNSCC but also to improve prevention strategies and therapy outcomes.",

We show that H-RasV12 provokes cell cycle arrest accompanied by accumulation of p53 and p16(INK4a) in immortalized FHL2(-/-) MEFs. These features contrast sharply with Ras transforming activity in wild type cell lines. We further show that establishment of FHL2-null cell lines differs from conventional immortalization scheme by retaining functional p19(ARF)/p53 checkpoint that is required for cell cycle arrest imposed by Ras.

However, the mechanisms on aberrant elevation of ARF in cancers are still poorly understood. We previously showed that ARF (p14ARF in human and p19Arf in mouse) elevation correlates with PTEN loss and stabilizes SLUG to reduce cell adhesion in prostate cancer (PCa). Here we report that ARF is essential for MMP7 expression, E-Cadherin decrease and the anchorage loss to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in PCa in vitro and in vivo. We found that Mmp7 is aberrantly elevated in cytosol and nucleus of malignant prostate tumors of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice. Interestingly, p19Arf deficiency strikingly decreases Mmp7 levels but increases E-Cadherin in Pten/Trp53/p19Arf mice. ARF knockdown markedly reduces MMP7 in human PCa cells. Conversely, tetracycline-inducible expression of ARF increases MMP7 with a decrease of E-Cadherin in PCa cells. Importantly, MMP7 physically binds ARF to show the co-localization in nucleus. Co-expression of MMP7 and ARF promotes cell migration, and MMP7 knockdown decreases wound healing in PCa cells. Furthermore, MMP7 elevation correlates with ARF expression in advanced human PCa. Our findings reveal for the first time that the crosstalk between ARF and MMP7 in nucleus contributes to ECM network in tumor microenvironments in vivo, implicating a novel therapeutic target for advanced PCa treatment.",

In a series of 11 microsatellite stable (MSS) and 9 microsatellite unstable (MSI) colon cancer cell lines and primary colon carcinomas (25 MSS and 28 MSI) with known ploidy stem line and APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutation status, we analyzed the promoter methylation of the following genes: hMLH1, MGMT, p16INK4a (CDKN2A alpha-transcript), p14ARF (CDKN2A beta-transcript), APC, and E-cadherin (CDH1). We compared the DNA methylation profiles of the cell lines with those of the primary tumors. Finally, we examined if the epigenetic changes were associated with known genetic markers and/or clinicopathological variables.;The cell lines and primary tumors generally showed similar overall distribution and frequencies of gene methylation. Among the cell lines, 15%, 50%, 75%, 65%, 20% and 15% showed promoter methylation for hMLH1, MGMT, p16INK4a, p14ARF, APC, and E-cadherin, respectively, whereas 21%, 40%, 32%, 38%, 32%, and 40% of the primary tumors were methylated for the same genes. hMLH1 and p14ARF were significantly more often methylated in MSI than in MSS primary tumors, whereas the remaining four genes showed similar methylation frequencies in the two groups. Methylation of p14ARF, which indirectly inactivates TP53, was seen more frequently in tumors with normal TP53 than in mutated samples, but the difference was not statistically significant. Methylation of p14ARF and p16INK4a was often present in the same primary tumors, but association to diploidy, MSI, right-sided location and female gender was only significant for p14ARF. E-cadherin was methylated in 14/34 tumors with altered APC further stimulating WNT signaling.;The present study shows that colon cancer cell lines are in general relevant in vitro models, comparable with the in vivo situation, as the cell lines display many of the same molecular alterations as do the primary carcinomas. The combined pattern of epigenetic and genetic aberrations in the primary carcinomas reveals associations between them as well as to clinicopathological variables, and may aid in the future molecular assisted classification of clinically distinct stages.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Latent infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is highly associated with the endemic form of Burkitt lymphoma (eBL), which typically limits expression of EBV proteins to EBNA-1 (Latency I). Interestingly, a subset of eBLs maintain a variant program of EBV latency - Wp-restricted latency (Wp-R) - that includes expression of the EBNA-3 proteins (3A, 3B and 3C), in addition to EBNA-1. In xenograft assays, Wp-R BL cell lines were notably more tumorigenic than their counterparts that maintain Latency I, suggesting that the additional latency-associated proteins expressed in Wp-R influence cell proliferation and/or survival. Here, we evaluated the contribution of EBNA-3A. Consistent with the enhanced tumorigenic potential of Wp-R BLs, knockdown of EBNA-3A expression resulted in abrupt cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 that was concomitant with conversion of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) to its hypophosphorylated state, followed by a loss of Rb protein. Comparable results were seen in EBV-immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), consistent with the previous observation that EBNA-3A is essential for sustained growth of these cells. In agreement with the known ability of EBNA-3A and EBNA-3C to cooperatively repress p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) expression, knockdown of EBNA-3A in LCLs resulted in rapid elevation of p14(ARF) and p16I(NK4a). By contrast, p16(INK4a) was not detectably expressed in Wp-R BL and the low-level expression of p14(ARF) was unchanged by EBNA-3A knockdown. Amongst other G1/S regulatory proteins, only p21(WAF1/CIP1), a potent inducer of G1 arrest, was upregulated following knockdown of EBNA-3A in Wp-R BL Sal cells and LCLs, coincident with hypophosphorylation and destabilization of Rb and growth arrest. Furthermore, knockdown of p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in Wp-R BL correlated with an increase in cellular proliferation. This novel function of EBNA-3A is distinct from the functions previously described that are shared with EBNA-3C, and likely contributes to the proliferation of Wp-R BL cells and LCLs.",

However, in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) alterations of the INK4a-ARF tumour suppressor locus are rarely found despite the noted variable p16INK4a mRNA and protein levels. The p14ARF, an alternative reading frame protein encoded from the same INK4a-ARF locus, is a potent tumour suppressor functionally linked to p53. There is little known regarding the role of p14ARF in primary human tumours. Therefore, we analysed the expression patterns of these two tumour suppressors in 37 cases of AML. The relative expression of p16INK4a and p14ARF mRNA in AML blasts, measured by a specific p16INK4a/p14ARF multiplex RT-PCR, was significantly shifted towards p14ARF whereas relatively lower levels of p16INK4a were detected. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed significantly higher expression of both transcripts in AML blasts when compared to normal differentiated myeloid cells or CD34+ progenitor cells. Furthermore, a good correlation between p16INK4a protein and mRNA was observed, whereas no correlation was found with p14ARF. Our results suggest: a) increased levels of both p16INK4a and p14ARF may participate in the pathogenesis of AML, b) that high p14ARF mRNA expression might influence p16INK4a transcription and c) that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are important for p14ARF expression.",

In the present study, the expression pattern of 10 selected cell cycle components is investigated in a series of 15 MPNSTs from patients with (n = 9) or without (n = 5) neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Thirteen tumors did not express the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16(INK4A), an observation that was related to homozygote gene deletions in three tumors, heterozygote deletions in five, and gross gene rearrangements in five. The absence of protein expression in the tumors with one seemingly intact allele was not caused by promoter hypermethylation of p16(INK4A) or p14(ARF). All tumor samples expressed normal sized RB1, cyclin D3, CDK2, CDK4, p21(CIP1), and p27(KlP1) proteins, and only a single tumor showed an aberrant protein band for one of these proteins, p21(CIP1). Cyclin D1 was absent in four tumors; all except one tumor showed expression of TP53 protein, and three of nine MPNSTs had expression of normal-sized MDM2. In conclusion, this study shows that the vast majority of MPNSTs had gross rearrangements of the p16(INK4A) gene, explaining the absence of the encoded protein in the same tumors. The level of expression was equally distributed between the familial (NF1) and sporadic cases, although it should be noted that the 2 cases with p16(INK4A) expression were sporadic. The data imply that the complete absence of p16(INK4A) is sufficient for activation of the cell cycle in most MPNSTs; thus, it is not necessary for tumor proliferation to further stimulate the cycle through alteration of other central components.",

We subsequently identified Bmi-1 as a transcriptional repressor belonging to the mouse Polycomb group. The Polycomb group comprises an important, conserved set of proteins that are required to maintain stable repression of specific target genes, such as homeobox-cluster genes, during development. In mice, the absence of bmi-1 expression results in neurological defects and severe proliferative defects in lymphoid cells, whereas bmi-1 overexpression induces lymphomas. Here we show that bmi-1-deficient primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts are impaired in progression into the S phase of the cell cycle and undergo premature senescence. In these fibroblasts and in bmi-1-deficient lymphocytes, the expression of the tumour suppressors p16 and p19Arf, which are encoded by ink4a, is raised markedly. Conversely, overexpression of bmi-1 allows fibroblast immortalization, downregulates expression of p16 and p19Arf and, in combination with H-ras, leads to neoplastic transformation. Removal of ink4a dramatically reduces the lymphoid and neurological defects seen in bmi-1-deficient mice, indicating that ink4a is a critical in vivo target for Bmi-1.

We evaluated the expression of the tumour suppressors p14, p16 and p53 in pre-malignant and malignant squamous skin tumours, and its relation with risk factors for skin carcinogenesis (HPV, immune status and sun exposure). We performed immunohistochemical stainings for p14, p16 and p53 on paraffin embedded material of 71 pre-malignant squamous skin lesions and 34 squamous cell carcinomas, from 52 renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and 53 immunocompetent individuals. PCR-based assays were used for detection and genotyping of beta-papilloma virus (beta-PV) types and mucosal HPV types. P14 expression was independent of the expression of p16 and p53, irrespective of immune status and skin site. In 49 of 105 specimens (46.6%), one or more beta-PV types were detected. We found no significant association between p14, p16 or p53 protein expression and overall presence of beta-PV, irrespective of immune status. There was a significant association between presence of beta-PV and lesions from sun-exposed skin sites in the RTRs (P = 0.002). We conclude that in skin carcinogenesis, relations between the herein studied tumour suppressors and HPV are different from what one would expect based on findings in cervical neoplasia.

By holding human fibroblast cultures confluent for up to 12 weeks at a time, we confirmed previous observations and showed that telomeric attrition requires cell division and also, that senescence occurs at a constant average telomere length, not at a constant time point. However, on resuming cell division, these long-term confluent (LTC) cultures completed 15-25 fewer mean population doublings (MPDs) than the controls prior to senescence. These lost divisions were mainly accounted for by slow cell turnover of the LTC cultures and by permanent cell cycle exit of 94% of the LTC cells, which resulted in many cell divisions being unmeasured by the MPD method. In the LTC cultures, p27(KIP1) accumulated and pRb became under-phosphorylated and under-expressed. Also, coincident with permanent cell cycle exit and before 1 MPD was completed, the LTC cultures upregulated the cell cycle inhibitors p21(WAF) and p16(INK4A) but not p14(ARF) and developed other markers of senescence. We then tested the relationship between cell cycle re-entry and the cell cycle-inhibitory proteins following subculture of the LTC cultures. In these cultures, the downregulation of p27(KIP1) and the phosphorylation of pRb preceded the complete resumption of normal proliferation rate, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of p16(INK4A). Our results show that most normal human fibroblasts can accumulate p16(INK4A), p21(WAF) and p27(KIP1) and senesce by cell division-independent mechanism(s). Furthermore, this form of senescence likely requires p16(INK4A) and perhaps p27(KIP1).",

        "Doc_abstract":"The ARF tumor suppressor protein stabilizes p53 by antagonizing its negative regulator, Mdm2 (Hdm2 in humans). Both mouse p19(ARF) and human p14(ARF) bind to the central region of Mdm2 (residues 210 to 304), a segment that does not overlap with its N-terminal p53-binding domain, nuclear import or export signals, or C-terminal RING domain required for Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The N-terminal 37 amino acids of mouse p19(ARF) are necessary and sufficient for binding to Mdm2, localization of Mdm2 to nucleoli, and p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Although a nucleolar localization signal (NrLS) maps within a different segment (residues 82 to 101) of the human p14(ARF) protein, binding to Mdm2 and nucleolar import of ARF-Mdm2 complexes are both required for cell cycle arrest induced by either the mouse or human ARF proteins. Because many codons of mouse ARF mRNA are not recognized by the most abundant bacterial tRNAs, we synthesized ARF minigenes containing preferred bacterial codons. Using bacterially produced ARF polypeptides and chemically synthesized peptides conjugated to Sepharose, residues 1 to 14 and 26 to 37 of mouse p19(ARF) were found to interact independently and cooperatively with Mdm2, while residues 15 to 25 were dispensable for binding. Paradoxically, residues 26 to 37 of mouse p19(ARF) are also essential for ARF nucleolar localization in the absence of Mdm2. However, the mobilization of the p19(ARF)-Mdm2 complex into nucleoli also requires a cryptic NrLS within the Mdm2 C-terminal RING domain. The Mdm2 NrLS is unmasked upon ARF binding, and its deletion prevents import of the ARF-Mdm2 complex into nucleoli. Collectively, the results suggest that ARF binding to Mdm2 induces a conformational change that facilitates nucleolar import of the ARF-Mdm2 complex and p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Hence, the ARF-Mdm2 interaction can be viewed as bidirectional, with each protein being capable of regulating the subnuclear localization of the other.",

Recently, it has been found that silencing of p16INK4a and p14ARF expressions by aberrant methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter regions is an alternative mechanism that inactivates possible tumor suppressor functions in various tumors. To clarify the features of gastric cancers with promoter methylation of p16INK4a and p14ARF, we investigated the methylation status in gastric cancer cell lines and primary gastric cancers using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and correlated the methylation status with microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA ploidy pattern, p53 immunohistochemistry, and various clinicopathologic factors, paying attention to the correlations with the histologic types. Of 10 cell lines studied, silencing of the expression of p16INK4a and p14ARF due to promoter methylation was detected by MSP and RT-PCR in six (60%) and two (20%) cell lines, respectively. p14ARF silencing was detected only in cell lines derived from gastric cancer of the diffuse type, while p16INK4a silencing was found in cell lines derived from both diffuse and intestinal types. In 59 primary gastric cancers, promoter methylation of p16INK4a and p14ARF was found in 10 (17%) and 14 (24%) of the tumors independently, there being an association with DNA diploidy, but not with p53 immunohistochemistry. p16INK4a methylation was found irrespective of tumor stages and histology. Whereas p14ARF methylation was found more frequently in intestinal type cancers in an early stage and in diffuse type cancers in an advanced stage, MSI tended to be related especially to p14ARF methylation in cancers of the intestinal type. Thus, the significance of p14ARF methylation differed between intestinal and diffuse types, while such a difference was not observed in p16INK4a methylation.",

The colposcopic impression and cervical biopsy diagnosis served as the standards for correlation with cytological, p16(INK4a), and HPV data. p16(INK4a) was evaluated using an immunoperoxidase-based assay that was linear over 4 logs for the detection of HeLa-spiked positive control cytology specimens, using a threshold for positive test results that was based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. HR-HPV was detected by multiplex PCR using genotype-specific primers.;: In all combined diagnostic categories (negative for intraepithelial lesion and malignancy, atypical glandular cells, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), the p16(INK4a) ICC and HR-HPV assays, respectively, had sensitivity of 81.7% and 83.3% (P = .81) and specificity of 78.1% and 50.9% (P < .001) for the detection of underlying > or =grade 2 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions on biopsy.

The p14ARF transcript, which is an alternative spliced form of this locus, is also altered or deleted in a proportion of human lung cancers and has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression as an endogenous cellular regulator of the p53 protein, raising the possibility that it might constitute an additional lung tumor suppressor gene at the 9p21 locus. To test the candidacy of p14ARF as a lung cancer suppressor and assess the role it plays in radiosensitivity, we transfected the wild-type p14ARF gene into four cell lines which had various endogenous gene backgrounds of INK4A-/p53+/RB+ (A549 and H460), INK4A+/p53+/RB- (H446) as well as p14ARF+/p53-/RB+ (Calu-1). We found that transfection of p14ARF is related to an obvious growth inhibition in all wtp53 cell lines, regardless of INK4A/ARF and RB status. Although it has been shown that p53-induced G1 checkpoint in response to DNA damage by ionizing radiation is p14ARF-independent, we found the radiosensitivity of two p14ARF-deficient cell lines was increased after p14ARF gene transfer. The results indicated that cell cycle redistribution after acquiring the exogenous gene might be the main explanation for the enhanced sensitization. An increased radiation-induced apoptotic proportion in one cell line also suggested a fortified p53 function that might be triggered by the restored p14ARF protein.",

An improved understanding of the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the radio- and chemosensitivity of gliomas may help to identify glioma patients who will benefit from aggressive and, therefore, potentially toxic adjuvant treatment. It may also allow for the development of new therapies aimed at improving the response of these tumors towards chemo- and radiotherapy. The INK4a gene products, p16 and p14ARF, have been suggested as potential regulators of glioma chemo- and radiosensitivity. We have used tetracycline controlled expression of p16 and plasmid-based p14ARF expression to study the chemo- and radiosensitivity of glioma cell lines. Ectopic p16 sensitized U-87MG cells towards treatment with vincristine and possibly also BCNU by approximately 1.5 to 2-fold, and towards ionizing radiation by a factor of 1.5. p14ARF expression was found to render U-87MG cells 2-fold more radioresistant than controls. These findings support a role for p16 and p14ARF as modulators of the radio-and chemosensitivity of gliomas. Further studies of the role of cell cycle regulators in glioma chemo- and radio-sensitivity seem warranted. We would like to point out that such candidate genes which may code for potent growth suppressors (like p16) or even toxic gene products can be successfully investigated using the approach detailed in this manuscript.",

In vitro, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha have been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis induced by H. pylori. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in many cancers, including gastric cancer. Since p53 protein can induce apoptosis, we sought to determine whether or not p53 increases the ability of gastric epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis in response to H. pylori-induced cell injury. Human gastric epithelial cell lines, AGS (p53 wild-type) cells and AGS cells infected with HPV E6 gene (AGS-E6) to inactivate p53 were exposed to H. pylori. The p53, p21, and p14ARF proteins were measured in gastric epithelial cells by immunoelectrophoresis. Gastric epithelial cell apoptosis was measured by DNA end-labeling assay (TUNEL) and subG0 cell fractions using flow cytometry, and by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA. Exposure to H. pylori increased the levels of p53, p21, and p14ARF proteins two fold in AGS cells. Gastric AGS cells with fragmented DNA increased from 1.1% to 68% in after exposure to H. pylori for 24 hr. However, AGS-E6 cells were relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by H. pylori (only 15% of cells underwent apoptosis). In additional experiments, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were used to further investigate the role of ARF in stabilizing p53 after exposure to H. pylori. Wild-type and p19ARF-/- MEFs were exposed to H. pylori and evaluated for activation of p53, p19ARF, and apoptosis. As with AGS cells, H. pylori stimulated a 2-fold increase in p53 and p19ARF in wild-type MEFs; however, there was no increase in p53 in ARF-null MEFs. H. pylori easily stimulated apoptosis in wild-type MEFs, although, the absence of p19ARF significantly reduced the ability of H. pylori to induce apoptosis in these cells. Activation of ARF by H. pylori is important in stabilizing p53 resulting in increased apoptosis. Thus, inactivation of either ARF or p53 in gastric cells may reduce their ability to undergo apoptosis in response to injury induced by H. pylori.",

To determine the frequency of co-deletion of these two genes, we investigated 50 samples of primary NSCLC using a quantitative PCR-ELISA. All specimens were fixed in formalin, paraffin embedded and stored until assayed. Histologic subtypes included 25 adenocarcinomas (50%), 21 squamous cell carcinomas (42%) and four large cell carcinomas (8%). Homozygous deletions of MTAP exon 8 could be detected in 19 of 50 NSCLC samples (38%). Adenocarcinoma (11 of 25, 44%) showed a higher deletion frequency than squamous cell carcinoma (six of 21, 29%). In contrast, homozygous p16INK4A deletions were detected in only nine of 50 (18%) samples using specific primers for p16INK4A exon 1alpha. No difference between the histological subtypes and p16INK4A deletion frequency was observed. We further investigated the ten samples with MTAP deletions but intact p16INK4A exon 1alpha with primers specific for p16INK4A exon 3, the exon nearest to MTAP exon 8. Interestingly, none of the ten samples had deletion of the p16INK4A exon 3 coding region. Fine mapping analysis performed in ten samples showed a frequent breakpoint between MTAP exon 4 and exon 5. In addition, p16 protein expression could not be detected in five out of six samples with intact p16 but deleted MTAP locus. These data show a high frequency of homozygous MTAP deletions in NSCLC which is associated with detectable co-deletion of p16INK4A in only half of the cases. This result suggests the existence either of another tumor suppressor gene telomeric of p16INK4A or of deletions involving 3'-untranslated (3'-UTR) regulatory regions of p16INK4A that can interfere with its expression or function.",

It is only rarely associated with Muir-Torre syndrome. Previous studies from Asian countries, have suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection plays a role in the pathogenesis and overexpression of p16(INK4a), a surrogate marker of HPV infection, have also been reported. However, data from western countries seem contradictory. In order to clarify and explore the molecular and epigenetic basis of HPV, CDKN2A status and role of microsatellite instability in the development of periocular sebaceous carcinoma, 24 cases of periocular sebaceous carcinoma were analyzed for the expression of p16(INK4a) and mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) via immunohistochemistry. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genechip HPV typing were used to detect HPV infection and decide its genotype when present. PCR amplification using a consensus primer pair was also performed to detect β-HPV. The methylation status of CDKN2A promoter region was studied by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. HPV-positivity was demonstrated in only one of our cases (HPV 16), while another case showed p16(INK4a) overexpression. All cases showed preserved expression of mismatch repair proteins. CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation was noted in nearly half of our cases (11/24) and was associated with younger patient age (P = .013). Our results showed that periocular sebaceous carcinoma is rarely associated with HPV and microsatellite instability. Higher frequency of CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation in younger patients implies a significant epigenetic role in tumor development in this age group. ",

The encoded protein, p16(INK4A), comprises four ankyrin-type repeats, and the mutations, most of which are missense and occur throughout the entire coding region, can disrupt the conformation of these structural motifs as well as the association of p16(INK4a) with its physiological targets, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) CDK4 and CDK6. Assessing pathogenicity of nonsynonymous mutations is critical to evaluate melanoma risk in carriers. In the current study, we investigate 20 CDKN2A germline mutations whose effects on p16(INK4A) structure and function have not been previously documented (Thr18_Ala19dup, Gly23Asp, Arg24Gln, Gly35Ala, Gly35Val, Ala57Val, Ala60Val, Ala60Arg, Leu65dup, Gly67Arg, Gly67_Asn71del, Glu69Gly, Asp74Tyr, Thr77Pro, Arg80Pro, Pro81Thr, Arg87Trp, Leu97Arg, Arg99Pro, and [Leu113Leu;Pro114Ser]). By considering genetic information, the predicted impact of each variant on the protein structure, its ability to interact with CDK4 and impede cell proliferation in experimental settings, we conclude that 18 of the 20 CDKN2A variants can be classed as loss of function mutations, whereas the results for two remain ambiguous. Discriminating between mutant and neutral variants of p16(INK4A) not only adds to our understanding of the functionally critical residues in the protein but provides information that can be used for melanoma risk prediction.",

In addition, expression of p15(INK4b) and RB1 was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. From selected patients, we analyzed the methylation pattern of cell cycle control genes in CD34+ bone marrow cells. Thirty-nine of 49 cases (80%) had at least one of five genes methylated in our MDS samples by analysing low-density non-adherent bone marrow cells. The frequency of p15(INK4b) methylation was 34 of 49 samples (69%). The incidence of methylation of both p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) was four of 49 (8%). RB1 gene was methylated in seven samples (14%) and each patient had RA. Interestingly, none of these genes were methylated in the purified CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from the MDS patients. Furthermore, all our RARS patients had a methylated p15(INK4b) promoter correlating with non-detectable expression of this gene in bone marrow cells from those patients.

We determined tumor HPV16 status and expression of p14/p53 and genotyped p14 (ARF) -rs3731217 and -rs3088440 polymorphisms in 552 incident SCCOP patients. We found that patients having variant genotypes for each p14 (ARF) polymorphism were approximately two or three times as likely to have HPV16-positive tumors compared with patients with corresponding common homozygous genotype, and such an association was particularly pronounced in patients with variant genotypes of both polymorphisms. After definitive chemoradiotherapy, patients having p14 (ARF) rs3731217 TG/GG variant genotypes had significantly better overall, disease-specific and disease-free survival than those having TT genotype, respectively.

Furthermore, such significantly prognostic effect was also found when survival analysis was limited to HPV16-positive patients.

The aims of this study were to detect the expression of HPV L1 capsid protein and p16(INK4a) in cervical lesions and to investigate the combination expression of HPV L1 capsid protein and p16(INK4a) in cervical lesions and its diagnostic efficiency in clinic. Immunochemical method was used to detect the expression of HPV L1 capsid protein and p16(INK4a) in 169 cases of abnormal cytology. Histopathologic test was performed to identify cervical lesions of all the cases. chi(2) test and spearman's rank correlation were used for statistical analysis. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), accuracy, and the area under the receive operating characteristic (ROC) curve (denoted by A(Z)) were calculated with SPSS 13.0. All the statistical tests were two sided at the 5% level of significance. L1 expression decreased (P < 0.001), but p16(INK4a) expression increased (P < 0.001) with histopathologic diagnosis increasing. The expression rates of HPV L1 capsid protein, p16(INK4a), and L1(-)/p16(+) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2, CIN3, and squamous-cell carcinoma were statistically different from those in CIN1 (P < 0.001). The expressions of HPV L1 capsid protein, L1(+)/p16(+), L1(+)/p16(-), and L1(-)/p16(-) were negatively correlated with the severity of cervical lesions (P < 0.001), whereas the expressions of p16(INK4a) and L1(-)/p16(+) were positively correlated with the severity of cervical lesions (P < 0.001). The specificity and A(Z) of combining L1 with p16 (INK4a) were statistically higher than L1 or p16 (INK4a) alone (P < 0.05).

Using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, high-stage muscle invasive TCC expressed the Rb, p16 and CDK4 mRNA at lower levels than low-stage superficial cancers, indicating down-regulation to be linked with tumor progression. The drop of the expression in the group of grade 2 TCC when invading the muscle layer compared to grade 2 carcinomas with a superficial pattern of growth is considered to represent a key event in promoting urothelial carcinogenesis in this subset of carcinomas. The protein expression of the Rb gene evaluated by immunohistochemistry proved to be closely related to the tumor grades and stages as well as to the mRNA expression, high-grade and high-stage TCC disclosing a lower rate of positive immunoreactivity than low-grade and low-stage carcinomas. The p16 protein product was expressed at a lower level in grade 3 than in grade 1 TCC, but there was no correlation with the tumor stages or the mRNA expression. TCC with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the INK4A region showed a decreased expression of p16 mRNA compared to those without an allelic loss. Tobacco smoke was not identified to substantially modulate the Rb/p16/CDK4 pathways, except for a ten-fold elevated mRNA expression of the p16 gene in TCC of light compared to heavy smokers. Heavy coffee consumption was associated with a reduced expression of CDK4 mRNA. Among occupational exposures, TCC of patients in contact with stone dust, paints and lacquer, plastics, wood and wood preservers and chemical solvents and adhesives displayed altered partly elevated, partly reduced levels of Rb, p16 and CDK4 mRNA compared to non-exposed subjects.

To investigate this heterogeneity, we analysed 307 HNSCC cases (tonsillar, n=135; non-tonsillar, n=172) from eight health care centers mostly from Northern Germany and determined HPV-DNA/mRNA and p16INK4A-status and combined results with the patient outcome. Overall HPV-DNA prevalence rate was 23.5% (72/307); attributed to: 43.7% (59/135) and 7.6% (13/172) tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases, respectively. Among these, 96.6% tonsillar and 38.5% non-tonsillar SCC were HPV-mRNA-positive. Although the study cohort was composed of patients from regions of rather close proximity, prevalence rates showed diversities of up to 40% in HNSCC subsite analysis with the lowest prevalence for tonsillar SCC in metropolitan areas (22.2%) vs. 50.9% in rural areas. Survival analysis identified p16INK4A alone as strongest predictor, followed by HPV-DNA-status alone or in combination with p16INK4A. This survival benefit was shown for tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases. Smoking significantly correlated with HPV-status, however, it does not influence survival when stratified for HPV. In conclusion, the data emphasize the urge for further data on HPV-infection in HNSCC to, e.g. clarify to what extent survival benefits of p16INK4A-positive patients are truly attributed to HPV-infections.

Recent studies have indicated that mouse p19ARF negatively regulates Myc's transcriptional activity. We here show that the human p14ARF directly associates with Myc and relocates Myc from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus. We found that p14ARF interacts with the Myc-Max complex and the binding of p14ARF does not interfere with Myc-Max interaction in vitro. Protein interaction assays define the Myc BoxII as a critical domain required for interaction with p14ARF. Moreover, we identify 30 amino acids encompassing Myc BoxII domain required for p14ARF interaction and colocalization in vivo. Finally, we show that p14ARF down regulates Myc activated transcription and that this activity cannot be addressed to an intrinsic p14ARF repressor domain.",

Aging-associated senescence results in reduced number and function of EPCs, potentially contributing to increased cardiac risk, reduced angiogenic capacity, and impaired cardiac repair effectiveness. The mechanisms underlying EPC senescence are unknown. Increasing evidence supports the role of microRNAs in regulating cellular senescence.;We aimed to determine whether microRNAs regulated EPC senescence and, if so, what the underlying mechanisms are.;To map the microRNA/gene expression signatures of EPC senescence, we performed microRNA profiling and microarray analysis in lineage-negative bone marrow cells from young and aged wild-type and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. We identified 2 microRNAs, microRNA-10A* (miR-10A*), and miR-21, and their common target gene Hmga2 as critical regulators for EPC senescence. Overexpression of miR-10A* and miR-21 in young EPCs suppressed Hmga2 expression, caused EPC senescence, as evidenced by senescence-associated β-galactosidase upregulation, decreased self-renewal potential, increased p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) expression, and resulted in impaired EPC angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, resembling EPCs derived from aged mice. In contrast, suppression of miR-10A* and miR-21 in aged EPCs increased Hmga2 expression, rejuvenated EPCs, resulting in decreased senescence-associated β-galactosidase expression, increased self-renewal potential, decreased p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) expression, and improved EPC angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

A role for p16(INK4a) in basal cell carcinoma is suggested by the observation that p16(INK4a) was upregulated at the invasive front of the majority of basal cell carcinomas with infiltrative growth patterns, accompanied by cessation of proliferation. In this paper, we explore whether there is a difference of tumour cells' proliferative activity between the centre and the invasion front tissues of human colorectal cancer and its relationship with the expression and methylation status of p16(INK4a) gene. We obtained the centre and the invasion front tissues of colorectal cancer respectively by the technology of laser mircodissection. The expressions of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ki67 and p16(INK4a) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the different areas. There was a significant difference in the expressions of ki67 between the centre and the invasion front tissues (p < 0.05). The difference did not correlate with age, sex, Dukes stage but did correlate with expression of p16(INK4a) gene (chi(2) = 25.37, p < 0.01). Furthermore, hypermethylation of the promoter was the major mechanism of inactivation of p16(INK4a) in the centre areas. Demethylation of the p16(INK4a) promoter, the elevated expression of p16(INK4a) protein and mRNA level was proved in the invasion front. Our finding suggested that enhanced invasion in tumours was accompanied by ceased proliferation in the invasion fronts of human colorectal cancer. This interesting phenomenon may be due to not only the microenvironment, but also the molecular changes such as p16(INK4a) status.",

Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) by CDK4/6 represents a vital step in cell cycle progression. Alterations of p16INK4A are frequent events in human malignancies. In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) the data concerning the mechanisms of p16INK4A inactivation suggest that point mutations and aberrant methylation of its promoter can only account for a proportion of the cases with abnormal p16 immunoexpression. The role of deletions in this procedure is not yet clarified. In order to gain more insight into the role of deletions in p16INK4A deregulated expression, we investigated the state of the chromosomal region 9p21-22 in a series of 57 NSCLCs, by performing a detailed mapping analysis, using a tight cluster of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, and correlating the findings with p16 immunostaining. Abnormal p16 expression was observed in 46% of the NSCLCs examined. No relationship was observed between p16 abnormal staining and various clinicopathological parameters. Abnormal p16 protein staining was strongly associated with hemizygous deletions at the IFNA and D9S171 microsatellite loci, which demarcate the region encoding the p16INK4A gene (P = 0.002). These findings suggest that deregulated expression of p16 is involved in the multistage process of NSCL carcinogenesis and that deletions may represent a predominant mechanism of p16INK4A inactivation. A significant percentage also of LOH was noticed at the D9S162 (35%) and D9S126 (38%) loci which lie 6cM and 4cM, respectively, far from the area which encodes p16INK4A, implying that other tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) may reside in this region. Although the overall incidence of LOH at the examined region was high (58%), we did not observe any correlation with smoking habits, histology and lymph node status. Another noteworthy finding was the existence of microsatellite instability (MI) in 11% of the patients. MI provides a marker for replication error phenotype (RER+), a recently defined manifestation of genetic instability observed in a wide range of tumors. In conclusion, alterations (LOH + MI) at the 9p21-22 chromosome region are frequent events in NSCLCs and may affect directly or indirectly the expression of p16.",

The prognostic significance of these molecular events at different sites within the head and neck, however, remains controversial. Thus, we sought to determine the relationship between cyclin D1 and/or p16INK4A expression and disease outcome in squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue. Immunohistochemical detection of nuclear proteins cyclin D1, p53, and p16INK4A, and the Ki-67 labeling index was undertaken in tissue sections from 148 tongue cancers treated by surgical resection. Nuclear antigen status was analyzed in relation to pathological variables, tumor recurrence, and patient survival. Statistical significance was assessed using chi2 analysis for pathological variables and the Kaplan-Meier method, log rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards model for survival parameters. Overexpression of cyclin D1 occurred in 68% of tumors (100 of 147) and was associated with increased lymph node stage (P = 0.014), increased tumor grade (P = 0.003), and reduced disease-free (P = 0.006) and overall (P = 0.01) survival. Loss of p16INK4A expression was demonstrated in 55% of tumors (78 of 143) and was associated with reduced disease-free (P = 0.007) and overall (P = 0.014) survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that in addition to pathological stage and regional lymph node status, cyclin D1 overexpression and loss of p16INK4A expression are independent predictors of death from tongue cancer. Loss of p16INK4A in the presence of cyclin D1 overexpression conferred a significantly worse disease-free (P = 0.011) and overall (P = 0.002) survival at 5 years. p53 nuclear accumulation and the Ki-67 labeling index were not prognostic. These data indicate that cyclin D1 overexpression and loss of p16INK4A expression predict early relapse and reduced survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue. Simultaneous assessment of cyclin D1 and p16INK4A protein levels define subgroups of patients at increased risk of relapse and may be of clinical utility in optimizing therapy.",

Mutations, loss of heterozygosity and deletions of the CDKN2 locus have been reported in sporadic and familial cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM). To investigate the role of the alterations of p16 expression in melanoma, we evaluated by immunohistochemistry the p16 expression and cell proliferation in 79 primary CMM and 10 benign melanocytic nevi (BMN). Forty-six melanomas (58%) and all BMN were found to be p16 positive; 33 melanomas (42%) were considered p16 negative. The extent of invasion according to Clark was significantly higher in p16-negative tumors than in p16-positive tumors. Cell proliferation as expressed by the proportion of positive cells in Ki-67 immunostaining was found to be significantly higher in p16-negative tumors than in p16-positive tumors, although there was no significant difference in the mitotic index between p16-positive and p16-negative tumors. In p16-positive tumors, the number of Ki-67-positive cells correlated with the mitotic index; in p16-negative tumors, there was no correlation between these parameters.

Northern analysis indicated that p16(INK4a) messenger RNA coordinately increased in a dose-dependent manner more than 2-fold in irradiated cells at the tested doses.;UVB irradiation transcriptionally activates the expression of p16(INK4a) in cultured human melanocytes. Therefore the growth arrest that occurs with irradiation of melanocytes could be mediated, in part, by upregulation of p16(INK4a). This transient arrest may allow repair of UVB-induced DNA damage before cell division.

We analyzed the status of the Rb, p53, p15INK4B, p16INK4A and p14ARF genes in these diseases by Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and western blot analysis. We used 31 NK cell neoplasms, including four cell lines derived from NK cell neoplasms, 3 myeloid / NK cell precursor acute leukemias, 4 blastic NK cell lymphoma / leukemias, 4 aggressive NK cell leukemia / lymphomas, 4 nasal NK cell lymphomas, and 12 chronic NK lymphocytosis. We found gene amplification of the p53 gene in one nasal NK cell lymphoma, and point mutations of the p53 gene in one blastic NK cell lymphoma / leukemia and one chronic NK lymphocytosis. In addition, homozygous deletions of p15, p16 and p14 genes in 5 out of 31 samples were detected; 3 were from nasal NK cell lymphoma and 2 from blastic NK cell lymphoma / leukemia. Also hemizygous deletion of the Rb gene in one blastic NK cell lymphoma was detected. Rb proteins were highly expressed in one cell line as well as two myeloid / NK cell precursor acute leukemias. In other cell lines, complete loss and an aberrant migration pattern of Rb protein expression were observed. Comparative genomic hybridization suggested that the homozygous deletions of the p15, p16 and p14 were subtle chromosomal deletions and could not be identified by standard karyotyping in some cases. Although the number of cases we analyzed was not large, alterations identified in the Rb, p53, p16, p15 and p14 genes are of significance and might be associated with tumorigenesis in NK cell neoplasms.",

Overexpression of p16(INK4a), a surrogate marker for infection with oncogenic HPV in other tumours, has been described for urothelial carcinoma in situ (UCIS). Our goal was therefore to evaluate whether overexpression of p16(INK4a) is associated with HPV infection and to identify mechanisms of p16(INK4a) upregulation in UCIS.;In 60 tissue specimens from a total of 45 patients (UCIS and controls), we performed p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry followed by detection and subclassification of HPV DNA. In a subset of samples, we tested for gene amplification of p16(INK4a) applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RAS/MAPK signalling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Finally, we transfected urothelial carcinoma cells with KRAS and examined the expression of p16(INK4a) as well as markers of EMT.;We found overexpression of p16(INK4a) in 92.6% of UCIS and in all cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) controls. In contrast, we detected high-risk HPV DNA in 80% of CIN, but none in UCIS. There was no gene amplification of p16(INK4a). High levels of phosphorylated kinases and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and loss of membraneous E-cadherin were detected in UCIS. KRAS transfection of urothelial carcinoma cells led to upregulation of p16(INK4a) and uPA accompanied by loss of E-cadherin that could be inhibited by application of the kinase-inhibitor Sorafenib.;Our results show that overexpression of p16(INK4a) in UCIS is neither associated with HPV infection nor p16(INK4a) gene amplification but is a consequence of enhanced RAS/MAPK signalling that promotes EMT, possibly due to Sorafenib-sensitive paracrine secretion of the EMT activator uPA. These findings might open a novel therapeutic option for localized but aggressive urothelial cancer.",

Nineteen HGNECs of the head and neck (1 oropharyngeal, 5 sinonasal, 7 of the larynx, and 6 of the parotid gland) were reviewed and analyzed with a immunohistochemical panel, with special emphasis on cell cycle proteins. The tumors were tested for HPV by in situ hybridization (GenPoint HPV, Dako) and PCR (SPF10-DEIA-LiPA25). Merkel cell polyomavirus was studied using the antibody CM2B4. Fifteen HGNEC were of small cell and 4 of large cell type. Most of the tumors (14/19, 73.7 %), including all the pure small cell carcinomas, showed a strong and diffuse positive staining for p16. Eleven of them (78.5 %) had Rb loss and a low or absent cyclin D1 expression. All cases were negative for HPV and polyomavirus. Most patients were smokers, diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, and had a poor outcome, with a 5-year survival of 18 %. In conclusion, HGNECs of the head and neck are infrequently related to HPV infection, but usually show strong, diffuse positive p16 immunostaining due to Rb pathway dysregulation. Awareness of this immunohistochemical pattern of expression may avoid a potential diagnostic pitfall with HPV-associated non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas, which have a better prognosis. ",

The effects of ectopic over-expression of p15(INK4B) in cell lines with and without wild type Rb were examined by measuring cell recovery. Proliferation was inhibited in cells lacking Rb as well as in cells with wild type Rb expression. Experiments analyzing the effectiveness of chimeric p15(INK4B)/p16(INK4A) proteins indicated that the Rb independent growth inhibition required N-terminal residues of p15(INK4B). Linker insertion mutation of p15(INK4B) showed that the inhibition was dependent on intact ankyrin structures.

Alterations of its product have been observed in various malignancies, including non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We earlier investigated the mechanisms underlying p16(INK4A) inactivation. In the present study, we examined, in a series of 87 NSCLCs, its relationship with the kinetic parameters [proliferation index (PI) and apoptotic index (Al)] and the ploidy status of the tumors. In addition, we extended our previous LOH analysis of the 9p21-23 region by examining flanking areas of p16(INK4A). Aberrant p16 expression was observed in 41.4% of the carcinomas. A significant association was found with increased PI (p = 0.037), but not with apoptosis. Aneuploid tumors were more frequently correlated with abnormal p16 staining (p = 0. 05). A high frequency of allelic imbalance (Alm) was noticed at the D9S161 (51.3%) and D9S157 (64.5%) loci, which lie approximately 4cM centromeric and 7cM telomeric, respectively, to CDKN2A. Abnormal p16(INK4A) expression was strongly correlated with Alm at D9S161 (p = 0.004). Allelic losses at D9S157 occurred more frequently in early stages (p = 0.018) and were significantly associated with deletions at D9S161 (p = 0.035). We conclude that, in a sub-set of NSCLCs, (i) abnormal p16 expression contributes to tumor growth mainly by increasing the proliferative activity in the initial stages of carcinogenesis; (ii) the association with aneuploidy merely reflects the impact of aberrant p16 on proliferative activity; and (iii) other putative TSGs possibly reside within the 9p21-23 region that possibly co-operate in certain cases with CDKN2A in the development of NSCLCs.",

The levels of p14(ARF) and EGFR expressed in Hep-2 cells and xenografts were determined by western blot assay.;Ad-p14(ARF) combining with Ad-antisense EGFR markedly inhibited the Hep-2 proliferation compared with alone (P=0.001, P=0.002 respectively). Combination of Ad-p14(ARF) and Ad-antisense EGFR led to the proportion of Hep-2 cells in G0/G1 phases increased by up to 86.9%. The down-expression of EGFR protein and overexpression of p14(ARF) protein were observed in vitro and in vivo, and this effect was preserved when Ad-p14(ARF) was combined with Ad-antisense EGFR. Besides, Ad-p14(ARF) plus Ad-antisense EGFR significantly (P<0.05) increased the antitumor activity against Hep-2 tumor xenografts comparing with Ad-p14(ARF) or Ad-antisense EGFR alone.;Combination Ad-p14(ARF) with Ad-antisense EGFR significantly increased the antitumor responses in LSCC. An effectively potential gene therapy to prevent proliferation of LSCC was provided.",

Current noninvasive tests such as cytology lack sufficient sensitivity to detect low-grade, low-stage tumors. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes, such as p16(INK4a), VHL, and the mismatch repair gene hMLH1, has established promoter hypermethylation as a common mechanism for tumor suppressor inactivation in human cancers. It is also a promising new target for molecular detection in bodily fluids including urine, a readily accessible fluid known to contain bladder cancer cells. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) can determine the presence or absence of methylation of a gene locus at a sensitivity level of up to 1 methylated allele in 1000 unmethylated alleles, appropriate for identifying cancer cell DNA in a bodily fluid.;We first determined the frequency of hypermethylation of the Rb tumor suppressor gene by bisulfite sequencing and of the p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), APC, and RASSF1A tumor suppressor genes by MSP in 45 bladder cancers. We then designed a panel optimal for diagnostic coverage composed of the APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF) tumor suppressor genes. This panel was tested for detection of hypermethylation in matched sediment DNA from urine specimens obtained before surgery from the same 45 bladder cancer patients (2 Tis, 16 Ta, 10 T1, and 17 T2-4) as well as normal and benign control DNAs.;Hypermethylation of at least one of three suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF)) was found in all 45 tumor DNAs (100% diagnostic coverage). We detected gene hypermethylation in the matched urine DNA from 39 of 45 patients (87% sensitivity), including 16 cases that had negative cytology. No hypermethylation of APC, RASSF1A, or p14(ARF) was observed in normal transitional cell DNAs or in urine DNAs from normal healthy individuals and patients with inflammatory urinary disease (cystitis). Furthermore, an unmethylated gene in the tumor DNA was always found to be unmethylated in the matched urine DNA (100% specificity).;Promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is common in bladder cancer and was found in all grades and stages of tumors examined. Hypermethylation was detected in the urine DNA from 39 of 45 (87%) patients, including cases of early-stage disease amenable to cure.

The etiology of primary endometrial squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), however, is speculative. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of p14, p16, p53, cyclin D1, steroid hormone receptors, and human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection in the pathogenesis of primary endometrial squamous cell carcinoma. The expression of p16, p14, p53, cyclin D1, and steroid hormone receptors (estrogen, progesterone, and androgen) was examined immunohistochemically in 8 primary ESCCs. HPV analysis was performed using general primers and HPV typing. The median age of the patients was 62.1 years. Four cases showed positive nuclear and cytoplasmic p16 staining in an insular pattern, and 1 case nuclear positivity for p53 and estrogen receptors, respectively. Four of 8 cases were positive for progesterone receptor analysis and cyclin D1. All cases were negative for p14 and androgen receptor staining. All but one case were negative for HPV analysis. Five patients were alive with and without evidence of disease after a mean follow-up of 6.1 years. The results of this study suggest that alterations of the p16 pathway may play an etiologic role in at least a proportion of the ESCC, but without any association to HPV infection.

Expression profiles of cytokeratins, 5/6; 8/18; 10; 13; 14; and 19, p16, and pRb were evaluated in 101 consecutive patients with cervical nodal metastasis who had undergone neck dissection to treat known head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (primary sites: 16, oral cavity; 38, oropharynx; 26, hypopharynx; 21, larynx). Cytokeratin 10 was more frequently expressed in oral cavity primary tumors, whereas cytokeratin 19 staining was more frequently observed in tumors originated from the pharynx and larynx. The expression of p16 and altered pRb status (0% or >50%) were more frequently observed in oropharynx primary tumors. To select the best subset among the 8 antibodies tested, classification and regression tree analysis was performed. The analysis correctly classified the four primary sites (25.0% of oral cavity, 89.5% of oropharynx, 30.8% of hypopharynx, and 57.1% of larynx) using 5 variables (histologic subtype, p16, cytokeratins 10 and 19, and pRb).

Tobacco use and heavy alcohol consumption are known risk factors for HNSCC but in other cases human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked to carcinogenesis. HPV proteins E6 and E7 promote oncogenesis by blocking the action of p53 and pRB, respectively. An absence of p53 mutations in addition to expression of p16 are part of the distinct molecular profile identified in the subset of HNSCCs because of HPV. Various methods are available for HPV detection but polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization techniques are commonly used. Both methods are amenable for testing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue that is a sample type readily available to the pathologist. HPV is detectable in approximately a quarter of all HNSCCs, and is particularly prevalent in the oropharynx in which the positivity rates approach 40%. A vast majority of HPV-related HNSCCs are owing to HPV type 16 with types 18, 31, and 33 accounting for almost all of the remaining cases. HPV-related HNSCCs are associated with better prognosis for both recurrence and survival. This group of tumors has also been shown to respond well to radiation treatment. As the clinical relevance of HPV in HNSCCs continues to emerge, anatomic pathologists are likely to receive increasing requests for testing.

A variety of factors have been reported to play a role in this latter process. We report here that p14(ARF) displays different effects on the anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of p53-null/Mdm2 wild type cells. p14(ARF) blocks both the anchorage-dependent and-independent (soft agar) proliferation of 293T and p53(-/-) HCT116, but not p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells. While p14(ARF) had no effect on the anchorage-dependent proliferation of p53(-/-) MEFs and Ras12V-transformed p53(-/-) MEFs, it inhibited the growth of Ras12V-transformed p53(-/-) MEFs in soft agar. Furthermore, ectopic expression of p14(ARF) did not lead to degradation of the E2F1 protein and did not result in the reduction of E2F1 activity detected by two E2F1 responsible promoters, Apaf1 and p14(ARF) promoter, in 293T, p53(-/-) HCT116, and H1299 cells. This is consistent with our observations that p14(ARF) did not result in G1 arrest, but induced apoptosis via Bax up-regulation.

Promoter hypermethylation of the p14ARF gene was detected in 6/29 (21%) oligodendrogliomas and 3/20 (15%) anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. None of the oligodendrogliomas and only 1 out of 20 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas showed hypermethylation of p16INK4a. Homozygous deletion was not detected in any of the WHO grade II oligodendrogliomas but was present in 5/20 (25%) anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and always affected both genes. In one tumor containing distinct areas with and without anaplasia, p14ARF hypermethylation was detected in the WHO grade II area, while homozygous co-deletion of p14ARF and p16INK4a was found in the region with anaplastic features (grade III). These data suggest that aberrant p14ARF expression due to hypermethylation is the earliest INK4a/ARF change in the evolution of oligodendrogliomas, while the presence of p14ARF and p16INK4a deletions indicates progression to anaplastic oligodendroglioma.",

In order to increase its sensitivity and specificity new markers have been studied and incorporated to cytological and histological methods for diagnosis for cervical cancer, such as p16INK4A that has been considered the immunocytochemical marker of choice for detection of HPV related cancers. We considered that p14ARF could be a complementary marker in order to improve the accuracy of cytological diagnosis because its genetic proximity to p16INK4A. We performed a systematic analysis of several putative cervical cancer markers in order to evaluate their performance in the detection of malignancy, in comparison with p16INK4A and p14ARF, using immunocytochemistry (ICC), immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot analyses. Most markers were non-specific and could not discriminate HPV infected cancer cell lines from other non HPV malignant. In contrast, nuclear co-expression of p16INK4A and p14ARF was observed only in HPV-transformed cancer cell lines. Notably, in C-33A cervical cancer cells (HPV negative), p14ARF was present in the nucleoli, but p16INK4A was conspicuously absent from the nuclei of these cells.

Human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), normal fibroblasts (Hs68 and WI38), HeLa cervical carcinoma and HTB-30 breast carcinoma cells arrest in G(1)/S in response to severe hypoxia. Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells did not exhibit orderly G(1)/S arrest in response to severe hypoxia. We found a general decrease in p16(INK4a) (p16) mRNA levels, with an associated decrease in p16 protein levels in both normal cells and in cancer cells, regardless of their cell cycle response to hypoxia. p27 protein levels did not correlate with the cell line's ability to enter a hypoxic G(1)/S arrest. Furthermore, cell lines that underwent G(1)/S arrest showed decreased expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha) and at least one member of INK4 or Sdi cell cycle kinase inhibitors families after 12-24 h of hypoxia. Conversely, Hep3B, which did not exhibit orderly hypoxia-associated G(1)/S arrest, also did not show decreased HIF-1alpha, INK4 or Sdi protein levels in hypoxia. Furthermore, Hep3B showed constitutive activating phosphorylation of Akt and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3beta, which was the opposite pattern to that exhibited by the cell lines showing the G(1)/S arrest phenotype. Inhibition of GSK3beta by lithium chloride treatment of HeLa cells converted the HIF-1alpha, p16 and p27 loss to levels unchanged by hypoxic exposure. Our results suggest that regulation of the cell cycle during hypoxia in either normal or cancer cells is not simply due to up-regulation of cell cycle kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, decreased protein expression of HIF-1alpha, p16 and p27 was associated with both a hypoxia-induced G(1)/S arrest phenotype and increased GSK3beta activity.",

Promoter methylation was at a less extent involved in gene silencing (18%), and no mutations were found. Loss of function at DNA level strongly correlated with loss of mRNA expression accounting for 80% of the cases. Because of the close relationship between p14(ARF) and TP53 and between p15(INK4b)/p16(INK4a) and Rb, these results support a model of a coinactivation of TP53 and Rb pathways in 75% of MPNSTs, with functional consequences on cell growth control and apoptosis.;The inactivation of the 9p21 locus is a frequent and peculiar hallmark of MPNST genetic profile leading also to an impaired apoptosis that could be taken into account in treatment planning of these tumors.",

We analyzed a series of 59 PSCCs and 8 condylomata for presence of HPV infection, for p16(INK4a), Ki-67, and p53 immunohistochemical expression, and for expression of a panel of cellular miRNAs (let-7c, miR-23b, miR-34a, miR-145, miR-146a, miR-196a, and miR-218) involved in HPV-related cancer. HR-HPV DNA (HPV16 in most cases) was detected in 17/59 (29%) PSCCs; all penile condylomata (8/8) were positive for low-risk HPV6 or HPV11. HR-HPV(+) PSCCs overexpressed p16(INK4a) in 88% cases and p53 in 35% of cases, whereas HR-HPV(-) PSCCs were positive for p16(INK4a) and p53 immunostaining in 9% and 44% of cases, respectively. Among the miRNAs investigated, expression of miR-218 was lower in PSCCs with HR-HPV infection and in p53(-) cancers. Hypermethylation of the promoter of the SLIT2 gene, which contains miR-218-1 in its intronic region, was frequently observed in PSCCs, mainly in those with low miR-218 expression.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of exons 1 and 2 of the gene showed no deletion or gross rearrangement in the p16 gene. The lack of deletion was further demonstrated by Southern blot analysis. Looking for point mutations, we used single-strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and, in half of the tumours, we sequenced both strands of exons 1 and 2. No mutations were detected. In 11 out of 42 patients (26%), however, we detected no protein expression by Western blot analysis, suggesting that decreased expression of p16 rather than deletion of the gene can occur in a significant percentage of human ovarian cancers. In the same experiment CDK4 protein was found homogeneously expressed in all the tumour specimens and in the five cell lines.

Therefore, early diagnosis of high-risk premalignant lesions and incipient cancers is important. HNSCC is currently perceived as a single progression mechanism, resulting in immortal invasive cancers. However, we have found that approximately 40% of primary oral SCCs are mortal in culture, and these have a better prognosis. About 60% of oral premalignancies (dysplasias) are also mortal. The mortal and immortal tumors are generated in vivo as judged by p53 mutations and loss of p16(INK4A) expression being found only in the original tumors from which the immortal cultures were derived. To investigate the relationships of dysplasias to SCCs, we did microarray analysis of primary cultures of 4 normal oral mucosa biopsies, 19 dysplasias, and 16 SCCs. Spectral clustering using the singular value decomposition and other bioinformatic techniques showed that development of mortal and immortal SCCs involves distinct transcriptional changes. Both SCC classes share most of the transcriptional changes found in their respective dysplasias but have additional changes. Moreover, high-risk dysplasias that subsequently progress to SCCs more closely resemble SCCs than nonprogressing dysplasias. This indicates for the first time that there are divergent mortal and immortal pathways for oral SCC development via intermediate dysplasias. We believe that this new information may lead to new ways of classifying HNSCC in relation to prognosis.",

This response may involve a cytostatic effect or the induction of apoptosis depending on the cell context. Often the growth-inhibitory response of type I IFNs is studied in tumor cell lines carrying mutations of tumor suppressor genes, and therefore, the growth-inhibitory effect can be influenced by inactivation of these important regulators of cell proliferation. In this report, we explored the role of the ARF-p53 pathway in the growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFNs. We found that p53 is only induced in cells that express p14(ARF) (p19(ARF) in mouse cells). Surprisingly, mouse embryonal fibroblasts that are null for p19(ARF) or P53, even after transformation with oncogenic RAS, respond as well as wild type to the growth-inhibitory effect of type I IFNs. Similarly, human ARF(-/-) U2OS and P53(-/-) SAOS-2 cells show a significant decrease in cell proliferation. However, only SAOS-2 or U2OS reconstituted with inducible p14(ARF) undergo apoptosis in response to IFN beta treatment, and this effect was not inhibited by expression of dominant negative p53. These data suggest that (i) at least in specific cell types, the induction of apoptosis by type I IFNs requires an ARF pathway that is p53-independent and (ii) the cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects of type I IFNs employ different pathways.",

Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with low dietary folate intake, which is aggravated by high alcohol intake. The relationship between promoter methylation of genes involved in CRC carcinogenesis and folate and alcohol intake was investigated. Methylation of the APC-1A, p14(ARF), p16(INK4A), hMLH1, O(6)-MGMT, and RASSF1A promoters was studied using methylation-specific PCR in 122 sporadic CRCs, derived from patients with folate and alcohol intake at either the lower or the higher quintiles of the distribution. Overall, promoter hypermethylation frequencies observed were: 39% for APC; 33% for p14(ARF); 31% for p16(INK4A); 29% for hMLH1; 41% for O(6)-MGMT; and 20% for RASSF1A. For each of the tested genes, the prevalence of promoter hypermethylation was higher in CRCs derived from patients with low folate/high alcohol intake (n = 61) when compared with CRCs from patients with high folate/low alcohol intake (n = 61), but the differences were not statistically significant. The number of CRCs with at least one gene methylated was higher (84%) in the low folate intake/high alcohol intake group when compared with the high folate intake/low alcohol intake group (70%; P = 0.085). Despite the size limitations of this study, these data suggest that folate and alcohol intake may be associated with changes in promoter hypermethylation in CRC.",

It is therefore important to identify cases that potentially develop higher grades of SIL at an early stage of the disease. In this study, we thus investigated whether immunocytochemistry for p21(WAF1/Cip1) and p16(INK4a) could be applicable in the diagnosis and the prognostic prediction of SIL in combination with genomic analyses of HPV. The genomic analysis of high-risk HPV (hrHPV), which was done by reversed dot blotting and by in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemistry were performed on liquid-based cytological specimens. A cross-sectional study comprising 145 cases of NILM, ASC-US, LSIL, and HSIL indicated that the incidence of the positive cases for p16(INK4a) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) and hrHPV increased with the grade of SIL. A double positive status for p16(INK4a) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) was a significant discriminator between HSIL and LSIL/NILM, even when applied in conjunction with the genomic test for hrHPV (P = 0.006 by logistic regression analysis). However, a prospective study employing 61 NILM/ASC-US cases, revealed that the p16(INK4a) /p21(WAF1/Cip1) immunostaining was not a significant predictor for the progression of SIL, whereas the cytological diagnosis (NILM vs. ASC-US) and the infection status of hrHPV conferred significant effects on the prognosis. Immunostaining of p16(INK4a) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) provides additional information on the cytological diagnosis of SIL. A further analysis using a larger population is warranted to obtain a conclusive result regarding the prognostic significance of p16(INK4a) /p21(WAF1/Cip1) immunocytochemistry in the diagnosis of SIL.",

ARF is part of an ARF-mdm2-p53 network that exerts a negative control on hyperproliferative signals emanating from oncogenic stimuli. Among these is the transcription factor E2F1, a final effector of the RB pathway, that induces ARF expression. Recent data suggest that ARF function is not restricted to the p53 pathway. However, ARF target(s) implicated in this p53-independent function remains to be identified. We show that ARF is able to inhibit the proliferation of human cell lines independently of their p53 status. In this context, we demonstrate that ARF interacts physically with E2F1 and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Moreover, we show that mdm2 is required for the modulation of E2F1 activity by ARF. Beside the well-known p53 and mdm2 partners, these results identify E2F1 as a new ARF target. Thus, ARF can be viewed as a dual-acting tumour suppressor protein in both the p53 and RB pathways, further emphasizing its role in tumour surveillance.",

We studied primary samples of 100 patients with lymphoid leukaemias [B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), n = 23; T-ALL, n = 7; B-cell chronic lymphocytic (B-CLL) or prolymphocytic (B-PLL) leukaemia, n = 50; T-CLL/T-PLL, n = 20] using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with eight overlapping cosmid clones covering the region on chromosome band 9p21 containing CDKN2. We did not observe any CDKN2 deletions in the 70 patients with chronic lymphoid leukaemias of B- or T-cell origin. Of the 23 patients with B-lineage ALL, one (4%) exhibited a CDKN2 deletion: in this patient, two clones were detected, one exhibiting a hemizygous and the other a homozygous deletion. On chromosome banding analysis, four patients with B-lineage ALL had a 9p aberration, whereas all CDKN2 copies were retained. In contrast, six of the seven (86%) patients with T-ALL exhibited CDKN2 deletions (homozygous, n = 4; hemizygous, n = 2). We conclude that hemizygous or homozygous deletions of the CDKN2 gene occur at high frequency in T-ALL and at low frequency in B-lineage ALL, supporting the role of this gene as a tumour suppressor, especially in T-ALL.

This study searched for targeted therapies that might synergize with CDK4/6 inhibition in this setting.

Sensitivity to this drug combination correlated with reduced activity of the master cell growth regulator mTORC1. Accordingly, replacing the IGF1R/IR inhibitor with the rapalog inhibitor temsirolimus broadened the sensitivity of PDAC cells to CDK4/6 inhibition.

Previously, we have documented the in vivo inactivation of p16INK4A, an inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases, in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region. In the present study, we extend these findings by examining the expression and functional activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory subunits using a model system of cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinomas. Increased activity of CDK4 and 6 was universal in tumor cells compared with normal keratinocytes, reflecting over-expression of either or both kinases. In contrast to other studies, over-expression of cyclin D1, a regulatory subunit of CDK4 and 6, was not observed. Increased activity of CDK2 was less frequent and was related to over-expression of cyclin A and/or E. All tumor cell lines showed increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen compared to normal keratinocytes. Four SCC cell lines, including one tumor-metastasis pair derived from a single patient, failed to express the p15INK4B transcript. Western blot analysis of cell lysates revealed normal or reduced levels of p27KIP1 in tumor cells compared to normal keratinocytes. However, failure to express wild-type p53 was not reflected by lower levels of p21WAF1. Our data suggest that cell-cycle deregulation is likely to occur by multiple mechanisms during the genesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Furthermore, p16INK4A is likely to be the primary target for inactivation on chromosome 9p21 in these tumors as p15INK4B loss occurs less frequently.",

In this study, we examined the correlation between PGE2 receptor 2 (EP2) expression and p16INK4A methylation in NSCLC, and the association with clinicopathological features and prognostic significance. We retrospectively reviewed 88 NSCLC patients who underwent resection from July 1993 to May 1997. The tumors included 43 adenocarcinomas, 39 squamous cell carcinomas, and 6 large cell carcinomas. EP2 expression was determined by immunostaining, and p16INK4A methylation was analyzed by methylation specific PCR. EP2 was overexpressed in 44% of NSCLC patients, 61% of adenocarcinoma cases, 28% of squamous cell carcinoma cases, and 33% of large cell carcinoma cases. EP2 expression positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.034), especially in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.009). Methylation of p16INK4A was detected in 34% of NSCLC patients, 23% of adenocarcinoma cases, 44% of squamous cell carcinoma cases, and 50% of large cell carcinoma cases. In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, EP2 overexpression correlated with poor prognosis with a relative risk of 2.4 (confidence interval 2.1-51.8, P<0.003), and positively correlated with p16INK4A methylation (P<0.024). Adenocarcinoma patients with p16INK4A methylation had poor prognosis with a relative risk of 2.4 (confidence interval 1.8-69.7, P<0.009), but this was not correlated with EP2 expression. In conclusion, EP2 overexpression was common in NSCLCs, especially in adenocarcinomas. Synchronous alteration of p16INK4A and EP2 may accelerate progression of squamous cell carcinomas. These two alterations may differentially affect pathogenesis among subtypes of NSCLC.",

Missing p16 data was estimated using multiple (n=100) imputation (MI) and validated using an independent OPC cohort (n=214).

The DNA repair genes are the best candidates for caretaker genes as exemplified by the human hereditary xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) syndrome. Cultured XP cells are hypermutable after UVB irradiation. This increased mutation frequency is also found in gatekeeper genes, which govern signalling pathways implicated in the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival of human epidermal keratinocytes. We describe and discuss the role of mutated gatekeeper genes in five specific signalling pathways which have been implicated in skin carcinogenesis. The pathways we focus on in this review are: (i) P16(INK4A)-CDK4/6-RB; (ii) P14(ARF)-HDM2-P53; (iii) Sonic hedgehog (SHH)/GLI; (iv) WNT/beta-catenin; and (v) Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)/SMAD. 70-80% of XP skin cancers exhibit one or several mutations in the P53, PTCH-1, SMO or CDKN2A genes, the type and frequency of mutated genes being different between squamous cell (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). In XP cancers, the typically UVB-induced CC to TT tandem transitions represent approximately 60% of total mutations compared to 10-15% in skin tumours from DNA repair-proficient patients. Acquired activation of the pathways described herein can alter proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, allowing a damaged cell to replicate and give rise to mutated daughter cells, then eventually to the development of the carcinogenic process following clonal selection.",

We investigated the status of the p16 gene in pediatric leukemias using 12 established cell lines of differing phenotypes and their corresponding primary leukemic cells. Six of 12 cell lines, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lines of T-cell (three of four), of precursor-B cell (two of four) and of mixed phenotype (one of four), showed homozygous deletion of the p16 gene using PCR and Southern blotting. Comparison of the cell lines with their corresponding primary leukemic cells clearly showed that in all 12 paired samples there were identical findings with respect to the presence or absence of the p16 gene, demonstrating that loss of the gene was a feature of the primary leukemic cells. This is the first study to show this correlation using a panel of paired samples, indicating that p16 gene deletions were not an artifact of in vitro cell culture.

In MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, expression of the tumor suppressor gene p14(ARF) fails to trigger apoptosis but induces an arrest in the G1 and, to a lesser extent, in the G2 phase in the cell division cycle. Here, inhibition of cell cycle arrest resulted in apoptosis induction in caspase-3 proficient MCF-7 cells upon expression of p14(ARF) . This occurred in the absence of S-phase progression or mitotic entry. In contrast, syngeneic, caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells remained entirely resistant to p14(ARF) -induced apoptosis. Thus, cell cycle checkpoint abrogation overcomes resistance to p14(ARF) -induced cell death and promotes cell death via a caspase-3-dependent pathway. Cell death coincided with dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and was inhibitable by pan-caspase inhibitors and the caspase-3/7 inhibitor zDEVD-fmk. Of note, mitochondrial events of apoptosis execution depended entirely on caspase-3 proficiency indicating that caspase-3 either acts \"up-stream\" of the mitochondria in a \"non-canonical\" pathway or mediates a mitochondrial feedback loop to amplify the apoptotic caspase signal in p14(ARF) -induced stress signaling.

In the present study, p16(INK4A) levels in human ATMs and the role of p16(INK4A) in acquiring the ATM phenotype were assessed.;Gene expression of p16                            (                               INK4A                            ) in ATMs was analysed and compared with that in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from obese patients or with macrophages from human atherosclerotic plaques (AMs). Additionally, p16(INK4A) levels were studied during macrophage differentiation and polarisation of monocytes isolated from healthy donors. The role of p16(INK4A) in MDMs from healthy donors was investigated by small interfering (si)RNA-mediated silencing or adenovirus-mediated overproduction of p16(INK4A).;Compared with MDMs and AMs, ATMs from obese patients expressed lower levels of p16                            (                               INK4A                            ). In vitro, IL-4-induced M2 polarisation resulted in lower p16(INK4A) protein levels after differentiation of monocytes from healthy donors in macrophages. Silencing of p16(INK4A) in MDMs mediated by siRNA increased the expression of M2 marker genes and enhanced the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to give a phenotype resembling that of ATM. By contrast, adenovirus-mediated overproduction of p16(INK4A) in MDMs diminished M2 marker gene expression and the response to LPS. Western blot analysis revealed that p16(INK4A) overproduction inhibits LPS- and palmitate-induced Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells (NF-κB) signalling.;These results show that p16(INK4A) inhibits the acquisition of the ATM phenotype. The age-related increase in p16(INK4A) level may thus influence normal ATM function and contribute to type 2 diabetes risk.",

Loss of p16(INK4a) functional activity is frequently observed in tumor cells, and is thought to be one of the primary causes of carcinogenesis. In contrast, despite the biochemical similarity to p16(INK4a), the frequency of defects in p15(INK4b) was found to be lower than in p16(INK4a), suggesting that p15(INK4b)-inductive agents may be useful for tumor suppression. Here we report the discovery of a novel pyrido-pyrimidine derivative, JTP-70902, which exhibits p15(INK4b)-inducing activity in p16(INK4a)-inactivated human colon cancer HT-29 cells. JTP-70902 also induced another CDK-inhibitor, p27(KIP1), and downregulated the expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1, resulting in G(1) cell cycle arrest. MEK1/2 was identified by compound-immobilized affinity chromatography as the molecular target of JTP-70902, and this was further confirmed by the inhibitory activity of JTP-70902 against MEK1/2 in kinase assays. JTP-70902 suppressed the growth of most colorectal and some other cancer cell lines in vitro, and showed antitumor activity in an HT-29 xenograft model. However, JTP-70902 did not inhibit the growth of COLO320 DM cells; in these, constitutive extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation was not detected, and neither p15(INK4b) nor p27(KIP1) induction was observed. Moreover, p15(INK4b)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were found to be more resistant to the growth-inhibitory effect of JTP-70902 than wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These findings suggest that JTP-70902 restores CDK inhibitor-mediated cell cycle control by inhibiting MEK1/2 and exerts a potent antitumor effect.",

These include mutations that activate Ras and two of its effector cascades, Raf and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Induction of Ras and Raf can be caused by active N-Ras and B-Raf mutants as well as by gene amplification. Activation of PI3K pathway components occurs by PTEN loss and by AKT3 amplification. Melanomas also commonly show impairment of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-Rb and ARF-HDM2-p53 tumor suppressor pathways. CDKN2A mutations can produce p16(INK4A) and ARF protein loss. Rb bypass can also occur through activating CDK4 mutations as well as by CDK4 amplification. In addition to ARF deletion, p53 pathway disruption can result from dominant negative TP53 mutations. TERT amplification also occurs in melanoma. The extent to which these mutations can induce human melanocytic neoplasia is unknown.

DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of 93 astrocytic tumors was available for CDKN2A promoter methylation analysis and p16(INK4A) expression by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A strong negative correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining and CDKN2A promoter methylation was found. Additionally, a significant negative correlation between CDKN2A promoter methylation and age was observed; also, female patients had statistically more CDKN2A methylated promoters (p = 0.036) than men.

We aimed to find a detection algorithm of a biologically and thus clinically meaningful infection, applicable for high-throughput screening of frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens. By considering detection of HPV E6 oncogene expression in frozen biopsies as gold standard for a meaningful HPV infection, the value of several assays was evaluated on FFPE tumor specimens and sera of 48 HNSCC patients. The following assays were evaluated on FFPE tissue samples: HPV DNA general primer (GP)5+/6+ PCR, viral load analysis, HPV16 DNA FISH detection, HPV16 E6 mRNA RT-PCR, p16 immunostaining, and on corresponding serum samples detection of antibodies against the HPV16 proteins L1, E6 and E7. Comparing single assays on FFPE tissue samples detection of E6 expression by RT-PCR was superior, but application remains at present limited to HPV16 detection. Most suitable algorithm with 100% sensitivity and specificity appeared p16 immunostaining followed by GP5+/6+ PCR on the p16-positive cases. We show that clinically meaningful viral HPV infections can be more reliably measured in FFPE HNSCC samples in a standard and high throughput manner, paving the way for prognostic and experimental vaccination studies, regarding not only HNSCC, but possibly also cancer types with HPV involvement in subgroups such as penile and anal cancer.",

To address this issue, we have generated composite tamoxifen-inducible intestine-specific genetic mouse models and analyzed the expression of intestinal differentiation markers. Importantly, we found that activation of β-catenin partially rescues the differentiation phenotype of Rbpj deletion mutants, but not the loss of the ISC compartment. Moreover, we identified Bmi1, which is expressed in the ISC and progenitor compartments, as a gene that is co-regulated by Notch and β-catenin. Loss of Bmi1 resulted in reduced proliferation in the ISC compartment accompanied by p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) (splice variants of Cdkn2a) accumulation, and increased differentiation to the post-mitotic goblet cell lineage that partially mimics Notch loss-of-function defects.

As many of these evaluations are obscured by a heterogeneity of treatments, the current study aimed to evaluate the incidence and prognostic value of the promoter hypermethylation of TIMP3, CDH1, DAPK, RASSF1A, p16INK4A and MGMT in HNSCC treated solely by radiotherapy. In 46 patients with advanced HNSCC treated with a hybrid accelerated fractionation radiotherapy schedule, DNA extracted from pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies was used to determine the methylation status of the genes of interest by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The detected epigenetic silencing was related with outcome in terms of locoregional control (LRC), and overall (OS), disease-free (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Tumor biopsies revealed the epigenetic silencing of MGMT in 42.5% (17 of 40) of patients and of TIMP3 in 40.5% (17 of 42) of cases. For the remaining investigated genes, a lower methylation percentage was detected: 13.2% (5 of 38) for CDH1, 11.4% (4 of 44) for DAPK, 4.8% (2 of 42) for p16INK4A and 2.4% (1 of 41) for RASSF1A.

In PSCC the attributable fraction to human papillomavirus (HPV) is not well established.;We sought to provide novel data about the prevalence of HPV in a large series of penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN) and invasive PSCC, correlating the results with the histologic subtype, p16(INK4a) immunostaining, and prognosis.;A total of 82 PSCC were included in the study, 69 invasive and 13 PeIN. HPV detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction with SPF-10 broad-spectrum primers followed by DNA enzyme immunoassay and genotyping with a reverse hybridization line probe assay. P16(INK4a) immunohistochemical expression on tissue microarrays was also analyzed.;HPV DNA was identified in 31 of 77 (40.2%) PSCC (22 of 67 invasive and 9 of 10 PeIN). In 25 of 31 (80.6%) cases HPV-16 was identified. HPV detection was significantly associated with some histologic subtypes: most basaloid and warty tumors were high-risk HPV (hrHPV) positive, whereas only 15% of usual PSCC were hr-HPV positive. All hrHPV-positive PSCC had an adjacent undifferentiated PeIN. Strong p16(INK4a) immunostaining correlated with hrHPV infection. Most undifferentiated PeIN showed p16(INK4a) immunohistochemical overexpression. Both hrHPV-positive and p16(INK4a)-positive tumors showed a better overall survival without reaching statistical significance.;This was a retrospective study.;Our results suggest that most hrHPV-positive PSCC develop from undifferentiated hrHPV-positive PeIN. P16(INK4a) immunostaining may be useful in identifying both etiologically related hrHPV-positive tumors and those with better outcome. The routine use of p16(INK4a) staining should be incorporated in histologic evaluation of PSCC.",

Complex interactions between a set of molecules, cell cycle proteins, tumour suppressor genes, oncogenes and the telomerase, occur in the multiple step process of carcinogenesis. The 2 main ways of control of the cell cycle rely on 2 tumour suppressor genes: the P53 gene and the retinoblastoma gene or RB gene. One of the regulation pathways or the 2 regulation pathways are disabled during the development of oral and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Most of the time, the inactivation of the P53 pathway results from a loss of function of the p53 protein, secondary to mutation and/or deletion of the P53 gene; It may also result of the amplification of the MDM2 gene and of the inactivation of the arf protein. The RB pathway leads to cell proliferation by loss of the p16 protein, by amplification of the cyclin D1 gene and less frequently by mutation of the RB gene or loss of the retinoblastoma protein. In India and South-East Asia, the activation of RAS and MYC oncogenes appears to be related with the presence of specific carcinogens in snuff and tobacco.

We retrospectively analyzed the mRNA levels of SUV39H1 and the promoter methylation of the p14(ARF), p16(INK4a) and HLTF genes as well as the mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in fresh frozen tissues from 219 colorectal cancer patients. The mRNA levels of the SUV39H1 and DNMT1 were assessed via quantitative real-time PCR and the methylation profiles of the CpG islands were determined using methylation-specific PCR. The mRNA levels of SUV39H1 and DNMT1 were elevated in 25% and 42% of 219 colorectal cancers, respectively. The hypermethylation of the p14(ARF), p16(INK4a) and HLTF genes occurred in 36%, 51% and 34% of the patients. The elevated mRNA levels of SUV39H1 were not associated with the hypermethylation of the 3 genes. However, the mRNA levels of DNMT1 were significantly different between patients with elevated mRNA levels of SUV39H1 and those without (1.62 +/- 0.84, 0.91 +/- 0.81, respectively; p = 0.007). Patients with elevated mRNA levels of SUV39H1 showed a higher prevalence of DNMT1 elevation than those without (61 vs. 35%, p = 0.0008). Patients with an elevated mRNA level of SUV39H1 had a 2.71 (95% CI = 1.09-4.48, p = 0.002) times greater risk of an elevated mRNA level of DNMT1, after controlling for age and gender.

As p16(INK4a) and Ki-67 co-expression clearly indicates deregulation of the cell cycle, the aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 dual labelling in urinary cytology samples.;Immunolabelling was performed in demounted, destained Papanicolaou slides after ThinPrep(®) processing. A total of 84 urinary cytology samples (18 negative, 10 low grade, 19 atypical urothelial cells and 37 high grade) were analysed for p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression. We assessed underlying urothelial malignancy with cystoscopy, histopathology and follow-up data in every case.;Compared with raw histopathological results, p16 (INK4a) /Ki-67 dual labelling was observed in 48 out of 55 (87.3%) HG lesions and in 11 out of 29 (37.9%) negative, papillary urothelial neoplasia of low malignant potential or low-grade carcinomas (P = 0.05). All cases with high-grade/malignant cytology were dual labelled. Sixteen out of 17 (94.1%) carcinoma in situ cases and eight out of 14 (57.1%) cases with atypical urothelial cells matching with HG lesions were dual labelled. Extended follow-up allowed three cases of progression to be diagnosed in dual-labelled cases with negative/low-grade cytology results after a 9- to 11-months delay.;The data show that p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression allows most HG cancer cells to be detected initially and in the follow-up period. Additional studies are needed in order to determine whether dual labelling can be used as a triage tool for atypical urothelial cells in the urine.",

MRTs are extremely aggressive cancers caused by the loss of the hSNF5 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. We found previously that, in MRT cells, hSNF5 is required for p16(INK4a) induction, mitotic checkpoint activation, and cellular senescence. Here, we investigated how the balance between Polycomb group (PcG) silencing and SWI/SNF activation affects epigenetic control of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus in MRT cells. hSNF5 reexpression in MRT cells caused SWI/SNF recruitment and activation of p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a), but not of p14(ARF). Gene activation by hSNF5 is strictly dependent on the SWI/SNF motor subunit BRG1. SWI/SNF mediates eviction of the PRC1 and PRC2 PcG silencers and extensive chromatin reprogramming. Concomitant with PcG complex removal, the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein is recruited and active histone marks supplant repressive ones. Strikingly, loss of PcG complexes is accompanied by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B dissociation and reduced DNA methylation. Thus, various chromatin states can be modulated by SWI/SNF action. Collectively, these findings emphasize the close interconnectivity and dynamics of diverse chromatin modifications in cancer and gene control.",

In addition, primary melanomas and metastases contain cells expressing the stem cell marker nestin suggesting a hierarchical structure of the tumors comprised of primitive nestin-expressing precursors and differentiated cells.

Whereas inactivation of p16INK4a has been described as a frequent event in lung cancer, the current function of p19ARF is still poorly understood. We have examined the expression of the human p19ARF (hp19ARF) protein in a large series of lung cancers using immunohistochemistry and showed that the protein was more frequently lost in high-grade neuroendocrine (NE) lung tumors (large cell NE carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma; 51 of 78, 65%) than it was in non-small cell lung cancer (25 of 101, 25%). No deleterious mutation was found in exons 1beta and 2 of hp19ARF in those NE tumors with negative immunoreactivity, and a beta transcript was detected in the majority of them. Concomitant absence of hp19ARF and retinoblastoma proteins was frequently detected in high-grade NE lung tumors, whereas no relationship could be found between the status of hp19ARF and p53 proteins in those tumors.

The central role of the nervous system in the maintenance of vital activities and the functional consequences of the loss of neurons can explain how severe brain cancers are. The cell cycle is a highly complex process, with a wide number of regulatory proteins involved, and such proteins can suffer alterations that transform normal cells into malignant ones. The INK4 family members (CDK inhibitors) are the cell cycle regulators that block the progression of the cycle through the R point, causing an arrest in G1 stage. The p14ARF (alternative reading frame) gene is a tumor suppressor that inhibits p53 degradation during the progression of the cell cycle. The PTEN gene is related to the induction of growth suppression through cell cycle arrest, to apoptosis and to the inhibition of cell adhesion and migration. The purpose of the present study was to assess the mutational state of the genes p14ARF, p15INK4b, p16INK4a, and PTEN in 64 human nervous system tumor samples. Homozygous deletions were found in exon 2 of the p15INK4b gene and exon 3 of the p16INK4a gene in two schwannomas. Three samples showed a guanine deletion (63 codon) which led to a loss of heterozygosity in the p15 gene, and no alterations could be seen in the PTEN gene.

The EBV oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is frequently expressed in NPC tumours and may play a role in the genesis of the disease. NPC tumours often exhibit loss of expression (by deletion or methylation) of the INK4a locus, which encodes the tumour suppressor genes p16INK4a and p14ARF. To investigate the contribution of LMP1 and INK4a loss to tumourigenesis, skin chemical carcinogenesis was conducted using PyLMP1 and INK4a null mice. Surprisingly, INK4a null mice developed significantly fewer papillomas than wild-type mice, nevertheless, the papillomas that did develop grew faster and converted more rapidly to carcinoma than controls. This indicates that while loss of the INK4a locus plays an important role in the later stages of tumourigenesis, initially its loss inhibits papilloma formation. Conversely, LMP1 promoted papilloma formation but paradoxically inhibited papilloma growth. Using cross-breeds, it was found that LMP1 cooperates with loss of the INK4a locus during epithelial tumourigenesis. The expression of LMP1 overcame the inhibition of papilloma formation observed in INK4a null mice, whilst the loss of the INK4a locus counteracted the inhibition of papilloma growth rate found in PyLMP1 mice. This suggests that LMP1 mediates the inhibition of papilloma growth via one or both of the INK4a locus products. Intriguingly, mice heterozygous for INK4a loss showed lesion growth rates intermediate between wild-type and null, demonstrative of haploinsufficiency. We propose that LMP1 acts at the early stages in carcinogenesis to promote the development of benign tumours and that early reduction of INK4a locus expression allows these lesions to expand in size. In addition, loss of the INK4a locus accelerates the development of a more aggressive lesion. Conversely, complete loss of the INK4a locus in an otherwise normal cell might inhibit lesion formation.",

The goal of this study was to determine whether the hybrid capture-2 (HC-2) assay, already widely used for the detection of high risk HPV in cervical brushings, is applicable to cytologic specimens obtained from patients with suspected HNSCCs.;Fine needle aspirates (FNA) of cervical lymph nodes were pre-operatively obtained from patients with suspected HNSCCs and evaluated for the presence of HPV using the HC-2 assay. HPV analysis was performed on the corresponding resected tissue specimens using p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HR-HPV in situ hybridization (ISH). A cost analysis was performed using the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services.;HPV status of the cervical lymph node metastases was correctly classified using the HC-2 assay in 84% (21/25) of cases. Accuracy was improved to 100% when cytologic evaluation confirmed the presence of cancer cells in the test samples. The estimated cost savings to CMS using the HC-2 assay ranged from $113.74 to $364.63 per patient.;HC-2 is a reliable method for determining the HPV status of HNSCCs. Its application to HNSCCs may reduce costs by helping to localize the primary site during the diagnostic work-up as well as decrease the interval time of determining the HPV status which would be relevant for providing prognostic information to the patient as well as determining eligibility for clinical trials targeting this unique patient population.",

The viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins inactivate the p53 and pRb proteins, respectively. We examined the causative effect of HPV16 E6 and E7 expression on the immortalization of normal oral keratinocytes (OKCs) and compared the resulting phenotype with alternative ways of p53- and pRb-pathway abrogation frequently found in HNSCCs without HPV. Primary OKCs were conditionally immortalized with temperature-sensitive SV40 large T-antigen and human telomerase, allowing these cells to return to their senescent primary state after temperature shift. HPV16 E6 and E7 were introduced to overcome senescence, determined with population doubling (PD) as read-out. For comparison, we downregulated p53 and p16 by short hairpin RNA genes and expressed mutant p53R(175)H and cyclinD1. Expression of HPV16 E6 caused an extended life span similar to expression of mutant p53R(175)H or p53 knockdown. Expression of mutant p53R(175)H seemed to cause additional activation of the hypoxia and WNT signaling pathways. HPV16 E7 expression had no direct effect on lifespan, similar to p16 knockdown or cyclinD1 expression. In combination with HPV16 E6 or other functional inactivations of p53, abrogation of the pRb-pathway by either HPV16 E7 or other manipulations caused an immortal phenotype. Our data show the causative role of HPV16 E6/E7 in early squamous carcinogenesis. Activity of each gene could be mimicked by other genetic events frequently found in HNSCC without HPV. This data provides the experimental proof of causal association of HPV in HNSCC carcinogenesis and further support the crucial role of the p53- and pRb-pathways.",

However, the respective timeframes and signal thresholds for ARF induction and DDR activation during tumorigenesis remain elusive. Here, these issues were addressed by analyses of mouse models of urinary bladder, colon, pancreatic and skin premalignant and malignant lesions. Consistently, ARF expression occurred at a later stage of tumor progression than activation of the DDR or p16(INK4A), a tumor-suppressor gene overlapping with ARF. Analogous results were obtained in several human clinical settings, including early and progressive lesions of the urinary bladder, head and neck, skin and pancreas. Mechanistic analyses of epithelial and fibroblast cell models exposed to various oncogenes showed that the delayed upregulation of ARF reflected a requirement for a higher, transcriptionally based threshold of oncogenic stress, elicited by at least two oncogenic 'hits', compared with lower activation threshold for DDR. We propose that relative to DDR activation, ARF provides a complementary and delayed barrier to tumor development, responding to more robust stimuli of escalating oncogenic overload. ",

To determine whether alterations in these genes play a role in disease progression, we analyzed a panel of 18 matched specimen pairs collected from children with ALL at the time of initial diagnosis and first bone marrow relapse for homozygous p16 and/or p15 deletions or p15 promoter hypermethylation. Four sample pairs contained homozygous p16 and p15 deletions at both diagnosis and relapse. Among the 14 pairs that were p16/p15 germline at diagnosis, three ALLs developed homozygous deletions of both p16 and p15, and two developed homozygous p16 deletions and retained p15 germline status at relapse. In two patients, p15 promoter hypermethylation developed in the interval between initial diagnosis and relapse. In total, homozygous p16 deletions were present in nine of 18 cases, homozygous p15 deletions in seven of 18 cases, and p15 promoter hypermethylation in two of eight cases at relapse. These findings indicate that loss of function of proteins encoded by p16 and/or p15 plays an important role in the biology of relapsed childhood ALL, and is associated with disease progression in a subset of cases.",

We examined 20 mouse lung epithelial cell lines (2 nontumorigenic, 5 nonmetastatic, and 13 metastatic) for mutations or alterations in the expression of key components of the Rb pathway (pRb and p16INK4a) and the p53 pathway (p53 and p19ARF). Seven cell lines had a mutation in exons 5 to 8 of p53. p19ARF was inactivated in the remaining 13 cell lines, primarily by homozygous deletion. Rb expression was present and unaltered in all cell lines, with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated protein forms detectable. p16INK4a transcripts were undetectable in all cell lines tested except LM1. Loss of p16INK4a expression was a result of homozygous deletion in 11 out of 20 lung cell lines and promoter-exon 1 hypermethylation in 6 out of the remaining 8 cell lines. Other related components that were examined in this study included p21WAF1 and cyclin D1. Compared to normal lung tissue, p21WAF1 expression levels were reduced or undetectable in all cell lines, which did not correlate with loss of p53 function, but did correlate with inactivation of either p53 or p19ARF. Although cyclin D1 expression was variable between cell lines, transcript levels were decreased by at least 50% in the nontumorigenic lines C10 and E10 compared to the tumorigenic cell lines. These results demonstrate mutually exclusive relationships between p53 and p19ARF and between Rb and p16INK4a, but perhaps not between cyclin D1 and p16INK4a, and further describe the nature of involvement of both pathways in mouse lung tumorigenesis.",

Sixteen (30%) of the carcinomas were found to harbour high-risk HPV DNA, 15 of which contained HPV 16.

This supports an active role for HPV E7 in interfering with the p16(INK4A)/cyclin D/Rb pathway.

        "Doc_abstract":"The p14(ARF) tumor suppressor is frequently targeted for inactivation in many human cancers and in individuals predisposed to cutaneous melanoma. The functions of p14(ARF) are closely linked with its subcellular distribution. Nucleolar p14(ARF) dampens ribosome biosynthesis and nucleoplasmic forms of p14(ARF) activate the p53 pathway and induce cell cycle arrest. p14(ARF) can also be recruited to mitochondria where it interacts with many mitochondrial proteins, including Bcl-x(L) and p32 to induce cell death. It has been suggested that the movement of p14(ARF) to mitochondria requires its interaction with p32, but we now show that the ARF-p32 interaction is not necessary for the accumulation of p14(ARF) in mitochondria. Instead, highly hydrophobic domains within the amino-terminal half of p14(ARF) act as mitochondrial import sequences. We suggest that once this hydrophobic pocket is exposed, possibly in a stimulus-dependent manner, it accelerates the mitochondrial import of p14(ARF). This allows the interaction of p14(ARF) with mitochondrial proteins, including p32 and enables p53-independent cell death.",

Knock-in mice expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) in lieu of Arf coding sequences allow analysis of Arfpromoter regulation uncoupled from p19Arf action. Prior to frank lymphoma development, unexpectedly low levels of Emu-Myc-induced p19Arf or GFP were expressed. However, as lymphomas arose in Arf+/GFP heterozygotes, additional oncogenic events synergized with Emu-Myc to further induce the functionally null Arf-Gfp allele. Concomitant up-regulation of p19Arf was not observed; instead, the wild-type allele was inactivated. We infer that very low levels of Arf are tumor suppressive, and that further induction provides the selective pressure for the emergence of tumors that have inactivated the gene.",

However, its expression in vulvar carcinomas, which have a diverse pathogenesis, has not been extensively studied. One hundred seventy-seven vulvar intraepithelial neoplasms (VIN), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and benign squamous epithelia were analyzed for p16 expression. RNA/RNA in situ hybridization was used to detect HPV 16 E6/E7 transcripts in 112. Ninety-five percent of VIN 3 and basaloid or warty SCCs (76/80) and 4% of keratinizing SCC (2/48) were moderately to strongly immunopositive for p16, which localized to nucleus and cytoplasm; 52/58 analyzed (90%) contained HPV 16 transcripts. The positive predictive value (PPV) of moderate to strong diffuse p16 immunostaining and HPV positivity for the diagnosis of VIN 3 and of basaloid or warty SCC was 97% and 95%, respectively. Conversely, 94% of keratinizing SCC contained heterogeneous staining, and when present, it was strictly cytoplasmic and frequently localized to the cells at the epithelial-stromal interface. Benign squamous epithelia were p16 negative, with the exception of lichen sclerosus, which contained focal and heterogeneously p16 positive in 42%. As in the cervix, intense diffuse p16 expression supports an HPV-related neoplastic process in vulvar neoplasia, irrespective of the level of differentiation. Up-regulation of p16 at the epithelial-stromal interface in HPV negative keratinizing SCCs is consistent with an HPV-independent response to alterations associated with invasion.

In this study, we characterized the effects of two novel biosynthetically engineered analogs of pactamycin, de-6MSA-7-demethyl-7-deoxypactamycin (TM-025) and 7-demethyl-7-deoxypactamycin (TM-026), in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines SCC25 and SCC104. Both TM-025 and TM-026 exert growth inhibitory effects on HNSCC cells by inhibiting cell proliferation. Interestingly, unlike their parent compound pactamycin, the analogs do not inhibit synthesis of nascent protein in a cell-based assay. Furthermore, they do not induce apoptosis or autophagy in a dose- or a time-dependent manner, but induce mild senescence in the tested cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that both analogs significantly induce cell cycle arrest of the HNSCC cells at S-phase resulting in reduced accumulation of G2/M-phase cells. The pactamycin analogs induce expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins including master regulator p53, its downstream target p21Cip1/WAF1, p27kip21, p19, cyclin E, total and phospho Cdc2 (Tyr15) and Cdc25C. Besides, the analogs mildly reduce cyclin D1 expression without affecting expression of cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cdk4. Specific inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-α reduces the percentage of cells accumulated in S-phase, suggesting contribution of p53 to S-phase increase. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Pactamycin analogs TM-025 and TM-026 induce senescence and inhibit proliferation of HNSCC cells via accumulation in S-phase through possible contribution of p53. The two PCT analogs can be widely used as research tools for cell cycle inhibition studies in proliferating cancer cells with specific mechanisms of action. ",

We show that DEX induced cell proliferation is paralleled by a decrease in Cdkn2a gene transcripts, suggesting a mechanism for hormone promotion. The mechanisms of progression into hormone independent cell lines were examined. Twenty-two of 30 clones which reached a population size of approximately 10(6) cells could be established as cell lines.

Despite the frequent use of p16(INK4a) as a surrogate marker for HPV-infection, there is still controversy with respect to its reliability. This study has been undertaken to assess the potential role of p16(INK 4a) and Ki-67 expression in HPV-related lesions. The study was conducted on 71 specimens of oral, tonsillar and laryngeal lesions which comprised 25 dysplasia and 46 papilloma specimens. Specimens were immunohistochemically stained for p16(INK4A) and Ki-67 proteins. HPV DNA was determined by one step multiplex polymerase chain reaction. HPV DNA was detected in 33.8% of all lesions. Tonsil and larynx lesions showed significant differences with oral lesions for HPV positivity (p < 0.001). p16(INK 4a) over-expression was seen in 56.5% of papilloma and 60% of dysplasia specimens. HPV status showed a positive correlation with p16(INK 4a) expression in tonsillar dysplasias (p < 0.001). p16(INK 4a) expression may have a value as a marker in high risk HPV induced dysplasias, but not in low risk infected lesions. The proliferation index is not related to HPV-induced lesions and may be evaluated as an independent marker in head and neck premalignant lesions.",

It has been shown that p14(ARF) expression is frequently down-regulated by p14(ARF) gene hypermethylation in colorectal cancer. To determine whether p14(ARF) inactivation was involved in ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated carcinogenesis, the frequency and timing of p14(ARF) methylation was investigated in four different histological stages of UC-associated carcinogenesis. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing were used to determine the prevalence of p14(ARF) gene methylation. p14(ARF) methylation was observed in 19 of 38 (50%) adenocarcinomas, 4 of 12 (33%) dysplasias, and 3 of the 5 (60%) nonneoplastic UC mucosae. In contrast, 3 of 40 (3.7%) normal tissues showed p14(ARF) methylation (chi(2) test: P = 0.0003). Bisulfite sequencing was used to analyze 28 CpGs of p14(ARF) gene in 20 samples. The number of methylated CpGs ranged from 0 to 4, 0 to 20, and 0 to 28 in the normal, dysplastic, and carcinomatous samples, respectively (Kruskall-Wallis test: P = 0.0005). Densely methylated alleles were detected only in carcinomas by bisulfite sequencing. In conclusion, our data suggest that methylation of p14(ARF) is a relatively common early event in UC-associated carcinogenesis. p14(ARF) offers potential as a biomarker for the early detection of cancer or dysplasia in UC. Finally, analyses of p14(ARF) methylation in other organs should explore not only frank cancers but other premalignant lesions.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Surgery, radiation, or hormone deprivation alone does not adequately affect local control of clinical or pathologic stage T3 prostate cancer. Lack of local cancer control ultimately leads to a higher incidence of morbidity, distant metastasis, and decreased survival, with patients having disease-specific mortality exceeding 75%. Other novel therapies against this devastating and common disease are needed for the achievement of long-term local cancer control. For this purpose, therapeutic interventions should target prostate-cancer cells at the molecular and cellular level in ways not possible by current modalities of cancer treatment. Any strategy that can modify the biologic behavior of these cells may potentially have the most significant clinical impact. As prostate cancer represents an accumulation of genetic mutations that causes a prostate cell to lose the ability to control its growth, one new approach against prostate cancer may be gene therapy. Identification of key missing or mutated tumor-suppressor genes that, when replaced, may inhibit or destroy prostate-cancer cells may have the best chance of clinical success. One such gene appears to be tumor-suppressor gene p16 (also known as MTS1, INK4A, and CDKN2). Tumor-suppressor gene p16 is an important negative cell-cycle regulator whose functional loss may significantly contribute to malignant transformation and progression. Alterations in the p16 gene and its protein expression often occur in prostate cancer. An adenoviral vector containing wild-type p16 (Adp16) had a high transduction efficiency in prostate-cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, prostate tumors injected with Adp16 expressed p16 and the adenoviral vector expressed the transgene for up to 14 days. Wild-type p16 inhibited prostate-cancer proliferation in vitro and markedly suppressed tumors in vivo. Pathologic evaluation of the Adp16-treated tumors showed dose-dependent necrosis and fibrosis. Although the mechanism of p16 inhibition in cancer remains to be elucidated, senescence and apoptosis may both be important; however, the data suggest that p16-induced growth inhibition can function independently of the retinoblastoma gene product.",

We used real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to assess both transcripts and proteins levels in 60 tumours specimens. Overexpression of p14ARF and pl6INK4A was observed in follicular adenomas, follicular carcinomas and papillary carcinomas, while downregulation was found in oncocytic adenomas compared to nontumoral paired thyroid tissues. These deregulations were statistically significant for pl6INK4a (P=0.006) in follicular adenomas and close to statistical significance for p14ARF in follicular adenomas (P=0.06) and in papillary carcinomas (P=0.05). In all histological types, except papillary carcinomas, we observed a statistically significant relationship between p14ARF and E2F1 (r=0.64 to 1, P<0.05).

Our preliminary findings on eight pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) suggested that the survival of patients carrying a homozygous p16 gene deletion was significantly inferior to that of those without a deletion. The present study on 48 patients tested the hypothesis that the clinical outcome for pediatric ALL patients is correlated with the presence or absence of the p16 gene. Overall, nine of 48 children (18.3%) carried a homozygous p16 deletion. Such deletions were significantly more common (P = .003) among T-ALL patients (five of eight, 62.5%) than among precursor-B-ALL patients (four of 40, 10.0%). Of nine patients exhibiting p16 deletions, eight (88.9%) were classified as high-risk patients by the recognized prognostic factors of age, white blood cell count, and T-cell phenotype. The 4-year event-free survival in the study population as a whole was 72.7%. Without adjustment for other risk factors (univariate model), the presence of a homozygous p16 deletion was associated with a markedly increased probability of both relapse (P = .0003) and death (P = .002). These findings raise the question of whether the p16 deletion itself confers an increased risk of relapse after adjusting for the known risk factors. In this analysis, the estimated risk multiplier factor for relapse in patients carrying the p16 deletion was 14.0 (P = .0004) and for the risk of death 15.6 (P = .0008). We therefore conclude that the presence of a homozygous p16 deletion may well be an important risk factor for both relapse and death in childhood ALL, and that its prognostic effect is not a consequence of confounding by other factors already known to influence outcome in this disease.",

It has been shown that the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins are able to inactivate the tumor suppressor functions of p53 and Rb. In cervical and head and neck cancers, HPV infection is also associated with an overexpression of p16, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The expression of these cell cycle regulators in squamous cell carcinomas of the anorectal region has not been well studied. In the current study, 29 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the anorectal region were immunohistochemically examined for the expression of p16, Rb, and p53 proteins. Tumor cell DNA was also extracted from paraffin blocks and subjected to broad-spectrum HPV DNA testing and typing. The results show that the tumor cells exhibited a strong and diffuse nuclear stain (with some cytoplasmic positivity) for p16 in all 29 cases (100%). The adjacent nonneoplastic squamous epithelium or colonic mucosa, in contrast, was completely negative. Loss of Rb nuclear staining in tumor cells was observed in 20 cases (69%). The p53 protein was essentially undetectable, with only 6 cases containing <10% positive cells. HPV DNA was detected in every case (100%), with 25 cases (86%) harboring Type 16. In addition, almost identical results were obtained in 12 HPV-positive squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. This was in marked contrast to those of HPV-negative tumors, where positive p16 staining and loss of Rb expression were seen in only 2/21 (10%) and 1/21 (5%) cases, respectively.

Primary and/or nodal metastatic tumors in all cases of OPSCC from 2010 to 2013 were typed by 1 of 3 head and neck pathologists as keratinizing, nonkeratinizing, nonkeratinizing with maturation, or another defined variant. All were assessed for p16 by immunohistochemistry with a 70% nuclear and cytoplasmic positivity cutoff as part of routine clinical practice. In addition, 70 consecutive cases from 1 year were \"audited\" for high-risk HPV mRNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. Of the 435 cases, the majority (90%) consisted of 1 of the 3 main types described and the rest (10%) of uncommon variants.

On univariate analysis, high c-Met expression predicted for worse LRC (hazard ratio [HR] 2.27; 95% CI, 1.08-4.77; P=.031), DM (HR 4.41; 95% CI, 1.56-12.45; P=.005), DFS (HR 3.00; 95% CI, 1.68-5.38; P<.001), and OS (HR 4.35; 95% CI, 2.13-8.88; P<.001). On multivariate analysis, after adjustment for site, T stage, smoking history, and EGFR status, only high c-Met expression (P=.011) and negative p16 status (P=.003) predicted for worse DFS. High c-Met expression was predictive of worse DFS in both EGFR-positive (P=.032) and -negative (P=.008) patients. In the p16-negative patients, those with high c-Met expression had worse DFS (P=.036) than did those with low c-Met expression. c-Met expression was not associated with any outcome in the p16-positive patients.;c-Met is expressed in the majority of locally advanced HNSCC cases, and high c-Met expression predicts for worse clinical outcomes.

The p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor accumulates in aging tissues, is a biomarker for cellular senescence, and limits stem cell function in vivo. While the activation of a p53-dependent DDR by dysfunctional telomeres has been well documented in human cells and mouse models, the role for p16(INK4a) in response to telomere dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we generated protection of telomeres 1b p16-/- mice (Pot1bΔ/Δ;p16-/-) to address the function of p16(INK4a) in the setting of telomere dysfunction in vivo. We found that deletion of p16(INK4a) accelerated organ impairment and observed functional defects in highly proliferative organs, including the hematopoietic system, small intestine, and testes. Pot1bΔ/Δ;p16-/- hematopoietic cells exhibited increased telomere loss, increased chromosomal fusions, and telomere replication defects. p16(INK4a) deletion enhanced the activation of the ATR-dependent DDR in Pot1bΔ/Δ hematopoietic cells, leading to p53 stabilization, increased p21-dependent cell cycle arrest, and elevated p53-dependent apoptosis. In contrast to p16(INK4a), deletion of p21 did not activate ATR, rescued proliferative defects in Pot1bΔ/Δ hematopoietic cells, and significantly increased organismal lifespan.

Having demonstrated previously that the homeodomain transcription factor Cdx2 increases markedly during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, we have examined its effects in beta-catenin signaling during transdifferentiation of Em Ca cells. In clinical cases, Cdx2 immunoreactivity, along with increased mRNA signals, was found to overlap with nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and p21(Waf1) in morules, demonstrating an inverse correlation with cell proliferation. In cell lines, over-expression of active form beta-catenin resulted in a significant increase in endogenous Cdx2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the Cdx2 promoter was activated by T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) -independent activated beta-catenin, as well as Cdx2 itself, through the region from -39 to +9 bp relative to transcription start site. Cells over-expressing exogenous Cdx2 showed high levels of p21(Waf1) expression due to stabilization of the mRNA status, resulting in significant decrease in the proliferation rate, in contrast to the lack of apparent changes in morphology. Moreover, transfected Cdx2 could inhibit beta-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcriptional activation of target genes, including p14(ARF) and cyclin D1, probably through indirect mechanisms. These data suggest that over-expression of Cdx2 mediated by nuclear beta-catenin and Cdx2 itself can cause an inhibition of Em Ca cell proliferation through up-regulation of p21(Waf1) expression, modulating beta-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcription. We therefore conclude that an association between Cdx2 and beta-catenin signaling may participate in induction of transdifferentiation of Em Ca cells.",

ARF facilitates growth arrest through the p53 pathway by hindering the down-regulation of p53 activity mediated by MDM2, through the formation of a protein complex with MDM2. Here we have explored the possibility that human p14(ARF) activity is integrated with growth regulating pathways other than p53, and report our results that p14(ARF) can control the activity of the E2F transcription factor. p14(ARF) regulates E2F activity in different cell-types, including p53(-/-)/mdm(-/-) MEFs, thus excluding that the effects of p14(ARF) are indirectly caused through MDM2 modulation. p14(ARF) down-regulates E2F-dependent transcription, and in cells undergoing E2F-dependent apoptosis prompts cell cycle arrest. p14(ARF) possesses multiple binding domains for E2F-1, one of which resides within the N-terminal region and coincides with the regulation of E2F activity. A mutational analysis of p14(ARF) indicates that the E2F-1 and MDM2 binding domains can be distinguished. These results highlight the potential interplay between p14(ARF) and E2F, and establish p14(ARF) as a pleiotrophic regulator of cell growth that acts by targetting at least two key pathways in the control of proliferation, namely E2F and p53.",

Based on values for 42 normal kidneys, we calculated expected nuclear p16(INK4A) expression for age and compared the observed values in diseased kidneys to those expected for age. In GD, p16(INK4A) expression was strikingly increased in glomerular and interstitial cell nuclei compared to normals and TIN, and could not be attributed to age (P<0.05). By multivariate analyses, GD was independently associated with increased nuclear p16(INK4a) expression in glomeruli (P<0.001) and interstitium (P=0.01). The p16(INK4A) expression in glomerular and interstitial cell nuclei, and tubular cytoplasm was higher in kidneys with proteinuria and with atrophy/fibrosis (P<0.05). Older age was associated with increased nuclear p16(INK4a) expression in tubules (P=0.01), and interstitial inflammation was associated with increased nuclear p16(INK4a) expression in interstitial cells (P=0.001). The p16(INK4a) staining in tubular cytoplasm was increased in both GD and TIN compared to normals (P<0.001), and was not related to age (P>0.05). Thus, kidneys with GD display increased expression of senescence marker p16(INK4A) in glomerular and interstitial cell nuclei compared to kidneys with normal aging or TIN. The findings suggest a role for somatic cell senescence mechanisms in progression of GD.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The immortalization process is a fundamental step in the development of most (if not all) human cancers, including the aggressive endothelial cell (EC)-derived malignancy angiosarcoma. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p16(INK4a) and the development of multiple chromosomal abnormalities are features of angiosarcoma that are recapitulated during telomerase-mediated immortalization of human ECs in vitro. The present study used a panel of telomerase-immortalized bone marrow EC (BMEC) lines to define the consequences of inactivation of p16(INK4a) on EC function and to identify molecular changes associated with repression of p16(INK4a). In a comparison of two immortalized BMEC mass cultures and six clones, the cell lines that repressed p16(INK4a) showed a higher rate of proliferation and an impaired ability to undergo morphogenic differentiation and form vessel-like structures in vitro. Proteomic comparison of a p16(INK4a)-negative and a p16(INK4a)-positive BMEC mass culture at early- and late-passage time points following transduction with telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) revealed altered expression of cytoskeletal proteins, including vimentin and α-tropomyosin (αTm), in the immortal cells. Immunoblot analyses of a panel of 11 immortal clones showed that cells that lacked p16(INK4a) expression tended to accumulate more dramatic changes in these cytoskeletal proteins than cells that retained p16(INK4a) expression. This corresponded with aberrant cytoskeletal architectures among p16(INK4a)-negative clones, which featured thicker actin stress fibers and less fluid membrane ruffles than p16(INK4a)-positive cells. A direct link between p16(INK4a) repression and defective EC function was confirmed by analysis of normal cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting p16(INK4a). siRNA-mediated repression of p16(INK4a) significantly impaired random motility and vessel formation in vitro. This report is the first to demonstrate that ECs that repress the expression of p16(INK4a) are prone to defects in motility, morphogenesis and cytoskeletal organization. These defects are likely to reflect alterations that occur during the development of EC-derived malignancies.",

High exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases rate of developing BCC, a slowly growing tumor that occurs in hair-growing squamous epithelium and rarely metastasizes. In genetic studies, BCC patients have cell-cycle abnormalities of different parts of the signaling pathway. Retinoblastoma regulatory pathway is important in cell cycle arrest. In this pathway, p16INK4a, an inhibitor of Rb pathway, binds to CDK4 and CDK6 competitively with cyclin D1 to prevent phosphorylation of tumor suppressor pRB gene.

In gallbladder carcinoma, cholecystolithiasis and pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) are major risk factors. Here, by using 113 surgically resected gallbladders and cultures of human gallbladder epithelial cells (HGECs) and gallbladder carcinoma cell line (TGBC2TKB), we examined carcinogenesis with respect to cellular senescence. Among 15 cases of PBM in which carcinoma was found in 4 cases, nonneoplastic gallbladder mucosa showed diffuse papillary hyperplasia (PHP). PHP was not found in gallbladders with cholecystolithiasis. Interestingly, PHP exhibited senescent features such as expression of p16(INK4A) and low cell proliferative activity. In contrast, EZH2, a polycomb group protein, was overexpressed in intraepithelial neoplasm and carcinoma in gallbladders with cholecystolithiasis. In PBM, EZH2 was expressed only in carcinoma foci but not in PHP. Cultured HGECs treated with lysolecithin, the level of which is elevated in gallbladder bile of PBM, showed increased expression of p16(INK4A) and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. Conversely, enforced overexpression of EZH2 in senescent HGECs reduced p16(INK4A) expression. A knockdown of EZH2 in cultured TGBC2TKB cells increased p16(INK4a) expression. In conclusion, PHP in PBM may act as a barrier to malignant transformation for decades. EZH2 may be responsible for the escape from cellular senescence followed by malignant transformation in the gallbladder of PBM.",

We analyzed mechanisms and consequences of p16(INK4A) reconstitution in T-ALL cells lacking this tumor suppressor. CCRF-CEM cells with tetracycline-regulated p16(INK4A) expression underwent stable G1-phase cell cycle arrest for 72 h followed by massive apoptosis. p16(INK4A) expression caused pRB hypophosphorylation and repression of certain E2F target genes. Interestingly, cyclin E and c-Myc were not affected, suggesting pRB/E2F-independent expression of these E2F targets. Cyclin E/CDK2, however, was inactive due to stabilization and redistribution of p27(Kip1) from CDK4/CDK6 to CDK2. Analyses of c-Myc target genes suggested that c-Myc was transcriptionally inactive, which correlated with hypophosphorylation of the c-Myc inhibitor p107. Thus, p16(INK4A), although unable to repress the expression of deregulated cyclin E and c-Myc, functionally inactivated these potential oncogenes. p16(INK4A)-arrested cells showed morphologic changes, induction of T-cell-specific surface markers and repression of telomerase activity, suggesting differentiation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinoma of the skin is the most common neoplasia in humans. Previous studies have shown the existence of allelic imbalance (loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability) in BCC on several human chromosomes. Chromosome region 9p21-p22 harbors the CDKN2a/p16INK4a, p19ARF, and p15INK4b tumor suppressor genes. To determine the contribution of these genes to the development of basal cell carcinomas we looked for evidence of allelic imbalance in 67 sporadic basal cell carcinoma specimens from Greek patients and screened 28 of them presenting loss of heterozygosity at 9p21-p22 for germline mutations in p16INK4a and p19ARF genes. Chromosome regions 17q21 and 17p13 were also screened for allelic imbalance in all the 67 basal cell carcinoma specimens. Overall, 69% (46 of 67) of the specimens displayed loss of heterozygosity in at least one microsatellite marker, whereas only six of the 67 (9%) exhibited microsatellite instability. For the 9p21-p22 locus the overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity reached 55% (37 of 67) and is the highest reported. The overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity for the 17q21 locus is 34% (22 of 64) and for the 17p13 locus is 11% (seven of 65). Two of the 28 loss of heterozygosity positive cases were heterozygous for a previously described polymorphism, Ala148Thr, in exon 2 of the CDKN2a gene. This is the first demonstration of polymorphism in the CDKN2a gene in human basal cell carcinomas. No sequence variation in exon 1beta of the p19ARF gene was found. Our results provide evidence of a significantly high occurrence of loss of heterozygosity for the 9p21-p22 locus; however, lack of p16INK4a/p19ARF mutation suggests that these genes seem not to be implicated by mutational inactivation in the development of basal cell carcinoma. Other(s), yet unidentified, tumor suppressor gene(s) located in this locus may be related to this specific type of skin cancer.",

Seven BTs (3 benign, 3 borderline/atypically proliferating, 1 malignant) and 7 TCCs were stained for WT1, ER, p53, and p16(INK4a).

P16 expression was associated with the presence of HPV-16: 31 of 38 HPV-positive tumors exhibited p16 expression, whereas only 9 of the 138 HPV-negative tumors were p16-positive (82% versus 6%, P < 0.00001). In the bilateral tonsil sections, hybridization signals were strictly limited to the invasive cancers and associated dysplasias. P16 staining was widely distributed throughout the nonneoplastic crypt epithelium of individuals with and without tonsillar cancer.;HPV-16 is strongly associated with carcinomas arising from the oropharynx, and integration is tightly coupled to the neoplastic process. Viral integration does not occur as a field alteration throughout normal tonsillar epithelium. P16 expression localizes to HPV-positive cancers, and is intrinsic to the specialized epithelium of the tonsillar crypts.

Once such a lesion has developed, progression toward an invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) may take one or more decades, underlining the heterogeneity of these lesions in terms of duration of existence and progression risk. We performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) on 46 p16(INK4a) immunopositive CIN2/3 lesions to determine whether this heterogeneity is reflected in their chromosomal profiles. Chromosomal profiles of CIN2/3 lesions were related to those of invasive cervical SCC and promoter methylation of CADM1, a tumor suppressor gene known to be functionally involved in the tumorigenic phenotype of cervical cancer cells. Frequent alterations found in CIN2/3 lesions included gains located at chromosome 1, 3, 7, and 20 and losses located at 4, 11, 16, 17, and 19. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified two subsets of CIN2/3 lesions, chromosomal profiles of one of which closely resembled invasive SCCs. Gains of 1, 3q, and 20 were characteristic for CIN2/3 lesions with chromosomal signatures resembling carcinomas. In addition, dense promoter methylation of the CADM1 gene was significantly more frequent in these CIN2/3 lesions (P = 0.004). No chromosomal alterations were detected in six CIN1 lesions, five of which were completely p16(INK4a) immunonegative. These findings suggest that biomarkers associated with gains at chromosomes 1, 3q, and 20 are potential hallmarks of advanced p16(INK4a)-positive CIN2/3 lesions with a high short-term risk of progression.",

In vitro, cell death was enhanced by combined gene transfer (63.82±15.30% sub-G0 cells); yet introduction of a single gene resulted in significantly fewer hypoploid cells (37.73±7.3% or 36.96±11.58%, p19Arf or IFNβ, respectively, P<0.05). Annexin V staining and caspase-3 cleavage indicate a cell death mechanism consistent with apoptosis. Using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR, we show that key transcriptional targets of p53 were upregulated in the presence of p19Arf, although treatment with IFNβ did not alter expression of the genes studied. In situ gene therapy revealed significant inhibition of subcutaneous tumors by IFNβ (571±25 mm3) or the combination of p19Arf and IFNβ (489±124 mm3) as compared with the LacZ control (1875±33 mm3, P<0.001), whereas p19Arf yielded an intermediate result (1053±169 mm3, P<0.01 vs control).

Therefore, predictive biomarkers for this disease would be valuable to provide more effective and individualized therapeutic approaches for these patients. While prognostic biomarkers such as p16 expression correlate with outcome; to date, no predictive biomarkers have been clinically validated for HNSCC. We generated xenografts in immunocompromised mice from six established HNSCC cell lines and evaluated response to cisplatin, cetuximab, and radiation. Tissue microarrays were constructed from pre- and posttreatment tumor samples derived from each xenograft experiment. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed using a semiautomated imaging and analysis platform to determine the relative expression of five potential predictive biomarkers: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phospho-EGFR, phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK, and excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1). Biomarker levels were compared between xenografts that were sensitive versus resistant to a specific therapy utilizing a two-sample t-test with equal standard deviations. Indeed the xenografts displayed heterogeneous responses to each treatment, and we linked a number of baseline biomarker levels to response. This included low ERCC1 being associated with cisplatin sensitivity, low phospho-Akt correlated with cetuximab sensitivity, and high total EGFR was related to radiation resistance. Overall, we developed a systematic approach to identifying predictive biomarkers and demonstrated several connections between biomarker levels and treatment response. Despite these promising initial results, this work requires additional preclinical validation, likely involving the use of patient-derived xenografts, prior to moving into the clinical realm for confirmation among patients with HNSCC.

In cancer patients, tumor suppressor p53 is frequently inactivated through mutations, whereas p16(INK4a) is silenced through promoter methylation. However, the interaction between these two pathways is less well understood. Here, we report that p53 controls p16(INK4a) expression in a unique way. p53 deficiency led to up-regulation of p16(INK4a) in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and various mouse organs, and an increase in the p16(INK4a) promoter activity, without affecting the half-life of p16(INK4a). Reconstitution of p53, but not mutant p53, restored the proper expression of p16(INK4a). These results indicate that p53 is necessary in repressing p16(INK4a) expression. However, up-regulation of p53 in response to genotoxic stress or nutlin-3 treatment did not down-regulate p16(INK4a). p53 did not repress the p16(INK4a) promoter activity either. These findings suggest that p53 has a necessary but not sufficient role in repressing p16(INK4a) expression. p16(INK4a) elevation in p53(-/-) cells is, at least partially, mediated by Ets1, a known positive regulator of p16(INK4a), as p53 deficiency up-regulated Ets1 through protein stabilization and knockdown of Ets1 down-regulated p16(INK4a) expression in p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These studies uncover a compensatory mechanism for the loss of p53 and provide a basis for targeting both p53 and p16(INK4a) in cancer therapy.",

However, it remains unclear which biomarker(s) can reliably determine which OPSCC specimens are truly driven by HPV infection. In this study, we analyzed 199 fresh-frozen OPSCC specimens for HPV DNA, viral load, RNA expression patterns typical for cervical carcinomas (CxCaRNA(+)), and the HPV-targeted tumor suppressor protein p16(INK4a) as markers for HPV infection. In this set of specimens, there was a 49% prevalence of DNA for the cancer-associated HPV type 16 (HPV(+)). However, there was only a 16% prevalence of high viral load and only a 20% prevalence of CxCaRNA(+), a marker of HPV16 carcinogenic activity. Among the CxCaRNA(+) tumors, 78% of the specimens exhibited overexpression of p16(INK4a), which also occurred in 14% of the HPV-negative tumors. Using a multivariate survival analysis with HPV negativity as the reference group, CxCaRNA(+) as a single marker conferred the lowest risk of death [HR = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.13-0.61] from oropharyngeal cancer, closely followed by high viral load (HR = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.14-0.73). In contrast, a weaker inverse association was found for OPSCC that were HPV(+) and p16(INK4a) high (HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.29-1.08). In summary, our findings argued that viral load or RNA pattern analysis is better suited than p16(INK4a) expression to identify HPV16-driven tumors in OPSCC patient populations.",

Patients who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. HPV 16/18 DNA was evaluated using Chromogenic in-situ Hybridization (CISH). Presence of nuclear signals was taken as positive HPV expression. p16 was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and was considered positive if ≥ 80% of the tumour cells showed strong and diffuse nuclear/cytoplasmic immunostaining. The results were analysed using Fisher exact test and confidence interval was calculated where required.;The study group age ranged from 30 to 80 years (median age- 54.2 years). The most common site was gum, with well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma being the most common histology. HPV 16/18 DNA was positive in 29% (95% CI: 13.03% - 44.97%) cases and had a clear tendency towards statistical significance with non-smoker cases (p=0.05), lymph node metastasis (p=0.05) and a significant correlation with p16 overexpression (p=0.04). There was no significant correlation with other clinico-pathological parameters.;HPV 16/18 is associated with OSCC, commonly seen among non-smokers and may be related to nodal metastasis.

Previously, we found that lack or reduced expression of p14(ARF) is involved in the maintenance of aneuploid cells in primary human cells, suggesting that it could be part of a pathway controlling their proliferation. To investigate this aspect further, p14(ARF) was ectopically expressed in HCT116 cells after depletion of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint MAD2 protein that was used as a trigger for aneuploidy. p14(ARF) Re-expression reduced the number of aneuploid cells in MAD2 post-transcriptionally silenced cells. Also aberrant mitoses, frequently displayed in MAD2-depleted cells, were decreased when p14(ARF) was expressed at the same time. In addition, p14(ARF) ectopic expression in MAD2-depleted cells induced apoptosis associated with increased p53 protein levels. Conversely, p14(ARF) ectopic expression did not induce apoptosis in HCT116 p53KO cells.

The various senescence signals are integrated by p16(INK4A) and p53 to produce the permanent cell cycle arrest associated with senescence. Both pRB/p16(INK4A) and p53 are dysfunctional in many cancers, including the most common type of oral cancer, squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and other evidence is accumulating in support of the idea that senescence acts as a barrier to tumour development and/or progression.

Recently, an alternatively spliced form of p15 has been cloned and termed p10 based on the presumed molecular weight of the protein. In this study, we have investigated the role of p10 expression in human glioblastomas. Both, wild-type p15 and p10 were detected in three of nine glioblastoma cell lines. Sixteen of twenty-nine (55%) glioblastoma tumor samples contained INK4b transcripts, but only nine (31%) tumors expressed p15 protein. Three p15 protein-negative tumors expressed only p10 mRNA. Preferential expression of p10 was not due to splice site mutations. Strong suppression of tumorigenicity was seen in four glioblastoma cell lines after transfection with p15 but not with p10. Loss of p15 protein expression was almost always accompanied by loss of p16 expression. p1 6/p15-negative tumors commonly lacked p14ARF expression. These results suggest that differential splicing of the INK4b gene may result in the expression of p10 at the expense of p15, which would lead to loss of p15-mediated growth suppression. This novel mechanism of loss of p15 might complement alterations of the INK4a tumor suppressor gene in some glioblastomas, resulting in combined loss of p16, p15 and p14ARF.",

Implicit was also the attempt to understand the role of E2F, as indicated by p16(INK4a), in evolution of SCC from HSIL. No ethnic predilection was noted for LSIL, HSIL or SCC. Patients with SCC were significantly older by about 14-years compared with HSIL (p < 0.05) while there was no significant age difference between HSIL and LSIL. p16(INK4a) expression was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in both HSIL (88.9%) and SCC (83.3%) compared with LSIL (3.4%) and NSqE (0%); the NSqE being normal squamous epithelium noted in 17 of the LSIL, 19 HSIL and 5 SCC. From these findings there is suggestion that fundamental upstream events viz HPV integration, E7 upregulation followed by E2F activation occurs at point of transformation to HSIL and continues unrelentingly for another one to two decades before hitherto unclear factors convert a non-invasive lesion into an overtly invasive malignant counterpart. Interestingly, the occurrence of HSIL and LSIL in almost the same age group could mean that alteration from episomal to integrated form of HPV may not incur a prolonged incubation period, unlike from HSIL to SCC.",

Re-expression of K-Ras in p16(INK4a) restituted Capan-1 cells reversed the anoikis-sensitive phenotype and increased colony formation, indicating that K-Ras suppression was required for p16(INK4a) -mediated reversion of the transformed phenotype. Inducible expression of p16(INK4a) in DanG cells confirmed inhibition of K-Ras activity as well as an increase in anoikis susceptibility.

K-ras gene mutations appear to be an infrequent event in this neoplasm, except in gallbladder carcinomas associated with congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract.

Senescence can be overcome if the pathway is not fully engaged, and this may occur when p16(INK4a) is inactivated. p16(INK4a) is frequently altered in human cancer and germline mutations affecting p16(INK4a) have been linked to melanoma susceptibility. To characterize the functions of melanoma-associated p16(INK4a) mutations, in terms of promoting proliferative arrest and initiating senescence, we utilized an inducible expression system in a melanoma cell model. We show that wild-type p16(INK4a) promotes rapid cell cycle arrest that leads to a senescence programme characterized by the appearance of chromatin foci, activation of acidic beta-galactosidase activity, p53 independence and Rb dependence. Accumulation of wild-type p16(INK4a) also promoted cell enlargement and extensive vacuolization independent of Rb status. In contrast, the highly penetrant p16(INK4a) variants, R24P and A36P failed to arrest cell proliferation and did not initiate senescence. We also show that overexpression of CDK4, or its homologue CDK6, but not the downstream kinase, CDK2, inhibited the ability of wild-type p16(INK4a) to promote cell cycle arrest and senescence. Our data provide the first evidence that p16(INK4a) can initiate a CDK4/6-dependent autonomous senescence programme that is disabled by inherited melanoma-associated mutations.",

Here, we show that p14(ARF) induces breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release before triggering caspase-9- and caspase-3/7-like activities in p53/Bax-deficient DU145 prostate cancer cells expressing wild-type Bak. Re-expression of Bax in these cells failed to further enhance p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis, suggesting that p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis primarily depends on Bak but not Bax in these cells. To further define the role of Bak and Bax in p14(ARF)-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, we employed short interference RNA for the knockdown of bak in isogeneic, p53 wild-type HCT116 colon cancer cells either proficient or deficient for Bax. There, combined loss of Bax and Bak attenuated p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis whereas single loss of Bax or Bak was only marginally effective, as in the case of DU145. Notably, HCT116 cells deficient for Bax and Bak failed to release cytochrome c and showed attenuated activation of caspase-9 (LEHDase) and caspase-3/caspase-7 (DEVDase) upon p14(ARF) expression. These data indicate that p14(ARF) triggers apoptosis via a Bax/Bak-dependent pathway in p53-proficient HCT116, whereas Bax is dispensable in p53-deficient DU145 cells. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of p14(ARF)-induced cell death proceeds in a Bax/Bak-independent manner. This is also the case for inhibition of clonogenic growth that occurs, at least in part, through an entirely Bax/Bak-independent mechanism.",

As a member of PcG proteins, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) targets cell cycle regulatory proteins which govern cell cycle progression and cellular senescence. In previous work, we reported that EZH2 depletion functionally induced cellular senescence in human gastric cancer cells with mutant p53. However, whether EZH2 expression contributes to the change of key cell cycle regulators and the mechanism involved are still unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of EZH2 depletion on alteration of histone methylation pattern. In gastric cancer cells, INK4/ARF locus was activated to certain extent in consequence of a decrease of H3K27me3 along it caused by EZH2 silence, which contributed substantially to an increase in the expression of p15(INK4b), p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) and resulted in cellular senescence ultimately. Furthermore, MKN28 cells, which did not express p16(INK4a) and p21(cip), could be induced to senescence via p15(INK4b) activation and suppression of p15(INK4b) reversed senescence progression induced by EZH2 downregulated. These data unravel a crucial role of EZH2 in the regulation of INK4/ARF expression and senescence procedure in gastric cancer cells, and show that the cellular senescence could just depend on the activation of p15(INK4b)/Rb pathway, suggesting the cell-type and species specificity involved in the mechanisms of senescence inducement.

Interestingly, spheres from both sarcomas remarkably decreased the expression of INK4a/ARF locus genes, p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF), which could be related to the resistance against cell senescence and apoptosis. Spheres showed strong tumorigenicity with metastatic potential in vivo via the inoculation into syngeneic rats, suggesting the presence of these populations might contribute to the tumor development such as metastasis via the resistance to apoptotic stimuli.",

Tumor DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks and subjected to HPV 16 and 18 testing. The association between HPV 16 and 18 E6 oncoprotein and cell cycle proteins expression in ovarian carcinomas also was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.;We demonstrated that a majority of moderately and poorly differentiated ovarian carcinomas are characterized by strong expression of p53 and p16(INK4a) proteins. In contrast, strong staining with cyclin D1 antibody was observed in well differentiated tumors. The correlation between strong p53, pRb, Cyclin D1 and clinical stages of disease was also observed. We show that patients with high positivity for p53, p16(INK4a) and Cyclin D1 had a poor prognosis and reduced overall survival. The presence of HPV 16/18 DNA was detected in 17% of ovarian carcinomas. The tumor tissues that reacted positively to HPV E6 antibody in focal and diffuse manners had also significantly low p53 expression profile.;These findings suggest that p53, p16(INK4a) and Cyclin D1 expression and HPV infection may represent a promising tool toward the identification of ovarian cancer patients with poorer prognosis and shorter survival who might therefore need a more aggressive therapy and HPV screening.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Previously we reported that TGF-β1-induced growth suppression was associated with a decrease in mutant p53 levels in B-cell lymphoma cells. The goal of the present study was to understand the mechanism involved in TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation of mutant p53. In RL and CA46, two B-cell lymphoma cell lines, TGF-β1 treatment caused down-regulation of E2F-1 transcription factor resulting in the down-regulation of both p14(ARF) and mutant p53, leading to growth arrest. Experimental overexpression of E2F-1 increased p14(ARF) level and blocked TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of p14(ARF). Overexpression of p14(ARF) blocked the down-regulation of mutant p53 and prevented growth arrest. p14(ARF) also attenuated TGF-β1-induced p21(Cip1/WAF1) induction, which was reversible by p53 siRNA, indicating the involvement of mutant p53 in controlling the TGF-β1-induced expression of p21(Cip1/WAF1). The interaction observed between phospho-Smad2 and mutant p53 in the nucleus could be the mechanism responsible for blocking the growth-suppressive effects of TGF-β1. In RL cells, p14(ARF) is present in a trimer consisting of mutant p53-Mdm2-p14(ARF) and in a dimer consisting of Mdm2-p14(ARF). Because it is known that Mdm2 can degrade p53, it is possible that, in its trimeric form, p14(ARF) is able to stabilize mutant p53 by inhibiting Mdm2. In its dimeric form, p14(ARF) may be sequestering Mdm2, limiting its ability to degrade p53. Collectively, these data demonstrate a unique mechanism in which the inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression by mutant p53 can be reversed by the down-regulation of its stabilizing protein p14(ARF). This work suggests that the high levels of p14(ARF) often found in tumor cells could be a potential therapeutic target.",

We reported that antigen-stimulated CD8 T cells transduced to express an active form of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5CA) maintained these properties upon adoptive transfer. We now report on the requirements of STAT5CA-expressing CD8 T cells for cell survival and proliferation in vivo. We show that STAT5CA expression allows for greater expansion of T cells in vivo, while preserving dependency on T-cell-receptor-mediated tonic stimulation for their in vivo maintenance and return to a quiescent stage. STAT5CA expression promotes the formation of a large pool of effector memory T cells that respond upon re-exposure to antigen and present an increased sensitivity to γc receptor cytokine engagement for STAT5 phosphorylation. In addition, STAT5CA expression prolongs the survival of what would otherwise be short-lived terminally differentiated KLRG1-positive effector cells with up-regulated expression of the senescence-associated p16(INK) (4A) transcripts. However, development of a KLRG1-positive CD8 T cell population was independent of either p16(INK) (4A) or p19(ARF) expression (as shown using T cells from CDKN2A(-/-) mice) but was associated with expression of transcripts encoding p15(INK) (4B) , another protein involved in senescence induction. We conclude that T-cell-receptor- and cytokine-dependent regulation of effector T cell homeostasis, as well as mechanisms leading to senescent features of a population of CD8 T cells are maintained in STAT5CA-expressing CD8 T cells, even for cells that are genetically deficient in expression of the tumour suppressors p16(INK) (4A) and p19(ARF) .

The purpose of this study was to determine whether CDK activity directly modulates the production of inflammatory molecules in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).;Genes for the CDKIs p16(INK4a) and p18(INK4c), a constitutively active form of retinoblastoma (RB) gene product, cyclin D1, and CDK-4, were transferred into RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). RASFs were also treated with a synthetic CDK-4/6 inhibitor (CDK4I). Levels of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and IL-1RI expression were determined by Northern blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CDKIs were immunoprecipitated to reveal their association with JNK.;Transfer of the p16(INK4a) and p18(INK4c) genes and CDK4I suppressed the production of MMP-3 and MCP-1. Unlike p21(Cip1), neither CDKI gene inhibited IL-1RI or JNK. The expression of MMP-3 was up-regulated when CDK-4 activity was augmented. This regulation functioned at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level in MMP-3, but not in MCP-1. Transfer of active RB suppressed the production of MMP-3 and MCP-1 without changing their mRNA levels.;CDK-4/6 modulated the production of MMP-3 and MCP-1. MMP-3 production was regulated primarily at the mRNA level in an RB-independent manner, whereas MCP-1 production was controlled posttranscriptionally by RB. These results show that cell cycle proteins are associated with control of mediators of inflammation through multiple pathways.",

Mechanistically, we identify p19(ARF) as a direct Stat3 target. Loss of Stat3 signalling disrupts the ARF-Mdm2-p53 tumour suppressor axis bypassing senescence. Strikingly, we also identify STAT3 and CDKN2A mutations in primary human PCa. STAT3 and CDKN2A deletions co-occurred with high frequency in PCa metastases. In accordance, loss of STAT3 and p14(ARF) expression in patient tumours correlates with increased risk of disease recurrence and metastatic PCa. Thus, STAT3 and ARF may be prognostic markers to stratify high from low risk PCa patients. Our findings challenge the current discussion on therapeutic benefit or risk of IL-6/STAT3 inhibition. ",

P19 comprises ten alpha-helices arranged sequentially in five ankyrin repeats forming an elongated structure. This rather simple topology, combined with its physiological function, makes p19 an interesting model protein for folding studies. Urea-induced unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD and phenylalanine fluorescence coincide and suggest a two-state mechanism for equilibrium unfolding. Unfolding of p19 followed by 2D (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra revealed a third species at moderate urea concentrations with a maximum population of about 30 % near 3.2 M urea. It shows poor chemical shift dispersion, but cross-peaks emerge for some residues that are distinct from the native or unfolded state. This equilibrium intermediate either arises only at high protein concentrations (as in the NMR experiment) or has similar optical properties to the unfolded state. Stopped-flow far-UV CD experiments at various urea concentrations revealed that alpha-helical structure is formed in three phases, of which only the fastest phase (10 s(-1)) depends upon the urea concentration. The kinetic of the slowest phase (0.017 s(-1)) can be resolved by 1D real-time NMR and accelerated by cyclophilin. It is limited in rate by prolyl isomerization, and native-like ordered structure cannot form prior to this isomerization. The two fast phases lead to 83 % native protein within the dead time of the NMR experiment. In contrast to p16(INK4a), which exhibits only a marginal stability and high unfolding rates, p19 shows the expected stability for a protein of this size with a clear kinetic barrier between the unfolded and folded state. Therefore, p19 might complement the function of less stable INK4 inhibitors in cell cycle control under unfavorable conditions.",

Here, we studied the prognostic impact of the most prevalent connexin isotype, connexin 43 (Cx43) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Tissue microarrays made from tumor samples of 90 HNSCC patients were immunostained for Cx43 and cell cycle regulation-related biomarkers including p53, Ki67, p16, aurora A, geminin, and p21 proteins.

Cervical cancers arise through disruption of the pathways of p53 and the product of the retinoblastoma gene by the human papillomavirus oncoproteins E6 and E7. It is generally assumed that the same pathways are involved in human papillomavirus-induced carcinogenesis at other mucosal surfaces. However, the patterns of expression of cell cycle proteins targeted by human papillomavirus E6 and E7 in cancers from different anatomic sites have been inconsistent, due to either biologic or technological factors. In this study, 73 human papillomavirus, 16-positive cervical squamous cell carcinomas (35 from Australian and 38 from Chinese women) were analysed for the expression of p53, pRb, p16(INK4A), p21(CIP1/WAF1), p27(KIP1) and cyclin D1 by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry.

When the tonsillar data were compared with cervical data from Australian women, the associations for p53 and pRb remained.

We performed immunohistochemical analysis of p16(INK4a) and pRb expression and correlated with survival in a series of 300 patients with FIGO stage IIb-IV ovarian carcinoma which were enrolled in a randomized prospective trial evaluating two different platinum and paxlitaxel chemotherapy combinations after radical surgery. p16(INK4a) negative tumours (17/300; 6%) had a significantly worse prognosis (univariate analysis, P<0.001; multivariate analysis: odds ratio 2.41, P=0.009). Among p16(INK4a)-positive tumours (283 out of 300; 94%), survival was better for patients with intermediate expression as compared to low or high expression levels (P=0.001). High expression levels of pRb were associated with an incremental deterioration of prognosis (univariate analysis, P=0.004; multivariate analysis: odds ratio 2.98, P=0.002). This observation held also true in the subgroup of optimally debulked patients (n=82), in whom the most important established prognostic factor, postoperative residual tumour cannot be applied. In conclusion p16(INK4a) and pRb are independent prognostic factors in advanced-stage ovarian carcinomas after radical surgery and postoperative chemotherapy. High pRb expression is a significant prognosticator in optimally debulked patients and may hold potential for subgroup stratification in postoperative treatment.",

The nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 gene (Nrf2) is known to regulate the expression of detoxifying and antioxidant genes. We investigated the relationship between promoter polymorphisms of Nrf2 gene and the CpG island methylation in non-cancerous gastric mucosa. The study was performed in 85 subjects (46 without gastric malignancies, non-GC group, and 39 with gastric cancer, GC group). The promoter methylation status of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a) and p21(Waf1) genes was determined by methylation-specific-polymerase chain reaction. The Nrf2 gene genotypes were determined by the PCR-SSCP method. In the 85 subjects, CpG island methylation was found in 25.9% for p14, 15.3% for p16, none for p21. The frequency of the methylated genes was significantly higher in GC group than non-GC group (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.10-6.49; p=0.029). In particular, the frequency of p16 gene methylation was much higher in GC group (p=0.0023). The Nrf2 -686/-684 G/G haplotype was positively associated and A/G haplotype was inversely associated with the development of CpG island methylation, especially p14 gene methylation (OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.26-8.59; p=0.015, and OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15-0.96; p=0.040, respectively). In Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infected subjects, the number of -686/-684 G/G allele was positively correlated and that of A/G allele was inversely correlated to the methylation status, especially p14 methylation, by the adjusted analysis (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.14-7.36; p=0.026, and OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.88; p=0.027, respectively).

Introduction of mutant p53 did not affect MG132-mediated p14(ARF) protein stabilization. We found that phorbol ester TPA (12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate) stabilized p14(ARF) protein and that p53 status had no effect on TPA-mediated stabilization. TPA-mediated stabilization was abolished by staurosporine but not by lovastatin or U0126. We further investigated which isoforms of PKC were involved in TPA-mediated p14(ARF) stabilization using short-interference RNA. Knockdown of PKCalpha, but not PKCdelta, attenuated TPA-mediated p14(ARF) stabilization. These findings suggest that PKCalpha is involved in TPA-mediated stabilization of p14(ARF) protein, and this effect of TPA was not affected by the Ras/MAPK pathway or p53 status.

Here, by using somatic, tissue-specific inactivation of the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor in murine T- or B-lymphoid progenitors, we report that ablation of p16(INK4a) can either rescue aging or promote cancer in a lineage-specific manner. Deletion of p16(INK4a) in the T lineage ameliorated several aging phenotypes, including thymic involution, decreased production of naive T cells, reduction in homeostatic T-cell proliferation, and attenuation of antigen-specific immune responses. Increased T-cell neoplasia was not observed with somatic p16(INK4a) inactivation in T cells. In contrast, B lineage-specific ablation of p16(INK4a) was associated with a markedly increased incidence of systemic, high-grade B-cell neoplasms, which limited studies of the effects of somatic p16(INK4a) ablation on B-cell aging. Together, these data show that expression of p16(INK4a) can promote aging and prevent cancer in related lymphoid progeny of a common stem cell.",

Reintroduction of p19(ARF) restores p53 accumulation and resensitizes ARF-null cells to apoptotic signals. Therefore, p19(ARF) functions as part of a p53-dependent failsafe mechanism to counter uncontrolled proliferation.

Researches are focused on the development of HPV detection assays specially designed for HNSCC. The HPV diagnosis in these tumours is relevant toprognosis even in an already-developed tumour, whereas in the cervix, where the HPV is the cause of almost all tumours, this information has less clinical relevance. The better outcome of HPV-associated HNSCC raises the question about the best methodologies to distinguish between HPV and non-HPV-associated SCC. However, no consensus has been reached on the optimal way to identify HPV-associated SCC and ancillary studies have utilised many different methodologies, including HPV polymerase chain reaction testing, HPV in situ hybridization analysis, immunohistochemical staining for p16, and newer techniques that are currently under investigation. The objective of this review is to explain and give examples of various techniques of HPV detection highlighting how they might be used clinically. Although currently insufficiently specific due to the possibility of HPV infection originating at other sites, methodologies utilising serum and plasma to measure HPV infection will also be described, mostly for their potential future development and use. Finally, DNA/RNA microarray platforms will be briefly summarized for their capacity to identify the profile of molecular changes in any particular HPV+/HPV- cancer. In this way, it is expected to be possible to correlate the appropriate transcriptome-based diagnosis to the patients' specific cancer risk.",

These genes are designated as candidate tumor suppressor genes because they encode proteins that function as negative cell cycle regulators. (The encoded polypeptides inactivate specific cyclin-protein kinase complexes that are required for progression through the cell cycle.) Molecular genetic studies have revealed that deletion of the p16 and p15 genes occurs frequently in cancer cell lines and in certain malignant neoplasms.;We evaluated the frequency of p16 and p15 gene alterations in a well-characterized cohort of human transitional cell bladder cancers, and we explored potential associations between alterations in these genes and tumor stage and/or grade.;Tumor tissue and normal tissue from 110 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder were examined. The status of the p16 and p15 genes in these tissues was determined by Southern blotting and hybridization with gene-specific probes, by coupled polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP), and by sequencing DNA fragments produced during PCR. Associations between alterations in the genes and tumor stage and/or grade were evaluated using the two-tailed Fisher's exact test.;Homozygous deletion (both alleles lost) of the p16 and the p15 genes was observed in 11 and nine bladder tumors, respectively. Eight of the 11 tumors exhibiting complete loss of the p16 gene also displayed homozygous deletion of the p15 gene. Exclusive loss of either gene was detected in only three tumors. Hemizygous deletion (one allele lost, also referred to as loss of heterozygosity [LOH] of the p16 and/or p15 genes was observed in eight tumors. Rearrangement of the two genes was indicated in three additional tumors. No point mutations were identified in either gene. The overall frequency of alteration in this cohort of bladder tumors was approximately 18% for each gene (in 20 [18.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.1%-25.6%] of 109 informative tumors for the p16 gene and in 18 [18%, 95% CI = 10.5%-25.5%] of 100 informative tumors for the p15 gene). A statistically significant association between p16 gene alteration and bladder tumors of low stage (P < .01) and grade (P < .01) was observed; a significant association between p15 gene alteration and tumors of low stage (P < .01) was also detected.;Alteration of the p16 and p15 genes, especially coincident homozygous deletion, appears to be a common event in bladder cancer.",

Cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) is the key mediator for stress and aberrant signaling induced senescence. Here we report that elevated blood pressure markedly induced p16(INK4a) expression in rat kidneys and hearts, as well as in human kidneys. In kidneys from deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-treated rats, p16(INK4a) induction was found in tubular, glomerular, interstitial, and vascular cells and correlated with the typical histopathologic features of hypertensive target organ damage. p16(INK4a) expression also correlated with phospho-p38, a positive upstream regulator of p16(INK4a) expression. In left ventricles, increased p16(INK4a) expression was found in myocardium and cardiac arteries. Antihypertensive medication consistent of hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, and reserpine ameliorated the histopathologic changes and attenuated p16(INK4a) expression in kidneys of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-treated rats. Nonantihypertensive administration of spironolactone also reduced kidney damage and p16(INK4a) expression. p16(INK4a) induction was further observed in kidneys from hypertensive transgenic rats heterozygous for the mouse Ren-2 gene and was prevented by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan. In human kidney biopsies showing hypertensive nephrosclerosis, increased p16(INK4a) expression was found compared with age-matched normotensive control subjects. Thus, hypertension induces cellular senescence via p16(INK4a), possibly through p38, thereby contributing to hypertensive target organ damage. This detrimental effect can be overcome by different therapeutic drug strategies.",

Inactivation of the CDKN2A locus, which houses the ARF and p16(INK4a) tumour suppressor genes, is a common event in haemangiosarcoma patients, but the precise role of ARF in vascular tumourigenesis is unknown. To determine the extent to which ARF suppresses vascular neoplasia, we examined the incidence of hepatic vascular lesions in Arf-deficient mice exposed to the carcinogen urethane [intraperitoneal (i.p.), 1 mg/g]. Loss of Arf resulted in elevated morbidity and increased the incidence of both haemangiomas and incipient haemangiosarcomas. Suppression of vascular lesion development by ARF was heavily dependent on both Arf gene-dosage and the genetic strain of the mouse. Trp53-deficient mice also developed hepatic vascular lesions after exposure to urethane, suggesting that ARF signals through a p53-dependent pathway to inhibit the development of hepatic haemangiosarcoma. Our findings provide strong evidence that inactivation of Arf is a causative event in vascular neoplasia and suggest that the ARF pathway may be a novel molecular target for therapeutic intervention in haemangiosarcoma patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ZBTB7A (Pokemon) is a member of the POK family of transcriptional repressors. Its main function is the suppression of the p14ARF tumour suppressor gene. Although ZBTB7A expression has been found to be increased in various types of lymphoma, there are no reports dealing with its expression in solid tumours. Given that p14(ARF) inhibits MDM2, the main negative regulator of p53, we hypothesized that overexpression of ZBTB7A could lead indirectly to p53 inactivation. To this end, we examined the status of ZBTB7A and its relationship with tumour kinetics (proliferation and apoptosis) and nodal members of the p53 network in a panel of 83 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We observed, in the majority of the samples, prominent expression of ZBTB7A in the cancerous areas compared to negligible presence in the adjacent normal tissue elements. Gene amplification (two- to five-fold) was found in 27.7% of the cases, denoting its significance as a mechanism driving ZBTB7A overproduction in NSCLCs. In the remaining non-amplified group of carcinomas, analysis of the mRNA and protein expression patterns suggested that deregulation at the transcriptional and post-translational level accounts for ZBTB7A overexpression. Proliferation was associated with ZBTB7A expression (p = 0.033) but not apoptosis. The association with proliferation was reflected in the positive correlation between ZBTB7A expression and tumour size (p = 0.018). The overexpression of ZBTB7A in both p53 mutant and p53 wild-type cases, implies either a synergistic effect or that ZBTB7A exerts its oncogenic properties independently of the p14(ARF)-MDM2-p53 axis. The concomitant expression of ZBTB7A with p14(ARF) (p = 0.039), instead of the anticipated inverse relation, supports the latter notion. In conclusion, regardless of the pathway followed, the distinct expression of ZBTB7A in cancerous areas and the association with proliferation and tumour size pinpoints a role for this novel cell cycle regulator in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.",

Immunoexpression of p16(Ink4a) following exposure to other hepatocarcinogens/promoters and its DNA methylation status were also analyzed during early and late tumor-promotion stages. GST-P(+) liver cell foci increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis when compared with surrounding liver cells. In concordance with GST-P(+) foci, checkpoint proteins at G(1)/S (p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1) and p16(Ink4a)) and G(2)/M (phospho-checkpoint kinase 1, Cdc25c and phospho-Wee1) were either up- or downregulated. Cellular distribution within GST-P(+) foci was either increased or decreased with proteins related to G(2)-M phase or DNA damage (topoisomerase IIα, phospho-histone H2AX, phospho-histone H3 and Cdc2). In particular, p16(Ink4a) typically downregulated in GST-P(+) foci and regenerative nodules at early tumor-promotion stage with hepatocarcinogens facilitating liver cell regeneration and in neoplastic lesions at late tumor-promotion stage with hepatocarcinogens/promoters irrespective of regenerating potential. Hypermethylation at exon 2 of Cdkn2a was detected at both early- and late-stages. Thus, diverse disruptive expression of G(1)/S and G(2)/M proteins, which allows for clonal selection of GST-P(+) foci, results in the acquisition of multiple aberrant phenotypes to disrupt checkpoint function. Moreover, increased DNA-damage responses within GST-P(+) foci may be the signature of genetic alterations. Intraexonic hypermethylation may be responsible for p16(Ink4a)-downregulation, which facilitates cell cycle progression in early preneoplastic lesions produced by repeated cell regeneration and late-stage neoplastic lesions irrespective of the carcinogenic mechanism.",

Loss of p16 activity by either gene deletion, mutation or transcriptional inactivation has now been found in a wide range of human cancers of both epithelial and mesenchymal origin, at a frequency rivalling that of p53 mutation. As a first step towards investigating its possible role as a tumour suppressor gene in thyroid tumorigenesis, we have carried out a Southern blot analysis of the p16 gene locus in a series of cell lines derived from differentiated human thyroid cancers. Homozygous deletion of the entire p16 coding sequence was observed in two of three follicular and two of four papillary cancer cell lines, but not in normal tissue or normal cells immortalised by SV40 T antigen. Given the co-existence of p16 abnormalities in primary tumours and cell lines observed in other tumour types, this high frequency of deletion suggests that p16 is a key tumour suppressor gene in the genesis of differentiated thyroid cancer.",

Overexpression of Bmi1 has been described in medulloblastoma, highly aggressive brain neoplasms of childhood, which are thought to originate from deregulated proliferation of granule cell precursors. Here, we dissected the molecular mechanisms mediating the role of Bmi1 in granule cell development by means of transcriptome analysis in loss of function mouse models in vitro and in vivo.

In some patients with sporadic melanoma, one or more additional primary lesions develop, suggesting that some of these patients have an underlying genetic susceptibility to the cancer. We hypothesized that this predisposition might be due to germ-line CDKN2A mutations.;We used the polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct DNA sequencing to identify germ-line mutations in the CDKN2A gene in patients with multiple primary melanomas who did not have family histories of the disease. A quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the functional importance of the CDKN2A variants.;Of 33 patients with multiple primary melanomas, 5 (15 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 percent to 27 percent) had germ-line CDKN2A mutations. These included a 24-bp insertion at the 5' end of the coding sequence, three missense mutations (Arg24Pro, Met53Ile, and Ser56Ile), and a 2-bp deletion at position 307 to 308 (resulting in a truncated CDKN2A protein). In three families, CDKN2A mutations identical to those in the probands were found in other family members. In two families with mutations, we uncovered previously unknown evidence of family histories of melanoma.;Some patients with multiple primary melanomas but without family histories of the disease have germ-line mutations of the CDKN2A gene.

In this study, we show that the protooncoprotein Myc and the tumor suppressor p19(ARF) regulate both NSC self-renewal and their neuronal and glial fate in a developmental stage-dependent manner. Early-stage NSCs have low p19(ARF) expression and retain a high self-renewal and neurogenic capacity, whereas late-stage NSCs with higher p19(ARF) expression possess a lower self-renewal capacity and predominantly generate glia. Overexpression of Myc or inactivation of p19(ARF) reverts the properties of late-stage NSCs to those of early-stage cells. Conversely, inactivation of Myc or forced p19(ARF) expression attenuates self-renewal and induces precocious gliogenesis through modulation of the responsiveness to gliogenic signals. These actions of p19(ARF) in NSCs are mainly mediated by p53. We propose that opposing actions of Myc and the p19(ARF)-p53 pathway have important functions in coordinated developmental control of self-renewal and cell fate choices in NSCs.",

Here we analyzed the patterns of p16(INK4a) and Id1 expression during the lifespan of 2BS cells and presented the inverse correlation between these two proteins. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the presence of endogenous interaction of Id1 and E47 proteins that was strong in young 2BS cells and weakened during replicative senescence and, thereby, influenced the transcription activation of p16(INK4a) by E47. Furthermore, we found that E47 protein could bind to the E-box-containing region in p16(INK4a) promoter in senescent cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, suggesting that E47 is indeed ultimately involved in the regulation of p16(INK4a) transcription in vivo. Silencing Id1 expression in young cells by RNA interference induced an increased p16(INK4a) level and premature cellular senescence, whereas silencing E47 expression inhibited the expression of p16(INK4a) and delayed the onset of senescent phenotype.

A recent study from our laboratory showed that expression of the gene encoding p19(INK4D) is induced by the hormonal form of vitamin D(3) and by retinoids, both of which signal through related nuclear receptor transcription factors. Although vitamin D(3) and retinoids have distinct developmental and physiological functions, both regulate the cell cycle and have been shown to have chemopreventive effects in a range of studies. Induction of p19(INK4D) expression contributed to cell cycle arrest by both ligands. However, knockdown of p19(INK4D) rendered cells sensitive to autophagic cell death, a remarkable phenotype given the hyperproliferative responses to loss of other INK4 proteins.

In turn, endogenous p19(Arf) and Senp3 are both destabilized in viable Npm-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (that also lack p53), and reintroduction of the human NPM protein into these cells reverses this phenotype. NPM mutants that retain their acidic and oligomerization domains can re-stabilize both p19(Arf) and Senp3 in this setting, but the nucleolar localization of NPM is not strictly required for these effects. Knockdown of Senp3 with shRNAs mimics the antiproliferative functions of p19(Arf) in cells that lack p53 alone or in triple knock-out cells that lack the Arf, Mdm2 and p53 genes. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that the p53-independent tumor suppressive functions of p19(Arf) may be mediated by its ability to antagonize Senp3, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest by abnormally elevating the cellular levels of SUMOylated proteins.",

Methylation of MINT1, MINT31, hMLH1, p14ARF, and p16INK4a in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens was evaluated by combined bisulfite restriction analysis, and methylation of MINT2 was studied by methylation-specific PCR.;Methylation frequencies were 21% for MINT1, 23% for MINT2, 24% for MINT31, 4% for hMLH1, 11% for p14ARF, and 17% for p16INK4a. Methylation of MINT1, MINT31, p14ARF, and p16INK4a were correlated, as expected. There was no association between methylation and clinicopathologic factors or response to therapy.

Although the contribution of p16INK4a to human tumorigenesis through point mutation, deletion, and hypermethylation has been widely documented, little is known about specific p14ARF lesions and their consequences. Recent data indicate that p14ARF suffers inactivation by promoter hypermethylation in colorectal cancer cells. Because it is known that p14ARF prevents MDM2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and thus stabilizes p53 by attenuating MDM2-mediated degradation, we studied the relationship of p14ARF epigenetic silencing to the expression and localization of MDM2 and p53. Cancer cell lines with an unmethylated p14ARF promoter showed strong nuclear expression of MDM2, whereas in a colorectal cell line with p14ARF hypermethylation-associated inactivation, MDM2 protein was also seen in the cytosol. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was able to reinternalize MDM2 to the nucleus, and p53 expression was restored. No apparent changes in retinoblastoma localization were observed. We also studied the profile of p14ARF promoter hypermethylation in an extensive collection of 559 human primary tumors of different cell types, observing that in colorectal, gastric, renal, esophageal, and endometrial neoplasms and gliomas, aberrant methylation of p14ARF was a relatively common epigenetic event. MDM2 expression patterns revealed that lack of p14ARF promoter hypermethylation was associated with tumors showing exclusive nuclear MDM2 staining, whereas MDM2 cytosolic staining was frequently observed in neoplasms with aberrant p14ARF methylation. Taken together, these data support that epigenetic silencing of p14ARF by promoter hypermethylation is a key mechanism in the disturbance of the MDM2 nuclear localization in human cancer.",

Accordingly, p19(Arf)-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) arrest in response to acute DNA damage. However, p19(Arf) is required for replicative senescence, a condition associated with an activated DNA damage response, as p19(Arf)-/- MEFs do not senesce after serial passage. A possible explanation for these seemingly disparate roles for p19(Arf) is that acute and chronic DNA damage responses are mechanistically distinct. Replicative senescence may result from chronic, low-dose DNA damage responses in which p19(Arf) has a specific role. We therefore examined the role of p19(Arf) in cellular responses to chronic, low-dose DNA-damaging agent treatment by maintaining MEFs in low oxygen and administering 0.5 G y γ-irradiation daily or 150 μM hydroxyurea, a replication stress inducer. In contrast to their response to acute DNA damage, p19(Arf)-/- MEFs exposed to chronic DNA damage do not senesce, revealing a selective role for p19(Arf) in senescence upon low-level, chronic DNA damage. We show further that p53 pathway activation in p19(Arf)-/- MEFs exposed to chronic DNA damage is attenuated relative to wild-type MEFs, suggesting a role for p19(Arf) in fine-tuning p53 activity. However, combined Nutlin3a and chronic DNA-damaging agent treatment is insufficient to promote senescence in p19(Arf)-/- MEFs, suggesting that the role of p19(Arf) in the chronic DNA damage response may be partially p53-independent. These data suggest the importance of p19(Arf) for the cellular response to the low-level DNA damage incurred in culture or upon oncogene expression, providing new insight into how p19(Arf) serves as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, our study helps reconcile reports suggesting crucial roles for both p19(Arf) and DNA damage-signaling pathways in tumor suppression. ",

Therefore, the CDK4I gene is thought to be a putative tumor-suppressor gene. We report here that both alleles of the CDK4I gene were completely or partially deleted in human leukemia cells derived from both patients and established cell lines. Thirty-seven hematopoietic cell lines and samples from 72 patients with leukemias were examined for homozygous loss of the CDK4I gene locus by Southern blot analysis. We found that a part or the whole of the CDK4I gene was homozygously deleted in 14 of the 37 (38%) cell lines and 4 of 72 (6%) samples from leukemia patients, including 45 with acute myelocytic leukemia, 14 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 13 with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis. In the cell lines, the homozygous deletion of the CDK4I gene was detected in a variety of cell lineages, whereas all 4 cases showing the homozygous deletion were confined to ALL.

Although much is known about the function of p14(ARF) in the p53 pathway, not as much is known about its function in human tumor growth and chemosensitivity independently of up-regulation of p53 protein levels. To learn more about its effect on cellular proliferation and chemoresistance independent of p53 up-regulation, human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells null for p14(ARF) and harboring a defective p53 pathway were stably transfected with p14(ARF) cDNA under the tight control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Induction of p14(ARF) caused a decrease in cell proliferation rate and colony formation and a marked decrease in the level of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein. The effect of p14(ARF) on DHFR protein levels was specific, because thymidylate kinase and thymidylate synthase protein levels were not decreased nor were p53 or p21WAF1 protein levels increased. The decrease in DHFR protein was abolished when the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, demonstrating that p14(ARF) augments proteasomal degradation of the protein. Surprisingly, induction of p14(ARF) increased resistance to the folate antagonists methotrexate, trimetrexate, and raltitrexed. Depletion of thymidine in the medium reversed this resistance, indicating that p14(ARF) induction increases the reliance of these cells on thymidine salvage.",

In detecting such cases, most reported studies have used techniques that are less sensitive than DNA amplification. Recent reports have suggested that overexpression of the p16INK4 protein is a surrogate marker of HPV-induced high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma. However, the correlation between expression of p16INK4 and the presence of HPV DNA as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification has not been previously reported. The purpose of this research was to determine if immunohistochemistry for p16 would serve as a marker of HPV-associated high-grade oral squamous dysplasia.;Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 41 cases of high-grade oral squamous dysplasia were randomly selected. Expression of p16INK4 protein was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis (16P04 Neomarkers, Fremont, CA). Strong and diffuse nuclear staining restricted to the dysplastic region in the epithelium was scored as positive for protein expression, whereas focal or weak nuclear or cytoplasmic staining was scored as negative. The presence of HPV was determined by microdissection, DNA extraction, and PCR DNA amplification using elongated primers that align with corresponding sequences of the L1 region of 23 mucosotropic HPV genotypes. The HPV type was determined by direct sequencing of the PCR product. Normal squamous epithelium was used as an internal negative control, and cases of severe cervical high-grade squamous dysplasia were used as a positive control for immunohistochemical staining and PCR.;The results of immunohistochemical analysis for overexpression of p16INK4 were positive in 6 of the 41 tissue sections. The results of PCR DNA amplification were also positive for these 6 sections. HPV-16 was identified in 5 of the positive cases; in the other case, the viral strain could not be determined.;Immunohistochemical detection of p16INK4 is a technically simple and potentially reliable assay for diagnosing cases of HPV-induced oral high-grade squamous dysplasia.

        "Doc_abstract":"HBP1 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor with many important biological roles. It activates or represses the expression of some specific genes during cell growth and differentiation. Previous studies have exhibited that HBP1 binds to p16(INK4A) promoter and activates p16(INK4A) expression. We found that trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC (histone deacetylase), induces p16(INK4A) expression in an HBP1-dependent manner. This result was drawn from a transactivation experiment by measuring relative luciferase activities of p16(INK4A) promoter with HBP1-binding site in comparison with that of the wild-type p16(INK4A) promoter by transient cotransfection with HBP1 into HEK293T cells and 2BS cells. HBP1 acetylation after TSA treatment was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay. Our data showed that HBP1 interacted with histone acetyltransferase p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) and also recruited p300/CBP to p16(INK4A) promoter. HBP1 was acetylated by p300/CBP in two regions: repression domain (K297/305/307) and P domain (K171/419). Acetylation of Repression domain was not required for HBP1 transactivation on p16(INK4A). However, luciferase assay and western blotting results indicate that acetylation of P domain, especially K419 acetylation is essential for HBP1 transactivation on p16(INK4A). As assayed by SA-beta-gal staining, the acetylation of HBP1 at K419 enhanced HBP1-induced premature senescence in 2BS cells. In addition, HDAC4 repressed HBP1-induced premature senescence through permanently deacetylating HBP1. We conclude that our data suggest that HBP1 acetylation at K419 plays an important role in HBP1-induced p16(INK4A) expression.",

The MTS1 (or CDKN2) gene on chromosome 9p encodes a cell-cycle regulator and is deleted in approximately 80% of astrocytoma cell lines. To determine whether MTS1 is the tumor suppressor gene involved in human astrocytoma formation in vivo, we have analyzed chromosome 9p allelic loss and the MTS1 gene in 30 primary astrocytomas. Deletion mapping demonstrated 15 cases with allelic loss of chromosome 9p, with all losses either flanking or involving the MTS1 gene. Direct analysis of the MTS1 gene, however, revealed only a single missense mutation in a high-grade tumor that had lost the second allele. The low frequency of MTS1 mutations in primary astrocytomas with allelic 9p loss suggests that MTS1 may be more important for in vitro than in vivo astrocytoma growth, and that another 9p tumor suppressor gene may be involved in astrocytoma formation in vivo. Analysis of the MTS1 gene also demonstrated two intragenic polymorphisms, one in exon 2 and one in the 3' untranslated region, that can be used to assay allelic loss directly at MTS1.",

However, there have been no reports of reintroduction of the p16INK4A gene into SCLC cells. To assess the biological significance of p16INK4A inactivation in the development of SCLC, full-length p16INK4A cDNA was introduced into an SCLC cell line, Ms-13, in which the p16INK4A protein was not detected. SCLC cells stably transfected with the p16INK4A expression vector formed only 2-16% of the number of neomycin-resistant colonies formed by cells transfected with a control vector, and no expression of exogenous p16INK4A protein was detected in any of 16 expanded clones. Transient transfection of the p16INK4A gene into SCLC cells resulted in exogeneous p16INK4A protein expression and dephosphorylation of endogenous retinoblastoma (RB) protein. These results suggest that the restoration of the p16INK4A function suppresses the growth of SCLC cells by dephosphorylation of the RB protein. Therefore, inactivation of p16INK4A may play an important role in the enhancement of growth of p16INK4A(-) RB(+) SCLC tumors in vivo.",

Totally, 295 cervical cone biopsies representing squamous metaplasia, reactive changes, koilocytosis, flat condyloma, CIN I, CIN II, CIN III and AIM were subjected to p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry. AIM cases were analyzed using CK 17 antibody. Typical p16(INK4a) immunoprofiles for the metaplastic, LSIL/HPV and HSIL phenotypes were recorded and used for the categorization of AIM into particular phenotype groups. Results were correlated with CK 17 immunoexpression. All CIN II and CIN III lesions, all but one case of CIN I and all flat condylomas overexpressed p16(INK4a). Other non-precancerous lesions, including koilocytosis, were predominantly negative. Contrary to the sporadic and focal immunostaining, diffuse positivity was associated with the dysplastic features of the lesion. CIN II and CIN III were characterized by a diffuse, strong/weak, full-thickness staining, whereas CIN I showed a heterogeneous diffuse/focal, weak/strong, lower half positivity. One third of AIM lesions may be reclassified as HSIL, one third as LSIL/HPV and one third shows metaplastic phenotype. All AIM cases with metaplastic and LSIL/HPV phenotypes expressed CK 17 diffusely, whereas focal positivity slightly prevailed in AIM with HSIL phenotype. We conclude that p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry is a supporting method for the differential diagnosis of cervical lesions, which may be especially useful for the reclassification of AIM.

P16 immunostaining is used as a surrogate marker for the presence of HPV in cervical and head and neck cancers. In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the association between P16 protein overexpression and HPV remains unclear. We investigated the presence of HPV genome by in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and P16 or Rb protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 336 surgically resected primary NSCLC: 204 adenocarcinoma (AdC) and 132 squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). HPV genome was detected in 5 (1.5%) of 336 tumors studied by both ISH and PCR; all of them were typed as HPV16 and found in SqCC (3.8%). Despite being solitary tumors and clinically considered as primary lung cancers, all 5 patients had past history of HPV associated squamous cell carcinomas of other organ sites, thus highly suggestive of being metastases. P16 immunostaining was found in 137 (40.8%) tumors, with 109 (32.4%) showing high level expression. All HPV positive (+) cases showed P16 high expression. P16 and Rb protein expressions were inversely correlated (P<0.001), suggesting that the high P16 expression is largely driven by non-HPV loss of Rb protein expression.

To determine if alterations in the coding regions of the p18 and p19 genes, which are novel members of the INK4 family and if they correlate with the development of human cancer, 100 human cancer cell lines were analyzed. Two other INK4 gene family members, p15INK4b/MTS2 and p16INK4/MTS1 genes were also analyzed. Homozygous deletions of the p15INK4b/MTS2 gene were detected in 29 cancer cell lines. Thirty-five homozygous deletions and 7 intragenic mutations of the pl6INK4/MTS1 gene were also detected in these cell lines. Neither homozygous deletions nor intragenic mutations of the p18 and p19 genes were found except in an ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3, harboring a single base pair deletion in exon 1 of p19. In p16INK4/MTS1 expression analysis, 5 cell lines with both authentic and alternative spliced p16INK4/MTS1 mRNA had no detectable p16INK4/MTS1 protein. These results suggest the hypotheses that either post-translational modification or enhanced degradation may be responsible for the lack of detection of the p16INK4/MTS1 protein. Using Western blot analysis, subsets of 26 human cancer cell lines were examined for p18 expression and 39 cell lines for p19 expression. All of these cell lines expressed the p18 or p19 protein, with the exception of SKOV3, which did not express p19. Therefore, the INK4 gene family may be divided into 2 groups. One group includes p15INK4b/MTS2 and p16INK4/MTS1, in which genetic and epigenetic alterations might contribute to the development of human cancers.

Although surgery offers the best chance for survival, it is not appropriate for all cases. The only adjuvant treatment to show promise is chemotherapy. Hence new treatments are urgently sought. We previously reported that adenoviral (Ad)-mediated delivery of p53 (Adp53) and p16(INK4A) (Adp16) significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines and established subcutaneous pancreatic tumours in nude mice (Ghaneh P, et al. Adenovirus mediated transfer of p53 and p16INK4A results in pancreatic cancer regression in vitro and in vivo. Gene Ther 2001; 8: 199-208). In this study we examine whether combining Ad-mediated delivery of p53 or p16(INK4A) with clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drugs has therapeutic potential for pancreatic cancer.;Four pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were evaluated for their sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine and two of these, Suit-2 and Panc-1, were chosen for combination experiments because they showed moderate and poor sensitivity, respectively, to 5-FU and gemcitabine. We found no evidence for enhanced cytotoxicity when either cell line was transduced with Adp53 before or after incubation with chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast, incubation of Panc-1 cells with either 5-FU or gemcitabine followed by Ad-mediated overexpression of p16(INK4A) resulted in a substantial reduction in cell viability under conditions where the drugs alone had minimal cytotoxicity. Incubation of Suit-2 cells with 5-FU followed by Ad-mediated overexpression of p16(INK4A) also resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability. This, however, was observed only with higher concentrations of 5-FU and viral vector. Cell cycle analysis of Panc-1 cells showed that the combination of cytotoxic drugs and Adp16 resulted in an increase in the sub-G1 population suggesting an increase in apoptosis. Dual labelling of these cells with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) confirmed that the combination of 5-FU and Adp16 resulted in a significant increase in early apoptotic cells (annexin V positive and PI negative) compared with controls. Moreover, overexpression of p16(INK4A) was associated with a reduction in pRb levels in these cells-high levels of pRb have been proposed to contribute to chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells.;We have shown that the currently used chemotherapeutic drugs for pancreatic adenocarcinoma combined with restoration of p16(INK4A) expression hold promise for the adjuvant treatment of this disease. Importantly, the combination facilitated the use of chemotherapeutic drugs at lower concentrations than would otherwise be effective.",

To determine whether this difference can be translated into a therapeutic advantage to protect normal cells from adverse cytotoxicity caused by chemotherapy, we established cell model systems for ecdysone-inducible expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), and p27(Kip1) in one CKI-responsive cell line (A431 human vulvar epidermoid carcinoma cells with functional Rb) and one CKI-unresponsive cell line (SiHa human cervical cancer cells with nonfunctional Rb). Expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) in both SiHa and A431 cells strongly inhibited CDK2 activity, indicating functional expression of the CDK inhibitors in both cell lines. However, only in A431 cells did expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) cause Rb dephosphorylation, arrest cell cycle traversal, and potently inhibit cell proliferation. Induction of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) in SiHa cells failed to cause Rb dephosphorylation or to arrest cell cycle traversal, and such induction only minimally inhibited cell proliferation. We then compared the chemosensitivity of clones derived from these two cell lines when the CKIs were and were not induced. Induction of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) conferred strong resistance to paclitaxel- or cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity on the CKI-responsive A431 cells but not on the CKI-unresponsive SiHa cells. Our results support a novel chemotherapy strategy for treating patients with Rb pathway-impaired cancers by concurrent administration of chemotherapy with CKIs as chemoprotective agents for normal cells.",

Control of thymocyte proliferation is critical to insure the full function of the immune system and to prevent T cells from transformation. Deletion of the cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) is frequently observed in human T cell neoplasias and, in mice, gene targeted inactivation of the Ink4a locus enhances thymocyte expansion and predisposes mutant animal to tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which p16(Ink4a) controls thymocyte development by analyzing transgenic mice expressing the human p16(INK4a) into the T cell lineage. We show that forced expression of p16(INK4a) in thymocytes blocked T cell differentiation at the early CD4-CD8-CD3-CD25+ stage without significantly affecting the development of gammadelta T cells. Pre-TCR function was mimicked by the induction of CD3 signaling in thymocytes of recombinase activating gene (RAG)-2-deficient mice (RAG-2(-/-)). Upon anti-CD3epsilon treatment in vivo, p16(INK4a)-expressing RAG-2(-/-) thymocytes were not rescued from apoptosis, nor could they differentiate.

We previously found that during fibrosarcoma (FS) progression, GR displays only modest transcriptional activity in the preneoplastic stages, whereas it is highly active in FS cells. Now, we report that glucocorticoids reduce proliferation throughout FS development. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a) is frequently absent in many cancers, including FSs. We observed that p16(INK4a) protein expression is lost at the tumor stage of FS progression. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restores p16(INK4a) expression and reverts the phenotype of FS cells to low GR transcriptional activity, similar to that of the p16(INK4a)-expressing preneoplastic stages. Importantly, exogenous p16(INK4a) introduced by cotransfection is sufficient to reduce GR activity in FS cells, without affecting GR activity in p16-positive aggressive fibromatosis cells. Furthermore, GR transcriptional activity is elevated in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from INK4a(-/-) mice compared with those derived from WT mice, implying that the difference in p16(INK4a) expression is sufficient to modulate GR activity. These results suggest a relationship between steroid hormone receptor activity and cell cycle inhibition, whereby absence of p16(INK4a) protein leads to higher GR transactivation activity and reduced cell sensitivity to dexamethasone. This observation might have important implications for current cancer therapies.",

In this study, we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of cyclin D1, retinoblastoma (Rb), p16INK4 and p27KIP1 expression in 36 squamous dysplasias and 34 early squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus. The frequency of cyclin D1 overexpression was similar in dysplasias and early cancers (30% vs. 35%). Loss of p16INK4 and p27KIP1 expression was less frequent in dysplasias than in early cancers (p=0.005 and 0.001, respectively). Loss of Rb protein expression was not detected in dysplasia and rarely observed in early cancer (7%). The proliferation cell nuclear antigen index increased from moderate dysplasia to mucosal invasive carcinoma and was correlated significantly with the expression of cyclin D1, p16INK4 and p27KIP1 (p=0.0001, 0.003, and 0.007, respectively). Thus, this study found that cyclin D1 overexpression starts early in dysplasia and could be a useful marker for its malignant potentiality while reduction of p16INK4 and p27KIP1 occurs during the transformation from dysplasia to cancer.

Hepatocyte odd protein shuttling (HOPS) is also a ubiquitously expressed protein that moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Within the nucleus of resting cells, HOPS overexpression causes cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. HOPS knockdown causes centrosome hyperamplification leading to multinucleated cells and the formation of micronuclei. We demonstrate a direct interaction of HOPS with NPM and p19(Arf), resulting in a functionally active trimeric complex. NPM appeared to regulate HOPS half-life, which, in turn, stabilized p19(Arf) and controlled its localization in the nucleolus. These findings suggest that HOPS acts as a functional bridge in the interaction between NPM and p19(Arf), providing new mechanistic insight into how NPM and p19(Arf) will oppose tumor cell proliferation.

Deletion of Arf and/or p53 led to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and a significant increase in cell motility.

In response to hyperproliferative signals, p14(Arf) stabilizes p53 by binding to Hdm2 and inhibits the ubiquitination and subsequent proteosome-dependent degradation of p53. The medical importance of the Arf-Hdm2-p53 regulatory system is highlighted by the finding that either p53 or p14(Arf) are lost or modified in virtually all human cancers. Isolated Arf and Hdm2 domains are dynamically disordered in solution, yet they retain the ability to interact in vitro and in cellular assays. Upon binding, domains of both Arf and Hdm2 undergo a dramatic transition from disordered conformations to extended structures comprised of beta-strands. The presence of domains from both proteins are necessary and sufficient for the formation of the highly stable extended beta structures. We have mapped sites within Arf and Hdm2 that interact at a resolution of five amino acid residues using surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry confirm the presence of multiple interaction domains within each protein. Both p14(Arf) (human) and p19(Arf) (mouse) interact with Hdm2 through two short motifs present in their N termini. The Arf interacting region of Hdm2 is also composed of two short sequences located in the central acidic domain, between residues 235-264 and 270-289. The binding-induced structural transition is also induced by short peptides, 15 amino acids in length, that contain the binding motifs. Micro-injection and live cell imaging of proteins tagged with fluorescent labels was used to confirm the in vivo function of the interaction domains.

Forty-eight oral squamous cell carcinomas were included in the analyses. Deletion analysis was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mutation analysis was restricted to exon 1 and exon 2 of the p16 gene, previously shown to have a high incidence of mutations. The sequences containing exon 1 and exon 2 were amplified by PCR and screened with a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. Samples showing band shifts in SSCP were sequenced by PCR direct sequencing. Western blots were used to detect the protein expression of the p16 gene, and the results were evaluated with regard to their biological relevance in correlation with clinicopathological factors. Seven (14.6%) deletions were found; 5 (10.4%) mutations were discovered and located in different codons; 26 (54%) specimens had no p16 protein expression; in 11 specimens with p16 deletion or mutation, p16 protein could not be detected. One mutation was non-sense. The p16 gene alterations showed no relationship with location and clinical stage of cancer; however, a close relationship between p16 alterations and cancer metastasis to neck lymph node was found. The alteration rate gradually elevated from well to poorly differentiated grades. We perceive two results. First, the alterations of the p16 gene are common in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Second, the alterations of the p16 gene may attribute to the metastatic behavior or histological grade of cancer cells.",

ARF stabilizes and activates p53 by negating the effects of mdm2 on p53. Furthermore, its function is not restricted to the p53 pathway and it also inhibits cell proliferation in cells lacking p53. Expression of ARF is up-regulated in response to a number of oncogenic stimuli including E2F1. We show here that while oncogenic Ras does not significantly affect p1(4AR)F expression in normal human cells it activates p1(4AR)F in cells containing deregulated E2F. Moreover, oncogenic Ras and E2F1 synergize in activating p1(4AR)F expression. Activation of p1(4AR)F promoter by E2F1 persists in the absence of the consensus E2F-binding sites in this promoter, indicating that this activation also occurs through non- canonical binding sites. The activation by oncogenic Ras requires both E2F and Sp-1 activity, demonstrating the complex regulation of p14(ARF) in response to oncogenic stimuli.",

The clinical context, results of concurrent Papanicolaou smears/ThinPrep slides and Digene hybrid capture tests for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes, as well as follow-up cervical smears/ThinPrep, biopsies and loop excisions of transformation zones or cone biopsies were all correlated with the morphological and immunohistochemical findings.;Seventy-seven biopsies (40.7%) displayed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2-3), 27 (14.3%) showed a low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HPV +/- CIN1) and 85 (45%) showed a range of non-dysplastic (inflammatory or reactive) changes. Diffuse strong parabasal immunostaining for p16(INK4a), suggestive of integrated high-risk HPV DNA into the host genome, was observed in 81 biopsies (42.9%, including the cervical polyp) and correlated (>90%) with HGSIL in the H&E sections. Only one case revealed irreconcilable discordance between the histological features and this strong parabasal immunostaining pattern. Focal and weaker midzonal or superficial p16(INK4a) immunostaining, suggestive of episomal HPV infection, was noted in 19 biopsies (10%) and these biopsies exhibited a range of histological changes but predominantly low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL). No staining of the squamous epithelium was seen in 89 biopsies (47.1%). Again, only one case revealed irreconcilable discordance between the histological features and this negative immunostaining pattern. On review of all cases where discordant results were noted between the H&E appearances and expected p16(INK4a) immunostaining, we found 26 cases (13.7%) in which this discordance prompted justifiable modification of the original diagnosis.;Thus, within a routine diagnostic laboratory, p16(INK4a) immunostaining appears to be a very useful adjunctive test in the examination of colposcopically directed cervical biopsies, in the diagnostic cascade of women investigated for abnormal Papanicolaou smears. It is possible, as further data accumulate concerning the importance of integration of high-risk HPV DNA into the host cell genome and the reliability with which this can be identified by p16(INK4a) immunostaining, that this will become the diagnostic 'lesion of interest', replacing the subjective histological grading of cervical dysplasia, in the management of such patients; i.e., the discriminatory watershed between continued surveillance and active intervention.",

Cdk4/6 inhibitors are currently being used in advanced clinical trials and show great promise against many types of tumors. Cdk4 and Cdk6 are inhibited by INK4 proteins, which exert tumor-suppressing functions. To test the significance of this inhibitory mechanism, we generated knock-in mice that express a Cdk6 mutant (Cdk6 R31C) insensitive to INK4-mediated inhibition. Cdk6(R/R) mice display altered development of the hematopoietic system without enhanced tumor susceptibility, either in the presence or absence of p53. Unexpectedly, Cdk6 R31C impairs the potential of hematopoietic progenitors to repopulate upon adoptive transfer or after 5-fluorouracil-induced damage. The defects are overcome by eliminating sensitivity of cells to INK4 inhibitors by introducing the INK4-insensitive Cdk4 R24C allele, and INK4-resistant mice are more susceptible to hematopoietic and endocrine tumors. In BCR-ABL-transformed hematopoietic cells, Cdk6 R31C causes increased binding of p16(INK4a) to wild-type Cdk4, whereas cells harboring Cdk4 R24C and Cdk6 R31C are fully insensitive to INK4 inhibitors, resulting in accelerated disease onset.

The CDKN2A locus, which houses the INK4a and ARF tumor suppressor genes, is frequently altered in NSCLC. However, the specific role of ARF in pulmonary tumorigenesis remains unclear. KRAS and other oncogenes induce the expression of ARF, thus stabilizing p53 activity and arresting cell proliferation. To address the role of ARF in Kras-driven NSCLC, we compared the susceptibility of NIH/Ola strain wild-type and Arf-knockout mice to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis. Lung tumor size, malignancy and associated morbidity were significantly increased in Arf(-/-) compared with Arf(+/+) animals at 25 weeks after induction. Pulmonary tumors from Arf-knockout mice exhibited increased cell proliferation and DNA damage compared with wild-type mice. A subgroup of tumors in Arf(-/-) animals presented as dedifferentiated and metastatic, with many characteristics of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, a neoplasm previously undocumented in mouse models. Our finding of a role for ARF in NSCLC is consistent with the observation that benign adenomas from Arf(+/+) mice robustly expressed ARF, while ARF expression was markedly reduced in malignant adenocarcinomas. ARF expression also frequently colocalized with the expression of p21(CIP1), a transcriptional target of p53, arguing that ARF induces the p53 checkpoint to arrest cell proliferation in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that induction of ARF is an early response in lung tumorigenesis that mounts a strong barrier against tumor growth and malignant progression. ",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the utility of p16(INK4a) (p16) and IMP3 staining of LBC specimens to increase the concordance rate. A total of 98 cell blocks with biopsy results, including 37 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 36 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and 25 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), were selected for the immunocytochemical analysis of p16 and IMP3. The LBC diagnoses corresponded with histological diagnoses for 59.5% (22/37), 63.9% (23/36), and 88.0% (22/25) of LSIL, HSIL, and SCC lesions, respectively. We found a high frequency of p16 positivity in HSIL (72.2%) and SCC (100%), but not LSIL (29.7%). IMP3 was frequently expressed in SCC (84.0%), but rarely in LSIL (8.1%) and HSIL (25.0%). Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1) was negative for both p16 and IMP3, CIN2/3 tended to be positive for p16 and negative for IMP3, and SCC was positive for both p16 and IMP3. The combination of p16 and IMP3 immunostaining had a higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting CIN1 and CIN2/3 than cytology. For detecting SCC, p16/IMP3 had a higher sensitivity than cytology, but a lower specificity. IMP3 is a useful diagnostic immunomarker that can be used to identify SCC and the combination of p16/IMP3 expression was found to improve the discrepant results between cytologic and histologic diagnoses.

        "Doc_abstract":"Two distinct types of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas and their precursors, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias (VIN), which differ in terms of clinical presentation and behavior, have been delineated. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated carcinomas are of basaloid or warty type, whereas tumors unrelated to HPV are usually keratinizing and differentiated. Thus, the major stratifying factor for vulvar carcinomas and VIN is their etiopathogenetic relationship with HPV. However, because of technical difficulties in confidently detecting HPV in tissues, this diagnosis is usually based on purely morphologic criteria, even though some overlap exists between these histologic types. Recently, the tumor suppressor protein p16 has been shown to be specifically overexpressed in HPV-related carcinomas and premalignant lesions of the uterine cervix, oral cavity, and anus, but the presence of p16 vulvar squamous lesions has not been examined. We have evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of p16 in a series of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded vulvar carcinomas and their putative precursors. p16 was strongly positive in all cases of basaloid/condylomatous VIN3 (30/30) and basaloid (7/7) and warty (3/3) carcinomas. In contrast, p16 was almost consistently negative in normal skin, squamous cell hyperplasia (0/20), lichen sclerosus (0/19), differentiated (simplex) VIN3 (0/11), verrucous carcinoma (0/2), and keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (3/33, 9%). One of the keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas positive for p16 occurred in a 25-year-old woman and the other two were associated with small foci of basaloid VIN3 adjacent to the tumor, suggesting a probable relationship with HPV. p16 was positive in 6 of 10 of basal cell carcinomas. In conclusion, p16 immunostaining is a good discriminator between HPV-associated and HPV-unrelated vulvar carcinomas and VIN, although it cannot differentiate basaloid squamous and basal cell carcinoma.",

ARF provides an 'oncogenic checkpoint' function through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel p53-independent interaction between p14(ARF) and the adenovirus oncoprotein E1A. p14(ARF) inhibits E1A transcriptional function and promotes ubiquitination-dependent degradation of E1A. p14(ARF) overexpression relocalizes E1A into the nucleolus and inhibits E1A-induced cellular DNA replication independent of p53. Knockdown of endogenous p14(ARF) increases E1A transactivation. In addition, E1A can competitively inhibit ARF-Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) complex formation. These results identify a novel binding partner of p14(ARF) and reveal a mutually inhibitory interaction between p14(ARF) and E1A. We speculate that the ARF-E1A interaction may represent an additional host defence mechanism to limit viral replication. Alternatively, the interaction may allow adenovirus to sense the functional state of p53 in host cells, and fine-tune its own replication activity to prevent the triggering of a detrimental host response.",

Two of the cell lines, SCC15 and SCC40 have a hypermethylated p16ink4A promoter and a third cell line, SCC9, has a mutation in the p16ink4a promoter. Using the demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, we showed that the p16ink4a protein was re-expressed after a 5-day treatment with this chemical. One cell line, SCC15 expressed high levels of p16ink4a. In this line, cdk6 activity was decreased after 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine treatment, and the hypophosphorylated, growth suppressive form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein pRB was detected. Expression of p16ink4a persisted, even after the drug was removed and the cells expressed senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. Ectopic expression of p16ink4a with a recombinant retrovirus in this cell line also induced a similar senescence-like phenotype.

These two pathways present numerous interactions and the polymerase (PARP) in relation with p53 and activated by telomere shortening might represent via p21Waf1 a link between this shortening and cell cycle control.

Twenty-eight tumours which were typed positive for HPV16 DNA, were comprehensively analysed for expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7, the status of the p53 gene, and the protein status of pRb and p16(INK4a). In a subset of cases, we have searched for integrated viral DNA, and have determined the genomic status of the E6 gene. Expression of E6/E7 was found in 12 tumours most of which were derived from the oropharynx, whereas p53 mutations were present in 13 tumours from various sites. The tumours either carried p53 mutations but did not express E6/E7, or they did express E6/E7 but were p53-wild-type. Coexistence of E6/E7 expression with a mutated p53 was found in only one case. Strikingly, in most p53-mutated tumours without E6/E7 expression, we found the E6 gene to be disrupted. E6/E7 expression was associated with reduced pRb and overexpressed p16(INK4a). Viral-cellular fusion transcripts were found in two cases. Our data demonstrate that HPV16 DNA-positivity in head and neck cancers is not indicative of a causal role. A causal role of HPV16 in head and neck cancer is defined by: E6/E7 expression, viral integration with an intact E6 gene, and perturbation of pRb cell cycle control. Mostly, the p53 gene is wild-type.",

We report here that forced expression of p14ARF enhances phosphorylation of p53 serine 15 (p53S15) in NIH3T3, IMR90 and MCF7 cells. Ectopic expression of the oncogenes c-myc, E2F1 and E1A, all of which activate p53 at least partially via ARF, lead to p53S15 phosphorylation in IMR90 cells. In addition, ectopic expression of p53 also results in p53S15 phosphorylation, suggesting that this is a common event in the ARF-p53 tumor suppression system. Furthermore, p53-, p14ARF-, c-myc- and E2F1-, but not E1A-, induced p53S15 phosphorylation was substantially reduced in AT fibroblasts (GM05823). Downregulation of ATM in MCF7 cells using RNA interference (RNAi) technology significantly attenuated p14ARF- and p53-induced phosphorylation of p53S15. Ectopically expressed ARF in NIH3T3 cells induced ATM nuclear foci and activated ATM kinase. Functionally, ectopic expression of p14ARF and c-myc inhibited the proliferation of IMR90 but not ATM null GM05823 cells, and p14ARF-induced inhibition of MCF7 cell proliferation was significantly attenuated by downregulation of ATM by RNAi.

In this study, we compared the antigen-specific T cell responses between wild type (+/+) and p19(ARF)-deficient (p19-/-) mice following an acute infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). p19-/- mice mounted a potent CD8 T cell response and the magnitude of expansion of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells was comparable to that of +/+ mice. Further, the clonal downsizing of the expanded virus-specific CD8 T cells and establishment of long-term T cell memory were minimally affected by p19(ARF) deficiency.

The process involves a proliferative phase during which highly viable primary transformants expand, followed by a period of marked apoptosis (called \"crisis\") that is dependent on the presence of p19(Arf) and p53; rare cells that survive this phase emerge as fully transformed and malignant. To understand the way in which v-Abl expression affects p19(Arf) expression, we examined changes in expression of Arf during all stages of Ab-MLV transformation process. As is consistent with the ability of v-Abl to stimulate Myc, a transcription factor known to induce p19(Arf), Myc and Arf are induced soon after infection and p19(Arf) is expressed. At these early time points, the infected cells remain highly viable. The onset of crisis is marked by an increase in p19(Arf) expression and a change in localization of the protein from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus. These data together suggest that the localization and expression levels of p19(Arf) modulate the effects of the protein during oncogenesis and reveal that the p19(Arf)-mediated response is subject to multiple layers of regulation that influence its function during Ab-MLV-mediated transformation.",

The patterns of p16(INK4a) and Lsh expression during cell senescence present the inverse correlation. We also find that Lsh requires histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity to repress p16(INK4a) and treatment with trichostatin A (TSA) is sufficient to block the repressor effect of Lsh. Moreover, overexpression of Lsh is correlated with deacetylation of histone H3 at the p16 promoter, and TSA treatment in Lsh-expressing cells reverses the acetylation status of histones. Additionally, we demonstrate an interaction between Lsh, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2 in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Lsh interacts in vivo with the p16 promoter and recruits HDAC1.

We analyzed to what extent the number of cell doublings may participate to p16(ink4a) expression in normal and malignant lymphocytes. p16(ink4a) expression, not found in normal quiescent B or T-lymphocytes, was observed after stimulation of B-lymphocytes (72 h) and T-lymphocytes (2 weeks) before the occurrence of replicative senescence markers such as senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase activity. Afterwards, in lymphocyte long-term cultures, the increase in p16(ink4a) followed the expression of features of cell ageing. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the analysis of the individual differences between peripheral blood and blood compartments (34 cases) showed a decrease in cell proliferation (p<0.005), in telomerase activity (p<0.0005), and in hTERT expression (p<0.04), associated with an increase of p16(ink4a) (p<0.035) in blood leukemic cells. These results support the hypothesis that (i) an increase in p16(ink4a) expression in normal lymphocytes is linked, in part, to the number of cell doublings before the occurrence of replicative senescence and (ii) this process is maintained in leukemic cell populations of numerous patients.",

Our previous work demonstrates that cells lacking p16(INK4A) activity exhibit phenotypes associated with malignancy (Romanov et al. 2001). The acquisition of genomic instability occurs through the activation of telomeric and centrosomal dysfunction. Additionally, the activation of stress pathways such as COX-2 provides these cells with the mutagenic potential to survive adverse environments as well as the ability to migrate, evade apoptosis and immune surveillance, and summon sustaining vasculature. Examination of archived tissue from women with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) reveals epithelial cells that overexpress markers of premalignant stress activation pathways and mirror the distinctive expression patterns of these markers observed in vitro. These epithelial cells are found within the premalignant lesion as well as in the field of morphologically normal tissue that surrounds the lesion. Here, we show that p16(INK4A)-silenced vHMEC cells exhibit a gene expression profile which is distinct, reproducible, and extends beyond the changes mediated by p16(INK4A) inactivation. The present work suggests that cells lacking p16(INK4A) activity exhibit critical activities which allow cells to evade differentiation processes that would be expected to terminate proliferation. All of these properties are critical to malignancy. These events may be useful biomarkers to detect the earliest events in breast cancer.",

However, deletion of Ink4a/Arf only partially rescues Bmi1-null phenotypes, indicating that other important targets of BMI1 exist. Here, using the continuously growing mouse incisor as a model system, we report that Bmi1 is expressed by incisor stem cells and that deletion of Bmi1 resulted in fewer stem cells, perturbed gene expression and defective enamel production. Transcriptional profiling revealed that Hox expression is normally repressed by BMI1 in the adult, and functional assays demonstrated that BMI1-mediated repression of Hox genes preserves the undifferentiated state of stem cells. As Hox gene upregulation has also been reported in other systems when Bmi1 is inactivated, our findings point to a general mechanism whereby BMI1-mediated repression of Hox genes is required for the maintenance of adult stem cells and for prevention of inappropriate differentiation.",

Specifically, HDAC3 and HDAC4 inhibited the p16(INK4a) promoter activity. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays verified that HDAC3 and HDAC4 were recruited to p16(INK4a) promoter by YY1. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that these three protein factors formed a complex. Furthermore, knockdown of these factors induced cell enlargement and flattened morphology and significantly increased the SA-beta-gal activity, a biochemical marker of cell senescence.

The absence of p19ARF in the mouse leads to early tumor susceptibility, presumably in part due to decreased p53 activity. To examine the tumorigenic cooperativity of p19ARF, Mdm2, and p53 in vivo, p19ARF-deficient mice were crossed first to p53-deficient mice and then to Mdm2 transgenic mice. The progeny were monitored for tumors. Cooperativity between p19ARF and p53 deficiencies in accelerating tumor formation was observed for most genotypes except p53-/- p19ARF-/- mice. p53-/- p19ARF-/- mice had a tumor incidence similar to p53-/- mice. In this context, tumor suppression by ARF appears to be primarily p53 dependent. The majority of the p19ARF+/- tumors deleted the wildtype p19ARF allele, in agreement with the previous studies, suggesting that p19ARF is a classic 'two hit' tumor suppressor. In a p53+/- background, however, all p19ARF+/- tumors retained a wildtype ARF allele and most also retained wildtype p53. In the second cross between p19ARF-deficient and Mdm2 transgenic mice, cooperativity in tumor incidence between Mdm2 overexpression and ARF deficiency was observed, consistent with the role of p19ARF in negatively regulating Mdm2 activity. These experiments further demonstrate in vivo the inter-relationships of the p19ARF-Mdm2-p53 signaling axis in tumor suppression.",

Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinical and pathological characteristics.;Multiple alterations at various checkpoints of cell cycle progression were observed. Loss of P16 protein was less common in oropharyngeal tumors than at other HNSCC locations (P = 0.02). Evaluation of the simultaneous expression of different proteins highlighted direct correlations (P < 0.05) such as that of the cyclin-dependent kinases with their cyclin-partners, and the Ki-67 protein with cyclin-dependent kinases 1, cyclin A (CA) and cyclin B1.

Loss of p16(INK4a) expression has also been frequently observed in more common neoplasms such as lung cancer as well. In a wide variety of these malignancies, including lung cancer, p16(INK4a) expression is known to be inactivated by hypermethylation of the first exon. In a survey of ten mesothelioma cell lines, one cell line (NCI-H2596) was identified as possessing loss of p16(INK4a) gene product following gene methylation. This methylation in these mesothelioma cells could be reversed, resulting in re-expression of p16(INK4a) protein, following the treatment of the cells with cytidine analogs, which are known inhibitors of DNA methylation. In previous clinical trials in mesothelioma, the cytidine analog dihydro-5-azacytidine (DHAC) has been found to induce clinical responses in approximately 17% of patients with mesothelioma treated with this drug, including prolonged complete responses. In addition, we identified evidence for methylation of p16(INK4a) in three of 11 resected mesothelioma tumor samples. When both cell lines and tumors are combined, inactivation of p16(INK4a) gene product expression following DNA hypermethylation was found in four of 21 samples (19%).

Transduction of mesothelioma cells with adenoviruses bearing the p53 gene (Ad-p53) induced phosphorylation of p53, upregulated Mdm2 and p21 expression levels and decreased phosphorylation of pRb. The transduction generated cleavage of caspase-8 and -3, but not caspase-9.

Transduction with Ad-p53 suppressed viability of mesothelioma cells and augmented the growth inhibition by CDDP or PEM mostly in a synergistic manner. Intrapleural injection of Ad-p53 and systemic administration of CDDP produced anti-tumor effects in an orthotopic animal model.

Inappropriate proliferative signals generated by proto-oncogenes, such as c-Myc and E2F1, can elevate both p19(ARF) and smARF proteins. The two ARF isoforms differ not only in their localization but also in their functions. Nucleolar p19(ARF) inhibits cell growth mainly by activating p53 or by inhibiting ribosomal biogenesis. In contrast, mitochondrial smARF can induce dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and autophagy in a p53 independent manner. Recently, it was proposed by Abida et al., that similar to smARF, the nucleolar p19(ARF) can also induce p53 independent autophagy, but in contrast to smARF it does so from within the nucleolus. Our current work shown here indicates, however, that if the ectopic expression of p19(ARF) is restricted to the nucleolus it cannot induce autophagic vesicle formation. Only upon extreme overexpression, when p19(ARF) is localized to extra nuclear compartments, can it trigger p53-independent autophagic vesicle formation. Thus, our experiments indicate that the nucleolar p19(ARF) is incapable of inducing autophagy from within the nucleolus.",

RISH signals were clearly visible at low to medium magnification in 97% of positive cases, facilitating almost-perfect inter-observer reproducibility. The performance of the manual and automated RISH platforms were equivalent (kappa=0.915).

Like the previously described human INK4 polypeptides, p16INK4a/MTS1 and p15INK4b/MTS2, mouse p19 and p18 are primarily composed of tandemly repeated ankyrin motifs, each ca. 32 amino acids in length, p19 and p18 bind directly to CDK4 and CDK6, whether untethered or in complexes with D cyclins, and can inhibit the activity of cyclin D-bound cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Although neither protein interacts with D cyclins or displaces them from preassembled cyclin D-CDK complexes in vitro, both form complexes with CDKs at the expense of cyclins in vivo, suggesting that they may also interfere with cyclin-CDK assembly. In proliferating macrophages, p19 mRNA and protein are periodically expressed with a nadir in G1 phase and maximal synthesis during S phase, consistent with the possibility that INK4 proteins limit the activities of CDKs once cells exit G1 phase. However, introduction of a vector encoding p19 into mouse NIH 3T3 cells leads to constitutive p19 synthesis, inhibits cyclin D1-CDK4 activity in vivo, and induces G1 phase arrest.",

Tumour cells from HDN are leukaemic counterparts of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Despite increased knowledge of the ontogenetic origin of these tumours, the genetic causes and oncogenic signalling events involved in malignant transformation are still unknown. To delineate novel candidate regions and disease-related genes, we studied nine typical CD4+CD56+ HDN cases using genome-wide high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Genomic imbalances, which were predominantly losses, were frequently detected. Gross genomic losses or gains involving an entire chromosome were observed in eight cases. The most frequent imbalances were deletions of chromosome 9, chromosome 13 and partial losses affecting 17p or 12p. Combinations of deletions of tumour suppressor genes (TSG), namely RB1, CDKN1B (p27), CDKN2A, (p16(ink4a), p14(arf)) or TP53 (p53), were observed in all cases. These results indicate that deletion events altering G1/S regulation are crucial for HDN oncogenesis. Furthermore, in addition to frequent sporadic gene losses, in one case we observed a 8q24 interstitial deletion that brought MYC closer to miR-30b/miR-30d, which may be related to their deregulation. Taken together, these results indicate that in addition to frequent G1/S checkpoint alterations, various genetic events could contribute to the chemoresistance of the tumour.",

It was shown that the MSCs underwent replicative senescence after 24 to 25 population doublings, characterized by positive staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase, increased expression of p16(INK4a) and p21, and downregulated phosphorylation of Rb. The upregulation of p16(INK4a) was associated with decreased expression of enhancer of the zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), and reduced levels of H3K27me and DNA methylation in the p16(INK4a) gene. At week 4 of senescence, reproliferating cells emerged among the senescent MSCs. These senescence-escaped MSCs lost their senescence-related markers (including p16(INK4a)) and became highly proliferative. In addition to H3K27me, another H3 modification pattern, H3K9me, appeared in the p16(INK4a) gene, accompanied by an enhanced DNA methylation. With continued culture, the senescence-escaped MSCs did not show any sign of growth arrest and gained the capacity for anchorage-independent growth. These immortalized (transformed) MSCs showed further enhanced DNA methylation of the p16(INK4a) gene by increased H3K9me. Ezh2 knockdown with shRNA eliminated H3K27me-mediated DNA methylation of the p16(INK4a) gene in presenescent MSCs, but had no effect on H3K9me-enhanced DNA hypermethylation in the cells after senescence escape. These findings identify an Ezh2- and H3K27me-independent, but H3K9me-enhanced, DNA hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a) gene, which might be an epigenetic signature for MSC spontaneous transformation.",

Seven cases exhibited low-grade nuclear features, low mitotic counts (median: 2/10HPFs) and no tumor cell necrosis. They were all at FIGO stage I.

Understanding the upstream signaling pathway that turns on the expression of p16 is required both for knowing the tumorigenic stresses from which this pathway provides protection and for appreciating the selective pressure that leads to the loss of this pathway in most human tumors. We report that COOH-terminal binding protein (CtBP), a physiologically regulated transcriptional corepressor that dimerizes to hold together repressive complexes, regulates p16 expression in primary human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Interfering with CtBP-mediated repression increased p16 expression and accelerated senescence. CtBP had little influence on the expression of the alternate product of the CDKN2A tumor-suppressor gene, p14(ARF). Loss of CtBP-mediated repression diminished the Polycomb-based epigenetic histone mark that is reported to favor silencing of p16 via DNA methylation. Enhancing CtBP-mediated repression by growing cells in low oxygen increased the association of CtBP with the p16 promoter, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reduced p16 expression. Stresses and stimuli that reduce CtBP-mediated repression are associated with increased p16 expression; therefore, CtBP may provide a common final target for regulating the balance among tumor suppression, regenerative capacity, and senescence.",

Previous studies have indicated that human keratinocytes can be immortalized by telomerase activity alone when grown in co-culture with feeder cells, suggesting that loss of the p16(INK4a)/Rb pathway is not required for immortalization. Using two independent human keratinocyte cell strains, we found that exogenous telomerase expression and co-culture with feeder cells results in efficient extension of lifespan without an apparent crisis. However, when these cells were transferred from the co-culture environment to plastic alone they experienced only a brief period of slowed growth before continuing to proliferate indefinitely. Examination of immortal cell lines demonstrated p16(INK4a) promoter methylation had occurred in both the absence and presence of feeder cells. Reintroduction of p16(INK4a) into immortal cell lines resulted in rapid growth arrest. Our results suggest that p16(INK4a)/Rb-induced telomere-independent senescence, although delayed in the presence of feeders, still provides a proliferation barrier to human keratinocytes in this culture system and that extended culture of telomerase-transduced keratinocytes on feeders can lead to the methylation of p16(INK4a).",

The majority of the activity of ARF to date is ascribed to its ability to activate p53, resulting in a G(1) cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. We show here that ARF colocalizes with DNA replication protein A (RPA32) and that overexpression of ARF reduces the rate of DNA synthesis resulting in accumulation of an S-phase cell population. Impediment of DNA synthesis by ARF can occur and becomes more evident in the absence of p53. Hence, the biological consequence of ARF induction varies dependent on cellular p53 status, inducing predominantly a G(1) arrest or apoptosis in p53-positive cells or causing S-phase retardation when p53 function is comprised.",

E2F-binding protein 1 (E2FBP1), a transcription regulator for E2F, induces PML reduction and suppresses the formation of PML-nuclear bodies, whereas the down-regulation of E2FBP1 provokes the PML-dependent premature senescence in human normal fibroblasts. Here we report that the depletion of E2FBP1 induces the accumulation of PML through the Ras-dependent activation of MAP kinase signaling. The cellular levels of p16(INK4A) and p53 are elevated during premature senescence induced by depletion of E2FBP1, and the depletion of p16(INK4A), but not p53 rescued senescent cells from growth arrest. Therefore, the premature senescence induced by E2FBP1 depletion is achieved through the p16(INK4A)-Rb pathway. Similar to human normal fibroblasts, the growth inhibition induced by E2FBP1 depletion is also observed in human tumor cells with intact p16(INK4A) and Rb.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate patterns of p16 expression in a well-characterized cohort of prostatic adenocarcinomas while exploring potential associations between alterations of p16 and clinicopathological variables.

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry assays were used to determine the status of the INK4A exon 1alpha transcripts and levels of p16 protein, respectively. Associations between altered patterns of expression and clinicopathological variables, including pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason grade, pathological stage, and hormonal status, were evaluated using the Mantel-Haenszel chi2 test. Biochemical (PSA) relapse after surgery was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Levels of p16 expression and INK4A exon 1alpha transcripts in normal prostate and benign hyperplastic tissues were undetectable. However, p16 nuclear overexpression was observed in 38 (43%) prostate carcinomas, whereas the remaining 50 (57%) cases showed undetectable p16 levels. Overexpression of p16 protein was found to correlate with increased INK4A exon 1alpha transcripts. Moreover, p16 overexpression was associated with a higher pretreatment PSA level (P = 0.018), the use of neoadjuvant androgen ablation (P = 0.001), and a sooner time to PSA relapse after radical prostatectomy (P = 0.002).

It is the most common neoplasm appearing in the upper aerodigestive tract and the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The five-year survival rate remains poor despite advances in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Furthermore, the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer is rising. Thus, innovative therapy approaches are imperative in order to improve the situation. Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and sorafenib and sunitinib, multityrosine kinase inhibitors, have been notably effective in the therapy of different tumor entities. The modest side-effects and oral application of the drugs might improve patient compliance. Expression levels of mTOR and Amphiregulin (AREG) in p16-positive and -negative SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) and the effect of everolimus, sorafenib or sunitinib on the expression levels of these target proteins were assessed. As far as we are aware of, this is one of the first in vitro studies to evaluate the effect of these small-molecule drugs with regard to the p16 status of SCC cells.;p16-negative HNSCC 11A and 14C cells and p16-positive CERV196 cells were exposed to different concentrations of everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib for 2-8 days. Expression levels of mTOR and AREG were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared against a chemonaïve control.;AREG and mTOR were expressed in all tested cell lines. CERV196 displayed a remarkable increase of mTOR expression compared to p16-negative HNSCC. On the contrary, AREG levels were reduced by 50% in CERV196. Everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib significantly reduced mTOR expression. Everolimus significantly decreased AREG expression independently of the HPV status. Sunitinib and sorafenib increased AREG expression in HNSCC 11A and 14C but not in CERV196.;The applied drugs showed remarkable suppression of mTOR expression, which might delay tumor progression. Interestingly, sorafenib and sunitinib increased AREG in HNSCC 11A and 14C, which could be a possible evasive mechanism following incubation with these drugs. On the contrary, p16-positive CERV196 showed increased susceptibility to sorafenib and sunitinib concerning suppression of AREG expression.

The gene has been found to be deleted, truncated, mutated, or silenced by promoter methylation in a wide range of tumor types. Where melanoma CDKN2A mutations have been characterized, C --> T and CC --> TT transitions were found, indicating a direct role for ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced pyrimidine dimers in the formation of some tumors. The South American opossum, Monodelphis domestica, has been shown by our group and others to be susceptible to the induction of melanoma on chronic exposure to UVR alone. The CDKN2A gene and its exon 1beta alternate transcript p19ARF were cloned and sequenced from M. domestica to investigate the role of these genes in the development of UVR-induced melanoma and non-melanoma tumors. Both genes were first amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using cDNA from an opossum corneal-tumor cell-line library and degenerate primers based on human, mouse, and rat CDKN2A gene sequences. To verify these as normal sequences, both genes were then RT-PCR amplified from cultured normal opossum melanocyte mRNA. When comparing the tumor and melanocyte sequences, we found a UVR signature point mutation, a C --> T transition, within exon 2 in the corneal tumor cell line. The same mutation at this site in other tumors has been shown to alter the CDKN2A protein's ability to bind CDK4 kinase, which may lead to uncontrolled cell cycling. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of opossum CDKN2A showed identities relative to human, mouse, and rat between 57% and 63%, and when conserved amino acid substitutions are considered (similarity), the range is 63% to 67%.

        "Doc_abstract":"Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence. Despite advances in therapy, patients with a histologic variant of rhabdomyosarcoma known as alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) have a 5-year survival of <30%. ARMS is characterized by a chromosomal translocation generating the PAX3-FKHR fusion gene. However, ectopic expression of PAX3-FKHR often induces inhibition of cell proliferation, or cell death, when expressed in nonmuscle cells. This prompted us to explore the effect of expressing PAX3-FKHR in more relevant cells, specifically primary human skeletal muscle cells because these cells can be converted to a tumorigenic state that mimics rhabdomyosarcoma. PAX3-FKHR expression promoted both fetal and postnatal primary human skeletal muscle cell precursors to bypass the senescence growth arrest checkpoint. This bypass was accompanied by epigenetic DNA methylation of the p16(INK4A) promoter and correspondingly a loss of expression of this tumor suppressor. Knockdown of p16(INK4A) cooperated with PAX3-FKHR to drive proliferation past senescence, whereas reintroduction of wild-type p16(INK4A) in post-senescent cells caused growth arrest. Thus, PAX3-FKHR acts in concert with loss of p16(INK4A) to promote inappropriate proliferation of skeletal muscle cells. This association between PAX3-FKHR expression and p16(INK4A) loss was seen in human ARMS tumor tissue, as both human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and tissue microarrays showed a trend toward down-regulation of p16(INK4A) protein in alveolar subsets. We surmise that the generation of the PAX3-FKHR fusion protein may require loss of p16(INK4A) to promote malignant proliferation of skeletal muscle cells as an early step in ARMS tumorigenesis.",

Although analogous studies of rare nervous system tumors are needed, there are major barriers to performing such studies. Cross-species comparative oncogenomics, identifying driver mutations in mouse cancer models and validating them in human tumors, is a promising alternative. Although still in its infancy, this approach is being applied to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), rare Schwann cell-derived malignancies that occur sporadically, after radiotherapy, and in neurofibromatosis type 1. Studies of human neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors suggest that NF1 tumor suppressor loss in Schwann cells triggers cell-autonomous and intercellular changes, resulting in development of benign neurofibromas; subsequent neurofibroma-MPNST progression is caused by aberrant growth factor signaling and mutations affecting the p16(INK4A)-cyclin D1-CDK4-Rb and p19(ARF)-Mdm2-p53 cell cycle pathways. Mice with Nf1, Trp53, and/or Cdkn2a mutations that overexpress the Schwann cell mitogen neuregulin-1 or overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor validate observations in human tumors and, to various degrees, model human tumorigenesis. Genomic analyses of MPNSTs arising in neuregulin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing mice and forward genetic screens with Sleeping Beauty transposons implicate additional signaling cascades in MPNST pathogenesis. These studies confirm the utility of mouse models for MPNST driver gene discovery and provide new insights into the complexity of MPNST pathogenesis. ",

The methylation statuses of RASSF1, RARB, CDKN2A (p16INK4a, p14ARF), APC, and RUNX3 genes and long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) were validated in a large cohort (n = 140) of clinically well-annotated ESCC specimens and esophageal normal mucosa (n = 28) using a quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.;Hypermethylation of RARB, p16INK4a, RASSF1, APC, RUNX3, and p14ARF were observed in 55%, 24%, 20%, 19%, 14%, and 8% of specimens, respectively. Hypermethylation of APC was significantly associated with tumor depth (p = 0.02) and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (p = 0.03).

Nuclear immunostaining for these proteins was assessed and the expression rates (percentages of immunoreactive nuclei) in normal respiratory epithelium, inverted sinonasal papillomas, cylindrical (oncocytic) sinonasal papillomas, and squamous cell carcinomas were compared. Normal respiratory epithelium showed significantly higher pRb expression in surface cells compared to basal cells (p < 0.05). In contrast, abundant pRb expression in surface and basal cells was detected in columnar differentiation in sinonasal papillomas and adjacent mucosa. Cuboidal and squamous metaplasia in inverted papillomas showed significantly reduced pRb expression in surface cells compared to columnar epithelium in inverted papillomas (p < 0.05, respectively). Expression of p16 was detected in all epithelial cell layers of normal respiratory epithelium, sinonasal papillomas, and adjacent mucosa. Cuboidal and squamous metaplasia in inverted papillomas showed increased p16 expression in surface cells compared to columnar epithelium in inverted papillomas (p < 0.05 between squamous metaplasia and columnar epithelium).

Expression rates of cyclin D1 higher than 10% were detected only in invasive carcinomas but not in carcinoma in situ, sinonasal papillomas or respiratory epithelium. Conclusively, pRb expression accompanies terminal differentiation in columnar surface cells. Expression of pRb in proliferating basal cells is present in sinonasal papillomas and adjacent mucosa but not in normal respiratory epithelium. Cuboidal and squamous metaplasia in inverted papillomas involves downregulation of pRb expression along with increased p16 expression in surface cells.

We hypothesize that aging up-regulates the expression of p16 INK4a in VSMCs, which may increase the susceptibility of blood vessels to vascular occlusive diseases. Aortic VSMCs were obtained from young and aged mice. Cells from aged mice grew more slowly than those from their younger counterparts. Progression of cell cycle in response to serum stimulation was significantly inhibited in those cells with aging, as determined by FACS after propidium iodide staining. A significant up-regulation of p16 INK4a (2.5-fold, P=0.0012) was found in VSMC from aged animals using gene arrays. The up-regulation of this gene was further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and Western-blot experiments. Immunostaining for p16 INK4a confirmed that aortas from aged mice contained more p16 INK4a+ SMA (smooth-muscle cell actin)+ cells than aortas from young animals (26.79+/-2.45 versus 7.06+/-1.44, P=0.00027, n=4). In conclusion, we have shown that aging up-regulates the expression of p16 INK4a in VSMC in both cultures and arteries.

NPM and p14arf displayed a diffuse nuclear staining in most normal bronchial tissue. The fraction of biopsies displaying an increased MDM2 staining or a nucleolar relocalisation of NPM increased at mild and moderate dysplasia, respectively. Two different modifications occurred in p14arf expression, i.e. its loss or its nucleolar relocalisation, both increasing at severe dysplasia and both being associated with high MDM2 expression. In addition, the nucleolar relocalisation of p14arf was associated with that of NPM. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that NPM and p14arf either co-localised in the nucleoplasm or in the nucleoli, before and as a result of severe dysplasia, respectively. MDM2 was not detected in the nucleoli. Thus, changes occur in murine double minute clone 2, p14 alternate reading frame and nucleophosmin level of expression and/or cellular distribution during early steps of lung carcinogenesis. Their relative localisation as determined by immunofluorescence, supports the hypothesis that p14 alternate reading frame nucleolar relocalisation impairs p14 alternate reading frame-murine double minute clone 2 complex formation and that nucleophosmin might sequester p14 alternate reading frame.

In the current study, we demonstrated that over-expression of p12 in human pancreatic cancer cells led to cell arrest at the G1 phase and such cell cycle arrest was related to down-regulation of a number of oncogenes, such as c-Jun, Fos, and SEI1. Furthermore, unlike P16, P12 did not retain any cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-inhibitory activity. Instead, P12 exhibited a transactivating activity not found in P16. We also examined the genetic status of p12 in a cohort of 40 pancreatic tumor specimens and found that p12 alteration was prevalent in pancreatic tumors with an incidence of 70% (28/40).

As the incidence of p53 mutations is significantly lower in Hodgkin's lymphoma than in other neoplasias, we investigated whether the malfunction of other proteins in this pathway could be responsible for its inactivation. Because the existence of nucleolar complexes between p14(ARF) and Hdm2 has been described as having a critical effect on p53 function by inhibiting its degradation, we analyzed the expression and subcellular localization of these proteins in 52 cases and in Hodgkin's cell lines. Two of four cell lines revealed loss of p14(ARF) expression secondary to gene promoter methylation, this being mutually exclusive with p53 mutations (1 of 4), illustrating the existence of selective pressure to inactivate the p53 pathway. The majority of Hodgkin's samples showed a strong nucleolar expression of p14(ARF) that was not associated with Hdm2. They also showed the existence of Hdm2/p53 complexes, and the absence of complexes containing either p14(ARF)/Hdm2 or p14(ARF)/p53. The different localization of Hdm2 (nucleoplasm) and p14(ARF) (nucleoli) observed in Hodgkin's tumors and cell lines is associated with the presence of short alternatively spliced transcripts of Hdm2 lacking the ARF-binding region and the nuclear export signal. The absence of these p14(ARF)/Hdm2 nucleolar complexes could be sufficient to inactivate the pathway and may explain the low frequency of p53 mutations in this tumor.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent work has shown that expression of the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor increases with chronological age. Expression is accelerated by gerontogenic behaviors such as tobacco use and physical inactivity, and is also influenced by allelic genotype of a polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10757278 that is physically linked with the p16(INK4a) ORF. To understand the relationship between p16(INK4a) expression, chronologic age, subject characteristics and host genetics, we sought to develop a mathematical model that links p16(INK4a) expression with aging. Using an annotated dataset of 170 healthy adults for whom p16(INK4a) expression and subject genotypes were known, we developed two alternative stochastic models that relate p16(INK4a) expression to age, smoking, exercise and rs10757278 genotype. Levels of p16(INK4a) increased exponentially and then saturated at later chronologic ages. The model, which best fit the data, suggests saturation occurs because of p16(INK4a)-dependent attrition of subjects at older chronologic ages, presumably due to death or chronic illness. An important feature of our model is that factors that contribute to death in a non p16(INK4a)-dependent manner do not affect our analysis. Interestingly, tobacco-related increases in p16(INK4a) expression are predicted to arise from a decrease in the rate of p16(INK4a)-dependent death. This analysis is most consistent with the model that p16(INK4a) expression monotonically increases with age, and higher expression is associated with increased subject attrition.",

In this study, functional analyses on the role of the class II polycomb complex in cellular senescence were performed using mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) with a genetically deleted member of the complex, Mel18. Mel18-null MEFs undergo typical premature senescence accompanied by the up-regulation of ARF/p53/p16(INK4a) and decrease of Ring1b/Bmi1. Our results demonstrated that ARF or p53 deletion cancels the senescence in Mel18-null MEFs, and the fact that p16(INK4a) is up-regulated in double-null MEFs suggests that the ARF/p53 pathway plays a central role in stress-induced senescence. The in vivo binding of Ring1b and E2F3b to the ARF promoter decreased progressively in senescence, and Mel18 inactivation accelerated the exfoliation of Ring1b/E2F3b from the promoter sequence, indicating the cooperation of polycombs/E2F3b on ARF expression and cellular senescence.

However, the clinicopathological significance of CpG island hypermethylation of FHIT gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be elucidated. We studied FHIT methylation in 254 NSCLCs in order to further understand the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of FHIT methylation in NSCLC. Methylation status of the FHIT gene was examined using Methylation-Specific PCR. All statistical analyses were two-sided, with a 5% type I error rate. Hypermethylation of the FHIT gene occurred more frequently in squamous cell carcinoma than adenocarcinoma. For 93 adenocarcinomas there was no statistically significant association between FHIT methylation and age, gender, smoking history, pathologic stage and p16 methylation. However, FHIT methylation in 125 squamous cell carcinomas was associated with exposure to tobacco smoke and p16 methylation, but not with age, gender and pathologic stage. Hypermethylation of FHIT in squamous cell carcinomas occurred more frequently in current smokers (45%) than in never-smokers (13%). FHIT methylation was significantly associated with p16 methylation in current- and ex-smokers (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively) with squamous cell carcinoma and in patients with pathologic stage I squamous cell carcinoma (P = 0.001). Patients with p16 methylation were 3.74 times [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.62 - 7.95; P = 0.001] more likely to have FHIT methylation in squamous cell carcinoma. FHIT methylation in squamous cell carcinoma occurred at a 4.62 times (95% CI = 1.26 - 34.97; P = 0.02) higher prevalence in current smokers than in never-smokers. No prognostic effect of FHIT methylation was observed in stage I and stage II NSCLCs. In conclusion, hypermethylation of the FHIT gene did not have a prognostic significance in early stage NSCLCs. The FHIT methylation is associated with the p16 methylation and smoking in squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting that FHIT may cooperate with p16 for the development of squamous cell carcinoma of lung in individuals exposed to tobacco smoke.",

However, it is still unclear how this protein is activated in response to this carcinogenic agent. We have shown here that UVC upregulates p16(INK4A) and the phosphorylated form of the protein at the 4 serine sites; Ser-7, Ser-8, Ser-140, and Ser-152. This accumulation of p16(INK4A) occurred through increasing the stability of both forms of the protein. Importantly, phospho-p16(INK4A) showed much higher stability, and UV treatment strongly increased its level in absence of de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, we have shown that the UV-dependent upregulation of both forms of p16(INK4A) is under the control of the protein kinase Atr, which suppresses their UVC-dependent proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, although this degradation is ubiquitin-related for p16(INK4A) through the Skp2 ubiquitin ligase protein, it is ubiquitin-independent for the phosphorylated form. In addition, we present clear evidence that Skp2 is upregulated in ATR-deficient cells, leading to the downregulation of the p27(Kip1) protein in response to UVC light. Moreover, we have shown a preferential association of endogeneous phospho-p16(INK4A) with Cdk4. This association increased following UV-treatment mainly for p16(INK4A) phosphorylated at Ser-140 and Ser-152. Besides, we have shown that Atr regulates UV-related p16/Cdk4-dependent and -independent phosphorylation of pRB and G1 cell cycle delay. Together, these results indicate that p16(INK4A) and p27(Kip1) are key targets in the Atr-dependent signaling pathway in response to UV damage.",

To further explore the involvement of p16(INK4a) in replicative senescence, we constructed a retroviral vector containing antisense p16(INK4a), pDOR-ASp16, and introduced it into early passages of human diploid fibroblasts. The introduction of this construct significantly suppressed the expression of wild-type p16(INK4a). It also imposed a finite increase in proliferative life span and significant delay of several other cell senescent features, such as cell flattening, cell cycle arrest, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase positivity. Moreover, telomere shortening and decline in DNA repair capacity, which normally accompany cell senescence, are also postponed by the ASp16 transfection. The life span of fibroblasts was significantly extended, but the onset of replicative senescence could not be totally prevented. Telomerase could not be activated even though telomere shortening was slowed. These observations suggest that the telomere pathway of senescence cannot be bypassed by ASp16 expression. These data not only strongly support a role for p16(INK4a) in replicative senescence but also raise the possibility of using the antisense p16(INK4a) therapeutically.",

In this study, two isogenic human B lymphoblast cell lines with different p53 status include TK6 containing wild-type p53 and WTK1 with mutant p53 were used and contrasted. Lower levels of p16(ink4A) protein were detected in WTK1 cells than in TK6 cells, which were accompanied by increased DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) gene expression as well as hypermethylation of the p16 ( ink4A ) promoter. siRNA experiments to transiently knock down wild-type p53 in TK6 cells resulted in increase of DNMT1 expression as well as decrease of p16(ink4A) protein. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of mutant p53 in WTK1 cells did not alter either DNMT1 or p16(ink4A) protein levels. Furthermore, loss of suppression function of mutant p53 to DNMT1 in WTK1 was caused by the attenuation of its binding ability to the DNMT1 promoter. In summary, we provide evidences to elucidate the relationship between mutant p53 and DNMT1.

These studies suggest that oncogenic mutations subvert normal development and induce reacquisition of stem-like features. However, no study has described how specific mutations influence the ability of differentiating cell subsets to serve as leukemia-initiating cells and if varying such cellular origins confers a functional difference. We have examined the role of the tumor suppressor gene p19(ARF) in a murine model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and found that loss of p19(ARF) changes the spectrum of cells capable of tumor initiation. With intact p19(ARF), only hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be directly transformed by BCR/ABL expression. In a p19(ARF)-null genetic background expression of the BCR/ABL fusion protein renders functionally defined HSCs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), and precursor B-lymphocytes competent to generate leukemia stem cells. Furthermore, we show that leukemias arising from p19(ARF)-null HSC versus pro-B cells differ biologically, including relative response to drug insult.

The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of tumour HPV status, p16 and p53 expression, and mutations in TP53 in patients with SCCAC receiving (chemo)radiotherapy.;Human papillomavirus DNA was determined using an INNO-LiPA-based assay in tumour tissue of 107 patients with locally advanced SCCAC. Patients were treated with radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy consisting of a fluoropyrimidine and mitomycin C. Expression of p16 and p53 was determined using immunohistochemistry. Exons 2-11 of TP53 in tumour tissue were sequenced.;DNA of high-risk HPV types was detected in 93 out of 107 tumours (87%), all of which overexpressed p16 (HPV+/p16+). Of 14 HPV-negative (HPV-) tumours (13%), 10 (9%) were p16-negative (HPV-/p16-) and 4 (4%) overexpressed p16 (HPV-/p16+). Patients with HPV-/p16- disease had inferior 3-year locoregional control (LRC) (15%) compared with patients with HPV+/p16+ tumours (82%, P<0.001) and HPV-/p16+ tumours (75%, P=0.078). Similarly, 3-year overall survival (OS) was 35% (HPV-/p16-) vs 87% (HPV+/p16+, P<0.001) and 75% (HPV-/p16+, P=0.219). Disruptive mutations in TP53 were found in 80% of HPV-/p16- tumours vs 6% of HPV+/p16+ tumours (P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, HPV-/p16- status was an independent predictor of inferior LRC and OS.;HPV- tumours are frequently TP53 mutated. HPV-/p16- status is a strong predictor for reduced LRC and OS, and alternative treatment strategies for patients with HPV-/p16- disease need to be explored.",

This residual BM injury is mainly attributed to permanent damage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), including impaired self-renewal, decreased long-term repopulating capacity, and myeloid skewing. These HSC defects were associated with significant increases in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of p16(Ink4a) (p16) and Arf mRNA, and senescence-associated β-galacotosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, but not with telomere shortening or increased apoptosis, suggesting that TBI induces residual BM injury via induction of HSC premature senescence. This suggestion is supported by the finding that SA-β-gal(+) HSC-enriched LSK cells showed more pronounced defects in clonogenic activity in vitro and long-term engraftment after transplantation than SA-β-gal(-) LSK cells isolated from irradiated mice. However, genetic deletion of p16 and/or Arf had no effect on TBI-induced residual BM suppression and HSC senescence, because HSCs from irradiated p16 and/or Arf knockout (KO) mice exhibited changes similar to those seen in HSCs from wild-type mice after exposure to TBI. These findings provide important new insights into the mechanism by which TBI causes long-term BM suppression (eg, via induction of premature senescence of HSCs in a p16-Arf-independent manner). ",

MCS-5A effectively induces HL-60 cell cycle arrest at the G(1) and G(2)/M phases through direct inhibition of CDK1 and 4 activity. In addition, elevated expression of p16(INK4a) and a reduction in the level of hyperphosphorylated pRb showed that 3 1V MCS-5A also induces p16(INK4a)-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G(1) phase. Furthermore, apoptotic induction in MCS-5A-treated HL-60 cells is associated with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which, in turn, results in the activation of procaspase-8, -9 and -3, and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In addition, the involvement of p16(INK4a) in this apoptotic induction was demonstrated using A549 cells with a homozygous deletion of p16(INK4a).

By evaluating the molecular pathways of senescence in relation to proliferative potential of primary keratinocyte cultures from young and old healthy donors, and from young patients with inherited defects leading to premature aging, we demonstrated that p16(INK4a) is a reliable marker of both physiological and premature epidermal aging. Analysis of the expression and activity of p16(INK4a) regulators showed that stem cell depletion, reduced proliferation, and p16(INK4a) upregulation in keratinocytes derived from the chronologically and prematurely aged epidermis strongly correlate with Bmi-1 downregulation. In highly proliferative tissues, replicative and premature senescence participate in determining senescent cell accumulation. Our findings demonstrated that Bmi-1 is downregulated in human keratinocytes during both in vitro processes, in parallel with p16(INK4a) upregulation and accomplishment of clonal conversion. When premature senescence was induced by specific exogenous stimuli, concomitant Ets-1 upregulation was also observed. Moreover, Bmi-1 inhibited Ets-1-mediated p16(INK4a) upregulation. Finally, Bmi-1 overexpression reduced p16(INK4a) promoter activity and decreased protein expression in aged and diseased keratinocytes, inducing a delay of clonal conversion and an increase of cell clonogenic ability. Altogether these findings underline a key role of Bmi-1 downregulation in enforcing aging in primary human keratinocytes.",

We also integrate the current models into a unified picture, showing that B23 is essential for stabilizing and maintaining a basal level of ARF in the nucleolus, whereas increasing levels of ARF after oncogenic stress promotes B23 degradation and interferes with B23 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In this way, ARF can be regarded as a parasitic peptide on the B23 molecule, because ARF uses this chaperone for its own survival but also antagonizes normal activities of B23.

Using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting of microdissected parts of basal cell carcinomas, we showed that p16(INK4a) was up-regulated at the invasive front of the majority of basal cell carcinomas with infiltrative growth patterns, followed by ceased proliferation, as well as decreased phosphorylation of Rb. Besides supporting the fact that basal cell carcinomas have an intact Rb pathway, our results clearly indicate that invasive tumor cells change phenotype from a proliferative state to an invasive phenotype.

CARF is upregulated during replicative, oncogenic, and stress-induced senescence. Overexpression of CARF induced premature senescence in normal human fibroblasts that was mediated by upregulation of p53-p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p16(INK4a)- pRB pathways. Knockdown of CARF resulted in mitotic arrest leading to excessive chromosomal condensation, aneuploidy, and apoptosis, suggesting that CARF is essential for cell survival.

To assess the differential expression of these genes in the biologic evaluation of head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC), we analyzed their protein expression in 11 cell lines and 46 primary tumors by Western blotting and correlated the results with clinicopathologic factors. In all cell lines, reciprocal expression between p16 and cyclin-D1 and Rb proteins was noted; p16 protein was detected in one (9%) cell line that lacked Rb and cyclin D1 and was absent in 10 of the cell lines (91%) that expressed both cyclin D1 and Rb proteins. Similar, albeit less striking, results were obtained in primary tumors: 30 tumors (65%) lacked p16 expression, and 33 tumors (72%) and 38 tumors (83%) expressed Rb and cyclin D1 proteins, respectively. p16 and Rb proteins were inversely expressed in 72% of tumors and in all cell lines. Except for gender and age, no significant correlation between protein expression and the clinicopathologic factors was found. Our results indicate that (1) loss of the p16 protein may constitute an early event in the development of these HNSC, (2) the reciprocal expression of p16 and Rb suggests a tight regulatory interaction between these genes in HNSC tumorigenesis, and (3) alteration in at least one of these genes might be required for HNSC development and progression.",

All tumors were additionally stained for the proliferation markers Ki-67 and DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TopoIIalpha). Significant differences between the number of p16INK4a-, p18INK4c- and p21CIP1-positive cases were noted among the 3 grades of meningiomas. p16INK4a- and p21CIP-positive tumors were found to prevail among benign meningiomas, whereas p18INK4c immunostaining was closely associated to anaplastic meningiomas. The number of p16INK4a- and p21CIP-positive cases was significantly lower in the cohort of recurrent meningiomas. In contrast, p18INK4c-positive cases were clustered among recurrent meningiomas regardless of tumor grade. Immunoreactivity of p14ARF, p27KIP1 and p73 did not show any differences between meningiomas of various histology and clinical outcomes. Multivariate analysis revealed that only tumor grade and TopoIIalpha index are independent criteria for predicting meningioma recurrence. Thus, the immunohistochemical assessment of p16INK4a, p14ARF, p18INK4c, p21CIP1, p27KIP1 and p73 expression in meningiomas does not appear to provide prognostically useful information.

Here, we tested multiple functional and molecular parameters indicative of p16(INK4A) activity in primary aged murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We found no evidence that replicative senescence accompanies stem cell ageing in vivo, and in line with p16(INK4A) being a critical determinant of such processes, most aged HSCs (>99%) failed to express p16(INK4A) at the mRNA level. Moreover, whereas loss of epigenetically guided repression of the INK4A/ARF locus accompanied replicative senescent murine embryonic fibroblasts, such repression was maintained in aged stem cells. Taken together, these studies indicate that increased senescence as mediated by the p16(INK4A) tumor suppressor has only a minor function as an intrinsic regulator of steady-state HSC ageing in vivo.",

Demethylation of the p16 (INK4a) gene and expression of the p16 (INK4a) protein were observed using higher doses (10(-6)-10(-7)M) of drug while growth inhibition at lower doses (IC(50)=2 x 10(-8)-4 x 10(-8)M) was associated with RB dephosphorylation and increased expression of p21 (WAF1), but not with induction of p16 (INK4a), or apoptosis. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that RB dephosphorylation and the increase of p21 (WAF1) preceded the induction of p16 (INK4a). The drug induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 and G2/M phases. Antisense experiments demonstrated that the G1 arrest was mediated by transcriptional induction of p21(WAF1). In addition to these observed effects on cell cycle regulatory proteins, decitabine also increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. The G2/M arrest was inhibited by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580, indicating that activation of p38 MAP kinase pathway was required for G2/M arrest. Thus, decitabine inhibited growth by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase mediated by p21(WAF1) and the G2/M phase through activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway.",

The present study was designed to determine the potential utility of p16(INK4a) as a diagnostic marker for CIN and invasive cervical cancer in HIV-positive and negative cervical specimens. An immunohistochemical analysis of p16(INK4a) was performed in 326 cervical tissue microarray specimens. Performance indicators were calculated and compared using receiving operating characteristics curve (ROC)/area under the curve. In HIV-1-negative women, the percentage of cells that was positive for p16(INK4a) expression was significantly correlated with the severity of CIN (p < 0.0001). A ROC curve with a cut-off value of 55.28% resulted in a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive value of 91% and a negative predictive value of 78%. HIV-seropositive women exhibited decreased expression of p16(INK4a) in CIN2-3 specimens compared with HIV-negative specimens (p = 0.031). The ROC data underscore the potential utility of p16(INK4a) under defined conditions as a diagnostic marker for CIN 2-3 staging and invasive cervical cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a key molecule in the regulation of cell cycle progression at the G1-S phase restriction point. Its activity is specifically regulated by p16 (also known as p16/CDKN2A, p16(INK4a), and MTS1), a tumor suppressor frequently altered in human cancers. A specific mutation in CDK4 codon 24 (Arginine to Cysteine) prevents p16 binding and thus inhibition by p16. This mutated CDK4 acts as a dominant oncogene and has been found in both sporadic and familial melanoma. To study the effects of other mutations in CDK4, we generated a panel of 18 CDK4 mutants using Charged-to-Alanine scanning mutagenesis, and investigated the p16-binding capacity of these mutants to identify novel sites involved in p16 binding. The mutant CDK4 proteins were generated by direct coupled transcription-translation in vitro and tested for binding to p16 using a p16-GST fusion protein. Several mutants demonstrated loss of p16 binding. In addition to the previously identified codon 24 mutants, alterations in and around codon 22, 25, 97, and 281 all showed loss of p16 binding capacity. These results indicate that several noncontiguous amino acid sequences on CDK4 are required for binding to p16, which suggests the existence of multiple sites of interaction with p16. Since p16-binding deficient CDK4 has oncogenic potential, these mutations may be present in melanomas or other human neoplasms.",

Transcriptional silencing, as a main consequence of hypermethylation of CpG islands, is the predominant mechanism of p16(INK4a) and E-cadherin gene inactivation in malignant epithelial tumors. This study was conducted to evaluate the promoter methylation status of p16(INK4a) and E-cadherin genes in 22 specimens of cervical carcinomas, four cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa, Caski, C33A), and 20 human papillomavirus negative specimens, obtained from normal cervical swabs, using the methylation-specific PCR approach. Hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island of the p16(INK4a) and E-cadherin genes were found in 13 (59.1%) and 10 (45.5%) of 22 cervical cancer samples, respectively. Furthermore, our findings did not show any correlation between promoter methylation of p16(INK4a) and E-cadherin genes and clinicopathological parameters, including HPV infection, phenotypic distribution, and stage of the disease. However, hypermethylation of E-cadherin gene promoter appears to be age related in cervical cancer, whereas the frequency of aberrant methylation of p16(INK4a) gene promoter is unchanged according to the age of patients. Thus, caution must be made to use these markers in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.

Both cyclin D1 overexpression and P16(INK4) loss of protein produce persistent hyperphosphorylation of Rb with resultant evasion of cell cycle arrest. To better establish the mechanisms of loss of Rb function in neuroendocrine lung tumors, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of the P16(INK4)/cyclin D1/Rb pathway in the spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors, including 34 typical carcinoids (TCs), 25 atypical carcinoids (ACs), 42 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs), and 79 small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs). Absence of Rb expression was not observed in TCs but was seen in 21% of ACs, 68% of LCNECs, and 87% of SCLCs. P16 was expressed in 91% of TCs, 77% of ACs, 78% of LCNECs, and 93% of SCLCs. Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in 6% of TCs, 20% of ACs, 9.5% of LCNECs, and 1.3% of SCLCs. There was an inverse relationship between Rb and P16 in high-grade tumors (P < 0.001) and a direct relationship between cyclin D1 and Rb (P < 0.001) in all tumors, demonstrating that P16 and cyclin D1 act exclusively on the Rb pathway for cell cycle regulation. Overall, the Rb pathway (Rb/P16(INK4)/cyclin D1) was altered more frequently in ACs than in TCs (P = 0.001) and more frequently in LCNECs than in ACs (P = 0.001). Although Rb-negative tumors had shorter survival in the overall group (P < 0.001) as a result of lack of Rb in most SCLCs, cyclin D1 overexpression and P16 loss did not influence survival in any individual category. We conclude that Rb pathway of G1 arrest is consistently compromised in high-grade neuroendocrine lung tumors (92%), primarily through loss of Rb protein, and is intact in low-grade TCs. In ACs an intermediate level of alterations (59%) is seen, consistent with their less-aggressive behavior compared with high-grade tumors. The specific profile of the Rb pathway parameters might provide specific therapeutic targets in neuroendocrine lung tumors.",

Therefore, we introduced a cDNA for p16INK4a into the human glioblastoma cell line T98G, which lacks a gene for p16INK4a. We isolated several clones that stably expressed various amounts of p16 protein. The doubling time of the various clones was generally prolonged. Clones with high-level expression of p16 protein had characteristics of restricted growth, such as contact inhibition, while the parental T98G cells had no such characteristics. Furthermore, the efficiency of colony formation in soft agar was dramatically decreased in the case of cells that expressed exogenous p16.

We successfully used AdEasy-1 vector system to construct recombinant adenoviruses Ad-p14ARF and Ad-antisense EGFR.

This effect, combining Ad-antisense-EGFR with Ad-p14ARF became more noticeable than alone (P=0.01, P=0.02, respectively).

In this study, we demonstrate that p14ARF interacts with E2F1-3 factors to directly repress their transcriptional activities through forming p14ARF-E2F/partner-DNA super complexes, regardless of E2F protein degradation. The inhibition of E2F transcriptional activities by p14ARF in this manner occurs commonly in a variety of cell types, including p53-deficient and p53-wild type cells.

Structural and functional evidence has suggested that homozygous deletion involving CDKN2A (the genetic locus encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(NK4a)) is a mechanism of inactivation of this gene and that it can be a growth suppressor in human gliomas. However, the presence of other potential suppressor genes in the 9p21 region and the relatively large sizes of the deletions has made it difficult to be certain that the CDKN2A gene is their actual target. Here, we tested this hypothesis by determining the growth suppressive effects, cell cycle inhibitions, and the activities of seven naturally occurring glioma-derived CDKN2A alleles carrying point mutations and found that two of them were functionally compromised. To resolve discrepancies among the different existing functional assays, we developed an assay for p16(INK4a) function that allowed us to demonstrate that the expression of wild-type CDKN2A, but not alleles with inactivating mutations, prevents pRB phosphorylation in vivo in human glioma cells. These data suggest that CDKN2A is a critical target for mutational inactivation in human malignant gliomas.",

ISOC2 conserves in different species, and encodes 205 and 210 amino acids in human and mouse, respectively. The expression of ISOC2 in mouse is universal but predominantly in uterus, stomach, and urinary tract system. Interaction between ISOC2 and p16(INK4a) was verified using in vitro pull-down assays and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation. Confocal microscopy studies using green and cyan fluorescent fusion proteins determined that ISOC2 co-localizes with p16(INK4a). Over-expressed ISOC2 is able to inhibit p16(INK4a) in dose-dependent manner. Our data indicated that ISOC2 is a novel functional protein, which is able to bind and co-localize with a tumor suppressor gene p16(INK4a).

In this study, we generated stably transfected NIH3T3 cells that express exogenous p19ARF under the control of a heavy metal-inducible metalothionine promoter. Cells arrested in G1 by ectopically expressed p19ARF contained considerably reduced G1 cyclin dependent kinase (cdk2 and cdk4) activities. The expression of cyclin A (a regulatory subunit of cdk2) markedly decreased, while cyclin D1, the major cdk4 partner in fibroblasts, expressed at a slightly higher level and formed complexes with cdk2 and cdk6 in addition to cdk4. Induction of p19ARF activated p53 by increasing its stability, and allowed the expression of p21Cip1, which bound to all of the cyclin D1-cdk complexes (cyclin D1-cdk2, -cdk4, and -cdk6) thereby inhibiting their kinase activities. p19ARF formed complexes with several cellular proteins including mouse MDM2. The majority of MDM2 was found in the complex with p19ARF, while no p53 was detected in association with p19ARF. Thus, we propose that p19ARF neutralizes MDM2 by sequestration from p53, which results in activation of p53, inhibition of G1 cyclin-cdk activities, and G1 arrest.",

Several malignancies show a reciprocal correlation between genetic alterations of single members of the pRb pathway. Therefore, we determined the frequency of Rb deletions and cyclin D1 alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization as well as 5' CpG island hypermethylation of the p16(INK4A)gene using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 82 individuals with plasma cell disorders. Alterations in at least one of the components of the pathway were found in 75%. Cyclin D1 translocations or amplifications were detected in 14/82 (17.1%), Rb deletions at 13q14 in 23/82 (28%) of the cases, including three (3.6%) homozygous deletions. p16(INK4A) was hypermethylated in 33/57 (57.9%) of the samples. Further analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between cyclin D1 alterations and extramedullar or leukemic myeloma manifestations (P = 0.014; Fisher's test). Whereas Rb deletions seemed to occur alternatively to cyclin D1 alterations, no reciprocal correlation was found between p16(INK4A) hypermethylations and cyclin D1 or Rb locus aberrations. Cyclin D1 locus alterations and Rb deletions were associated with a significantly worse prognosis whereas p16(INK4A) hypermethylation had no impact on survival. We conclude that cyclin D1 and Rb aberrations seem to occur as alternative events in plasma cell malignancies and contribute to clinical course and prognosis. In contrast, although p16(INK4A) hypermethylation is frequent, inactivation of p16(INK4A) seems not to be involved in the pathogenesis of plasma cell disorders.",

In the German series, 52/424 cases (12.3 %) were p16-positive/hrHPV-positive (OSCC 3.8 % [10/265], OPSCC 34.4 % [42/122], HPSCC 0 % [0/37]). In addition, there were 9 cases that were p16-positive/hrHPV-negative (5 OPSCC and 4 OSCC).

In both series, HPV16 was by far the most common HPV type detected. We confirm that regardless of geographical origin, the highest hrHPV prevalence in HNSCC is observed in oropharyngeal carcinomas. The proportion of HPV-associated OPSCC was substantially higher in the German cohort than in the Brazilian series (34.4 vs. 15.5 %), and in both groups, the prevalence of hrHPV in OPSCC was much lower than in recent reports from North America and Scandinavia.

In addition, the seven currently known CKIs qualify as either established or candidate tumor suppressors whose loss or inactivation contribute to molecular pathogenesis of a wide range of tumor types. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a panel of 10 mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that specifically recognize p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) or the individual members of the INK4 family of CKIs: p15INK4b (p15), p16INK4a (p16), p18INK4c (p18), or p19INK4d (p19).

Epitopes targeted by the antibodies were mapped by peptide enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA), and performance of the MAbs assessed in a range of immunochemical techniques. Individual MAbs of our series recognize distinct pools of the respective CKIs, a feature reflected by their differential applicability in immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunostaining including immunohistochemistry on archival paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Together, these antibodies represent useful reagents to study CKIs in cells and tissues, a set of tools that should help elucidate the physiological roles played by the individual CKIs, and better understand the molecular mechanisms of loss or inactivation of these (candidate) tumor suppressors in human malignancies.",

Wild-type marrow was also transduced with vectors expressing either E7 alone or both E7 and CBFbeta-SMMHC. Combining oncogenes again increased leukemia formation. Exposing mice transplanted with CBFbeta-SMMHC-transduced cells to a mutagen, ethylnitrosourea, markedly accelerated leukemogenesis compared to expressing CBFbeta-SMMHC with loss of p16p19, indicating the need for multiple \"hits\" for transformation.

Although p16 deletion has been found in various ovarian tumor cell lines, p16 inactivation by homozygous deletion or mutation has been reported only sporadically in primary ovarian carcinomas. In a comprehensive study, we analyzed p16 protein expression by immuno-histochemistry (IHC) on paraffin sections of 94 primary ovarian carcinomas of different histological subtype. Loss of expression was detected in 19 primary tumors (20%), mainly mucinous and endometrioid carcinomas. To reveal the cause of suppressed expression, we performed (i) analysis of homozygous deletions by comparative PCR after micro-dissection, (ii) mutation analysis by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and subsequent direct sequencing and (iii) methylation-specific PCR to determine the methylation status of 5'-CpG islands. Loss of or weak p16 expression was caused by hyper-methylation (12/19 IHC-negative cases), somatic mutation (10 tumors) or homozygous deletion (1 case). Aberrant p 16 results by one of these methods were detected in 71-79% of endometrioid and mucinous, but in only 10% of serous-papillary, carcinomas. Our data suggest that p16 inactivation is a typical feature of certain subtypes of ovarian carcinoma.",

To determine the role of p16(INK4a) alteration in progression of gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the stomach, we have investigated protein expression and gene methylation in correlation with clinicopathologic factors and survival. In addition to immunohistochemical analysis of p16(INK4a) in a series of 95 cases, real-time quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain reaction for p16(INK4a) and immunostaining for cyclin D1, cyclin E, pRb, DP-1, E2F-1, and Ki-67 were also evaluated in randomly selected samples. The p16(INK4a) labeling indices ranged from 0% to 74% (median, 21%), demonstrating a significant inverse correlation with size (P = .046). On univariate (P = .003) and multivariate (P = .067) analyses, loss of p16(INK4a) expression increased the likelihood of a poor tumor-related survival. In addition, size (P = .036) and the mitotic index (P = .005) had independent prognostic influence. The p16(INK4a) methylation index, which ranged from 0% to 100% (median, 17%), was significantly higher in larger tumors (P < .001) and in high-risk category lesions (P = .001) and inversely correlated with protein expression. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on expression of p16(INK4a) network members identified 2 clusters in 27 randomly selected tumor samples, containing 11 and 16 tumors each. Former cluster samples demonstrated higher risk category (P = .022), higher p16(INK4a) methylation (P < .001), and more reduced pRb expression (P < .018). In addition, p16(INK4a) network members clustered into 2 groups: (1) showing down-regulated p16(INK4a) protein and up-regulating of both cyclin D1 and DP-1 and (2) down-regulated pRb and up-regulated E2F-1. We conclude that p16(INK4a) alteration has an important role in progression of gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the stomach. Furthermore, the study provides a possible link between regulation of p16(INK4a) network members and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",

Frozen tissue samples of 10 benign ameloblastomas and 1 malignant (metastasizing) ameloblastoma were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing to detect p53 gene alteration.;Immunohistochemical reactivity for p53 was detected in 2 of 13 tooth germs, 13 of 29 ameloblastomas, and 5 of 5 malignant ameloblastomas, and the expression ratio of p53 in tooth germs was significantly lower than those in benign and malignant ameloblastomas. Direct DNA sequencing showed no alteration of p53 gene exons 5-8 in any sample of 10 benign ameloblastomas and 1 metastasizing ameloblastoma. Expression of MDM2 and p14(ARF) was detected in all samples of normal and neoplastic odontogenic epithelium, and the expression ratios in tooth germs tended to be lower than those in benign and malignant ameloblastomas. In ameloblastomas, expression of p53, MDM2, and p14(ARF) was significantly higher in plexiform cases than in follicular cases. Markedly decreased reactivity for p53, MDM2, and p14(ARF) was detected in keratinizing and granular cells in ameloblastoma subtypes. Basal cell ameloblastoma showed slightly higher reactivity for p53, MDM2, and p14(ARF) as compared with other subtypes.;Elevated expression of p53, MDM2, and p14(ARF) in benign and malignant ameloblastomas suggests that alteration of the p53-MDM2-p14(ARF) cascade is involved in oncogenesis and/of malignant transformation of odontogenic epithelium. p53 gene status implied that p53 mutation might play a minor role in neoplastic changes of odontogenic epithelium.

While it remains to be clarified how asbestos fibers confer genetic/epigenetic alterations and induce cellular transformation in normal mesothelial cells, the understanding of key molecular mechanisms of MM cell development, proliferation, and invasion has progressed. MM shows frequent genetic inactivation of tumor suppressor genes of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) which encodes Merlin, and epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A. However, no frequent mutations of well-known oncogenes such as K-RAS and PIK3CA have been identified. Activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and MET, and subsequent deregulations of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling cascades are frequently observed in most MM cells. The tumor suppressive function of Merlin in MM cells is also being investigated by dissecting its possible downstream signaling cascade called the Hippo pathway. Further comprehensive delineation of dysregulated signaling cascades in MM cells will lead to identification of key addiction pathways for cell survival and proliferation of MM cells, which strongly promote establishment of a new molecular target therapy for MM.",

In ovarian epithelial carcinogenesis, p16 and p53 show higher immunohistochemical staining frequencies in malignant tumors and are associated with poor prognoses. p14 was only analyzed in carcinomas, with conflicting results. There are no reports on its expression in benign and borderline tumors. This study aims to determine p14, p16 and p53 expression frequencies in ovarian benign, borderline and malignant tumors and their associations with clinical parameters.;A cross-sectional study utilizing immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded ovarian epithelial tumor samples. Clinical data were collected from medical records. Fisher's exact test and the Bonferroni correction were performed for frequency associations. Survival comparisons utilized Kaplan-Meier and log rank testing. Associations were considered significant when p < 0.05.;p14 absent expression was associated with malignant tumors (60 % positive) (p = 0.000), while 93 % and 94 % of benign and borderline tumors, respectively, were positive. p16 was positive in 94.6 % of carcinomas, 75 % of borderline and 45.7 % of benign tumors (p = 0.000). p53 negative staining was associated with benign tumors (2.9 % positive) (p = 0.016) but no difference was observed between borderline (16.7 %) and malignant tumors (29.7 %) (p = 0.560). No associations were found between expression rates, disease-free survival times or clinical variables. Carcinoma subtypes showed no difference in expression.;This is the first description of p14 expression in benign and borderline tumors. It remains stable in benign and borderline tumors, while carcinomas show a significant absence of staining. This may indicate that p14 abnormalities occur later in carcinogenesis. p16 and p53 frequencies increase from benign to borderline and malignant tumors, similarly to previous reports, possibly reflecting the accumulation of inactive mutant protein. The small sample size may have prevented statistically significant survival analyses and clinical correlations. Future studies should investigate genetic abnormalities in p14 coding sequences and include all types of ovarian epithelial tumors. Bigger sample sizes may be needed for significant associations.",

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a) is essential in the control of cellular proliferation, and its expression, in epithelial cells, is associated with irreversible growth arrest. Using long-term cultured CD8+ T lymphocytes, we have investigated the role of the p16/pRb pathway in the regulation of T cell proliferation and senescence. In this study, we describe at least two mechanisms that cause replicative growth arrest in cultured lymphocytes. The first one depends on the expression of p16(INK4a) and is directly responsible for the exit of a significant proportion of CD8+ T cells from the proliferative population. This induced p16 expression pattern is observed during each round of mitogen stimulation and is not related to activation-induced cell death. Importantly, knocking down p16(INK4a) expression allows increased proliferation of T cells. The second one is a phenomenon that resembles human fibroblast senescence, but is independent of p16(INK4a) and of telomere attrition. Interestingly, virtually all pRb proteins in the senescent population are found in the active form. Our data indicate that newly synthesized p16(INK4a) limits the proliferation of T lymphocytes that respond to mitogen, but is not required for the loss of mitogen responsiveness called senescence.",

Diverse cellular stress conditions, e.g., DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogene activation, trigger p53-dependent apoptosis. ARF is a 14-kDa protein encoded by an alternative reading frame within the human INK4a locus that also encodes the p16 protein. ARF induces p53 in response to oncogene activation by preventing its degradation. This ensures the elimination of emerging tumor cells by p53-dependent apoptosis. p53 promotes apoptosis through multiple mechanisms, including transactivation of specific target genes, down-regulation of a distinct set of genes, and transcription-independent mechanisms. This may explain the frequent inactivation of ARF/p53 rather than downstream effectors during tumor development.",

In the absence of Arf, mice are born blind and display a phenotype closely mimicking severe forms of the human eye disease, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV). In this report, we characterize p19(Arf) expression in perivascular cells that normally populate the primary vitreous and express the Arf promoter. Using a new ex vivo model, we show that these cells respond to exogenous Tgfβ, despite being isolated at a time when Tgfβ has already turned on the Arf promoter. Treatment of the cells with PDGF-B ligand doubles the population of cells in S-phase and ectopic expression of Arf blunts that effect. We show this effect is mediated through Pdgfrβ as expression of Arf represses expression of Pdgfrβ mRNA and protein to approximately 60%. p53 is not required for Arf-dependent blockade of PDGF-B driven proliferation and repression of Pdgfrβ protein as ectopic expression of Arf is still able to inhibit the 2-fold increase in the S-phase fraction of cells upon treatment with PDGF-B. Finally, induction of mature miR-34a, a microRNA previously identified to be regulated by p19(Arf) does not depend on p53 while the expression of the primary transcript does require p53. These data corroborate that, as in vivo, p19(Arf) functions to inhibit PDGF-B driven proliferation ex vivo. ",

Cytomorphologic features were included in the analysis. p16 IHC staining was correlated with the results seen in the surgical specimens and with HPV in situ hybridization (ISH). Analysis of different thresholds demonstrated that the threshold of 10% p16 tumor cell positivity had the best overall concordance rate with surgical p16 IHC (κ = 0.650) and with FNA HPV-ISH (κ = 0.714). Applying the recommended p16 positivity threshold for surgical specimens (70%) on FNA materials resulted in low sensitivity (39%) and low negative predictive value (26%). In comparison with p16 IHC in surgical specimens, 6/46 FNA cases (13%) were falsely negative for p16. All 6 cases were associated with necrotic background, two (33%) lacked large tumor clusters, and one (17%) had low cellularity. The recommended threshold for p16 IHC on surgical specimens should not be used in cytology materials. The cutoff value for p16 immunostain in FNA specimens showing best results in our series is 10%.

In rare cases, the presence of cilia in a primary HPV-OPC and their persistence in lymph node metastasis can confound the distinction between a benign and malignant process. Three cases of ciliated HPV-OPCs were identified from the archives of The Johns Hopkins Head and Neck Pathology consultation service. HPV status was determined using p16 immunohistochemistry and high-risk HPV in situ hybridization. All 3 patients presented with a cystic lymph node metastasis without a known primary carcinoma. One metastasis was originally diagnosed as a branchial cleft cyst only to regionally recur 7 years later. In 2 cases, a primary HPV-OPC was found in the tonsil. The carcinomas exhibited both nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium and cystic/microcystic spaces lined by ciliated columnar cells. Both the squamous and ciliated cells were HPV positive. This report draws attention to a novel variant of HPV-related head and neck cancer that exhibits ciliated columnar cells. This variant challenges prevailing notions that: (1) HPV-OPCs are uniformly poorly differentiated cancers; (2) cilia are an infallible feature of benignancy; and (3) presence of cilia is a reliable criterion for establishing branchial cleft origin when dealing with cystic lesions of the lateral neck.

The homeodomain transcription factor MEOX2 is an important regulator of vascular cell proliferation and is a direct transcriptional activator of both p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p16(INK4a).

We compared the ability of MEOX1 and MEOX2 to activate p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p16(INK4a) expression and induce endothelial cell cycle arrest. Our results demonstrate for the first time that MEOX1 regulates the MEOX2 target genes p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p16(INK4a). In addition, increased expression of either of the MEOX homeodomain transcription factors leads to cell cycle arrest and endothelial cell senescence. Furthermore, we show that the mechanism of transcriptional activation of these cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor genes by MEOX1 and MEOX2 is distinct.

To test this hypothesis for human Capan-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, we combined microarray for selected glycosyltransferase genes with 2D chromatographic glycan profiling and plant lectin binding. Major differences between p16-positive and control cells were detected. They concerned expression of beta1,4-galactosyltransferases (down-regulation of beta1,4-galactosyltransferases-I/V and up-regulation of beta1,4-galactosyltransferase-IV) as well as decreased alpha2,3-sialylation of O-glycans and alpha2,6-sialylation of N-glycans. The changes are compatible with increased beta(1)-integrin maturation, subunit assembly and binding activity of the alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin. Of further functional relevance in line with our hypothesis, we revealed differential reactivity towards endogenous lectins, especially galectin-1. As a result of reduced sialylation, the cells' capacity to bind galectin-1 was enhanced. In parallel, the level of transcription of the galectin-1 gene increased conspicuously in p16(INK4a)-positive cells, and even figured prominently in a microarray on 1996 tumor-associated genes and in proteomic analysis. The cells therefore gain optimal responsiveness. The correlation between genetically modulated galectin-1 levels and anoikis rates in engineered transfectants inferred functional significance. To connect these findings to the fibronectin receptor, galectin-1 was shown to be co-immunoprecipitated. We conclude that p16(INK4a) orchestrates distinct aspects of glycosylation that are relevant for integrin maturation and reactivity to an endogenous effector as well as the effector's expression. This mechanism establishes a new aspect of p16(INK4a) functionality.",

From previous studies in mice, senescence, a state of cell cycle arrest, may moderate tumour progression through upregulation of antitumour immune responses. The relationships between senescence and immune infiltrates have not previously been studied in humans. We explore whether a marker of senescence (p16(ink4a)) in combination with low level expression of a proliferation marker (ki-67) relate to T cell infiltrates in CRC, and whether p16(ink4a), Ki-67 and immune infiltrates have similar prognostic value.;Immunostaining of p16(inka) and Ki-67 was performed within a CRC tissue microarray. Nuclear p16(inka) and Ki-67 were categorised as high/low. T-cell markers, CD3, CD45RO, CD8 and FOXP3 were scored separately as high/low grade in three areas of the tumour: the invasive margin (IM), tumour stroma and cancer cell nests (CCNs). results: Two hundred and thirty stage I-III cancers were studied. High nuclear p16(ink4a) was expressed in 63% and high proliferation (Ki-67 >15%) in 61%. p16(ink4a) expression was associated with reduced CD45RO+ cells at the IM (P<0.05) and within the stroma (P<0.05) and reduced CD8+ cells at the IM (P<0.01). A low Ki-67 proliferative index was associated with reduced density of CD3+ cells in CCNs (P<0.01), reduced CD45RO+ cells at the IM (P<0.05) and within the CCNs (P<0.001), reduced FOXP3+ cells at the IM (P<0.001), within the stroma (P=0.001) and within CCNs (P<0.001) and reduced CD8+ cells at the IM (P<0.05) and within the CCNs (P<0.05). Tumours with both a low proliferative index and expression of p16(ink4a) demonstrated similar consistent relationships with reduced densities of T-cell infiltrates. On multivariate analysis, TNM stage (P<0.001), low CD3 cells at the IM (P=0.014), low CD8 cells at the IM (P=0.037), low proliferation (Ki-67; P=0.013) and low senescence (p16(ink4a); P=0.002) were independently associated with poorer cancer survival.;Senescence, proliferation and immune cell infiltrates are independent prognostic factors in CRC.

When the vectors were tested for their ability to inhibit tumorigenicity in a polyomavirus middle T antigen model of murine breast carcinoma, expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitors resulted in a delay in tumour formation that varied from several weeks for the p19 expressing vector to greater than 25 weeks for the p27 expressing vector.

        "Doc_abstract":"p16(INK4a) is frequently altered in human cancer, often through epigenetically mediated transcriptional silencing. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of this gene. To learn more about such control, we initiated studies of proteins that bind to the promoter in cancer cells that do, and do not, express the gene. We identify RNA helicase A (RHA) as a protein that binds much better to the p16(INK4a) promoter in the expressing cells. RHA has not previously been characterized to manifest sequence-specific DNA interaction but does so to the sequence 5' CGG ACC GCG TGC GC 3' in the p16(INK4a) promoter. The Drosophila homologue to RHA, maleless (Mle), functions in the fly for 2-fold activation of male X-chromosome genes. In our experimental setting, RHA induces a similar modest up-regulation of the p16(INK4a) promoter that is dependent upon its sequence-specific interaction. Mle colocalizes with hyperacetylated H4Ac16 on the X-chromosome and some autosomal loci. The decreased binding of RHA to p16(INK4a) in our cells, where the gene is transcriptionally inactive, is associated with decreased amounts of RHA that immunoprecipitate with acetylated lysine antibodies. Finally, we show RHA to be a cellular substrate for caspase-3, which decreases its sequence-specific binding to p16(INK4a) by cleavage of the N terminus. Thus, we have identified a new protein interaction with the p16(INK4a) promoter that involves an important protein for transcriptional modulation. This interaction is decreased in cancer cells, where this gene is aberrantly transcriptionally silent.",

Components of the G1 checkpoint, including retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, cyclin D1 and p16INK4a, are commonly altered in human malignancies, abrogating cell cycle control. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined 79 invasive transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder treated by cystectomy, for loss of Rb or p16INK4a protein and for cyclin D1 overexpression. As p53 is also involved in cell cycle control, its expression was studied as well. Rb protein loss occurred in 23/79 cases (29%); it was inversely correlated with loss of p16INK4a, which occurred in 15/79 cases (19%). One biphenotypic case, with Rb+p16- and Rb-p16+ areas, was identified as well. Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in 21/79 carcinomas (27%), all of which retained Rb protein. Fifty of 79 tumours (63%) showed aberrant accumulation of p53 protein; p53 staining did not correlate with Rb, p16INK4a, or cyclin D1 status. Overall, 70% of bladder carcinomas showed abnormalities in one or more of the intrinsic proteins of the G1 checkpoint (Rb, p16INK4a and cyclin D1). Only 15% of all bladder carcinomas (12/79) showed a normal phenotype for all four proteins. In a multivariate survival analysis, cyclin D1 overexpression was linked to less aggressive disease and relatively favourable outcome. In our series, Rb, p16INK4a and p53 status did not reach statistical significance as prognostic factors. In conclusion, G1 restriction point defects can be identified in the majority of bladder carcinomas. Our findings support the hypothesis that cyclin D1 and p16INK4a can cooperate to dysregulate the cell cycle, but that loss of Rb protein abolishes the G1 checkpoint completely, removing any selective advantage for cells that alter additional cell cycle proteins.",

While cellular senescence arrests the early phase of cell cycle without any detectable telomere loss or dysfunction. ROS is reported to contribute to induction of cellular senescence, as evidence by its premature onset upon treatment with antioxidants or inhibitors of cellular oxidant scavengers. Although cellular senescence is known to be implicated in tumor suppression, it remains unknown whether ROS initially contributed to be cellular senescence in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and their malignant counterparts. To clarify whether ROS induce cellular senescence in NHEKs, we examined the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the expression of cellular senescence-associated molecules in NHEKs, compared to in squamous carcinoma cells (SCCs). Hydrogen peroxide increased the number of cells positive in senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity in NHEKs, but not SCCs. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, especially p16(INK4a) was upregulated in NHEKs treated with H2O2. Interestingly, H2O2 suppressed the methylation of p16(INK4a), promoter region in NHEKs, but not in SCCs. Hydrogen peroxide also suppressed the expression of phosphorylated Rb and CDK4, resulting in arrest in G0/G1 phase in NHEKs, but not SCCs. Our results indicate that the ROS-induced cellular senescence in NHEKs was caused by the upregulation p16(INK4a) through demethylation in its promoter region, which is not detected in SCCs, suggesting that ROS-induced cellular senescence contributes to tumor suppression of NHEKs.

We investigated the prevalence of p16(INK4A) immunostaining by CIN grade and whether overexpression of p16(INK4A) in CIN1 predicts future risk for high-grade CIN in Chinese women. 6,557 Chinese women aged 30-49 years were screened from 2003 to 2005 using cytology and carcinogenic HPV test.

Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting confirmed that EZH2 expression was downregulated in pSUPER-EZH2-transfected cells. Flow cytometry revealed that EZH2 inhibition did not induce apoptosis, but significantly inhibited autophagy. In addition, it significantly increased the expression of the cellular senescence-signaling proteins p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, pRb, and p21, and significantly decreased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1, CDK2, and H3K27me3. Cellular senescence was characterized by a significant increase in the G0/G1 ratio and the restoration of sensitivity to cisplatin in the drug-resistant cells. These findings suggest that interfering with EZH2 expression can inhibit SKOV3/DDP cell autophagy and reverse resistance to cisplatin. The underlying mechanisms could be associated with the regulation of the cellular senescence-signaling pathway. ",

We have found that a 22-amino-acid-long peptide derived from the N-terminal part of p14ARF, denoted ARF(1-22), which has previously been shown to mimic the function of p14ARF, has cell-penetrating properties. This peptide is internalized to the same extent as the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) TP10 and dose-dependently decreases proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 cells. Uptake of the ARF(1-22) peptide is associated with low membrane disturbance, measured by deoxyglucose and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, as compared to its scrambled peptide. Also, flow cytometric analysis of annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) binding and Hoechst staining of nuclei suggest that ARF(1-22) induces apoptosis, whereas scrambled or inverted peptide sequences have no effect. The ARF(1-22) peptide mainly translocates cells through endocytosis, and is found intact inside cells for at least 3 hours.

        "Doc_abstract":"Survivin is an essential component of the chromosomal passenger complex and a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family. It is expressed at high levels in a large variety of malignancies, where it has been implicated in drug resistance. It was also shown previously that survivin is up-regulated during telomerase-mediated immortalization, which occurs at a relatively early stage during carcinogenesis. This study shows that up-regulation of survivin during immortalization of human myofibroblasts is an indirect consequence of the repression of p16(INK4a). Survivin and p16(INK4a) were functionally linked by assays that showed that either the up-regulation of survivin or repression of p16(INK4a) rendered telomerase-transduced MRC-5 myofibroblasts resistant to oxidative stress. Conversely, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of survivin activated caspases and enhanced the sensitivity of immortal MRC-5 cells to oxidative stress. The E2F1 transcription factor, which is negatively regulated by the pRB/p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor pathway, was implicated in the up-regulation of survivin. Using the ChIP assay, it was shown that E2F1 directly interacted with the survivin gene (BIRC5) promoter in cells that spontaneously silenced p16(INK4a) during telomerase-mediated immortalization. E2F1 binding to the BIRC5 was also enhanced in telomerase-transduced cells subjected to shRNA-mediated repression of p16(INK4a). Together, these data show that repression of p16(INK4a) contributes to the up-regulation of survivin and thereby provides a survival advantage to cells exposed to oxidative stress during immortalization. The up-regulation of survivin during immortalization likely contributes to the vulnerability of immortal cells to transformation by oncogenes that alter intracellular redox state.",

The identification of two cell cycle regulators, CDKN2 and CDKN2B, that map to the common region of deletion has prompted the hypothesis that they are critical tumor suppressor genes in this malignancy. However, controversy as to whether these genes are the only or even the most important target in bladder cancer oncogenesis remains. To more clearly determine the effect of these 9p21 alterations, we mapped the homozygous deletions and performed a detailed mutational and expression analysis for CDKN2, CDKN2B and a closely linked gene, methylthioadenoside phosphorylase (MTAP), in 16 established bladder cancer cell lines. Nine of the 16 lines exhibit large (30 to > 2000 kb) homozygous deletions on 9p21. All deletions include at least one exon of CDKN2, eight of nine include CDKN2B, and six of nine include MTAP. MTAP function correlates with the genomic deletions. SSCP and sequence analysis does not reveal any inactivating point mutations of CDKN2 or of CDKN2B in any of the cell lines without homozygous deletions, and all express the CDKN2 and the CDKN2B mRNA as well as the encoded p16 protein. The p16 protein levels vary widely and are correlated with absent pRb expression. We conclude that the 9p21 deletions in bladder cancer usually inactivate the CDKN2. CDKN2B, and MTAP genes but that CDKN2 is the most common target. Other mechanisms for inactivating this gene in bladder cancer appear to be uncommon.",

Three of 17 tumors exhibited MTS1 gene mutations: one tumor exhibited a mutation in exon 2 and two tumors exhibited mutations at the splice site junction of intron 2 and exon 3. Three tumors also exhibited a common base change in the 3' untranslated region of exon 3, which is interpreted as a likely polymorphic variant.

The NS-GFP system allowed us to monitor the differentiation process of normal neural stem/precursor cells by analyzing GFP fluorescence intensity. In tumor-bearing mice, despite the very high frequency of tumorigenic cells, we successfully identified the NS-GFP(+) cells as tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs). The clonal studies conclusively established that phenotypical heterogeneity can exist among the cells comprising a genetically homogeneous tumor, suggesting that this aggressive brain tumor follows the CSC model. Detailed analyses of the NS-GFP(+) brain tumor cells revealed that T-ICs showed activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, which functions in tumor invasiveness.

Although p16 is known not to arrest the proliferation of Rb-negative cells, it is not known whether its presence affects how their cycle progresses, how E2F-dependent transcription is modulated, and whether and how Rb-related proteins are inactivated. We have assessed the relevance of p16(ink4a) for cell cycle progression of these cells. Using SaOS2 osteosarcoma cells as a model, we find that downregulation of p16(ink4a) by RNAi and reconstitution of active cyclin D/cdk4 complexes does not affect progression of the cycle of these cells or expression of E2F-dependent genes. Rb-negative tumor cells can functionally inactivate Rb-related proteins in G(1)/S transition independently of their p16(ink4a) status. Furthermore, Rb-negative tumor cells do not arrest when cdk1, cdk2 or cdk3 are inhibited by RNAi, independently of their p16(ink4a) status, and combined inhibition of these cdks is also not enough to arrest their cell cycle. However, cell cycle progression of Rb-negative tumor cells is sensitive to complete cdk inhibition, as it is arrested by the chemical cdk inhibitor roscovitine and the biological cdk inhibitor p27. These results suggest that, despite their lack of cyclin D-containing complexes, Rb-negative tumor cells, like normal untransformed cells, take advantage of the high degree of redundancy of cdks for their cell cycle progression.",

HPV16/18-E6 oncoprotein is associated with HPV etiology, viral persistence and epithelial transformation. Cell cycle protein p16 INK4a (p16) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cervical carcinomas. The aims of this study were to investigate the expression of HPV16/18-E6 and p16 in uterine cervical carcinomas in Qassim Region--Saudi Arabia, and to relate the results to the established clinicopathological prognostic parameters (age of the patient, educational level, birth control methods, number of pregnancy, smoking status, degree of histological differentiation, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis) The study included 40 specimens of uterine cervical squamous cell carcinomas diagnosed and confirmed by biopsy. Histopathological classification of cervical tumors cases was performed according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Immunohistochemical analysis for HPV16/18-E6 and p16 were carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of cervical tissues using avidin-biotin peroxidase method.

Promoter hypermethylation is widely recognized as a mechanism in the progression of HNSCC, but the extent to which this mechanism is consistent between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors is unknown. To investigate the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in HPV-induced and carcinogen-induced cancers, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in HPV(+) and HPV(-) SCC cell lines. We used two platforms: the Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadArray and tiling arrays, and confirmed illustrative examples with pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR. These analyses indicate that HPV(+) cell lines have higher DNA methylation in genic and LINE-1 regions than HPV(-) cell lines. Differentially methylated loci between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines significantly correlated with HPV-typed HNSCC primary tumor DNA methylation levels. Novel findings include higher promoter methylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes in HPV(+) cells compared to HPV(-) cells and increased expression of DNMT3A in HPV(+) cells. Additionally, CDKN2A and KRT8 were identified as interaction hubs among genes with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(-) cells.

In this study, we found that DDX5 interacts with c-Myc, and harbors essential roles for c-Myc-mediated transcription and its transforming activity. Furthermore, when c-Myc was forcibly expressed, the expression level of DDX5 protein was drastically increased through the acceleration of protein synthesis of DDX5, suggesting the presence of an oncogenic positive feedback loop including c-Myc and DDX5. Strikingly, Arf blocked the physical interaction between DDX5 and c-Myc, and drove away DDX5 from the promoter of c-Myc target genes.

        "Doc_abstract":"To evaluate the role of p16INK4a immunoexpression and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test for the detection of dyskaryotic cells in high-risk women.;This work was a retrospective diagnostic study conducted in the University Hospital of Thessaloniki from January to December 2008. The subjects were women with current or previous HPV infection and current or previous cervical intraepithelial lesion (with or without treatment) or clinical warts. All liquid-based cytological samples were tested for P16INKa and HPV DNA test. The accuracy parameters used for the outcome included sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.;A total of 226 women were included; the mean age was 29 years. Expression of p16INK4a was detected in the cytological samples of 13% of the negative cases, 44% of the cases of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 46% of the cases of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and 78% of the cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. A total of 91 women tested positive for high-risk HPV infection, and 54 of those had p16INK4a-positive staining reaction cells. The concordance between the 2 tests, HPV DNA and p16, was 59% regarding infection-positive cases. Diffuse strong parabasal p16INK4a immunostaining (nuclear score >2) was observed in 17 cases of the abnormal cytological findings (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 2 cases; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 8 cases; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 7 cases). Colposcopy-directed biopsies were used as the criterion standard for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in 91 women. The sensitivity of p16INK4a was 95% and the specificity was 92%, whereas the sensitivity of high-risk HPV was 100% and the specificity was 78%. The positive predictive value of p16INK4a was 71%, whereas that of HPV DNA was 44%.;The findings suggest that p16INK4a immunostaining can improve the accuracy of cytological examination and HPV DNA test and may be particularly useful in the triage of low-grade lesions.",

Recent evidence showed that BMI-1 was highly expressed in neoplastic skin lesions. However, whether dysregulated BMI-1 expression is causal for the transformation of skin cells remains unknown. In this study, we stably expressed BMI-1 in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. The expression of wild-type BMI-1 induced the malignant transformation of HaCaT cells in vitro. More importantly, we found that expression of BMI-1 promoted formation of squamous cell carcinomas in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that BMI-1 expression led to the downregulation of tumor suppressors, such as p16INK4a and p14ARF, cell adhesion molecules, such as E-Cadherin, and differentiation related factor, such as KRT6. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that dysregulated BMI-1 could indeed lead to keratinocytes transformation and tumorigenesis, potentially through promoting cell cycle progression and increasing cell mobility.",

While epigenetic inactivation of the p16(INK4a) gene promoter has been shown to be associated with increased tobacco carcinogen exposure, little investigation of any similar association of homozygous deletion or mutation of p16(INK4a) and tobacco use has been completed. In 177 consecutive NSCLCs, we examined the determinants of p16(INK4a) homozygous deletion and mutation, including the pattern of tobacco smoking and asbestos exposure. We observed that p16(INK4a) homozygous deletion occurred at a higher frequency in never smokers as compared to former and current smokers (p = 0.01). This observation suggested that tumors from these patients might be more prone to DNA deletion events; consistent with this, epigenetic silencing of the DNA double-strand break repair genes FancF and BRCA1 was also associated with homozygous deletion of p16(INK4a)(p = 0.002 and p = 0.06, respectively). Finally, mutation of p16(INK4a) was rare and only occurred in patients who were smokers. Hence, the character of somatic alteration in the Rb pathway (deletion, mutation or methylation silencing) in NSCLC is associated with the pattern of tobacco exposure, suggesting that susceptibility to lung cancer is, at least in part, mediated by the biological mechanism that selects for the character of the induced somatic lesion.",

We applied array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to identify genes and genomic regions with potential role in the pathogenesis of this tumor. Seventeen patients with FS of bone were included in the study. Array CGH analysis was carried out in 13 fresh frozen tissue specimens from 11 of these patients (nine primary tumors and four local recurrences). DNA was extracted and hybridizations were performed on Agilent 244K CGH oligoarrays. The data were analyzed using Agilent DNA Analytics Software. The number of changes per patient ranged from 0 to 132 (average = 43). Losses were most commonly detected at 6q, 8p, 9p, 10, 13q, and 20p. CDKN2A was homozygously deleted in 7/11 patients. Hypermethylation of both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) was found in 1/14 patients. An internal deletion of STARD13 was found in a region with common losses at 13q13.1. The most frequent gains were seen at 1q, 4q, 5p, 8q, 12p, 15q, 16q, 17q, 20q, 22q, and Xp. Single recurrent high level amplification was detected at 4q12, including KIT, PDGFRA, and KDR. No activating mutations were found in any of them. Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of PDGFRA and/or PDGFRB in 12/17 samples. Moreover, small regions of gains pinpointed genes of particular interest, such as IGF1R at 15q26.3 and CHD1L at 1q21.1. In conclusion, our analysis provided novel findings that can be exploited when searching for markers for diagnosis and prognosis, and targets of therapy in this tumor type.",

In this study, we investigated whether methylation of a few specific CpG sites in the promoter region could significantly down-regulate p16 activity in the tumorigenesis of gastric carcinoma. By Southern analysis and bisulfite-modified genomic sequencing of 9 gastric-carcinoma cell lines, we found that the 5 cell lines (55.5%) not expressing p16 mRNA had methylated CpG sites at the promoter region of p16.

Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we have completed a screening test to identify gene expression changes triggered when cells proliferate under stress.

This generalized silencing of imprinted genes is independent of the stress-responsive tumor suppressors p53, p19(Arf), and p16(Ink4a), and it is also independent of the oxidative culture conditions and the stress response known as \"mouse embryonic fibroblast senescence\". In the case of Cdkn1c and H19, their silencing is associated with unscheduled de novo methylation of the normally expressed allele at their corresponding CpG island promoters, thus resulting in biallelic methylation. Finally, we provide evidence for frequent de novo methylation of Cdkn1c in a variety of murine cancer types.

Evidence that the majority of adrenocortical tumors are monoclonal in origin suggests that a progressive accumulation of genetic aberrations, due to activation of protooncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, leads to abnormal cell proliferation through a multistep process. Inactivation of the p16 tumor suppressor gene (p16INK4A), which encodes the cell cycle protein p16, was investigated in a series of 14 adrenocortical tumors. Using 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning the short arm of chromosome 9, we demonstrated that three of seven adrenocortical carcinomas and one of seven adrenocortical adenomas had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within chromosome 9p21, the region containing p16NK4A. Immunohistochemistry showed the absence of p16 nuclear staining in all adrenocortical tumors with LOH within 9p21, and positive staining in all remaining tumors without LOH. In conclusion, LOH within 9p21 associated with lack of p16 expression occurs in a considerable proportion of adrenocortical malignant tumors, but is rare in adenomas.

Because p19INK4D has strong structural and functional similarity to p16INK4A, we have assessed its role as a tumor suppressor. This was accomplished by screening the p19INK4D coding region for mutations, deletions and rearrangements in sarcomas and non-small cell lung cancers. Alterations of the p19INK4D gene were found in samples from five of 67 (7%) patients with osteosarcomas and none were found in other types of sarcomas or in lung cancers. Five osteosarcoma samples had Southern blot patterns consistent with gene rearrangement. These samples included a primary and recurrent osteosarcoma from the same patient; both with the same rearrangement. Four samples had SSCP patterns consistent with sequence alterations, sequencing determined that three were due to silent base changes and apparently polymorphisms. Sequencing the fourth shifted band revealed a one base insertion causing a frameshift beginning with codon 27. In summary, these studies found alterations affecting the p19INK4D gene in a small but significant number of osteosarcomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"Telomere shortening in primary human fibroblasts results in replicative senescence, which can be overcome by telomerase (hTERT) overexpression. However, because immortalization is one of the hallmarks of malignant transformation, careful analysis of hTERT-immortalized cells is of crucial importance for understanding both processes. To this end, we infected WI-38 fibroblasts with a retrovirus carrying the hTERT cDNA and analyzed their proliferative behavior during 600 days [ approximately 500 population doublings (PDLs)] of continuous culture. Growth of three independent mass cultures was uniform for approximately 150 PDLs after telomerase infection, followed by a progressive acceleration of growth in two of three cultures. Expression of p16(INK4A) was significantly elevated in the immortalized cells but gradually disappeared during the accelerated growth phase. This alteration correlated with loss of the contact inhibition response and conferred the cells with sensitivity to H-Ras-induced transformation. In contrast, the p53- and pRb-mediated checkpoints such as the DNA damage response, chromosomal stability and entry into quiescence remained intact, irrespective of INK4A locus expression. Importantly, detailed examination of one of the WI-38/hTERT cultures during the accelerated growth phase revealed overexpression of the c-myc and Bmi-1 oncogenes, as well as loss of p14(ARF) expression. Collectively, our results indicate that although hTERT-immortalized cells behave similarly to primary cells during the first 150 PDLs, long-term growth in culture may favor the appearance of clones carrying potentially malignant alterations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Individuals with inherited cancer syndromes are at significant risk of developing both benign and malignant tumours as a result of a germline mutation in a specific tumour suppressor gene. Tumours of familial origin are a rare event in the head and neck but despite this, they deserve a growing interest. Familial paragangliomas are most of the time limited to the paraganglionar system, but also may be part of different syndromic associations. Since early detection of paragangliomas reduces the incidence of morbidity and mortality, genotypic analysis in the search of SDHB, SDHC and SDHD mutations in families of affected patients plays a front-line diagnostic role, leading to more efficient patient management. Multiple endocrine neoplasias type 1 are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of at least two of the three main related endocrine tumours: parathyroid, enteropancreatic and anterior pituitary. These tumours arise from inactivating germline mutations in the MEN-1 gene. No clear correlation of MEN-1 genotype with genotype has emerged to date, and MEN-1 mutation testing in tumours is not used clinically because it have not implications for tumour staging. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is due to a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. Hallmarks of MEN-2A (the commonest phenotypic variant) include medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. The most central clinical difference with MEN-1 is that the associated cancer can be prevented or cured by early thyroidectomy in mutation carriers. Individuals with neurofibomatosis type 1 present early in life with pigmentary abnormalities, skinfold freckling and iris hamartomas, as result of NF1 gene mutation. Neurofibromatosis 2 is caused by inactivating mutations of the NF2 gene, and is characterized by the development of nervous system tumours (mainly bilateral vestibular schwannomas), ocular abnormalities, and skin tumours. The molecular genetic basis of nasopharyngeal carcinomas remains unknown, but there is evidence for the linkage of these tumours to chromosome 3p. Finally, the high rate of p16 mutations in squamous cell carcinomas and the association of p16 with familial melanoma propose p16 as an ideal candidate gene predisposing to familial squamous cell carcinomas. The elucidation of the cellular processes affected by dysfunction in familial tumours of the head and neck may serve to identify potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.",

The Val59Gly mutation, one of the three different alterations identified among these families, was also detected independently in two kindreds from France and one from Spain. The impact of the Val59Gly substitution on the function of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a), a product of the CDKN2A gene, was assessed by protein-protein interaction and cell proliferation assays and related to potential structural alterations predicted by molecular modeling. Seven microsatellite markers in the vicinity of the CDKN2A gene were used to determine whether the mutation in these families is identical by descent, or represents a mutational hotspot in the CDKN2A gene. Our results show that the Val59Gly substitution impairs p16(INK4a) function, and this dysfunction is consistent with structural predictions. All melanoma-affected individuals tested in the families under study harbor this mutation. Interestingly, the Israeli pedigree includes an affected individual who is homozygous for the Val59Gly mutation. A common haplotype of microsatellite markers has been demonstrated for mutation carriers in all four pedigrees. The Israeli pedigree and one of the French melanoma families are of Moroccan and Tunisian Jewish descent, respectively, and the other families originate from regions of France and Spain close to the Pyrenees. We conclude that the Val59Gly mutation is a major contributor to melanoma risk in the families under study and that it may derive from a single ancestral founder of Mediterranean (possibly Jewish) origin.",

Aberrant expression occurred in 33 (85%) patients in the following frequencies: Rb, 51%; p16(INK4A), 41%; p53, 26%. Thirteen patients (33%) had abnormalities in 2 or more genes. Outcomes were compared in patients with 0 to 1 abnormality versus patients with multiple abnormalities. The 2 groups did not differ in a large number of clinical and laboratory characteristics. The CR rates for patients with 0 to 1 and multiple abnormalities were similar (69% and 54%, respectively). Patients with 0 to 1 abnormality had a median survival time of 25 months (n = 26; 95% CI, 13-46 months) versus 8 months (n = 13; 95% CI, 4-12 months) for those with multiple abnormalities (P <.01). Stem cells (CD34+lin-) were isolated from adult ALL bone marrows and tested for p16(INK4A) expression by immunocytochemistry. In 3 of 5 patients lymphoblasts and sorted stem cells lacked p16(INK4A) expression. In 2 other patients only 50% of sorted stem cells expressed p16(INK4A). By contrast, p16 expression was present in the CD34+ lin- compartment in 95% (median) of 9 patients whose lymphoblasts expressed p16(INK4A). Therefore, cell cycle regulatory gene abnormalities are frequently present in adult ALL lymphoblasts, and they may be important determinants of disease outcome. The presence of these abnormalities in the stem compartment suggests that they contribute to leukemogenesis. Eradication of the stem cell subset harboring these abnormalities may be important to achieve cure.",

In this study, a quantitative assessment of these aspects of reproductive capacity demonstrated relatively mild deficits in p19(Ink4d-/-) males compared to controls. These effects did not dramatically worsen in older males although some seminiferous tubule defects were observed. Following marker-assisted backcrossing into the C57BL/6 background, p19(Ink4d-/-) males did not display defects in testis weights, sperm numbers, serum FSH, germ cell apoptosis, or kinetics of selected meiotic prophase markers.

The cell cycle distribution was studied by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of p21(WAF1) and p16(INK4A) genes mRNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR. The level of acetylated histones in chromatin associated with the p21(WAF1) and p16(INK4A) genes was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.;TSA or NaBu blocked cells mainly in the G(1) phase, whereas 5-aza-dC treatment failed to affect cell cycle distribution. Expression of p16(INK4A) was detected slightly and p21(WAF1) was not expression in SW1116 and Colo-320 cells before treatment.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells designed to conditionally express p16(INK4A) arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle and show increased sensitivity to glucocorticoid- and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 6-induced apoptosis. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism for increased death sensitivity, we interfered with specific steps of apoptosis signaling by expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. We found that alterations in cell death susceptibility resulted from changes in the composition of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins, i.e. repression of MCL1, BCL2, and PMAIP1/Noxa and the induction of pro-apoptotic BBC3/Puma. Interference with Puma induction by short hairpin RNA technology or retroviral expression of MCL1 or BCL2 significantly reduced both glucocorticoid- and FAS-induced cell death in p16(INK4A)-reconstituted leukemia cells. These results suggest that Puma, in concert with MCL1 and BCL2 repression, critically mediates p16(INK4A)-induced death sensitization and that in human T-cell leukemia the deletion of p16(INK4A) confers apoptosis resistance by shifting the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins toward apoptosis protection.",

Amplification of ABL is an exceedingly rare event, with only less than 5 cases reported in the literature. The p16(INK4a) (or CDKN2A) gene on 9p21 is a tumor suppressor gene, and deletion thereof is recently recognized as one of the most common genetic abnormalities in ALL. The authors herein describe an 8-year-old male patient with precursor T-cell ALL harboring both ABL gene amplification and p16(INK4a) gene deletion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using BCR/ABL probes revealed five or more ABL signals, indicating amplification in 51.5% of interphase nuclei. FISH using p16(INK4a) gene probes showed heterozygous p16(INK4a) deletion in 71.0%. On conventional cytogenetic analysis, however, only 10 metaphases were available, which showed the normal karyotype, 46,XY[10], serving no evidence for the findings on FISH. This is the first report of an ALL case with ABL amplification, and the authors speculate that both ABL proto-oncogene amplification and the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor gene deletion have been implicated in leukemogenesis in the present case, although whether the ABL amplification truly contributes to the leukemogenesis or merely an epiphenomenon representing underlying genomic instability remains to be determined.",

ViroChip analysis of 10 pure dVIN samples confirmed the absence of human papillomavirus subtypes or any other virus with the exception of a single sample that showed a weak microarray signature to a porcine herpesvirus. Follow-up PCR testing of the sample was negative for herpesvirus, and in-depth metagenomic next-generation sequencing revealed only sequences corresponding to non-pathogenic viral flora and bacterial contamination. In this study, we demonstrated lack of a virus association in 10 dVIN cases.

Therefore, we examined the correlation of p16 immunocytochemical staining with follow-up biopsy results on ASC-H categorized smears and compared the data with those classified as ASC-US on 105 liquid-based cytology samples.

However, p16 expression did significantly correlate with the presence of SIL (p = 0.002) in ASC-H smears. There was a statistically significant relationship between p16 expression and presence of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or more on the follow-up biopsies in both ASC-US (p = 0.012) and ASC-H (p < 0.001) categorized smears. In ASC-US categorized smears, there was no statistical significance between p16 expression and the HR-HPV viral load (p = 0.091). But there was a statistical significance between p16 expression and the HR-HPV viral load (p < 0.001) in ASC-H categorized smears.

When staining for Senescence-Associated beta-galactosidase activity, described to be specific for senescent cells, we could show that the enlarged cells specifically gave a positive staining reaction. This senescence phenotype was dependent on the continuous expression of p16INK4A since it was reversed upon reintroduction of tetracycline suppression.

The absolute transcript numbers of the following genes were quantified with real-time quantitative PCR assays: CDKN2A (or p16(INK4a)), cyclin family (A1, B1, D1, and E1), E2F1, RB1, BUB1, BUBR1, ETS1, and ETS2. Protein expressions of p16 and cyclin D1 were semi-quantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical study.;CDKN2A gene expression was about fourfold greater in CD than in SCA and NFA. The gene expressions of cyclins D1, E1, and B1, but not of A1, in CD were significantly suppressed than those in NFA. Cyclin D1 gene expression positively correlated with cyclins B1 and E1. The gene expressions of E2F1, RB1, BUB1, BUBR1, ETS1, and ETS2 did not differ between each group. Positive immunostaining for p16 and negative immunostaining for cyclin D1 were more frequent in CD than in NFA; there were positive correlations between mRNA and protein expressions of p16 and cyclin D1. Thus, it is suggested that upregulated CDKN2A with the concomitant downregulated cyclin gene family is partly involved in the small size of ACTH-secreting adenoma.",

Little is known about the signalling pathways connecting oncogenic stimuli to the activation of ARF. Regulation of ARF occurs primarily at the transcriptional level and several modulators of ARF transcription have been identified. Notably, ectopic expression of E2F1 upregulates ARF transcriptionally, and both E2F1 and ARF have been implicated in apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. We have used primary mouse fibroblasts deficient for E2F1, E2F2, or both to determine the possible role of these E2F proteins as upstream regulators of ARF in response to oncogenic stimuli and other stresses. In particular, we have studied the effects of oncogenic Ras and the viral oncoprotein E1A on ARF levels, neoplastic transformation, and sensitization to apoptosis. We have also examined the behaviour of the E2F-deficient MEFs with respect to immortalization and sensitivity to DNA damage. None of the ARF-mediated responses that we have analysed is significantly affected in E2F1(-/-), E2F2(-/-) or E2F1/2(-/-) MEFs, and ARF is upregulated normally in all cases. Taken together, our results indicate that the activation of ARF in response to oncogenic stress can occur by E2F1- and E2F2-independent mechanisms.

Ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a risk factor for the development of GBM. In this study, we systematically examined the contribution of IR-induced DSBs to GBM development using transgenic mouse models harboring brain-targeted deletions of key tumor suppressors frequently lost in GBM, namely Ink4a, Ink4b, Arf and/or PTEN. Using low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to generate simple breaks or high LET HZE particles (Fe ions) to generate complex breaks, we found that DSBs induce high-grade gliomas in these mice which, otherwise, do not develop gliomas spontaneously. Loss of Ink4a and Arf was sufficient to trigger IR-induced glioma development but additional loss of Ink4b significantly increased tumor incidence. We analyzed IR-induced tumors for copy number alterations to identify oncogenic changes that were generated and selected for as a consequence of stochastic DSB events. We found Met amplification to be the most significant oncogenic event in these radiation-induced gliomas. Importantly, Met activation resulted in the expression of Sox2, a GBM cancer stem cell marker, and was obligatory for tumor formation. In sum, these results indicate that radiation-induced DSBs cooperate with loss of Ink4 and Arf tumor suppressors to generate high-grade gliomas that are commonly driven by Met amplification and activation.

To investigate the role of Trop2 in epithelial carcinogenesis, we generated Trop2(-/-) mice, which are viable and possess a normal lifespan. Contrary to expectations, Trop2 loss fails to suppress keratinocyte transformation. Instead, ras-transformed Trop2(-/-) keratinocytes preferentially pass through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and form tumors with spindle cell histology. Furthermore, Trop2 loss renders Arf-null mice susceptible to the formation of biphasic sarcomatoid carcinomas containing both squamous and spindle cell components upon carcinogen exposure in an otherwise skin cancer-resistant strain (C57BL/6). Immortalized keratinocytes derived from Trop2(-/-)Arf(-/-) mice exhibit enhanced proliferative and migratory capacity as well as increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Src prior to transformation. The clinical relevance of these findings was supported by studying the molecular epidemiology of Trop2 in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. This analysis revealed that Trop2 mRNA levels are decreased in a subset of tumors with features of EMT, and total loss of Trop2 protein expression is observed in the spindle cell component of sarcomatoid carcinomas. Therefore, while previous studies have emphasized the potential importance of Trop2 gain of function, these results uncover a role for Trop2 loss in tumorigenesis and the mesenchymal transdifferentiation observed in a subset of squamous cell carcinomas.",

Patients with higher methylation further showed more frequent recurrence as compared with the low-methylation group, and shortened cancer-related survival (Hazard ratio [HR], 3.379; P < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (HR, 3.962; P < 0.001 on multivariate analysis). A significant inverse relationship was apparent between the p16((INK4a)) methylation and immunoreactivity (P = 0.017). A similar tendency was also observed for the methylation status and the mRNA level (P = 0.195).;We conclude that p16((INK4a)) methylation results in transcriptional silencing and defines a group of CRCs with a poor prognosis.",

Here we report that BRAF(V600E) expression in neural progenitors (NPs) is insufficient for tumorigenesis and increases NP cellular differentiation as well as apoptosis. In contrast, astrocytomas are readily generated from NPs with additional Ink4a-Arf deletion. The BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 significantly increased survival of mice after intracranial transplant of genetically relevant murine or human astrocytoma cells. Moreover, combination therapy using PLX4720 plus the Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-specific inhibitor PD0332991 further extended survival relative to either monotherapy.

Paraffin tissue blocks were available in 41 cases. Twenty-three cases (56.1%) exhibited positive p16(INK4A) staining, which was primarily weak to moderate with a generally focal pattern. Polymerase chain reaction assays were negative for HPV DNA in all cases.;In this study, there was a clinical predilection of OPSCC in older women, with most cases occurring in the masticatory mucosa.

To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.",

Our data showed that the complex between the two proteins was located within the nucleolus. In the present work, we have investigated the regions of p14(ARF) involved in this interaction by using targeted point mutagenesis and deletion mutants. A region encompassing exon 2-encoded sequence was required for physical binding of p14(ARF) to Topo I as well as for stimulatory activity of the enzyme. Exon 1 beta-encoded segment was not implicated in the interaction. Moreover, among p14(ARF) point mutants selected for their high conservation among different mammalian species, mutant p14(ARF) (RR87, 88AA) did not stimulate Topo I in spite of its association with the enzyme, suggesting its direct implication in the functional activity of ARF. In contrast, one mutant, p14(ARF) (R71A), was more efficient than wild-type protein to activate Topo I, suggesting that this residue is a key element to modulate Topo I activity. Finally, only ARF-Topo I complexes containing p14(ARF) exon 2 segment were found to be localized in the nucleolus, suggesting that this subnuclear location is linked to the biological function of the ARF-Topo I complex.",

Eleven were p16INKa (p16)-negative. The MTD of CUDC-101-based combination therapy was established at 275 mg/m(2)/dose. Five patients discontinued CUDC-101 due to an adverse event (AE); only one was considered a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), at the MTD. Pharmacokinetic evaluation suggested low accumulation with this dosing regimen. HDAC inhibition was demonstrated by pharmacodynamic analyses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), tumor biopsies, and paired skin biopsies. Paired tumor biopsies demonstrated a trend of EGFR inhibition. At 1.5 years of median follow-up, there has been one recurrence and two patient deaths (neither attributed to CUDC-101). The remaining nine patients are free of progression.;CUDC-101, cisplatin, and radiation were feasible in intermediate-/high-risk patients with HNSCC, with no unexpected patterns of AE.

However, it has been shown that oncogenic ras inhibits growth of primary cells, through pathways involving p53 and the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p19ARF. We have analysed the effect of the ectopic expression of the three mammalian ras genes on the proliferation of K562 leukemia cells, which are deficient for p53, p16INK4a, p15INK4b and p19ARF genes. We have found that high expression levels of both wild-type and oncogenic H-, K- and N-ras inhibit the clonogenic growth of K562 cells. Induction of H-rasV12 expression in K562 transfectants retards growth and this effect is accompanied with an increase of p21WAF1 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, p21WAF1 promoter is activated potently by oncogenic ras and less pronounced by wild-type ras. This induction is p53-independent since a p21WAF1 promoter devoid of the p53 responsive elements is still activated by Ras. Finally, inhibition of p21WAF1 expression by an antisense construct partially overcomes the growth inhibitory action of oncogenic H-ras. Altogether, these results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of ras in myeloid leukemia cells is associated to the induction of p21WAF1 expression and suggest the existence of p19ARF and p16INK4a-independent pathways for ras-mediated growth inhibition.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The tumor suppressor gene p16INK4A is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) and an important cell cycle regulator. We have previously constructed a recombinant adenovirus which expresses p16 (Adp16) and shown that infection in a variety of human tumor cell lines with this recombinant virus results in high levels of p16INK4A protein expression resulting in cell cycle arrest and loss of cyclin-cdk activity. Furthermore, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of wild-type p16INK4A is more toxic in cancer cells which express mutant forms of p16INK4A compared to cancer cell lines containing endogenous wild-type p16. TUNEL assay and DAPI staining following infection of MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells with Adp16 indicate that p16INK4A-mediated cytotoxicity was associated with apoptosis. This is supported by studies demonstrating a decrease in cpp32 and cyclinB1 protein levels and induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage following infection of MDA-MB-231 cells with Adp16. These results suggest that gene therapy using Adp16 may be a promising treatment option for human cancers containing alterations in p16 expression.",
