Targeting ErbBs by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may therefore limit esophageal cancer cell migration. Here, we studied the impact of TKIs on ErbB dimerization, cell signaling pathways, and cell migration in three esophageal cell lines: OE21 (ESCC), OE33 (EAC), and Het-1A (non-neoplastic esophageal epithelium). In OE21 cells, the TKIs erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib slightly affected epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR/EGFR, but not EGFR/HER2 dimerization as detected by in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA). Still, TKIs inhibited ERK1/2, Akt, STAT3, and RhoA activity in OE21 cells, as assessed by Western blot, antibody arrays, and Rho GTPase effector pull-down assays. This was accompanied by reduced OE21 cell migration, induction of focal adhesions, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, as shown by Oris™ migration assay and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/phalloidin staining. In contrast, in OE33 cells, only lapatinib decreased STAT5, Src family kinase (SFK), and FAK activity as well as β-catenin expression. This impeded cell migration and induced morphological changes in OE33 cells. No alterations were seen for the non-neoplastic Het-1A cells. Thus, we identified the ErbB signaling network as regulator of esophageal cancer cell's actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and cell migration. ErbB targeted TKIs therefore also limit ESCC and EAC cell motility and migration.;Clinical tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) reduce esophageal cancer cell migration. Loss of cell migration is linked to reduced Akt, ERK1/2, STAT (3 or 5), FAK, SFKs, and RhoA activity. Clinical TKIs act via distinct signaling in the two main histotypes of esophageal cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are in the focus of targeted therapy for epithelial tumors. Our study addressed the role of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 expression and dimerization in esophageal cancers in situ and in vitro in the context of therapeutic EGFR and HER2 inhibitors. In archival pretreatment biopsies of esophageal carcinomas (n = 110), EGFR was preferentially expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) (22.4%; p = 0.088) and HER2 (34.4%; p < 0.001) with HER3 (91.5%; p < 0.001) in esophageal (Barrett's) adenocarcinomas (EACs). In situ proximity ligation assays revealed mainly EGFR and HER2 homodimers in ESCC and EAC cases, respectively. However, EAC cases also exhibited HER2/HER3 heterodimers. In vitro ESCC (OE21) cells displayed a significant response to erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib, with loss of AKT phosphorylation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. In EAC cells (OE19, OE33 and SK-GT-4), lapatinib was similarly effective in strongly HER2-positive (mainly HER2 homodimers and some HER2/EGFR heterodimers) OE19 and OE33 cells. The HER2-targeting antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) given alone were largely ineffective in ESCC and EAC cells. However, both antibodies significantly induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in EAC (OE19 and OE33) cells upon co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The study reveals that overexpression of EGFR and HER2 predominantly results in homodimers in ESCCs and EACs, respectively. Still, some EACs also show HER2 dimerization plasticity, e.g., with HER3. Such RTK dimerization patterns affect responses to EGFR and HER2 targeting inhibitors in ESCC and EAC cells in vitro and hence may influence future prediction for particularly HER2-targeting inhibitors in EACs.",

Furthermore, we confirmed that cisplatin-induced EGFR activation was inhibited by cetuximab in TE-8 but not in TE-4 cells.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the pan-erbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor CI-1033 against esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. We selected 4 human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (TT, TE2, TE6, and TE10), and determined their expression of EGFR and HER2. We examined the ability of CI-1033 to inhibit cell growth in vitro and in vivo. EGFR and HER2 were overexpressed in all 4 esophageal cancer cells. We found that CI-1033 could inhibit the growth of esophageal cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with the inhibition of phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT. The oral administration of CI-1033 exerted a significant antitumor effect on esophageal cancer tumors in athymic nude mice. Our results suggest that CI-1033 effectively inhibits the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma which co-expresses both EGFR and HER2 with the inhibition of phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT.

This study was to evaluate antitumor activity of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE, a recently developed bispecific enediyne-energized fusion protein targeting both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), on esophageal cancer. The fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE consists of two oligopeptide ligands and an enediyne antibiotic lidamycin (LDM) for receptor binding and cell killing, respectively. The current study demonstrated that Ec-LDP-Hr had high affinity to bind to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells, and enediyne-energized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE showed potent cytotoxicity to ESCC cells with differential expression of EGFR and HER2. Ec-LDP-Hr-AE could cause significant G2-M arrest in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells, and it also induced apoptosis in ESCC cells in a dosage-dependent manner. Western blot assays showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE promoted caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities as well as PARP cleavage. Moreover, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited cell proliferation via decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and further exerted inhibition of the activation of their downstream signaling molecules. In vivo, at a tolerated dose, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited tumor growth by 88% when it was administered to nude mice bearing human ESCC cell KYSE150 xenografts. These results indicated that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE exhibited potent anti-caner efficacy on ESCC, suggesting it could be a promising candidate for targeted therapy of esophageal cancer. ",

To gain insights into how EGFR overexpression affects cellular functions in primary human esophageal cells, we performed gene expression profiling and identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 as the most up-regulated gene. IGFBP-3 regulates cell proliferation through both insulin-like growth factor-dependent and independent mechanisms. We found that IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein expression was increased in EGFR-overexpressing primary and immortalized human esophageal cells. IGFBP-3 was also up-regulated in EGFR-overexpressing cells in organotypic culture and in EGFR transgenic mice. Furthermore, IGFBP-3 mRNA was overexpressed in 80% of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and 60% of primary esophageal adenocarcinomas. Concomitant up-regulation of EGFR and IGFBP-3 was observed in 60% of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry revealed cytoplasmic localization of IGFBP-3 in the preponderance of preneoplastic and neoplastic esophageal lesions. IGFBP-3 was also overexpressed in esophageal cancer cell lines at both mRNA (60%) and protein (40%) levels. IGFBP-3 secreted by cancer cells was capable of binding to insulin-like growth factor I. Functionally, epidermal growth factor appeared to regulate IGFBP-3 expression in esophageal cancer cell lines. Finally, suppression of IGFBP-3 by small interfering RNA augmented cell proliferation, suggesting that IGFBP-3 may inhibit tumor cell proliferation as a negative feedback mechanism.

Proliferation rates among these tumors were similar, but there was reduced apoptosis in the more aggressive H-Ras-driven tumors that also developed aneuploidy and multiple centrosomes. c-Myc overexpression did not result in tumorigenic conversion but introduction of Bcl-XL into c-Myc-expressing cells generated tumors. Although cytokeratin expression was typical of squamous carcinoma, gene expression profiling was done to compare the four different types of engineered tumors with human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Interestingly, c-Myc plus Bcl-XL transformants mimicked squamous carcinomas, whereas H-Ras-, EGFR-, and Akt-driven tumors were similar to adenocarcinomas in their molecular profiles.

Based on a genome-wide association study in a Han Chinese population, we examined 3443 SNPs in 127 genes in the EGFR pathway for 1942 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), 1758 gastric cancers (GCs), and 2111 controls. SNP-level analyses were conducted using logistic regression models. We applied the resampling-based adaptive rank truncated product approach to determine the gene- and pathway-level associations. The EGFR pathway was significantly associated with GC risk (P = 2.16×10(-3)). Gene-level analyses found 10 genes to be associated with GC, including FYN, MAPK8, MAP2K4, GNAI3, MAP2K1, TLN1, PRLR, PLCG2, RPS6KB2, and PIK3R3 (P<0.05). For ESCC, we did not observe a significant pathway-level association (P = 0.72), but gene-level analyses suggested associations between GNAI3, CHRNE, PAK4, WASL, and ITCH, and ESCC (P<0.05). Our data suggest an association between specific genes in the EGFR signaling pathway and risk of GC and ESCC. Further studies are warranted to validate these associations and to investigate underlying mechanisms. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Squamous cell cancers comprise the most common type of human epithelial cancers. One subtype, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and metastasis. Factors derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) create an environment conducive to tumor growth and invasion. Specialized cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the ECM influence tumorigenesis. We have shown previously that the nature and activation state of fibroblasts are critical in modulating the invasive ability of ESCC in an in vivo-like organotypic 3D cell culture, a form of human tissue engineering. Dramatic differences in invasion of transformed esophageal epithelial cells depended on the type of fibroblast in the matrix. We hypothesize that CAFs create an environment primed for growth and invasion through the secretion of factors. We find that fibroblast secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) fosters the ability of transformed esophageal epithelial cells to invade into the ECM, although other unidentified factors may cooperate with HGF. Genetic modifications of both HGF in fibroblasts and its receptor Met in epithelial cells, along with pharmacologic inhibition of HGF and Met, underscore the importance of this pathway in ESCC invasion and progression. Furthermore, Met activation is increased upon combinatorial overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53(R175H), two common genetic mutations in ESCC. These results highlight the potential benefit of the therapeutic targeting of HGF/Met signaling in ESCC and potentially other squamous cancers where this pathway is deregulated.",

In vitro, CDCA induced the production of PGE2 and VEGF in dose- and time-dependent manners, and these effects were attenuated by a selective COX-2 inhibitor, mitogen-activated protein kinases inhibitor, or epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. CDCA-induced COX-2 in the cell lysate increased the secretion of VEGF into the culture medium. In vivo, CDCA markedly enhanced tumor growth and increased vascularization.

We evaluated the antitumor             effects of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which simultaneously inhibits             EGFR and HER2, 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) alone and in combination on esophageal cancer             cells. The antiproliferative activity of lapatinib, 5-Fu and lapatinib plus 5-Fu             was measured by MTT assay and the combination index (CI) values were calculated.             Additionally, cell cycle distribution of lapatinib alone and the combination with             5-Fu were detected by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide             stain were used for analyzing the apoptotic cells after cells were treated with             either agent alone or in combination. The EGFR and HER2 activated signaling pathways             were monitored by western blotting. The combination of lapatinib and 5-Fu synergistically             inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect on             esophageal cancer cells. The potentiation effect of combined treatment was associated             with downregulation of EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways because data from western             blot analysis showed that lapatinib in combination with 5-Fu markedly reduced             the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and inhibited the activation of downstream             signaling molecules, such as AKT and ERK. A significant G1 arrest was also observed             in cell cycle analysis after exposing cells to lapatinib, however, combination             with 5-Fu did not enhance G1 arrest.

So we investigated the mutation status of EGFR and KRAS in Chinese patients with ESCC, and explored their correlations with clinicopathological features. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgically resected tumor samples were obtained from 50 randomly selected Chinese patients with ESCC. EGFR mutations in exons 18-21 were detected by Scorpions amplification refractory mutation system technology. KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13 were detected by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. The correlations between clinicopathological features and the mutation status of EGFR and KRAS were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. In the present study, EGFR mutations were found in 7 (14%) out of 50 patients, including G719X missense mutation (n= 1), in-frame deletion (n= 2), and L858R missense mutation (n= 5). Six (12%) out of 50 patients had KRAS mutations in codon 12. Concurrent EGFR and KRAS mutations were detected in one sample. The presences of EGFR and KRAS mutations were not associated with gender, age, smoking history, cell differentiation, or cancer stage. In conclusion, the incidence of EGFR mutations in Chinese patients with ESCC was higher than that of previous reports, and the incidence of KRAS mutations was not low.

In this pilot study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of concurrent erlotinib and radiotherapy as an alternative treatment modality for esophageal carcinoma patients who are intolerant to chemoradiotherapy. Pathologically diagnosed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients who could not tolerate concurrent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. All patients were treated with concurrent erlotinib and intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Erlotinib was given orally for 60 days (150 mg per day). Radiotherapy (total dose, 60 Gy) was given at dosages of 2 Gy for a total of 30 times. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Toxicities were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). The overall survival, progression-free survival, and local-regional relapse-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Interestingly, the positively stained carcinoma cells were not distributed diffusely, and strongly immunostained cells tended to be localized in areas of severe dysplasia and in microinvasive foci just adjacent to the main invasive carcinoma. However, the deeply invasive front never exhibited positive immunoreactivity. The present findings suggest that phosphorylation of EGFR( Tyr992) may play some specific functional role in esophageal carcinomas besides promotion of cell proliferation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a frequent form of cancer that shows striking variations in geographic distribution, reflecting exposure to specific environmental factors that are still poorly defined. ESCC develops as the result of a sequence of histopathological changes that typically involves esophagitis, atrophy, mild to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and finally, invasive cancer. Genetic changes associated with the development of ESCC include mutation of the p53 gene, disruption of cell-cycle control in G1 by several mechanisms (inactivation of p16MTS1, amplification of Cyclin D1, alterations of RB), activation of oncogenes (e.g., EGFR, c-MYC) and inactivation of several tumor suppressor genes. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17q25 has been linked with tylosis, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome associated with high predisposition to ESCC. Whether this locus is also involved in sporadic ESCC remains to be elucidated. Chronic esophagitis is a frequent occurrence in populations at high risk of ESCC. These lesions often show focal accumulation of p53 protein and in some instances, patches of positive cells in esophagitis area at the margins of tumors were found to contain a mutation in the p53 gene. This observation is consistent with field cancerization in the esophagus and suggests that esophagitis may represent an interesting target for early detection of ESCC as well as for intervention strategies.",

We show that the distribution of RHBDF2 in tylotic skin is altered in comparison with that in normal skin, and immortalized tylotic keratinocytes have decreased levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and display an increased proliferative and migratory potential relative to normal cells, even when normal cells are stimulated with exogenous epidermal growth factor. It would thus appear that EGFR signaling is dysregulated in tylotic cells. Furthermore, we also show an altered localization of RHBDF2 in both tylotic and sporadic squamous esophageal tumors. The elucidation of a role of RHBDF2 in growth-factor signaling in esophageal cancer will help to determine whether targeting this pathway in chemotherapy for this and other squamous cell carcinomas will be effective.",

The differentially expressed genes of the subline and the parental cells determined by gene microarrays were further analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting.;We identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as an invasion and metastasis-related gene of esophageal cancer. SPHK1 was overexpressed in the EC9706-P4 subline with high invasive capacity. Among six ESCC lines tested, KYSE2 and KYSE30 cells showed the highest SPHK1 mRNA and protein expressions as well as the most invasive phenotype. By Western blotting, in 7/12 cases (58%), SPHK1 expression was higher in esophageal carcinomas than in the companion normal tissue. In 23/30 cases (76%), SPHK1 protein expression was upregulated in the tumors compared to matched normal tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Esophageal carcinoma tissue microarray analysis indicated that SPHK1 expression correlated with the depth of tumor invasion (P < 0.0001) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.016). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, strong SPHK1 expression was significantly associated with clinical failure (P < 0.01), suggesting the involvement of SPHK1 in aggressiveness of human esophageal carcinoma. SPHK1 overexpression significantly increased the invasiveness of EC9706 cells in vitro and also increased EC9706 cell growth and spontaneous metastasis in vivo, promoting significant increases in tumor growth, tumor burden and spontaneous lung metastasis in nude mice. SPHK1 expression significantly correlated with the expression of many EGFR pathway genes associated with invasion of cancer cells. SPHK1 protein expression also significantly correlated with the phosphorylation of EGFR.;In summary, our data implicate SPHK1 in the metastasis of esophageal cancer. Our study also identified downstream mediators of SPHK1 in esophageal cancer cells that may mediate enhanced malignant behavior, and several of these mediators may be useful as therapeutic targets.",

We used human esophageal epithelial cells as a platform to recapitulate esophageal squamous cell cancer, thereby providing insights into the molecular pathogenesis of squamous cell cancers in general. This was achieved through the retroviral-mediated transduction into normal, primary human esophageal epithelial cells of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT), and p53(R175H), genes that are frequently altered in human esophageal squamous cell cancer. These cells demonstrated increased migration and invasion when compared with control cells. When these genetically altered cells were placed within the in vivo-like context of an organotypic three-dimensional (3D) culture system, the cells formed a high-grade dysplastic epithelium with malignant cells invading into the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM). The invasive phenotype was in part modulated by the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Using pharmacological and genetic approaches to decrease MMP-9, invasion into the underlying ECM could be suppressed partially. In addition, tumor differentiation was influenced by the type of fibroblasts within the stromal ECM. To that end, fetal esophageal fibroblasts fostered a microenvironment conducive to poorly differentiated invading tumor cells, whereas fetal skin fibroblasts supported a well-differentiated tumor as illustrated by keratin \"pearl\" formation, a hallmark feature of well-differentiated squamous cell cancers. When inducible AKT was introduced into fetal skin esophageal fibroblasts, a more invasive, less-differentiated esophageal cancer phenotype was achieved. Invasion into the stromal ECM was attenuated by genetic knockdown of AKT1 as well as AKT2. Taken together, alterations in key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in esophageal epithelial cells, the composition and activation of fibroblasts, and the components of the ECM conspire to regulate the physical and biological properties of the stroma.",

These cell surface receptors were discovered in the context of cellular transformation and have subsequently been found to be overexpressed in many types of human cancer. Cumulative evidence suggests that upregulation of the most well-characterized receptor, erbB1, also known as the epidermal growth factor receptor, plays a significant role in the development and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A variety of strategies have been developed that specifically target epidermal growth factor receptor, including monoclonal antibodies, ligand-linked immunotoxins, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antisense approaches. Epidermal growth factor receptor blockade in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and preclinical animal models inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth. Clinical trials are under way to test the safety and efficacy of many of these targeting strategies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Encouraging preliminary results combining an epidermal growth factor receptor targeting approaches with chemotherapy or radiotherapy suggest that interference with this growth factor receptor may enhance antitumor efficacy of standard therapies.

In the past 30 years we have witnessed some interesting shifts in terms of epidemiology of esophago gastric cancers. Regardless of a world region, the majority of patients diagnosed with esophageal or gastric cancers die from progression or recurrence of their disease. While there are many active cytotoxic agents for esophageal and stomach cancers, their impact on the disease course has been modest at best. Median survival for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer is still less than a year. Therefore, novel strategies, based on our understanding of biology and genetics, are desperately needed. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway has been implicated in pathophysiology of many epithelial malignancies, including esophageal and stomach cancers. EGFR inhibitors, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have been explored in patients with esophageal and gastric cancers. It appears that tumors of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) may be more sensitive to EGFR blockade than distal gastric adenocarcinomas. Investigations looking into potential molecular predictors of sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors for patients with esophageal and GEJ cancers are ongoing. While we are still searching for those predictors, it is clear that they will be different from ones identified in lung and colorectal cancers. Further development of EGFR inhibitors for esophageal and GEJ cancers should be driven by better understanding of EGFR pathway disregulation that drives cancer progression in a sensitive patient population.",

We investigated the antitumor effects of ZD1839 alone or in combination with TRAIL against human esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) lines. Although all ESCC cells expressed EGF receptor at a protein level, the effect of ZD1839 on cell growth did not correlate with the level of EGFR expression and phosphorylation of EGF receptor protein in ESCC lines.

We hypothesized that leptin may have biological effects in promoting esophageal adenocarcinoma and examined the effects of leptin on the OE33 Barrett's-derived EAC line. Proliferation was assessed by dimethylthiazoldiphenyltetra-zoliumbromide and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays and apoptosis by ELISA of intracellular nucleosomes. Intracellular signaling was examined using specific pharmacological inhibitors and direct detection of phosphorylated active kinases. Expression of the long and short leptin receptors by OE33 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Leptin stimulated OE33 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited apoptosis. These effects were dependent on cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and replicated by adding prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The effects of PGE2 and leptin were abolished by the EP-4 antagonist AH23848. ERK, p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt, and Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-2 were activated upstream of COX-2 induction, whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) were downstream of COX-2. The activation of ERK and Akt but not p38 MAPK was JAK2 dependent. PGE2 stimulated phosphorylation of JNK in an EGF receptor-dependent manner, and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor required protein kinase C, src, and matrix metalloproteinase activities. We conclude that leptin stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in OAC cells via ERK, p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt, and JAK2-dependent activation of COX-2 and PGE2 production. Subsequent PGE2-mediated transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and JNK activation are essential to the leptin effects.

The clinical data of 16 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients, aged >70 years, who were initially treated with nimotuzumab combined with RT, were collected and retrospectively reviewed. The overall response and treatment toxicity were analyzed using SPSS software. All the patients completed the treatment schedule. The response to treatment was assessed at treatment completion and reassessed after 1-2 months: 1 patient achieved complete response (CR), 10 patients achieved partial response (PR), 4 patients exhibited stable disease and 1 patient developed disease progression and succumbed to radiation pneumonitis (RP) 1 month later. The overall response rate (CR+PR) was 68.8%. All 16 patients experienced grade 1-2 radiation esophagitis; no grade 3-4 toxicities were reported. There was one case of treatment-related mortality due to RP during the study. One patient developed a rash on the forearm. No hematological, gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal toxicities were observed. In conclusion, the toxicity of combined nimotuzumab with RT in elderly patients with esophageal cancer was tolerable. However, due to limitations associated with the retrospective nature of this study, the limited number of enrolled cases and the epidermal growth factor receptor expression determination prior to treatment, the efficacy of this treatment modality requires further investigation.",

KYSE-150R cells were pretreated with or without nimotuzumab before ionizing radiation. Cell growth and colony formation were measured to quantitate the effects of radiation.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization with DNA probes for the centromeric region of chromosome 7 and the locus-specific regions of 7p12 (EGFR), 8q24 (c-myc), and 20q13 was applied on 99 brush cytology specimens of patients with Barrett's esophagus with different stages of dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Gains (3-4 copies) of chromosome 17, 8q24 (c-myc), and 20q.13 loci were found in the low frequencies in nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus. Their frequencies increased with the stage of dysplasia and reached a high incidence in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Amplification (>4 copies) of at least 1 of the loci was observed in 14% of high-grade dysplasia and increased to 50% in esophageal adenocarcinoma (P = 0.015). The most frequently amplified locus was c-myc (18%), followed by 20q13 (13%) and EGFR (11%) in the high-grade dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma cases. High amplification levels (>10 copies) of the loci were more frequent in esophageal adenocarcinoma (72%) compared with high-grade dysplasia (20%; P = 0.049). Amplifications of the c-myc, EGFR, and 20q12 loci may serve as diagnostic markers to identify patients with Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma.

The long-term survival of patients with this cancer remains poor; only 25% of patients undergoing surgical excision are alive after 5 years. Multimodal programs that incorporate radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery for localized tumors may result in a modest survival advantage. However, significant strides in this disease can result from the inclusion of targeted therapies. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family represents one such target and is receiving increasing attention due to the advent of specific inhibitors. Studies conducted by us and others have shown that the overexpression of EGFR family signaling intermediates is common in Barrett's esophagus and EAC. In the latter case, EGFR expression may have prognostic significance. EGFR inhibitors, including oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, result in a synergistic antitumor effect with chemotherapeutic agents or with radiotherapy. Therefore, several ongoing studies include EGFR-directed therapy either alone or in combination with chemoradiotherapy for this disease. Our study of gefitinib, oxaliplatin and radiotherapy suggested that gefitinib can be safely incorporated into an oxaliplatin-based chemoradiation program for esophageal cancer, although the clinical activity of this combination is modest.

Immunohistochemistry revealed that EGFR protein is overexpressed in 53 (50%) of the 106 ESCC examined. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated clear EGFR gene amplification in 15 of the 53 tumors, somewhat higher EGFR copy in 32 cases, and no increase in 6 cases. Gene amplification was significantly associated with high level overexpression. Direct sequencing of exons 19 and 21 of EGFR revealed no mutations in 15 tumors exhibiting gene amplification, and no mutations in 25 tumors not exhibiting gene amplification. Overexpression of EGFR was significantly correlated with depth of invasion of the tumor. In conclusion, anti-EGFR therapies may be appropriate for patients with ESCC.

The aim of the present study, therefore, was to develop an immunohistochemistry-based prognostic model to improve clinical risk assessment for patients with ESCC.;We developed a molecular prognostic model based on the combined expression of axis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphorylated Specificity protein 1 (p-Sp1), and Fascin proteins. The presence of this prognostic model and associated clinical outcomes were analyzed for 130 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal curative resection specimens (generation dataset) and validated using an independent cohort of 185 specimens (validation dataset).;The expression of these three genes at the protein level was used to build a molecular prognostic model that was highly predictive of ESCC survival in both generation and validation datasets (P = 0.001). Regression analysis showed that this molecular prognostic model was strongly and independently predictive of overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.358 [95% CI, 1.391-3.996], P = 0.001 in generation dataset; hazard ratio = 1.990 [95% CI, 1.256-3.154], P = 0.003 in validation dataset).

Deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and aberrant expression of its components is commonly observed in solid tumors. Such aberrant regulation of Wnt signaling is commonly related to either malfunction of its components or crosstalk with other cellular processes such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling cascade. Therefore, identification of the roles of major involved components may be useful to identify new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In this study, we assessed EGFR and PYGO2 mRNA expression in tumors and margin normal tissues from 55 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients using real-time qRT-PCR, and evaluated clinicopathology relative to the two genes' expression levels. Significant PYGO2 and EGFR overexpression was observed in 30.9 % (P = 0.017) and 38.2 % (P = 0.006) of tumors, respectively. PYGO2 and EGFR expression were significantly associated not only with each other (P < 0.001), but also with tumor staging and depth (P < 0.001). Furthermore, PYGO2 expression was significantly correlated with the tumor grade (P = 0.043) and size (P = 0.023). We identify PYGO2 as a new molecular marker of invasive tumors, introducing its probable oncogenic role in ESCC progression and aggressiveness. In line with other reports, we also illustrate the oncogenic function of EGFR in the development of ESCC through advance stages. We also observed a significant correlation between PYGO2 and EGFR in ESCC tumors, which reveals a mutual convergent influence of these factors in tumor progression and development. Considering aberrant expression, mutual positive feedback, and the significant clinical relevance of these genes in ESCC, we introduce them as appropriate therapeutic targets in adjuvant therapy of ESCC.",

Blockade of EGFR signal transduction can be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Approximately 40-70% of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) show high expression of EGFR. In this study, we examined the antitumor effect of gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, against ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. In three ESCC cell lines (TE8, T.T and T.Tn), cell proliferation had been inhibited in a dose-dependent manner and IC(50) values (respectively, 8.49, 18.9 and 17.3muM). Gefitinib inhibited EGF-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt, and caused G(1) arrest of cell cycle and apoptosis confirmed with flow cytometry. We examined the effect of gefitinib on nude mice bearing established TE8 and T.T xenografts. Gefitinib (100 or 200mg/kg once-daily, p.o.) showed antitumor activity in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a significantly improved survival of treated mice as compared with untreated mice. Immunohistochemical examination of the harvested tumor was performed to examine the status of phosphorylated EGFR, PCNA, Factor VIII and apoptosis. We found inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest (by PCNA staining), decrease of microvessel density (Factor VIII) and induction of apoptosis by TUNEL staining. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that gefitinib is effective for growth inhibition of ESCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo and suggest that gefitinib may be one of the new therapeutic options for ESSC.",

We conducted a large-scale genomic analysis of ESCCs from patients in Japan to determine the mutational landscape of this cancer.;We performed whole-exome sequence analysis of tumor and nontumor esophageal tissues collected from 144 patients with ESCC who underwent surgery at 5 hospitals in Japan. We also performed single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based copy number profile and germline genotype analyses of polymorphisms in ADH1B and ALDH2. Polymorphisms in CYP2A6, which increase harmful effects of smoking, were analyzed. Functions of TET2 mutants were evaluated in KYSE410 and HEK293FT cells.;A high proportion of mutations in the 144 tumor samples were C to T substitution in CpG dinucleotides (called the CpG signature) and C to G/T substitutions with a flanking 5' thymine (called the APOBEC signature). Based on mutational signatures, patients were assigned to 3 groups, which associated with environmental (drinking and smoking) and genetic (polymorphisms in ALDH2 and CYP2A6) factors. Many tumors contained mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle (TP53, CCND1, CDKN2A, FBXW7); epigenetic processes (MLL2, EP300, CREBBP, TET2); and the NOTCH (NOTCH1, NOTCH3), WNT (FAT1, YAP1, AJUBA) and receptor-tyrosine kinase-phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways (PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2). Mutations in EP300 and TET2 correlated with shorter survival times, and mutations in ZNF750 associated with an increased number of mutations of the APOBEC signature. Expression of mutant forms of TET2 did not increase cellular levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in HEK293FT cells, whereas knockdown of TET2 increased the invasive activity of KYSE410 ESCC cells. Computational analyses associated the mutations in NFE2L2 we identified with transcriptional activation of its target genes.;We associated environmental and genetic factors with base substitution patterns of somatic mutations and provide a registry of genes and pathways that are disrupted in ESCCs.

The median follow-up time in the final analysis was 46 months. The high-dose group showed no increased incidence of toxicities compared to the low-dose group. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year overall survival rates in the low-dose and high-dose groups were 66.9%, 50.0%, 31.5% and 90.0%, 80.0%, 66.7%, respectively (P=0.04). Multivariate analyses showed that the high-dose group had better survival than the low-dose group (hazard ratio 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.94, P=0.039). Taken together, high-dose h-R3 showed limited toxicity and improved survival in patients with ESCC. ",

This study evaluates the role of clinical and cellular markers in predicting CR and OS in patients with esophageal cancer.;Patients were treated with infusional cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil combined with daily radiotherapy followed by esophagectomy. Pretreatment tumors (n = 54) were analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), bax, and bcl-2 expression by immunohistochemistry and for p53 mutations by direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8. Clinical covariates included patients' age at enrollment; gender; Barrett's metaplasia; and tumor location, histology, and differentiation. Logistic regression and survival analyses were used to evaluate the predictors.;Age ranged from 32 to 75 years; most patients were male (45 male; 9 female); and tumors were distal (47 distal; 7 mid), adenocarcinoma (41 adenocarcinomas; 13 squamous cell carcinomas), and moderately differentiated (33 moderate; 6 well; 15 poor). Female gender predicted CR (odds ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-41). The OS was 43% at 5 years. Presence of CR (P < 0.001 log rank) and p53 mutation (P = 0.051 log rank) correlated with increased OS, whereas increased EGF-R expression predicted poor OS (P = 0.009 log rank). EGF-R remained significant when adjusted for clinical covariates. There was a trend toward increased OS related to better tumor differentiation and decreased bcl-2.;These data suggest that EGF-R and p53 mutation may be used as both outcome predictors and targets for molecular therapy for esophageal cancer.",

For this reason we evaluated reverse transcription intron differential polymerase chain reaction (RTIDPCR) as an assay of EGFR gene expression. Squamous cell carcinoma (A431 and SiHa), transitional cell carcinoma (HT1376, T24, RT4), mammary (MCF7) and endocervical (HeLa) adenocarcinoma, and leukemia (K562) cell lines were used to compare RTIDPCR and RLBA. RTIDPCR involved reverse transcription of RNA and amplification of cDNA using primers for beta-actin and EGFR. Good agreement was observed between the RLBA and RTIDPCR results. RNA extracted from fresh cells, Diff-Quik-stained smears and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell pellet sections yielded similar results.

Pyrosequencing is a nonelectrophoretic nucleotide extension sequencing technology that can be used for mutation testing.;The frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations was examined using a nonbiased database of 203 resected ESCCs and a high-throughput pyrosequencing assay.;The validity of the KRAS pyrosequencing method was initially demonstrated by detection of all 4 types of KRAS mutations [c.35G>T (codon 12 GGT>GTT), c.35G>A (codon 12 GGT>GAT), c.34G>T (codon 12 GGT>TGT), c.38G>A mutation (codon 13 GGC>GAC)], which had been previously diagnosed using Scorpion-ARMS technology, in 9 colon cancer tissues (9 of 9; 100 %). Similar results were demonstrated for BRAF mutational status in 3 colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, Colo201, and HT29), which were validated by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Subsequently, the KRAS mutation was found to be extremely rare (1 of 203; 0.5 %), and the BRAF mutation was absent (0 of 203; 0 %), in the dataset of 203 ESCCs.;These results suggest that KRAS and BRAF mutations play a limited role in the development of ESCC and that mutation analysis is not useful as a screening test for sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy in ESCC.",

Re-expression of NID2 suppresses clonogenic survival and migration abilities of transduced NPC and ESCC cells. We showed that NID2 significantly inhibits liver metastasis.

Six patients had lymph node metastasis, in four the metastatic carcinoma exhibited basaloid components. Histologically, all the tumors displayed a biphasic pattern of basaloid and squamous components. The former predominated in three cases, the latter in four cases. All the tumors contained solid growth of basaloid cells with microcystic patterns and stromal hyalinosis as well as palisading of cells. Ultrastructurally, markedly replicated basement membrane was observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed staining with only CK 14 and CK 19 antibodies in the periphery of the basaloid tumor nests. These antibodies were also positive in the basal layer of normal esophagus. Diffuse immunoreactivity for EGFR was demonstrated in all the tumors. Five tumors displayed p53 nuclear immunoreactivity.

Overexpression of each receptor may lead to cell transformation and contributes to tumor progression in various malignancies. Although these factors have been analyzed in many cancers separately, little is known about their concomitant expression in esophageal cancer. Based on the finding that EGF-R and c-erbB-2 form highly active transmembranous heterodimers that enhance cell growth and proliferation, we used Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry to analyze the concomitant expression of EGF-R, c-erbB-2, and c-erbB-3 in tissue samples obtained from 39 patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Northern blot analysis revealed a fourfold increase (p < 0.01) in EGF-R mRNA levels in the esophageal cancer samples in comparison with normal tissue samples. The c-erbB-2 receptor was only 1.25-fold elevated in the esophageal cancers, which failed to be statistically significant (p = 0.31). In contrast, c-erbB-3 mRNA levels were 3.5-fold lower (p < 0.01) in the esophageal cancers than in the normal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed weak EGF-R, c-erbB-2, and c-erbB-3 immunostaining in the normal esophageal tissue. In esophageal cancer samples, immunoreactivity for EGF-R, c-erbB-2, and c-erbB-3 was mainly located in the cancer cells. Strong EGF-R, c-erbB-2, and c-erbB-3 immunoreactivity was present in 59%, 64%, and 64% of the esophageal cancer samples, respectively. In consecutive tissue sections, identical cancer cell clusters often exhibited these three closely related receptors simultaneously. However, correlation of the immunohistochemical findings with the clinicopathologic patient parameters revealed that the presence of EGF-R, c-erbB-2, or c-erbB-3 had no influence on patient survival (p > 0.05). In addition, the simultaneous presence of these receptors did not influence survival.

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Trastuzumab in patient-derived esophageal squamous cell carcinoma xenograft (PDECX) mouse models.;PDECX models were established by implanting patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues into immunodeficient (SCID/nude) mice. HER-2 gene copy number (GCN) and protein expression were determined in xenograft tissues and corresponding patient EC samples by FISH and IHC analysis. Trastuzumab anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated within these PDECX models (n = 8 animals/group). Furthermore, hotspot mutations of EGFR, K-ras, B-raf and PIK3CA genes were screened for in the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues. Similarity between the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissue was confirmed by histology, morphology, HER-2 GCN and mutation.;None of the PDECX models (or their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues) harbored HER-2 gene amplification. IHC staining showed HER-2 positivity (IHC 2+) in 2 PDECX models and negativity in 3 PDECX models. Significant tumor regression was observed in the Trastuzumab-treated EC044 HER-2 positive model (IHC 2+). A second HER-2 positive (IHC 2+) model, EC039, harbored a known PIK3CA mutation and showed strong activation of the AKT signaling pathway and was insensitive to Trastuzumab treatment, but could be resensitised using a combination of Trastuzumab and AKT inhibitor AZD5363. In summary, we established 5 PDECX mouse models and demonstrated tumor regression in response to Trastuzumab treatment in a HER-2 IHC 2+ model, but resistance in a HER-2 IHC 2+/PIK3CA mutated model.;This study demonstrates Trastuzumab-induced tumor regressions in HER-2 positive tumors, and highlights PIK3CA mutation as a potential resistance mechanism to Trastuzumab treatment in pre-clinical patient-derived EC xenograft models.",

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, or HER1) belongs to the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family. HER1-mediated cell signaling has been shown to play a major role in promoting tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and evasion of apoptosis. Over-expression of HER1 is observed in multiple human malignancies, including colorectal, lung, breast and pancreatic cancers. In pancreatic carcinoma, over-expression of HER1 is observed in greater than 70% of patients and is associated with a poor prognosis and a significant decrease in survival. Cetuximab (Erbitux) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the extracellular domain of the HER1 molecule preventing ligand binding and promoting internalization and subsequent degradation of the HER1 receptor. Cetuximab has shown anti-tumor activity either alone or in combination with other agents and is currently FDA approved for use in both squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and colorectal carcinoma. Research efforts continue to elucidate a possible role for cetuximab in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Despite promising preclinical work, phase II and phase III clinical trials have failed to consistently show efficacy of cetuximab treatment in advanced pancreatic cancer either alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents.

However, RA and HPR treatment did result in the downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is known to bind key proproliferative ligands, such as epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor alpha.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There exists a highly tumorigenic subset of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells defined by high expression of CD44. A novel therapy targeting these cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is needed to improve prognosis of ESCC. CSCs of ESCC have a mesenchymal phenotype and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical to enrich and maintain CSCs. EGFR, frequently overexpressed in ESCC, has pivotal roles in EMT induced by TGF-β in invasive fronts. Thus, EMT in invasive fronts of ESCC might be important for CSCs and EGFR could be a target of a novel therapy eliminating CSCs. However, effects of EGFR inhibitors on CSCs in ESCC have not been fully examined. EGFR inhibitors, erlotinib and cetuximab, significantly suppressed enrichment of CSCs via TGF-β1-mediated EMT. Importantly, EGFR inhibitors sharply suppressed ZEB1 that is essential for EMT in ESCC. Further, EGFR inhibitors activated Notch1 and Notch3, leading to squamous cell differentiation. EGFR inhibition may suppress expression of ZEB1 and induce differentiation, thereby blocking EMT-mediated enrichment of CSCs. In organotypic 3D culture, a form of human tissue engineering, tumor cells in invasive nests showed high expression of CD44. Erlotinib significantly blocked invasion into the matrix and CD44 high expressing CSCs were markedly suppressed by erlotinib in organotypic 3D culture. In conclusion, EMT is a critical process for generation of CSCs and the invasive front of ESCC, where EMT occurs, might form a CSC niche in ESCC. EGFR inhibitors could suppress EMT in invasive fronts and be one therapeutic option targeting against generation of CSCs in ESCC. ",

For localized gastric/gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer there are conflicting data that a peri-operative approach with cisplatin-based chemotherapy improves survival, with the benefits seen in esophageal cancer likely less than a 5-10% incremental improvement. Further trends toward improvement in local control and survival, when combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given pre-operatively, are suggested by recent phase III trials. In fit patients, a significant survival benefit with pre-operative chemoradiation is seen in those patients who achieve a pathologic complete response. In esophageal/GEJ cancer, definitive chemoradiation is now considered in medically inoperable patients. In squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, surgery after primary chemoradiation is not clearly associated with an improved overall survival, however, local control may be better. In localized gastric/GEJ cancer, the integration of bevacizumab with pre-operative chemotherapy is being explored in large randomized studies, and with chemoradiotherapy in pilot trials. The addition of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 antibody treatment to pre-operative chemoradiation continues to be explored. Early results show the integration of targeted therapy is feasible. Metabolic imaging can predict early response to pre-operative chemotherapy and biomarkers may further predict response to pre-operative chemo-targeted therapy. A multimodality approach to localized gastro-esophageal cancer has resulted in better outcomes. For T3 or node-positive disease, surgery alone is no longer considered appropriate and neo-adjuvant therapy is recommended. The future of neo-adjuvant strategies in this disease will involve the individualization of therapy with the integration of molecular signatures, targeted therapy, metabolic imaging and predictive biomarkers.",

Amplification of the c-myc gene was observed in 5 cell lines derived from well-differentiated carcinomas and all of them were accompanied by co-amplification of other examined oncogenes. The c-erbB gene was amplified in 3 cell lines. Co-amplification of hst-1 and cyclin D1, both of which are located in chromosome 11q13, was found in 9 cell lines. Without exception their amplification was simultaneous and the magnitudes were similar. Their amplification, but not their overexpression, was significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients from whom the cell lines were established. While hst-1-gene expression was not detected, at least 1 of the genes analyzed was overexpressed in 20 cell lines vs. its expression in normal esophageal mucosal tissues. However, gene amplification was not necessarily accompanied by overexpression of the corresponding genes. Expression of the cyclin D1 gene, which has been assumed to be a target gene for 11q13 amplification, was not detected in one particular cell line with amplification of 11q13. These results suggest that the amplification/overexpression of more than I oncogene is involved in the carcinogenic process of esophageal carcinoma and that c-myc-gene amplification is associated with a well-differentiated subtype. There remains a possibility that key oncogenes other than cyclin D1 are involved in 11q13 amplification.",

We explored mechanisms that lead to activation of beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) independent of adenomatous polyposis coli and beta-catenin mutation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay demonstrated that TCF4 and beta-catenin form a complex and have DNA binding activity. However, there was no constitutive activation of beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. Coculture experiments demonstrated that Wnt-1, but not Wnt-5A and Wnt-7A, activated the TCF reporter gene. Additionally, when cultured with Wnt-1-conditioned media, ESCC cell lines showed an accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm. Although both Wnt and epidermal growth factor inactivate glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, activation of epidermal growth factor receptor did not stabilize beta-catenin.

EGFR activation is associated with the induction of divergent signal transduction pathways and a gamut of cellular processes; however, the cell-type and tissue-type specificity conferred by certain pathways remains to be elucidated. In the context of the esophageal epithelium, a prototype stratified squamous epithelium, EGFR overexpression is relevant in the earliest events of carcinogenesis as modeled in a three-dimensional organotypic culture system. We demonstrate that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, and not the MEK/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, is preferentially activated in EGFR-mediated esophageal epithelial hyperplasia, a premalignant lesion. The hyperplasia was abolished with direct inhibition of PI3K and of AKT but not with inhibition of the MAPK pathway. With the introduction of an inducible AKT vector in both primary and immortalized esophageal epithelial cells, we find that AKT overexpression and activation is permissive for complete epithelial formation in organotypic culture, but imposes a growth constraint in cells grown in monolayer.

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is on the rise and patients with this disease typically have very poor prognosis. Informative biomarkers would benefit the clinical management of this disease. We examined 13 cases with esophageal adenocarcinomas and 5 cases with Barrett's esophagus for amplification of the EGFR and erbB-2 genes. We detected multiple copies of the EGFR gene in 30.8% of the tumors and multiple copies of the erbB-2 gene in 15.4% of the tumors. Of the cases with amplification of the erbB-2 gene, co-amplification of the EGFR gene was found. Multiple copies of the EGFR gene were also found in one case of Barrett's esophagus. Immunohistochemical staining of the tissues revealed increased expression of the erbB-2 protein in Barrett's mucosa and adenocarcinoma, but no associations between staining intensity and degree of EGFR or erbB-2 gene amplification, histology, or tumor stage were found. Differential polymerase chain reaction was examined as a method for pre-operative detection of gene amplification in esophageal tumors and Barrett's mucosa.",

Conversely, inhibition of ErbB pathways with targeted agents, such as monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), blocks cell cycle progression, inhibits the production of pro-angiogenic factors and induces apoptosis in numerous in vitro and xenograft models. Accordingly, the ErbB receptor family with their most prominent members EGFR and HER-2 represents validated targets for anti-cancer therapy, and anti-ErbB MoAbs (cetuximab, panitumumab, and trastuzumab) and TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib) have now been approved for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, as well as pancreatic and breast cancer.

Restoration of RAR-beta(2) inhibited growth and colony formation of esophageal cancer cells, which was correlated with COX-2 suppression. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms for RAR-beta(2)-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression using BPDE as a tool. We found that BPDE-induced COX-2 expression was through inhibition of RAR-beta(2) and consequently, induction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and c-Jun expression. Esophageal cancer cells that do not express RAR-beta(2) did not respond to BPDE for induction of COX-2. BPDE was also unable to induce COX-2 expression after RAR-beta(2) expression was manipulated in these esophageal cancer cells. Furthermore, BPDE induced time-dependent methylation of RAR-beta(2) gene promoter in esophageal cancer cells. Transfection of RAR-beta(2) expression vector into esophageal cancer cells suppressed expression of EGFR, Erk1/2 phosphorylation, c-Jun, and COX-2. In addition, co-treatment of RAR-beta(2)-positive cells with BPDE and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 caused little change in c-Jun and COX-2 expression. This study demonstrated that BPDE-suppressed expression of RAR-beta(2) results in COX-2 induction and restoration of RAR-beta(2) expression reduces COX-2 protein in esophageal cancer cells, thereby further supporting our previous finding that RAR-beta(2) plays an important role in suppressing esophageal carcinogenesis.",

We observed similar effects of EGCG in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma KYSE 150 cells and epidermoid squamous cell carcinoma A431 cells. Pretreatment of KYSE 150 cells with EGCG (20 micromol/L) for 0.5 to 24 hours in HAM's F12 and RPMI 1640 mixed medium at 37 degrees C, before the addition of EGF, resulted in a decreased level of phosphorylated EGFR (by 32-85%). Prolonged treatment with EGCG (8 or 24 hours) also decreased EGFR protein level (both by 80%). EGCG treatment for 24 hours also caused decreased signals of HER-2/neu in esophageal adenocarcinoma OE19 cells. These effects of EGCG were prevented or diminished by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD, 5 units/mL), or SOD plus catalase (30 units/mL), to the cell culture medium. A similar phenomenon on inactivation of EGFR was observed in A431 cells as well. Under culture conditions for KYSE 150 cells, EGCG was unstable, with a half-life of approximately 30 minutes; EGCG dimers and other oxidative products were formed. The presence of SOD in the culture medium stabilized EGCG and increased its half-life to longer than 24 hours and some EGCG epimerized to (+)-gallocatechin-3-gallate. A mechanism of superoxide radical-mediated dimerization of EGCG and H2O2 formation is proposed. The stabilization of EGCG by SOD in the culture medium potentiated the activity of EGCG in inhibiting KYSE 150 cell growth. The results suggest that in cell culture conditions, the auto-oxidation of EGCG leads to EGFR inactivation, but the inhibition of cell growth is due to other mechanisms. It remains to be determined whether the presently observed auto-oxidation of EGCG occurs in vivo. In future studies of EGCG and other polyphenolic compounds in cell culture, SOD may be added to stabilize EGCG and to avoid possible artifacts.",

Several prognostic biomarkers have been proposed, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The aim of this study was to assess whether EGFR expression predicts EA staging and patient survival. Methods. In this historical cohort, consecutive patients with EA managed between 2000 and 2010 were considered eligible for the study. Surgical specimens of patients treated with transhiatal esophagectomy were evaluated to establish EGFR expression and tumor differentiation. Staging was classified according with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. Survival was determined according to either medical register or patient's family contact. Results. Thirty-seven patients who underwent esophagectomy without presurgical chemotherapy or radiotherapy were studied. EGFR expression was found in 16 patients (43%). EGFR expression was more frequent as higher was the TNM (I and II = 0% versus III = 47% versus IV = 100%; P < 0.001). Average survival in months was significantly shorter in the group of patients with EGFR expression (10.5 versus 21.7; P = 0.001). Conclusions. In patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with transhiatal esophagectomy, EGFR expression was related to higher TNM staging and shorter survival.

This multicenter phase 2 study investigated the efficacy of the addition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor panitumumab to a preoperative CRT regimen with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and radiation therapy in patients with resectable esophageal cancer.;Patients with resectable cT1N1M0 or cT2-3N0 to -2M0 tumors received preoperative CRT consisting of panitumumab (6 mg/kg) on days 1, 15, and 29, weekly administrations of carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] = 2), and paclitaxel (50 mg/m(2)) for 5 weeks and concurrent radiation therapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week), followed by surgery. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. We aimed at a pCR rate of more than 40%. Furthermore, we explored the predictive value of biomarkers (EGFR, HER 2, and P53) for pCR.;From January 2010 until December 2011, 90 patients were enrolled. Patients were diagnosed predominantly with adenocarcinoma (AC) (80%), T3 disease (89%), and were node positive (81%). Three patients were not resected due to progressive disease. The primary aim was unmet, with a pCR rate of 22%. Patients with AC and squamous cell carcinoma reached a pCR of 14% and 47%, respectively. R0 resection was achieved in 95% of the patients. Main grade 3 toxicities were rash (12%), fatigue (11%), and nonfebrile neutropenia (11%). None of the biomarkers was predictive for response.;The addition of panitumumab to CRT with carboplatin and paclitaxel was safe and well tolerated but could not improve pCR rate to the preset criterion of 40%.",

As a result of its potential role in the selection of therapy, HER-2/neu testing has reached near-standard-of-practice status in breast cancer. There is considerable interest in HER-2/neu as a prognostic factor and target of therapy in tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In this review of HER-2/neu expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, and colon, a wide range of expression of HER-2/neu from 0 to 83% likely reflects both differences in methods and reagents, as well as study bias associated with patient selection (i.e., early versus advanced disease). For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, little information exists as to the prognostic significance of HER-2/neu expression. In adenocarcinoma associated with Barrett's esophagus there is contradictory data. However, most of the information available indicates that this marker has significant prognostic value. In gastric adenocarcinoma, the wide expression range may truly reflect patient selection because HER-2/neu positivity appears linked to advanced rather than early disease with limited invasion. The majority of studies favor a significant prognostic value of HER-2/neu status for this tumor. Finally, in colorectal cancer HER-2/neu overexpression also appears to be a significant adverse outcome indicator as judged by the current published literature. In conclusion, given that either HER-2/neu protein overexpression or gene amplification is associated with approximately one-fourth of all gastrointestinal tract malignancies, strategies designed to employ the marker in therapy selection appear warranted. During the next several years it will not be surprising to see these tumors treated with antiHER-2/neu modalities such as Herceptin, likely in combination with other agents initially for patients with advanced disease, and possibly for individuals with high-risk lesions in an adjuvant setting.",

In situ hybridization was used to assess miRNA expression and its correlation with prognosis. miRNA-related DNA methylations were identified using bisulfite genomic sequencing, and the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was investigated using RNA interference. miRNA targets were screened by mRNA sequencing, and functional validation was performed in vitro and in vivo.;NGS-based miRNA profiling identified 78 differentially expressed miRNAs in ESCC. Among them, microRNA126-3p (miR-126) was significantly downregulated, and its downregulation correlated with poor ESCC prognosis. Downregulation of miR-126 was due to promoter hypermethylation of its host gene, Egfl7. DNMT1 was aberrantly upregulated in ESCC and responsible for the hypermethylation of Egfl7. Intriguingly, DNMT1 was suppressed by overexpression of miR-126, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback circuit. ADAM9 was identified as a key target of miR-126. Ectopic expression of miR-126 or silencing of ADAM9 reduced ESCC cell proliferation and migration by inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor-AKT signaling.;Our results indicate that miR-126 is a potential prognostic indicator for ESCC and suggest that a novel \"DNMT1-miR-126 epigenetic circuit\" is involved in ESCC progression.

Targeting these driver mutations, such as sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, has dramatically improved the prognosis of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical benefit of molecularly targeted therapy on NSCLC appears to be different between lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SqCCs). We report here that the resistance of lung SqCC harboring EGFR mutations to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) was due to the activation of BMP-BMPR-Smad1/5-p70S6K. The combined treatment of these tumor cells with EGFR-TKI, together with inhibitors specific to BMPR or downstream mTOR, effectively reversed the resistance to EGFR-TKI. Moreover, blocking the whole PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway with the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235 also showed efficacy in treating this subtype of lung SqCC.

Two gastric cancer cells, NUGC-4 and MKN-45, showed similar profiles of phosphorylation but their responses to growth factors differed from each other. Tyrosine phosphorylation in NUGC-4 was strongly activated by treatment with epidermal growth factor and quickly reduced by the acid treatment which is effective in removing growth factors from cellular surface receptors.

Recently, an important role for TGFβ signaling has been described in the crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells regulating squamous tumor cell invasion in mouse models of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Loss of TGFβ signaling, in either compartment, leads to HNSCC however, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Using organotypic reconstruct cultures (OTC) to model the interaction between epithelial and stromal cells that occur in dysplastic lesions, we show that loss of TGFβ signaling promotes an invasive phenotype in both fibroblast and epithelial compartments. Employing immortalized esophageal keratinocytes established to reproduce common mutations of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, we show that treatment of OTC with inhibitors of TGFβ signaling (A83-01 or SB431542) enhances invasion of epithelial cells into a fibroblast-embedded Matrigel/collagen I matrix. Invasion induced by A83-01 is independent of proliferation but relies on protease activity and expression of ADAMTS-1 and can be altered by matrix density. This invasion was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1 and EGFR ligands HB-EGF and TGFα. Altering EGF signaling prevented or induced epithelial cell invasion in this model. Loss of expression of the TGFβ target gene ROBO1 suggested that chemorepulsion may regulate keratinocyte invasion. Taken together, our data show increased invasion through inhibition of TGFβ signaling altered epithelial-fibroblasts interactions, repressing markers of activated fibroblasts, and altering integrin-fibronectin interactions. These results suggest that inhibition of TGFβ signaling modulates an array of pathways that combined promote multiple aspects of tumor invasion. ",

However, the expression and role of the extra-nuclear NCL in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were not well characterized. Here, NCL was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting in 60 ESCC tissues. Further, the associations of NCL, EGFR, CXCR4 and Ki67 were analyzed by in vitro assays. Our results showed that NCL expression in all 40 cases of ESCC tissues with metastasis was extensively located in the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell membrane (extra-nucleus), while NCL expression in all 20 cases of ESCC without metastasis was merely limited into the nucleus (intra-nucleus).The extra-nuclear NCL expression was positively correlated with the expression of EGFR, CXCR4 and Ki67 and serves as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients. In vitro, NCL siRNA (si-NCL) efficaciously affected the expression of EGF or SDF-1-induced p-AKT, p-ERK and Ki67. Also, NCL siRNA inhibited the capacity of migration and invasion of ECA109 cells. In conclusions, our study suggests that NCL is implicated in the initiation and transduction of EGFR and CXCR4 signaling and further up-regulates Ki67 expression to modulate the biological behaviors of ESCC. Clinically, the extra-nuclear NCL expression can be used as an important indicator to determine metastasis and predict the prognosis, which help develop new therapeutic strategies against ESCC. ",

Here we show that by using RNAi the expression of endogenous erbB1 can be specifically and extensively (90%) suppressed in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. As a consequence, EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited and cell proliferation was reduced due to induction of apoptosis. We established an inverse correlation between the level of expressed erbB1 and EGF sensitivity on a cell-by-cell basis using flow cytometry. A431 cells expressing endogenous erbB1 were transfected with erbB1 fused C-terminally to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP).

The KYSE-150R cell line was exposed to radiation, treatment with cetuximab, and combined treatment. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Radiation survival was analyzed using clonogenic assays. RT(2) profiler PCR array was performed to analyze EGF/PDGF signaling pathway genes.;The established esophageal carcinoma cell line KYSE-150R showed higher radioresistance than parental cell line. Cetuximab could reverse the radiation resistance of KYSE-150R cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that combination with radiation and cetuximab resulted in the accumulation of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, with the reduction of cells within the S phase. Cetuximab enhanced the apoptosis induced by radiation. RT(2) profiler array showed that some intracellular signaling genes deriving from EGF/PDGF signaling pathway regulated by cetuximab.;Irradiation combined with EGFR blocked by cetuximab may reverse the resistance to radiation in radioresistant esophageal carcinoma cell. The mechanisms may include cell cycle perturbation and enhancement of radiation-induced apoptosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy in the management of esophageal carcinoma.",

Overexpression of EGF, TGF-alpha and EGF receptor (EGFR) by tumor cells is closely correlated with the tumor invasion and patient prognosis. This is substantiated by the facts that EGF and TGF-alpha act as autocrine growth factors and then induce the expression of mRNAs for multi-growth factors and their receptors (EGF, TGF-alpha, EGFR, ERBB2, PDGF). Moreover, they stimulate the expression of metalloproteinase genes suggesting that EGF and TGF-alpha successively evoke cascade phenomena which are most convenient for tumor progression, invasion and metastasis. On the other hand, multiple oncogene alterations take place in the process of tumor progression. HST-1 and INT-2 genes which is a member of fibroblast growth factor gene family, are amplified in approximately 50% of primary tumors and all the metastatic tumors of esophageal carcinomas. The amplification of ERBB2 gene in metastatic gastric carcinomas is detected more frequently than in primary carcinomas. Overexpression of multi-growth factor-receptor systems might lead to genetical alterations. Scirrhous gastric carcinoma has vast fibrous stroma with rapid and extensive growth and exhibits high malignancy. Its fibrous stroma may account for synchronous overexpression of EGF, TGF-alpha, PDGF, IGF and TGF-beta by tumor cells. Most of well differentiated adenocarcinomas show overexpression of p 185ERBB2 and coexpression of p 185ERBB2, and EGFR evidently correlates with high malignancy. In conclusion, the accumulation and interaction of several growth factors produced by tumor cells are necessary for the progression of human esophageal and gastric carcinomas. They may be attributed to genetic changes including activation of oncogenes, inactivation and deletion of anti-oncogenes and transcriptional regulatory sequences.",

Our data indicate that AKT is crucial for ErbB/FASN interaction, AKT cross-inhibits ERK and feeds loops that boost FASN and EGFR transcription, and EGFR and ErbB2 must be co-silenced for maximal FASN downregulation.

A pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was applied to evaluate the effect of HER2 overexpression for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).;Eighteen studies were identified (2872 patients). HER2 overexpression was significantly associated with poor OS (HR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.11-1.85, P=0.006). This effect was observed both ESCC (HR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.04-2.11, P=0.031) and in EAC (HR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.07-2.46, P=0.023).

Some of these molecules have been implicated in the neoplastic process as well. A related DNA fragment distinct from epidermal growth factor receptor and erbB-2 genes was detected by reduced stringency hybridization of v-erbB to normal genomic human DNA. The expression of erbB-3 was studied by southern and northern blot technique in a subset of nine head and neck tumor cell lines, as well as in three immortalized cultures established from normal human salivary glands. No gene amplification of erb-B-3 was noted in any of the head and neck cell lines.

It is frequently overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas originating from the head/neck and esophagus. Yet, the functional consequences of aberrant cyclin D1 overexpression are not entirely understood apart from increased cell proliferation. To address this question, we have developed a transgenic mouse model in which the EBV ED-L2 promoter targets cyclin D1 to the stratified squamous epithelium in a tissue-specific fashion to the tongue and esophagus, thereby resulting in a dysplastic phenotype. We now demonstrate that the dysplastic phenotype is associated with increased cell proliferation based on proliferating cell nuclear antigen overexpression and abnormalities in cyclin-dependent kinase 4, epidermal growth factor receptor, and p53. In aggregate, these studies suggest that alterations in certain oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes occur early during head/neck and esophageal carcinogenesis.",

Alterations in epidermal growth factor receptors are closely related to malignancy transformation in a number of tumors and recent successful targeted therapies have been directed to these molecules. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the expression of EGFR and HER2 and evaluated EGFR mutation profile as well as the presence of mutations in hotspots of KRAS and BRAF in ESCC patients.;We performed RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry and Fluorescent in situ hybridization to determine EGFR and HER2 expression in ESCC patients, and direct sequencing and PCR-RFLP for mutations and polymorphism analysis.;Our results showed an increased EGFR mRNA expression in tumors compared to surrounding tissue (p <0.05), with 11% of the cases presenting at least a four-fold difference between tumor and paired adjacent mucosa. EGFR protein overexpression was present only in 4% of the cases. The median expression of HER2 mRNA was not different between tumors and adjacent mucosa. Still, 7% of the tumors presented at least a 25-fold higher expression of this gene when compared to its paired counterpart. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 21% of the tumors were positive for HER2 (scores 2+ and 3+), although only 3+ tumors presented amplification of this gene. Mutation analysis for EGFR (exons 18-21), KRAS (codons 12 and 13) and BRAF (V600E) showed no mutations in any of the hotspots of these genes in almost 100 patients analyzed. EGFR presented synonymous polymorphisms at codon 836 (C>T) in 2.1% of the patients, and at codon 787 (G>A) in 79.2% of the cases. This last polymorphism was also evaluated in 304 healthy controls, which presented a similar frequency (73.7%) in comparison with ESCC patients. The absence of mutations of EGFR, KRAS and BRAF as well as the overexpression of EGFR and HER2 in less than 10% of the patients suggest that this signaling pathway is altered in only a small proportion of patients with ESCC.;HER receptors target therapies may have the potential to be effective in only a minor fraction of patients with ESCC.",

Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on HER2 and dual-color in situ hybridization (ISH) were performed. HER2 status was determined by following a clinical algorithm, first determining HER2 overexpression on immunohistochemistry and, when equivocal (2+), determining HER2 amplification on ISH.

Interobserver agreement on IHC scoring for all three observers was 83% in biopsies and 85% in resection specimens. HER2 positivity was detected in 22% of esophageal adenocarcinomas.

Although tumour-specific overexpression affected each ErbB receptor (EGFR 47%, ErbB2 29%, ErbB3 21%, ErbB4 26%), EGFR abnormalities were most prevalent. The latter, and overexpression of more than two ErbB receptors in the same tumour, which always included EGFR, correlated with metastatic disease. ErbB products were specifically detected on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. In contrast, ErbB4 was uniquely localized to the nucleus in 7 carcinomas and a tumour-derived cell line, indicating a role for regulated intramembrane proteolysis resulting in nuclear ErbB4 translocation in HNSCC. Expression of prototype ligand EGF or low-affinity stromal activator tenascin correlated significantly with EGFR overexpression, implying chronic EGFR activation. Simultaneous overexpression of additional ErbB receptors in most of these cases suggested recurrent involvement of receptor heterodimers. In spite of frequent ErbB receptor alterations, autologous ErbB serum antibodies were rare, with only 1 of 38 tumour patients exhibiting an ErbB2-specific immune response. Based on upregulation of several known immunosuppressive molecules, scarcity of ErbB-specific antibodies is consistent with attenuation of natural tumour-specific immune responses in HNSCC.",

It is thought that this is the reason for the poor efficacy of pemetrexed in squamous cell carcinoma. However, there is limited data on thymidylate synthase expression in adenosquamous carcinoma, a distinct subtype of lung cancer containing both squamous and glandular differentiation. Furthermore, molecular alterations like epidermal growth factor receptor and Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog mutations, which are seen in adenocarcinomas, are not well understood in mixed histology tumors such as adenosquamous carcinoma. In our study, we sought to better characterize adenosquamous tumors of the lung. Using immunohistochemistry to evaluate thymidylate synthase protein levels, we found that the expression of thymidylate synthase in these mixed tumors roughly parallel that of squamous cell carcinoma, instead of falling in between squamous cell and adenocarcinoma. Of note, in adenosquamous samples, the expression of thymidylate synthase was more closely correlated within the two components than would be expected by random chance alone. Also, we had a relatively high rate of epidermal growth factor receptor (11%) and Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (33%) mutations in these specimens, with the mutations showing convergence in both the glandular and squamous components upon microdissection. Our results indicate that adenosquamous carcinomas are not simple mixtures of their two histological components; they rather behave as their own entity, and it is important to further understand their behavior. Given the similarity of thymidylate synthase expression between squamous cell and adenosquamous carcinoma, and that thymidylate synthase is the main target of pemetrexed, we extrapolate that pemetrexed may also have inferior clinical activity in adenosquamous carcinoma.",

Toxicity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Erlotinib with concurrent 5-FU, cisplatin and thoracic radiation was well-tolerated at 50, 100 and 150 mg/day. The major toxicities were diarrhea (grade 1=18%, grade 2=18%), skin rash (grade 4=54.5%), nausea (grade 1=18%, grade 2=54%, grade 3=9%) and dehydration (grade 3=27%).

Epidermal growth factor modulated the differentiation of A431 and 686 with respect to involucrin immunohistochemistry and cornified enveloped competency. Monoclonal antibody 528 directed against epidermal growth factor receptor inhibited cellular proliferation as measured by cell number, thymidine incorporation, and multicellular tumor spheroid volume. A mild promotion of differentiation was observed in the epidermal growth factor-responsive cells. In conclusion, monoclonal antibody 528 directed against epidermal growth factor receptor inhibits growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells bearing high levels of epidermal growth factor receptors and promotes differentiation in some tumors. The use of a multicellular tumor spheroid model to evaluate growth factor responsiveness and inhibition of proliferation may more accurately reflect in vivo tumor growth than monolayer cells. Antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor may prove effective in modulating disease progression in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",

With the advent of new therapeutic options targeting EGFR signalling in colon carcinoma, it was decided to determine ADAM17 status in relation to clinico-pathological parameters and EGFR status. To this end, a series of 39 colon carcinomas were analysed. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to localize ADAM17, EGFR, and the activated forms of EGFR. The activated form of ADAM17 was assessed in primary cancers and colon cell lines by immunoblotting. ADAM17 and EGFR mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was used to quantify the HER1 gene. ADAM17 was strongly expressed in all tumours, by both neoplastic and endothelial cells. It was expressed both as a pro- and as an active form in tumours and colonic cancer cell lines. ADAM17 mRNA was up-regulated in 90% of colon carcinomas relative to the paired normal mucosa, whatever the tumour grade or stage. When present, activated EGFR was co-expressed with ADAM17 by colon carcinomas, although at a variable level among tumour cells, and by endothelial cells. EGFR mRNA was overexpressed in 77% of colon carcinomas compared with the paired normal mucosa. One case showed high-level amplification of HER1. In conclusion, this study is the first demonstration that ADAM17 is overexpressed in human primary colon carcinoma, whatever the tumour stage and differentiation and whatever the level of EGFR expression. Its co-expression with EGFR, in both neoplastic and endothelial cells, suggests a role for ADAM17 in tumour growth and angiogenesis.",

Of the 697 NSCLC patients, 235 (33.7%) patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) sensitive EGFR mutations in 41 (14.5%) of the 282 squamous carcinomas, 155 (52.9%) of the 293 adenocarcinomas, 34 (39.5%) of the 86 adenosquamous carcinomas, one (9.1%) of the 11 large-cell carcinomas, 2 (11.1%) of the 18 sarcomatoid carcinomas, and 2 (28.6%) of the 7 mucoepidermoid carcinomas. TKIs sensitive EGFR mutations were more frequently found in female patients (p < 0.001), non-smokers (p = 0.047) and adenocarcinomas (p < 0.001). The rates of exon 19 deletion mutation (19-del), exon 21 L858R point mutation (L858R), exon 21 L861Q point mutation (L861Q), exon 18 G719X point mutations (G719X, including G719C, G719S, G719A) were 43.4%, 48.1%, 1.7% and 6.8%, respectively. Exon 20 T790M point mutation (T790M) was detected in 3 squamous carcinomas and 3 adenocarcinomas and exon 20 insertion mutation (20-ins) was detected in 2 patients with adenocarcinoma. Our results show the rates of EGFR mutations are higher in all types of NSCLC in Chinese patients. 19-del and L858R are two of the more frequent mutations.

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). These trans-membrane proteins are activated following binding with peptide growth factors of the EGF-family of proteins. Evidence suggests that the EGFR is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different carcinoma types. The EGFR and EGF-like peptides are often over-expressed in human carcinomas, and in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that these proteins are able to induce cell transformation. Amplification of the EGFR gene and mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been recently demonstrated to occur in carcinoma patients. Interestingly, both these genetic alterations of the EGFR are correlated with high probability to respond to anti-EGFR agents. However, ErbB proteins and their ligands form a complex system in which the interactions occurring between receptors and ligands affect the type and the duration of the intracellular signals that derive from receptor activation. In fact, proteins of the ErbB family form either homo- or hetero-dimers following ligand binding, each dimer showing different affinity for ligands and different signaling properties. In this regard, evidence suggests that cooperation of multiple ErbB receptors and cognate ligands is necessary to induce cell transformation. In particular, the growth and the survival of carcinoma cells appear to be sustained by a network of receptors/ligands of the ErbB family. This phenomenon is also important for therapeutic approaches, since the response to anti-EGFR agents might depend on the total level of expression of ErbB receptors and ligands in tumor cells.",

Sadly, advances in treatment have not followed the same trend, and the prognosis for patients with esophageal ACA remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of only 15%. Like most cancers, early detection is the key to improving prognosis, but this outcome has proven difficult in the esophagus for several reasons: 1) patients present with advanced disease because \"alarm symptoms,\" such as dysphagia, occur at a late stage, and 2) high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early ACA are not visible on routine surveillance endoscopy. Currently, the recommended surveillance strategy involves collection of random biopsies, an imperfect technique that is limited by sampling error and is infrequently used because of the considerable time and cost it requires. Even in patients with biopsy-proven dysplasia, adequate guidance for clinical management decisions is still lacking. Dysplasia alone is not an entirely reliable biomarker for the risk of progression to ACA because the natural history of this condition is extremely variable. Clearly, there is a need for additional biomarkers that can better characterize this disease and thus improve our ability to treat patients on an individual basis. As we better understand the molecular changes that lead to the development of this cancer, new molecular biomarkers are needed to allow for more personalized diagnoses, surveillance, and treatment. Targeted agents against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are currently being evaluated for their role in combination chemotherapy for metastatic esophageal ACA. As these studies progress, a reliable approach for determining receptor status in individual patients is essential. Molecular imaging uses fluorescent probes that target specific cell-surface receptors, and has the potential to evaluate an individual patient's gene expression profile. By topically applying fluorescent probes to dysplastic epithelium during endoscopy, a variety of receptors can be visualized, and the response to treatment can be monitored in real time. This technique can mitigate the limitations of current surveillance protocols, allow for improved cancer detection, and be used for personalized treatment in the future.",

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) are associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression and may upregulate AQPs expression. In this study, we investigated acquaporin-8 expression and signaling via epidermal growth factor receptor-extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 in human esophageal cancer Eca-109 cells by western blot, immunofluorescence and wound healing (scratch) assays. Our results showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced both Eca-109 migration and AQP8 expression. Wound healing results showed that cell migration was increased by 1.23-1.10-fold at 24 h and 48 h after EGF treatment. AQP8 expression was significantly increased (1.19-fold) at 48 h after EGF treatment in Eca-109. The EGFR kinase inhibitor, PD153035, blocked EGF-induced AQP8 expression and cell migration. AQP8 expression was decreased from 3.65-fold (EGF-treated) to 0.55-fold (PD153035-treated) in Eca-109. Furthermore, the MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/Erk1/2]/Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126 also inhibited EGF-induced AQP8 expression and cell migration. AQP8 expression was decreased from 3.92-fold (EGF-treated) to 1.38-fold (U0126-treated) in Eca-109.

Early metastatic disease and late diagnosis are common reasons responsible for this tumor's poor clinical outcome. The prognosis of esophageal cancer is very poor because patients usually do not have symptoms in early disease stages. Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus frequently complicates patients with multiple co-morbidities and these patients often require interdisciplinary diagnosis and treatment procedures. At present time, neoadjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy followed by surgery are regarded as the international standard of care. Meta-analyses have confirmed that this approach provides the patient with better local tumor control and an increased overall survival rate. It is recommended that patients with positive tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy and who are poor surgical candidates should consider definitive radiochemotherapy without surgery as a treatment option. In future, EGFR antibodies may also be administered to patients during therapy to improve the current treatment effectiveness. Positron-emission tomography proves to be an early response-imaging tool used to evaluate the effect of the neoadjuvant therapy and could be used as a predictive factor for the survival rate in ESCC. The percentage proportions of residual tumor cells in the histopathological analyses represent a gold standard for evaluating the response rate to radiochemotherapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of cyclin D1 and disruption of cell cycle control in G(1) occur frequently in human esophageal cancer. Transgenic (TG) mice with cyclin D1 overexpression targeted to the oral-esophageal tissue by the EBV ED-L2 promoter showed increased severity in esophageal dysplasia without cancer development, after multiple doses of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA). Dietary zinc deficiency (ZD) in mice enhances cellular proliferation in esophagus/forestomach and susceptibility to NMBA-induced carcinogenesis. We investigated whether cyclin D1 overexpression in TG mice, together with ZD, might lead to unchecked cell proliferation and accelerated NMBA-induced tumorigenesis. Five-week-old TG and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a ZD- or -sufficient (ZS) diet, forming four groups: ZD:TG; ZS:TG; ZD:WT; and ZS:WT. After 4 weeks, animals were given a single intragastric NMBA dose and were sacrificed 25 and 77 days later. Without NMBA, cell proliferation was greatest in ZD:TG esophagus/forestomach, followed by ZD:WT, and then ZS:TG>/=ZS:WT. The high rate of cell proliferation was accompanied by overexpression of cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis biomarkers, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, p53, cytokeratin 14, epidermal growth factor receptor, and by a reduced rate of apoptosis. ZD substantially increased forestomach tumor incidence in TG mice: 85% of ZD:TG versus 14% of ZS:TG mice had forestomach tumors (P < 0.001), with progression to malignancy occurring only in ZD:TG tumors. Additionally, 14% of ZD:TG mice developed esophageal tumors and esophageal intestinal metaplasia at 77 days. Thus, cyclin D1 overexpression, in cooperation with ZD, decontrols cell proliferation, ensuring cell expansion, a prerequisite for cancer development.",

PCR with a specific condition was performed to identify any deletion in exon 19, while mutant-allele-specific amplification was performed to identify a mutation in codon 858 of exon 21. EGFR mutations were found in 136 cases (42.2%) with adenocarcinoma, in one case with large cell carcinoma, and in one case with pleomorphic carcinoma. An in-frame deletion in exon 19 was found in 62 cases while an L858R mutation was found in 77 cases. In the 322 cases with adenocarcinoma, these mutations were more frequently found in women than in men (P=0.0004), in well differentiated tumours than in poorly differentiated tumours (P=0.0014), and in patients who were never smokers than in patients who were current/former smokers (P<0.0001).

We investigate the role of epidermal growth factor receptor as a biomarker for head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we assessed the epidermal growth factor receptor protein expression and gene copy in 3 groups of head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: primary lesions not associated with metastasis (P), primary lesions associated with subsequent metastasis (PM), and metastatic nodal disease (M). Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was detected in 36% and 79% of P and PM cases, respectively. Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was significantly associated with PM (P = .03) and was found to be an independent prognostic factor for metastasis on multivariate analysis (P = .05). However, epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was only maintained in 47% of cases in the M group. None of the 27 cases that overexpressed the epidermal growth factor receptor protein showed gene amplification: the results were uninterpretable in 2, and polysomy and balanced disomy were detected in 5 and 20 cases, respectively.

Genotyping of BCL2 (ala43thr), FAS (A-670G), CCND1 (G870A), EGF (+61A/G) and EGFR (G497A) polymorphisms were determined using the polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology.

This prospective, single-armed, open label phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of paclitaxel (T)/cisplatin (P) with nimotuzumab (N) as first-line treatment in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients with pathologic confirmed unresectable locally advanced or metastatic ESCC were treated with the TPN regimen: nimotuzumab 200 mg weekly, paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) on day 1 and cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2; repeat cycle every 3 weeks for six cycles. Radiotherapy was allowed to be admitted after four cycles of TPN treatment. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoint was the overall survival (OS), duration of disease control (DDC) and toxicities. From March 2011 to April 2013, a total of 59 patients were enrolled and 56 were eligible for the final analysis. Overall RR was 51.8% and disease control rate (DCR) (CR + PR + SD) was 92.9%. Local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery) followed by chemotherapy improved the duration of disease control for patients with metastatic disease and local-regional advanced disease to 8.2 months and more than 23 months, respectively. The OS for patients with metastatic disease was 14.0 months (95% CI: 6.8-21.2 months). The most common G3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (46.4%), nausea (48.3%), alopecia (78.6%), anorexia (42.8%), vomiting (55.4%), arthralgia (62.5%) and anorexia (5%). Adding nimotuzumab to the standard TP regiment was safe, and well tolerated. The TPN regimen is an effective combination as the first-line chemotherapy for the patients with advanced ESCC, and appears more active than current standard regimens. ",

Its main clinical application lies in breast carcinomas, where it is a molecular marker to identify breast cancer patients who will respond to hormone therapy. This study was performed to evaluate the significance of the pS2 cytosolic levels in non small cell lung carcinomas classified according to different clinical and biological parameters. Likewise, the results obtained were correlated with those observed in normal tissues.;The study group included 154 non small cell lung carcinomas (59 adenocarcinomas and 95 squamous carcinomas) and 54 normal lung samples. Cathepsin D, pS2, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and CA125 cytosolic concentrations were determined, as well as those of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), erbB2 protein, CD44s, CD44v5 and CD44v6 on cell surface membranes. Likewise, clinical stage, histological grade, ploidy and cellular S-phase fraction were also considered as variables of the study.;We observed cytosolic pS2 values greater than 1 ng/mg protein (positive cutoff) in 18/59 adenocarcinomas and in 10/95 squamous carcinomas (p:0.00177). In adenocarcinomas, pS2 positivity was not correlated with any clinical and biological parameters, but positive cases had lower EGFR (p:0.03770) concentrations and higher CA125 (p:0.01902) levels. In squamous carcinomas, pS2 positivity was associated with lower EGFR (p:0.02270) levels and higher erbB2 protein (p:0,00563) concentrations.;Our results led us to suggest the following: 1) cytosolic pS2 concentrations are higher in tumoral than in normal samples; 2) adenoarcinomas had higher levels than squamous lung carcinomas; 3) in adenocarcinomas, positivity for pS2 is associated with lower EGFR levels and higher CA125 concentrations suggesting a worse outcome, and 4) in squamous lung tumors, positivity for pS2 was associated with lower EGFR and higher erbB2 oncoprotein concentrations, it not being possible to establish its clinical significance, although it may be correlated with a poor prognosis.",

Its management has evolved gradually from surgery as the mainstay of therapy to irradiation as the principal treatment. When radiation therapy is combined with chemotherapy, additional benefit is obtained. The value of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is, however, counterbalanced by increased and often prohibitive toxicity, particularly among patients with coexisting medical conditions and decreased performance status. A member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases known as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is abnormally activated in epithelial cancers, including head and neck cancers. Overexpression of EGFR is a feature associated with poor clinical outcome. It is observed that radiation increases the expression of EGFR in cancer cells and the blockade of EGFR signaling sensitizes cells to the effects of radiation. The cytotoxic effects of radiation therapy in squamous cell carcinoma could be enhanced by cetuximab (erbitux), a monoclonal antibody against the ligand-binding domain of EGFR. The major studies that focus on the efficacy of adding cetuximab to radiotherapy in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer and its impact in quality of life are reviewed in this study.",

This suggests that additional biomarkers are needed to better prognosticate clinical course and guide therapeutic approaches. Previous studies showed that increased levels of aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase and a highly related molecule, humbug, correlate with clinical course and survival with hepatic, biliary, pancreatic, and colon carcinomas. We now characterize the prognostic use of aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase/humbug immunoreactivity in different subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Tissue microarrays including 375 paraffin-embedded non-small cell lung cancers (195 adenocarcinomas; 18 bronchioloalveolar carcinomas; 113 squamous cell carcinomas; and 49 large cell carcinomas) were immunostained with FB50 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes human aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase/humbug. Immunoreactivity (intensity and distribution) in neoplastic cells were scored under code, and data were subjected to univariate and Cox multivariate analyses, adjusting for age, stage, and treatment. High levels of FB50 immunoreactivity were more often detected in adenocarcinomas (28% for adenocarcinoma, 17% for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma), compared with squamous cell carcinomas (10%) and large cell carcinomas (10%). Univariate analysis demonstrated inverse relationships between intensity of FB50 immunoreactivity and survival with squamous cell carcinoma (P = .004), and a strong trend with respect to large cell carcinoma (P = .057). Cox multivariate test showed that FB50 immunoreactivity (P = .025), clinical stage (P = .029), and tumor size (P = .0001) were all independent predictors of survival with squamous cell carcinoma. High levels of FB50 immunohistochemical staining correlate with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma subtype. Therefore, FB50 immunoreactivity may be useful in defining patient subsets that are likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy.",

This manuscript comprehensively reviews the preclinical data on afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) including EGFR, HER2 and ErbB4. Afatinib covalently binds to cysteine 797 of the EGFR and the corresponding cysteines 805 and 803 in HER2 and ErbB4, respectively. Such covalent binding irreversibly inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors, resulting in reduced auto- and transphosphorylation within the ErbB dimers and inhibition of important steps in the signal transduction of all ErbB receptor family members. Afatinib inhibits cellular growth and induces apoptosis in a wide range of cells representative for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer and several other cancer types exhibiting abnormalities of the ErbB network. This translates into tumour shrinkage in a variety of in vivo rodent models of such cancers. Afatinib retains inhibitory effects on signal transduction and in vitro and in vivo cancer cell growth in tumours resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors, such as those exhibiting the T790M mutations. Several combination treatments have been explored to prevent and/or overcome development of resistance to afatinib, the most promising being those with EGFR- or HER2-targeted antibodies, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors or inhibitors of downstream signalling molecules.

Three hundred fifty small cell lung cancers, adenocarcinomas (AC), squamous cell carcinomas (SqCC), and large cell carcinomas were analyzed using a combination of techniques for the analysis of protein expression, gene copy numbers, and mutations. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with antibodies for the EGFR mutations L858R and del E746-A750 revealed intratumoral heterogeneity and several discrepant cases when compared to mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis. The frequencies of these two mutations, when considering IHC staining with mutation-specific antibodies in a cohort of 298 cases and subsequent confirmation by PCR, were 10 % in AC and <2 % in SqCC. Furthermore, screening by sequencing of EGFR in a cohort of 52 lung AC and squamous carcinomas demonstrated a more diverse mutation spectrum, not covered by the mutation-specific antibodies. High expression of total EGFR protein was correlated to high gene copy numbers but did not reflect the mutational status of the tumors. We believe that the mutation spectra in a Southern Swedish population is too diverse to be covered by the mutation-specific antibodies, and we also raise some other issues regarding the use of the mutation-specific antibodies, for example concerning heterogeneous expression of the mutated protein, optimal antibody dilution, and discrepancies between staining results and PCR.",

In addition, beta-adrenoceptor is involved in the control of cancer cell proliferation. This study sought to elucidate whether a functional connection exists between these two disparate receptor systems. EGF was used to stimulate HKESC-1 cells, an esophageal squamous cancer cell line, in which beta-adrenoceptor activity was monitored by measuring intracellular cAMP levels in the absence or presence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Results showed that EGF significantly increased cAMP levels and cell proliferation, both of which were attenuated by atenolol [(+)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]propoxy]benzeneacetamide] or ICI 118,551 [(+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol], which are antagonists for the beta-adrenoceptor. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that the cellular release of epinephrine and the expression of its synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase were induced by EGF. The expression of beta(1)-adrenoceptor and the downstream signal transducer protein kinase A were also up-regulated. In this connection, AG1478 [4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abrogated all these EGF-elicited alteration. Collectively, this study demonstrates that beta-adrenergic signaling could be up-regulated at multiple levels upon EGFR activation to mediate the mitogenic signals in esophageal cancer cells. This novel finding not only unveils the sinister liaison between EGFR and beta-adrenoceptors but also sheds new light on the purported therapeutic use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of esophageal cancer.",

Among these, gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors for patients with EGFR gene mutations, while crizotinib and ceritinib are two new tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against the echinoderm microtubule-like protein 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation. The possibility of these new molecules being used to treat patients without adenocarcinoma histology is notably small. For example, EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion gene rearrangement are rare in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (generally <1%). Additionally, the benefit of targeted treatment approaches in patients with small-cell lung cancer histology is limited. All of these findings highlight the distinctive nature of adenocarcinoma of the lung among all lung cancer subtypes. Unfortunately, to date, less than 15% of patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung are ideal candidates for these targeted therapies. ",

While targeted therapeutic successes have been demonstrated in the therapeutic targeting of EGFR and ALK, the majority of NSCLC tumors do not harbor these genomic events. This review looks at the current treatment paradigms for lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, examining genomic aberrations that dictate therapy selection, as well as novel therapeutic strategies for tumors harboring mutations in KRAS, TP53, and LKB1 which, to date, have been considered \"undruggable\".

The current gold standard method of assessing cancer risk is histological assessment, with the appearance of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) as the key event monitored. Sampling error during endoscopy limits the usefulness of this approach, and there has been much recent interest in supplementing histological assessment with molecular markers, which may aid in patient stratification.;No molecular marker has been yet validated to accurately correlate with esophageal histological progression. Here, we assessed the suitability of several membranous proteins as biomarkers by correlating their abundance with histological progression. In all, 107 patient samples, from 100 patients, were arranged on a tissue microarray (TMA) and represented the various stages of histological progression in BE. This TMA was probed with antibodies for eight receptor proteins (mostly membranous).;Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) staining was found to be the most promising biomarker identified with clear increases in staining accompanying histological progression. Further, immunohistochemistry was performed using the full-tissue sections from BE, HGD, and adenocarcinoma tissues, which confirmed the stepwise increase in EGFR abundance. Using a robust H-score analysis, EGFR abundance was shown to increase 13-fold in the adenocarcinoma tissues compared to the BE tissues. EGFR was \"overexpressed\" in 35% of HGD specimens and 80% of adenocarcinoma specimens when using the H-score of the BE patients (plus 3 s.d.) as the threshold to define overexpression. EGFR staining was also noted to be higher in BE tissues adjacent to HGD/adenocarcinoma. Western blotting, although showing more EGFR protein in the adenocarcinomas compared to the BE tissue, was highly variable. EGFR overexpression was accompanied by aneuploidy (gain) of chromosome 7, plus amplification of the EGFR locus. Finally, the bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) (at neutral and acidic pH) and acid alone was capable of upregulating EGFR mRNA in vitro, and in the case of neutral pH DCA, this was NF-κB dependent.;EGFR is overexpressed during the histological progression in BE tissues and hence may be useful as a biomarker of histological progression. Furthermore, as EGFR is a membranous protein expressed on the luminal surface of the esophageal mucosa, it may also be a useful target for biopsy guidance during endoscopy.",

Southern blot analysis revealed that the structural region of the EGFR gene is methylated to various degrees regardless of the expression of EGF receptor on the surface. An 8-kilobase EcoRI fragment which contains the EGFR gene promoter region is readily digested with various methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes in all types of cells, indicating that the EGFR gene 5' region is barely methylated.

One approach has been the generation of small molecules that compete with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for binding to the receptor's kinase pocket, thus blocking receptor activation and the transduction of postreceptor signals. The second approach utilizes humanized monoclonal antibodies generated against the receptor's ligand-binding extracellular domain. These antibodies block binding of receptor-activating ligands and, in some cases, can induce receptor endocytosis and downregulation.

To address the utility of CISH, we studied paraffin-embedded nonsmall cell lung carcinoma specimens from 77 Taiwanese nonsmoking women treated by surgery alone. We recorded the number of signals per tumor cell nucleus, correlated EGFR copy number by CISH with FISH results, and used receiver operating characteristics to identify cut-off points for the CISH results.

Less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in HNSCC patients.;We analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the EGFR/ErbB receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established HNSCC lines in vitro. IC50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. ErbB signaling was assessed by Western and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pEGFR, pErbB2, pErbB3, pAkt, and pErk. EGFR sequences encoding kinase domain and EGFR gene copy numbers were determined by cDNA sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. Finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux).;Expression levels of pErbB2 (P = 0.02) and total ErbB3 protein (P = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. Combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (Omnitarg), an antibody targeting ErbB2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines. The same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. In contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between EGFR gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (P = 0.0498) and cetuximab (P = 0.053). No activating EGFR mutations were identified.;EGFR amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in HNSCC.

It has been reported that somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR or ERBB2 genes occur in a subset of patients with lung cancer. We searched for mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) to determine the prevalence of these mutations in Korean lung cancer patients. In addition, we examined the relationship between the mutations and clinicopathologic features of lung cancers. Mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequencing in 115 surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers. EGFR mutations were present in 20 patients (17.4%). The EGFR mutations were found only in adenocarcinomas (20 of 55 adenocarcinomas, 36.4%). The ERBB2 mutation was found in 1 adenocarcinoma of the 115 NSCLCs (0.9% overall; 1.8% of the 55 adenocarcinomas). KRAS mutations were found in 6 (5.2%) of the 115 NSCLCs (2 of 60 squamous cell carcinomas, or 3.3%, and 4 of 55 adenocarcinomas, or 7.3%). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were more frequent in women (P = 0.02) and in never-smokers (P = 0.004). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were not associated with pathologic stage in never-smokers, but were more frequent in pathologic stage II-IV than in stage I in ever-smokers (P = 0.01). Of the 55 adenocarcinomas, 25 (45.5%) had mutations of one or another of the three genes; EGFR mutations were never found in adenocarcinomas together with ERBB2 or KRAS mutations. These findings suggest that the EGFR mutation is frequent in Korean lung cancer patients, and that the ERBB2 mutation is rare. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of EGFR mutations in the carcinogenesis of adenocarcinoma among smokers.",

Origin of the cell line was confirmed by microsatellite based genotyping. A panel of cancer-related genes was screened for mutations by targeted deep sequencing, Sanger sequencing and high resolution melting.CDKN2A promoter methylation was assessed by methylation specific high resolution melting. HER2 amplification was assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess expression of markers in xenografts grown in SCID mice.;A novel EAC cell line, OANC1, was derived from a Barrett's-associated EAC. Microsatellite-based genotyping of OANC1 and patient DNA confirmed the origin of the cell line. Sequencing of OANC1 DNA identified homozygous TP53 missense (c.856G[A, p.E286K)and SMAD4 nonsense (c.1333C[T, p.R445X) mutations.OANC1 are tumorigenic when injected sub-cutaneously into SCID mice and xenografts were positive for columnar, glandular and intestinal epithelial markers commonly expressed in EAC. Xenografts exhibited strong p53 expression, consistent with a TP53 mutation. Some proteins, including p16, EGFR and b-catenin, had heterogeneous expression patterns across xenograft cross-sections, indicative of tumor heterogeneity.;OANC1 represents a valuable addition to the limited range of pre-clinical models for EAC.

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of gefitinib against the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines NCI-H82, NCI-H209, NCI-H510, NCI-H526 and NCI-H660. SCLC has been reported to express a low to undetectable level of EGFR. We compared the effects of gefitinib between cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression. First, we evaluated expression levels of EGFR and HER2/neu by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation respectively; EGFR protein was detected in two of the five SCLC cell lines, whereas HER2/neu was not detected in any. Next, we analyzed expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and compared these results with EGFR (HER-1/ErbB1) and HER2/neu (ErbB2) expression levels, as EGFR conducts signals through Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway; gefitinib inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by EGF addition in cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression. These data suggest that gefitinib is potentially effective against cancers with low EGFR expression such as SCLC.",

It is widely believed that AngII promotes these diseases by inducing vascular remodelling that involves hypertrophy, hyperplasia and migration of VSMCs (vascular smooth muscle cells). We have shown that transactivation of an ErbB family receptor, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor; ErbB1), is essential for VSMC hypertrophy and migration induced by AngII. However, the precise signal transduction mechanism by which AngII transactivates EGFR/ErbB1 and whether other ErbBs are also required for AngII function remains unclear. Recent studies suggest an involvement of a metalloprotease-dependent ErbB family ligand production in the transactivation. Here, we will discuss the roles and mechanisms of AngII/AT(1) receptor in promoting ErbB receptors transactivation in VSMCs. Further elucidation of this ErbB activation machinery not only will give us a better understanding of the critical molecular mechanism underlying vascular remodelling stimulated by AngII, but will also contribute to development of novel treatment strategies for cardiovascular diseases.",

The aim of this study was to investigate expression of Yes-associated protein in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Associations of Yes-associated protein expression with clinicopathologic parameters, expression of cell cycle-specific markers, and epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification were also analyzed. In a univariate analysis of the 66 adenocarcinomas, high nuclear expression of Yes-associated protein was significantly correlated with expression of cyclin A and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Multivariate analysis, including age and sex, showed that cyclin A expression was independently correlated with nuclear expression of Yes-associated protein in adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, high nuclear expression of Yes-associated protein was also a significant predictor of epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification for adenocarcinoma. For the 102 squamous cell carcinomas, univariate analysis revealed that high cytoplasmic expression of Yes-associated protein was correlated with the low pathologic TNM staging (stage I) and histologic grading. Multivariate analysis, including age and sex, showed that cytoplasmic expression of Yes-associated protein was an independent predictor of low pathologic TNM staging. These results indicate that nuclear overexpression of Yes-associated protein contributes to pulmonary adenocarcinoma growth and that high cytoplasmic expression of Yes-associated protein is an independent predictor of low pathologic TNM staging and histologic grading. The differential effects of Yes-associated protein expression patterns in adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas suggest that Yes-associated protein may play important roles in different pathways in distinct tumor subtypes. These observations may, therefore, lead to new perspectives on therapeutic targeting of these tumor types.",

Interestingly, its detection rate appears to differ histologically and geographically. The present study examined 30 adenocarcinomas and 27 squamous cell carcinomas of the lung in a southern area of Japan, and detected high-risk HPV genome in 9 (30%) adenocarcinomas and 2 (7%) squamous cell carcinomas, using PCR with SPF10 primers and INNO-LiPA HPV genotyping assay. The difference of HPV detection rates in adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas was statistically significant (P=0.044, Fisher's exact test). HPV-16 was the most prevalent HPV genotype, and was detected in 27% (8/30) of adenocarcinomas and in 7% (2/27) of squamous cell carcinomas. High-risk-HPV positive carcinomas had decreased proportions of pRb (P=0.107) and significantly increased proportions of p16INK4a expressing cells (P=0.031) when compared to HPV-negative lung carcinomas. All HPV-16-positive cases were considered to have an integrated form of HPV-16 but its viral load was low (geometric mean = 0.02 copy per cell). In 20 additional adenocarcinomas treated with gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor specific for epidermal growth factor receptor, the presence of HPV was examined. Note that East Asian ethnicity is a predictive factor of gefitinib response. High-risk HPV genome was found in 75% (6/8) of adenocarcinomas with complete or partial response to gefitinib but was not found in the remaining 12, which did not respond to gefitinib. In conclusion, the present study suggests that high-risk HPV may be more strongly related to adenocarcinomas, particularly gefitinib-responsive adenocarcinomas, when compared to squamous cell carcinomas.

Combined-modality treatment included: paclitaxel, 200 mg/m2, 1-hour i.v. infusion, days 1 and 22; carboplatin, an area under the concentration time curve 6.0 i.v., days 1 and 22; 5-fluorouracil, 225 mg/m2/day, continuous i.v. infusion, days 1-42; and radiation therapy, 45 Gy, 1.8-Gy single daily fractions 5 days weekly, beginning day 1. All patients underwent surgical resection 4-8 weeks after completion of the preoperative therapy.;One hundred twenty-three patients (95%) completed preoperative therapy, 105 patients (81%) underwent attempted resection, and 96 patients (74%) had definitive resection. A pathological complete response was achieved in 47 of 123 evaluable patients (38%); an additional 30 patients (24%) had only microscopic residual tumor. With a median follow-up of 45 months, the median survival is 22 months (95% CI = 15-32 months), with actuarial 1-, 2-, and 3-year survivals of 71%, 47%, and 41%, respectively. The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities of the neoadjuvant program were leukopenia (73%) and esophagitis (43%). Although 73 patients (57%) required brief hospitalizations during preoperative therapy, there were no treatment-related deaths, and 94% of patients remained candidates for resection after the completion of treatment. Six patients (6%) died after surgery.;This novel combined-modality regimen is highly active in the treatment of locoregional esophageal cancer, producing an actuarial 3-year survival of 41%. Although this preoperative regimen produced moderate acute toxicity, there were no treatment-related deaths and the large majority of patients were able to undergo subsequent esophageal resection. These results, obtained in a community-based setting and involving multiple surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists, compare favorably with those of previous single-center and multicenter results.

It is usually associated with a poor prognosis because it is often at an advanced stage when diagnosed and there is a high frequency of lymph node metastases. It is important to know what prognostic factors can facilitate diagnosis, optimize therapeutic decisions, and improve the survival of these patients. A member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, c-erbB-2, has received much attention because of its therapeutic implications; however, few studies involving fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of HER-2/neu gene amplification and protein expression in ESCC have been conducted. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of HER-2/neu gene amplification using FISH, and to correlate the results with immunohistochemical expression and clinical-pathological findings.;One hundred and ninety-nine ESCC cases were evaluated using the Tissue Microarray (TMA) technique. A polyclonal antibody against c-erbB-2 was used for immunohistochemistry. Analyses were based on the membrane staining pattern. The results were classified according to the Herceptest criteria (DAKO): negative (0/1+), potential positive (2+) and positive (3+). The FISH reactions were performed according to the FISH HER2 PharmDx (DAKO) protocol. In each case, 100 tumor nuclei were evaluated. Cases showing a gene/CEN17 fluorescence ratio > or = 2 were considered positive for gene amplification.;The c-erbB-2 expression was negative in 117/185 cases (63.2%) and positive in 68 (36.8%), of which 56 (30.3%) were 2+ and 12 (6.5%) were 3+. No significant associations were found among protein expression, clinicopathological data and overall survival. Among the 47 cases analyzed, 38 (80.9%) showed no gene amplification while 9 (19.1%) showed amplification, as demonstrated by FISH. Cases that were negative (0/1+) and potential positive (2+) for c-erbB-2 expression by immunohistochemistry showed no gene amplification. However, all cases with gene amplification were positive (3+) by immunohistochemistry. According to univariate analysis, there was a significant difference (p = 0.003) in survival rates when cases with and without HER-2/neu amplification were compared.;Our data demonstrate the correspondence between gene amplification and protein expression of HER-2/neu.

A validated assay for EGFR copy number in EC is needed, to allow investigation of EGFR copy number gain as a predictive biomarker for the anti-EGFR responsive subgroup of patients.

These receptors consist of an extracellular domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and an intracellular portion with a juxtamembrane segment, a protein kinase domain, and a carboxyterminal tail. The ErbB proteins function as homo and heterodimers. Growth factor binding to EGFR induces a large conformational change in the extracellular domain. Two ligand-EGFR complexes unite to form a back-to-back dimer in which the ligands are on opposite sides of the aggregate. Following ligand binding, EGFR intracellular kinase domains form an asymmetric dimer. The carboxyterminal lobe of the activator kinase of the dimer interacts with the amino-terminal lobe of the receiver kinase thereby leading to its allosteric stimulation. Several malignancies are associated with the mutation or increased expression of members of the ErbB family including lung, breast, stomach, colorectal, head and neck, and pancreatic carcinomas. Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are orally effective protein-kinase targeted quinazoline derivatives that are used in the treatment of ERBB1-mutant lung cancer and lapatinib is an orally effective quinazoline derivative used in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies that target the extracellular domain of ErbB2 are used for the treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancer and monoclonal antibodies that target ErbB1 and are used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Cancers treated with these targeted drugs eventually become resistant to them, and a current goal of research is to develop drugs that are effective against drug-resistant tumors. ",

EGFR was found to be overexpressed in 60-86% of gastric or gastroesophageal tumors and in 50-70% of esophageal cancers. Cetuximab was shown to be a radiosensitizing agent in the treatment of ENT neoplasia. These results led to several phase II encouraging therapeutic trials evaluating the combination of cetuximab with radiochemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancers. Numerous encouraging phase II trials evaluating cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction cancer were reported. These promising results are still to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III trials. Several studies reported HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer (7-34%), which appeared to be associated with poorer prognosis. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular HER2 domain. The international phase III trial known as ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile of trastuzumab in combination with first-line chemotherapy in HER2-overexpressing gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. Angiogenesis is an essential step in the initial phase of tumorigenesis, and it is normally absent from healthy tissues except for particular physiological situations, such as wound healing. VEGF-A plays a role in endothelial growth and angiogenesis. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF-A antibody, is currently being studied for gastric cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases have important roles in maintaining normal epithelial cell function. The ErbBs are involved in the interaction between cells and cell-matrix adhesion molecules and have proven critical in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial cell environment. Deregulation of these tyrosine receptors has been associated with several human diseases. In particular, the expression or activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 is altered in many epithelial tumors. Epithelial (E)-cadherin is another major molecule expressed by epithelial cells. To create efficient cell-cell adhesion, E-cadherin couples its cytoplasmic domain to catenins and the actin cytoskeleton. The loss of intercellular adhesion appears to be a fundamental aspect of the neoplastic phenomena. In addition, EGFR and ErbB2 signaling associated with the E-cadherin-catenin complex has been demonstrated in normal and cancer cells. This signaling is involved in regulating cell adhesion and the invasive growth of cancers. This article provides an overview of the interaction between the ErbB tyrosine receptors and the E-cadherin-catenin complex in human carcinomas.",

We show that deletion of Lrig1 is sufficient to promote murine airway hyperplasia through loss of contact inhibition and that re-expression of LRIG1 in human lung cancer cells inhibits tumourigenesis. LRIG1 regulation of contact inhibition occurs via ternary complex formation with EGFR and E-cadherin with downstream modulation of EGFR activity. We find that LRIG1 LOH is frequent across cancers and its loss is an early event in the development of human squamous carcinomas. Our findings imply that the early stages of squamous carcinoma development are driven by a change in amplitude of EGFR signalling governed by the loss of contact inhibition.",

Here, we report the co-amplification of EGFR and ERBB2 in an ulcerative and infiltrating-type SCC that measured approximately 4.2 × 2.7 × 1.2 cm with a superficial lesion occurring in the thoracic esophagus of a 72-year-old man. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification using representative tumor sections showed gain of CCND1 and coincident amplification of ERBB2 or EGFR or neither. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the tumor comprised three cancer-cell populations: well-differentiated SCC with high-level ERBB2 amplification and ERBB2 overexpression, more infiltrative poorly-differentiated SCC with high-level EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression, and poorly-differentiated SCC lacking any ERBB2 or EGFR abnormality. These three populations each had low-level CCND1 amplification and nuclear cyclin D1 overexpression. This histological topology and gene amplification combinations suggested that genetic instability first produced CCND1 amplification, and then ERBB2 or EGFR gene amplification occurred. It is further speculated that during cancer progression and clonal selection indecisive predominance of either clone caused the rare co-amplification of ERBB2 and EGFR in a single chimeric tumor.",

This is in contrast to the traditional picture of ErbB1 dimers standing proud of the membrane, but in line with recent FRET and EM experiments. Interaction with the membrane leads to conformational changes in the dimer, which further stabilize the back-to-back interface. On the membrane, two dimers can associate forming a tetramer. This is enabled by a head-to-head interface, involving the ligand binding side of the ectodomain, and which significantly enhances ligand binding. A weak head-to-head interface has been seen in crystal structures, but is found to stabilise appreciably in our simulation. We also find that the domains IV, connecting the receptor to the membrane, weakly interact with each other. These simulations illustrate some of the flexibility of the ErbB1 ectodomains, and may help to explain recent experimental results.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent inducer of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, it remains elusive about which molecular mechanisms determine the cellular capacity to undergo EMT in response to TGF-beta. We have found that both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression and mutant p53 tumor suppressor genes contribute to the enrichment of an EMT-competent cellular subpopulation among telomerase-immortalized human esophageal epithelial cells during malignant transformation. EGFR overexpression triggers oncogene-induced senescence, accompanied by the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15(INK4B), p16(INK4A), and p21. Interestingly, a subpopulation of cells emerges by negating senescence without loss of EGFR overexpression. Such cell populations express increased levels of zinc finger E-box binding (ZEB) transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2, and undergo EMT on TGF-beta stimulation. Enrichment of EMT-competent cells was more evident in the presence of p53 mutation, which diminished EGFR-induced senescence. RNA interference directed against ZEB resulted in the induction of p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A), reactivating the EGFR-dependent senescence program. Importantly, TGF-beta-mediated EMT did not take place when cellular senescence programs were activated by either ZEB knockdown or the activation of wild-type p53 function. Thus, senescence checkpoint functions activated by EGFR and p53 may be evaded through the induction of ZEB, thereby allowing the expansion of an EMT-competent unique cellular subpopulation, providing novel mechanistic insights into the role of ZEB in esophageal carcinogenesis.",

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is produced by mesenchymal cells and stimulates MET, which is present on the surface of epithelial cells. HGF-MET signaling directs the proliferation and migration of epithelial cells during the development of various organs and is important during wound healing. Aberrant MET activation has been implicated in several types of cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma. Using a model in which mice overexpressing HGF develop spontaneous squamous cell carcinomas in the skin, Cataisson et al found that MET promoted the development of squamous tumors by stimulating the synthesis and release of ligands that activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This mechanism was similar to that through which oncogenic RAS promotes skin tumors. Blocking EGFR signaling caused HGF-induced squamous tumors to regress, suggesting that EGFR inhibitors might be useful for treating squamous cell carcinomas.Listen to Podcast. ",

However, patients who achieved pathological complete response can experience more survival benefit. Therefore, it is critical to identify the responders early in the course of treatment. Published data demonstrate that clinic-histopathological factors, molecular biomarkers, and functional imaging are predictive of neoadjuvant therapy. The existing biomarkers, including epidermal growth factor receptors, angiogenetic factors, transcription factors, tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle regulators, nucleotide excision repair pathway, cytokines, and chemotherapy associated genes, need to be validated and novel biomarkers warrant further exploration. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for differentiating the responders of neoadjuvant CRT. The most valuable parameters and the time point of performing PET in the course of treatment remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, predictive models incorporating the multiple categories of factors need to be established with a large, prospective, and homogeneous patient cohort in the future. Standardization of staging, biomarker detection method, and image acquisition protocol will be critical for the generalization of this model. Prospective, multi-center controlled trials, which stratified patients according to these predictive factors, will help guide individualized treatment strategies for patients with esophageal cancer.

The aims of the present study were to evaluate STAT3 activation (p-STAT3 protein levels) in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and to investigate its correlation with clinicopathologic features of these malignancies.;Expression of p-STAT3 was detected by immunohistochemistry in tissue from 127 lung carcinomas (100 adenocarcinomas and 27 squamous cell carcinomas) and 56 normal lungs.

Positive p-STAT3 expression was detected in 82 of the 127 carcinomas (64.6%) but in only 21 of the 56 normal tissue samples (37.5%).

In contrast, only 20% of adenocarcinomas and foci of epithelial hyperplasia expressed elevated levels of TGF-alpha. Many neoplasms expressing TGF-alpha also expressed excessive levels of EGFR mRNA. Southern and DNA slot blot analyses showed that the elevated EGFR expression was not due to amplification of the EGFR gene. These data suggest that increased amounts of TGF-alpha were early alterations in the progression of plutonium-induced squamous cell carcinoma, and these increases may occur in parallel with overexpression of the receptor for this growth factor.

In cultured keratinocytes activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor upregulates expression of Bcl-x(L), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog. The functional contribution of epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent Bcl-x(L) expression to keratinocyte survival is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity with either an epidermal growth factor receptor antagonistic monoclonal antibody (MoAb 425) or an epidermal growth factor receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (AG 1478) downregulated Bcl-x(L) expression in normal human keratinocytes but had no effect on expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologs Bad, Bak, and Bax. Bovine pituitary extract and insulin partially alleviated both, downregulation of Bcl-x(L) expression and cell death upon epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition. Forced expression of Bcl-x(L) attenuated cell death of immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) induced by either forced suspension (anoikis) or by epidermal growth factor receptor blockade. These results demonstrate that epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent signaling pathways control the balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members expressed in normal keratinocytes.

NIRF-QDs with an emission wavelength of 800 nm (NIRF-QD800) were conjugated with EGFR monoclonal antibodies to develop the QD800-EGFR Ab probe. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the QD800-EGFR Ab probe can specifically bind EGFR expressed on U14 cells. U14 squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck can be clearly visualized by in vivo imaging after intravenous injection of QD800-EGFR Ab probes.

Monitoring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) conformation by anisotropy microscopy together with cell-free reconstitution of cytohesin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation indicate that cytohesins facilitate conformational rearrangements in the intracellular domains of dimerized receptors. Consistent with cytohesins playing a prominent role in ErbB receptor signaling, we found that cytohesin overexpression correlated with EGF signaling pathway activation in human lung adenocarcinomas.

A panel of gastric and esophageal cancer cell lines was treated with wortmannin as an Akt-signal inhibitor; the MAPK signal inhibitor PD98059; lapatinib, which inhibits both the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 tyrosine kinase; or siRNA for MAPK. The levels of HER2-signaling molecules, APM components, and HLA class I were evaluated by Western blot, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry. Resected gastric tumor tissues (n = 102) were analyzed for p-Erk and HLA class I expression by immunohistochemistry. As a result, inhibition of the MAPK pathway induced upregulation of HLA-A02 and HLA-A24 expression in parallel with an increase in APM components and enhanced target sensitivity to tumor Ag-specific CTL lysis. HLA-A expression was predominantly regulated by the MAPK pathway, but it was also influenced, in part, by the Akt pathway.

Structural insights into HER1 in epithelial cells, derived from FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy) and two-dimensional FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) combined with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, have demonstrated a high-affinity ligand-binding HER1 conformation consistent with the extracellular region aligned flat on the plasma membrane.

A radical surgical approach combined with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is the generally accepted treatment for this tumor. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor modulating the cell proliferation and biological progression of many human epithelial tumors. The EGFR overexpression in PSCCT suggests an additional therapeutic option for the treatment of this tumor.;The clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical profiles of two cases of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid in a 66-year-old and an 83-year-old woman are presented. EGFR status was valued in both cases.;Overexpression of EGFR protein was detected in 50% and 75% of the tumor cell membranes. EGRF gene polysomy was detected in both tumors.;Pharmaceuticals targeting EGFR may help to provide the rationale for an additional, novel therapeutic option for this rare tumor, especially when other therapeutic options have been exhausted.",

The current study investigated the association between the IGF1R genetic variants, the occurrence of EGFR mutations, and clinicopathological characteristics in NSCLC patients.

The hybrid human protein was isolated from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies, refolded and purified to homogeneity. The fusion protein competed with 125I-hEGF for binding to hEGF receptors (EGFR) and had ribonucleolytic activities approaching those of hpRNase1. Several conformations having different enzymatic activities could be detected after reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis, the less hydrophobic molecules being the most active. The hybrid protein was specifically cytotoxic to A431, an EGFR overexpressing squamous carcinoma cell line, with an IC50 of approximately 10(-7) M. In contrast, recombinant hpRNase1 had an IC50 higher than 10(-4) M. A mixture of free hEGF and free hpRNasel was not more cytotoxic than hpRNasel alone and no cytotoxicity was detected in EGFR-deficient control cells. Taken together, these data suggest that this construct might be useful for targeted therapy of esophageal, lung and other squamous cell carcinomas and also breast cancers overexpressing EGFR, which correlate with a poor prognosis and cannot be cured by surgery alone. Engineering hybrid molecules with endogenous human proteins for targeted therapy may alleviate the dose-limiting immunogenicity and toxicity of conventional immunotoxins.",

Targeted agents such as cetuximab and erlotinib are currently used in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but, in this disease, the genomic alterations that cause pathway activation and determine response to pharmacologic inhibition remain ill-defined. Here, we present a detailed dissection of the EGFR/PI3K pathway, composed of sequencing of the core pathway components, and high-resolution genomic copy number assessment. Mutations were found in PIK3CA (6%), but no point mutations were observed in other pathway genes such as PTEN and EGFR. In contrast, we observed frequent copy number alterations of genes in the pathway, including PIK3CA, EGFR, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor S (PTPRS), and RICTOR. In total, activating genetic pathway alterations were identified in 74% of head and neck tumors. Importantly, intragenic microdeletions of the EGFR phosphatase PTPRS were frequent (26%), identifying this gene as a target of 19p13 loss. PTPRS loss promoted EGFR/PI3K pathway activation, modulated resistance to EGFR inhibition, and strongly determined survival in lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations. These findings have important implications for our understanding of head and neck cancer tumorigenesis and for the use of targeted agents for this malignancy.",

In addition, EGFR inhibitors have shown significant promise for patients who failed cisplatin-based therapy. In this study, we investigated whether treatment with an EGFR inhibitor improves cisplatin sensitivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. The effects of a combination of AG1478, a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with cisplatin were evaluated in cultured OSCC cell lines and cisplatin-resistant sublines. Higher expression of EGFR and p-EGFR was found in the two cisplatin-resistant cell lines compared with the corresponding parental cell lines. In addition, augmented inhibition of OSCC cell growth by the combination of AG1478 with cisplatin was found in both cell lines.

Amplification and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at 7p12 and fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) at 11q13 were found. To understand the correlation between these two genes in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) more comprehensively, overexpression of FGF3 and EGFR was investigated by immunohistochemistry with a tissue microarray containing 406 NSCLC samples. Cytoplasmic overexpression of FGF3 and EGFR was detected in 61% and 69% NSCLC cases, respectively. More interestingly, a significant correlation between overexpression of FGF3 and EGFR was found in NSCLC.;These results suggest that co-overexpression of FGF3 and EGFR may play an important role in the pathogenesis of lung carcinoma.",

In a chemical genetics screen for small molecule activators of Notch signalling, we identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a key negative regulator of Notch1 gene expression in primary human keratinocytes, intact epidermis and skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The underlying mechanism for negative control of the Notch1 gene in human cells, as well as in a mouse model of EGFR-dependent skin carcinogenesis, involves transcriptional suppression of p53 by the EGFR effector c-Jun. Suppression of Notch signalling in cancer cells counteracts the differentiation-inducing effects of EGFR inhibitors while, at the same time, synergizing with these compounds in induction of apoptosis. Thus, our data reveal a key role of EGFR signalling in the negative regulation of Notch1 gene transcription, of potential relevance for combinatory approaches for cancer therapy.",

Fork-head box O (FOXO) transcription factors, Akt downstream effectors, are important regulators of cell growth. Here, we hypothesized that FOXO1 might be crucial in quercetin-induced growth inhibition in EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer. Quercetin treatment suppressed cell growth by inducing G2 arrest and apoptosis in EGFR-overexpressing HSC-3 and TW206 oral cancer cells. Quercetin inhibited EGFR/Akt activation with a concomitant induction of FOXO1 activation. FOXO1 knockdown attenuated quercetin-induced p21 and FasL expression and subsequent G2 arrest and apoptosis, respectively. Likewise, quercetin suppressed tumor growth in HSC-3 xenograft mice.

Therapies that target EGFR can promote the dimerization of EGFR with other ErbB receptors, which is associated with the development of drug resistance. Understanding how interactions among ErbB receptors alter EGFR biology could provide avenues for improving cancer therapy. We found that EGFR interacted directly with the CYT1 and CYT2 variants of ErbB4 and the membrane-anchored intracellular domain (mICD). The CYT2 variant, but not the CYT1 variant, protected EGFR from ligand-induced degradation by competing with EGFR for binding to a complex containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and the adaptor Grb2. Cultured breast cancer cells overexpressing both EGFR and ErbB4 CYT2 mICD exhibited increased migration. With molecular modeling, we identified residues involved in stabilizing the EGFR dimer. Mutation of these residues in the dimer interface destabilized the complex in cells and abrogated growth factor-stimulated cell migration. An exon array analysis of 155 breast tumors revealed that the relative mRNA abundance of the ErbB4 CYT2 variant was increased in ER+ HER2- breast cancer patients, suggesting that our findings could be clinically relevant. We propose a mechanism whereby competition for binding to c-Cbl in an ErbB signaling heterodimer promotes migration in response to a growth factor gradient.",

Synchronous lung cancers from 60 patients (42 with adenocarcinoma and 18 with squamous cell carcinoma), clinically considered to represent intrapulmonary metastases, were histologically subtyped according to the 2015 World Health Organization classification of lung tumors and subjected to genotypic analysis (KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, MET and ROS1 in adenocarcinoma and PIK3CA and p16 in squamous cell carcinoma). Concordance between clinical criteria and histological subtyping was identified in about 50% of cases (P<0.0001). Genotypically, 44% of adenocarcinomas and 60% of squamous cell carcinomas with identified molecular alterations were considered to be intrapulmonary metastases. Concordance between histological and molecular staging was observed in 89% of adenocarcinomas and 56% of squamous cell carcinomas. Univariate survival analyses failed to demonstrate significant differences in overall or cancer-specific survival in patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomas restaged according to histology and/or molecular profile. Lymph node metastases (N1/N2 vs N0) (P=0.03) and age >65 years (P=0.05) were associated with shorter overall survival. In addition, squamous cell carcinomas with p16 deletion showed shorter overall survival when compared with squamous cell carcinomas without p16 deletion (P=0.05).

The aim of this study was to assess the mutational profile in each component of 16 adenosquamous carcinoma samples from a Caucasian population by a combination of next generation sequencing using the cancer hotspot panel as well as the colon and lung cancer panel and FISH. Identified mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of DNA from cancer cells of each component collected by Laser Capture microdissection. Mutations typical for adenocarcinoma as well as squamous cell carcinoma were identified. Driver mutations were predominantly in the trunk suggesting a monoclonal origin of adenosquamous carcinoma. Most remarkably, EGFR mutations and mutations in the PI3K signaling pathway, which accounted for 30% and 25% of tumors respectively, were more prevalent while KRAS mutations were less prevalent than expected for a Caucasian population. Surprisingly, expression of classifier miR-205 was intermediate between that of classical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma suggesting that adenosquamous carcinoma is a transitional stage between these tumor types. The high prevalence of therapy-relevant targets opens new options of therapeutic intervention for adenosquamous carcinoma patients. ",

The higher potency of quercetin was also observed downstream on the level of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. In addition, delphinidin, quercetin and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) were found to suppress the phosphorylation of the ErbB2 receptor, with delphinidin exhibiting the strongest inhibitory properties. Their potency to suppress the ErbB2 receptor phosphorylation can be summarised as delphinidin > EGCG > quercetin. The effectiveness of delphinidin against the EGFR and the ErbB2 receptor was comparable, indicating a broader spectrum of activity against receptor tyrosine kinases. At low micromolar concentrations delphinidin showed some preference towards the ErbB2 receptor. In summary, quercetin and delphinidin appear to differ in their activity profile towards the ErbB receptor family members.

Resection of the metastatic site identified LCNEC that retained the original EGFR mutation. Immunohistochemistry revealed the loss of expression of EGFR and retinoblastoma (Rb) in the LCNEC.;This case highlights acquisition of EGFR-TKI resistance by transformation to LCNEC, not SCLC.

The conjugation of radionuclides to cetuximab in combination with the specific targeting properties of this antibody might increase its therapeutic efficiency. This review article gives an overview of the preclinical studies that have been performed with radiolabeled cetuximab for imaging and/or treatment of different tumor models. A particularly promising approach seems to be the treatment with therapeutic radionuclide-labeled cetuximab in combination with external radiotherapy. Present data support an important impact of the tumor micromilieu on treatment response that needs to be further validated in patients. Another important challenge is the reduction of nonspecific uptake of the radioactive substance in metabolic organs like liver and radiosensitive organs like bone marrow and kidneys. Overall, the integration of diagnosis, treatment and monitoring as a theranostic approach appears to be a promising strategy for improvement of individualized cancer treatment. ",

Recently, mutant Ras was shown to be capable of activating ErbB receptors in a ligand-independent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that nucleolin, a transcriptional regulator and ribosome biogenesis factor, can bind both K-Ras and the cytoplasmic tail of ErbB receptors to enhance ErbB receptor activation. However, the functional significance of these interactions to cancer pathogenesis has not been probed. Here, we show that endogenous nucleolin interacts simultaneously in vivo with endogenous Ras and ErbB1 (EGFR) in cancer cells. The C-terminal 212 amino acids of nucleolin were determined to be sufficient to interact with ErbB1 and all Ras protein isoforms (H-, N-, and K-Ras). Nucleolin partially colocalizes with Ras at the plasma membrane. Moreover, activated but not wild-type Ras facilitates nucleolin interaction with ErbB1 and stabilizes ErbB1 receptor levels. Most importantly, these three oncogenes synergistically facilitate anchorage-independent cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.

EGFR overexpression is associated with reduced survival and is inversely correlated with expression of estrogen receptor (ER). This study assessed EGFR expression in breast carcinomas with squamous differentiation. The immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of EGFR was evaluated in 39 breast carcinomas with squamous differentiation (30 pure squamous, 6 adenosquamous, 3 carcinosarcomas) by use of the pharmDx assay (clone 2-18C9, DakoCytomation). Cases were considered positive if at least 10% of the cells showed 1+ positivity in the squamous component. Squamous differentiation was confirmed with IHC for CK5-6 (clone D5/16B4, DakoCytomation). ER, PR, and HER2 status as well as clinical information regarding treatment and outcome were correlated. As a control, a tissue microarray comprising 280 lymph node positive breast carcinomas was evaluated with the same EGFR assay. The 39 patients ranged in age from 33 to 77 years (mean 52). The tumors measured 1.3-30 cm (mean 4.8). Sentinel or full axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 28 patients. Fourteen patients had positive lymph nodes. At the time of initial diagnosis, 3 patients had distant metastasis. Follow-up was available for 16 patients (mean 45 months). Disease-free survival at 3 years was 70%. Among the 39 tumors 87% (34) were positive for EGFR (p<0.0001). Sixty-nine percent (27 of 39) showed >50% 2+ EGFR staining. EGFR-positive tumor cells (showing squamous morphology) were also found in 1 bone, 1 lung, and 8 of 11 lymph node metastases available for evaluation. All 11 lymph nodes showed squamous differentiation. All but 1 of the EGFR+ tumors examined were ER and PR negative. Six EGFR-positive tumors were HER2 positive. No statistically significant differences in HER2 status, size, lymph node status and disease-free survival were observed between EGFR+ and EGFR- cases, but the number of EGFR-negative tumors was quite small. Nine of 280 (3%) of lymph node-positive invasive carcinomas on the tissue microarray were EGFR+; review of the initial diagnostic slides failed to reveal squamous features in all but 1 of the 9 EGFR+ tumors. Breast carcinomas with squamous differentiation are a distinct subgroup of breast tumors with a very high frequency of EGFR positivity. Breast carcinomas of this type would be ideal candidates for a trial with EGFR inhibitors.",

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1) belongs to the ErbB/HER-family of tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs). These trans-membrane proteins are activated following binding with peptide growth factors of the EGF-family of proteins. Several evidences suggest that cooperation of multiple ErbB receptors and ligands is required for the induction of cell transformation. In this respect, EGFR, upon activation, sustains a complex and redundant network of signal transduction pathways with the contribution of other trans-membrane receptors. EGFR has been found to be expressed and altered in a variety of malignancies and clearly it plays a significant role in tumor development and progression, including cell proliferation, regulation of apoptotic cell death, angiogenesis and metastatic spread. Moreover, amplification of the EGFR gene and mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been recently reported in human carcinomas. As a result, investigators have developed approaches to inhibit the effects of EGFR activation, with the aim of blocking tumor growth and invasion. A number of agents targeting EGFR, including specific antibodies directed against its ligand-binding domain and small molecules inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity are either in clinical trials or are already approved for clinical treatment. This article reviews the EGFR role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression as rational bases for the development of specific therapeutic inhibitors.",

The neural progenitor cells of these regions express the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB-1 or HER1). EGF, the most important ligand for the EGFR, is a potent mitogenic agent that stimulates proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation into the oligodendrocyte lineage. Other ErbB receptors also activate several intracellular pathways for oligodendrocyte specification, migration and survival. However, the specific downstream pathways related to oligodendrogenesis and the hierarchic interaction among intracellular signaling cascades is not well-known. We summarize the current data regarding the role of EGFR and ErbB family signaling on neural stem cells and the downstream cascades involved in oligodendrogenesis in the neurogenic niches of the adult brain. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate proliferation, differentiation, migration of oligodendrocytes and myelination is of critical importance for the field of neurobiology and constitutes a crucial step in the design of stem-cell-based therapies for demyelinating diseases.

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of lung cancer is often made late in the course of the disease, with almost 70% of patients presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of the malignancy, occurring in up to 85% of cases. There are 3 subtypes of NSCLC: squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma. Enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of NSCLC has led to substantial improvements in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic interventions for NSCLC. The discovery of targetable molecular alterations in genes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has driven the evolution of targeted therapies for NSCLC and shifted treatment paradigms for the disease. This article will summarize the epidemiology and pathophysiology of NSCLC, its associated gene mutations and biomarkers, and the approach to treatment, with a focus on patients whose tumors harbor EGFRactivating mutations.

The focus of SCCHN therapy has more recently shifted to the molecular level, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) pathway. Several agents that target the EGFR pathway, including monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are under investigation for SCCHN. Searches of PubMed and results of key oncology congresses were performed to identify relevant articles and abstracts. The EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody cetuximab is approved for the treatment of locally advanced SCCHN in combination with radiotherapy, for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and 5-fluorouracil, and for recurrent or metastatic SCCHN following progression with platinum-based chemotherapy. Other investigational EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies (e.g., panitumumab, nimotuzumab, zalutumumab) are in clinical development for SCCHN. Inhibition of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR has also been explored as a therapeutic approach in SCCHN using small-molecule reversible inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. However, a key challenge in SCCHN is the development of resistance, and strategies are being pursued to delay or overcome resistance to EGFR-targeted agents. These strategies include development of agents that inhibit multiple ErbB receptors simultaneously (e.g., lapatinib) or that bind multiple ErbB family receptors irreversibly (e.g., afatinib, PF-00299804) and investigation of combinations of agents that target multiple pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of SCCHN.

Likewise, the expression of EGFR greatly varied, by as much as 21-fold, and the magnitude of the EGFR expression positively correlated with increased tumor radioresistance. The levels of EGFR inversely correlated with radiation-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the lack of sensitivity to apoptosis induction was a major mechanism responsible for radioresistance of tumors with high EGFR. This correlation was highly significant only for wild-type p53 carcinomas. Radiation activated EGFR autophosphorylation and increased the activity of protein tyrosine kinase, but only in tumors with high EGFR expression. Thus, EGFR expression was a major determinant of tumor radioresponse in vivo. The pretreatment assessment of EGFR expression could predict radiotherapy outcome and may assist in selecting an effective treatment modality.",

As STAT 3 activation as well contributes to the cell growth in SCCHN, the interaction of STAT 3 and the EGFR is of great interest when considering treatment options through inhibition of STAT 3. We, therefore, evaluated the influence of blocking or activating the EGFR in human SCCHN cell lines and in vivo tumors on STAT 3 activation. We compared the effects on STAT 3 activation with the regulation of MAP Kinase under these conditions. We found that STAT 3 can be strongly inhibited via EGFR blocking in vitro as well as in vivo. However, the influence of EGFR regulation on the MAP Kinase pathway seemed to be very slight. These findings provide evidence that STAT 3 signal activity in head and neck carcinomas, which is partially responsible for proliferative activity, can be controlled via the EGFR.",

Here, we reported significant decrease in microRNA (miRNA)-34a and significant increase in phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) in the resected gastric carcinoma from the patients, compared with adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, strong correlation was detected among these three factors. To examine whether a causal link exists, we used two human gastric carcinoma lines, SNU-5 and HGC27, to study the molecular basis of miRNA-34a, EGFR signaling, and MMP7 activation. We found that EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation in SNU-5 or HGC27 cells activated MMP7 and consequently cancer invasiveness. Both an inhibitor for EGFR and an inhibitor for Akt significantly inhibited the EGF-induced activation of MMP7, suggesting a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade dependent pathway. Moreover, miRNA-34a levels were not affected by EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation. However, overexpression of miRNA-34a antagonized EGF-induced MMP7 activation without affecting EGFR phosphorylation in SNU-5 or HGC27 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that miRNA-34 inhibits EGFR signaling via downstream PI3K signaling cascades to regulate MMP7 expression in gastric carcinoma. Thus, miRNA-34a, EGFR, and MMP7 appear to be promising therapeutic targets for preventing the metastasis of gastric carcinoma.",

Many of these receptors are overexpressed or amplified in various forms of cancers. Previous studies have indicated that activation of erbB molecules contributes to malignant transformation both by promoting cell proliferation through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling pathway and by preventing apoptosis through the Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) pathway. Disabling erbB receptors converts malignant cells that were resistant to cell death caused by irradiation to cells that are sensitive to apoptosis. Here, we report that an activated form of EGFR can elevate the levels of Survivin, a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family implicated in mitotic checkpoint control. Conversely, inactivation of the ErbB receptors reduces the expression levels of Survivin. Furthermore, we found that upregulation of Survivin by EGFR is dependent on the PI-3 kinase pathway but not on the MAP kinase pathway. Indeed, inhibition of PI-3 kinase can diminish Survivin at both the mRNA and the protein levels. Combined with previous findings that Survivin plays a role in control of chromosome segregation and that it is overexpressed in various cancers, our results suggest that EGFR may cause transformation by directly affecting mitosis and increasing chromosome instability.",

In NSCLCs, EGFR mutations were detected in 75 cases (53.2%) and were significantly associated with adenocarcinoma, female sex, and never smoking. Among adenocarcinomas, nonmucinous and mucinous BAC components were significantly associated with EGFR and K-ras gene mutations, respectively. Because EGFR mutations were detected even in most pure nonmucinous BACs, ie, lung adenocarcinoma in situ, EGFR mutation is considered a critical event in the pathogenesis of nonmucinous BAC tumors.",

In North America, lung cancer has become more predominant among former than current smokers. Yet in some countries, such as China, which has experienced a dramatic increase in the cigarette smoking rate during the past 2 decades, a peak in lung cancer incidence is still expected. Approximately two-thirds of adult Chinese men are smokers, representing one-third of all smokers worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases in the United States. After the initial diagnosis, accurate staging of non-small cell lung cancer using computed tomography or positron emission tomography is crucial for determining appropriate therapy. When feasible, surgical resection remains the single most consistent and successful option for cure. However, close to 70% of patients with lung cancer present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy is beneficial for patients with metastatic disease, and the administration of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation is indicated for stage III lung cancer. The introduction of angiogenesis, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, and other new anti-cancer agents is changing the present and future of this disease and will certainly increase the number of lung cancer survivors.

We initially confirmed that breast tumour tissues express all five somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5) and four epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1-4). Subsequently, to gain insight into the function of SSTRs and ErbBs in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7) or ERalpha-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells, we defined SSTR1, SSTR5 and ErbB1 mRNA and protein expression in these two tumour cell lines. Consistent with previous studies showing SSTR1/SSTR5 heterodimerization and having seen cell-specific and ligand-selective alterations in receptor expression, we next elucidated whether SSTR1 and SSTR5 functionally interact with ErbB1 using pbFRET analysis. We subsequently determined the effects of SST and EGF either alone, or in combination, on selected downstream signalling molecules such as erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Here, we showed that both SST and EGF influenced erk1/2 phosphorylation and that SST modulated the effects of EGF in a cell-specific manner. We also demonstrated agonist-, time and cell-dependent regulation of p38 phosphorylation. We further investigated modulation of Grb2, SOS, Shc, SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2. ErbB1 adaptor proteins known to play a role in MAPK activation, Shc, Grb2 and SOS, changed in an agonist- and cell-specific manner whereas, SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2, adaptor proteins reported to interact with SSTRs, translocated from the cytosol to membrane in a cell-specific manner following SST and/or EGF treatment. Although several previous studies have shown crosstalk between RTKs and GPCRs, there are no reports describing SSTR (GPCR) modulation of ErbBs (RTK) in breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing crosstalk/interactions between SSTRs and ErbBs.",

In this study, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of a therapeutic anti-ErbB3 antibody, MM-121. We found that MM-121 effectively blocked ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3 induced by either EGFR, HER2, or MET. Assessment of several cancer cell lines revealed that MM-121 reduced basal ErbB3 phosphorylation most effectively in cancers possessing ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. In those cancers, MM-121 treatment led to decreased ErbB3 phosphorylation and, in some instances, decreased ErbB3 expression. The efficacy of single-agent MM-121 was also examined in xenograft models. A machine learning algorithm found that MM-121 was most effective against xenografts with evidence of ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. We subsequently investigated whether MM-121 treatment could abrogate resistance to anti-EGFR therapies by preventing reactivation of ErbB3. We observed that an EGFR mutant lung cancer cell line (HCC827), made resistant to gefitinib by exogenous heregulin, was resensitized by MM-121. In addition, we found that a de novo lung cancer mouse model induced by EGFR T790M-L858R rapidly became resistant to cetuximab. Resistance was associated with an increase in heregulin expression and ErbB3 activation. However, concomitant cetuximab treatment with MM-121 blocked reactivation of ErbB3 and resulted in a sustained and durable response. Thus, these results suggest that targeting ErbB3 with MM-121 can be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancers with ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains challenging. Non‑surgical approaches typically comprise radiotherapy and antineoplastic chemotherapy, of which platinum‑based agents are the most common. Similar to other malignancies, targeted therapies have an increasing role in the treatment of head and neck cancer. The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a useful target for specific therapeutic strategies. Resistance to EGFR‑directed therapies, including cetuximab, is partly mediated by the activation of alternative receptors and pathways. Therefore, other members of the ErbB family, including human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 and HER4, may have important therapeutic roles. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of afatinib, an EGFR/HER2/HER4 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with cisplatin in HNSCC cell lines. The cisplatin concentration used was set at cell line‑specific half maximal inhibitory concentration values. Since the vast majority of head and neck cancers do not exhibit any EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations, five human EGFR wild‑type HNSCC cell lines were used in the present study. For statistical analyses, non‑parametric Mann‑Whitney tests were conducted. The present study detected a concentration‑dependent efficacy of afatinib. In three out of the five cell lines (PCI‑9, PCI‑52 and PCI‑68), 0.625 µM afatinib in combination with cisplatin exerted significant antiproliferative effects. In the two other cell lines (PCI‑1 and PCI‑13), significant effects were observed following treatment with ≥1.25 µM afatinib. Notably, compared with the findings of previous studies, cell lines (PCI-9 and PCI-52) less vulnerable to erlotinib or gefitinib were more vulnerable to the afatinib/cisplatin combination, and vice versa. Differences in the treatment success of erlotinib/gefitinib (targeting only EGFR) and afatinib (targeting EGFR, HER2 and HER4) may be explained by mutations in the EGFR. Therefore, afatinib treatment may be considered an important therapeutic option for patients failing cetuximab treatment. In addition, the present study demonstrated significant enhancement of platinum‑based therapies upon the addition of various afatinib concentrations. These results provide preclinical evidence to advocate further in vivo studies and clinical trials.",

After conversion to squamous cell carcinoma, the cells remain sensitive to detachment-induced anoikis, yet in tumor cell aggregates, which are matrix-deficient, these cells are capable of suprabasal survival and proliferation. Their survival is enhanced through a process we call synoikis, whereby junctional adhesions between neighboring cells generate specific downstream survival signals. Here we show that in squamous cell carcinoma cells, E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts specifically induce activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR activation in turn triggers the ERK/MAPK signaling module, leading to elevation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. After intercellular adhesion, formation of adherens junctions triggers the formation of E-cadherin-EGFR complexes, correlating with EGFR transactivation. Analysis of the process with a dominant-negative EGFR mutant indicated that activation of EGFR is ligand-independent. Our data implicate cell-cell adhesion-induced activation of EGFR as a cooperative mechanism that generates compensatory survival signaling, protecting malignant cells from detachment-induced death.",

Limited information is available on the contribution of Rho GTPases to heregulin-mediated signaling. In breast cancer cells, heregulin beta1 (HRG) causes a strong activation of Rac; however, it does so with striking differences in kinetics compared to epidermal growth factor, which signals through ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]). Using specific ErbB receptor inhibitors and depletion of receptors by RNA interference (RNAi), we established that, surprisingly, activation of Rac by HRG is mediated not only by ErbB3 and ErbB2 but also by transactivation of EGFR, and it is independent of ErbB4. Similar receptor requirements are observed for HRG-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and mitogenic activity via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). HRG-induced Rac activation was phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependent and Src independent. Furthermore, inactivation of Rac by expression of the Rac GTPase-activating protein beta2-chimerin inhibited HRG-induced ERK activation, mitogenicity, and migration in breast cancer cells. HRG mitogenic activity was also impaired by depletion of Rac1 using RNAi. Our studies established that Rac is a critical mediator of HRG mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cells and highlight additional levels of complexity for ErbB receptor coupling to downstream effectors that control aberrant proliferation and transformation.",

American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends performing EGFR mutation testing in all patients; European Society for Medical Oncology, College of American Pathologists/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/Association for Molecular Pathology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest for some selected group. EGFR mutation is rarely found in LSQC; however, more importantly, it is not a valid predictive biomarker for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) in LSQC as it has been shown in LADC. Available data showed that the response rate and progression-free survival in EGFR mutant LSQC patients treated with EGFR-TKI are not better than that observed in patients treated with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Therefore, in contrast to advanced LADC, EGFR mutation testing may not be necessarily performed upfront in advanced LSQC because not only the mutation rate is low, but also the predictive value is insufficient.

        "Doc_abstract":"The prognostic value of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in gastric cancer is controversial. Consensus guidelines have standardized the testing of HER2 status in gastric cancer. Overexpression of this receptor occurs in approximately 20% of gastric and gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinomas, predominantly those of the intestinal type. Recently, trastuzumab has emerged as the first targeted drug to improve overall survival when combined with chemotherapy in advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer. Primary and secondary resistance to trastuzumab has become a major problem and new strategies to overcome this resistance are needed. A high percentage of advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer patients who progress on trastuzumab therapy are candidates for second-line therapy. New families of targeted drugs, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as lapatinib and PF-00299804, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitors such as everolimus, heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors such as AUY922, HER dimerization inhibitors such as pertuzumab, and antibody-chemotherapy conjugates such as trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1), could offer alternative second-line treatments when trastuzumab-based first-line therapy fails.",

We investigated how NDRG1/Cap43 could affect tumor growth and angiogenesis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in vivo using an animal experimental model, and also how it could affect tumor angiogenesis and prognosis in NSCLC patients.;Knockdown of NDRG1/Cap43 in lung cancer cells using a specific small interfering RNA resulted in growth rates in culture that were similar to those of counterpart control cells, but decreased tumor growth rates in vivo markedly. Stable NDRG1/Cap43 knockdown did not induce consistent changes in the expression of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family proteins and c-Met in two human lung cancer cell lines in vitro. However, cell lines with NDRG1/Cap43 knockdown showed markedly decreased production of the potent angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor-A and interleukin-8. Cells with knockdown of NDRG1/Cap43 showed marked reduction of tumor-induced angiogenesis. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined 182 surgically resected specimens of NSCLC for expression of NDRG1/Cap43 and tumor angiogenesis. High microvessel density in the tumor was significantly associated with nuclear positivity for NDRG1/Cap43 in both adenocarcinoma (p = 0.003) and squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.041). For both adenocarcinoma (p = 0.031) and squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.034), the survival curve of patients negative for nuclear NDRG1/Cap43 expression differed significantly from that of patients who were positive.;Therefore, the expression of NDRG1/Cap43 may be predictive of tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis in NSCLC.",

This high expression correlates with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Experimental and clinical findings suggest that aberrant activation of tyrosine receptor kinases, such as HER1 pathway, play a causal role in the development of antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer. Recent preclinical and clinical evidence shows that inhibition of growth factor signaling pathways suppresses the growth of malignant cells without serious toxicities. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of the HER1 signaling pathway enhances the antitumor effect of endocrine therapy, a promising signal transduction inhibitor (STI) of HER1 tyrosine kinase, gefitinib, and an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, fulvestrant, were administered to human breast cancer cells. Our experimental results have revealed that gefitinib additively enhances the antitumor effect of fulvestrant in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells under estrogen-supplemented conditions. An additive increase in the protein expression level of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 may play a key role of this additive cytostatic effect. The rationale and future perspectives of the combined use of STIs with endocrine therapy in breast cancer are discussed.",

Yet, fundamental differences in the development of the two different entities have been and are currently unveiled. The constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway by acquired mutations in the PTCH and SMO genes appears to represent the early basal cell carcinoma developmental determinant. Although other signaling pathways are also affected, small hedgehog inhibitory molecules evolve as the most promising basal cell carcinoma treatment options systemically as well as topically in current clinical trials. For squamous cell carcinoma development mutations in the p53 gene, especially UV-induced mutations, have been identified as early events. Yet, other signaling pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor, RAS, Fyn, or p16INK4a signaling may play significant roles in squamous cell carcinoma development.

PAI-1 induction occurs early in the progression of incipient epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and is a significant indicator of poor prognosis in epithelial malignancies.

All the cases showed loss of p16 protein. In three of these cases the loss was attributed to an exon 2 homozygous deletion in the p16/CDKN2a gene. The majority of the cases had loss of Dpc4 protein and strong nuclear p53 positivity, similar to the molecular signature found in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We found that E-cadherin was either lost or reduced in all cases and that epidermal growth factor receptor was overexpressed in all cases. The squamous component was positive for p63 staining and thus p63 labeling was helpful in identifying squamous differentiation in adenosquamous carcinomas with an acantholytic growth pattern.

Sialidase, a key enzyme for the regulation of cellular sialic acids through catalyzing the initial step of degradation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, has been implicated in cancer progression. To facilitate the development of novel treatments for HNSCC, we have investigated whether sialidase is involved in the progression of this cancer. We found plasma membrane-associated sialidase (NEU3) to be significantly upregulated in tumor compared to non-tumor tissues; particularly, an increase in its mRNA levels was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. To understand the mechanisms, we analyzed the NEU3-mediated effects on the malignant phenotype using squamous carcinoma HSC-2 and SAS cells. NEU3 promoted cell motility and invasion, accompanied by the increased expression of MMP-9, whereas NEU3 silencing or the activity-null mutant did not. NEU3 enhanced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and an EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, abrogated the NEU3-induced MMP9 augmentation. These findings identify NEU3 as a participant in HNSCC progression through the regulation of EGFR signaling and thus as a potential target for inhibiting EGFR-mediated tumor progression. ",

Using molecular biological techniques, we compared the incidence and mechanism of TGF-alpha and EGFR over-production in fresh tumors and histologically normal mucosal specimens from patients with SCCHN and normal, control patients without cancer. In patients with SCCHN, TGF-alpha and EGFR mRNA levels were significantly elevated in both tumor and normal mucosal specimens as compared to levels in control mucosa from non-cancer patients. Neither an enhancement of message stability nor an increase in gene copy number alone accounted for the elevation of EGFR mRNA.

Human skin, cultured normal keratinocytes, and A431 skin carcinoma cells expressed ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3, but not ErbB4. Skin and A431 cells expressed more ErbB3 than did keratinocytes. Despite strong expression of ErbB2 and ErbB3, heregulin was inactive in stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation in A431 cells. In contrast, it was highly active in MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cells. ErbB2 displayed punctate cytoplasmic staining in A431 and keratinocytes, compared to strong cell surface staining in MDA-MB-453. In skin, ErbB2 was cytoplasmic in basal keratinocytes, assuming a cell surface pattern in the upper suprabasal layers. In contrast, ErbB1 retained a cell surface distribution in all epidermal layers. Keratinocyte proliferation in culture was found to be ErbB1-RTK-dependent, using a selective inhibitor. These results suggest that in skin keratinocytes, ErbB2 transduces ligand-dependent differentiation signals, whereas ErbB1 transduces ligand-dependent proliferation/survival signals.

ZD1839 ('Iressa') is an orally active, selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in proliferation and survival of cancer cells, and other host-dependent processes promoting cancer growth. Here, growth arrest was observed with 3.64 microm ZD1839. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (sMTT) viability assay revealed a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in the percentage of surviving cells upon treatment with ZD1839 and cisplatin compared with cisplatin or ZD1839 on their own. Combined therapy of 3.64 microm ZD1839 for 24 h, prior to administration of 100 microm cisplatin, significantly (P < 0.001) and additively increased the cytotoxicity effect of cisplatin. p53-independent apoptosis was seen with cisplatin treatment, a novel finding. These data support the use of ZD1839 in anti-cancer therapy, and particularly in combination therapy. Cisplatin may induce p53-independent apoptosis.

To date, the expression of EGFR and HER2 has not been evaluated in primary cutaneous spindle squamous cell carcinoma (SSC). In extracutaneous spindle squamous cell carcinoma, there is evidence implicating the expression of RTK as a strong, independent prognostic indicator of potentially poor outcome. The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression of EGFR and HER2 in SSC, using immunohistochemical methods.;Thirteen cases of primary nonmetastatic cutaneous SSC archived at a large veterans' hospital and tertiary referral dermatopathology service were retrieved via a computer-assisted search. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the presence of EGFR and/or HER2 expression. All cases were confirmed before study by a single, board-certified dermatopathologist.;All 13 cases (100%) evaluated for the presence of HER2 were nonimmunoreactive for the receptor. Only one of the 13 cases (<8%) stained positive for EGFR.;In several malignancies, the overexpression EGFR and HER2 is associated with clinically aggressive behavior. Despite a limited sample size, EGFR and HER2 are not overexpressed in SSC; this is cognate with the current opinion that SSC possesses limited metastatic potential.

Ultraviolet light plays a fundamental role as an initiator and promoter of carcinogenesis of SCC, allowing the accumulation of genetic alterations that allows a selective growth advantage. The TP53 (p53) gene often mutates and Ras is frequently activated, but with low frequency of mutations. Normally, the extracellular signals determine whether the cells move from a quiescent state into an active proliferative state. In tumor cells an increase in the production of growth factors and its receptors can be often seen that gives rise to such an autocrine circuit facilitating cellular division. Recently, frequent mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been detected in lung cancer, mainly deletions in exon 19 and L858R mutation in exon 21. These are located at the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (TK). EGFR TK mutations produce activation of the signaling pathways downstream and preferentially activated antiapoptotic pathways (PI3K/AKT, JAK-STAT and ERK/MAPK). These mutations are correlated with the clinical response of patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefinitib and erlotinib), because the tumor cells are addicted to the constant activation of specific signaling pathways. Glioblastoma shows another EGFR mutation (EGFRvIII), corresponding to a deletion of the extracellular domain, and it is present in 24-67% of these tumors. This variant has been found in 42% of HNSCC, related to the poor response to monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Many observations show that there are abnormalities in the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or its ligands in HNSCC with frequent activation of multiple pathways downstream EGFR, and unrelated to RAS mutation. This suggests the possibility of activation by mutation or overexpression of a component of the pathway located upstream-Ras. While in other tumors, especially lung cancer and glioblastoma, the EGFR mutations are frequent genetic events, it is unknown whether EGFR is mutated or amplified in SCC of the skin and what would be its pathogenic role in this malignancy and its precursors.",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether ORI could improve the anticancer efficacy of Cet on LSCC. We observed that the combination with Cet and ORI synergistically inhibited cell growth associated with Fas-mediated apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest in two LSCC cell lines (HEp-2 and Tu212 cells). Moreover, combination treatment caused cell death associated with suppression of p-EGFR and activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated JNK pathway. In nude mice bearing HEp-2 xenografts, ORI plus Cet caused a significant tumor regression through induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation with no side-effect.

Moreover, treatment with cetuximab results in a marked inhibition of tumour growth in nude mice bearing xenografts of human cancer cell lines. These results are linked to cetuximab biological effects as inhibition of cell cycle, tumour progression, neo-angiogenesis, invasion and metastatization, as well as increase and activation of pro-apoptotic molecules. Additionally, cetuximab potentiates, in combination, the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in eradicating well-established tumours in nude mice and it may even reverse the resistance to some cytotoxic agents in these xenografts. Moreover, numerous clinical trials demonstrated cetuximab efficacy in different tumour types. It has been approved by Food and Drugs Administration in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy, in locally and regionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in combination with radiation, and as monotherapy for recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma after failing platinum-based chemotherapy.

Our findings were as follows: 1. The serum levels of VEGF and ES in Han patients were obviously higher than those of Uygur and Kazakh patients (P < 0.05). The VEGF positive rate in patients at a later clinical stage was higher than that of the patients at an earlier clinical stage (stages II-IV were 14.29, 50.00, and 50.00%, respectively, P < 0.05), meanwhile it was higher than that of patients without lymph node metastases (78.13 vs 25.00%, P < 0.05). The curative effective rate of patients with negative expression of VEGF was higher than that of patients with positive expression of VEGF (74.67 vs 41.40%, P < 0.05). 2.

Receptor activation leads to recruitment and phosphorylation of several downstream intracellular substrates, leading to mitogenic signaling and other tumor-promoting cellular activities. In human tumors, receptor overexpression correlates with a more aggressive clinical course. Taken together, these observations indicate that the EGFR is a promising target for cancer therapy. Monoclonal antibodies directed at the ligand-binding extracellular domain and low-molecular weight inhibitors of the receptor's tyrosine kinase are currently in advanced stages of clinical development. These agents prevent ligand-induced receptor activation and downstream signaling, which results in cell cycle arrest, promotion of apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. They also enhance the antitumor effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In patients, anti-EGFR agents can be given safely at doses that fully inhibit receptor signaling, and single-agent activity has been observed against a variety of tumor types, including colon carcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Although antitumor activity is significant, responses have been seen in only a minority of the patients treated. In some clinical trials, anti-EGFR agents enhanced the effects of conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

ErbB1 amplification and mutation are associated with tumor development and are implicated in ineffective treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the ErbB1 copy number affects EGFR expression, cell proliferation or cell migration by comparing two different cell lines.;The copies of ErbB1 gene was evaluated by FISH. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting were performed to determine location and expression of proteins mentioned in the present study. Proliferation was studied by flow cytometry and cell migration by wound healing assay and time lapse.;We investigated the activation and function of EGFR in the A549 and HK2 lung cancer cell lines, which contain 3 and 6 copies of ErbB1, respectively. The expression of EGFR was lower in the HK2 cell line. EGFR was activated after stimulation with EGF in both cell lines, but this activation did not promote differences in cellular proliferation when compared to control cells. Inhibiting EGFR with AG1478 did not modify cellular proliferation, confirming previous data. However, we observed morphological alterations, changes in microfilament organization and increased cell migration upon EGF stimulation. However, these effects did not seem to be consequence of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition.;EGFR expression did not appear to be associated to the ErbB1 gene copy number, and neither of these aspects appeared to affect cell proliferation.

This signalling route is distinct from the better-characterized, traditional EGFR pathway that involves transduction of mitogenic signals through activation of multiple signalling cascades. Transcriptional activity of nuclear EGFR appears to depend on its C-terminal transactivation domain and its physical and functional interaction with other transcription factors that contain DNA-binding activity. Likely via its ability to upregulate gene expression, nuclear EGFR pathway is associated with major characteristics of more aggressive tumours: increased proliferative potential, nitric oxide synthesis, and accelerated G1/S cell cycle progression. A role of nuclear EGFR in prognostic prediction is further suggested in patients with breast carcinomas and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. It is noted that significant advances were made towards the knowledge of the nuclear EGFR pathway; however, many aspects of this new pathway remain unresolved and will be discussed in this review. As a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytokine receptors also undergo similar nuclear translocalization, a better understanding of the physiological and malignant nature of the nuclear EGFR pathway will likely shed light into the biology of cancer with nuclear RTKs.",

In addition to mitogenic ability, we demonstrate in this report that EGF protects a human esophageal carcinoma (CE) cell line, CE81T/VGH, from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic signal of EGF is alleviated by a MEK inhibitor PD98059 or an ERK2 dominant negative mutant but not by a phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, v-raf blocks apoptosis induced by staurosporine. This evidence implies that the survival signal of EGF is mediated via the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway but not the PI3-K pathway. The survival effect of EGF is coincident with the induction of mcl-1, an antiapoptotic gene in the bcl-2 family. PD98059 also suppresses the induction of Mcl-1 by EGF, implying that EGF may up-regulate Mcl-1 via the MAP kinase pathway. Overexpression of mcl-1 is sufficient to protect against apoptosis, while transfection of a mcl-1 antisense plasmid causes cell death. The expression of mcl-1 antisense plasmid also suppresses the anti-apoptotic effect of EGF. Taken together, these results indicate that EGF may up-regulate Mcl-1 through the MAP kinase pathway to suppress apoptosis.",

In contrast, 60.9% of adenomas and 59.6% of carcinomas almost completely lacked metallothionein expression. In the series of adenocarcinomas, metallothionein expression was inversely correlated with CD44 in neoplastic cells (p = 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference of metallothionein expression, or the other variables examined, between adenocarcinomas and adenomas.;Metallothionein expression does not seem to indicate aggressive biological behaviour in colorectal adenocarcinomas, in comparison with the other types of carcinoma.

In total, 55 breast carcinomas morphologically diagnosed as apocrine were evaluated for the steroid receptor expression profile characteristic of normal apocrine epithelium (androgen receptor positive/estrogen receptor (ER) negative/progesterone receptor (PR) negative), and for the expression of EGFR and Her-2/neu proteins, and the copy number ratios of the genes EGFR/CEP7 and HER-2/CEP17. On the basis of the results of steroid receptors expression, 38 (69%) cases were classified as pure apocrine carcinoma (androgen receptor positive/ER negative/PR negative), whereas 17 (31%) were re-classified as apocrine-like carcinomas because they did not have the characteristic steroid receptor expression profile. Her-2/neu overexpression was observed in 54% of the cases (57% pure apocrine carcinomas vs 47% apocrine-like carcinomas). HER-2/neu gene amplification was demonstrated in 52% of all cases (54% pure apocrine carcinomas vs 46% apocrine-like carcinomas). EGFR protein (scores 1 to 3+) was detected in 62% of all cases and was expressed in a higher proportion of pure apocrine carcinomas than in the apocrine-like carcinomas group (76 vs 29%, P=0.006). In the pure apocrine carcinoma group, Her-2/neu and EGFR protein expression were inversely correlated (P=0.006, r=-0.499). EGFR gene amplification was observed in two pure apocrine carcinomas and one apocrine-like carcinoma. Polysomy 7 was commonly present in pure apocrine carcinomas (61 vs 27% of apocrine-like carcinomas; P=0.083) and showed a weak positive correlation with EGFR protein expression (P=0.025, r=0.326). Our study showed that apocrine breast carcinomas are molecularly diverse group of carcinomas. Strictly defined pure apocrine carcinomas are either HER-2-overexpressing breast carcinomas or triple-negative breast carcinomas, whereas apocrine-like carcinomas predominantly belong to the luminal phenotype. Pure apocrine carcinomas show consistent overexpression of either EGFR or HER-2/neu, which could have significant therapeutic implications.",

Furthermore, we examined the inhibition effect of curcumin on EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation and SCC-25 cells invasion. Our results showed that curcumin inhibited SCC-25 cells proliferation and induced G2/M phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Curcumin also inhibited SCC-25 cells invasion and downregulated MMP-2, MMP-9, uPA and uPAR expression. We further revealed that curcumin regulated the p-EGFR and EGFR downstream signaling molecules including Akt, ERK1/2 and STAT3. Finally, our data showed that crucumin reduced the EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and suppressed EGF-triggered SCC-25 cells invasion.

For this reason, a key issue in laryngeal oncology is to assess metastatic potential of squamous cell carcinoma at diagnosis. Nevertheless, the combination of clinical and histological parameters is not sufficiently reliable in the prediction of lymph node metastases. Molecular characterization, by the study of molecular predictive factors, is a clinical approach aimed to define homogeneous subgroups for clinical metastatic behaviour.

The two most common mutations that account for greater than 85% of all EGFR gene mutations are in-frame deletions in exon 19 (LREA deletions) and substitution in exon 21 (L858R). Exon 18 mutations occur much less frequently at about 4% of all EGFR gene mutations. Together, exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R gene substitution are present in about 10% of Caucasian patients and 20-40% of Asian patients with non-small cell lung cancer. T790M gene mutation at exon 20 is associated with acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Early studies showed that activating EGFR gene mutations are most common in patients with adenocarcinoma histology, women, never smokers and those of Asian ethnicity. A recent multi-center phase III trial suggested that frontline epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy with afatinib is associated with improved progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy regardless of race. Moreover, guidelines now suggest EGFR gene mutation testing should be conducted in all patients with lung adenocarcinoma or mixed lung cancers with an adenocarcinoma component, regardless of characteristics such as smoking status, gender or race. The success of targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer patients has changed the treatment paradigm in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, despite a durable response of greater than a year, resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors inevitably occurs. This mini-review describes the clinically relevant EGFR gene mutations and the efficacy/toxicity of small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors as targeted therapies for these gene mutations. Therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance, including emerging and novel therapies, are discussed. ",

We investigated whether EGFR expression levels could predict for response to gefitinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who received gefitinib (250 mg day(-1)) as part of a worldwide compassionate-use programme. Tissue samples were analysed by immunohistochemistry to assess membrane EGFR immunoreactivity. Of 147 patients enrolled in our institution, 50 patients were evaluable for assessment of both clinical response and EGFR expression. The objective tumour response rate was 10% and disease control was achieved in 50% of patients. Although high EGFR expression was more common in squamous-cell carcinomas than adenocarcinomas, all objective responses were observed in patients with adenocarcinoma. Response and disease control with gefitinib were not associated with high EGFR expression. Overall, median survival was 4 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 18%. Strong EGFR staining correlated with shorter survival time for all patients. Gefitinib demonstrated promising clinical activity in this group of patients with NSCLC. These results have also shown that EGFR expression is not a significant predictive factor for response to gefitinib.",

The treatment of early disease depends primarily on surgery. In addition, certain patients present with extensive local invasion or metastasis, which renders these tumours surgically unresectable. Improving the outcome of radiotherapy through the use of concurrent systemic therapy has been demonstrated in several locally advanced cancer-treatment paradigms. Recently, agents targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have exhibited a consolidated activity in phase II clinical trials and case series reports. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and completely inhibits the EGFR, which has been revealed to be up-regulated in a variety of SCCs, including NMSCs. The present review aimed to summarize the role of anti-EGFR agents in the predominant types of NMSC, including SCC and BCC, and focuses on the cetuximab-based studies, highlighting the biological rationale of this therapeutic option. In addition, the importance of the association between cetuximab and radiotherapy for locally advanced NMSC is discussed.",

Major improvements have been accomplished in surgical techniques and radiotherapy delivery. Moreover, systemic therapy including chemotherapy and molecularly targeted agents--namely, the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors--has been successfully integrated into potentially curative treatment of locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In deciding which treatment strategy would be suitable for an individual patient, important considerations include expected functional outcomes, ability to tolerate treatment, and comorbid illnesses.

Expression has been associated with malignant progression, inhibition of apoptosis, neoplastic angiogenesis, enhanced metastatic potential, and both chemoresistance and radioresistance. IMC-C225 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets extracellular epidermal growth factor receptor; it has shown both in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in tumor cells lines expressing epidermal growth factor receptor, including heightened radiation response in vitro in cultured human squamous cell carcinoma and enhancement of taxane- and platinum-induced cytotoxicity in non-small cell lung cancer xenografts. In A431 head and neck squamous cell xenografts, IMC-C225 administered both before and after radiation therapy yields a radiation enhancement factor of 3.62, attributable to both tumor necrosis and antiangiogenesis. In phase I pharmacokinetic studies, IMC-C225 has a long half-life, lending itself to convenient weekly administration. It has shown a favorable toxicity profile, limited primarily to allergic and dermatologic reactions, the latter characterized by a self-limited, sterile, acneiform rash. Anaphylaxis is rare. Standard treatment entails a loading dose of 400 mg/m(2) at week 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m(2) weekly. An ongoing phase III international multicenter, randomized study in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is evaluating therapeutic radiation therapy, either alone or in conjunction with IMC-C225. In a pilot trial, six of nine patients with platinum-exposed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck exhibited objective response. In an ongoing phase II trial in patients with stable or progressive disease on platinum-based therapy, the preliminary response rate is approximately 20%, far higher than one would expect with standard salvage regimens. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group has completed a placebo-controlled phase III registration trial assessing cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks with or without IMC-C225. Three separate phase II trials in non-small cell lung cancer have been launched: one trial tests IMC-C225 in combination with standard paclitaxel/carboplatin; another integrates IMC-C225 into the gemcitabine/carboplatin combination in treatment-naive patients; and a third trial evaluates IMC-C225 in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks in the second-line setting.",

In a previous study, we showed that telomerase is frequently activated in skin tumors. Because epidermal growth factor plays an important role during the tumorigenesis of epithelial tissue, we have now examined the role of epidermal growth factor signaling in regulating telomerase activity using HSC-1 human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells. Treatment of HSC-1 cells with AG 1478, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor, or with a neutralizing antibody to the epidermal growth factor receptor, significantly suppressed their telomerase activity, in association with inhibiting their growth. The suppression of telomerase activity was obvious at day 3 and was maximal at day 5 after treatment with AG 1478. The suppression of telomerase activity correlated with the decreased expression of human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) mRNA, the rate-limiting determinant of its enzyme activity. The expression of c-Myc and of Sp1 proteins, transcription factors for hTERT, were also suppressed by AG 1478 in HSC-1 cells, but the expression of Ets-2 protein, another transcription factor, was not affected. The expression of Mad-1, a competitor of c-Myc, was increased. Inhibition of ERK, Src, or Akt suppressed telomerase activity in HSC-1 cells, but to a lesser extent than did treatment with AG 1478. Serum starvation suppressed telomerase activity, but addition of epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor alpha did not increase it, indicating the involvement of other epidermal growth factor receptor ligands in the activation of telomerase in HSC-1 cells. These data indicate that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor might be effective in inhibiting telomerase activity of squamous cell carcinomas, which would lead to the suppression of tumor growth.",

Furthermore, constitutive activation of EGFR-Akt-mTOR was found in 17.9% of nonsmall cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). For each protein, the frequencies of the activation vary among histologic types. In adenocarcinoma (AC), 90% revealed mTOR activation regardless of EGFR status, and 60% of these showed activation of downstream S6K/rS6. Furthermore, mutation of EGFR was frequently accompanied by phosphorylation of EGFR and constitutive activation of entire EGFR through rS6 was observed in 50% of carcinoma harboring EGFR mutation, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). By clinicopathologic analysis, Akt activation was correlated with lymph node metastasis in general, but nodal metastasis was correlated with rS6 activation in AC and with mTOR activation in SCC. In conclusion, (i) constitutive activation of EGFR/Akt/mTOR pathway was present in defined subset of NSCLC; (ii) mTOR/S6K/rS6 axis is frequently activated in AC, and constitutively activated through Akt by EGFR mutation even in SCC; and (iii) mTOR and rS6 are possible determinants of nodal metastasis in SCC and AC, respectively.",

It also inhibits transphosphorylation of HER3. Oral afatinib (Gilotrif™) has been approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have tumours with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations as detected by a US FDA-approved test. Afatinib has also been approved in Taiwan for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In addition, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended the approval of afatinib (Giotrif®) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations who are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor naïve. Afatinib is also under regulatory review in Canada, Japan and other Asian countries.

In particular, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands have been implicated in the growth and dissemination of a wide array of human carcinomas. Here, we describe an EGFR-mediated signaling pathway that regulates human pancreatic carcinoma cell invasion and metastasis, yet does not influence the growth of primary tumors. In fact, ligation/activation of EGFR induces Src-dependent phosphorylation of two critical tyrosine residues of p130CAS, leading to the assembly of a Crk-associated substrate (CAS)/Nck1 complex that promotes Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1) signaling. Importantly, GTP loading of Rap1 is specifically required for pancreatic carcinoma cell migration on vitronectin but not on collagen. Furthermore, Rap1 activation is required for EGFR-mediated metastasis in vivo without impacting primary tumor growth.

After double blocking, by the process of fetal bovine serum deprivation and vincristine treatment, MNs formation was monitored with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, which is an S-phase marker. Statistical analyses allowed us to infer that MNs may arise both in mitosis as well as in interphase. The MNs were able to replicate their DNA and this process seemed to be non-synchronous with the main cell nuclei. The presence of ErbB1 gene in the MNs was evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). ErbB1 sequences were detected in the MNs, but a relation between the MNs formation and extrusion of amplified ErbB1 could not be established.

The molecular mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression are largely not understood and precursor lesions have not yet been identified. In this study, pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas were cytogenetically characterized as well as by molecular and immunohistochemical analyses. Corresponding investigations were carried out on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms augmented by functional analyses. We show that pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas display a microsatellite stable, chromosomal unstable genotype, characterized by recurrent chromosomal imbalances that clearly discriminate them from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine neoplasms. Based on findings obtained from comparative genomic hybridization, candidate genes could be identified, such as deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and c-MYC. Furthermore, several therapeutic targets were identified in acinar cell carcinomas and other pancreatic neoplasms, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Moreover, L1CAM was shown to play a significant role in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Functional analyses in cell lines derived from pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms revealed promising anti-tumorigenic effects using EGFR and HSP90 inhibitors affecting the cell cycle and in the case of HSP90, regulating several other oncogenes.

Epithelial tumours are often found to concurrently express the receptor to TGF-alpha, namely epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), at elevated levels. The simultaneous expression of TGF-alpha and EGFR by the carcinoma cells is thought to trigger the autocrine growth pathway, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation. Similar observations of elevated TGF-alpha/EGFR expression have been detected in oral squamous carcinomas from human and animal sources. By RNA blotting analyses, elevated levels of TGF-alpha/EGFR expression have been consistently observed with malignant human and hamster oral cancers. Interestingly, by use of cellular localisation techniques of in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, we have shown that there is another, previously unnoticed, cellular source of TGF-alpha at oral tumour sites. Eosinophils are a major cellular source of this growth factor in oral cancer and their presence is tightly associated with malignant oral epithelium. Furthermore, transformed oral epithelium in vivo has been shown to be associated with elevated levels of EGFR expression.

        "Doc_abstract":"Integrin α6β4 is up-regulated in pancreatic adenocarcinomas where it contributes to carcinoma cell invasion by altering the transcriptome. In this study, we found that integrin α6β4 up-regulates several genes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, including amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and ectodomain cleavage protease MMP1, which is mediated by promoter demethylation and NFAT5. The correlation of these genes with integrin α6β4 was confirmed in The Cancer Genome Atlas Pancreatic Cancer Database. Based on previous observations that integrin α6β4 cooperates with c-Met in pancreatic cancers, we examined the impact of EGFR signaling on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulated migration and invasion. We found that AREG and EREG were required for autocrine EGFR signaling, as knocking down either ligand inhibited HGF-mediated migration and invasion. We further determined that HGF induced secretion of AREG, which is dependent on integrin-growth factor signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and PKC. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase activity and integrin α6β4 signaling were required for AREG secretion. Blocking EGFR signaling with EGFR-specific antibodies or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor hindered HGF-stimulated pancreatic carcinoma cell chemotaxis and invasive growth in three-dimensional culture. Finally, we found that EGFR was phosphorylated in response to HGF stimulation that is dependent on EGFR kinase activity; however, c-Met phosphorylation in response to HGF was unaffected by EGFR signaling. Taken together, these data illustrate that integrin α6β4 stimulates invasion by promoting autocrine EGFR signaling through transcriptional up-regulation of key EGFR family members and by facilitating HGF-stimulated EGFR ligand secretion. These signaling events, in turn, promote pancreatic carcinoma migration and invasion.",

CSCC is rarely problematic, but given its high frequency, the absolute number of complicated cases is also high. It is necessary to identify molecular markers to recognize those CSCC with poor prognosis. There is controversy concerning the role of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) as a marker of prognosis in CSCC. In addition, EGFR-targeted therapies have emerged in recent years and a better understanding of the role of EGFR in CSCC may help some patients in predicting prognosis and guide curative management.;We evaluated clinical and histopathological features, including events of bad clinical evolution, in a series of 94 CSCC. We also analysed EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry, FISH and QPCR.;We detected EGFR in 85 (90.4%) cases, with overexpression in 33 (35.1%) cases, and aberrant EGFR expression in the cytoplasm in 50 (53.1%) cases. EGFR overexpression in the primary tumours was associated with lymph node progression, TNM stage progression and proliferation (Ki-67 staining) in CSCC. EGFR overexpression and poor grade of differentiation were the strongest independent variables defining lymph node metastasis and progression in CSCC in a logistic regression model.;We demonstrate that EGFR overexpression has prognostic implications associated with lymph node metastasis and progression in CSCC.

This investigation was to evaluate the expression of EGFR, phosphorylated(p)-Akt and p-NF-kappaB and correlate them with clinical outcomes in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil. A total of 45 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil were studied by immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression levels of EGFR, p-Akt and p-NF-kappaB. Results for squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil were compared with those for associated high-grade dysplasia and adjacent normal appearing epithelium, when present. In addition, tonsillar epithelium from non-neoplastic specimens of age-matched patients also was stained for the same markers. High-grade dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil demonstrated a similar pattern of expression, which differed from the pattern seen in the adjacent normal epithelium and tonsillar epithelium from normal controls (an overexpression for each of these three protein analytes in high-grade dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry). When markers from squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil were correlated with survival status, only increasing levels of p-NF-kappaB immunoreactivity (a relative overexpression) were statistically significant predictors of poor survival. No markers in squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil were significantly related to rate of recurrence. When analyzing marker scores from tissue with high-grade dysplasia, relative overexpressions of both p-Akt and p-NF-kappaB were significantly related to poor survival. Additionally, increasing levels of p-NF-kappaB immunopositivity from tissue with high-grade dysplasia were also significantly related to rate of recurrence. In summary, p-NF-kappaB, overexpressed in high-grade dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil, is associated with worse prognosis in terms of high recurrence and poor survival, respectively. This significant finding in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil, in combination with previous animal and in vitro studies, suggests that p-NF-kappaB represents a potential therapeutic target in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",

A PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane literature search was performed. Studies describing a relation between a cell biological marker and survival in ≥50 cervical cancer patients primarily treated with (chemo)radiation were selected. Study quality was assessed, and studies with a quality score of 4 or lower were excluded. Cell biological markers were clustered on biological function, and the prognostic and predictive significance of these markers was described. In total, 42 studies concerning 82 cell biological markers were included in this systematic review. In addition to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-ag) levels, markers associated with poor prognosis were involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (EGFR and C-erbB-2) and in angiogenesis and hypoxia (carbonic anhydrase 9 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α). Epidermal growth factor receptor and C-erbB-2 were also associated with poor response to (chemo)radiation. In conclusion, EGFR signaling is associated with poor prognosis and response to therapy in cervical cancer patients primarily treated with (chemo)radiation, whereas markers involved in angiogenesis and hypoxia, COX-2, and serum SCC-ag levels are associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, targeting these pathways in combination with chemoradiation may improve survival in advanced-stage cervical cancer patients.",

In particular, cancers with specific EGFR-activating mutations seem to be the most sensitive to these agents.

In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a novel compound, PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor. The results from these studies show that PF00299804 is a potent inhibitor of EGFR-activating mutations as well as the EGFR T790M resistance mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, PF00299804 is a highly effective inhibitor of both the wild-type ERBB2 and the gefitinib-resistant oncogenic ERBB2 mutation identified in lung cancers.

We examined the effect of the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) gefitinib (\"Iressa\") in combination with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT-11 (irinotecan) on human colorectal cancer cells. EGFR mRNA and protein expression were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting in all 7 colorectal cancer cell lines studied. Gefitinib inhibited the cell growth of the cancer cell lines in vitro with an IC(50) range of 1.2-160 microM by 3,(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Lovo cells exhibited the highest level of protein and autophosphorylation of EGFR and were the most sensitive to gefitinib. The combination of gefitinib and CPT-11 induced supra-additive inhibitory effects in COLO320DM, WiDR and Lovo cells, assessed by an in vitro MTT assay. Administration of gefitinib and CPT-11 had a supra-additive inhibitory effect on WiDR cells and tumor shrinkage was observed in Lovo cell xenografts established in nude mice, whereas no additive effect of combination therapy was observed in COLO320DM cells. To elucidate the mechanisms of synergistic effects, the effect of CPT-11-exposure on phosphorylation of EGFR was examined by immunoprecipitation. CPT-11 increased phosphorylation of EGFR in Lovo and WiDR cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. This EGFR activation was completely inhibited by 5 microM gefitinib and gefitinib-induced apoptosis was enhanced by combination with CPT-11, measured by PARP activation although no PARP activation was induced by 5 microM CPT-11 alone. These results suggested that these modification of EGFR by CPT-11, in Lovo cells, is a possible mechanism for the synergistic effect of CPT-11 and gefitinib. These findings imply that the EGFR-TKI gefitinib and CPT-11 will be effective against colorectal tumor cells that express high levels of EGFR, and support clinical evaluation of gefitinib in combination with CPT-11, in the treatment of colorectal cancers.",

Based on these findings, and the fact that aberrant expression of erbB family members is common in human prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive PCA, we reasoned that impairment of erbB1 endocytosis and associated mitogenic signaling might inhibit PCA growth. Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) interacts with plasma membrane clathrin-associated protein complex 2 (AP2) and inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). As these are essential components of receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis, respectively, we reasoned that IP6 might impair erbB1 endocytosis and associated signaling in human PCA cells, leading to their growth inhibition. IP6 strongly to completely inhibited (26-100%; P < 0.05) transforming growth factor alpha-induced binding of activated erbB1 to AP2 in human PCA DU145 cells, demonstrating the impairment of the initial step in ligand-induced erbB1 endocytosis. IP6 treatment of cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase (1.8- to 7. 7-fold compared with cells treated with ligand alone; P < 0.05) in levels of activated erbB1. These two findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of IP6 on receptor endocytosis is independent of its lack of effect on ligand-induced erbB1 activation. These effects of IP6, however, were associated with strong inhibition of ligand-induced Shc phosphorylation (77-84% decrease; P < 0.05) and its binding to erbB1 (58-100% decrease; P < 0.05). IP6 also significantly and dose-dependently inhibited fluid-phase endocytosis (19-52%; P < 0.05). It inhibited PI3K-AKT signaling pathway as an upstream response in its effect on the inhibition of fluid-phase endocytosis. The inhibition of erbB1 receptor and fluid-phase endocytosis, and associated signaling by IP6, was corroborated by very strong to complete inhibition (70-100%; P < 0.05) of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 activation by IP6. IP6 significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent inhibition (50-100% and 30-75%, respectively) in DU145 cells. Targeting the impairment of erbB1 endocytosis and associated mitogenic signaling by IP6 in advanced and androgen-independent human PCA DU145 cells could be a useful approach for treating PCA.",

The phenotypic changes could be the result of dysregulation of growth control genes such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). With the goal of identifying a potential biomarker of the multistep process of tumorigensis, we studied specimens of 36 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas from 5 different sites that contained normal epithelia and/or premalignant lesions adjacent to the tumors. Almost all of the individuals from whom these specimens were obtained had been exposed to first-hand smoking and/or alcohol consumption. Using a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody for immunohistochemical analysis on paraffin-embedded sections with attached 886 cells for internal control, the levels of EGFR expression were assessed by image analysis. The relative staining intensity of EGFR in normal epithelia adjacent to tumors was 2-fold higher than that in normal control epithelium (P = 0.021), suggesting that, even in histologically normal epithelium, EGFR was already up-regulated in tissues surrounding tumors. These findings supported the theory of field cancerization in head and neck tumorigenesis. As tissue progressed from normal tissue adjacent to tumor to hyperplasia and to dysplasia, EGFR expression remained elevated. However, in the step from dysplasia to squamous cell carcinoma, EGFR expression was further and dramatically up-regulated (P = 0.01). Therefore, these results indicate that EGFR dysregulation happens in two steps, the moderate up-regulation of EGFR expression in normal epithelium adjacent to tumor and the further up-regulation of EGFR expression in the change from dysplasia to squamous cell carcinoma. In summary, the studies presented here indicate that EGFR dysregulation might be a useful marker for identifying individuals at risk of tumor development and an intermediate end point in chemoprevention trials.",

Serum markers of cancer (neuron-specific enolase, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125, cytokeratin fragment 21-1) were measured by an automated electrochemiluminescence system and molecular markers (multidrug resistance protein 1, LDL receptor-related protein, ribonucleotide reductase M1, epidermal growth factor receptor, excision repair cross-complementing gene 1, and breast cancer 1) were measured by immunohistochemistry of the primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes. The results indicate that the serum level of CEA was higher in NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma relative to those with squamous cell carcinoma, but no significant differences in the other serum markers. Expression of excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 was significantly different in the primary tumors and metastatic sites of NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma, but there were no other significant differences.

All patients received transurethral resection of the bladder, which demonstrated pure squamous cell carcinomas. Seven patients had clinical evidence of tumor spreading out of the bladder (T4) and did not undergo radical cystectomy. The other 9 patients underwent cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. The cystectomy specimens revealed tumors invading muscularis propria (T2) (n = 4) or perivesical soft tissue (T3) (n = 5). Two patients also had metastasis to lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that squamous cell carcinoma cells were positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (n = 16) and for p53 (n = 11). For the 9 patients who received cystectomy, 5 patients were alive at a mean of 92.8 months (range, 59-128 months) and 4 patients died of disease at a mean of 24.0 months (range, 6-58 months). For the 7 patients who did not receive cystectomy, 6 died at a mean of 5.7 months (range, 3-9 months), and no follow-up was available for the remaining patient.

However, as with other targeted therapies, intrinsic/acquired resistance mechanisms limit efficacy. In the FaDu HNSCC xenograft model, we show that combined blockade of EGFR and ERBB3 promotes rapid tumor regression, followed by the eventual outgrowth of resistant cells. RNA sequencing revealed that resistant cells express FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins, which were validated as drivers of the resistant phenotype by several approaches, including CRISPR-mediated inactivation of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion genes. Interestingly, analysis of signaling in resistant cell lines demonstrated that FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins promote resistance by preferentially substituting for EGFR/RAS/ERK signaling rather than ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, although FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins promote resistance of additional EGFR-dependent HNSCC and lung cancer cell lines to EGFR blockade, they are unable to compensate for inhibition of PI3K signaling in PIK3CA-mutant HNSCC cell lines. Validation of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins as endogenous drivers of resistance in our screen provides strong evidence that these fusions are capable of substituting for EGFR signaling. Thus, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins may represent a novel mechanism of acquired resistance in EGFR-dependent cancers of multiple cell lineages.Oncogene advance online publication, 27 June 2016 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.216.",

To examine the involvement of cell motility and the mechanism of this behavior, a squamous cell carcinoma cell line of the breast (HBC9) was established from a metastatic lymph node of a Japanese woman. HBC9 expressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but was negative for Her2 or Her3.The invasive ability of HBC9 was compared with that of four breast ductal carcinoma cell lines by Matrigel invasion assay. EGF stimulation induced the formation of surface protrusions and cell migration in HBC9 cells, and significantly increased the number of cells migrating through the Matrigel. The invasive ability of HBC9 was compared with other cell lines of breast carcinoma; it was much greater than that of MCF-7, BT474, or HBC5, but did not differ significantly from that of MDA-MB-231. Observation of the surface protrusions of HBC9 by confocal laser microscopy revealed co-localization of Arp2 and N-WASP with actin polymerization, detected by visualization with phalloidin, indicating that the protrusions induced by EGF were invadopodia. In HBC9 cells, cortactin also co-localized with the N-WASP/Arp2/3 complex in the protrusions. Immunohistochemistry of 12 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the breast revealed expression of cortactin and EGFR in all of them, and this was confirmed by western blotting in two cases.

Hybridisation analysis of DNA from 101 fresh human malignant tumours showed that the c-erbB-2 gene was amplified in 5 of 63 adenocarcinomas and none of 38 other types of tumours, whereas the c-erbB-1/EGF-receptor gene was amplified only in 1 of 8 squamous-cell carcinomas. Thus, the protein products of the amplified c-erbB-2 gene may have a role in the evolution of adenocarcinomas, as does the EGF receptor in some squamous-cell carcinomas.",

The study sample comprised of 27 patients with carcinoma of the tongue who underwent partial glossectomy and neck dissection between 1990 and 1999. Average follow-up was 54 months. Specimens from 23 patients were analyzed for growth factor expression using monoclonal antibodies specific for EGFR and Cerb-B2. Findings were correlated with the clinical course.

Despite the success in diagnosis and therapy during the past 30 years, oral squamous cell carcinoma still belongs to the tumor types with a very unfavorable prognosis. In an effort to identify genomic alterations with prognostic relevance, we applied the comparative genomic hybridization technique on oral squamous cell carcinoma. The tumors exhibited from five up to 47 DNA copy number alterations, indicating a considerable degree of genomic imbalance. Out of 35 tumors, 19 showed a gain of chromosome band 7p12. Genomic imbalances were investigated by hierarchical cluster analysis and clustered image mapping to investigate whether genomic profiles correlate with clinical data. Results of the present investigation show that profiling of genomic imbalances in general, and especially of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on 7p12, may be suitable as prognostic factors. In order to identify small-molecule inhibitors for EGFR, we established a database of 531 natural compounds derived from medicinal plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. Candidate compounds were identified by correlation analysis using the Kendall tau-test of IC50 values of tumor cell lines and microarray-based EGFR mRNA expression. Further validation was performed by molecular docking studies using the AutoDock program with the crystal structure of EGFR tyrosine kinase domain as docking template. We estimate these results will be a further step toward the ultimate goal of individualized, patient-adapted tumor treatment based on tumor molecular profiling.",

In sections from 9 of the patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, normal differentiated epithelia were included. Sections from 6 of these patients, in addition, contained dysplastic epithelia. Expression of EGF receptor-like material was demonstrated in the basal cell layer of normally differentiated laryngeal epithelial and in dysplastic epithelia. Fourteen of the squamous cell carcinomas proved EGF receptor positive. Nearly all cells in the poorly differentiated carcinomas showed positive staining with the antibodies. In moderately to well differentiated carcinomas a reduction in the extent of staining was seen in certain areas. Especially for the epithelial pearls, the staining reaction was localized to the undifferentiated cells in the periphery. This finding corresponds to the staining pattern observed in the basal cell layers of normal epithelial.

We have previously shown that one of the two intestinal epithelial desmosomal cadherins, desmocollin-2 (Dsc2) loss promotes colonic epithelial carcinoma cell proliferation and tumor formation. In this study we show that loss of the other intestinal desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein-2 (Dsg2) that pairs with Dsc2, results in decreased epithelial cell proliferation and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in mice. Dsg2-deficient cells demonstrated a compensatory increase in Dsc2 expression, and small interfering RNA-mediated loss of Dsc2 restored proliferation in Dsg2-deficient cells. Dsg2 downregulation inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and cell proliferation through altered phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in parallel with inhibited EGFR receptor internalization. Additionally, we demonstrated a central role of Dsc2 in controlling EGFR signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells. Consistent with these findings, analyses of human colon cancers demonstrated increased Dsg2 protein expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that partner desmosomal cadherins Dsg2 and Dsc2 play opposing roles in controlling colonic carcinoma cell proliferation through differential effects on EGFR signaling.

Second, cell blocks should be analysed rather than smear preparations and, third, specimens should be sent to external molecular laboratories within three working days of receiving requests. This study monitored how these recommendations are met in practice.;Our laboratory received 596 requests from cytologists from 13 different institutions. For each case, the cytological diagnosis, cytopreparation type, and time between the request and sample mailing were compared with the recommendations.;Of the 596 samples, 32 (5.4%) had been reported as SqCC. Three of these (9.4%) showed EGFR mutation. Cytological slides, either ThinPrep(™) (51.2%) or direct smears (43.2%), were more frequently received than cell blocks (5.7%). The mean time between the oncologist's request and specimen dispatching was 5.8 working days.;The occurrence of mutations in samples reported as SqCC was higher than expected. This questions the reliability of the original diagnosis, which reinforced the recommendation to evaluate the opportunity for testing non-adenocarcinoma cytology on a case-by-case basis. In spite of CAP/IASLC/AMP recommendations, cell blocks were underutilized for EGFR testing, but cytological slides were suitable for DNA analyses. Significant efforts are needed to avoid delays in outsourcing cytological samples for EGFR testing.",

A431, a human squamous carcinoma cell line that overexpresses EGFR mRNA, and mature skeletal muscle, known to express EGFR, served as control tissues. A biotinylated poly-T oligonucleotide probe was used to evaluate the preservation of mRNA in the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The EGFR mRNA and poly-T oligonucleotide probes were constructed with a target-specific, 5' region and a 3' non-hybridizing, biotinylated tail. Random sequence oligomers nine bases long added to the probe cocktail eliminated the need for formamide and sheared carrier DNA in the method. The assay produced strong, specific staining for EGFR mRNA in all cases of TCC and SCC, and in the A431 tumors, but not in skeletal muscle. The assay was completed in approximately 90 minutes.

We therefore assessed oral salivary gland neoplasms to identify associations between HPV and infection-related epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A/p16) and tumour protein p53 (TP53).

We demonstrated that salivary gland tumours are not associated with HPV infection. The expression of EGFR, CDKN2A and TP53 may be associated with tumour pathology but is not induced by HPV.

EGFR over-expression is frequently associated with gene mutation or amplification, thereby constituting a major target for molecular therapies. Recently, a new generation of EGFR inhibitors has been developed with pan-HER properties and irreversible actions. Allitinib® (AST1306) is an orally active, highly selective irreversible inhibitor of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases with promising efficacies. In the present study we aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of allitinib in a large panel of human cancer-derived cell lines and to correlate its efficacy to the mutational status of the EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA and PTEN genes. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the functional role of KRAS mutations in the response to this new inhibitor.;In total 76 different cancer-derived cell lines, representing 11 distinct histological types, were analyzed and classified into three groups: highly sensitive (HS), moderately sensitive (MS) and resistant (R). We found that 28 (36.8 %) cancer-derived cell lines exhibited a HS phenotype, 19 (25.0 %) a MS phenotype and 29 (38.1 %) a R phenotype. Allitinib showed a stronger cytotoxicity in head and neck, esophageal, melanoma and lung cancer-derived cell lines. We found that KRAS mutations were significantly associated with the R phenotype. To substantiate these results, an allitinib-sensitive lung cancer-derived cell line (H292) was transfected with plasmids carrying the two most common activating KRAS mutations (p.G12D and p.G12S). We found that both mutations reverted the allitinib-sensitive phenotype in these cells.;The current study represents the largest in vitro assessment of allitinib cytotoxicity performed to date. Through this study, we identified cancer types that could potentially benefit from this drug. Additionally, our findings suggest that prevalent KRAS mutations constitute potential predictive biomarkers for allitinib response.",

In HER2-overexpressing BT-474 breast cancer cells, we studied the effects of ZD1839 on cell growth and heterodimerization of receptors under basal and ligand-stimulated conditions.;ZD1839 was an equally potent inhibitor of growth in breast cancer cells expressing high levels of EGFR and HER2. In BT-474 breast cancer cells, ZD1839 abolished EGF- and heregulin-induced activation of ErbB receptors and downstream signaling molecules. Because ZD1839 does not inhibit the HER2 tyrosine kinase in vitro, and because heregulin is a ligand that activates HER2 by binding to HER3 and HER4 but does not bind to the EGFR, our findings suggested that ZD1839 interfered with HER2 function in intact cells. Searching for mechanisms, we report that ZD1839 induces the formation of inactive unphosphorylated EGFR/HER2 and EGFR/HER3 heterodimers. Furthermore, ZD1839 completely abolishes basal and heregulin-induced formation of active phosphorylated HER2/HER3 heterodimers.;ZD1839 inhibits the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, possibly by sequestration of HER2 and HER3 receptors in an inactive heterodimer configuration with the EGFR.

Pancreatic cancer is usually unresectable at the time of diagnosis because of metastasis or local extension. Despite the aggressive nature of this deadly disease, systemic treatment options are limited. Even the recent introduction of the deoxycytidine analogue gemcitabine does not extend median survival of responders beyond a year. Clearly, alternative, more effective regimens are needed for treating pancreatic carcinoma. In pancreatic cancer, there is overexpression of growth factors and growth factor receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Targeted toxins consist of a targeting polypeptide covalently linked to a peptide toxin. DAB(389)EGF is a fusion protein composed of the catalytic and translocation domains of diphtheria toxin fused via a His-Ala linker to human epidermal growth factor (EGF). The authors have previously shown that DAB(389)EGF is selectively toxic to EGFR-overexpressing cells, including human brain tumour and lung carcinoma cell lines. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma should be responsive to this fusion protein based on its EGFR overexpression. However, the cytotoxic effect of DAB(389)EGF on human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines has yet to be explored. The authors describe preliminary data showing the potent cytotoxicity of DAB(389)EGF to human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Because of the nonspecific toxicity to liver and kidney (which possess EGFR) of systemic administration, they also propose a potential novel drug delivery system for direct toxin implantation into pancreatic tumours using endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle injection (EUS-FNI). Hopefully, the use of these targeted therapeutic approaches in combination with other modalities may further extend survival and quality of life in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",

Afatinib is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naïve adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations in the EU, and for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations as detected by a US FDA-approved test in the US. In two randomized, open-label, multinational phase III trials, progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with afatinib compared with pemetrexed plus cisplatin (LUX-Lung 3) or gemcitabine plus cisplatin (LUX-Lung 6) in treatment-naïve patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. The objective response rate was significantly higher with afatinib than with pemetrexed plus cisplatin or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, and patient-reported outcomes for symptoms such as cough and dyspnoea and certain health-related quality of life measures significantly favoured afatinib versus pemetrexed plus cisplatin or gemcitabine plus cisplatin. Afatinib also showed efficacy in EGFR TKI-naïve patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and activating EGFR mutations who had received no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease, according to the results of the noncomparative, multinational, phase II LUX-Lung 2 trial. Oral afatinib had a manageable tolerability profile. EGFR-mediated adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea, rash/acne) were generally managed using dose reduction and delays.

The positive rate of EGFR, p-EGFR, and HER2 was 97.2%, 44.4%, and 88.6%, respectively, and the overexpression rate was 80.6%, 0.0%, and 27.8%, respectively. EGFR overexpression and phosphorylation were seen at almost the same rate in each histological type of squamous and nonsquamous cell carcinoma (squamous vs. nonsquamous; 78.6% vs. 81.8% for EGFR, 35.7% vs. 50.0% for p-EGFR), while HER2 overexpression was seen less frequently in squamous cell carcinoma than in nonsquamous cell carcinoma (0.0% vs. 45.5%, P = 0.003). Univariate analysis revealed that EGFR overexpression was related to good performance status (P = 0.038) but not related to EGFR phosphorylation. EGFR phosphorylation was correlated to short time to progression (TTP) (P = 0.002) and poor prognosis (P = 0.002), although EGFR overexpression, HER2 overexpression, or EGFR-HER2 coexpression were not correlated to TTP or survival. Bivariate analysis showed EGFR phosphorylation was related to short TTP and poor prognosis both in early and advanced stages. Multivariate analyses confirmed that clinical stage, performance status, and p-EGFR expression were independently associated with increasing risk of short TTP and poor prognosis. These results suggest that phosphorylation, but not overexpression, of EGFR may be an important predictor for clinical outcome of NSCLCs.",

Amphiregulin (AREG) was the only EGFR ligand that could be consistently detected in conditioned media from the SCC lines, and reduction of its expression either by siRNA or by precipitating antibody reduced PTHrP mRNA expression as effectively as EGFR-targeted inhibition. Using siRNA knockdown or inhibitors to upstream regulators of AREG shedding including TACE, Src/Lck, and G(i/o), also reduced PTHrP mRNA expression. We determined that blockade of autocrine AREG-EGFR signaling does not affect PTHrP mRNA stability. Of the three PTHrP promoters (P1, P2, and P3), P1 mRNA could be reduced by nearly 100% with an EGFR inhibitor, and both epidermal growth factor and AREG stimulated P1 mRNA by approximately 5-fold. Finally, ectopic expression of EGFR in a receptor-low but AREG-expressing cell line increased PTHrP mRNA levels in vitro, and induced the capability to cause HHM and rapid osteolytic growth in vivo. Taken together, we provide evidence that AREG stimulation of EGFR results in high levels of PTHrP gene expression, contributing to cancer-associated bone pathology.",

Here, we demonstrate in oestrogen receptor-positive and -negative human breast cancer cells and primary mammary epithelial cells a cross-communication between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the EGFR. We present evidence that specific inhibition of ADAM15 or TACE blocks GPCR-induced and proHB-EGF-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, downstream mitogenic signalling and cell migration. Notably, activation of the PI3K downstream mediator PKB/Akt by GPCR ligands involves the activity of sphingosine kinase (SPHK) and is independent of EGFR signal transactivation.

Our particular emphasis in this review will be on how ErbB receptors, in particular ErbB1 and ErbB2, contribute to processes linked to cancer progression.

One representative cascade is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.;The authors investigated the involvement of mTOR in the pathobiologic profiles of 150 specimens of lung carcinoma by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting in correlation with the upstream and downstream proteins Akt and p70S6-kinase (S6K), respectively.;Immunohistochemistry revealed Akt activation in 44% of tumors and mTOR expression in 68.7% of tumors, and the preponderance of activation was observed in adenocarcinoma (AC) (100%). Phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) was observed in 53.3% of tumors and had the highest frequency in AC (89.7%). In AC, the frequency of p-mTOR staining was higher in the well differentiated subtype, in particular, in the acinar structure. However, little correlation was observed between the activation of mTOR and Akt, except in the 5 AC specimens that harbored an EGFR gene mutation, which exhibited constitutive activation of both Akt and mTOR. Conversely, in squamous cell carcinomas, mTOR activation was associated with a significantly higher frequency of lymph node metastasis.;The results of this study suggested the dual functions of mTOR. First, mTOR may function not only in the proliferation of tumor cells as an effector molecule downstream of EGFR but also possibly in the morphogenesis of AC. Second, the activation of mTOR may play a key role in metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma. Overall, the current results demonstrated the potential for the application of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, as an additional novel component of chemotherapy for a defined subset of patients with lung carcinoma.",

In animal models, ultraviolet-B is a complete carcinogen, capable of inducing and promoting the development of malignant cells. A key element of ultraviolet-B-induced carcinogenesis is the ability of ultraviolet-B to induce the expression of a number of cellular proteins and activate growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, including the erbB receptor family. Keratinocytes express the erbB1 (also called EGF-R, HER1), the erbB2 (also known as neu or HER2), and the erbB3 (HER3) subtypes. In general, activation of the erbB receptor family leads to a cellular proliferative response. In certain instances, however, activation of an erbB receptor can induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and even apoptosis. The inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity in rodent models and human skin has been shown to inhibit some ultraviolet-B response pathways. We have shown that the inhibition of erbB receptors, by both pharmaceutical and immunologic means, will inhibit ultraviolet-B-induced apoptosis in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. This inhibition was specific for the erbB receptor family and specific for ultraviolet-B-induced apoptosis.

In these tumor cells in culture, epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation initiates signaling via persistent activation of selective STAT proteins. To determine the timing of Stat3 activation in head and neck carcinogenesis, we studied the expression and constitutive activation of Stat3 in tumors and normal mucosa from patients with head and neck cancer compared with mucosa from controls without cancer. Stat3 was up-regulated and constitutively activated in both primary human head and neck tumors as well as in normal mucosa from these cancer patients compared with control normal mucosa from patients without cancer. In vivo liposome-mediated gene therapy with a Stat3 antisense plasmid efficiently inhibited Stat3 activation, increased tumor cell apoptosis, and decreased Bcl-x(L) expression in a head and neck xenograft model. These findings provide evidence that constitutively activated Stat3 is an early event in head and neck carcinogenesis that contributes to the loss of growth control by an anti-apoptotic mechanism.",

There is only limited knowledge if and how EGFR signalling pathways are important for invasion-associated processes and for the regulation of Ln-5/gamma2. Therefore the distribution of phosphorylated Erk1/2, p38 MAPK and Akt was immunohistochemically defined in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of different histological grade and compared to histological criteria of invasion and cytoplasmic Ln-5/gamma2 deposition. With raising histological grade, there is a slight increase in nuclear pErk1/2-stained tumour cells (P=0.398) and a loss of nuclear (P=0.593) and increased cytoplasmic staining (P=0.144) of pAkt mainly in invading OSCC cells. Nuclear pp38 MAPK could only be sporadically detected in few cases. In case of pErk1/2 and pAkt, only a partial co-localisation could be revealed in cases with abundant kinases and Ln-5/gamma2. Among the investigated kinases, only pAkt shows a relation to histological grade and invasion in OSCC. pErk1/2, pp38 MAPK and pAkt do not represent a direct link between EGFR and Ln-5 synthesis.

As we showed prolactinoma HER2 overexpression, we generated constitutively active HER2-stable GH3 cell transfectants (HER2CA). PRL mRNA levels were induced approximately 250-fold and PRL secretion was enhanced 100-fold in HER2CA cells, which also exhibited increased proliferation. Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ErbB1 and HER2, blocked receptor signaling, and suppressed PRL expression more than gefitinib, a TKI of EGFR/ErbB1. Lapatinib also suppressed colony formation in soft agar more than gefitinib. Oral lapatinib treatment caused tumor shrinkage and serum PRL suppression both in HER2CA transfectant-inoculated Wistar-Furth rats and in estrogen-induced Fischer344 rat prolactinomas. In cultured human cells derived from resected prolactinoma tissue, lapatinib suppressed both PRL mRNA expression and secretion.

Basal cell carcinoma rarely metastasizes but commonly causes significant local tissue destruction and disfigurement, whereas squamous cell carcinoma is associated with a substantial risk of recurrence and metastasis; the prognosis in metastatic patients is poor. Surgical approaches give a cure rate greater than 90% if appropriately applied, on the basis of the characteristics of the primary tumors and of the patients, but in selected cases, medical treatment (5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, diclofenac and, more recently, ingenol mebutate) is preferable to invasive procedures and provides a good chance of cure, with generally excellent cosmetic outcomes. In case of advanced and metastatic non-melanoma skin cancer, newly developed molecularly targeted therapy represents a reasonably promising alternative to classical cytostatics. In particular, the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, is effective and well-tolerated in squamous cell carcinoma patients. Moreover, the recent identification of mutations in the Hedgehog signaling pathway in basal cell carcinoma lead to the development of the smoothened Hedgehog pathway inhibitor vismodegib, that was recently approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma.

ZNF216 gene has been identified as one of Immediate Early Genes (IEGs) induced by RTKs. Overexpression of ZNF216 protein sensitizes 293 cell line to TNF-α induced apoptosis. However, ZNF216 overexpression has been reported in medulloblastomas and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Thus, the role of this protein is still not clearly understood. In this study, the inverse correlation between EGFR and ZNF216 expression was confirmed in various human cancer cell lines differently expressing EGFR. EGF treatment of NIH3T3 cells overexpressing both EGFR and ZNF216 (NIH3T3-EGFR/ZNF216), induced a long lasting activation of EGFR in the cytosolic fraction and an accumulation of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) more in the nuclear than in the cytosolic fraction compared to NIH3T3-EGFR cells. Moreover, EGF was able to stimulate an increased expression of ZNF216 in the cytosolic compartment and its nuclear translocation in a time-dependent manner in NIH3T3-EGFR/ZNF216. A similar trend was observed in A431 cells endogenously expressing the EGFR and transfected with Znf216. The increased levels of pEGFR and ZNF216 in the nuclear fraction of NIH3T3-EGFR/ZNF216 cells were paralleled by increased levels of phospho-MAPK and phospho-Akt. Surprisingly, EGF treatment of NIH3T3-EGFR/ZNF216 cells induced a significant increase of apoptosis thus indicating that ZNF216 could sensitize cells to EGF-induced apoptosis and suggesting that it may be involved in the regulation and effects of EGFR signaling.",

Extranodal spread to cervical lymph nodes is the most significant prognostic indicator in OSCC. In the present study, we investigated the clinical significance of single versus paired overexpression of members of the ErbB receptor family in 82 OSCC patients with lymph nodes metastasis, with or without capsular rupture (CR) followed by at least 10 years. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a common overexpression of ErbB1 (P = 0.021), ErbB2 (P = 0.001), ErbB4 (P = 0.048), as well as MMP-2 (P = 0.043) in OSCC cases with CR+. Increased expression of ErbB1 was associated with MMP-2 in tumors with advanced clinical stages, including poorly differentiated (grade III) tumors (P < 0.050). Vascular embolization was associated with MMP-2 (P = 0.021) and MMP-13 (P = 0.010) overexpression. Survival analysis revealed a lower survival probability in tumors overexpressing ErbB1 (P = 0.038), ErbB4 (P = 0.043), and MMP-12 (P = 0.050). As well a strong association was observed in cases with high risk of recurrence and strong immunostaining for ErbB1 (P = 0.017), ErbB4 (P = 0.008), MMP-1 (P = 0.003), MMP-2 (P = 0.016), MMP-10 (P = 0.041), and MMP-13 (P = 0.005). Stratified multivariate survival analysis revealed a strong prognostic interdependence of ErbB1 and ErbB4 cooverexpression in predicting the worst overall and disease-free survivals (P = 0.0013 and P = 0.0004, respectively). Taken together, these results support a cooperation of ErbB1, ErbB4, and members of the MMP family in predicting OSCC invasion and poor clinical outcomes.",

Results of phase II clinical trials of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown that these compounds have little activity in breast cancer patients when used as single agents. The potential pitfalls of these clinical trials, and the molecular mechanisms that might be involved in regulating the sensitivity/resistance of breast cancer cells to EGFR TKIs are discussed in this brief article. In particular, preclinical findings clearly demonstrate that breast cancer cells are able to activate different mechanisms to escape the anti-tumor effects of drugs directed against growth factor-driven pathways. Therefore, it is conceivable that significant blockade of tumor growth might be obtained only through contemporary blockade of different growth promoting pathways, at least in advanced disease. In addition, preclinical and clinical findings support the use of EGFR TKIs in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, such as estrogen receptor positive (ER+), tamoxifen resistant patients. In this regard, we describe potential future applications of these compounds in combination with other agents in the treatment of breast carcinoma.",

As the EGFR directed antibody cetuximab has shown activity concurrent with radiotherapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, as well as in stage IV NSCLC combined with chemotherapy, we wanted to investigate radiotherapy with concurrent cetuximab in locally advanced NSCLC, a tumour type often over expressing the EGF-receptor.;Between February 2006 and August 2007 75 patients in stage III NSCLC with good performance status (PS 0 or 1) and adequate lung function (FEV1>1.0) were enrolled in this phase II study at eight institutions. Treatment consisted of 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy, docetaxel 75 mg/m² and cisplatin 75 mg/m² with 3 weeks interval. An initial dose of cetuximab 400 mg/m² was given before start of 3D-CRT to 68 Gy with 2 Gy per fraction in 7 weeks concurrent with weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m². TOXICITY was scored weekly during radiotherapy (CTC 3.0), and after treatment the patients were followed every third month with CT-scans, toxicity scoring and QLQ.;Seventy-one patients were eligible for analysis as four were incorrectly enrolled.;adenocarcinoma 49%, squamous cell carcinoma 39% and other NSCLC 12%. The majority had PS 0 (62.5%), median age 62.2 (42-81), 50% were women and 37% had a pre-treatment weight loss>5%.;esophagitis grade 1-2: 72%; grade 3: 1.4%.

To determine the relationship between the G/G and G/A genotypes, we assessed the EGFR gene copy number and the EGFR mRNA half-life in 16 different SCCHN cell lines. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the EGFR copy number was significantly higher in the nine 2607G/A cell lines than in the seven 2607G/G cell lines (3.59±2.14 vs. 1.58±0.32 copies, a 2.27-fold difference). Similarly, the half life of EGFR mRNA was 2.24-fold higher in cell lines with the 2607G/A genotype than in those with wild-type. By contrast, the EGFR protein levels were inversely correlated with mRNA abundance.

Further investigation demonstrated that ErbB receptors distribute differentially in hippocampal neurons with the epidermal growth factor receptor confined to neural cell bodies and the p185(c-neu) and ErbB4 receptors distributed to both neural soma and neurites. Activation of ErbB receptor and downstream signaling molecules were observed in neurites only after heregulin stimulation. The receptor complex which mediated neurite located signals was the p185(c-neu)/ErbB4 heterodimer. Colocalization of p185(c-neu), but not epidermal growth factor receptor, with postsynaptic density protein 95 suggests that the heregulin signaling contributes to synapse specific activities. However, the epidermal growth factor receptor complex mediates physiological survival signals, as neuronal survival was enhanced by epidermal growth factor, rather than heregulin. Collectively, these studies indicate that different ErbB ensembles localize to different locations on the neuron to mediate distinct signals and functions.",

The objective of this study was to analyze whether epidermal growth factor receptor expression predicts tumor response and sphincter preserving in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation therapy.;This study was conducted on 34 patients with locally-advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who were treated with preoperative chemoradiation therapy. The patients had histologically-proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum with the inferior margin of the tumor located no farther than 6 cm from the anal verge. Preoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the pelvis with 60CO to 50.4 Gy. All patients received simultaneous chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, 300 mg/m(2) IV infused over 24 hr during radiotherapy on days 1 - 5 every week; 28 patients received oxaliplatin 50 - 60 mg/m(2) weekly during radiotherapy. The patients were restaged by physical examination and pelvic CT, between four and six weeks later. Then, they were referred to a surgeon who was expert in gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Subsequently, postsurgical specimen was histopathologically examined and graded according to the Mandard criteria for assessment of pathologic response after neo-adjuvant chemoradiation. Immunohistochemistry for epidermal growth factor receptor was determined at the preradiation biopsy and was evaluated according to the extension and staining intensity.;Fourteen (41%) out of 34 tumors were epidermal growth factor receptor positive. Twenty (59%) patients responded to pelvic preoperative chemoradiation. Sixteen (47%) patients achieved complete response with no residual tumor in the resected specimen; four (12%) were downstaged (partial response). Response to pelvic radiotherapy was observed in 80% of those negative for epidermal growth factor receptor and in 28% of those with positive epidermal growth factor receptor (P = 0.005). Only two of 14 positive epidermal growth factor receptor patients achieved a complete response, while 14 of 20 of the negative epidermal growth factor receptor patients developed complete response.

Frequent molecular genetic abnormalities occur in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but little is known about which of these precede an invasive carcinoma. We examined the expression of p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and transforming growth factor alpha, the most common molecular genetic abnormalities in NSCLC, in preneoplastic bronchial lesions. Primary NSCLC and associated bronchial lesions were identified by retrospective review of resected tumors at this center. Expression in the invasive carcinomas, the associated bronchial lesions, and normal lung were contrasted using immunohistochemistry. Thirty-four NSCLC associated with 62 bronchial lesions were identified. The invasive tumors included 15 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 19 non-SCCs. Bronchial lesions included areas of squamous metaplasia (n = 14), inflammatory atypia (n = 19), dysplasia (n = 17), and carcinoma in situ (n = 12). Nineteen (56%) NSCLC and 10 (16%) bronchial lesions exhibited aberrant p53 immunostaining, whereas 18 (53%) NSCLC and 30 (48%) bronchial lesions showed abnormal EGFR immunostaining. Positive staining for transforming growth factor alpha was seen in 16 (47%) NSCLC but occurred inconsistently in the bronchial lesions and in normal bronchial epithelium. Only bronchial lesions associated with squamous cell carcinomas exhibited staining for p53. Aberrant EGFR expression was not associated with a specific type of invasive carcinoma or with specific preneoplastic lesions, although there was a trend toward increased expression in dysplasia and carcinoma in situ relative to metaplasia and atypia. All but one of the NSCLC simultaneously showing aberrant p53 and EGFR staining were SCC. We conclude that: (a) transforming growth factor alpha is variably expressed in normal respiratory epithelium as well as reactive and preneoplastic bronchial lesions; (b) p53 expression is seen in preneoplastic bronchial lesions but is not present in reactive or metaplastic epithelium; (c) aberrant EGFR expression occurs in both reactive and preinvasive bronchial lesions and may be an early marker of neoplastic transformation; and (d) the simultaneous aberrant expression of EGFR and p53 occurs predominantly in SCC and their associated bronchial lesions. These findings indicate that aberrant expression of p53 or the EGFR is frequent in bronchial neoplasia, and coexpression may predispose to the development of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.",

In order to identify mechanisms through which these receptor tyrosine kinases accelerate tumor progression, the regulation of metalloprotease expression by EGFR family members was investigated in 11 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines. HER2 expression was significantly correlated with ADAM12 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 12) expression in these cell lines and was co-expressed in human head and neck cancers. Inhibition of HER2 or EGFR decreased ADAM12 transcripts whereas HER2 transfection upregulated ADAM12 expression. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HER2 regulation of ADAM12, we investigated the signaling pathways directing ADAM12 production in SCC cells. Inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase or mammalian target of rapamycin decreased ADAM12 transcripts in HER2-expressing SCC cells, whereas transfection with AKT increased ADAM12 mRNA. Experiments utilizing ADAM12 transfection or siRNA targeting of ADAM12 revealed that the protease increased both the migration and invasiveness of oral SCC cells. Surprisingly, ADAM12 also increased HER2 message, protein levels and activity through an Ets1-dependent mechanism. Collectively, these results reveal a novel positive activation loop between ADAM12 and HER2 that may contribute to HNSCC progression.",

Cobalt chloride increases Akt phosphorylation in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. Blocking the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway using LY294002 abolished Akt activation in response to cobalt chloride, suggesting that Akt phosphorylation by cobalt chloride is dependent on PI3K. In addition, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway seems to rely on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), since the inhibition of EGFR attenuated cobalt chloride-induced Akt activation.

Effects of GALNT2 overexpression and knockdown on cell migration and invasion were analyzed in SAS cells by transwell migration assay and matrigel invasion assay, respectively. The Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA) pull down assay was conducted to detect changes in O-glycans on acceptor substrates of GALNT2. Cell signaling was analyzed by Western blotting.;GALNT2 was overexpressed in 73% (35/48) of OSCC tissues. Moreover, GALNT2 expression was localized in the invasive front and increased in high grade OSCC. GALNT2 overexpression enhanced migration and invasion of SAS cells triggered by fetal bovine serum (FBS) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). In contrast, GALNT2 knockdown inhibited SAS cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, GALNT2 overexpression enhanced VVA binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT. Conversely, GALNT2 knockdown decreased VVA binding and suppressed activity of EGFR and AKT.;GALNT2 is frequently overexpressed in OSCC, especially in the carcinoma cells at the invasive front. GALNT2 overexpression enhances the invasive potential of OSCC cells via modifying O-glycosylation and activity of EGFR.

To address advances in oncology, molecular biology, pathology, radiology, and surgery of lung adenocarcinoma, an international multidisciplinary classification was sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society. This new adenocarcinoma classification is needed to provide uniform terminology and diagnostic criteria, especially for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), the overall approach to small nonresection cancer specimens, and for multidisciplinary strategic management of tissue for molecular and immunohistochemical studies.;An international core panel of experts representing all three societies was formed with oncologists/pulmonologists, pathologists, radiologists, molecular biologists, and thoracic surgeons. A systematic review was performed under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society Documents Development and Implementation Committee. The search strategy identified 11,368 citations of which 312 articles met specified eligibility criteria and were retrieved for full text review. A series of meetings were held to discuss the development of the new classification, to develop the recommendations, and to write the current document. Recommendations for key questions were graded by strength and quality of the evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.;The classification addresses both resection specimens, and small biopsies and cytology. The terms BAC and mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer used. For resection specimens, new concepts are introduced such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) for small solitary adenocarcinomas with either pure lepidic growth (AIS) or predominant lepidic growth with ≤ 5 mm invasion (MIA) to define patients who, if they undergo complete resection, will have 100% or near 100% disease-specific survival, respectively. AIS and MIA are usually nonmucinous but rarely may be mucinous. Invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern after using comprehensive histologic subtyping with lepidic (formerly most mixed subtype tumors with nonmucinous BAC), acinar, papillary, and solid patterns; micropapillary is added as a new histologic subtype. Variants include invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous BAC), colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma. This classification provides guidance for small biopsies and cytology specimens, as approximately 70% of lung cancers are diagnosed in such samples. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), in patients with advanced-stage disease, are to be classified into more specific types such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, whenever possible for several reasons: (1) adenocarcinoma or NSCLC not otherwise specified should be tested for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as the presence of these mutations is predictive of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, (2) adenocarcinoma histology is a strong predictor for improved outcome with pemetrexed therapy compared with squamous cell carcinoma, and (3) potential life-threatening hemorrhage may occur in patients with squamous cell carcinoma who receive bevacizumab. If the tumor cannot be classified based on light microscopy alone, special studies such as immunohistochemistry and/or mucin stains should be applied to classify the tumor further. Use of the term NSCLC not otherwise specified should be minimized.;This new classification strategy is based on a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma that incorporates clinical, molecular, radiologic, and surgical issues, but it is primarily based on histology. This classification is intended to support clinical practice, and research investigation and clinical trials. As EGFR mutation is a validated predictive marker for response and progression-free survival with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, we recommend that patients with advanced adenocarcinomas be tested for EGFR mutation. This has implications for strategic management of tissue, particularly for small biopsies and cytology samples, to maximize high-quality tissue available for molecular studies. Potential impact for tumor, node, and metastasis staging include adjustment of the size T factor according to only the invasive component (1) pathologically in invasive tumors with lepidic areas or (2) radiologically by measuring the solid component of part-solid nodules."},

This review focuses on the available clinical data on epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting drugs in the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer.;Three drugs are currently in phase 2 and phase 3 development as single agents or in combination with other anticancer therapies in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients: cetuximab (Erbitux), a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody that blocks ligand binding and functional epidermal growth factor receptor activation; and erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib (Iressa), two orally bioavailable, small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors of tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity that prevent epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylation and activation. Single-agent gefitinib treatment has determined a 10 to 20% response rate and a 30 to 50% symptom improvement in previously treated, chemotherapy-refractory advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer patients. Gefitinib has been the first epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting agent to be registered as an anticancer drug in several countries, including Japan, Australia, and the United States, for the third-line treatment of chemoresistant nonsmall cell lung cancer patients.;Antiepidermal growth factor receptor has shown promising antitumor activity in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients with a mild toxicity profile.

We used receptor TK (RTK) capture arrays to identify receptors active in NSCLC cell lines. As Met and ErbBs were active, we explored the potential therapeutic advantage of combined targeting of Met with ErbB receptor family inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC. We found that Met physically interacts with both EGFR and Her2 in a NSCLC cell line with overexpression/overactivation of Met. Combined use of a dual EGFR/Her2 inhibitor with a Met inhibitor yields maximal growth inhibition compared with the use of EGFR and/or Met inhibitors. This suggests that simultaneous inhibition of multiple RTKs may be needed to effectively abrogate tumour cell growth.

This antibody effectively blocks the binding of EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and HB-EGF to the EGFR, inhibits the growth in vitro of tumour cell lines which overexpress the EGFR and eradicates such tumours when grown as xenografts in athymic mice. Eleven patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and nine patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, whose tumours expressed EGFR, were recruited. Groups of three patients were treated with 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg of ICR62 and a further eight patients received 100 mg. All patients were evaluated for toxicity using WHO criteria. Patients' sera were tested for the clearance of MAb ICR62 and the development of human anti-rat antibodies (HARA). No serious (WHO Grade III-IV) toxicity was observed in patients treated with up to 100 mg of antibody ICR62. Antibody ICR62 could be detected at 4 h and 24 h in the sera of patients treated with 40 mg or 100 mg of ICR62. Only 4/20 patients showed HARA responses (one at 20 mg, one at 40 mg and two at 100 mg doses) and of these only the former two were anti-idiotypic responses. In four patients receiving doses of ICR62 at 40 mg or greater, biopsies were obtained from metastatic lesions 24 h later and examined for the localisation of ICR62 using anti-rat antibody reagent. In these patients we showed the localisation of MAb ICR62 to the membranes of tumour cells; this appeared to be more prominent at the higher dose of 100 mg. On the basis of these data we conclude that MAb ICR62 can be administered safely to patients with squamous cell carcinomas and that it can localise efficiently to metastases even at relatively low doses.",

Squamous tumors also erupted spontaneously on the skin of MT-HGF mice that were promoted by wounding or the application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C. Carcinogen-initiated tumors had Ras mutations, but spontaneous tumors did not. Cultured keratinocytes from MT-HGF mice and oncogenic RAS-transduced keratinocytes shared phenotypic and biochemical features of initiation that were dependent on autocrine activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through increased synthesis and release of EGFR ligands, which was mediated by the kinase SRC, the pseudoproteases iRhom1 and iRhom2, and the metallopeptidase ADAM17. Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR caused the regression of MT-HGF squamous tumors that developed spontaneously in orthografts of MT-HGF keratinocytes combined with dermal fibroblasts and implanted onto syngeneic mice. The global gene expression profile in MET-transformed keratinocytes was highly concordant with that in RAS-transformed keratinocytes, and a core RAS/MET coexpression network was activated in precancerous and cancerous human skin lesions. Tissue arrays revealed that many human skin SCCs have abundant HGF at both the transcript and protein levels. Thus, through the activation of EGFR, MET activation parallels a RAS pathway to contribute to human and mouse cutaneous cancers. ",

Among the high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ cases, a triple-positive profile (positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2) and cytokeratin 5/6 expression by neoplastic cells were negatively associated with invasion. In the low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ subgroup, only cytokeratin 5/6 expression exhibited a negative association with the probability of invasion.;The immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 5/6 by ductal carcinoma in situ epithelial cells may provide clinically useful information regarding the risk of progression to invasive disease.",

We have discussed the scientific findings and the impact on practice guidelines and ongoing clinical trials. The report on KRAS status in patients with metastatic CRC receiving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted antibody treatment has led to a change in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline that recommends only patients with wild-type KRAS tumor should receive this treatment. The results of double biologics (bevacizumab and anti-EGFR antibody) plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic CRC has shown a worse outcome than bevacizumab-based regimen. Microsatellite Instability has again been confirmed to be an important predictor in patients with stage II colon cancer receiving adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant gemcitabine therapy for pancreatic cancer was investigated by the CONKO-001 study; this resulted in superior survival as compared with observation and can be regarded as an acceptable option, without the addition of radiotherapy. The addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine and erlotinib was not supior to gemcitabine and erlotinib for advanced disease. Second-line therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin resulted in a survival benefit. Irinotecan plus cisplatin and paclitaxel plus cisplatin result in similar survival when combined with radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. The novel fluoropyrimidine S1 appears to be active in gastric cancer, as a single agent or as combination therapy. Adjuvant intraperitoneal mitomycin-C may decrease the incidence of peritoneal recurrence of gastric cancer. Sorafenib is an effective agent in Asian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to hepatitis B; its utility in child's B cirrhosis remains to be proven. Sunitinib is also an active agent in hepatocellular carcinoma, and may represent an alterative to sorafenib for advanced disease.

Here, we studied two such combi-molecules (JDD36 and JDE05), containing a novel quinazoline-linked chloroethyltriazolinium system. The epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting potential of these novel structures was studied by ELISA for isolated epidermal growth factor receptor and by Western blotting for whole-cell assays. DNA damage was analyzed using the single-cell microelectrophoresis comet assay. Antiproliferative effects were determined by the sulforhodamine B assay. JDD36 showed an IC50 of 0.6 micromol/l in the ELISA for epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, a dose-dependent inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation and significant levels of DNA damage in the human DU145 prostate cancer cell line. JDD36 was an overall 2- to 15-fold stronger antiproliferative agent than JDE05 that showed potent epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitory activity (IC50 epidermal growth factor receptor, 0.035 micromol/l) but weak DNA-damaging potential. In a panel of LNCaP erbB transfectants, in contrast to JDE05, JDD36 showed remarkable and selective potency against the LNCaPerbB2 transfectant. The results in toto suggest that the overall superior potency of JDD36 when compared with JDE05 may be imputed to its balanced binary epidermal growth factor receptor-DNA-targeting properties that may induce a tandem blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated mitogenic signaling while depleting alternative survival mechanism by damaging DNA.",

Amplification and overexpression of the c-erbB-2/neu gene has been shown in certain human tumors and is postulated to be important in human carcinogenesis. High levels of expression of the c-erbB-2/neu gene have been reported in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and primary tumors from the United States. Since geographical and cultural factors may contribute to the development of certain types of cancer, we examined p185 examined p185 expression in 120 tumors from Chinese patients with lung cancers of different cell types and used immunohistochemical staining to determine the extent and general significance of p185 expression in human primary lung cancer. Our results demonstrate that 58.8% of the NSCLCs expressed p185 and that expression of p185 was observed only in NSCLC and not in small-cell lung cancers. Thirty-three of 41 adenocarcinomas and 24 of 55 squamous cell carcinomas among the NSCLCs examined were found to express p185 at levels different from those of normal lung. For the squamous cell carcinomas, p185 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P less than 0.01), but for the adenocarcinomas, it was not (P greater than 0.05). In addition, expression of p185 in NSCLC was significantly more frequent in patients in advanced clinical stages. Our findings indicate that p185 expression is a frequent event and a general phenomenon in NSCLC and is correlated with poor clinical prognostic indicators, suggesting that expression of p185 may be of potential prognostic importance in NSCLC.",

Although EGFR mutations are more frequent in non-squamous histology, the receptor itself is more often overexpressed in squamous NSCLC. Necitumumab is a human monoclonal antibody that is able to inhibit the EGFR pathway and cause antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. This drug has been studied in combination with first-line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC in two Phase III trials, and a significant survival benefit was reported in squamous NSCLC (SQUIRE trial); by contrast, necitumumab did not prove itself beneficial in non-squamous histotype (INSPIRE trial). On the basis of the SQUIRE results, necitumumab was approved in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for advanced squamous NSCLC, both in the US and Europe, where its availability is limited to patients with EGFR-expressing tumors. The aim of this review is to describe the tolerability and the efficacy of necitumumab by searching the available published data and define its potential role in the current landscape of NSCLC treatment.

Sixty-three percent of tumors were clinical Stage I lesions, and 37% were Stage II-III lesions. In a multivariate analysis that controlled for age, gender, and race, syndecan-1 expression was found to be associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.31 [95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.87]; P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis also indicated that EGFR expression was associated with a significant reduced risk of death.;The authors demonstrated that expression of either of the nonsmall cell lung carcinoma subtype classifiers syndecan-1 and EGFR was associated with a 30% reduction in the risk of death, with this reduction being independent of histology and other confounders. The results of the current study suggest that loss of expression of these histologic classifiers is associated with biologic aggressiveness in lung tumors and with poor outcome for patients with such tumors.

Affibody molecules against EGFR (Z(EGFR)) show excellent tumor localizations in imaging studies. However, one major drawback is that radiometal-labeled Affibody molecules display extremely high uptakes in the radiosensitive kidneys which may impact their use as radiotherapeutic agents. The purpose of this study is to further explore whether radiometal-labeled human serum albumin (HSA)-Z(EFGR) bioconjugates display desirable profiles for the use in radionuclide therapy of EGFR-positive head and neck carcinomas. The Z(EFGR) analog, Ac-Cys-Z(EGFR:1907), was site-specifically conjugated with HSA. The resulting bioconjugate 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (DO3A)-HSA-Z(EGFR:1907) was then radiolabeled with either (64)Cu or (177)Lu and subjected to in vitro cell uptake and internalization studies using the human oral squamous carcinoma cell line SAS. Positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and biodistribution studies were conducted using SAS-tumor-bearing mice. Cell studies revealed a high (8.43 ± 0.55 % at 4 h) and specific (0.95 ± 0.09 % at 4 h) uptake of (177)Lu-DO3A-HSA-Z(EGFR:1907) as determined by blocking with nonradioactive Z(EGFR:1907).

The most common EGFR gene mutations occur as either deletions in exon 19 or as substitution L858R in exon 21 and cause a clinically beneficial response to gefinitib or erlotinib treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of patients finally develop resistance to these drugs. Acquired resistance is linked to secondary mutations localised in the EGFR gene, mainly substitution T790M in exon 20. Through intense research a few different mechanisms of resistance to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been identified: amplification of MET or IGF-1R genes, abnormalities of PTEN and mTOR proteins as well as rare mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes. Extensively investigated new drugs could be of significant efficiency in NSCLC patients with secondary resistance to reversible EGFR TKI. ",

We therefore wanted to ascertain the relevance of this observation for human colon cancerogenesis. Utilizing in situ mRNA hybridization and immunocytochemical techniques, we analyzed cell-specific expression of VDR and EGFR in normal and malignant human colonic mucosa. In normal mucosa, VDR positivity is weak and observed only in a small number of luminal surface colonocytes. In contrast, EGFR expression at a relatively high level is also found in cells at the crypt base. The number of VDR-positive colonocytes increases remarkably during tumor progression. It reaches its maximum in low grade adenocarcinomas and returns to lower levels in highly malignant cancers. In both low- and high grade carcinomas, the great majority of tumor cells contain the EGFR message. The relative abundance of EGFR over VDR in normal mucosa and in high grade carcinomas would create a situation in which mitogenic effects from EGFR activation are only ineffectively counteracted by signaling from 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3/VDR. In contrast, in well to moderately differentiated tumors, upregulation of VDR could retard further tumor progression.",

Dramatic and durable responses have occurred in NSCLC tumors with mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In contrast, these inhibitors have shown limited efficacy in glioblastoma, where a distinct EGFR mutation, the variant III (vIII) in-frame deletion of exons 2-7, is commonly found. In this study, we determined that EGFRvIII mutation was present in 5% (3/56) of analyzed human lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but was not present in human lung adenocarcinoma (0/123). We analyzed the role of the EGFRvIII mutation in lung tumorigenesis and its response to tyrosine kinase inhibition. Tissue-specific expression of EGFRvIII in the murine lung led to the development of NSCLC. Most importantly, these lung tumors depend on EGFRvIII expression for maintenance. Treatment with an irreversible EGFR inhibitor, HKI-272, dramatically reduced the size of these EGFRvIII-driven murine tumors in 1 week. Similarly, Ba/F3 cells transformed with the EGFRvIII mutant were relatively resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib in vitro but proved sensitive to HKI-272. These findings suggest a therapeutic strategy for cancers harboring the EGFRvIII mutation.",

Epidermal growth factor receptor is a transmembrane receptor forming dimers on ligand binding.

The most clinically advanced EGFR inhibition strategies include small-molecule inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (gefitinib and erlotinib) and monoclonal antibody-mediated blockade of the extracellular ligand-binding domain (cetuximab). Lung cancers with EGFR mutations are prevalent among patients who are female, of Asian ethnicity, and nonsmokers; thus, they can obtain benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.;To survey histopathologic findings and examine correlations with EGFR mutations. We mainly focused on component cell types (hobnail, columnar, and polygonal) and presence or absence of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma elements and a micropapillary pattern. Although EGFR mutations can be detected by various methods, including polymerase chain reaction-Invader assay or direct sequencing, these are inconvenient.;Review of the published literature.;Detailed pathologic examination showed significant genotype-phenotype correlations between EGFR mutations and presence of a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component, a micropapillary pattern, and the hobnail cell type.

In addition, the duration of response is often limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of afatinib, an irreversible erbB family blocker, as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic drugs (5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) or mAb ICR62 on the proliferation of a panel of human colorectal tumour cell lines and the association between the expression levels of the EGFR family members and response to treatment. Of the cells examined, EGFR-overexpressing DiFi cells were the most sensitive to treatment with both afatinib (IC50=45 nM) and ICR62 (IC50=4.33 nM). Afatinib also inhibited the growth of other tumour cell lines with IC50 values which ranged from 0.33 µM (CCL-221) to 1.62 µM (HCT-116). A significant association was found between the co-expression of EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 and HER-3 and response to treatment with afatinib (R=0.915, P=0.021). Treat-ment with afatinib and cytotoxic drugs was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of these cells in the sub-G0/G1 and in the S and G2/M phase of the cell cycle, respectively. We conclude that afatinib as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs shows activity in colorectal tumour cells and that determination of the co-expression of HER family members should be conducted in clinical trials using drugs targeting erbB signaling. This approach could lead to the identification of a specific subpopulation of cancer patients more likely to benefit from erbB-directed therapy.",

Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors have shown promise in treating some of these tumors. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is an aggressive neoplasm that occurs in young patients with no history of cirrhosis. This study examines the expression and gene copy number of EGFR in FL-HCC. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded FL-HCC (n = 13) sections were stained with a monoclonal antibody against EGFR. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed using probes against EGFR gene and centromeric region of chromosome 7 (CEP 7). Epidermal growth factor receptor and CEP 7 signals were counted in 50 tumor nuclei per case as well as 300 normal hepatocyte nuclei. The EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio was calculated for each case. Most (92%, 12/13) of FL-HCC showed strong and diffuse staining with anti-EGFR antibody. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was informative in 11 cases, 10 of which showed extra EGFR gene copy numbers (mean, 3.69; range, 3.13-5.0). Epidermal growth factor receptor was overexpressed in all these cases. The mean number of EGFR signals per cell in FL-HCC was double that of normal hepatocytes (3.69 versus 1.80); the mean EGFR/CEP 7 ratio in tumor cells was 1.05. In conclusion, EGFR is strongly overexpressed on the cell membrane in nearly all cases of FL-HCC. Similar gains of chromosome 7 are observed, indicating that the extra EGFR gene copies are due to polysomy rather than gene amplification. The strong expression of EGFR in FL-HCC tumors suggests that they may respond to treatment with EGFR antagonists.",

In the present study, we have developed an adoptive cellular immunotherapy strategy based on the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified cytokine-induced killer (CAR-CIK) cells specific for the tumor cells expressing EGFR. To generate CAR-CIK cells, a lentiviral vector coding the EGFR-specific CAR was constructed and transduced into the CIK cells. The CAR-CIK cells showed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and increased production of cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 when co-cultured with EGFR-positive cancer cells. In tumor xenografts, adoptive immunotherapy of CAR-CIK cells could inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival of EGFR-overexpressing human tumor xenografts. Moreover, tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival in mice with EGFR(+) human cancer were associated with the increased persistence of CAR-CIK cells in vivo.

Proliferation of normal cervical cells was enhanced by IL-6 but inhibited by its soluble receptor. However, both IL-6 and its soluble receptor significantly stimulated growth of the three immortal and four cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines analyzed. Stimulation by IL-6 was dose dependent and was blocked by an antibody that neutralized IL-6 activity. IL-6-mediated proliferation was accompanied by increased expression of RNAs encoding transforming growth factor-alpha and amphiregulin, two epidermal growth factor receptor ligands. Furthermore, growth stimulation by IL-6 was significantly inhibited by antibodies that either blocked signal transduction by the epidermal growth factor receptor or that neutralized transforming growth factor-alpha or amphiregulin activity.

This highlights the need for better therapeutic options. Epidermal growth factor receptor is overexpressed in 90% of HNSCC patients and is an attractive therapeutic target in this patient population. Afatinib is a potent, irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor. Preliminary studies in HNSCC show promising activity.;This article reviews the current data evaluating small molecules inhibitors of the ErbB family in the treatment of HNSCC with a specific emphasis on afatinib, a second-generation, irreversible, pan-ErbB inhibitor. It also provides a description of afatinib's drug characteristics, pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile as well as details of the published and ongoing clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in HNSCC patients.;Phase II trials in HNSCC show that daily oral treatment with afatinib is tolerable. Most common toxicities are skin rash and diarrhea. Afatinib has clinical activity as a single agent in a subset of refractory and/or metastatic HNSCC patients. It is thought that ongoing Phase III trials should better clarify the role of this compound in the treatment of HNSCC.",

Lamellipodin (Lpd) is known to control lamellipodia protrusion by regulating actin filament elongation via Ena/VASP proteins. However, it is unknown whether this mechanism supports endocytosis of the EGFR. Here, we have identified a novel role for Lpd and Mena in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of the EGFR. We have discovered that endogenous Lpd is in a complex with the EGFR and Lpd and Mena knockdown impairs EGFR endocytosis. Conversely, overexpressing Lpd substantially increases the EGFR uptake in an F-actin-dependent manner, suggesting that F-actin polymerization is limiting for EGFR uptake. Furthermore, we found that Lpd directly interacts with endophilin, a BAR domain containing protein implicated in vesicle fission. We identified a role for endophilin in EGFR endocytosis, which is mediated by Lpd. Consistently, Lpd localizes to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) just before vesicle scission and regulates vesicle scission. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which Lpd mediates EGFR endocytosis via Mena downstream of endophilin. ",

We have used the monoclonal antibody 124 to investigate BCL-2 expression in 212 breast carcinomas, and to correlate it with the oestrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status, and with other clinicopathological variables including tumour type, grade, stage, growth fraction (as evaluated by Ki-67 immunostaining), and p53 accumulation. Of the 212 carcinomas, 173 (81.6%) exhibited BCL-2 immunoreactivity in more than 25% of the neoplastic cells. BCL-2 immunoreactivity was strongly correlated with ER and PR expression (P < 0.00001), with the lobular type (P = 0.012) and with better differentiated neoplasms (P = 0.00003), whereas it was inversely correlated with EGFR (P < 0.00001), p53 (P = 0.0004) and Ki-67 (P = 0.0002) immunoreactivities.

        "Doc_abstract":"The invasive and metastatic transformation of cancers often results in death. However, the mechanisms that promote this transformation remain unclear. Two closely related receptors, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2, are overexpressed in a significant percentage of breast and prostate carcinomas, among others, with this up-regulated signaling correlating with tumor progression. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that an EGFR-phospholipase C (PLC)gamma-mediated motility-associated signaling pathway is rate-limiting for tumor cell invasion in vitro and in vivo in one model of prostate carcinoma. Therefore, we investigated whether this PLCgamma signaling pathway also was rate-limiting for invasion in other tumor cell lines and types and whether this EGFR activity is subsumed by the closely related ErbB2. We determined the effects of PLCgamma signal abrogation by pharmacological (U73122) and molecular (expression of the dominant-negative PLCz) means on the in vitro invasiveness of tumor cells. Inhibition of PLCgamma signaling concomitantly decreased invasiveness of de novo-occurring transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) lines and the human breast cancer cell lines MDA-468 and MDA-231; these lines present up-regulated EGFR signaling. Because the prostate and breast cancer lines usually present autocrine stimulatory loops involving EGFR, we also examined transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate C1 and MDA-468 treated with the EGFR-specific kinase inhibitor PD153035 to determine whether invasiveness is dependent on EGFR signaling. PD153035 reduced invasiveness to levels similar to those seen with U73122, suggesting that the autocrine EGFR stimulatory loop is functioning to promote invasiveness. To determine whether this signaling pathway also promotes invasiveness of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors, we examined the human breast carcinoma line MDA-361; again, U73122 inhibition of PLCgamma decreased invasiveness. In all situations, the inhibition of PLCgamma signaling did not decrease mitogenic signaling. Thus, the motility-associated PLCgamma signaling pathway is a generalizable rate-limiting step for tumor cell progression.",

Infection of two HNSCC cell lines, SCC25 and CAL27 by an Ad5 mutant (lp11w) defective in coding for the viral anti-apoptosis protein, E1B-19K efficiently induced apoptotic cell death. In cells infected with lp11w there was a dramatic down-regulation of EGFR by apoptosis-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-xL and MCL-1 were also down-regulated in lp11w-infected cells compared to uninfected or Ad5-RM infected cells. Infection with lp11w also enhanced sensitivity of the HNSCC cells to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin.

The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive role of IGF-1R expression in the response to EGFR-TKIs of NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations.;We retrospectively studied 62 NSCLC patients who had activating EGFR mutations and received TKIs. Protein expression of IGF-1R, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were measured by immunohistochemical staining. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictive factors associated with the responses to EGFR-TKIs. The relationship of progression-free survival (PFS) with IGF-1R expression and the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) were examined.;Of 62 EGFR mutation positive patients, 26 expressed IGF-1R, and 13 had DM. In the multivariate analysis, young age, squamous cell carcinoma, and IGF-1R expression were independently associated with a shorter PFS after treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Patients expressing IGF-1R showed a significantly shorter PFS in response to EGFR-TKIs compared with those lacking IGF-1R expression (9.1 vs. 20.1 months, p=0.005). The 13 patients with DM were more likely to express IGF-1R (p=0.001) and had shorter PFS times when treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs (7.6 vs. 18.6 months, p=0.005), compared with those without DM.;IGF-1R expression was a negative predictive factor for a response to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations. Moreover, patients with DM highly expressed IGF-1R in tumor tissues, which was associated with a poor response to first-line TKI therapy. Further studies aimed at overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance will need to also address IGF-1R pathways.",

Also, an increase in TGF-alpha synthesis and secretion usually occurs in human carcinoma cell lines. In this study, we compared the immunoreactivities of TGF-alpha and EGF-R in ovarian tumors and related immunohistochemical findings to the histological type of the tumors. Formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissue sections from 40 patients who had serous-mucinous borderline tumor and serous-mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary (n=10 each) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and labeled for binding of primary antibodies against TGF-alpha and EGF-R using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. A semi-quantitative grading system was used to compare immunohistochemical labeling intensities. Increased immunoreactivity of EGF-R and moderate immunoreactivity of TGF-alpha was detected in adenocarcinomas.

Several randomized trials comparing third-generation platinum-based doublets concluded that all such combinations are comparable in their clinical efficacy, failing to document a difference based on histology. However, recent evidences, arising from the availability of pemetrexed, have shown that histology represents an important variable in the decision making. The major progresses in the understanding cancer biology and mechanism of oncogenesis have allowed the development of several potential molecular targets for cancer treatment such as vascular growth factor and its receptors and epidermal growth factor receptor. Targeted drugs seem to be safer or more effective in a specific histology subtype. All of these data have led to choose the optimal first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC based on histologic diagnosis.

Suzui et al., Cancer Res., 62: 3997-4006, 2002). In this study we examined the cellular and molecular effects of ACR on human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. ACR inhibited growth of the esophageal SCC cell line HCE7, and the head and neck SCC cell lines YCU-N861 and YCU-H891, with IC(50) values of approximately 10, 25, and 40 microM, respectively. Detailed studies were then done with HCE7 cells. Treatment of these cells with 10 microM ACR caused an increase of cells in G(0)-G(1) and induced apoptosis. This was associated with two phases of molecular events. During phase 1, which occurred within 6-12 h, there was an increase in the retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) and p21(CIP1) proteins, and their corresponding mRNAs, and a decrease in the hyperphosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein. During phase 2, which occurred at approximately 24 h, there was a decrease in the cellular level of transforming growth factor alpha, and the phosphorylated (i.e., activated) forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor, Stat3, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase proteins, and a decrease in both cyclin D1 protein and mRNA. Reporter assays indicated that ACR inhibited the transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1, c-fos, and activator protein promoters. On the other hand, ACR markedly stimulated the activity of a retinoic acid response element-CAT reporter when the cells were cotransfected with a RARbeta expression vector. A hypothetical model explaining these two phases is presented. The diverse effects that we obtained with ACR suggest that this agent might be useful in the chemoprevention and/or therapy of human SCCs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1 or EGFR) has been found to be altered in a variety of human cancers. A number of agents targeting these receptors, including specific antibodies directed against the ligand-binding domain of the receptor and small molecules that inhibit kinase activity are either in clinical trials or are already approved for clinical treatment. However, identifying patients that are likely to respond to such treatments has been challenging. As a consequence, it still remains important to identify additional alterations of the tumor cell that contribute to the response to EGFR-targeted agents. While EGFR-mediated signalling pathways have been well established, there is still a rather limited understanding of how intracellular protein-protein interactions, ubiquitination, endocytosis and subsequent degradation of EGFR contribute to the determination of sensitivity to EGFR targeting agents and are emerging areas of investigation. This review primarily focuses on the basic signal transduction pathways mediated through activated membrane bound and/or endosomal EGFR and emphasizes the need to co-target additional proteins that function either upstream or downstream of EGFR to improve cancer therapy.",

However, oxidized SLO produces beneficial therapeutic effects in vivo on scleroderma, scar formation and wound healing. Here we report that oxidized SLO also significantly inhibited invasion by human metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells through Matrigel in an in vitro model of metastatic disease. This dose-dependent response corresponded to selective SLO activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ErbB1. SLO and EGF were equally selective in activation of EGFR, but EGF elicited larger relative increases in phosphorylation at various sites, especially pronounced for Tyr845. Addition of SLO did not affect either ERK1/2 or Akt kinases and altered the expression of only 10 of 84 metastasis-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Neither SLO nor EGF promoted growth of several human breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of EGFR by siRNA ablated the inhibitory effect of SLO on cancer cell invasion, showing SLO selectively activated ErbB1 kinase to reduce invasion without increasing cell growth. The results suggest SLO might have promise as a new therapy to inhibit metastasis.",

Current treatment options of advanced stage thymomas and thymic carcinomas include a multimodal therapy with radio- and chemotherapy as well as surgery. In recent years, new therapeutic targets such as EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), COX-2 and KIT have emerged as new potential therapeutic targets. So far, EGFR mutational status of different subtypes of epithelial tumours of the thymus has been analyzed only inappropriately. We have investigated 20 different subtypes of thymomas (type A, AB, and B3) and thymic carcinomas for mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the EGFR gene and performed immunohistochemistry for EGFR. Concerning immunohistochemistry, most of the cases (17/20) had a strong positive staining. Although sequence alterations were found in four samples, none of these alterations led to amino acid changes in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR comparable to those in non-small cell lung cancer. Thus EGFR-expression in thymic tumours does not rely on mutations in critical functional (activation) domains of the EGFR-gene. Experimental and therapeutic approaches have to consider this difference.",

Recent studies revealed that the kinase domain of the ERBB2 gene was mutated in human cancers, including gastric cancer. Despite the importance of cancer metastasis in the pathogenesis of cancers, data on the ERBB2 kinase domain mutation in cancer metastasis are lacking. In this study, to explore the possibility that ERBB2 mutation is involved in the metastasis mechanism, we analyzed the kinase domain of ERBB2 for the detection of somatic mutations in 58 gastric adenocarcinomas with lymph node metastasis. We found one ERBB2 mutation, which was detected in the lymph node metastasis, but not in the primary tumor of the same patient. The ERBB2 mutation was a missense mutation which substituted an amino acid in exon 21 (V832I). We simultaneously analyzed the somatic mutations of EGFR, K-RAS, PIK3CA and BRAF genes in the sample with the ERBB2 mutation, and found that this metastatic carcinoma did not harbor any of the mutations. Our data suggest that ERBB2 kinase domain mutation occasionally occurs in metastatic gastric carcinoma and might play a role in the metastatic process of some gastric carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This study aimed to describe a short-term ex vivo assay to predict response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy (gefitinib) in adenocarcinoma patients. Four patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma were treated with gefitinib (250 mg/day) for 14 days and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted to monitor plasma drug concentrations. Tumor cells were sampled by endoscopic biopsy prior to (baseline, day 0) and at the completion of (day 14) treatment. Cells obtained at baseline were exposed to gefitinib in short-term cell culture conditions (ex vivo assay). Western blot analyses with phospho-specific antibodies were performed to evaluate activation and biochemical response to therapy of EGFR and its downstream signaling components ERK and AKT ex vivo and in vivo. The in vivo profiles were correlated with the gefitinib-mediated alteration in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, a marker of cell proliferation. The correlation between EGFR expression and ERK activity was also investigated by immunohistochemical analysis in pretreatment biopsies. Mutational status of the genes encoding EGFR, K-RAS, and PI3KCA (the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit p110) as well as expression levels of PTEN protein were tested in order to investigate potential confounders of the gefitinib effect. All patients completed the gefitinib therapy. PK studies demonstrated constant gefitinib concentrations during the treatment, confirming persistent exposure of target tissue to the drug at sufficient levels to achieve EGFR blockade. Ex vivo culture with gefitinib resulted in distinct response patterns representing various states of activity of the ERK and AKT pathways. The results of the ex vivo studies correctly predicted the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the agents in tumor tissue in vivo. PCNA expression correlated with ERK pathway inhibition, but not with gefitinib-mediated inhibition of EGFR activity alone. Immunohistochemical analysis performed on pretreatment biopsies correlated with Western blot analysis of EGFR and phospho-ERK expression. No mutations were identified in exons 18-21 of EGFR, exons 2 and 3 of K-RAS or exons 9 and 22 of PI3KCA. Levels of PTEN were comparable across tumors. The novel pharmacodynamic approach described in this proof of principle study may be useful to refine the patient selection to maximize the potential benefits of drugs and design individualized rational therapies for cancer patients.",

Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/c-erbB-1) and/or its ligands and high levels of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of EGFR ligands on gelatinase expression and invasion in HNSCC cell lines. We tested epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF, and amphiregulin and measured expression of gelatinases MMP-9 and MMP-2 in an established squamous carcinoma cell line (Detroit-562) and in two cell lines newly derived from patients with head and neck cancers (SIHN-005A and SIHN-006). Incubation of the cell lines with EGF-like ligands up-regulated MMP-9 (but not MMP-2) expression as measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR in a dose-dependent manner, with the effects being most marked in cells with high EGFR levels and undetectable in cells with low levels. Maximum stimulation was obtained in a concentration range of 10-100 nM. In addition, we confirmed by zymography that gelatinolytic activity consistent with MMP-9 (Mr 92,000) was up-regulated in parallel with increases in gene expression. Betacellulin (which binds both to EGFR and c-erbB-4 receptors) consistently increased MMP-9 expression and activation to a significantly greater degree than the other four ligands when tested at equimolar concentrations. In parallel with MMP-9 up-regulation, all EGF-like ligands increased tumor cell invasion through Matrigel in in vitro Transwell assays. These activities were independent of ligand effects on cell proliferation. Antagonist (ICR62) or agonist (ICR9) anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, respectively, inhibited or potentiated MMP-9 activity and tumor cell invasion induced by all ligands. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes MMP-9 activity (Abl) also inhibited ligand-induced invasion of HNSCC. We confirmed that tumor cell lines used in these studies (and a larger series not reported here) generally expressed multiple c-erbB receptors and ligands. These results indicate that autocrine or paracrine signaling through EGFR potentiates the invasive potential of HNSCC via the selective up-regulation and activation of MMP-9. Furthermore, ligands such as betacellulin (which is commonly expressed in HNSCC), which can bind to and activate other c-erbB receptors, may be especially potent in this regard.",

A panel of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines was used to study the combination of C225 and radiation.;It was determined that the combination of C225 (5 microgram/mL) delivered simultaneously with radiation (3 Gy) resulted in a greater decrement in cellular proliferation than either treatment alone. This reduction in proliferation correlated with reduced EGFr tyrosine phosphorylation and a reduction in phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) protein (known to protect cells from apoptosis). Also, the decrement in proliferation correlated with increased apoptotic events, thereby indirectly linking C225/radiation-induced regulation of STAT-3 protein to apoptosis.;This preclinical work serves as important support for the ongoing clinical investigation of C225 and radiotherapy for patients with head and neck carcinomas.

A PUBMED research 2011 - 2013 has been conducted using the following terms: 'Non-melanoma skin cancer AND cetuximab', 'cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma AND cetuximab', and 'basal cell carcinoma AND cetuximab' and 'cetuximab AND skin toxicity'. Available data were analyzed - irrespective of their level of evidence, that is, case reports and case series were included.;Current evidence of cetuximab's efficacy in NMSC was mainly obtained in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to a lesser extent in basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Response rates vary for neoadjuvant, adjuvant, monotherapy and combined therapy with cetuximab. Limitations are the low number of patients treated (33 patients with SCC, 4 patients with BCC) and the low quality of studies reported. Management of cutaneous toxicities of EGFR inhibitors is necessary, and guidelines are available. Proactive therapy might also prevent skin toxicity of higher grades, with EGFR inhibitor cetuximab as an option for recurrent or advanced NMSC of the skin.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor that mediates proliferation and survival signaling, is expressed in a wide variety of normal and neoplastic tissues. EGFR inhibitors have produced objective responses in patients with non-small cell lung carcinomas harboring activating EGFR TK domain somatic mutations. We evaluated the presence of mutations in BRAF (exons 11 and 15), KRAS (exons 1 and 2), NRAS (exons 1 and 2), and EGFR (exons 18-21) in adrenal carcinomas (35 tumor specimens and two cell lines) by DNA sequencing. BRAF mutations were found in two carcinomas (5.7%). Four carcinomas (11.4%) carried EGFR TK domain mutations. One specimen carried a KRAS mutation, and another carried two NRAS mutations. No mutations were found in the two adrenocortical cell lines. BRAF- and EGFR-mutant tumor specimens exhibited stronger immunostaining for the phosphorylated forms of the MEK and ERK kinases than their wild-type counterparts. EGFR-mutant carcinomas exhibited increased phosphorylation of EGFR (Tyr 992) compared with wild-type carcinomas. We conclude that BRAF, RAS, and EGFR mutations occur in a subset of human adrenocortical carcinomas.

Since treatment with TKIs has furthermore shown a clinical benefit in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, we hypothesized that these mutations could also be present in this neoplasia. Current studies looking for EGFR mutations in HNSCC are limited and results are still controversial. In this work, we screened for EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations in tumour DNA obtained from 31 Spanish patients with HNSCC by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. None of the patients displayed a somatic EGFR mutation, previously described in NSCLC, but other DNA sequence variations were found in 9 of 31 HNSCC patients. Accordingly, activating EGFR mutations in HNSCC patients seem to be a rare event in Spanish patients, suggesting that there is little room for the administration of TKIs in HNSCC based on the presence of these mutations.

In general, the structure and mechanism of the activation of these members are similar. However, significant differences in homologous desensitization are known between EGFR and ErbB4. Desensitization of ligand-occupied EGFR occurs by endocytosis, while that of ErbB4 occurs by selective cleavage at the cell surface. Because ErbB4 is abundantly expressed in neurons from fetal to adult brains, elucidation of the desensitization mechanism is important to understand neuronal development and synaptic functions. Recently, it has become clear that heterologous desensitization of EGFR and ErbB4 are induced by endocytosis and cleavage, respectively, similar to homologous desensitization. It has been reported that heterologous desensitization of EGFR is induced by serine phosphorylation of EGFR via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAP kinase) pathway in various cell lines, including alveolar epithelial cells. In contrast, the protein kinase C pathway is involved in ErbB4 cleavage. In this review, we will describe recent advances in the desensitization mechanisms of EGFR and ErbB4, mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and hypothalamic neurons, respectively. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in a significant proportion of hepatocellular carcinomas. Recent studies of EGFR inhibitors to treat hepatocellular carcinoma have been encouraging and better understanding of EGFR signaling may lead to more effective strategies for inhibiting this key pathway. The EGFR can be phosphorylated at different tyrosine sites, leading to subsequent activation of different pathways. Cell line and animal studies have shown that MAPK and STAT-3 are important mediators of the EGFR signal in liver cells. However, little is known about EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent signaling in primary hepatocellular carcinoma. We investigated the site of EGFR phosphorylation by Western blot in 18 hepatocellular carcinomas. Fourteen of 18 hepatocellular carcinomas had detectable EGFR by Western blotting and 13 of 14 showed phosphorylation at tyrosine 845. In contrast, no EGFR phosphorylation was detected at tyrosine 998, tyrosine 1045, or tyrosine 1068, which signal through other pathways including STAT-3 and MAPK. These findings were further explored by examination of EGFR expression and signaling pathway activation in tissue arrays comprised of 73 hepatocellular carcinomas using antibodies that recognize phosphorylated (or activated) proteins. Tissue array studies also found no correlation between EGFR expression (29% of cases) and STAT-3 nuclear positivity (16%), AKT (4%), MAPK (3%), or STAT-5 (3%) positivity, all P>0.05. EGFR expression was correlated with hepatitis B infection, but not with tumor size, nuclear grade, or proliferative rate. We conclude that EGFR is phosphorylated at tyrosine 845 in most hepatocellular carcinomas and that EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry does not correlate well with STAT-3, STAT-5, MAPK, or AKT immunostaining.",

Recently, attention has been paid to growth factors and growth factor receptors as possible pathogenetic factors of malignancy, even if not enough studies have been performed to exploit their role in oral diseases. Aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) in squamous carcinomas arising in patients with LRP. The study has been performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue biopsies obtained from 11 patients with previous diagnosis of LRP in which squamous carcinoma had developed. A monoclonal anti-EGFr antibody has been used, with the ABC technique, on histological sections. EGFr has been immunolocalized in basal and suprabasal epithelial layers in LRP with the highest intensity of staining in the areas with strong inflammation. EGFr immunostaining could be detected in dysplastic areas as well, even if the intensity of staining seemed to decrease with severity of dysplasia. In well-differentiated squamous carcinoma EGFr was intensely expressed, especially in mature keratinized cells. Weaker or absent EGFr immunoreaction was detected in moderately and poorly differentiated carcinomas. The results of the present study seem to show that EGFr is expressed in squamous carcinomas arising from LRP. The variability of EGFr expression in inflamed oral mucosa, in dysplastic areas and in tumors with different degrees of differentiation seem to point out that EGFr might somehow regulate the maturation and replication of epithelial cells in LRP and in its malignant counterpart. The speculations achieved from the present study need further evaluation on wider series of cases and, possibly, with different antibodies which would allow the identification of mutant forms of the receptor.",

Beside this host defence function several AMPs play a role in the regulation of inflammation and tissue repair. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the human cathelicidin AMP LL-37/hCAP-18 is involved in the biology of lung cancer. Human cancer cell lines were found to express the human cathelicidin LL-37/hCAP-18 mRNA and peptide at different levels. Immunohistochemistry of human lung cancers showed that the peptide is expressed mostly in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Application of exogenous LL-37 at low concentrations of 5ng/ml to cancer cell lines increased proliferation and growth of anchorage-independent colonies. At the molecular level, LL-37 induced phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and activation of downstream MAP kinase signalling pathways. Lung cancer cell lines that stably overexpress the peptide by means of a doxycycline-regulated promoter system also showed a faster growth. When these cell lines were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, cathelicidin overexpression resulted in increased tumourigenicity and the formation of significantly larger tumours. In conclusion, cathelicidin is expressed in human lung cancers. The peptide activates tumour cells resulting in increased cell growth in vitro and in an animal model.

Previous studies suggested that the gene expression is related to histological subtype and smoking exposure, since in small cell lung cancers the RBM5 gene is deleted whereas in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) RBM5 expression is reduced. Of particular interest was the recent finding that in lung adenocarcinomas, a histological subtype of NSCLC, smoking exposure correlated with mutational activity in the transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-a) signaling pathway. Lung adenocarcinomas from smokers were associated with activating KRAS mutations, whereas lung adenocarcinomas from never-smokers were associated with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. We hypothesized that inhibition of RBM5 in lung adenocarcinomas is achieved indirectly via these activating mutations. The objective of the research described herein was to determine if EGFR activation and RBM5 expression are negatively correlated.;EGFR expression in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line NCI-H1975 was inhibited using small interfering RNA. RBM5 expression was examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.;Reduced EGFR expression did not correlate with any change in RBM5 expression at either the RNA or protein level.;These results suggest that RBM5 expression is not directly regulated by EGFR in non-smoker related lung adenocarinomas, and that some other mechanism operates to inhibit either the expression or function of this potential tumour suppressor in lung cancers that retain the RBM5 gene.",

Wild type and mutated (exon 19 deletion) EGFR-expressing cells responded similarly to cisplatin by showing MAPK-mediated EGFR phosphorylation.

Here, we present a case of an EGFR-mutant gefitinib-responsive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma histology occurring in a never-smoker followed by subsequent diagnosis of metastatic SCLC carrying an EGFR mutation. Although gefitinib therapy of the primary NSCLC resulted in disease control for over 3 years, the patient subsequently developed metastatic SCLC to the liver. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation analysis revealed that the exon 21 L858R activating mutation was present in both the original lung adenocarcinoma and the metastatic SCLC. We hypothesize that SCLC either evolved from the previously diagnosed NSCLC or that both arose from a common precursor. Further comparative molecular analysis of these histologically distinct tumors would be of value to better understand the potential role of EGFR in the pathogenesis of SCLC in never-smokers, and the role of selection for an EGFR-mutant SCLC subclone as an unusual mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC.",

Mutations in BRAF have led to clinical use of BRAF-inhibitors in advanced melanoma, and mutations in Hedgehog signaling to smoothened inhibitors in basal cell carcinoma. The development of tumor resistance to these treatments is leading to many new drug development initiatives and the exploration of multiple signalling pathways. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma continues to rise steeply in incidence with very limited therapeutic options for locally advanced or metastatic disease. New genetic technologies find significant levels of mutation in Notch gene family as well as other already recognized gene mutations, such as TP53. The mutational burden in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is massive, challenging the identification of driver genes and inhibiting translation from genomics to the clinic. Clinical experience with targeted therapies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, or immune modulatory drugs suggests that these agents may be of benefit to patients, while a more complete understanding of the mechanisms behind squamous cell carcinogenesis awaits further progress.

        "Doc_abstract":"Growth factor receptors are of great interest as molecular targets for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Growth factor receptors are frequently over expressed on malignant cell populations since many cellular oncogenes encode either growth factors or their receptors. The wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor has a molecular weight of 170 kD and is over expressed on gliomas, bladder tumors, squamous cells carcinomas and breast carcinomas. Another growth factor oncogene, c-erbB-2, encodes a 185-kD glycoprotein found on the surface of gliomas, breast and ovarian cancers as well as other carcinomas of epithelial origin. In addition to causing over expression, oncogenic transformation also can result in genomic re-arrangements. An important example from the perspective of targeting is EGFRvIII, a deletion mutant which lacks amino acids 6-273 in the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor. The EGFRvIII molecule (145 kD) may be of great value for targeting because it appears to be tumor-specific. Antibodies have been developed with specific reactivity with these growth factor receptors. Since these antibodies are internalized into the cell after receptor binding, it is necessary to use radiolabeling methods which residualize the radioactivity in the tumor cell after intracellular catabolism. To investigate this problem, we have evaluated the effect of radioiodination method on the in vitro and in vivo properties of an anti-EGFRvIII antibody. Methods studied were Iodogen, tyramine-cellobiose, and N-succinimidyl 5-iodo-3-pyridine-carboxylate with the last offering optimal localization in a human xenograft model.",

Six Braf mutations were found in the adenocarcinoma cases. Among the adenocarcinoma cases, Braf mutations were more frequently noted in heavy smokers (Brinkman index >400, p=0.0476). We also detected five erbB2 mutations all in the non-smokers. All of these mutations existed exclusively. The erbB2 gene mutations were predominantly found in non-smokers with adenocarcinomas.

Recently, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies have shown to be clinically useful in penile carcinomas. Nevertheless, only a few cases of penile carcinomas have been evaluated for EGFR expression. In this study, we assessed the immunohistochemical expression of EGFR in 112 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. We built 4 tissue microarrays and evaluated EGFR expression using a monoclonal mouse anti-EGFR antibody. For digital image analysis, we used the open-source software ImageJ version 1.47 (NIH, Bethesda, MD) along with the immunomembrane plug-in. Membranous EGFR expression was evaluated, taking into account staining completeness (0-10 points) and staining intensity (0-10 points) for a combined score (0-20 points). We classified the cases as follows: negative EGFR expression, 0 to 3 points; low EGFR expression, 4 to 8 points; and high EGFR expression, 9 to 20 points. The distribution of EGFR immunohistochemical expression was as follows: 13 cases (12%) were EGFR negative, 49 cases (44%) had low EGFR expression, and 50 cases (44%) had high EGFR expression. EGFR expression was not associated with histologic subtype (P = .47), histologic grade (P = .77), or human papillomavirus status (P = .14). In conclusion, immunohistochemical EGFR expression appears to be a common feature of penile carcinomas, independently of histologic subtype, histologic grade, and human papillomavirus presence. Whether or not EGFR expression is associated with EGFR gene mutation or if it can be used to predict response to therapy in patients with disseminated penile cancer should be evaluated in future studies.

Due to some disadvantages of monoclonal antibodies, a new approach in blocking human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 dimerization and activation is designing peptidomimetic ligands based on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-Trastuzumab interaction model.

In this study, herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5 was used as a benchmark peptidomimetic compound to perform a ligand-based virtual screening followed by structure-based screening by applying the molecular docking approach. The study aimed to explore more potent peptidomimetic molecules against extracellular part of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Our results showed that the newly designed peptidomimetic herceptin-based peptidomimetic n33B in comparison with herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5 binds more tightly to the extracellular domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Mechanistic aspects of herceptin-based peptidomimetic n33B interaction with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 were more investigated through 20-ns molecular dynamic simulations. Additionally, a quantitative structure-activity relationships study was performed to develop a model for identification of structural determinants in herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5-based peptidomimetics.",

We identified target antigens of spontaneous tumor-specific T cell responses in urothelial carcinoma (UC) and evaluated their modulation by treatment and Treg. We determined Treg target antigens in UC. Fifty-six UC and 13 control patients were prospectively enrolled. Blood was drawn before and after routine treatment. Changes in Treg frequency were measured by fluorescence cytometry and the T effector cell (Teff) response against a set of nine tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) was monitored with an interferon-gamma ELISpot. Antigen specificity of Treg was determined by their increased capacity to inhibit after TAA-specific activation the proliferation of an autologous T cell population. The highest difference in the overall response rate for the total T cell population was observed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (UC: 23% and controls: 0%). After depleting Treg, also new york esophageal (NYES)O1 (19 and 0%) and MUC20 (27 and 0%) were more frequently recognized in UC patients. In metastasized patients, the TAA-directed T cell response was augmented by Treg depletion. Tumor resection seemed to diminish Treg suppression of TAA-specific immunity, whereas chemotherapy had no effect. We demonstrated the existence of TAA-specific Treg in UC, which share antigen specificities with Teff. The coexistence of TAA-specific Treg and Teff was very rare. Treg frequencies in the peripheral blood were not changed by therapy. In summary, we identified potentially immunologically relevant TAA in UC.

Using machine learning analysis applied to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database, we identified expression of AXL, the gene that encodes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL, as exceptionally predictive of lack of response to ErbB family receptor-targeted inhibitors. Activation of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) transactivated AXL, and this ligand-independent AXL activity diversified EGFR-induced signaling into additional downstream pathways beyond those triggered by EGFR alone. AXL-mediated signaling diversification was required for EGF (epidermal growth factor)-elicited motility responses in AXL-positive TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) cells. Using cross-linking coimmunoprecipitation assays, we determined that AXL associated with EGFR, other ErbB receptor family members, MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) but not IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) or INSR (insulin receptor). From these AXL interaction data, we predicted AXL-mediated signaling synergy for additional RTKs and validated these predictions in cells. This alternative mechanism of receptor activation limits the use of ligand-blocking therapies and indicates against therapy withdrawal after acquired resistance. Further, subadditive interaction between EGFR- and AXL-targeted inhibitors across all AXL-positive TNBC cell lines may indicate that increased abundance of EGFR is principally a means to transactivation-mediated signaling.

The standard of care for most clinicians is a multidisciplinary treatment with concomitant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (CRT).

For this reason a renewed interest has appeared for the incorporation of induction chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced Head and Neck Cancer. Furthermore new combination regimens with taxanes have shown to be more active than the classical cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil induction regimen.

Newer agents achieving this goal include perillyl alcohol, T4 endonuclease 5, DL-alpha-tocopherol, and alpha-difluoromethylornithine.

These newer therapies have achieved significant reductions in morbidity and mortality. Procedural modalities that have been evolving into important tools for the treatment of actinic keratosis and nonmelanoma skin cancers include photodynamic therapy and lasers.

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic urachal carcinoma is a rare, understudied, and aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. Histologically, urachal carcinomas resemble enteric adenocarcinomas and anecdotally respond to systemic therapies utilized in colorectal cancer. Targeted exome sequencing of archival primary tumor tissue from a patient with metastatic urachal cancer revealed EGFR amplification and wild-type KRAS. The patient was treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR, as a single agent, and achieved a response lasting more than 8 mo. Subsequent whole-exome sequencing revealed no additional alterations likely to be associated with cetuximab sensitivity. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from nine additional urachal cancers were subjected to targeted exome sequencing. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations were found in four of the nine samples, but no EGFR amplification was detected. Importantly, APC mutations were detected in two of the nine patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a response to single-agent cetuximab in a patient with metastatic urachal cancer and of molecular analysis to probe the basis for sensitivity. On the basis of these findings and the histologic, and now genomic, similarities with colorectal cancer, monoclonal antibodies directed at EGFR could be used in the treatment of metastatic urachal cancer.;Urachal cancers are morphologically and genomically similar to colon adenocarcinomas and may respond to drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor.",

We observed known mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI, including the EGFR T790M mutation, MET gene amplification and loss of PTEN in the gefitinib-resistant HCC827-8-1 cells.

EGFR mutations were more frequently found in women (110 of 185, 59.5%), adenocarcinoma (183 of 185, 98.9%), patients with no vascular invasion (139 of 185, 75.1%) and nonsmokers (106 of 185, 57.3%). In patients with pathological stage I adenocarcinoma, both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly higher in patients with EGFR mutation than in those with wild-type EGFR. Furthermore, patients with exon 21 mutation have better DFS than those with exon 19 mutation in stage IB adenocarcinoma.

The importance of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the development and progression of many solid tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, is well understood; increased expression is associated with enhanced tumor invasiveness, resistance to chemotherapy, and a lower patient survival rate. Several approaches have been developed to achieve EGFR blockade as an anticancer treatment strategy, including the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody IMC-C225, which competitively binds to the extracellular receptor site and prevents binding by the natural EGFR ligands EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha. Preclinical studies to evaluate IMC-225 in human cancer cell lines in vitro and human tumor xenografts in vivo have shown its potent antitumor activity. Clinical efficacy of IMC-C225 appears to involve multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, inhibition of metastasis, and enhancement of the response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Phase I studies of IMC-C225 combined with chemotherapy or radiation showed promising response rates in patients with recurrent or refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Phase II and III trials to examine the efficacy and safety of these combinations are currently underway. To date, IMC-C225 has been well tolerated, with skin rashes and allergic reactions being the most clinically important adverse events reported. IMC-C225 displays dose-dependent elimination characteristics and a half-life of approximately 7 days.

        "Doc_abstract":"Members of the EGFR/ErbB family of tyrosine kinases are found to be highly expressed and deregulated in many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The ErbB family, including EGFR, has been demonstrated to play key roles in metastasis, tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, and drug resistance. Recently, these characteristics have been linked to a small subpopulation of cells classified as cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are believed to be responsible for tumor initiation and maintenance. In this study, we investigated the possible role of EGFR as a regulator of \"stemness\" in HNSCC cells. Activation of EGFR by the addition of EGF ligand or ectopic expression of EGFR in two established HNSCC cell lines (UMSCC-22B and HN-1) resulted in the induction of CD44, BMI-1, Oct-4, NANOG, CXCR4, and SDF-1. Activation of EGFR also resulted in increased tumorsphere formation, a characteristic ability of cancer stem cells. Conversely, treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor, Gefinitib (Iressa), resulted in decreased expression of the aforementioned genes, and loss of tumorsphere-forming ability. Similar trends were observed in a 99.9% CD44 positive stem cell culture derived from a fresh HNSCC tumor, confirming our findings for the cell lines. Additionally, we found that these putative cancer stem cells, when treated with Gefitinib, possessed a lower capacity to invade and became more sensitive to cisplatin-induced death in vitro. These results suggest that EGFR plays critical roles in the survival, maintenance, and function of cancer stem cells. Drugs that target EGFR, perhaps administered in combination with conventional chemotherapy, might be an effective treatment for HNSCC.",

Sequential specimens were obtained upon detection of metachronous lesions in the lung field.

Our pathologic findings, sequential image information, and genetic data were compared to track evidence of cancer evolution.;Based on EGFR gene analyses of tumor specimens from 431 patients, 17 cases of sequential BAC-related adenocarcinomas, obtained by thoracotomy, were noteworthy. Upon alteration of the BAC/adenocarcinoma components, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-untreated series, which had at least one episode of an EGFR-activating mutation, represented 3 potential hypotheses: no significant EGFR evolution for a single clone, genetic alterations from mutant to wild-type EGFR for multifocal lesions, or a switch from wild-type to mutant EGFR, leading to indeterminable cancer progression.;Genetic analysis, in conjunction with pathologic and radiologic diagnoses, can be used to explore the origin of multifocal BAC. The single-clone model indicates subsequent disease progression, whereas genetic alterations from mutations to wild-type EGFR are suggestive of second primary carcinoma.

Here, we examine the effect of coexpressing varying levels of HERs 1-3 on the receptor dimerization patterns using a detailed kinetic model for HER/ErbB dimerization and trafficking. Our results indicate that coexpression of EGFR with HER2 or HER3 biases signaling to the cell surface and retards signal downregulation. In addition, simultaneous coexpression of HERs 1-3 leads to an abundance of HER2-HER3 heterodimers, which are known to be potent inducers of cell growth and transformation. Our new approach to use parameter dependence analysis in experimental design reveals that measurements of HER3 phosphorylation and HER2 internalization ratio may prove to be especially useful for the estimation of critical model parameters. Further, we examine the effect of receptor dimerization patterns on biological response using a simple phenomenological model. Results indicate that coexpression of EGFR with HER2 and HER3 at low to moderate levels may enable cells to match the response of a high HER2 expresser.",

Human domain antibodies selected against VEGF and EGFR were formatted into a fully human dual-targeting IgG (DT-IgG) to directly target both antigens in a single molecule. We evaluated the efficacy of DT-IgG in comparison with bevacizumab and cetuximab alone and in combination in the lung cancer cell line A549 (low EGFR expression and KRAS mutant) and the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line Tu212 (high EGFR expression and KRAS wild type) in vitro and in vivo. DT-IgG suppressed Tu212 and A549 cell growth, inhibited EGFR activation and induced apoptosis as effectively as cetuximab, and neutralized VEGF as effectively as bevacizumab. DT-IgG induced EGFR-dependent VEGF internalization, constituting a novel antiangiogenesis mechanism. In xenograft models with lung and head and neck cancer cell lines, DT-IgG displayed efficacy equivalent to bevacizumab in diminishing tumor growth despite its short serum half-life (36 hr in rats) and both agents may constitute preferable alternatives to cetuximab in KRAS-mutant tumors. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that localization of DT-IgG was similar to that of cetuximab, largely associated with EGFR+tumor cells. Our proof of principle study suggests a DT-IgG against EGFR and VEGF as an alternative therapeutic strategy with potentially enhanced clinical benefit.",

Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was done using chromogenic detection. The mean signal numbers for EGFR gene and chromosome 7 as well as the EGFR gene/chromosome 7 centromere probe (CEP7) ratio were recorded. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was done on the corresponding paraffin sections. The copy number of the EGFR gene in each tumor/cell line ranged from 1.2 to 5.6. The EGFR gene/CEP7 ratio showed a biological continuum ranging from 0.59 to 1.94 with a mean of 1.04. EGFR gene copy loss was found in 16.6% of cases whereas copy gain was demonstrated in 19.4%. There was no relationship between IHC protein expression of EGFR and EGFR gene copy number or EGFR gene/CEP7 ratio.In conclusion, most breast carcinomas had a balanced EGFR gene/CEP7 copy number with a mean ratio of 1.04.

The tumor microenvironment spontaneously induces both increased expression of the Mena invasive (Mena(INV)) and decreased expression of Mena11a isoforms in invasive and migratory tumor cells. Tumor cells with this Mena expression pattern participate with macrophages in migration and intravasation in mouse mammary tumors in vivo. Consistent with these findings, anatomical sites containing tumor cells with high levels of Mena expression associated with perivascular macrophages were identified in human invasive ductal breast carcinomas and called TMEM. The number of TMEM sites positively correlated with the development of distant metastasis in humans. Here we demonstrate that mouse mammary tumors generated from EGFP-Mena(INV) expressing tumor cells are significantly less cohesive and have discontinuous cell-cell contacts compared to Mena11a xenografts. Using the mouse PyMT model we show that metastatic mammary tumors express 8.7 fold more total Mena and 7.5 fold more Mena(INV) mRNA than early non-metastatic ones. Furthermore, Mena(INV) expression in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) samples of human invasive ductal carcinomas correlate with TMEM score while Mena11a does not. These results suggest that Mena(INV) is the isoform associated with breast cancer cell discohesion, invasion and intravasation in mice and in humans. They also imply that Mena(INV) expression and TMEM score measure related aspects of a common tumor cell dissemination mechanism and provide new insight into metastatic risk.",

In SCC cell lines, PGE(2) receptor (EP) ligation by exogenous PGE(2) promoted the NR4A2 expression in the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. The process required a nature of SCC cell represented by constitutive activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. Targeted inactivation of the EGFRs interfered the PGE(2)-dependent NR4A2 expression. The PGE(2)-dependent NR4A2 induction is essential for the resistance to anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis especially in SCC cells which showed constitutive EGFRs activity via autocrine epiregulin, a ligand for EGFRs. Conversely, SCC cells which lack epiregulin expression in their nature could gain the ability to promote the NR4A2 expression in response to PGE(2) and attain the resistance to anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis under the existence of exogenous epiregulin. These findings suggest that susceptibility of SCC to anti-cancer drug could be compromised when PGE(2) was delivered in the microenvironment of SCC cells supported by constitutive EGFR family activities as their nature.",

Although third-generation EGFR TKIs can suppress the kinase activity of T790M-positive EGFR, they still cannot eradicate EGFR-mutated cancer cells. We previously reported that a subpopulation of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas depends on enhanced autophagy, instead of EGFR, for survival, and in this study we explore another mechanism that contributes to TKI resistance. We demonstrate here that an EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line, H1975 (L858R+T790M), has a subset of cells that exhibits an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and can thrive in the presence of third-generation EGFR TKIs. These cells depend on not only autophagy but also on the isomerase Pin1 for survival in vitro, unlike their parental cells. The Pin1 protein was expressed in an EGFR-mutant lung cancer tissue that has undergone partial EMT and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, but not its primary tumor.

In the nervous system, these family members can function in a trophic capacity for certain subpopulations of neurons and some types of non-neuronal cells. Vestibular sensory epithelial cells and vestibular ganglion neurons are derived from ectodermal otic placode and are essential components of the peripheral vestibular system, the sensory system for balance. Recent studies in mammals suggest that certain ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor can induce proliferation of vestibular sensory epithelial cells. We now show that vestibular ganglion neurons and vestibular sensory epithelial cells express all four erbB receptors in adult rats. Cultured vestibular ganglion neurons also expressed all four erbB family members and were therefore used to analyze the effects of modulating erbB signaling on differentiated vestibular ganglion neurons. Transforming growth factor-alpha (a ligand for epidermal growth factor receptor) and sensory and motor neuron-derived factor (a ligand for erbB3 and erbB4) promoted vestibular ganglion neuron viability, whereas epidermal growth factor (another ligand for epidermal growth factor receptor) did not. Glial growth factor 2 (another ligand for erbB3 and erbB4) and an antibody that blocks erbB2/neu-mediated signaling inhibited vestibular ganglion neuron viability. Collectively, these observations indicate that erbB signaling regulates the viability of differentiated otic placode-derived cells in mammals and suggest that exogenous modulation of erbB signaling in peripheral vestibular tissues may prove therapeutically useful in peripheral vestibular disorders.",

Recent studies have provided compelling evidence that irreversible ErbB inhibitors have the potential to override this resistance. Here, we found that AST1306, a novel anilino-quinazoline compound, inhibited the enzymatic activities of wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 as well as EGFR resistant mutant in both cell-free and cell-based systems. Importantly, AST1306 functions as an irreversible inhibitor, most likely through covalent interaction with Cys797 and Cys805 in the catalytic domains of EGFR and ErbB2, respectively. Further studies showed that AST1306 inactivated pathways downstream of these receptors and thereby inhibited the proliferation of a panel of cancer cell lines. Although the activities of EGFR and ErbB2 were similarly sensitive to AST1306, ErbB2-overexpressing cell lines consistently exhibited more sensitivity to AST1306 antiproliferative effects. Consistent with this, knockdown of ErbB2, but not EGFR, decreased the sensitivity of SK-OV-3 cells to AST1306. In vivo, AST1306 potently suppressed tumor growth in ErbB2-overexpressing adenocarcinoma xenograft and FVB-2/N(neu) transgenic breast cancer mouse models, but weakly inhibited the growth of EGFR-overexpressing tumor xenografts. Tumor growth inhibition induced by a single dose of AST1306 in the SK-OV-3 xenograft model was accompanied by a rapid (within 2 h) and sustained (≥24 h) inhibition of both EGFR and ErbB2, consistent with an irreversible inhibition mechanism. Taken together, these results establish AST1306 as a selective, irreversible ErbB2 and EGFR inhibitor whose growth-inhibitory effects are more potent in ErbB2-overexpressing cells.",

We therefore studied the role of Candidate signalling pathways in order to understand the mechanisms involved in regulation of hBD-expression by C. albicans. We used the esophageal cell line OE21 and analysed the role of paracrine signals from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in an in vitro model of esophageal candidiasis.;Supernatants of C. albicans or indirect coculture with C. albicans induces upregulation of hBD-2 and hBD-3 expression. PMNs strongly amplifies C. albicans-mediated induction of hBDs. By EMSA we demonstrate that C. albicans activates NF-kappaB and AP-1 in OE21 cells. Inhibition of these pathways revealed that hBD-2 expression is synergistically regulated by both NF-kappaB and AP-1. In contrast hBD-3 expression is independent of NF-kappaB and relies solely on an EGFR/MAPK/AP-1-dependent pathway.;Our analysis of signal transduction events demonstrate a functional interaction of epithelial cells with PMNs in response to Candida infection involving divergent signalling events that differentially govern hBD-2 and hBD-3 expression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is the principal cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The use of targeted therapies, especially tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), in specific groups of patients has dramatically improved the prognosis of this disease, although inevitably some patients will develop resistance to these drugs during active treatment. The most common cancer-associated acquired mutation is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Thr790Met (T790M) mutation. During active treatment with targeted therapies, histopathological transformation to small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) can occur in 3-15% of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumors. By definition, SCLC is a high-grade tumor with specific histological and genetic characteristics. In the majority of cases, a good-quality hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is enough to establish a diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other neoplasia such as sarcomatoid carcinomas, large-cell carcinoma, basaloid squamous-cell carcinoma, chronic inflammation, malignant melanoma, metastatic carcinoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma. A loss of the tumor-suppressor protein retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) is found in 100% of human SCLC tumors; therefore, it has an essential role in tumorigenesis and tumor development. Other genetic pathways probably involved in the histopathological transformation include neurogenic locus notch homolog (NOTCH) and achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1). Histological transformation to SCLC can be suspected in NSCLC patients who clinically deteriorate during active treatment. Biopsy of any new lesion in this clinical setting is highly recommended to rule out a SCLC transformation. New studies are trying to assess this histological transformation by noninvasive measures such as measuring the concentration of serum neuron-specific enolase. ",

In this report we demonstrate that gefitinib loaded PLGA nanoparticles (GNPs), in comparison to gefitinib, exhibited higher anti-cancer activity on A549 lung carcinoma cells and A431 skin carcinoma cells. Increased inhibition of pEGFR in both the cell types explains its higher anti-cancer activity. Interestingly, gefitinib resistant, H1975 (T790M EGFR mutant) lung carcinoma cells was also found to be sensitive to GNPs. Our data shows that GNPs hyperacetylate histone H3 in these cells, either directly or indirectly, which may account for the augmented cell death. GNPs were proficient in activating histone acetyltransferases (p300/CBP), which in turn induces the expression of p21 and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, inhibition of histone acetyltransferases by garcinol results in alleviation of cell death caused by GNPs. In addition to this, nuclear intrusion of GNPs results in the inhibition of NO production in nucleus, possibly through nuclear EGFR, which might be responsible for preventing cell proliferation in resistant cells. To best of our knowledge, we provide first evidence that GNPs potentiate cell death by activating p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases.",

Furthermore, expression of EGFR has not provided a consistent predictive value for survival of breast cancer patients. Here, we analyzed 130 breast carcinomas via immunohistochemical analyses for the levels of nuclear and non-nuclear EGFR. We found 37.7% of the cohort immunostained positively for nuclear EGFR and 6.9% with high levels of expression. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test revealed a significant inverse correlation between high nuclear EGFR and overall survival (P = 0.009). Expression of nuclear EGFR correlated positively with increased levels of cyclin D1 and Ki-67, both are indicators for cell proliferation. In contrast, expression of non-nuclear EGFR did not significantly correlate with those of cyclin D1 and Ki-67 or the overall survival rate. In addition, we analyzed 37 oral squamous carcinomas for EGFR expression and found 24.3% of the cases to contain moderate/high levels of nuclear EGFR.

Stat5 activation has been primarily demonstrated in hematopoietic malignancies. Gene disruption studies suggest potentially distinct functions of the Stat5 isoforms, Stat5a and Stat5b, which are encoded by two genes closely linked on human chromosome 17. To determine the function of Stat5 in SCCHN growth control, we studied the expression and constitutive activation of Stat5a and Stat5b in normal and transformed human squamous epithelial cells. Increased constitutive activation of Stat5 was detected in transformed compared with normal squamous cells. Blockade of TGF-alpha or EGFR, abrogated Stat5 activation. Targeting of Stat5b using antisense oligonucleotides inhibited SCCHN growth. In addition, SCCHN cells stably transfected with dominant negative mutant Stat5b failed to proliferate in vitro. In contrast, targeting of Stat5a using either antisense or dominant negative strategies had no effect on cell growth.

Immunophenotype was correlated with histologic and clinical features. High-grade dysplasia (HGD) was associated with overexpression of HER1 (20.7% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.023), HER2 (5.3% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.187) and HER3 (47.4% vs. 9.4%, p<0.001) compared to low-grade dysplasia (LGD). There was a significant association of HER2 (20.0% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.022) and HER3 (80.0% vs. 40.4%, p = 0.023) overexpression in HGD lesions associated with foci of invasive carcinoma compared to those without invasive foci.

Elucidation of the key downstream-pathways that remain activated in the setting of EGFR blockade may reveal new therapeutic targets. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex would enhance the effects of EGFR blockade in HNSCC preclinical models. Treatment of HNSCC cell lines with the newly developed TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor OSI-027/ASP4876 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation with abrogation of phosphorylation of known downstream targets including phospho-AKT (Ser473), phospho-4E-BP1, phospho-p70s6K, and phospho-PRAS40. Furthermore, combined treatment with OSI-027 and erlotinib resulted in enhanced biochemical effects and synergistic growth inhibition in vitro. Treatment of mice bearing HNSCC xenografts with a combination of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved EGFR inhibitor cetuximab and OSI-027 demonstrated a significant reduction of tumor volumes compared with either treatment alone.

Although erbB2 has no known physiologic ligand, it can form complexes with other members of the family and undergo transactivation of its very potent kinase activity, thereby initiating downstream signaling and cell proliferation. ErbB2 is a frequent pathologic marker in ductal invasive breast carcinomas and is targeted by using a specific humanized monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin). The antibody is effective in only 20% to 50% of erbB2-positive tumors, and this resistance, as yet poorly understood, constitutes a major therapeutic challenge.;Magnetic microspheres coated with ligands or antibodies are widely used for separation of proteins and cells and allow localized, high intensity, and precisely timed stimulation of cells. We used EGF- and trastuzumab-covered paramagnetic microspheres, quantitative confocal laser scanning microscopy, and digital image processing to investigate the (trans)activation of and local signal propagation from erbB1 and erbB2 on trastuzumab sensitive and resistant carcinoma cell lines expressing these receptors at high levels.;On A431 cells expressing high levels of endogenous erbB1 and transfected erbB2-mYFP (A4-erbB2-mYFP F4 cell line), EGF-coupled-microspheres activated erbB1 and transactivated erbB2-mYFP. In two other cell lines with comparable erbB2 expression but lower levels of erbB1, EGF microspheres transactivated erbB2 less efficiently. Trastuzumab in solution activated erbB2 on A4-erbB2-mYFP and the trastuzumab sensitive SKBR-3 cells, but only negligibly on the resistant JIMT-1 cells that showed a 10 times higher K(d) for the antibody. Nevertheless, pronounced erbB2 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected after stimulation with trastuzumab-coupled microspheres in all cell lines, although transactivation of erbB1 was negligible. Receptor phosphorylation was restricted to the immediate proximity of the microspheres, i.e., receptor clusters external to these locations remained inactive.;ErbB1 ligand and erbB2 specific antibody attached to magnetic microspheres are efficient tools in assessing erbB activation, localized signal propagation, and erbB heterodimer formation. Trastuzumab coupled to microspheres is more efficient at accessing erbB2 and activating it than trastuzumab in solution.",

Among invasive and in situ carcinoma, EGFR expression was the most prevalent (in 29/32 and 8/11 cases, respectively) followed by ErbB2 (17/32 and 2/11) and ErbB4 (9/32 and 1/10), while ErbB3 was only detected in invasive tumours (12/32). Specific patterns included invasive tumours with expression of EGFR (8/32) or ErbB4 (1/32) alone, as well as different receptor combinations (EGFR+ErbB2, EGFR+ErbB4, EGFR+ErbB2+ErbB3, EGFR+ErbB2+ErbB4, and all four receptors). Simultaneous expression of three or four ErbB receptors correlated with tumour invasion (p=2.2x10(-4)) and localized in the intermediate epithelial cell layer of well and moderately differentiated tumours. No other significant correlation with clinico-pathological features was noticed. Some benign lesions and histologically normal mucosa adjacent to carcinomas showed weak immunostaining of EGFR (10/28), ErbB2 (4/28) or ErbB4 (3/28).

In the current study we explored the role of EGFR and its potential use as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer. First we analyzed 66 gastric cancer samples of Asian and Caucasian patients for the presence of EGFR mutations. No activating EGFR mutations were found and gefitinib alone was only weakly effective in gastric cancer cell lines. However, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of gefitinib indicating synergistic action. Whole genome expression profiling indicated significant regulation of 120 genes in the case of co-administration of gefitinib and ASA (32 induced, 88 repressed) in gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Further analyses indicated that several important signalling pathways were effectively inhibited by simultaneous exposure to gefitinib and ASA. Our findings indicate that although gastric cancer does not seem to harbour mutations which render the cancer cells constitutively susceptible to gefitinib, the co-administration of ASA can strengthen RTK inhibitor activity in adenocarcinoma cells by EGFR activation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Previous studies have shown that EGF can induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in murine fibroblasts following ErbB1 (EGF receptor) mutation or overexpression, but the cell signaling events linking EGF action with caveolin phosphorylation are not fully established. In this regard, we examined multiple human carcinoma cell lines that express various ErbB family members, including A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells and several squamous carcinoma cell lines. In all cases, EGF treatment induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in a time- and EGF dose-dependent manner, and immunoblotting analysis revealed that this phosphorylation occurred at tyrosine-14. The EGF-dependent phosphorylation of caveolin-1 was observed at low temperatures (4 degrees C) and was enhanced by caveolae-disrupting agents (cyclodextrin), suggesting that this EGF-dependent system is in a low temperature-stable arrangement that allows for their interaction under conditions where mobility in the membrane is altered. To further assess the events linking EGF action with caveolin phosphorylation, we evaluated the ligand specificity of these responses and their dependence on known effectors of EGF receptor function. We observed that EGF and HB-EGF, but not heregulin, promoted caveolin-1 phosphorylation in A431 cells, suggesting that these responses are linked to EGF receptor activation and not solely occurring via the activation of other endogenous ErbB family members. In addition, the EGF-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in A431 cells was blocked by the Src kinase antagonists PP1 and PP2, but not by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, or cytoskeleton-disrupting agents, such as cytochalasin D, colchicine, and nocadazole. Altogether, these data indicate that multiple human carcinoma cells exhibit an EGF receptor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and that this process is sensitive to Src family kinase inhibitors. These observations support a role for caveolin tyrosine phosphorylation in the profile of cellular responses by which Src potentiates cancer progression following EGF receptor overexpression.",

We recently revealed that GEP100, a guanine nucleotide exchanging factor, is responsible for the activation of Arf6 which induces invasion and metastasis. GEP100 associated directly with ligand-activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to be activated. Disruption of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is one of the major steps involved in acquisition of invasive phenotypes of most carcinomas. The EGFR-GEP100-Arf6 pathway not only activated matrix invasion activity but also perturbed E-cadherin function. GEP100 was found to be expressed in more than 80% of invasive ductal carcinomas. However, 60% of ductal carcinomas in situ were also positive for GEP100, in which GEP100 was preferentially coexpressed with EGFR in their malignant cases. Microenvionments have been highly implicated in the development of tumor malignancy. Our results reveal an aspect of the precise molecular mechanism of cancer invasion and metastasis, in which full invasiveness is not acquired just by alterations of cancer cells themselves, but their microenvironments may also play pivotal roles.",

MiR-145 is downregulated in several human malignancies, including lung cancer, but the responsible molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that restoration of hsa-miR-145 inhibits cancer cell growth in lung adenocarcinoma patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. This study showed that hsa-miR-145 targets EGFR and nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X-type motif 1 (NUDT1 or MTH1) in lung adenocarinoma cells. The mRNA expressions of EGFR and NUDT1 were significantly downregulated after miR-145 transfection in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our results demonstrated miR-145 in the negative regulation of EGFR and NUDT1 expressions at both mRNA and protein levels. Further analysis showed that miR-145 has the ability to inhibit cell proliferation on transfected lung adenocarcinoma cells over three time points (24, 48 and 72 hours). Upregulation of miR-145 appeared to be an important gene regulation mechanism for the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells and it correlated strongly with the downregulation of EGFR and NUDT1. Interestingly, our study revealed that the altered proliferation in lung cancer cells is not accompanied by changes in apoptosis. Our findings provided new insight into the complex regulating pathway comprising of miR-145, EGFR, NUDT1 and other unknown factors which function in cell proliferation but not in apoptosis. Understanding miR-145's targets and its regulating pathways may lead to new therapeutic strategies for lung adenocarcinoma.",

EFGR selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or antibodies have recently emerged as promising treatments for solid tumors, including HNSCC, though the response rate to these agents is low. p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein, is required for apoptosis induced by p53 and various chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we show that PUMA induction is correlated with EGFR-TKI sensitivity, and is mediated through the p53 family protein p73beta and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In some HNSCC cells, the gefitinib-induced degradation of oncogenic Delta Np63 seems to facilitate p73-mediated PUMA transcription. Inhibiting PUMA expression by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) impairs gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, PUMA or BH3 mimetics sensitize HNSCC cells to gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that PUMA induction through p73 represents a new mechanism of EGFR inhibitor-induced apoptosis, and provide potential ways for enhancing and predicting the sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapies in HNSCC.",

Correlations between molecular alterations and clinical outcome were also explored retrospectively for first-line chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI treatment.;Patients who had progressed during or after first-line chemotherapy were prospectively assigned to EGFR-TKI treatment as follows: (G1) EGFR mutation (n = 12); (G2) highly polysomic/amplified EGFR (n = 18); (G3) EGFR and/or pAKT positive (n = 41); (G4) adenocarcinoma/bronchoalveolar carcinoma and no smoking history (n = 15). G1 and G4 had the best and second-best overall response rate (25% and 20%, respectively), whereas the worst outcome was observed in G2 (ORR, 6%; p = 0.05). Disease control was highest in G1 and G4 (>50%) and lowest in G3 (<20%) (p = 0.02).

Multivariate analysis confirmed the impact of sex, smoking history, EGFR/KRAS mutation, and pAKT on outcomes and allowed us to derive an efficient predictive model.

Several mechanisms lead to the receptor's aberrant activation that is observed in cancer, including receptor overexpression, mutation, ligand-dependent receptor dimerization, and ligand-independent activation. Two classes of anti-EGFR agents are currently approved for the treatment of patients with cancer: cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed at the extracellular domain of the receptor, and gefitinib and erlotinib, oral, low-molecular-weight (MW), adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitors of the receptor's tyrosine kinase. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated activity in the therapy of advanced colorectal carcinoma and in a variety of epithelial tumor types, including head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The development of low MW, anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been focused until recently on NSCLC, although responses have been reported for other types of cancer. Erlotinib was the only agent approved based on demonstrating improved survival, which was observed in patients with advanced NSCLC who previously had been treated with chemotherapy. Recent major advances in the EGFR field include the discovery of EGFR somatic mutations in NSCLC that have important implications for biology, treatment, clinical trial design, and methods for mutation detection. Clinical and survival benefits with anti-EGFR agents have been demonstrated in additional tumor types such as head and neck and pancreatic carcinomas. New agents with clinical activity are entering the clinic and new combinatorial approaches with anti-EGFR agents are being explored. Major efforts are, belatedly, attempting to identify molecular markers that can predict patients more likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapy.",

EGFR status was analyzed in 16 different SCCHN cell lines by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing for activating mutations, by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and by Western blot analysis for RNA and protein expression. Using direct sequencing of PCR products from exons 18-23 of 9 SCCHN cell lines, we found a heterozygous EGFR mutation (EGFRmut) with a 2607Gright curved arrow A transition in exon 20 (G/A genotype). The 9 different cell lines that showed this mutation also showed higher sensitivity (lower IC50 values) to gefitinib than cell lines with wild-type EGFR (EGFRwt: G/G genotype) (p=0.016). EGFR protein levels correlated robustly (r=0.76) and significantly (p=0.0007) with EGFR mRNA levels and with IC50 values for gefitinib (r=0.65, p=0.0067).

Identification of specific molecular alterations, such as activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4/anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusions have led to significant therapeutic gains in patients with adenocarcinoma. However, meaningful therapeutic gains based on the molecular pathobiology of squamous cell lung cancer have not yet been realized. A comprehensive genomic characterization of 178 cases of squamous cell lung cancer has recently been reported. Squamous cell lung cancer appears to be characterized by a broader and more complex group of genomic alterations than adenocarcinoma. In this review, potentially targetable genes or pathways in squamous cell lung cancer are emphasized in relation to available therapeutic agents in development or active clinical trials. This organization of data will provide a framework for development for clinical investigation. Squamous cell lung cancer appears to be characterized by not only driver mutations in candidate genes but also gene copy number alterations resulting in tumor proliferation and survival. Better understanding of these genetic alterations and their use as therapeutic targets will require broad collaboration between industry, government, the cooperative groups, and academic institutions with the ultimate goal of rapid translation of scientific advancement to patient benefit.

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been proposed as a key modulator of cadherin-containing intercellular junctions, particularly in tumors that overexpress this tyrosine kinase. Here the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKI166 and EGFR blocking antibody C225, both of which are used clinically to treat head and neck cancers, were used to determine the effects of EGFR inhibition on intercellular junction assembly and adhesion in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. EGFR inhibition resulted in a transition from a fibroblastic morphology to a more epithelial phenotype in cells grown in low calcium; under these conditions cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is normally reduced, and desmosomes are absent. The accumulated levels of desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) and desmocollin 2 increased 1.7-2.0-fold, and both desmosomal cadherin and plaque components were recruited to cell-cell borders. This redistribution was paralleled by an increase in Dsg2 and desmoplakin in the Triton-insoluble cell fraction, suggesting that EGFR blockade promotes desmosome assembly. Importantly, E-cadherin expression and solubility were unchanged. Furthermore, PKI166 blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of Dsg2 and plakoglobin following epidermal growth factor stimulation, whereas no change in phosphorylation was detected for E-cadherin and beta-catenin. The increase in Dsg2 protein was in part due to the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-dependent proteolysis of this desmosomal cadherin. These morphological and biochemical changes were accompanied by an increase in intercellular adhesion based on functional assays at all calcium concentrations tested. Our results suggest that EGFR inhibition promotes desmosome assembly in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, resulting in increased cell-cell adhesion.",

In this work, a 200 nm fluorescent nanoparticle contrast agent was synthesized for targeted imaging of EGFR through a series of surface modifications to dye-encapsulated polystyrene particles. Amino-functionalized polystyrene particles were PEGylated using a heterobifunctional PEG linker. Subsequently, thiolated M225 antibodies were conjugated to maleimide functional groups on attached PEGs for EGFR targeting. In vitro binding studies using flow cytometry demonstrated specific binding of M225-PEG-NP to EGFR-expressing cells with minimal nonspecific binding in EGFR(-) cells.

Adsorbed formulations with unmodified M225 antibodies, M225 + PEG-NP, were synthesized using the same antibody feeds used in M225-PEG-NP synthesis to determine the contribution of adsorbed antibodies to EGFR targeting.

In addition, ErbB receptor family members are commonly amplified and overexpressed in various human neoplasms and tumor-derived cell lines, where it is believed that increased signalling as a result of receptor overexpression may play an important role in oncogenesis. Consequently, ErbB receptor family members are being investigated rigorously as potential biomarkers of cancer and as therapeutic targets in malignant tissues. Numerous studies now demonstrate the existence of \"soluble\" ErbB (sErbB) analogs in normal and cancerous tissues. These sErbB proteins embody the extracellular domain (ECD) of the receptor only; they are generated by either proteolytic cleavage or from truncated, alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts. Recently, we have identified an alternate transcript of the human c-erbB1 (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) proto-oncogene from placenta that encodes a sErbB1 protein of 60-kDa. This protein, p60 sErbB1, is glycosylated and secreted when expressed in transfected tissue culture cells in vitro. Although \"soluble\" receptor analogs may play important physiological roles in intercellular communication, tissue morphogenesis, tissue regeneration and repair, and embryogenesis by inhibiting or stimulating specific mitogenic and pattern forming signals, their mechanism of action has not been thoroughly elucidated. To further characterize sErbB1 expression in human tissues and cell lines and to better understand their role in carcinogenesis and normal development, we have generated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) toward specific peptide epitopes of ErbB1 extracellular subdomains III and IV. These antibody reagents are described here and should be useful experimental, preparative, analytical, diagnostic, and therapeutic reagents for the study of sErbB1 molecules in normal development and cancer.",

Recently, efforts have been made to develop novel 4-anilinoquinazoline and pyridopyrimidine derivatives to inhibit EGFR and ErbB2 kinases simultaneously. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a novel reversible dual inhibitor GW572016 compared with the selective EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) AG1478 and AG879 and their combination, using the human colon adenocarcinoma GEO mode. GEO cells depend on multiple ErbB receptors for aberrant growth. A synergistic effect on inhibition of cell proliferation associated with induction of apoptosis was observed from the combination of AG1478 and AG879. Compared with AG1478 or AG879, the single TKI compound GW572016 was a more potent inhibitor of GEO cell proliferation and was able to induce apoptosis at lower concentrations. Western blot analysis revealed that AG1478 and AG879 were unable to suppress both EGFR and ErbB2 activation as well as the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways as single agents. In contrast, GW572016 suppressed the activation of EGFR, ErbB2, MAPK, and AKT in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, in vivo studies showed that GW572016 treatment efficiently blocked GEO xenograft growth at a dose range of 30 to 200 mg/kg with a twice-daily schedule.

Since most cell types express more than one member of the ErbB family, it is difficult to distinguish the biological activities of different homo- and heterodimers. Here we describe a method for inducing homo- or heterodimerization of ErbB receptors by using synthetic ligands without interference from the endogenous receptors. ErbB receptor chimeras containing synthetic ligand binding domains (FK506-binding protein [FKBP] or FKBP-rapamycin-binding domain [FRB]) were homodimerized with the bivalent FKBP ligand AP1510 and heterodimerized with the bifunctional FKBP-FRB ligand rapamycin. AP1510 treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 homodimers and recruitment of Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins (Shc and Grb2). In addition, ErbB1 and ErbB2 homodimers activated downstream signaling pathways leading to Erk2 and Akt phosphorylation. However, only ErbB1 homodimers were internalized upon AP1510 stimulation, and only ErbB1 homodimers were able to associate with and induce phosphorylation of c-Cbl. Cells expressing AP1510-induced ErbB1 homodimers were able to associate with and induce phosphorylation of c-Cbl. Cells expressing AP1510-induced ErbB1 homodimers were able to form foci; however, cells expressing ErbB2 homodimers displayed a five- to sevenfold higher focus-forming ability. Using rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization we show that c-Cbl is unable to associate with ErbB1 in a ErbB1-ErbB2 heterodimer most likely because ErbB2 is unable to phosphorylate the c-Cbl binding site on ErbB1. Thus, we demonstrate that ErbB1 and ErbB2 homodimers differ in their abilities to transform fibroblasts and provide evidence for differential signaling by ErbB homodimers and heterodimers. These observations also validate the use of synthetic ligands to study the signaling and biological specificity of selected ErbB dimers in any cell type.",

Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), not otherwise specified (NOS) favouring SCC are usually not tested for the presence of EGFR mutations, and therefore may not receive EGFR TKI therapy. A bronchoscopic rebiopsy showed small nests of undifferentiated tumour cells with weak immunoreactivity of some tumour cells for CK5/6, p63 and no positivity of some tumour cells for thyroid transcription factor-1. These findings suggested a mixed squamous/glandular immunophenotype that has been missed at the initial biopsy. Our clinical case illustrates the problem of tumour heterogeneity encountered in small bronchoscopic biopsies and the difficulties of evaluating the histological subtype in poorly differentiated carcinomas. Initial bronchoscopy should be performed by an experienced pulmonologist who attempts to obtain sufficient material from different areas of the tumour. In the era of targeted therapy, a remote smoking history in a patient with NOS favouring SCC should also lead to EGFR mutation testing to allow highly effective therapy to be offered to mutation-positive patients.",

This is largely because the maintenance of primary cell cultures is difficult. However, being monoclonal, cell lines are not representative of the primary tumor because of the loss of tumor cell heterogeneity. We report a technique for primary culture of squamous cell carcinomas with maintenance of epithelial and stromal cell components without overgrowth of the fibroblast cells. Phenotypic markers for fibroblasts and squamous cells were present up to 45 days after initiation of culture, and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and involucrin in cultures paralleled that in the primary tumor. In vivo, tumor stromal elements are thought to play an important role in the support of epithelial cell growth. In the collagen gel system the preservation of the stromal cell component likely improves culture viability and growth. More importantly, this culture system allows the in vitro tumor to more accurately reflect the tumor from which it was derived, and it permits the study of primary squamous cell carcinomas under in vitro conditions.",

In normal breast EGFR was expressed in variable patterns in lobular, ductal, and myoepithelial cells. In fibroadenoma, EGFR was detectable in variable numbers of ductal and myoepithelial cells and in stromal fibroblasts. The myoepithelial compartment of 2 cystosarcomas phyllodes also expressed EGFR. Among the 197 carcinomas tested only 20.3% contained EGFR expressing tumour cells which represented a minority in 12.2%, the majority in 2.1%, and the entire neoplastic population in 6.1% of the cases. Again, non-neoplastic ductal remnants often contained EGFR positive myoepithelial and ductal cells whereas stromal fibroblasts expressed EGFR only occasionally. We conclude that in contrast to the normal state, EGFR-expression is a rather rare phenomenon in breast carcinoma cells, positively correlated with a declining grade of differentiation (p less than 0.025) and at least occasionally associated with squamous metaplasia within the tumour, that EGFR expression is not exclusively restricted to cells of the epithelial lineage, and that EGFR may have other functions not related to proliferation, since it is commonly detectable in myoepithelial cells.",

Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach in patients with advanced typical NSCLC such as adenocarcinoma, the potential clinical activity of these drugs in lung SC is still unknown. To investigate this point, we have analyzed the status of 4 EGFR pathways biomarkers in a series of lung SC. EGFR protein expression, EGFR gene copy number, EGFR mutational status and KRAS mutational status were assessed in a series of 22 consecutive cases of primary lung SC. EGFR protein overexpression was observed in all the cases. High level of polysomy (>or=4 copies of the gene in >40% of cells) was detected in 5 cases (23%). No EGFR mutation was detected. KRAS mutations were found in 8 patients (38%; Gly12Cys in 6 cases and Gly12Val in 2 cases). The consistent EGFR protein overexpression and the high rate of KRAS mutation may contribute to the poorer outcome of lung SC in comparison with typical NSCLC. The rare incidence of increased EGFR gene copy number, the lack of EGFR mutation and the high rate of KRAS mutation observed in our series also suggest that most patients with lung SC are not likely to benefit from anti-EGFR therapies.",

In order to further define the role of these RTKs, 56 human skin tissue samples of normal skin, BCC and SCC were studied by conventional and differential and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR). EGFR and HER3 were predominantly expressed in the BCCs and SCCs, while HER2 was ubiquitously expressed. HER4 was not expressed in any sample. Since in vitro studies have provided compelling evidence that heterodimer formation of these receptors are associated with different signal transduction processes, coexpression patterns might be decisive for the induction and maintenance of a malignant phenotype. These results confirm this concept: isolated HER2 expression and EGFR/HER2 were predominantly found in normal skin, while HER2/HER3 and the triple expression of EGFR/HER2/HER3 were seen more frequently in the BCCs and SCCs compared with normal skin (50% and 40% compared with 26%, respectively).

Actinic keratosis, which is also known as solar keratosis, develops in sun-exposed areas of the skin. These are often called 'premalignant lesions' and are said to represent early squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ, although debate over their classification continues. Anti-EGFR therapies have been approved for the treatment of several malignancies and are undergoing trials for others [1], including advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). However, a number of questions remain regarding the treatment of CSCC with anti-EGFR inhibitors. A lower number of CSCC tumours are EGFR positive in comparison to other types of tumours, such as head and neck SCC (HNSCC), and it has been suggested that patients should be selected on the basis of high tumour EGFR expression. However, there are reports of patients with tumours showing no EGFR-positive staining responding to anti-EGFR therapy. EGFR is an oncogenic driver in many tumours. Does it drive the transformation of actinic keratosis to a tumourigenic phenotype?

In a cellular model of oral-esophageal carcinogenesis, recapitulating the human disease, immortalization occurred independent of the activation of telomerase but through the recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). In this stepwise model, additional overexpression of EGFR led to in vitro transformation and activation of telomerase with homogeneous telomere elongation in already immortalized oral squamous epithelial cells (OKF6-D1_dnp53). More interestingly, EGFR overexpression activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. This strongly suggested a role for telomerase in tumor progression in addition to just elongating telomeres and inferring an immortalized state. Therefore, we sought to identify the regulatory mechanisms involved in this activation of telomerase and in vitro transformation induced by EGFR. In the present study we demonstrate that telomerase expression and activity are induced through both direct phosphorylation of hTERT by phospho-AKT as well as PI3K-dependent transcriptional regulation involving Hif1-alpha as a key transcription factor. Furthermore, EGFR overexpression enhanced cell cycle progression and proliferation via phosphorylation and translocation of p21. Whereas immortalization was induced by ALT, in vitro transformation was associated with telomerase activation, supporting an additional role for telomerase in tumor progression besides elongating telomeres.",

However, treatment resistance is an ever-growing problem and, therefore, new therapies are being investigated to overcome this hurdle. Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker that has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical models and has displayed clinical efficacy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, and activity in HNSCC and BC. Here, the preclinical and clinical development of afatinib in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, HNSCC and BC is described in the context of currently approved agents.",

Differences in intensity of EGFR immunostaining and the percentages of Ki67 and p53 positive cells between normal and tumor specimens were evaluated using the Student t-test, one-way ANOVA, and linear regression analysis.  Intensity of EGFR staining was weak and nuclear expression of Ki67 and p53 was scattered in all 9 control specimens. Expression of Ki67 and p53 but not EGFR was significantly higher in more advanced grades and TNM stages of colorectal adenocarcinoma than in normal controls.  The percentages of Ki67 and p53 stained tumor cells were significantly higher in moderately (Ki67: 60.3 ± 6.5, p53: 47.6 ± 3.8) and poorly (Ki67: 61.8 ± 5.3, p53: 55.1 ± 4.1) differentiated tumor cells than in well differentiated (Ki67: 40.8 ± 4.4, p53: 39.8 ± 4.2) tumor cells.

In 95 small-sized adenocarcinomas, the EGFR mutations were detected in 37 patients (38.9%), and no mutations were found in five AAHs. In small peripheral adenocarcinomas, EGFR mutations were found 47.1% of types A, B, or C adenocarcinomas; it was less frequent (16%) in Noguchi's types D, E or F adenocarcinomas. These results suggest that type D, F adenocarcinomas are not derived from the less malignant types A-C adenocarcinomas; rather, they have arisen de novo by distinct mechanisms. Although types A and B adenocarcinomas are almost 100% cured by surgery, some type C adenocarcinoma show lymph node metastasis and relapse.

In all cases of ACIS and the intramucosal adenocarcinomas, almost all cancer cells overexpressed p53, however the populations overexpressing ERBB2 and EGFR varied in different cases: in one ACIS, ERBB2 was coexpressed in all the cancer cells, in the other ACIS and one intramucosal adenocarcinoma, ERBB2 was overexpressed in about 50% and only 10% of the p53-positive cells respectively.

        "Doc_abstract":"We summarize significant changes in pathologic classification of lung cancer resulting from the 2011 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) lung adenocarcinoma classification. The classification was developed by an international core panel of experts representing IASLC, ATS, and ERS with oncologists/pulmonologists, pathologists, radiologists, molecular biologists, and thoracic surgeons. Because 70% of patients with lung cancer present with advanced stages, a new approach to small biopsies and cytology with specific terminology and criteria focused on the need for distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma from adenocarcinoma and on molecular testing for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement. Tumors previously classified as non-small-cell carcinoma, not otherwise specified, because of the lack of clear squamous or adenocarcinoma morphology should be classified further by using a limited immunohistochemical workup to preserve tissue for molecular testing. The terms \"bronchioloalveolar carcinoma\" and \"mixed subtype adenocarcinoma\" have been discontinued. For resected adenocarcinomas, new concepts of adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma define patients who, if they undergo complete resection, will have 100% disease-free survival. Invasive adenocarcinomas are now classified by predominant pattern after using comprehensive histologic subtyping with lepidic, acinar, papillary, and solid patterns; micropapillary is added as a new histologic subtype with poor prognosis. Former mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinomas are now called \"invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma.\" Because the lung cancer field is now rapidly evolving with new advances occurring on a frequent basis, particularly in the molecular arena, this classification provides a much needed standard for pathologic diagnosis not only for patient care but also for clinical trials and TNM classification.",

However, the relationship between clear cell carcinoma of the cervix (CCCC) and HPV is unclear. In this study, we sought to determine if HPV infection is associated with CCCC and to elucidate the signaling pathways involved.;We collected samples from 13 CCCC patients and collated the relevant clinicopathologic data. We then evaluated the presence of HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58 by broad-spectrum amplification by polymerase chain reaction and HPV types 39, 45, 51, 56, 59, and 68 by nested polymerase chain reaction assay that combines degenerate E6/E7 consensus primers and type-specific primers from extracted genomic DNA. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), HER2, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), p16, and p53. EGFR and HER2 gene amplification was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;Patients with stage IB CCCC had a better 3-year overall survival rate compared with those with advanced-stage cancer (100% vs 44%; P = 0.014). High-risk HPVs were not detected in any of the cases examined. EGFR immunostaining was observed in 9 (75%) of 12 patients, HER2 in 3 (25%) of 12, PTEN in 6 (50%) of 12, and phospho-AKT in 7 (58%) of 12, and phospho-mTOR in 6 (50%) of 12. EGFR amplification could not be detected, but HER2 amplification was identified in 1 of (12.5%) 8 cases.;Patients with stage I CCCC demonstrated good overall survival and rare recurrence. Clear cell carcinoma of the cervix is unrelated to high-risk HPV infection; hence, current vaccines will not prevent the incidence of CCCC. However, increased EGFR or HER2 expression or activation of AKT or mTOR was observed in all cases, indicating that inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or the AKT-mTOR pathway may be suitable treatment regimens for CCCC.",

In preclinical studies, ZD1839, alone and in combination with other agents, has demonstrated antitumour activity in a range of tumour types. Results from Phase I trials, in healthy volunteers and in patients with advanced disease, have shown that ZD1839 has excellent bioavailability and an acceptable tolerability profile. In these studies, ZD1839 has also shown promising clinical activity in patients with a variety of tumour types. Furthermore, Phase II studies confirmed clinically meaningful antitumour activity and have demonstrated symptom relief in the second- and third-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Phase III trials are currently evaluating ZD1839 in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin or paclitaxel/carboplatin as first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and an ongoing clinical trial programme is investigating other tumours (i.e., head and neck, prostate, colon and breast) and other combinations.

Among them, 67 patients had tissue and/or plasma EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutation detection in order to make an analysis on the relationship between EGFR mutation and the TKI's effect.;The disease control rate (DCR) was 56% in all the patients.

Mena expression level in primary tumors is correlated with metastasis in breast, cervical, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Cells expressing high Mena levels are part of the tumor microenvironment for metastasis (TMEM), an anatomical structure that is predictive for risk of breast cancer metastasis. Previously we have shown that forced expression of Mena adenocarcinoma cells enhances invasion and metastasis in xenograft mice. Whether Mena is required for tumor progression is still unknown. Here we report the effects of Mena deficiency on tumor progression, metastasis and on normal mammary gland development.;To investigate the role of Mena in tumor progression and metastasis, Mena deficient mice were intercrossed with mice carrying a transgene expressing the polyoma middle T oncoprotein, driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus. The progeny were investigated for the effects of Mena deficiency on tumor progression via staging of primary mammary tumors and by evaluation of morbidity. Stages of metastatic progression were investigated using an in vivo invasion assay, intravital multiphoton microscopy, circulating tumor cell burden, and lung metastases. Mammary gland development was studied in whole mount mammary glands of wild type and Mena deficient mice.;Mena deficiency decreased morbidity and metastatic dissemination. Loss of Mena increased mammary tumor latency but had no affect on mammary tumor burden or histologic progression to carcinoma. Elimination of Mena also significantly decreased epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced in vivo invasion, in vivo motility, intravasation and metastasis. Non-tumor bearing mice deficient for Mena also showed defects in mammary gland terminal end bud formation and branching.;Deficiency of Mena decreases metastasis by slowing tumor progression and reducing tumor cell invasion and intravasation. Mena deficiency during development causes defects in invasive processes involved in mammary gland development. These findings suggest that functional intervention targeting Mena in breast cancer patients may provide a valuable treatment option to delay tumor progression and decrease invasion and metastatic spread leading to an improved prognostic outcome.",

Expression profiling using microarrays, which was selectively validated and extended by immunophenotyping of Neu*-induced PIN and CAP, led to the identification of some novel biomarkers and also revealed increased expression of Egfr, Erbb3 and phosphorylated androgen receptor. In view of this information from our mouse model, which can be used to analyze further the role of Erbb signaling in prostatic tumorigenesis, we examined human prostate cancer tissue arrays by immunohistochemistry. Based on statistical analyses of the results, we propose the testable hypothesis that ERBB3, shown to be expressed in 86% of the human CAP cases that we examined, is the pivotal element of the Erbb pathway promoting tumorigenesis by heterodimerization with NEU or EGFR, while a NEU/EGFR dimer does not appear to play a significant role in CAP.",

These provide docking sites for downstream molecules and lead to the evasion of apoptosis, to proliferation, to invasion and to metastases, all of which are important for the cancer phenotype. Mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene was found in a subset of lung cancers in 2002. Lung cancers with an EGFR mutation are highly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib.

PDT is a promising and minimally invasive treatment modality that involves the interaction of a photosensitizer, molecular oxygen and light to destroy tumors. We demonstrated that EGFR inhibitors nimotuzumab and cetuximab exhibits anti-angiogenic properties by inhibiting the migration and invasion of oral cancer cell lines and human endothelial cells. The EGFR inhibitors also significantly reduced tube formation of endothelial cells. Chlorin e6-PDT in combination with nimotuzumab and cetuximab reduced cell proliferation in different oral cancer and endothelial cells. Furthermore, our in vivo studies showed that the combination therapy of PDT and nimotuzumab synergistically delayed tumor growth when compared with control and PDT treated tumors. Downregulation of EGFR, Ki-67 and CD31 was observed in the tumors treated with combination therapy. Analysis of the liver and kidney function markers showed no treatment related toxicity. In conclusion, PDT outcome of oral cancer can be improved when combined with EGFR inhibitor nimotuzumab. ",

In this study, we attempted to specifically evaluate the signaling pathway underlying HGF/Met induced EGFR ligand release in SSCs. The Met proto-oncogene encodes for a tyrosine kinase receptor which is often hyperactivated in human cancers. Met activation correlates with poor patient outcome. Several studies revealed a role of Met in receptor-crosstalk inducing either activation of other receptors, or inducing their resistance to targeted cancer treatments. In an epithelial tumor cell line screen we recently showed that the Met ligand HGF blocks the EGFR tyrosine kinase and at the same time activates transcriptional upregulation and accumulation in the supernatant of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin (Oncogene 32:3846-56, 2013). In the present work we describe the pathway responsible for the amphiregulin induction.;Amphiregulin is transcriptionally upregulated and is released into the supernatant. We show that Erk2 but not Erk1 mediates amphiregulin upregulation upon treatment with monocyte derived HGF. A siRNA knockdown of Erk2 completely abolishes amphiregulin release in squamous cell carcinomas.;These results identify Erk2 as the key downstream signal transducer between Met activation and EGFR ligand upregulation in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines derived from tongue, larynx and lung.",

Here we report the role of Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) in the regulation of NSCLC cell invasiveness and tumor metastasis. CIP4 was highly expressed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines and normal lung epithelial cell lines. Stable knockdown (KD) of CIP4 in lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells, expressing wild-type EGFR, led to increased EGFR levels on the cell surface and defects in sustained activation of Erk kinase in H1299 cells treated with EGF. CIP4 localized to leading edge projections in NSCLC cells, and CIP4 KD cells displayed defects in EGF-induced cell motility and invasion through extracellular matrix. This correlated with reduced expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in CIP4 KD cells compared with control. In xenograft assays, CIP4 silencing had no effect on tumor growth but resulted in significant defects in spontaneous metastases to the lungs from these subcutaneous tumors. This correlated with reduced expression of the Erk target gene Zeb1 and the Zeb1 target gene MMP-2 in CIP4 KD tumors compared with control. CIP4 also enhanced rates of metastasis to the liver and lungs in an intrasplenic experimental metastasis model. In human NSCLC tumor sections, CIP4 expression was elevated greater than or equal to twofold in 43% of adenocarcinomas and 32% of squamous carcinomas compared with adjacent normal lung tissues. Analysis of microarray data for NSCLC patients also revealed that high CIP4 transcript levels correlated with reduced overall survival. Together, these results identify CIP4 as a positive regulator of NSCLC metastasis and a potential poor prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma.",

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins have been linked to transformation and tumor progression.

We analyzed the role of Stat5a/b isoforms in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck using expression and activation studies in human tissues and in a xenograft model after selective targeting. In a xenograft model, blockade of Stat5b, but not Stat5a, using antisense oligonucleotides resulted in tumor growth inhibition and abrogation of Stat5 target genes in vivo. Blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor resulted in partial abrogation of Stat5 activation, thus linking epidermal growth factor receptor to Stat5 in vivo. In tissues from 33 individuals with head and neck cancer, Stat5 activation levels were correlated with progression to a malignant phenotype, where increased expression and phosphorylation of Stat5b were detected consistently in tumors compared with their epithelial counterparts. Thus, constitutive activation of Stat5b contributes to squamous cell tumorigenesis and may serve as a therapeutic target.",

This downregulation of EGFR is a complex and tightly regulated process. The functions of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 are also regulated by endocytosis to some extent, although the current knowledge of these processes is sparse. Impaired endocytic downregulation of signaling receptors is frequently associated with cancer, since it can lead to increased and uncontrolled receptor signaling.

The molecular events which induce laryngeal carcinogenesis are not yet known. Protoncogenes seem to be the target of the risk factors (cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, ionizing radiations and, not least HPV-DNA) that are commonly considered related to laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. New information on the role of alterations of oncogenes and/or their proteic products in laryngeal cancer will be useful in identifying new diagnostic and clinical therapeutical applications. The Authors investigated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) expression in 103 primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and 42 normal laryngeal tissue specimens in order to assess its clinical significance in primary laryngeal cancer. Significantly higher EGFR levels were found in cancer specimens compared with normal mucosa (p < 0.001). EGFR expression did not correlate with age, tumor localization, T classification, cervicallymphonode involvement or surgery, whereas in G3 tumors it was significantly higher than in G1-G2 (p < 0.05). Follow-up data were available for 74 cases: EGFR levels resulted significantly higher in patients who had a recurrence of the disease than those in recurrence-free patients (p < 0.05). The 24-month disease-free survival (DFS) was 58% for EGFR+ patients and 82% for EGFR-subjects. Multivariate analysis permitted identification of EGFR status and tumor localization as significant independent prognostic factors. Data reported here suggest that EGFR expression probably plays a role not only by regulating the growth of laryngeal cancer, but also by identifying a sub-set of laryngeal cancer patients at a higher degree of relapse risk and with an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, in this study p21-ras expression in 43 primary laryngeal cancers and in 7 normal laryngeal mucosa specimens was evaluated. Scattered p21 levels, expressed as optical density (O.D), were found in normal mucosa (median = 1.94) and in primary laryngeal tumours (median = 1.74). Higher p21 levels were found in neoplastic tissue than in normal laryngeal tissue (median = 2.54 vs median = 1.94; p = 0.023). The correlation between p21 ras protein and EGFR levels was also investigated. EGFR+ cases do not show any difference in p21 expression with respect to EGFR- cases (median = 1.52 O.D. vs median = 1.84). Our findings suggest that overexpression of p21 is associated with malignant phenotype in laryngeal cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor, has been found in many human epithelial neoplasms, including oral SCC. EGFR overexpression has been associated with advanced disease and a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether feline oral SCC express EGFR. Thirteen formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded biopsy samples from feline oral SCC were analysed for EGFR expression using immunohistochemistry. Nine of 13 tumours (69%) were positive for EGFR expression, suggesting that altered EGFR expression plays a role in feline oral SCC and provides a rationale for a potential clinical benefit using EGFR inhibitors in combination with conventional treatments.",

To test the hypothesis that inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway affects the antitumour effect of endocrine therapy, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib, and an oestrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, fulvestrant, were administered to human breast cancer cells. A total of five human breast cancer cell lines were used. The effects of single or combined treatments with gefitinib and/or fulvestrant on cell growth, cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analysed. Changes in the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, an antiapoptotic factor, Bcl-2, and a proapoptotic factor, Bax, were also investigated. All cell lines tested were sensitive to gefitinib (50% growth inhibitory concentration, 10-28.5 microM). Breast cancer cell lines with a high expression level of HER1 or HER2 were more sensitive to gefitinib than the others. Gefitinib induced a significant G1-S blockade in ER-positive KPL-3C cells. Gefitinib induced significant apoptosis in HER1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Gefitinib additively increased the antitumour effect of fulvestrant in all three ER-positive cell lines in a medium supplemented with 17beta-oestradiol. The combined treatment promoted cell cycle retardation in KPL-3C cells, which is associated with an upregulation of p21 by fulvestrant and gefitinib, respectively. Apoptosis was associated with downregulation of Bcl-2 by gefitinib in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggest an additive interaction between the EGFR-TKI gefitinib and the antioestrogen fulvestrant in ER-positive breast cancer cells.",

However, the effects of cetuximab on CSCs in the CRC chemotherapy remain unclear. Here, we studied the effects of cetuximab on the CSC-like cells in Fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated CRC cells. CSC-like cells were independently isolated from CRC cells using CD133, CD44 or EphB2-high as markers and confirmed by tumor sphere formation assay. We found that 5-FU increased the apoptotic death of CSC-like CRC cells. Co-application of cetuximab augmented the apoptotic death of CSC-like CRC cells by 5-FU, seemingly through inhibition of 5-FU-induced increases in cell autophagy in CSC-like CRC cells. Together, our data suggest that EGFR monoclonal antibody may sensitize CSC-like CRC cells to 5-FU-induced apoptosis by affecting autophagy.",

In the United States, select EGFRIs have been approved in certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal carcinoma, and advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Various cutaneous side effects of EGFRIs have been reported, including acneiform eruptions, chronic paronychia, xerosis, a seborrheic dermatitis-like eruption, changes in hair texture, and nonscarring alopecia. We present a 60-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer who developed a persistent generalized itchy eruption and progressive nonscarring alopecia shortly after initiation of erlotinib (Tarceva).

To explore a role for muscarinic receptor signaling in colon cancer metastasis, we used human H508 and HT29 colon cancer cells that coexpress epidermal growth factor (ERBB) and CHRM3 receptors. In a wound closure model, following 8-h incubation of H508 cells with 100 μM ACh we observed a threefold increase in cell migration indistinguishable from the actions of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Atropine blocked the actions of ACh but not of EGF. In SNU-C4 colon cancer cells that express ERBB but not CHRM, EGF caused a threefold increase in migration; ACh had no effect. ACh-induced cell migration was attenuated by chemical inhibitors of ERBB1 activation, by anti-ERBB1 antibody, and by inhibitors of ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Consistent with matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7)-mediated release of an ERBB1 ligand, heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HBEGF), ACh-induced migration was inhibited by an MMP inhibitor and by anti-MMP7 and -HBEGF antibodies. ACh-induced cell migration was blocked by inhibiting RhoA and ROCK, key proteins that interact with the actin cytoskeleton. ACh-induced RhoA activation was attenuated by agents that inhibit ERBB1, ERK, and PI3K activation. Collectively, these findings indicate that ACh-induced cell migration is mediated by MMP7-mediated release of HBEGF, an ERBB ligand that activates ERBB1 and downstream ERK and PI3K signaling. In a cell invasion model, ACh-induced HT29 cell invasion was blocked by atropine.

We demonstrate significant activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and its upstream activator Janus kinase (JAK)2, in high-grade ovarian carcinomas compared with normal ovaries and benign tumours. The association between STAT3 activation and migratory phenotype of ovarian cancer cells was investigated by EGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in OVCA 433 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines. Ligand activation of EGFR induced a fibroblast-like morphology and migratory phenotype, consistent with the upregulation of mesenchyme-associated N-cadherin, vimentin and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. This occurred concomitantly with activation of the downstream JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Both cell lines expressed interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), and treatment with EGF within 1 h resulted in a several-fold enhancement of mRNA expression of IL-6. Consistent with that, EGF treatment of both OVCA 433 and SKOV3 cell lines resulted in enhanced IL-6 production in the serum-free medium. Exogenous addition of IL-6 to OVCA 433 cells stimulated STAT3 activation and enhanced migration. Blocking antibodies against IL-6R inhibited IL-6 production and EGF- and IL-6-induced migration. Specific inhibition of STAT3 activation by JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490 blocked STAT3 phosphorylation, cell motility, induction of N-cadherin and vimentin expression and IL6 production. These data suggest that the activated status of STAT3 in high-grade ovarian carcinomas may occur directly through activation of EGFR or IL-6R or indirectly through induction of IL-6R signalling. Such activation of STAT3 suggests a rationale for a combination of anti-STAT3 and EGFR/IL-6R therapy to suppress the peritoneal spread of ovarian cancer.",

The present study examined the role of the iNOS signaling pathway in PGE2-mediated tumor invasiveness and proliferation in squamous cell carcinoma, A431, and SCC-9 cells. Cell invasion and proliferation promoted by PGE2 were blocked by iNOS silencing RNA or iNOS/guanylate cyclase (GC) pharmacological inhibition. Consistently, iNOS-GC pathway inhibitors blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was required to mediate PGE2 functions. In vivo, in A431 cells implanted in nude mice, GC inhibition also decreased the tumor proliferation index and ERK1/2 activation. PGE2 effects were confined to the selective stimulation of the EP2 receptor subtype, leading to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation via protein kinase A (PKA) and c-Src activation. EP2-mediated ERK1/2 activation and cell functions were abolished by inhibitors of PKA, c-Src, and EGFR, as well as by inhibiting iNOS pathway.

We investigated in the two tumor types, the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), principal signal transducers associated with cancer, as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme induced in malignant neoplasms. The clinical material includes tumor specimens from 61 patients with laryngeal cancer of glottic or supraglottic origin. Subsite groups were matched for gender, age and histological grade. Paraffin-section immunohistochemistry was performed, to detect the aforementioned molecules. Staining patterns were membranic and cytoplasmic for EGFR, purely cytoplasmic for COX-2, nuclear for RXRalpha and cytoplasmic, as well as nuclear, for NF-kappaB. Intense EGFR and RXRalpha expression was significantly associated with glottic tumor descent (P = 0.011 and 0.001, respectively). No significant relationship was established between neoplasm location and expressions of NF-kappaB, COX-2. Our results show that tumors emerging from the two laryngeal regions, are different with regard to their molecular constitution.

Activation of EGFR leads to autophosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase that initiates a cascade of downstream signaling pathways involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. EGFR is abnormally activated by various mechanisms like receptor overexpression, mutation, ligand-dependent receptor dimerization, ligand-independent activation and is associated with the development of variety of human cancers. EGFR inhibition is one of the key targets for cancer chemotherapy. Approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer led to tremendous development of novel EGFR inhibitors in the last decade.

However, under certain conditions, it may cause life-threatening infections, including Candida sepsis. We have recently shown that human β-defensins (hBDs) hBD-2 and hBD-3 are upregulated in Candida esophagitis and that this antifungal host response is distinctly regulated by NF-κB and MAPK/activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathways. Here, we show that C. albicans induces hBD-2 through an autocrine IL-1β loop and that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by endogenous transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) is a crucial event in the induction of hBD-3. To further dissect upstream signaling events, we investigated expression of the central sheddases for EGFR ligands ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the healthy and infected esophagus. Next, we used pharmaceutical inhibitors and small-interfering RNA-mediated knock down of ADAM10 and ADAM17 to reveal that ADAM17-induced shedding of TGF-α is a crucial step in the induction of hBD-3 expression in response to Candida infection. In conclusion, we describe for the first time an autocrine IL-1β loop responsible for the induction of hBD-2 expression and an ADAM17-TGF-α-EGFR-MAPK/AP-1 pathway leading to hBD-3 upregulation in the course of a Candida infection of the esophagus.",

Helicobacter pylori infection, dietary factors, lifestyle influences and various genetic aberrations have been shown to contribute to the development and progression of gastric cancer. Recent studies on the genomic landscape of gastric adenocarcinoma have identified several key signaling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) members, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR) members and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway components, that have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancers. However, clinical trials with compounds that target these molecules have failed to show a significant improvement in overall survival rates when supplemented with conventional therapies. Therefore, it is essential to identify effective prognostic and/or diagnostic biomarkers and develop molecular targeted therapies. The JAK/STAT cascade is a principal signal transduction pathway in cytokine and growth factor signaling, regulating various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling is a driving force in the pathogenesis of various solid cancers as well as hematopoietic malignancies. Hence, a large number of preclinical and clinical studies of drugs targeting this pathway are currently underway. Notably, aberrant JAK/STAT signaling has also been implicated in gastric cancers. In this review, we focus on the ongoing research on the JAK/STAT cascade in gastric carcinoma and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting JAK/STAT signaling for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

Hyperplasia is the first morphologic change that occurs in the bronchial epithelium during lung cancer development, followed by squamous metaplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive tumor. This study was designed to determine the molecular mechanisms that control bronchial epithelium hyperplasia. Using primary normal human tracheobronchial epithelial (NHTBE) cells cultured by using the 3-dimensional (3D) organotypic method, we found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, EGF, TGF-α, and amphiregulin induced hyperplasia, as determined by cell proliferation and multilayered epithelium formation. We also found that EGF induced increased cyclin D1 expression, which plays a critical role in bronchial hyperplasia; this overexpression was mediated by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway but not the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and U0126, a MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, completely inhibited EGF-induced hyperplasia. Furthermore, a promoter analysis revealed that the activator protein-1 transcription factor regulates EGF-induced cyclin D1 overexpression. Activator protein-1 depletion by using siRNA targeting its c-Jun component completely abrogated EGF-induced cyclin D1 expression. In conclusion, we showed that bronchial hyperplasia can be modeled in vitro by using primary NHTBE cells maintained in a 3D organotypic culture.

The transmembrane collagenase membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) is a major contributor to pericelluar proteolysis in the ovarian carcinoma microenvironment and is subjected to extensive posttranslational regulation. In the present study, the contribution of EGFR activation to control of MT1-MMP cell surface dynamics was investigated. Unstimulated ovarian cancer cells display caveolar colocalization of EGFR and MT1-MMP, whereas EGFR activation prompts internalization via distinct endocytic pathways. EGF treatment results in phosphorylation of the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic tail, and cells expressing a tyrosine mutated form of MT1-MMP (MT1-MMP-Y(573)F) exhibit defective MT1-MMP internalization. As a result of sustained cell surface MT1-MMP activity, a phenotypic epithelial-mesenchymal transition is observed, characterized by enhanced migration and collagen invasion, whereas growth within three-dimensional collagen gels is inhibited.

ZD1839 suppressed the growth of HNSCC cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Radiosensitivity of these HNSCC cell lines, assessed by a clonogenic survival assay, differed greatly and the expression of EGFR varied.

The expression of rat erbB2 was targeted to the basal layer of mouse epidermis with the bovine keratin 5 promoter. Overexpression of wild type rat erbB2 in the basal layer of epidermis led to alopecia, follicular hyperplasia and sebaceous gland enlargement as well as hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis. Spontaneous papillomas, some of which converted to squamous cell carcinomas, arose in homozygous erbB2 transgenic mice as early as 6 weeks of age with >90% incidence by 6 months. Analysis of several proliferation/differentiation markers indicated that erbB2 overexpression led to epidermal hyperproliferation and a possible delay in epidermal differentiation. Transgenic mice were also hypersensitive to the proliferative effects of the skin tumor promoter, 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and were more sensitive to two-stage carcinogenesis. Elevations in EGFr and erbB2 protein as well as erbB2:EGFr and erbB2:erbB3 heterodimers were observed in skin of the erbB2 transgenic mice.

The mutated EGFR proteins (EGFRs) are hyper-phosphorylated and refractory to receptor down-regulation. To address the discrepancy between hyper-phosphorylation and lack of down-regulation of mutant EGFRs, we have examined the expression of EGFR negative regulators in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. We found that NSCLC cell lines expressing mutant EGFRs often had low expression of various negative regulators for EGFR. Among them, tumor suppressor CD82 was up-regulated by wild type (WT) EGFR but down-regulated by mutant EGFRs. Reconstitution of CD82 exerted stronger suppressive effects on mutant EGFRs than on WT EGFR. Active exportation of CD82 through the exosome was one of the mechanisms involved in achieving the overall CD82 down-regulation in mutant EGFR-expressing lung cancer cell lines. Over-expression of mutant EGFR protein frequently occurred in the lung cancer tissues of mutant EGFR-transgenic mice and also associated with CD82 down-regulation. Immunoblot analyses on the tumor tissues from 23 lung adenocarcinoma patients (12 with WT EGFR, and 11 with mutant EGFRs) also identified significantly stronger down-regulation of CD82 in tumors with mutant EGFRs than WT. Our data indicate that CD82 down-regulation could be a critical step involved in the EGFR over-expression and the stronger tumorigenic activity triggered by EGFR mutations. Up-regulation of the CD82 level may become a promising new treatment strategy for lung adenocarcinoma. ",

Each mutation caused significant EGF-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, and allowed the receptor to promote Ba/F3 cell mitogenesis in the absence of EGF, arguing that these are oncogenic mutations. Active mutated receptors are present at the cell surface and are fully competent to bind EGF. Recent structural studies show that the inactive EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between its activation loop and alphaC helix.

On comparison of the CRC primary tumor and matched adjacent normal mucosa (ANM) tissue samples, the mRNA expression levels of ErbB3, but not ErbB1, were significantly increased in CRC tissue samples, compared with those in the ANM tissues. The expression levels of the ligands exhibited opposing trends to their corresponding receptors, including EGF, BTC, AREG, EREG and HB‑EGF, which were increased in the CRC tissues, whereas NRG1 and NGR2 were decreased in thee CRC tissues, compared with those in the AMN tissues. Subsequently, the present study investigated the frequency of K-ras mutations in the patients with CRC. The K‑ras mutations were found to be present in 36.8% (45/122) of the cases, however, no correlation was observed between K‑ras mutations and clinicopathological characteristics.

The expression levels of ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, BTC, AREG, EREG, NRG1 and NRG2 were significantly decreased in the mutant K‑ras cases, compared with those in the wild‑type K‑ras cases. These results suggested that the tumorigenesis of CRC with wild‑type K‑ras was mediated through, not only ErbB1, but also through the ErbB2 and ErbB3 pathways. Notably, although ErbB2 does not bind any ErbB ligands, ErbB2 may activate tumorigenesis via a heterodimer, rather than a homodimer.

EGFR overexpression was found in 51 % of the tumors (24/47); in particular, EGFR overexpression occurred in mucoepidermoid (seven out of seven) and salivary duct carcinomas (9/12). Although EGFR amplification was not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, increased copy number due to polysomy of chromosome 7, which houses EGFR, was observed in 4 of the 24 tumors with EGFR overexpression; this polysomy occurred most frequently in salivary duct carcinomas (three out of nine). HER2 overexpression was observed in 21 % (10/47) of all tumors; in these 10 tumors, HER2 gene amplification was found in seven cases. p-Akt was found in 51 % (24/47) of all tumors, most frequently in mucoepidermoid carcinomas (six out of seven). p-mTOR was found in 57 % of the latter (four out of seven). Consequently, different signaling cascades were found activated: (1) an EGFR/HER2(-Akt)-mTOR-dependent axis, with gene gains of HER2 and/or EGFR, activated in salivary duct carcinoma and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma; (2) an EGFR(-Akt)-mTOR-dependent pathway activated in mucoepidermoid carcinoma or acinic cell carcinoma, without HER2 or EGFR gene alterations; and (3) an Akt-dependent pathway without EGFR/HER2 activation in other types.

Additionally, SH3GL2 promoted apoptosis while decreasing cell proliferation. However, if ERK1/2 was inhibited by U0126, the apoptosis rate increased and proliferation decreased inversely.;SH3GL2 participates in the regulation of apoptosis through the MEK-ERK signal pathway by adjusting EGFR in the laryngeal carcinoma cell line Hep2.",

Tumorigenesis has been linked with macrophage-mediated chronic inflammation and diverse signalling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. The precise role of EGFR in HCC is unknown, and EGFR inhibitors have shown disappointing clinical results. Here we discover that EGFR is expressed in liver macrophages in both human HCC and in a mouse HCC model. Mice lacking EGFR in macrophages show impaired hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas mice lacking EGFR in hepatocytes unexpectedly develop more HCC owing to increased hepatocyte damage and compensatory proliferation. Mechanistically, following interleukin-1 stimulation, EGFR is required in liver macrophages to transcriptionally induce interleukin-6, which triggers hepatocyte proliferation and HCC. Importantly, the presence of EGFR-positive liver macrophages in HCC patients is associated with poor survival. This study demonstrates a tumour-promoting mechanism for EGFR in non-tumour cells, which could lead to more effective precision medicine strategies. ",

For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) it was found that activating mutations in the kinase domain of the receptor predicted a high response-rate to EGFR-specific kinase inhibitors. The goal of the present study was to investigate potential sequence changes of EGFR in HNSCC cells and to determine their possible role in tumor biology.;The whole EGFR coding sequence of eleven previously well-characterized HNSCC cell lines was determined by RT-PCR sequencing. The response of the cells to the kinase inhibitor AG1478 and the monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab was evaluated by cell cycle and Western blot analysis.;None of the cell lines exhibited EGFR mutations. However, 4 out of the 11 (36%) cell lines harboured the K497 polymorphism in the receptor. The R497 cell lines were more frequently (71%) derived from N(+) tumors than the K497 cell lines (25%), whereas the K497 cells, although not reaching significance, appeared on average to be more sensitive to inhibitor treatment. This effect was particularly pronounced in the AG1478-treated tumor cells and was associated with the level of extracellular-signal regulated kinase-1/2 phosphorylation which appeared more efficiently inhibited in the cell lines exhibiting the K497 EGFR polymorphism.;EGFR mutations are a rare event in HNSCC cell lines and, consistent with previous studies the EGFR codon 497 polymorphism could play a significant role in HNSCC disease and therapy response.",

In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, Stat3 activation is mediated by up-regulation of the autocrine ligand-receptor pair, tumor growth factor alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in cell growth and resistance to apoptosis. The initiating molecular event in Stat3 activation is recruitment to specific phosphotyrosine motifs within signaling complexes. Stat3 activation by the EGFR has been mapped to the COOH-terminal region of the EGFR between amino acid residues 1061 and 1123, which contains Y1068 and Y1086. However, it is not known if Stat3 binds directly to the EGFR or if either of these tyrosines is involved in this interaction. In this study, we demonstrated in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells that activation of Stat3 by EGFR was eliminated by mutation of all five EGFR tyrosines to phenylalanine and that activation was restored with return of two of the mutated tyrosine sites, Y1068 and Y1086, to wild-type. Stat3 was detected in the activated EGFR complex, and its presence within the complex was dependent on Y1068 and/or Y1086. Phosphododecapeptides spanning Y1068 and Y1086 were able to pull down Stat3 with Y1068 being more effective than Y1086 in this regard. Real-time mirror resonance affinity analysis revealed Stat3 bound to phosphododecapeptide Y1068 with a K(D) of 135 +/- 20 nM and to phosphododecapeptide Y1086 with a K(D) of 243 +/- 36 nM (P = 0.044), consistent with the results of the pull-down assays. The lower K(D) of Y1068 was completely attributable to slower dissociation of Stat3 bound to Y1068 versus Y1086. Each phosphododecapeptide was capable of destabilizing Stat3 homodimers in vitro. When delivered into squamous carcinoma cells, phosphopeptides spanning Y1068 and Y1086 were able to inhibit EGFR-stimulated Stat3 DNA binding activity and cell proliferation.",

The efficacy of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was retrospectively evaluated in patients with EGFR-mutated SQC. Further pathologic analyses were performed using immunohistochemistry.;Thirty-three of 249 patients with SQC (13.3%) had EGFR mutations, including exon 19 deletion (19 of 33 patients, 58%), L858R point mutation in exon 21 (12 of 33, 36%), and G719S point mutation in exon 18 (2 of 33, 6%). Twenty of these 33 patients received EGFR-TKI therapy, and five of these 20 responded to EGFR-TKIs with a response rate of 25.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7%-49.1%). The patients' median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 1.4 months (95% CI, 0.7-5.8 months) and 14.6 months (95% CI, 2.9-undeterminable months), respectively. Approximately one third of the EGFR-mutated SQC patients achieved progression-free survival for longer than 6 months. Some of these patients had high carcinoembryonic antigen levels or a history of never smoking, or were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1.;Although EGFR-TKIs seem to be generally less effective in EGFR-mutated SQC than in EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma, some EGFR-mutated SQC patients can obtain clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs. To better identify these patients, not only EGFR mutation status, but also clinical factors and pathologic findings should be taken into consideration.",

To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance in breast cancer, we used estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells as a model system. We generated cisplatin-resistant MCF-7 cells and determined the functional status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways by phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase and phospho-MAPK arrays. The cisplatin-resistant MCF-7 cells are characterized by increased EGFR phosphorylation, high levels of AKT1 kinase activity, and ERK1 phosphorylation. In contrast, the JNK and p38 MAPK modules of the MAPK signaling pathway were inactive. These conditions were associated with inactivation of the p53 pathway and increased BCL-2 expression. We investigated the expression of genes encoding the ligands for the ERBB signaling cascade and found a selective up-regulation of amphiregulin expression, which occurred at later stages of cisplatin resistance development. Amphiregulin is a specific ligand of the EGFR (ERBB1) and a potent mitogen for epithelial cells. After exposure to cisplatin, the resistant MCF-7 cells secreted amphiregulin protein over extended periods of time, and knockdown of amphiregulin expression by specific short interfering RNA resulted in a nearly complete reversion of the resistant phenotype. To demonstrate the generality and importance of our findings, we examined amphiregulin expression and cisplatin resistance in a variety of human breast cancer cell lines and found a highly significant correlation. In contrast, amphiregulin levels did not significantly correlate with cisplatin resistance in a panel of lung cancer cell lines.

Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin sections of 17 cases of oral epithelial dysplasia (ED), four cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS), and 20 cases of untreated primary SCC. The extracted DNA was subjected to competitive PCR to amplify EGFR gene. Amplification of the EGFR gene was observed in three cases (17%) of ED, one case of CIS and four cases (20%) of SCC. In cases showing EGFR gene amplification, the degree of amplification was low in ED and CIS cases, whereas it was extremely high in SCC cases.

However, the mechanisms through which clinically targeted pathways are activated during CRC progression have yet to be elucidated. Here, we used an integrative genomics approach to examine CRC progression. We used laser capture microdissection to isolate colonic crypt cells, differentiated surface epithelium, adenomas, carcinomas and metastases, and used gene expression profiling to identify pathways that were differentially expressed between the different cell types. We identified a number of potentially important transcriptional changes in developmental and oncogenic pathways, and noted a marked upregulation of EREG in primary and metastatic cancer cells. We confirmed this pattern of gene expression by in situ hybridization and observed staining consistent with autocrine expression in the tumor cells. Upregulation of EREG during the adenoma-carcinoma transition was associated with demethylation of two key sites within its promoter, and this was accompanied by an increase in the levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, as assessed by reverse-phase protein analysis. In CRC cell lines, we demonstrated that EREG demethylation led to its transcriptional upregulation, higher levels of EGFR phosphorylation, and sensitization to EGFR inhibitors. Low levels of EREG methylation in patients who received cetuximab as part of a phase II study were associated with high expression of the ligand and a favorable response to therapy. Conversely, high levels of promoter methylation and low levels of EREG expression were observed in tumors that progressed after treatment. We also noted an inverse correlation between EREG methylation and expression levels in several other cancers, including those of the head and neck, lung and bladder. Therefore, we propose that upregulation of EREG expression through promoter demethylation might be an important means of activating the EGFR pathway during the genesis of CRC and potentially other cancers.Oncogene advance online publication, 6 June 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.170.",

In this study we explored the possibility of retarding the growth of tumor xenografts by decorin gene delivery into the growing neoplastic tissues. We demonstrate that transient transgene expression of replication-deficient adenovirus-containing decorin causes a significant growth inhibition of colon and squamous carcinoma tumor xenografts. These cytostatic effects were achieved with relatively low viral titers and correlated with a reduced proliferative index and an attenuation of the EGFR phosphorylation in vivo.

EGFR has become a model protein for understanding the biology and endocytosis of related growth-factor receptors, and the mechanisms involved in its endocytosis and degradation have been scrutinized for several decades. Nevertheless, the details and principles of these processes are still poorly understood and often controversial. In particular, the literature describing how the ubiquitylation and recruitment of EGFR to clathrin-coated pits are connected is inconsistent and confusing. In this Opinion article, we discuss the impact of signaling motifs, kinase activity and ubiquitylation on clathrin-dependent endocytosis and lysosomal sorting of EGFR.

To determine the timing of increased TGF-alpha and EGFR protein expression in the development of head and neck cancer, we examined progressive mucosal dysplasias from three distinct and complimentary patient groups: (a) samples from patients with lesions demonstrating different degrees of dysplasia (n = 22) compared with mucosa samples from gender and age-matched controls (n = 8); (b) patients with lesions demonstrating different degrees of dysplasia at a single time point (n = 3); and (c) patients who progressed over several years to invasive cancer at the site of dysplasia (n = 7). Immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies specific for TGF-alpha and EGFR were used to detect protein expression in all specimens. Protein levels were further quantitated using a computerized image analysis system. In all three groups, we found that TGF-alpha protein levels were elevated in mild dysplasia compared with control normal mucosa and were not further modulated with increasing degrees of dysplasia. In contrast, EGFR levels were relatively low in mild dysplasia and increased with higher degrees of dysplasia. These findings indicate that up-regulation of TGF-alpha and EGFR are distinct events both chronologically and, possibly, mechanistically in the pathogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",

The emergence of inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptors, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) in the last decade has resulted in steady improvement in clinical outcomes for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. However, improvements in the survival of patients with squamous NSCLC have remained elusive, presenting an urgent need for understanding and investigating therapeutically relevant molecular targets, specifically in squamous NSCLC. Although anti-VEGF therapy has been studied in squamous NSCLC, progress has been slow, in part due to issues related to pulmonary hemorrhage. In addition to these safety concerns, several phase III trials that initially included patients with squamous NSCLC failed to demonstrate improved overall survival (primary endpoint) with the addition of antiangiogenic therapy to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. Angiogenesis is an established hallmark of tumor progression and metastasis, and the role of VEGF signaling in angiogenesis is well established. However, some studies suggest that, while inhibiting VEGF signaling may be beneficial, prolonged exposure to VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors may allow tumor cells to utilize alternative angiogenic mechanisms and become resistant. As a result, agents that target multiple angiogenic pathways simultaneously are also under evaluation. This review focuses on current and investigational antiangiogenic targets in squamous NSCLC, including VEGF/VEGFRs, fibroblast growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and angiopoietin. Additionally, clinical trials investigating VEGF- and multi-targeted antiangiogenic therapies are discussed. ",

However, inhibition of the catalytic activity of phospholipase C had no effect on EGFR-induced SCC cell mitogenesis. In response to the EGFR ligand epidermal growth factor (EGF), PLC-gamma1 was translocated not only to the plasma membrane but also to the nucleus.

In addition, 51.8% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors showed polysomy 7, 50% showed polysomy 11, and 40.4% showed polysomy 17. However, no polysomy was observed in peritumoral tissues. Her-2 amplification and polysomy 17 significantly correlated with poor prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (P = .008 and P = .005, respectively). Interestingly, only cleaved caspase-3 protein level significantly correlated with poor survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (P = .000). We also observed significant correlations of cleaved caspase-3 level with epidermal growth factor receptor, Her-2, and cyclin D1 protein levels and the molecular abnormalities of Her-2 and cyclin D1. Conclusively, cleaved caspase-3 level is an ideal biomarker to predict prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients and might be a better target for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treatment than epidermal growth factor receptor/Her-2 and cyclin D1.",

Recent studies indicate that the frequency of the L858R mutant form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-L858R) is higher in lung adenocarcinoma with MPE than in surgically resected specimens, suggesting that lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring this mutation tend to invade the adjacent pleural cavity. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between the EGFR-L858R mutation and cancer cell invasion ability and to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of MPE. We found that expression of EGFR-L858R in lung cancer cells resulted in up-regulation of the CXCR4 in association with increased cancer cell invasive ability and MPE formation. Ectopic expression of EGFR-L858R in lung cancer cells acted through activation of ERK signaling pathways to induce the expression of CXCR4. We also indicated that Inhibition of CXCR4 with small interfering RNA, neutralizing antibody, or receptor antagonist significantly suppressed the EGFR-L858R-dependent cell invasion. These results suggest that targeting the production of CXCR4 and blocking the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway might be effective strategies for treating NSCLCs harboring a specific type of EGFR mutation. ",

The proportion of apoptotic cells and cell cycle stages were analyzed by flow cytometry. C3H/He mice with SCCVII tumor heterografts were treated with antisense-EGFR-nanoparticles or RT alone, or with combinations of concomitant and sequential therapy.

When the SCCVII cells were pre-treated with 2 mug of antisense-EGFR nanoparticles for 24 h and X-irradiated (4 Gy), flow cytometry analysis revealed cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. Our results show that antisense EGFR nanoparticles enhance radiosensitivity by inhibition of EGFR-mediated mechanisms of radioresistance.

We consecutively analyzed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion genes using remnant tissue samples. Results A total of 109 patients were diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Of these, 70% were adenocarcinoma, 27% squamous cell carcinoma with NSCLC, and 3% were related to other types of lung cancer. EGFR mutations were detected in 23 cases (21.1%), KRAS mutations in 13 cases (11.9%), and ALK fusion genes in 5 cases (4.9%). The ALK fusion genes could not be analyzed in four cases because of insufficient tissue samples remaining after routine histochemistry and an EGFR/KRAS mutation analysis. We found that small biopsy samples from EBUS-TBNA were adequate for performing a triple gene analysis in 97 patients (96%). ALK fusion protein immunohistochemistry (IHC) was 100% consistent with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

In addition to ligand binding, mutual and cooperative interactions of EGFR with integrin cell adhesion receptors critically influence proper downstream signaling through a number of bridging adapter proteins. In the present study, we analyzed the role of two of these adapter proteins, called PINCH1 and Nck2, for cellular radioresistance in combination with EGFR-targeting using the monoclonal antibody cetuximab. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PINCH1 or Nck2 resulted in enhanced radiosensitivity of 3D grown human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines FaDu (head and neck) and A431 (epidermis) comparable with effects seen after cetuximab treatment. Combination of knockdown and cetuximab did not result in additive nor synergistic effects regarding clonogenic radiation survival. Modifications in MAPK, Akt and FAK phosphorylation occurred upon cetuximab treatment as well as PINCH1 or Nck2 depletion. We further found this tumor cell radiosensitization to be due to attenuated repair of DNA double strand breaks and altered Rad50 and Nbs1 expression but without changes in other DNA repair proteins such as ATM, DNA-PK and Mre11. Our data suggest that the adaptor proteins PINCH1 and Nck2 critically contribute to cellular radioresistance and proper EGFR signaling in 3D lrECM grown human squamous cell carcinoma cells.

A subset of 63 cancers was sequenced for EGFR exon 18 through 21 mutations.;EGFR expression was observed in 83.8% of clear cell carcinomas, in 68.2% of papillary carcinomas, in 75% of chromophobe carcinomas, and in 50% of oncocytomas. Within clear cell carcinomas, the expression level of EGFR was associated with high tumor grade (P < .0001), advanced pathologic tumor classification (P < .0001), and, to a lesser extent, lymph node status (P = .0326). FISH analysis revealed increased EGFR copy numbers (high polysomy) in 5.5% of tumors and amplification in 0.1% of tumors. EGFR copy number increases were associated with EGFR protein expression (P = .0015). Within clear cell carcinomas, EGFR copy number increases were associated with high tumor grade (P < .0001), advanced pathologic tumor classification (P = .0472), and lymph node status (P = .0065).

This might suggest that patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma, who also have tumors with EGFR-activating mutations, might represent a patient population who could benefit from gefitinib or erlotinib therapy. High-resolution melting amplicon analysis (HRMAA) is a recently described technique which can be used for screening tumor DNA isolated from paraffin blocks for tyrosine kinase-activating mutations. In this report we screened 24 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, either primary in the head and neck or secondarily involving the head and neck area, for activating mutations in EGFR exons 18, 19, 20, 21, and for HER2 exons 19 and 20. All cases were followed up by direct DNA sequencing. Two (8%) of the 24 cases were positive. One case was a maxillary sinus tumor which contained an exon 20-activating mutation (N771YinsG). Surprisingly, the other case was a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which invaded the head and neck area only secondarily. This tumor contained an exon 19-activating mutation (G729E). No HER2-activating mutations were found. The presence of a small number of squamous cell carcinomas in the head and neck area with EGFR-activating mutations suggests the existence of a population of patients who could derive benefit from gefitinib or erlotinib therapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"The overexpression and aberrant function of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands in several human carcinomas have provided a rationale for targeting this signaling network with novel treatment approaches. The epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) is a selective target for inhibiting cancer because it is activated in many tumor cells, yet is strictly controlled in normal cells. The EGFR-TK initiates diverse signal transduction pathways in tumor cells that have a profound effect on their biology. Activation of the EGFR-TK provides signals that drive dysregulated proliferation, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, and enhanced cell survival. Therefore, the EGFR-TK is a promising drug target for many types of solid tumors, and its inhibition has potential in both the treatment and prevention of these neoplasias. Based on the structure and function of the EGFR, two antireceptor therapeutic strategies have been developed. The first strategy uses humanized monoclonal antibodies generated against the receptor's ligand-binding, extracellular domain. These antibodies block binding of receptor-activating ligands and, in some cases, can induce receptor endocytosis and downregulation. The second approach uses small molecules that compete with adenosine triphosphate for binding to the receptor's kinase pocket, thus blocking receptor activation and the transduction of postreceptor signals. Early clinical studies suggest that both of these approaches, either alone or in combination with standard anticancer therapies, are well tolerated and can induce clinical responses and tumor stabilization in a variety of common carcinomas. ZD1839 (Iressa; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, DE) is the EGFR-TK inhibitor furthest along in clinical development, and it is currently being investigated in a variety of solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer.",

Treatment of mice with either 7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d]-pyrimidine lead scaffold (AEE788; an inhibitor of EGFR and VEGFR tyrosine kinase) or CPT-11 as single agents significantly inhibited the growth of cecal tumors (P < .01); this decrease was even more pronounced with AEE788 combined with CPT-11 (P < .001). AEE788 alone or combined with CPT-11 also inhibited the expression of pEGFR and pVEGFR on tumor-associated endothelial cells, significantly decreased vascularization and tumor cell proliferation, and increased the level of apoptosis in both tumor-associated endothelial cells and tumor cells.

Although most EGFR-mutant lung cancers are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and shrink in response to treatment, acquired resistance to TKI therapy is common. We demonstrate here that two EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, HCC827 and HCC4006, contain a subpopulation of cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and survive independent of activated EGFR. These EGFR-independent cancer cells, herein termed gefitinib-resistant (GR) cells, demonstrate higher levels of basal autophagy than their parental cells and thrive under hypoxic, reduced-serum conditions in vitro; this somewhat simulates the hypoxic environment common to cancerous tissues. We show that depletion of the essential autophagy gene, ATG5, by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, markedly reduces GR cell viability under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, we show a significant elevation in caspase activity in GR cells following knockdown of ATG5. These results suggest that GR cells can evade apoptosis and survive in hostile, hypoxic environments with constant autophagic flux. We also show the presence of autophagosomes in some cancer cells from patient samples, even in untreated EGFR-mutant lung cancer tissue samples. Together, our results indicate that autophagy inhibitors alone or in combination with EGFR TKIs may be an effective approach for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancers, where basal autophagy of some cancer cells is upregulated.

This effect is due, in part, to sustained MAPK-dependent Bcl-xL expression. Here, we report a second EGFR/MAPK-dependent signaling event that protects HaCaT cells against apoptosis incurred during forced suspension culture (anoikis). This pathway targets Bim, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member. Bim expression was functionally relevant to HaCaT cell survival as demonstrated by partial protection against anoikis provided by siRNA-induced Bim downregulation. Growth factor starvation of attached and suspended cells was associated with enhanced Bim expression whereas EGFR activation reduced Bim expression by inducing Bim phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. EGFR-dependent Bim phosphorylation required MAPK activation. Furthermore, PKC-delta activity contributed to both MEK/MAPK phosphorylation and Bim phosphorylation as demonstrated using both pharmacological inhibitors of PKC-delta and siRNA-mediated PKC-delta knockdown. In addition to HaCaT cells, EGFR activation supported survival and induced Bim phosphorylation in several squamous carcinoma cell lines in a strictly MAPK-dependent fashion. These results establish that EGFR activation attenuates susceptibility of immortalized and malignant keratinocytes to apoptosis by post-translational control of Bim-EL expression through a pathway requiring PKC-delta and MEK/MAPK activation.",

To investigate the mechanism underlying STAT3 deregulation in HNSCC, we examined the interplay of the STAT3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways using a panel of HNSCC cell lines. Although STAT3 was active in most HNSCC cell lines, only 3 of 10 HNSCC cell lines were moderately to strongly positive for activated EGFR. Even in the EGFR-positive cell lines, STAT3 activation was not dependent on EGFR activation, as STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation levels persisted after treatment with AG1478, a chemical inhibitor of EGFR activity. Furthermore, we found that conditioned medium harvested from HNSCC cells could induce STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in immortalized keratinocytes regardless of the status of EGFR signaling. In contrast, blocking the cytokine gp130 coreceptor abolished STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in HNSCC cells and that induced by the conditioned medium. Immunodepletion studies suggested interleukin 6 (IL6) as the major autocrine/paracrine factor for STAT3 activation, which coincided with high levels of secretion of IL6 into the culture medium by these cancer cells. Treatment with a specific inhibitor of Janus kinase, AG490, in HNSCC cells led to a reduction of active STAT3 and caused significant growth retardation and apoptosis. Thus, constitutive activation of STAT3 in HNSCC may use an autocrine/paracrine-activating loop mediated by IL6 and other cytokines acting through the gp130 receptor family, which may confer both proliferative and survival potential in this malignancy.",

Primary therapy is largely dictated by the anatomical origin of the cancer and whether distant disease is present. Many patients with localized disease are treated with chemoradiotherapy, either in the definitive or adjuvant setting, and those with metastatic disease are treated with palliative chemotherapy. The chemotherapy used in SCCHN can be toxic, whether given with radiation or alone. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in SCCHN and serves as a logical therapeutic target. EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) have higher activity in SCCHN than small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cetuximab, a widely studied EGFR MoAb, is FDA approved in the metastatic setting, as well as with radiation for locally advanced disease. Despite improvements in survival when cetuximab is incorporated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease, the prognosis of patients remains poor.

The description of the anilinoquinazoline class of potent and selective TK inhibitors led to several candidate drugs from this chemical class, for example gefitinib ('Iressa') and erlotinib ('Tarceva'), which are being evaluated in breast cancer patients. Rapid advances in cancer molecular genetics have identified numerous potential drug targets associated with abnormal control of cell division either downstream of the ErbBs, for example Ras and MEK, or in erbB-associated signalling networks, like Src kinase, which affect the tumour cell motility and invasiveness. Candidate drugs for several of these targets are currently being evaluated; for example, the prenylation inhibitor AZD3409, a mimetic of the CAAX box of K-Ras, inhibits protein farnesyl and geranylgeranyl tranferases and a novel, selective, orally active Src kinase inhibitor AZD0530 have entered Phase I clinical trials and may have utility in breast cancer therapy.",

Mutations and over-expression of the ErbB receptors have been implicated in a variety of human cancers. It is widely thought that the ErbB receptors are located in the plasma membrane, and that ligand binding to the monomeric form of the receptors induces its dimeric form for activation. However, it still remains controversial whether prior to ligand binding the receptors exist as monomers or dimers on the cell surface. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in the present study, we demonstrate that in the absence of bound ligand, all the ErbB family members have preformed, yet inactive, homo- and heterodimers on the cell surface, except for ErbB3 homodimers and heterodimers with cleavable ErbB4, which exist primarily in the nucleus. BiFC assays of the dimerization have also suggested that the ligand-independent dimerization of the ErbB receptors occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before newly synthesized receptor molecules reach the cell surface. Based on BiFC and mammalian two-hybrid assays, it is apparent that the intracellular domains of the receptors are responsible for the spontaneous dimer formation. These provide new insights into an understanding of transmembrane signal transduction mediated by the ErbB family members, and are relevant to the development of anti-cancer drugs.",

A better understanding of this association could inform improved strategies for preventing and treating this disease. We investigated the expression, regulation, and function of the transcriptional regulator SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (Sox9) in urothelial development, injury repair, and cancer. In mouse bladders, Sox9 levels were high during periods of prenatal urothelial development and diminished with maturation after birth. In adult urothelial cells, Sox9 was quiescent but was rapidly induced by a variety of injuries, including exposure to the carcinogen cyclophosphamide, culture with hydrogen peroxide, and osmotic stress. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) was required for Sox9 induction in urothelial injury and resulted from activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) by several Egfr ligands that were dramatically induced by injury. In UroCa cell lines, SOX9 expression was constitutively upregulated and could be suppressed by EGFR or ERK1/2 blockade. Gene knockdown showed a role for SOX9 in cell migration and invasion. Accordingly, SOX9 protein levels were preferentially induced in invasive human UroCa tissue samples (n = 84) compared with noninvasive cancers (n = 56) or benign adjacent urothelium (n = 49). These results identify a novel, potentially oncogenic signaling axis linking urothelial injury to UroCa. Inhibiting this axis is feasible through a variety of pharmacologic approaches and may have clinical utility.",

Although lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK fusions respond to treatment by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibition, respectively, squamous cell lung cancer currently lacks therapeutically exploitable genetic alterations. We conducted a systematic search in a set of 232 lung cancer specimens for genetic alterations that were therapeutically amenable and then performed high-resolution gene copy number analyses. We identified frequent and focal fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in squamous cell lung cancer (n = 155), but not in other lung cancer subtypes, and, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirmed the presence of FGFR1 amplifications in an independent cohort of squamous cell lung cancer samples (22% of cases). Using cell-based screening with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 in a large (n = 83) panel of lung cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that this compound inhibited growth and induced apoptosis specifically in those lung cancer cells carrying amplified FGFR1. We validated the FGFR1 dependence of FGFR1-amplified cell lines by FGFR1 knockdown and by ectopic expression of an FGFR1-resistant allele (FGFR1(V561M)), which rescued FGFR1-amplified cells from PD173074-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that inhibition of FGFR1 with a small molecule led to significant tumor shrinkage in vivo. Thus, focal FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer and associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in this cohort of patients.",

Therefore, we developed a high-throughput screen to identify proteins that regulate the levels of EGFR in squamous cell carcinoma.

One of these genes, Usp18, is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family. We found that knockdown of Usp18 in several cell lines reduced expression levels of EGFR by 50-80%, whereas the levels of other receptor tyrosine kinases remained unchanged. Overexpression of Usp18 elevated EGFR levels in a manner requiring the catalytic cysteine of Usp18. Analysis of metabolically radiolabeled cells showed that the rate of EGFR protein synthesis was reduced up to fourfold in the absence of Usp18. Interestingly, this dramatic reduction occurred despite no change in the levels of EGFR mRNA. This suggests that depletion of Usp18 inhibited EGFR mRNA translation. In fact, this inhibition required the presence of native 5' and 3' untranslated region sequences on EGFR mRNA. Together, our data provide evidence for the novel mechanism of EGFR regulation at the translational step of receptor synthesis.",

Adenocarcinoma rates decreased among males and only through 2005, after which they then rose during 2006 to 2010 among every racial/ethnic/sex group; rates for unspecified type declined. Male/female rate ratios declined among whites and blacks more than among other groups. Recent rates among young females were higher than among males for adenocarcinoma among all racial/ethnic groups and for other specified carcinomas among whites.;US lung cancer trends vary by sex, histologic type, racial/ethnic group, and age, reflecting historical cigarette smoking rates, duration, cessation, cigarette composition, and exposure to other carcinogens. Substantial excesses among males have diminished and higher rates of adenocarcinoma among young females have emerged as rates among males declined more rapidly. The recognition of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangements that occur primarily in adenocarcinomas are the primary basis for the molecular revolution that has transformed lung cancer diagnosis and treatment over the past decade, and these changes have affected recent type-specific trends.",

There was strong immunoreactivity for all gallbladder carcinoma and adenoma, the majority of common bile duct (n = 6; 86%) and ampullary (n = 6; 67%) carcinoma. In contrast, all cases of gallbladder dysplasia, the majority of cases of chronic cholecystitis (n = 7; 64%) and ampullary CIS (n = 2; 67%) had only weak to moderate immunoreactivity.

The purpose of this study was to determine the potential of ZD6474 in the control of established experimental lung metastasis and pleural effusions produced by human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. PC14PE6 (adenocarcinoma) and H226 (squamous cell carcinoma) cells express high levels of EGFR and only PC14PE6 cells overexpress VEGF. Neither ZD6474 nor the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib inhibit proliferation of PC14PE6 or H226 cells in vitro. Both PC14PE6 and H226 cells inoculated intravenously into nude mice induced multiple lung nodules after 5-7 weeks. In addition, PC14PE6 cells produced bloody pleural effusions. Daily oral treatment with ZD6474 did not reduce the number of lung nodules produced by PC14PE6 or H226 cells, but did reduce the lung weight and the size of lung nodules. ZD6474 also inhibited the production of pleural effusions by PC14PE6 cells. Histological analyses of lung lesions revealed that ZD6474 treatment inhibited activation of VEGFR-2 and reduced tumor vascularization and tumor cell proliferation. Therapeutic effects of ZD6474 were considered likely to be due to inhibition of VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase because gefitinib was inactive in this model. These results indicate that ZD6474, an inhibitor of VEGFR-2, may be useful in controlling the growth of established lung metastasis and pleural effusions by NSCLC.",

We confirmed that ErbB1 was activated in cultures of cerebellar granule cells exposed to inhibitors of axonal regeneration and that ErbB1 kinase inhibitors promoted neurite outgrowth under these conditions. In the presence of myelin, fibrinogen, CSPG and poly I:C ErbB1 -/- neurons grew longer neurites than neurons expressing ErbB1. Furthermore, inhibitors of ErbB1 kinase did not improve neurite outgrowth from ErbB1 -/- neurons, ruling out an off-target mechanism of action.

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients frequently results in tumor resistance to treatment. Autophagy is an emerging underlying resistance mechanism, however, the molecular autophagy machinery in HNSCC cells and potential biomarkers of patient response to EGFR-targeted therapy remain insufficiently characterized. Here we show that the EGFR blocking with cetuximab leads to varied autophagic responses, which modulate cancer cell susceptibility to EGFR inhibition. Inhibition of autophagy sensitizes HNSCC cells to EGFR blockade. Importantly, we identify a novel signaling hub centering on the NLRX1 (nucleotide-binding, lots of leucine-rich repeats-containing protein member X1)-TUFM (Tu translation elongation factor mitochondrial) protein complex, promoting autophagic flux. Defects in the expression of either NLRX1 or TUFM result in compromised autophagy when treated with EGFR inhibitors. As a previously undefined autophagy-promoting mechanism, we found that TUFM serves as a novel anchorage site, recruiting Beclin-1 to mitochondria, promoting its polyubiquitination, and interfering with its interaction with Rubicon. This protein complex is also essential for endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling induction, possibly as an additional mechanism to promote autophagy. Utilizing tumor specimens from a novel neoadjuvant clinical trial, we show that increased expression of the autophagy adaptor protein, SQSTM1/p62, is associated with poor response to cetuximab therapy. These findings expand our understanding of the components involved in HNSCC autophagy machinery that responds to EGFR inhibitors, and suggest potential combinatorial approaches to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

Tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice were used to assess the in vivo activity of panitumumab alone and combined with radiation. In vitro assays were performed to assess the effect of panitumumab on radiation-induced cell signaling, apoptosis, and DNA damage.;Panitumumab increased the radiosensitivity as measured by the clonogenic survival assay. Radiation-induced epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was inhibited by panitumumab. Panitumumab augmented radiation-induced DNA damage by 1.2-1.6-fold in each of the cell lines studied as assessed by residual gamma-H(2)AX foci after radiation. Radiation-induced apoptosis was increased 1.4-1.9-fold by panitumumab, as evidenced by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining and flow cytometry. In vivo, the combination therapy of panitumumab and radiation was superior to panitumumab or radiation alone in the H226 xenografts (p = 0.01) and showed a similar trend in the SCC-1483 xenografts (p = 0.08).

Epidermal growth factor receptor levels were estimated semiquantitatively. The percentage of strong/intermediate immunoreactivity of epidermal growth factor receptor in the syncytiotrophoblast was significantly higher in normal placental cases (98%) than in pathological conditions (P = .03), although strong/intermediate immunoreactivity in the syncytiotrophoblast was significantly lower in pathologic cases (35%) than controls (P < .001). No correlation (P > 0.01) was found between the trophoblast expression of EGFR and the weight of the newborn fetuses. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in the villous and extravillous cytotrophoblastic cells were significantly different between controls and preeclamptic cases (P > .05).;The development of pathologic pregnancies is possibly related to the differential expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in the syncytiotrophoblast.",

In some cervical squamous-cell carcinomas, an increased amount of proteins binding to the EGFR has been reported. In order to identify the mRNA of EGFR ligands (EGFRL), which might be overexpressed in cervical and endometrial cancers, we performed semi-quantitative reverse-transcription/polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) for all 6 EGFRL in RNA extracts of normal and malignant tissue samples of the human uterus. PCR products from RNA extracts of 83 patients were quantitated relative to the housekeeping gene and internal standard pyruvate dehydrogenase by analyzing the PCR kinetics of product synthesis. In extracts of normal cervix, the level of mRNA expression of the EGFRL was significantly higher than in endometrium. No significant difference was detected between normal cervix and cervical carcinomas. However, both in cervical and in endometrial cancers, mRNA expression was non-parametrically distributed and in some cervical cancers overexpression of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), amphiregulin or EGF was observed. In endometrial cancers, mRNA levels of all EGFRL were higher than in normal endometrium. This increase was significant (p < 0.005) for TGF-alpha and amphiregulin. Thus, TGF-alpha mRNA is overexpressed in approximately 10% of cervical cancers and in the majority of endometrial cancers. Since TGF-alpha anti-sense therapy might represent a future strategy in such cancers, we also determined the absolute level of TGF-alpha mRNA expression by quantitative PCR using a cloned standard.",

With respect to chemotherapy, target therapy is a more effective and less toxic treatments. The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), such as gefitinib or erlotinib, are one of the representatives of targeted therapy which have been widely used in first line, maintenance and 2nd/3rd line therapy among advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). But those with hepatic metastases may insensitive to EGFR-TKIs due to MET activation by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In our retrospective analysis, 164 lung adenocarcinoma patients with known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status who received the treatment of erlotinib as 2nd/3rd line setting were reviewed. The disease control rate (DCR) in patients without hepatic metastases group was higher than that in patients with hepatic metastases (66.1% vs 54.5%, p<0.001). In EGFR mutation-positive patients, median PFS was significantly longer in patients without hepatic metastases than that in those with hepatic metastases (9.9months 95% CI 7.74-12.06months vs. 7.9months 95% CI 5.88-9.92months; p=0.017).

We used a chemical genetic approach to generate a selective inhibitor of v-erbB [a transforming allele of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)] and interrogated inhibition in known downstream signaling pathways. On the basis of this analysis, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of v-erbB and phosphatidylinositol 3' (PI3) kinases could show improved potency. We, therefore, used two different cell lines to examine the effects of v-erbB or EGFR inhibitors, in combination with PI3 kinase inhibitors, in mouse models for EGFR-driven cancers. When treated with NaPP1, v-erbB-as1-transformed fibroblasts showed cell-cycle arrest and decreased activity of Akt kinase. Inhibitors of v-erbB-as1 and of PI3 kinase showed enhanced efficacy in treating established 3T3:v-erbB-as1 tumor allografts. We extended these results to the human glioma cell line U87:MG transduced with DeltaEGFR, a tumor-derived activated allele, treating tumor-bearing mice with vehicle, the EGFR inhibitor ZD1839, LY294002, or ZD1839 plus LY294002.

Two patterns of E-cadherin staining were observed in carcinomas, membrane reactivity and a diffuse cytoplasmic staining. A marked difference in expression of E-cadherin was observed between infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC) and infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC), the former showing complete loss of membrane staining, whereas 93% of IDC retained some level of expression. In IDC reactivity was not related to tumour grade but there was a significant association between reduced membrane levels of E-cadherin and the presence of lymph node metastasis, and a highly significant correlation between the presence of cytoplasmic E-cadherin and metastasis. A significant relationship was also demonstrated between reduced E-cadherin reactivity and expression of EGFR.

In addition, levels of EGF-R and transferrin receptor were also analyzed using an immunohistochemical approach, and the results compared with histological pattern and grading, and tumor staging. Increased expression of c-erb B-2 product was found in 32% of cases (7/22), a positive reaction being observed in 60% of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) Grade 3 lesions (3/5), 20% of Grade 2 TCCs (2/10) and 100% of adenocarcinomas (AC) (2/2), but in none of the cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Although no statistical correlation with staging was evident, TCCs or SCCs of high grade and stage often showed EGF-R-positive staining, whereas other well differentiated lesions and normal bladder epithelium were generally negative. Most cases of urinary bladder carcinoma were positive for the transferrin receptor, which was not detected in normal bladder. The results thus suggested that a positive reaction for c-erbB-2 product is correlated with TCC histological grading or AC morphology.

In a previous study on HNSCC cell lines, we found that epigalocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major biologically active component of green tea, inhibited activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and thereby inhibited EGFR-related downstream signaling pathways in HNSCC cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of EGCG on activation of the HER-2 receptor in human HNSCC and breast carcinoma cell lines that display constitutive activation of HER-2. Treatment of these cells with 10 or 30 microg of EGCG, respectively, doses that cause 50% inhibition of growth, markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of HER-2 in both cell lines. This was associated with inhibition of Stat3 activation, inhibition of c-fos and cyclin D1 promoter activity, and decreased cellular levels of the cyclin D1 and Bcl-XL proteins. Although these concentrations of EGCG are quite high, we found that concentrations of 0.1-1.0 microg/ml, which are in the range of plasma concentrations after administering a single oral dose of EGCG or a green tea extract, markedly enhanced the sensitivity of both types of cell lines to growth inhibition by Taxol, a drug frequently used in the treatment of breast carcinoma and HNSCC.

To reveal the genes differentially involved in telomerase activation mechanisms, we analyzed the relationship between common genetic aberrations and telomerase activity in 83 lung cancer tissues. We found that half (7 of 14) of lung adenocarcinomas with high telomerase activity showed neither TP53 nor RB1 deletion, while all squamous cell carcinomas and SCLCs with high telomerase activity showed loss of heterozygosity of at least one, if not both, of these suppressor oncogenes, indicating that these genetic aberrations are not required in activation of telomerase in a unique subset of adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, whereas the aberrations in TP53, RB1 and 1p34-pter were mutually related in 42 adenocarcinoma tissues, EGFR aberrations showed no relationship to either of them. These findings indicate that EGFR activating aberrations occur independently of other common genetic aberrations or telomerase activation mechanisms in lung adenocarcinoma, and that the distinct subset of lung adenocarcinoma with high telomerase activity without any common genetic aberrations may possibly have arisen from a telomerase-positive or telomerase-competent normal cell.",
