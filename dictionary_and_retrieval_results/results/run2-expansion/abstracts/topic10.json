We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous, chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in BRAF or c-kit have been reported in malignant melanoma. Because the activating mutations are dominant, it has been assumed that they are heterozygous in the affected tumors. To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing electropherograms on 43 BRAF mutation-positive and 3 c-kit mutation-positive malignant melanomas to determine the ratio of the normal to mutant allele. Of the 43 BRAF mutation-positive tumors, we classified 26 as presumptive heterozygous. Eight cases were indeterminate. Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the mutant allele. BRAF fluorescence in situ hybridization on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the mutant BRAF allele was due to amplification (2 cases) or chromosome 7 polysomy (7 cases). We have previously described the presence of the c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, in 2 of 100 malignant melanomas. In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the L576P mutation. Evaluation of the DNA sequencing electropherograms from all 3 cases of L576P mutation-positive melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal allele. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-kit on these 3 L576P mutation-positive tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the c-kit gene and the other 2 were present in a nonamplified diploid state. These results have important implications concerning the mechanism of oncogenesis in melanoma as well as in the response of the tumor to anticancer drugs targeting BRAF or c-kit.",

It was recently reported that gain-of-function KIT mutations and/or copy number increases are more common in mucosal and acral melanomas. Thus, we studied the frequency and pattern of KIT aberrations in mucosal and acral melanomas in Korea. We analyzed 97 patients who were pathologically confirmed with mucosal or acral melanoma between 1997 and 2010 at Samsung Medical Center. Of the 97 melanoma patients, 92 were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13, 17, and 18, BRAF and NRAS genes. KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative, real-time PCR. Of the 97 patients, 55 (56.7%) were mucosal, 40 (41.2%) were acral melanoma, and two were of unknown primary origin. Among seven cases with KIT mutation, five (60.0%) occurred in exon 11, one (20.0%) in exon 17, and one (20.0%) in exon 13. Point mutations were the most common, resulting in substitutions in exon 11 (K558R, T574A, L576P, and V559A), exon 13 (N655K), and exon 17 (N822K). A novel Thr574Ala (c.1720A>G) KIT mutation, which has not been reported in melanoma or other tumor types, was identified in one genital melanoma case. Of the 97 mucosal or acral melanoma specimens, 49 were tested for KIT gene copy number changes using quantitative PCR. Increased KIT copy number was identified in 15 patients: seven (40%) of 20 acral melanomas and eight (31%) of 26 mucosal melanomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in the BRAF kinase have been reported in a large number of cases of malignant melanoma. This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene. The presence of BRAF- and c-kit-activating mutations in malignant melanoma suggests new approaches to treating this disease involving specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove worthwhile and that mutation analysis by high-resolution melting analysis might help guide therapy.",

Most mutations are in exon 17, although exon 11-activating mutations have recently been described. For patients refractory to standard therapeutic protocols for seminoma, the presence of c-kit-activating mutations in some of these neoplasms might suggest an alternative therapy with KIT targeting drugs. We used the novel mutation scanning technique, high-resolution melting amplicon analysis, to screen a series of 22 testicular seminomas for c-kit-activating mutations. Four cases (18%) had exon 17-activating mutations and these included D816Y, D816V, Y823N and one case that contained both D816E and D820H. A single case (5%) had an exon 11-activating mutation. Interestingly, the exon 11-activating mutation was L576P, the same mutation that characterizes the rare c-kit mutation-positive cases of malignant melanoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for c-kit suggested that most seminomas are probably polysomic for c-kit and there was not a significant difference in c-kit FISH characteristics between the mutation-positive and mutation-negative cases. The use of high-resolution melting amplicon analysis as a screening technique will allow for the rapid identification of patients with testicular seminomas whose tumors contain c-kit-activating mutations.

Melanomas with demonstrated activating mutations in KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

PDGFRA mutational status in ocular melanoma has not been determined. Seventy-five ocular melanomas (53 choroidal, 6 iris, 11 ciliary body, and 5 conjuctival) were selected from the files of the Department of Ophthalmology. High-resolution melting curve analysis and sequencing were performed to detect mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18. Results of mutational analysis were correlated with anatomical site and KIT (CD117) immunohistochemistry. Eight of 75 (11%) ocular melanomas contained mutations in either the KIT or PDGFRA gene. Five of 53 (9%) choroidal melanomas were associated with mutations (KIT exon 11=3; KIT exon 17=1; PDGFRA intron 18=1). Two of six (33%) iris melanomas and a single (9%) ciliary body melanoma harbored KIT exon 11 mutations. No mutations were identified in conjunctival melanomas. The distribution of KIT and PDGFRA mutations by ocular melanoma anatomical site did not reach statistical significance (P=0.393) CD117 positivity was not predictive of KIT mutational status as only 6 of 58 (10%) CD177-positive tumors harbored KIT mutations. In addition, a KIT exon 17 mutation was identified in one CD117-negative tumor. KIT and PDGFRA mutations do occur in ocular melanomas at a frequency (11%) that is similar to acral and mucosal melanomas.

In general, conventional cytotoxic agents alone or in combination with immunologic drugs have limited clinical benefit. Advances in molecular analytic techniques have helped researchers discover genetic aberrations in KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase, in nearly 40% of patients with mucosal melanoma. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that hot-spot mutations, mostly substitutions in exons 11 and 13, result in constitutive activation of KIT and its downstream signal transduction pathways, such as the MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. KIT inhibitors, most notably imatinib, have shown promising clinical activity in KIT-mutant advanced melanoma, including mucosal melanoma, with clinical response rates exceeding 35% in patients with hot-spot mutations in exon 11 or 13 and/or a high mutant/wild-type allelic ratio. However, the duration of disease control is rather short in general, and treatment with KIT inhibitors as single agents is not optimal. Well-designed mechanistic studies aimed at assessing molecular differences between various KIT mutations or other aberrations and mechanisms of resistance are urgently needed to improve KIT-targeting therapy for melanoma. In addition, with availability of checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD-1 antibodies, immunotherapies using those inhibitors alone or in combinations of such immunotherapies with KIT inhibitors may lead to more effective therapeutic regimens.

In melanomas arising on mucosal, acral, and chronically sun-damaged skin, activating KIT mutations have been identified as oncogenic drivers and potent therapeutic targets. Through an initial whole-genome screen for aberrant promoter methylation in melanoma, we identified the KIT promoter as a target for hypermethylation in 43/110 melanoma cell lines, and in 3/12 primary and 11/29 metastatic cutaneous melanomas. Methylation density at the KIT promoter correlated inversely with promoter activity in vitro and in vivo, and the expression of KIT was restored after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Hypermethylation of KIT showed no direct or inverse correlations with well-documented melanoma drivers. Growth of melanoma cells in the presence of SCF led to reduced KIT expression and increased methylation density at the KIT promoter, suggesting that SCF may exert a selection pressure for the loss of KIT. The frequent loss of KIT in cutaneous melanoma by promoter hypermethylation suggests that distinct KIT signaling pathways have opposing roles in the pathogenesis of melanoma subtypes. ",

However, the relationship between KIT and melanoma histology remains uncharacterized, and its role in melanoma pathogenesis unknown.

Cases were analyzed for KIT protein expression relative to histologic variables: subtype, sun damage, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, melanoma in situ, vertical growth phase (VGP), location, and hyperpigmentation. Twenty-eight cases demonstrated 3+ membranous staining. Univariate analysis revealed 5 significant variables: sun damage (inverse, P = 0.015), tumor location (trunk>extremities>head and neck, P = 0.005), subtype (epithelioid>spindle, mixed>desmoplastic, P < 0.001), VGP (inverse, P = 0.024), and hyperpigmentation [22/26 (85% hyperpigmented cases) and 6/44 (14% nonhyperpigmented cases), P < 0.001]. Upon multivariate analysis, only hyperpigmentation and VGP remained statistically significant (P = 0.002, P = 0.019). Mutational analyses for KIT exons 9 and 11, and BRAF were performed on cases with 3+ labeling. Two of 27 of cases contained mutations in KIT exon 11, whereas only 1 case contained a V600E BRAF mutation, suggesting that KIT and BRAF mutations may be redundant events. Although KIT mutations were uncommon overall, pigmentation in conjunction with immunohistochemistry and nodular growth phase raised their frequency to 2 (40%) of 5 cases. We expand the context of KIT aberrations to involve areas other than acral and mucosal sites and demonstrate an inverse relationship between KIT abnormalities and sun damage.

The role of c-KIT signaling in melanoma has been controversial; although c-KIT activity is critical to melanocyte development, its expression tends to be lost in most melanomas. Some reports have even shown that the re-expression of c-KIT induces apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. The recent publication of work showing the presence of activating c-KIT mutations in acral and mucosal melanomas, as well as melanomas arising on skin with chronic sun damage, has renewed interest in c-KIT signaling in melanoma. Recent work from our own laboratory has further identified melanomas with constitutive c-KIT signaling activity resulting from c-KIT receptor overexpression. Although the initial clinical trials of the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib mesylate in melanoma were negative, some dramatic responses have been seen in patients with very high c-KIT expression and/or documented activating mutations, fostering the belief that focused studies in patients selected on the basis of c-KIT mutational status will yield more encouraging results.

Although 31 of the 44 original RET-transgenic mice died of rapidly growing melanoma within 12 months after birth, only 8 of the 44 Wv/Wv-RET-transgenic mice developed slowly growing melanocytic tumors with a greatly prolonged mean tumor-free period, 2 of which died of melanoma at a late stage. Even Wv/+-RET-transgenic mice had a clearly prolonged tumor-free period and definitely reduced frequency (6 of 61) of tumor death within 12 months after birth. Melanin production in the skin of these mice was not strongly impaired, suggesting that c-Kit affects the development of melanomas in these mice with only minor effects in melanin production. c-Kit expression in skin soon after birth was promoted in RET-transgenic mice, and c-Kit was expressed at high levels at the benign but not malignant stage of the tumor. A single injection of anti-c-Kit antibody (ACK2) into RET-transgenic mice soon after birth caused a surprisingly long-lasting suppression of development of melanoma, greatly prolonging the tumor-free period, and none of the 28 ACK2-treated RET-transgenic mice died from tumors at 12 months of age.

We evaluated the anti-tumor activity and safety of nilotinib, a KIT inhibitor, in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT alterations, either mutations or amplifications.;This study was open-label, single center, prospective phase II clinical trial. Between October 2009 and April 2011, 11 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT gene mutations or KIT gene amplifications were enrolled in the first stage of phase II study and nilotinib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoint was response rate and secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).;Of 11 patients, 9 patients were evaluable for treatment response. Of 9 patients, three patients had KIT mutations in exon 11, Leu576Pro, Val559Ala and Lys558Arg; and 6 patients had KIT amplifications > 50 copies compared to control DNA. Two patients achieved partial response (22.2%) and 5 patients achieved stable disease (55.6%). In two patients who responded to nilotinib, both had KIT mutations and showed durable response for 8.4 months and 10.0+ months. Of note, one patient with KIT amplification had stable disease with response for 6 months. A decrease in tumor size from baseline was observed in four patients (44.4%). Nilotinib 800 mg/d was very well tolerated with grade 1 nausea and grade 1 dry-eye being the most common adverse events.;We have decided to publish the preliminary results because anti-tumor activity of nilotinib was promising in KIT mutated patients. Although our results are preliminary, nilotinib had very favorable toxicity profile with durable response in metastatic melanoma patients with KIT mutations. The anti-tumor activity of nilotinib in melanoma patients with KIT amplification is yet to be determined in future studies. Currently, phase II nilotinib trial is ongoing in Korea as multi-center study.",

Indeed, metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis with a median survival time of 8-9 months and an estimated 3-year survival rate of less than 15%. Recent advances in our understanding of the genetic profile of melanoma cells and the molecular factors that drive malignant transformation have resulted in the identification of numerous new therapeutic targets. KIT is an established therapeutic target in cancers with activating mutations of KIT, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and considerable efficacy has been achieved with various small molecule inhibitors of KIT including imatinib mesylate. Nilotinib is an inhibitor of ligand-induced PDGFRα and PDFGRβ kinase activity and autophosphorylation of constitutively activated KIT harboring exon 13 or exon 11 mutations (IC50 values of 0.2 and 0.027 μmol/L, respectively), with efficacy comparable to that of imatinib.

By sequencing exons and intron borders, 36 SNPs and one indel were identified. Of 10 coding SNPs, three were non-synonymous mutations, likely to affect the protein conformation. A promising variant, located in exon 19 (p.Val870Ala), was genotyped in a MeLiM × Duroc cross, and an association analysis was conducted on several melanoma-related traits.

(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 42409-42418). We have shown that stem cell factor (SCF) is involved in the proliferation of normal uveal melanocytes and that c-Kit is expressed in 75% of primary uveal melanomas. This suggests that the acquisition of autonomous growth during melanoma progression may involve the SCF/c-Kit axis. We used six human uveal melanoma tumor-derived cell lines and normal uveal melanocytes to characterize the SCF/c-Kit system and to assess its specific role in transformation. We investigated the possible roles of activating mutations in c-KIT, the overexpression of this gene, and ligand-dependent c-Kit overactivation in uveal melanoma cell tumorigenesis. Four cell lines (92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31) expressed both SCF and c-Kit, and none harbored the c-KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 that have been shown to induce SCF-independent c-Kit activation. Melanoma cell proliferation was strongly inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of c-Kit in these cells, despite the presence of (V599E)B-Raf in SP6.5 and TP31 cells. We characterized the signaling pathways involved in SCF/c-Kit-mediated cell growth and survival in normal and tumoral melanocytes and found that constitutive ERK1/2 activation played a key role in both the SCF/c-Kit autocrine loop and the gain of function of (V599E)B-Raf for melanoma cell proliferation and transformation.

We show that PI3K is a major regulator of MAPK activation in response to c-Kit activity and the dominant effector of c-Kit-driven melanocyte proliferation and melanoma survival. Nevertheless, inhibition of the PI3K pathway in c-Kit mutant melanoma cells did not replicate the apoptotic efficacy of the c-Kit inhibitor, imatinib mesylate. Instead, the simultaneous suppression of the PI3K and MAPK pathways promoted a strong synergistic apoptotic effect. These data indicate that MAPK functions as a redundant survival signal that reinforces the PI3K cascade in c-Kit mutant melanoma. Thus, the concurrent inhibition of PI3K and MAPK signalling is required to suppress oncogenic c-Kit activity and may provide an effective therapeutic strategy in c-Kit mutant melanomas. ",

In a multivariate analysis, patients with melanomas in the nasal cavity had a significantly better overall survival than those with tumours in the paranasal sinuses (P=0.027).;Our findings show that KIT and BRAF mutations, which are accessible for present targeted therapies, are only rarely present in SNMMs, whereas NRAS mutations seem to be relatively more frequent. The data show that majority of SNMMs harbour alterations in genes other than KIT, NRAS and BRAF.",

Mutations in the KIT gene occur in 10-22% of mucosal melanomas. Tumor response to imatinib mesylate has been reported in about half of the patients with tumors harboring KIT mutations. Responses are almost exclusively restricted to tumors with mutations in KIT exon 9 or 11. We report a case of a patient with a sinonasal mucosal melanoma with a novel exon 8 mutation (C443S) who had marked initial response to imatinib. Somatic exon 8 KIT mutations have not been previously reported in mucosal melanoma or in other human solid tumors; however, such mutations have been reported in canine and feline mast cell tumors. Protein transcripts from exon 8 play an important role in the structural and functional integrity of the extracellular domain of KIT. In preclinical studies, a mutation in exon 8 led to autophosphorylation, independent of KIT ligand, and constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase. This biology may explain the successful application of imatinib in animals with tumors harboring exon 8 KIT mutations and in our patient with mucosal melanoma. This report expands the population of patients with melanoma who might benefit from imatinib to those with somatic exon 8 KIT mutations. Such mutations should be looked for in patients with mucosal melanoma.",

Among the paracrine growth factors involved in skin homeostasis, the KGF/FGF7 secreted by dermal fibroblasts promotes the epidermal proliferation and differentiation as well as the release from keratinocytes of other paracrine mediators. To evaluate the possible role played by KGF in affecting the behavior of different subtypes of melanoma carrying activating mutations or overexpression of the SCF receptor c-KIT, we used human melanoma cell lines, characterized by different expression levels of c-KIT and opposing responsivity to SCF, and HaCaT keratinocytes. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay and ELISA test on KGF-treated keratinocytes showed enhanced expression and secretion of SCF in response to KGF and dependent on functional KGF receptor. Immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical analysis showed, in one of the selected melanoma cell models, SCF-dependent c-KIT activation induced by stimulation with the culture supernatants collected from KGF-treated keratinocytes. In keratinocyte-melanoma cocultures stained for the Ki67 proliferation marker, incubation with KGF induced enhanced growth not only of the keratinocytes but also of the melanoma cells, which could be blocked by the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib, demonstrating the establishment of a KGF-induced paracrine signaling network owing to the coexpression of biologically active SCF released from keratinocytes and functional c-KIT on melanoma cells.",

We investigated KIT expression in a group of patients with early-stage malignant melanoma. Primary tumour specimens obtained from 261 radically resected patients with stage I and II malignant melanoma were examined for KIT expression. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were stained with the polyclonal rabbit anti-human anti-KIT antibody (Dako Cytomation Inc., Carpenteria, California, USA). Patients were classified into four groups according to the level of expression (0%, <30%, 30-60% and >60%). Univariate and multivariate analyses examining the impact of KIT expression, Breslow thickness, Clark level and microscopic ulceration on disease-free survival were performed. Within the population of 261 patients with early-stage melanoma with 62 recurrences during a follow-up of 64 months, KIT expression was found in 144 cases (55%). KIT was expressed in more than 60% of cells in 20 patients (8%), in 30-60% of cells in 64 patients (24%) and in less than 30% of cells in 60 patients (23%). KIT expression was not found in 117 patients (45%). In univariate analyses, the influence of KIT expression on disease-free survival was not proven (P=0.4956; log-rank test). Increasing Breslow thickness, a higher Clark level, the presence of microscopic ulceration and a higher stage were significantly associated with a shorter disease-free survival (P<0.0001; log-rank test in all cases). In multivariate analysis, Breslow thickness, stage and KIT expression were significant negative prognostic factors for a shorter disease-free survival (P<0.0001, P=0.0028, P=0.0488, respectively; stepwise Cox regression model). It can be concluded that KIT is expressed in more than one-half of early-stage malignant melanoma. KIT may serve as an additive prognostic factor to Breslow thickness and stage within the tested population. The therapeutic impact of KIT expression in malignant melanoma is uncertain.

We studied the prevalence of overexpression of HER-2/neu and c-Kit in 202 patients with malignant melanoma to evaluate a possible prognostic value of these molecular targets in malignant melanoma. METHODS: Overexpression of HER-2/neu and c-Kit was evaluated using immunohistochemical assays in 202 archival tissue specimens. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2001, 202 subjects (109 males; 54% and 93 females; 46%) with malignant melanoma were studied with a mean age of 57 years (age range: 15-101 years). The most common histologic type was amelanotic melanoma (n = 62; 30.7%) followed by superficial spreading melanoma (n = 54; 26.7%). The depth of penetration of melanoma (Breslow thickness, pT Stage) ranged from 0.4 mm (stage pT1) to 8.0 mm (stage pT4A). Mean thickness was 2.6 mm (stage pT3A). The ECOG performance scores ranged from 0 to 3. Only 2 patients (0.9%) revealed HER-2/neu overexpression, whereas 46 (22.8%) revealed c-Kit overexpression. Multivariate analysis performed did not show a significant difference in survival between c-Kit positive and negative groups (p = 0.36). Interestingly, not only was c-Kit more likely to be overexpressed in the superficial spreading type, a preliminary association between the presence or absence of c-Kit overexpression and the existence of another second primary tumor was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our large study indicate that the HER-2/neu onco-protein neither has a role in melanogenesis nor is a potential target for clinical trials with monoclonal antibody therapy. This indicates there is no role for its testing in patients with malignant melanoma. Although c-Kit, expressed preferentially in the superficial spreading type, may not have prognostic value, it does have significant therapeutic implications as a molecular target warranting further investigation.",

We identified 3 patients (9.1%) with lichen sclerosus associated with melanoma in situ, although no lichen sclerosus was found in the areas of invasive melanoma. No patient had vulvar nevi. We identified a) Breslow's depth, b) an absence of any of the pathological risk factors, such as satellitosis, in-transit metastasis, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and dermal mitosis, c) removal of inguino-femoral lymph nodes, d) lateral margin of >1 cm, and e) c-KIT expression as valuable prognostic predictors for disease-free survival.

Here, we describe a genetic variant in the 3' UTR of the KIT oncogene that correlates with a greater than fourfold increased risk of acral melanoma. This KIT variant results in a mismatch in the seed region of a miR-221 complementary site and reporter data suggests that this mismatch can result in increased expression of the KIT oncogene.

The most frequent sites of origin of noncutaneous melanoma are the eye and mucosal surfaces. Although noncutaneous melanomas are an uncommon group of cancers (representing less than 10% of all melanomas) a greater understanding of their genetic and molecular abnormalites is being translated into novel treatment strategies. These developments are important because there is currently no effective systemic therapy for noncutaneous melanoma. Significant attention has been focused on the role of c-kit (KIT, CD117), a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. In vitro and ex vivo evidence suggests that c-kit is frequently expressed/over expressed/mutated in noncutaneous melanoma. Anti-tumour effects with c-kit inhibitors are seen in pre-clinical models. A variety of multitargeted kinase inhibitors which have activity against c-kit are currently in early phase clinical trials in metastatic ocular, mucosal and acral melanoma.

A significant negative correlation between AP-2 expression level and tumor thickness was found. Moreover, AP-2 expression was positively associated with E-cadherin and c-kit expression. In contrast, there was a significant negative association between AP-2 and p21 expression levels. These findings suggest that p21 is independent of AP-2 transactivator function during the latest phases of melanoma progression. Finally, AP-2, c-kit, E-cadherin, and p21 expression levels did not show to be able to distinguish between dysplastic nevi and nevi without dysplasia.

In normal skin, SCF was mainly observed in endothelial cells of blood vessels but not frequently in basal melanocytes, whereas c-KIT was predominantly localised in tissue mast cells. In benign neoplastic melanocytes (common melanocytic naevi), localisation of SCF and c-KIT was complementary: SCF was mostly found in dermal naevus cells while c-KIT was revealed in epidermal naevus cells, although the expression of the latter antigen was not frequent. Malignant melanoma cells showed less frequent expression of these antigens than those in benign lesions. Of five cultured melanoma cell lines, SCF was observed in only one, and c-KIT was not found in any melanoma cells.

Melanomas with BRAF mutations tend to be located in areas of intermittent sun exposure, whereas melanomas with KIT mutations mostly appear in acral areas, the mucosas, and areas of chronic sun exposure. Sorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, has a cytostatic effect on most melanomas with mutations affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and is also capable of triggering apoptosis in a small subgroup of these melanomas. By inhibiting KIT, imatinib has a cytostatic and cytotoxic effect on melanomas with KIT mutations, and probably has the same effect on another subgroup of melanomas with other as yet imperfectly understood KIT mutations.

To date, limited genetic analyses confirmed KIT mutations as a recurrent genetic event similar to other mucosal melanomas, occurring in up to 30% of anorectal melanomas. Importantly, a subset of tumors harboring activating KIT mutations have been found to respond to c-Kit inhibitor-based therapy, with improved patient survival at advanced tumor stages. We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas. These included variants in canonical MAPK pathway effectors rarely observed in cutaneous melanomas (including an HRAS mutation, as well as a BRAF mutation resulting in duplication of threonine 599), and recurrent mutations in the tumor suppressor NF1 in 20% of cases, which represented the second-most frequently mutated gene after KIT in our series. Furthermore, we identify SF3B1 mutations as a recurrent genetic event in mucosal melanomas. Our findings provide an insight into the genetic diversity of anorectal melanomas, and suggest significant potential for alternative targeted therapeutics in addition to c-Kit inhibitors for this melanoma subtype.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 14 October 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.179.",

In a parallel fashion, the field of melanoma is shifting with the utilization of targeted therapy to treat BRAF-mutated melanoma. We reviewed published literature in PubMed on GIST and melanoma, with a focus on both past and current clinical trials. The data presented centers on imatinib, vemurafenib, and most recently dabrafenib, targeting KIT and BRAF mutations and their outcomes in GIST and melanoma. The BRAF(V600E) melanoma mutation, like the KIT exon 11 mutation in GIST, has the highest response to therapy. High response rates with inhibition of KIT in GIST have not been recapitulated in KIT-mutated melanoma. Median time to resistance to targeted agents occurs in ~7 months with BRAF inhibitors and 2 years for imatinib in GIST. In GIST, the development of secondary mutations leads to resistance; however, there have been no similar gatekeeper mutations found in melanoma. Although surgery remains an important component of the treatment of early GIST and melanoma, surgeons will need to continue to define the thresholds and timing for operation in the setting of metastatic disease with improved targeted therapies. Combination treatment strategies may result in more successful clinical outcomes in the management of melanoma in the future. ",

Recently, the better results in melanoma treatment were obtained with the mutation-specific inhibitors that have been developed for clinical use and target only patients with particular tumor genotypes. The aim of the study was to characterize the spectrum of \"driver\" mutations in melanoma subtypes from 137 patients with skin melanoma and 14 patients with mucosal melanoma. In total 151 melanoma cases, the frequency of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS mutations was 55.0, 10.6, 4.0, 0.7, and 0.7%, respectively. BRAF mutations were found in 69% of cutaneous melanoma without UV exposure and in 43% of cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (p=0.045), rarely in acral and mucosal melanomas. Most of melanomas containing BRAF mutations, V600E (92%) and V600K (6.0%) were potentially sensitive to inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib. NRAS mutations were more common in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (26.0%), in acral and mucosal melanomas; the dominant mutations being Q61R/K/L (87.5%). KIT mutations were found in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (8.7%) and mucosal one (28.6%), but not in acral melanoma. Most of KIT mutations were identified in exon 11; these tumors being sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This is the first monitoring of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS hotspot mutations in different subtypes of melanoma for Russian population. On the base of data obtained, one can suppose that at the molecular level melanomas are heterogeneous tumors that should be tested for \"driver\" mutations in the each case for evaluation of the potential sensitivity to target therapy.

Mutations in murine c-kit that reduce the receptor tyrosine kinase activity cause deficiencies in the migration and proliferation of melanoblasts, hematopoietic stem cells, and primordial germ cells. We therefore investigated whether c-Kit regulates normal human melanocyte proliferation and plays a role in melanomas. We show that normal human melanocytes respond to mast cell growth factor (MGF), the Kit-ligand that stimulates phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in c-Kit and induces sequential phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in several other proteins. One of the phosphorylated intermediates in the signal transduction pathway was identified as an early response kinase (mitogen-activated protein [MAP] kinase). Dephosphorylation of a prominent 180-kDa protein suggests that MGF also activates a phosphotyrosine phosphatase. In contrast, MGF did not induce proliferation, the cascade of protein phosphorylations, or MAP kinase activation in the majority of cells cultured from primary nodular and metastatic melanomas that grow independently of exogenous factors. In the five out of eight human melanoma lines expressing c-kit mRNAs, c-Kit was not constitutively activated. Therefore, although c-Kit-kinase is a potent growth regulator of normal human melanocytes, its activity is not positively associated with malignant transformation.",

We collected 170 melanocytic lesions, including 106 cutaneous MM from acral melanoma (AM) and nonacral melanoma (NAM) sites, 24 dysplastic nevi, and 40 common melanocytic nevi.

Mutation in exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 of KIT gene in genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction sequencing was also analyzed. Immunostaining scores for c-kit were found to be statistically higher in Dysplastic Nevi than in common melanocytic nevi and MM. In addition, cytoplasmic c-kit staining was significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with AM but not in those with NAM. Twenty-nine cases of MM (including 9 NAM and 20 AM) are analyzed for mutation in exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 of KIT gene in genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction sequencing, and no genetic mutation is found.

Observed inverse correlation of the c-kit and mir-221 expression in various melanocytic cells pointed to its involvement in regulation of cKit in melanoma. Moreover, a series of functional assays demonstrated that mir-221 could directly inhibit cKit, p27(Kip1) and, possibly, other pivotal proteins in melanoma.

The transmembrane c-kit protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is crucial in melanocytic homeostasis and, when mutated, is associated with tumor development in those cells. In human studies, its expression is generally detected in melanocytomas and primary malignant melanomas, being lost with tumor progression and metastasis. In this study, we aimed to analyze c-kit expression in canine cutaneous melanocytic tumors and its association with tumor behavior, in order to investigate the dog's potential in comparative pathology and c-kit's potential in the diagnosis of these tumors. The expression of c-kit was evaluated immunohistochemically in 39 canine cutaneous melanocytic tumors and scored in terms of the labeling location, extension, and intensity. The labeling location was essentially cytoplasmic, and the labeling extension and intensity were generally higher in melanocytomas (83.3% diffuse-labeled cells) than those in malignant melanomas (22.2% negative-labeled cells). The differences found in the labeling extension were statistically significant (P < 0.001). There was no association between c-kit immunoexpression in malignant melanomas and the clinicopathological criteria, except between the labeling intensity and the degree of intralesional pigmentation (P = 0.048). Our results for labeling extension are in agreement with similar human studies, reinforcing the dog's potential as a model organism for investigation in this type of cancer. In addition, the loss of c-kit expression in malignant melanomas might be a criterion of tumor aggressiveness, indicating that this receptor may be useful in the diagnosis of these tumors.",

The preclinical and clinical data regarding BRAF inhibition is reviewed. Other potential targets in these pathways are also discussed. Preclinical data have recently emerged, suggesting that the following subsets of patients have a lower frequency of BRAF mutations: acral, mucosal and cutaneous melanomas with chronic sun-induced damage. These lesions have a higher frequency of KIT mutations. However, cutaneous melanomas without chronic sun damage have a higher frequency of BRAF mutations and are not noted to have KIT mutations. It is possible that the appropriate subset of patients may respond differently to available targeted therapies and clinical trials are in development to assess the utility of KIT inhibition in these patients.",

In order to explore the prognostic significance of these molecules in melanoma, total SCF, SCF splice variants and c-Kit expression were studied in normal skin melanocytes and in 11 different melanoma cell lines, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nine of the 11 melanoma cell lines expressed SCF-1 mRNA, only two of them SCF-2, and these two also SCF-1. Coexpression of both SCF-1 and c-Kit was noted in five cell lines, and only one cell line as well as normal melanocytes expressed both SCF-1 and SCF-2 as well as c-Kit. Corresponding results were obtained on immunocytochemical staining. Of three exemplary melanoma cell lines studied, two expressing SCF mRNA also released SCF spontaneously and on stimulation, whereas the line lacking SCF and c-kit mRNA (SK-Mel-23) failed to do so. These data demonstrate thus that melanoma cell lines, particularly those known to metastasize in vivo, lose the ability to express SCF-2 mRNA, suggesting that this molecule may serve, next to c-Kit, as a prognostic marker for malignant melanoma.",

Furthermore, resistance frequently develops due to secondary mutations. Approaches to addressing both of these issues as well as combination therapies to optimise use of KIT kinase inhibitors are discussed.;This review covers the occurrence of oncogenic KIT mutations in different cancers and the molecular basis of their action. The action of KIT kinase inhibitors, especially imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib and PKC412, on different primary and secondary mutants is discussed. Outcomes of clinical trials in GIST, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), systemic mastocytosis and melanoma and their implications for future directions are considered.;Analysis of KIT mutations in individual patients is an essential prerequisite to the use of kinase inhibitors for therapy, and monitoring for development of secondary mutations that confer drug resistance is necessary.

Aberrant activation of c-Kit results in dysregulated signaling and is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. The development of more specific and effective c-Kit therapies is warranted given its essential role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we describe the biological properties of CK6, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the extracellular region of human c-Kit. CK6 specifically binds c-Kit receptor with high affinity (EC 50 = 0.06 nM) and strongly blocks its interaction with SCF (IC 50 = 0.41 nM) in solid phase assays. Flow cytometry shows CK6 binding to c-Kit on the cell surface of human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), melanoma, and leukemia tumor cell lines. Furthermore, exposure to CK6 inhibits SCF stimulation of c-Kit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT), in addition to reducing tumor cell line growth in vitro. CK6 treatment significantly decreases human xenograft tumor growth in NCI-H526 SCLC (T/C% = 57) and Malme-3M melanoma (T/C% = 58) models in vivo. The combination of CK6 with standard of care chemotherapy agents, cisplatin and etoposide for SCLC or dacarbazine for melanoma, more potently reduces tumor growth (SCLC T/C% = 24, melanoma T/C% = 38) compared with CK6 or chemotherapy alone. In summary, our results demonstrate that CK6 is a c-Kit antagonist antibody with tumor growth neutralizing properties and are highly suggestive of potential therapeutic application in treating human malignancies harboring c-Kit receptor.

To uncover other potential targetable mutations, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of a highly aggressive BRAF (V600) and KIT (W557, V559, L576, K642, and D816) wild-type melanoma. Surprisingly, we found a somatic BRAF(L597R) mutation in exon 15. Analysis of BRAF exon 15 in 49 tumors negative for BRAF(V600) mutations as well as driver mutations in KIT, NRAS, GNAQ, and GNA11, showed that two (4%) harbored L597 mutations and another two involved BRAF D594 and K601 mutations. In vitro signaling induced by L597R/S/Q mutants was suppressed by mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibition. A patient with BRAF(L597S) mutant metastatic melanoma responded significantly to treatment with the MEK inhibitor, TAK-733. Collectively, these data show clinical significance to BRAF(L597) mutations in melanoma.;This study shows that cells harboring BRAF(L597R) mutants are sensitive to MEK inhibitor treatment, providing a rationale for routine screening and therapy of BRAF(L597R)-mutant melanoma.",

In addition, the progression of human melanoma towards the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of expression of the tyrosine-kinase receptor c-KIT. This review summarizes our recent data demonstrating that the expression of both genes is regulated by the AP-2 transcription factor. Moreover, we have observed a loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells. Re-expression of AP-2 in the highly metastatic A375SM cells decreased their tumorigenicity and inhibited their metastatic potential in nude mice. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression was significantly downregulated while c-KIT expression was upregulated in the AP-2 transfected cells. Since AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as E-cadherin, MMP-2, p21WAF-1, HER-2, BCL-2, and insulin like growth factor receptor-1, we propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma.",

Twenty patients with metastatic uveal melanoma expressing c-kit, 17 of whom failed previous treatments, were included in this study. Patients received sunitinib malate 37.5 mg daily continuously in 4-week cycles. The evaluation of response was carried out every 8 weeks. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and differences in survivals were tested using the log-rank test. There was one partial response and 12 stable disease (SD) after sunitinib treatment. The median OS and PFS were 8.2 and 4.2 months, respectively. Three patients had SD for more than 12 months with sunitinib after failing previous treatments. The most common adverse events were fatigue (90%), diarrhea (60%), hemorrhage (55%), anorexia (45%), hand-foot syndrome (25%), hypothyroidism (25%), and rash (25%). Eleven patients required a dose reduction to 25 mg daily secondary to grade 3 adverse events. The degree of c-kit expression in melanoma cells was not associated with longer PFS or OS. Patients who developed systemic metastases after more than 5 years of their initial diagnosis had better PFS (median PFS: 5.8 vs. 2.6 months, P=0.005).

Coexpression of the growth factor and receptor suggests their role in autocrine or paracrine growth mechanisms. Imatinib mesylate was previously reported to have specific activity in inhibiting select tyrosine kinase receptors, including PDGF and c-Kit. Melanoma cells express abundant levels of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Nevertheless, c-Kit expression is progressively lost as the cells take on a more highly metastatic phenotype. To investigate the potential of imatinib mesylate as a therapy for melanoma, we studied its effect on the growth of melanoma cells using an in vivo mouse model. Melanoma cells with high malignant potential (PDGFR-positive, c-Kit-negative) or low malignant potential (PDGFR-positive, c-Kit-positive) were injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. Mice were treated with imatinib mesylate (100 mg/kg three times weekly) or with phosphate-buffered saline for 4 to 6 wk. PDGFR-alpha and -beta were expressed on all melanoma cell lines tested. The level of PDGFR expression correlated with the metastatic potential of the melanoma cells: higher levels of PDGFR-alpha were expressed on cells with higher metastatic potential, and higher levels of PDGFR-beta were expressed on cells with lower metastatic potential. There was no significant difference in tumor size between treated and control mice. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated inhibition of PDGFR phosphorylation on the tumors from mice treated with imatinib mesylate but not from control mice, suggesting that the receptors were functional and that the concentration of drug used was appropriate. Our data demonstrated that imatinib mesylate blocked both PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta in vivo.

Here we addressed the effect of mast cells in a tumor setting by using transgenic Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice, in which the deficiency of mast cells is independent of c-kit defects. Melanoma cells (B16.F10) were administered either subcutaneously or intravenously into Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice or Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ littermate controls, followed by the assessment of formed tumors. In the subcutaneous model, mast cells were abundant in the tumor stroma of control mice but were absent in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice. However, the absence of mast cells did not affect tumor size. In contrast, after intravenous administration of B16.F10 cells, melanoma colonization of the lungs was markedly reduced in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ vs. Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ animals. Decreased melanoma colonization of the lungs in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ animals was accompanied by increased inflammatory cell recruitment into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, suggesting that mast cells suppress inflammation in this setting. Further, qPCR analysis revealed significant alterations in the expression of Twist and E-cadherin in lungs of Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ vs. control Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ animals, suggesting an impact of mast cells on epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Growing evidence of distinct subtypes in humans, differing in somatic and predisposing germ-line genetic alterations, cell of origin, epidemiology, relationship to ultraviolet radiation and progression from benign to malignant tumors, may also exist in dogs. Canine and human mucosal melanomas appear to harbor BRAF, NRAS, and c-kit mutations uncommonly, compared with human cutaneous melanomas, although both species share AKT and MAPK signaling activation. We conclude that there is significant overlap in the clinical and histopathological features of canine and human mucosal melanomas. This represents opportunity to explore canine oral cavity melanoma as a preclinical model. ",

Adjuvant therapy decisions may be informed by careful consideration of prognostic factors. High-dose adjuvant interferon alpha-2b increases disease-free survival and may modestly improve overall survival. Less toxic alternatives for adjuvant therapy are currently under study. External beam radiation therapy is an option for nodal beds where the risk of local recurrence is very high. In-transit melanoma metastases may be treated locally with surgery, immunotherapy, radiation, or heated limb perfusion. For metastatic melanoma, the options include chemotherapy or immunotherapy; targeted anti-BRAF and anti-KIT therapy is under active investigation. Standard chemotherapy yields objective tumor responses in approximately 10%-20% of patients, and sustained remissions are uncommon. Immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2 yields objective tumor responses in a minority of patients; however, some of these responses may be durable. Identification of activating mutations of BRAF, NRAS, c-KIT, and GNAQ in distinct clinical subtypes of melanoma suggest that these are molecularly distinct.

These poor results may come from treating all melanomas as though they are biologically homogeneous. Recently, it has been shown that targeting specific activated tyrosine kinases (oncogenes) can have striking clinical benefits in patients with melanoma. In 2002, a V600E mutation of the BRAF serine/threonine kinase was described as present in more than 50% of all melanomas. The mutation appeared to confer a dependency by the melanoma cancer cell on activated signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The frequency and focality of this mutation (>95% of all BRAF mutations being at V600 position) suggested its importance in melanoma pathophysiology and potential as a target for therapy. The recent results of a phase 1 study with PLX4032/RG7204, a small molecule RAF inhibitor, confirm this hypothesis. Mucosal and acral-lentiginous melanomas, comprising 3% of all melanomas, frequently harbor activating mutations of c-kit and drugs targeting this mutation seem to confer similar benefits for these types of tumors.

Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is found in the majority of melanomas, with either somatic missense mutations of BRAF or, considerably more rarely, mutations of N-RAS. The loss of both products of the CDKN2A gene, proteins p16(ARF) and p14(INK4a), or amplification of microphthalmia-associated transcriptional factor (MITF) are also predisposing factors in the development of melanoma. BRAF mutations are observed mainly in melanomas on skin liable to intermittent UV exposure. Acral and mucosal melanomas, and also melanomas on skin damaged by chronic exposure to the sun are characterized by distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations with frequent amplifications and alterations of the KIT gene, while BRAF mutations are rarely found in these sites. Uveal melanomas show recurrent chromosomal losses (1p, 3, 6q) and gains (6p, 8q), but mutations of BRAF are hardly ever found. So far, ancillary molecular studies are not regularly applied in the routine diagnostic procedures performed when malignant melanoma is suspected.

In recent years, a substantial number of reports on individual miRNAs or miRNA patterns have been published providing strong evidence that miRNAs might play an important role in malignant melanoma and might help to better understand the molecular mechanisms of melanoma development and progression. A major preliminary finding was that melanoma-associated miRNAs are often located in genomic regions with frequent gains and losses in tumours. Detailed studies of different groups thereafter identified miRNAs with differential expression in benign melanocytes compared with melanoma cell lines or in benign melanocytic lesions compared with melanomas. Among these were let-7a and b, miR-23a and b, miR-148, miR-155, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-211, miR214, and miR-221 and 222. Some of these miRNAs target well-known melanoma-associated genes like the NRAS oncogene, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT or AP-2 transcription factors (TFAP2). Although we are still far from a complete understanding of the role of miRNA-target gene interactions in malignant melanoma, these findings further underscore the notion of a direct involvement of miRNAs in melanoma biology. Very recently, a prognostic signature of six miRNAs has been identified consisting of miRNAs miR-150, miR-342-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-145, miR-155, and miR-497. High expression of these miRNAs was shown to be associated with improved long-term survival of metastatic patients.",

Exon 14 of SF3B1, containing the site of recurrent mutations described in uveal melanoma, was sequenced in all samples. Additionally, NRAS exon 1 and 2 and BRAF exon 15 were sequenced in all, KIT exons 9, 11, 13, 17, and 18 in 30 samples. High numbers of BRAF and NRAS mutations were identified with frequencies varying according to melanoma subtype. None of the samples were found to harbor a SF3B1 mutation.;We conclude that recurrent mutations in codon 625 of SF3B1 as reported in uveal melanoma are not present in most types of cutaneous melanoma.

It is regulated by the balance between the activities of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases. A number of PTKs are encoded by proto-oncogenes or viral oncogenes, and are thus strongly implicated in cancer. While a role for PTKs in human melanoma is less firmly established, human melanomas or melanoma cells have been reported to contain more tyrosine phosphate than normal melanocytes, and some receptor PTKs (EPH-A2/ ECK and EPH-B3) are overexpressed in over 90% of melanoma cell lines. Other specific PTKs are also frequently overexpressed, including KDR and fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 (FGF-R4), while, interestingly, yet others, such as KIT and FES, are consistently downregulated in melanoma cell lines. All of these differentially expressed PTKs are candidates for gene products important in melanoma development. In addition, PTKs expressed in significant amounts in both benign and malignant melanocytes, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1-R), FGF-R1, HER2/NEU and FAK, are likely to play a role in melanoma genesis and progression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The molecular changes associated with the transition of melanoma cells from radial growth phase (RGP) to vertical growth phase [(VGP), metastatic phenotype] are not very well defined. We previously demonstrated that expression of the cell-surface adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 correlates directly with the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. In addition, the progression of human melanoma towards the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of expression of the tyrosine-kinase receptor c-KIT. In this review, I will summarize our recent studies demonstrating that the expression of both genes is regulated by the AP-2 transcription factor. Moreover, we have observed a loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells. Re-expression of AP-2 in the highly metastatic A375SM cells decreased their tumorigenicity and inhibited their metastatic potential in nude mice. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression was significantly down-regulated while c-KIT expression was up-regulated in the AP-2-transfected cells. To further investigate the role of AP-2 in the progression of human melanoma, we attempted to inactivate AP-2 in primary cutaneous melanoma by using a dominant-negative AP-2, or the AP-2B gene. Expression of AP-2B in SB-2 cells augmented their tumorigenicity in nude mice, and upregulated MMP-2 expression and activity. As AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as E-cadherin, p21/WAF-1, HER2/neu, Bcl-2, FAS/APO-1, IGF-R-1, VEGF and the thrombin receptor (PAR-1), we therefore propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma. In addition, the transition of melanoma cells from RGP to VGP is also associated with over-expression of the transcription factors CREB and ATF-1. The notion that the balance between AP-2 and CREB/ATF-1 expression determines the progression of melanoma cells towards the metastatic phenotype will be discussed.",

We are reporting here three cases of high grade tumors that were studied by a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel including cytokeratins, S100, HMB-45, Melan A, Tyrosinase, and MITF. All three tumors were also analyzed for the presence of BRAF mutations. All three metastatic tumors were negative for S100, Melan A, HMB-45 and Tyrosinase but positive for MITF. Subsequent to the diagnoses, previously existing or concurrent primary melanomas were identified in 2 of the 3 cases. Interestingly, S100, Melan A, and HMB-45 were positive in the primary tumors. No BRAF (V600E) mutations were identified in the three metastatic melanomas and CD 117 (c-kit) was positive in one of the cases.

We found that normal human melanocytes and a limited number of melanoma cells, e.g. WM35, WM39 and G361 cell lines, expressed the c-Kit gene together with tyrosinase and TRP-1 genes. When exposed to alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, these three cell lines also showed an increased tyrosinase (dopa-oxidase) activity. By incubating these cells with 20 ng/ml of stem cell factor (SCF) which is a ligand of c-Kit receptor, we found a transient increase of tyrosinase activity 2-4 h post-incubation, indicating an early response of tyrosinase activation, either by elevating tyrosinase protein expression or by tyrosinase protein modification (e.g. phosphorylation). However, Western blot analysis using anti-tyrosinase antibody suggested that there was no change of tyrosinase protein expression between SCF-treated and non-treated cells.

All cell lines except for one nonmetastatic line established from a primary melanoma lost expression of c-kit. Expression of the other four tyrosine kinase receptors varied among the lines. The expression level of individual tyrosine kinase receptor did not correlate with the metastatic potential of the cells.

We explored the function of melanoma-derived exosomes in the formation of primary tumors and metastases in mice and human subjects. Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently 'educating' bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and Met. Reducing Met expression in exosomes diminished the pro-metastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating CD45(-)C-KIT(low/+)TIE2(+) bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. RAB1A, RAB5B, RAB7 and RAB27A, regulators of membrane trafficking and exosome formation, were highly expressed in melanoma cells. Rab27A RNA interference decreased exosome production, preventing bone marrow education and reducing, tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70, an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Our data show that exosome production, transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis, has prognostic value and offers promise for new therapeutic directions in the metastatic process.",

Further mutations which can be approached by targeted therapies are found on the c-Kit and NRAS genes. Another promising approach is immunotherapy aimed to activate cytotoxic T cells.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that MUP and mucosal melanomas harbor different prevalences of TERT-promoter mutations. Thirty-nine patients with MUP and 53 patients with mucosal melanomas were retrieved. In total, 152 paraffin samples of 92 patients were analyzed, and in 38 patients, multiple samples were tested. Mutational analysis of the TERT-promoter, BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes was carried out. In total, 92 patients were eligible for mutational analysis. TERT-promoter mutations were found in 33 patients (35.9%): chr5, 1,295,228 C>T (18 patients); chr5, 1,295,250 C>T (11 patients); chr5, 1,295,228-229 CC>TT (three patients); chr5, 1,295,242-243 CC>TT (one patient).

No significant correlation was found between TERT-mutation and patient survival. The TERT-promoter genotype of MUP points toward a cutaneous and not mucosal origin.

We have previously demonstrated that the protein melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is involved in the metastasis of and immunosuppression in malignant melanoma.

We could show that an inhibition of MIA by a synthetic peptide decreased both the number of metastases as well as immunosuppression in a murine model of malignant melanoma. To control recurrence after surgical resection of a primary lesion, it is paramount to have diagnostic tools available that can detect a relapse due to the strong metastatic potential of melanoma. This follow-up is maintained with periodic re-examinations. Due to high cost and the associated radiation exposure, radiology examinations are avoided if possible. The analysis of prognostic markers in patient serum is therefore attractive. In this review, we focus on the quantitative analysis of the MIA protein as a prognostic tool because it has proven to be a useful serum marker for documenting disease progression of malignant melanoma. The MIA quantification assay itself is readily performed using an ELISA kit and common laboratory equipment. Because analysing MIA serum levels in combination with other established markers such as S100B improves their prognostic value, we feel that the quantification of MIA in the serum, among other markers, should be performed as a general standard of care in patients at risk of developing metastatic melanoma.

Targeting just a few out of several potential mutations, BRAF-Inhibitors such as PLX 4032 achieved already tremendous results in the therapy of metastatic melanoma. Up to now, the correlation of clinical, histomorphologic, and genetic features is, however, not understood. Even more, is it not well known precisely what kind of molecular changes predispose the primary melanoma for metastasis. The identification of morphological surrogates and prognostic parameters in tumors with such genetic alteration seems therefore crucial when differentiating and classifying this heterogeneous tumor entity in more detail and thus facilitates the stratification of prognosis as well as therapy.

Statistical analysis of receptor tyrosine kinase activation as well as ligand and receptor expression indicates that some receptors, such as FGFR3, may be activated via autocrine circuits. Short hairpin RNA knockdown targeting three of the active kinases identified in the screen, AXL, HER3, and IGF1R, inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells and knockdown of active AXL also reduced melanoma cell migration.

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is the most aggressive of the cutaneous malignancies, causing more than 9,000 deaths in the past year in the United States. Historically, systemic therapies have been largely ineffective, because melanoma is usually resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, during the past few years, several targeted therapies have proved effective in this challenging disease. These recent advances have been facilitated by an improved understanding of the driving genetic aberrations of melanoma, particularly mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, demonstrated an overall survival advantage in phase III trials and is an appropriate option for first-line therapy in metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma. Dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, also have been shown to be effective in phase III trials for BRAF mutant melanoma and may be additional treatment options as monotherapy or in combination pending regulatory approval. Additionally, imatinib is a promising targeted therapy for patients whose tumors harbor a KIT mutation in exons 11 and 13. Although these targeted agents cause objective responses and clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, resistance invariably develops. New targets and strategies to overcome acquired resistance are urgently needed. Furthermore, no effective targeted therapy has been developed for NRAS mutant tumors or in melanomas with as yet unknown driver mutations. In this review, we discuss current molecular targeted treatment options and promising ongoing research to develop new strategies to treat melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mucosal melanoma is an exceedingly rare variant of cutaneous melanoma that, due to its rarity, is poorly described and infrequently studied. Primary sites of origin include the head and neck, anorectum and vulvovaginal regions. It is uniquely different from cutaneous melanoma with respect to epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis and prognosis. The etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, exposure to UV light is not an apparent risk factor. Furthermore, distinct molecular features including a lower incidence of BRAF oncogene mutations but a higher incidence of KIT oncogene mutations suggest divergent genetic etiologies. Mucosal melanomas generally present at a later stage, are more aggressive and carry a worse prognosis regardless of the stage at diagnosis. Establishing standardized treatment guidelines has been challenging due to the rarity of the disease. Early detection provides the best chance at survival but is often difficult due to anatomic location. Surgery remains the primary therapeutic intervention if complete resection is technically feasible given the anatomic location. Radiotherapy may be used to achieve local control when resection is not feasible, or adjuvantly to enhance locoregional control, but most studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival. There are no consensus guidelines on the optimal systemic therapy, and regimens are often extrapolated from data based on therapies used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma. Clinical trials, particularly utilizing newer targeted therapies and immunotherapies, are investigating novel treatment approaches. ",

Growth and metastasis formation in melanomas are regulated by a network of cytokines, cytokine-receptors, and adhesion molecules. However, little is known about surface antigens and target expression profiles in human melanomas. We examined the cell surface antigen profile of human skin melanoma cells by multicolor flow cytometry, and compared their phenotype with 4 melanoma cell lines (A375, 607B, Mel-Juso, SK-Mel28). Melanoma cells were defined as CD45-/CD31- cells co-expressing one or more melanoma-related antigens (CD63, CD146, CD166). In most patients, melanoma cells exhibited ErbB3/Her3, CD44/Pgp-1, ICAM-1/CD54 and IGF-1-R/CD221, but did not express CD20, ErbB2/Her2, KIT/CD117, AC133/CD133 or MDR-1/CD243. Melanoma cell lines were found to display a similar phenotype. In most patients, a distinct subpopulation of melanoma cells (4-40%) expressed the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and ErbB4 together with PD-1 and NGF-R/CD271. Both the EPO-R+ and EPO-R- subpopulations produced melanoma lesions in NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) (NSG) mice in first and secondary recipients. Normal skin melanocytes did not express ErbB4 or EPO-R, but expressed a functional KIT receptor (CD117) as well as NGF-R, ErbB3/Her3, IGF-1-R and CD44. In conclusion, melanoma cells display a unique composition of surface target antigens and cytokine receptors. Malignant transformation of melanomas is accompanied by loss of KIT and acquisition of EPO-R and ErbB4, both of which are co-expressed with NGF-R and PD-1 in distinct subfractions of melanoma cells. However, expression of EPO-R/ErbB4/PD-1 is not indicative of a selective melanoma-initiating potential. ",

Progress has also been made in identifying potential targets in the pathways involved in apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of uveal melanoma. Among these pathways, the c-Kit, c-Met, and IGF-1R signal pathways and the PTEN-related PI3K-Akt pathway are the most important targets.

These effects are performed by activation of the SCF receptor, c-kit. Because of the potential use of SCF in patients undergoing chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, the effect of SCF on nonhematopoietic tumors requires investigation. To determine whether human tumor cell lines display c-kit receptors, we performed binding experiments with 125I-SCF on a breast carcinoma cell line (Du4475), a gastric carcinoma cell line (KATO III), a melanoma cell line (HTT144), as well as two small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (H69 and H128). The biologic effect of SCF on tumor cell lines was assessed by its ability to stimulate tritiated thymidine uptake and to enhance colony growth in methylcellulose. The breast carcinoma cell line, Du4475, as well as two small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, H69 and H128, exhibit high-affinity c-kit receptors with approximate binding affinities of 40, 100, and 90 pmol/L, respectively. The number of high-affinity receptors per cell ranged from 700 to 9,500. The gastric carcinoma cell line, as well as the melanoma cell line, showed trace binding of 125I-SCF. In the presence of SCF alone, or in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3, there was less than a 17% increase in the colony growth of Du4475, H69, or H128 cell lines. Postulating that the lack of growth response could be secondary to endogenous SCF production by the tumor cell lines, we used an RNAse protection assay to determine whether the tumor cell lines contain SCF messenger RNA (mRNA). In addition, we tested tumor cell line supernatants for the presence of secreted SCF protein by enzyme immunoassay, and analyzed the tumor cell lines for membrane-bound SCF by indirect immunofluorescence. Our results show that the Du4475, H69, and H128 cell lines, as well as a melanoma cell line (HTT144), have multiple copies of SCF mRNA. Soluble SCF protein was detected in the cell supernatants in the Du4475 and H69 cell lines and SCF was found on the surface of all four cell lines. These data show that some human solid tumor cell lines display high-affinity c-kit receptors and produce SCF, which can be detected on the cell surface. These results suggest the possibility that autocrine production of SCF by c-kit receptor-bearing tumor cells may enhance cell growth in tumor cell lines.",

Numerous studies, including our own, linked arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) supplementation to induction of apoptosis and decreased proliferation of various cancer cells. The cytotoxic effects result from lipid peroxidation and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which modify proteins and nucleic acids. DNA damage by ROS causes mutations and genomic instability, leading to uncontrolled proliferation or cell death. In the present work, four human melanoma cell lines differing in origin, doubling time, metastatic potential, and melanin content (A375, A2058, G361, and C32) were exposed to AA, EPA or DHA added into culture media in the concentrations ranging from 0 (control) to 100 mM. After 24 h incubation cytotoxicity of the analyzed acids was determined with TOX-2 (In Vitro Toxicology Assay Kit XTT Based, TOX-2, Sigma) test. The oxidative protein modifications were measured using Aldehyde Site (DNA and Protein) Detection Kit (Cayman). All the acids tested showed marked inhibition of cell proliferation. The observed effects were statistically significant and depended on the concentration. Decrease of proliferation, associated by oxidative protein and DNA damage (measured as aldehyde sites in cells), was observed for EPA and DHA (50 mM and 100 mM) in A375, A2058, and G361 cells. In case of C32 cell line, which is amelanotic melanoma, EPA and DHA inhibited cell proliferation at 100 mM only. The effect of DHA was more pronounced.

We analyzed genomics data from 136 uveal melanoma samples and found a recurrent mutation in CYSLTR2 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) encoding a p.Leu129Gln substitution in 4 of 9 samples that lacked mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, and PLCB4 but in 0 of 127 samples that harbored mutations in these genes. The Leu129Gln CysLT2R mutant protein constitutively activates endogenous Gαq and is unresponsive to stimulation by leukotriene.

Recent preclinical and clinical findings support the notion that melanoma is not one malignant disorder but rather a family of distinct molecular diseases. Incorporation of genetic signatures into the conventional histopathological classification of melanoma has great implications for development of new and effective treatments. Genes of the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway harbour alterations sometimes identified in people with melanoma. The mutation Val600Glu in the BRAF oncogene (designated BRAF(V600E)) has been associated with sensitivity in vitro and in vivo to agents that inhibit BRAF(V600E) or MEK (a kinase in the MAPK pathway). Melanomas arising from mucosal, acral, chronically sun-damaged surfaces sometimes have oncogenic mutations in KIT, against which several inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy.

The molecular changes associated with these transitions are not yet well defined. However, transcriptional regulation of some genes that are critical in melanoma progression is beginning to be elucidated. The first part of this review will focus on our recent studies demonstrating that progression of human melanoma is associated with loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2. In metastatic melanoma cells, this loss resulted in overexpression of MCAM/MUC18 and MMP-2, and lack of expression of c-KIT. In further investigations, we inactivated AP-2 in SB-2 primary cutaneous melanoma cells by using a dominant-negative AP-2, the AP-2B gene. Expression of AP-2B in SB-2 cells augmented their tumorigenicity in nude mice and upregulated MMP-2 expression and activity. We have also recently demonstrated that loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells resulted in overproduction of the thrombin receptor, PAR-1. Other studies have shown that AP-2 regulates additional genes involved in melanoma development and progression, including E-cadherin, p21/WAF-1, HER2, Bcl-2, FAS/APO-1, IGF-R-1, and VEGF. We propose that loss of AP-2 is crucial in the development of malignant melanoma. Additionally, the transition of melanoma cells from RGP to VGP is associated with overexpression of two transcription factors, CREB and ATF-1, both of which may act as survival factors for human melanoma cells. The second part of the review will briefly discuss the role of other transcription factors, including ATF-2, SNAIL, MITF, and NFkappaB in the progression of human melanoma and will summarize recent knowledge on how changes in the expression of these transcription factors contribute to acquisition of the metastatic phenotype in human melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The melanoma cell adhesion molecule was identified as a human melanoma-associated antigen that increases in expression as tumors increase in thickness and begin to acquire metastatic potential. Clinical and experimental evidences suggest that the development of metastatic capacity might be the consequence of increased melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression. The mechanisms for upregulation of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule during melanoma progression are, however, still poorly understood. In this study, we show that melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. Using a combination of CAT reporter assays and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we observed that cyclic adenosine monophosphate significantly increases transcription of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule in nonmetastatic melanoma cells. In metastatic cells, transcription of the gene was constitutive and could not be further increased by cyclic adenosine monophosphate. On the other hand, melanoma cell adhesion molecule promoter activity was impeded upon treatment with phorbol esters or in the presence of stem cell factor, a phenomenon which was protein kinase C-dependent. Promoter-deletion studies demonstrated that the first 196 nt of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule promoter region are sufficient to get full expression in metastatic melanoma cells. This fragment contains five binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 and DNA mobility shift experiments showed direct binding of Sp1 to the promoter. In conclusion, our results indicate that Sp1 is sufficient to drive constitutive melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression in metastatic melanoma cells. In nonmetastatic cells, however, melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression is repressed and we speculate that stem cell factor/c-Kit signaling might be responsible for the control of melanoma cell adhesion molecule synthesis, and thus, perhaps, of melanoma progression and metastasis.",

Glutathione was labelled with 99Tcm by a Sn2+ reduction method with an efficiency of > 99% as determined by instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC). Anti-melanoma antibody was obtained as a kit from SORIN (Italy) and labelled with 99TcmO-4. Forty-three patients with a total of 55 biopsy-proven metastatic melanoma foci, 1 ocular melanoma and 20 benign pathologic foci, also confirmed by ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were included in the study after giving their informed consent. Following the intravenous (i.v.) injection of 500 MBq 99Tcm-AMAb, scintigraphic images of the involved areas were obtained 6 h post-injection. Three days later, the same patients were given 500 MBq 99Tcm-GSH i.v. and images were obtained 6 and 24 h post-injection. The images were classified as positive (focal abnormal accumulation) or negative. Quantitative evaluation was also applied. Regions of interest were drawn over the involved areas and nearby soft tissues and the target-to-nontarget (T/NT) ratios obtained with 99Tcm-AMAb (T/NT: 1.92 +/- 0.2) and 99Tcm-GSH (T/NT: 1.84 +/- 0.2) were compared (0.1 < P < or = 0.3). The sensitivity (and specificity) of 99Tcm-AMAb and 99Tcm-GSH in the detection of malignant melanoma metastases were 91% (95%) and 84% (90%), respectively. Compared with 99Tcm-AMAb, the advantages of 99Tcm-GSH are lower levels of blood radioactivity, lower costs and easy in-house preparation. In conclusion, our results show that 99Tcm-GSH is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for the detection of metastases of malignant melanoma.",

Our aims were to assess the reactivity of PG-M1 with a series of primary cutaneous and metastatic melanomas and to establish the potential usefulness of this antibody in the differentiation between histiocytes and histiocytic tumors and melanomas. PG-M1 staining was performed in 50 primary cutaneous and metastatic melanomas. For comparison, additional sections were stained with KP-1 and lysozyme (commonly used as histiocytic markers) and with S-100 and HMB-45 (commonly used as melanoma markers). The intensity (1+, 2+) and extent (1+ to 4+) were recorded semiquantitatively. PG-M1 stained weakly (1+) and focally (2+) only four cases of melanoma (8%). In contrast, histiocytes were strongly reactive for PG-M1 in all cases, being readily differentiated from melanoma cells including the positive cases. KP-1 stained melanoma cells in 44 cases (88%), lysozyme in 11 cases (22%), S-100 in 50 cases (100%), and HMB-45 in 48 cases (96%). No changes were found after restaining of selected KP-1 and lysozyme positive melanomas using an endogenous avidin/biotin blocking kit.

Traditional therapeutics and immunomodulatory agents have not shown much efficacy against metastatic melanoma. Agents that target the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway - the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib - have increased survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. Further, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has been shown to be superior to single agent therapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, resistance to these agents develops rapidly. Studies of additional agents and combinations targeting the MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K), c-kit, and other signaling pathways are currently underway. Furthermore, studies of phytochemicals have yielded promising results against proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis by targeting signaling pathways with established roles in melanomagenesis. The relatively low toxicities of phytochemicals make their adjuvant use an attractive treatment option. The need for improved efficacy of current melanoma treatments calls for further investigation of each of these strategies. In this review, we will discuss synthetic small molecule inhibitors, combined therapies and current progress in the development of phytochemical therapies. ",

It occurs predominantly in the lower extremities of young adults, manifesting as a deep, painless, slow-growing mass. CCS is sometimes confused with other types of melanoma because of its melanocytic differentiation. Although BRAF and KIT mutations are well-known melanocytic tumour-promoting mutations frequently found in cutaneous melanoma, they are rare or absent in CCS. We present two cases of CCS with different clinical and genetic features. Both female patients, aged 25 and 20 years, presented with a palpable nodule on a lower extremity. Biopsies of both tumours revealed features diagnostic of CCS. Each tumour cell was positive for S100 protein and HMB-45. However, one patient's tumour was localized to the dermis, with many multinucleated giant cells, whereas the other was located in the deep subcutaneous fat layer near bone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of a characteristic Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding protein (EWSR)1 gene rearrangement in both cases. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the PCR product revealed an EWSR1-activating transcription factor 1 type 1 fusion transcript in both cases. In addition, we detected BRAF mutation in the dermal type and KIT mutation in the subcutaneous type. It is of interest that the BRAF and KIT mutations are known to be very rare in CCS. On the basis of our observations, we suggest that mutation inhibitors may be useful in selected patients with mutated CCS lineages.",

Our results revealed that the methylome, presenting in early stage samples and associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation, gradually decreased in the medium and late stages of the disease. An inverse relationship among the other predefined groups and promoter methylation was also revealed except for histologic subtype, whereas the more aggressive, nodular subtype melanomas exhibited hypermethylation as well. The Breslow thickness, which is a continuous variable, allowed for the most precise insight into how promoter methylation decreases from stage to stage. Integrating our methylation results with a high-throughput copy number alteration dataset, local correlations were detected in the MYB and EYA4 genes. With regard to the effects of DNA hypermethylation on melanoma patients' survival, correcting for clinical cofounders, only the KIT gene was associated with a lower overall survival rate.

        "Doc_abstract":"To determine treatment strategies and predict the clinical outcome of patients with melanoma it is important to understand the etiology of this disease. Recently, there has been some insight into molecular basis of melanoma including identification of a few of the regulatory factors and genes involved in this disease. For instance, the transcription factor AP-2 plays a tumor suppressor-like role in melanoma progression by regulating genes involved in tumor growth and metastasis. Previously, we have shown that the progression of human melanoma to the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of AP-2 expression and deregulation of target genes such as MUC18/MCAM, c-KIT, and MMP-2. Increasing evidence demonstrates that the thrombin receptor (protease-activated receptor-1, PAR-1) plays a major role in tumor invasion and contributes to the metastatic phenotype of human melanoma. This review focuses on the role of the thrombin receptor in melanoma and its regulation by AP-2. We show that loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells correlates with overexpression of the thrombin receptor. Our analysis of AP-2/Sp1 complexes within the regulatory region of the thrombin receptor demonstrates that AP-2 binds the proximal 3' region of the promoter and diminishes PAR-1 expression. Levels of AP-2 and Sp1 proteins in a panel of melanoma cell lines demonstrated a marked decrease in the ratio of AP-2/Sp1, a decrease that correlated with overexpression of PAR-1 in metastatic melanoma cells. We propose that loss of AP-2 results in increased expression of the thrombin receptor, which subsequently contributes to the metastatic phenotype of melanoma by upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules, proteases, and angiogenic molecules.",

However, the possible function of miR-26b in human melanoma cells remains unclarified. In this study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to explore the expression profiles of miR-26b in melanoma cells. The effect of miR-26b on cell viability was determined by using MTT assays and colony formation assay. The apoptosis levels were evaluated by using Annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection kit and the apoptosis cells were confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed to confirm direct targeting. Our study found that the expression of miR-26b was downregulated in human melanoma specimens. Overexpression of miR-26b significantly increased the anti-proliferative effects and apoptosis in A375 and B16F10 melanoma cells. In addition, luciferase gene reporter assays confirmed that TRAF5 was a direct target gene of miR-26b and the anti-tumor effect of miR-26b in melanoma cells was significantly counteracted by treatment with TRAF5 overexpression. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressor of miR-26b in malignant melanomas may be due to the dephosphorylation of MAPK pathway caused by the decrease in TRAF5 expression when miR-26b is up-regulated in melanoma cells. These findings indicate that miR-26b might influence TRAF5-MAPK signaling pathways to facilitate the malignant progression of melanoma cells. ",

The expression of NGF-R was modulated ambiguously by these substances but demonstrated a cell line specificity in the different melanoma cell lines tested.

Although a great deal of progress has been made in the past decade, including the development of immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy using BRAF, MEK or KIT inhibitors, treatment for unresectable stage III, stage IV, and recurrent melanoma is still challenging with limited response rate, severe side effects and poor prognosis, highlighting an urgent need for discovering and designing more effective approaches to conquer melanoma. Melanoma is not only driven by malignant melanocytes, but also by the altered communication between neoplastic cells and non-malignant cell populations, including fibroblasts, endothelial and inflammatory cells, in the tumor stroma. Infiltrated and surrounding fibroblasts, also known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), exhibit both phenotypical and physiological differences compared to normal dermal fibroblasts. They acquire properties of myofibroblasts, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) and architecture of the diseased tissue and secrete chemical factors, which all together promote the transformation process by encouraging tumor growth, angiogenesis, inflammation and metastasis and contribute to drug resistance. A number of in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that stromal fibroblasts promote melanoma cell proliferation and they have been targeted to suppress tumor growth effectively. Evidently, a combination therapy co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts may provide promising strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes and overcome treatment resistance. A significant benefit of targeting CAFs is that the approach aims to create a tumor-resistant environment that inhibits growth of melanomas carrying different genetic mutations. However, the origin of CAFs and precise mechanisms by which CAFs contribute to melanoma progression and drug resistance remain poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the origin, activation and heterogeneity of CAFs in the melanoma tumor microenvironment and examine the contributions of stromal fibroblasts at different stages of melanoma development. We also highlight the recent progression in dissecting and characterizing how local fibroblasts become reprogrammed and build a dynamic yet optimal microenvironment for tumors to develop and metastasize. In addition, we review key developments in ongoing preclinical studies and clinical applications targeting CAFs and tumor-stroma interactions for melanoma treatment. ",

CTC number was determined using the CellSearch platform and melanoma kits in samples taken at baseline and serially during treatment. CTC numbers ranged between 0 and 36 per 7.5 ml blood; 26% of patients had ≥ 2 CTCs. Baseline CTC number was prognostic for median overall survival (OS) in univariate analysis (2.6 vs. 7.2 months (P<0.011) for patients with ≥ 2 CTCs vs. <2 CTCs, respectively). In multivariate analysis, CTC number was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS (hazard ratio (HR) 2.403, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.303-4.430, P=0.005). Patients receiving treatment in whom CTC number remained ≥ 2 CTCs during treatment had shorter median OS than those who maintained <2 CTCs (7 vs. 10 months, HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.81, log-rank test P=0.015). In conclusion, CTC number in metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients is prognostic for OS with a cutoff of 2 CTCs per 7.5 ml blood.

Anorectal malignant melanomas are notorious for their diversity of histologic features and mimic a number of other tumors.

Aim of our study was to describe the common as well as unusual architectural and cytologic features that create difficulty in diagnosis. We also discussed the role of immunohistochemical stains in diagnosis of AMMs. We retrieved and reviewed 61 cases of anal melanoma diagnosed in our institution between January 2005 and May 2014. Epithelioid cell type was observed in 57 (93.4%) cases, spindle cells in 35 (57.4%) cases, pleomorphic in 12 (19.7%) cases, and lymphoma-like in 2 (3.3%) cases. Cytoplasmic clearing was observed in 16.4% and nuclear pseudoinclusions in 9.8% cases. Twenty-one point three percent cases were completely amelanotic, and 36.1% showed focal melanin pigment. Average mitotic count was 2 mitoses/high-power fields. Nesting pattern was seen in 24.6%, pseudoalveolar pattern in 11.5%, and peritheliomatous/pseudopapillary pattern in 5% cases.

Cytokeratins were positive in 9% and CD117 (c-kit) in 20% of cases in which they were performed. In conclusion, AMMs should be considered in the differential of any malignant tumor of anorectal region without obvious glandular and squamoid differentiation. The knowledge of amelanotic nature, unusual histologic features, and aberrant immunohistochemical expression is helpful in avoiding misdiagnosis. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Systemic targeted molecular therapy, in the form of a selective BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma with unresectable stage III and IV disease. Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies. ",

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib significantly improved overall survival. However, brain metastases still limit the effectiveness of this therapy. In a series of patients, we observed that treatment with vemurafenib resulted in substantial regression of extracerebral metastases, but brain metastases developed. This study aimed to identify factors that contribute to treatment resistance in brain metastases. Matched brain and extracerebral metastases from melanoma patients had identical ERK, p-ERK, and AKT immunohistochemistry staining patterns, but there was hyperactivation of AKT (p-AKT) and loss of PTEN expression in the brain metastases. Mutation analysis revealed no differences in BRAF, NRAS, or KIT mutation status in matched brain and extracerebral metastases. In contrast, AKT, p-AKT, and PTEN expression was identical in monolayer cultures derived from melanoma brain and extracerebral metastases. Furthermore, melanoma cells stimulated by astrocyte-conditioned medium showed higher AKT activation and invasiveness than melanoma cells stimulated by fibroblast-conditioned medium. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling resensitized melanoma cells isolated from a vemurafenib-resistant brain metastasis to vemurafenib. Brain-derived factors appear to induce hyperactivation of the AKT survival pathway and to promote the survival and drug resistance of melanoma cells in the brain. Thus, inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling shows potential for enhancing and/or prolonging the antitumor effect of BRAF inhibitors or other anticancer agents in melanoma brain metastases.",

In contrast to most human melanomas with an early onset of metastasis, the Grey horse melanomas have an extended period of benign growth, after which 50% or more eventually undergo progression and may metastasize. In efforts to define changes occurring during Grey horse melanoma progression, we established an in vitro model comprised of two cell lines, HoMel-L1 and HoMel-A1, representing a primary and a metastatic stage of the melanoma, respectively. The cell lines were examined for their growth and morphological characteristics, in vitro and in vivo oncogenic potential, chromosome numbers, and expression of melanocytic antigens and tumor suppressors. Both cell lines exhibited malignant characteristics; however, the metastatic HoMel-A1 showed a more aggressive phenotype characterized by higher proliferation rates, invasiveness, and a stronger tumorigenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. HoMel-A1 displayed a near-haploid karyotype, whereas HoMel-L1 was near-diploid. The cell lines expressed melanocytic lineage markers such as TYR, TRP1, MITF, PMEL, ASIP, MC1R, POMC, and KIT. The tumor suppressor p53 was strongly expressed in both cell lines, while the tumor suppressors p16 and PTEN were absent in HoMel-A1, potentially implicating significance of these pathways in the melanoma progression. This in vitro model system will not only aid in understanding of the Grey horse melanoma pathogenesis, but also in unraveling the steps during melanoma progression in general as well as being an invaluable tool for development of new therapeutic strategies.

Also mutated c-KIT has been identified as a promising target. Meanwhile, evidence has been provided that combinations between BRAF inhibitors and MEK1/2 inhibitors are more promising than single-agent treatments. Moreover, new treatment algorithms favor sequential treatment using BRAF inhibitors and newly developed immunotherapies targeting common T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). In depth molecular analyses have uncovered new mechanisms of treatment resistance and recurrence, which may impact on future treatment decisions. Moreover, next-generation sequencing data have shown that recurrent lesions harbor specific genetic aberrations. At the same time, high throughput sequencing studies of melanoma unraveled a series of new treatment candidates for future treatment approaches such as ERBB4, GRIN2A, GRM3, and RAC1. More recent bioinformatic technologies provided genetic evidence for extensive tumor heterogeneity and tumor clonality of solid tumors, which might also be of relevance for melanoma. However, these technologies have not yet been applied to this tumor. In this review, an overview on the genetic basis of current treatment of melanoma, treatment resistance and recurrences including new treatment perspectives based on recent high-throughput sequencing data is provided.

        "Doc_abstract":"The molecular changes associated with the transition of melanoma cells from radial growth phase (RGP) to vertical growth phase (VGP) and the metastatic phenotype are not very well defined. However, some of the genes involved in this process and their transcriptional regulation are beginning to be elucidated. For example, the switch from RGP to VGP and the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of the AP-2α transcription factor. AP-2α regulates the expression of c-KIT, MMP-2, VEGF, and the adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18. Recently, we reported that AP-2α also regulates two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) PAR-1 and PAFR. In turn, the thrombin receptor, PAR-1, regulates the expression of the gap junction protein Connexin-43 and the tumor suppressor gene Maspin. Activation of PAR-1 also leads to overexpression and secretion of proangiogenic factors such as IL-8, uPA, VEGF, PDGF, as well certain integrins. PAR-1 also cooperates with PAFR to regulate the expression of the MCAM/MUC18 via phosphorylation of CREB. The ligands for these GPCRs, thrombin and PAF, are secreted by stromal cells, emphasizing the importance of the tumor microenvironment in melanoma metastasis. The metastatic phenotype of melanoma is also associated with overexpression and function of CREB/ATF-1. Loss of AP-2α and overexpression of CREB/ATF-1 results in the overexpression of MCAM/MUC18 which by itself contributes to melanoma metastasis by regulating the inhibitor of DNA binding-1 (Id-1). CREB/ATF-1 also regulates the angiogenic factor CYR-61. Our recent data indicate that CREB/ATF-1 regulates the expression of AP-2α, thus, supporting the notion that CREB is an important \"master switch\" in melanoma progression.",

The genetic mutations of PDGFRA were unrelated to the age, thickness, and ulceration status of primary melanomas. Thirteen mutations were not reported before, and five (P577S, V658A, R841K, H845Y, and G853D) of them resulted in strong autophosphorylation of PDGFRA.

Expression of the cDNA in mammalian cells results in the secretion of this peptide with mitogenic activity. MGSA is structurally related to the platelet-derived beta-thromboglobulin and to several other polypeptides. These factors may constitute a family of growth factors. MGSA mRNA was detected in a variety of cell types. The level of MGSA mRNA in melanoma cells is strongly elevated by treatment with MGSA. MGSA is the gene product of a recently detected gene gro. The gene was mapped to chromosome 4 (region q13----q21).

The malfunction of KIT gene results in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-KIT which is believed to be the major oncogenic event in stomach, small intestine mastocytosis, acute leukemias, melanomas and colon tumors. The genetics of these diseases could be better understood by knowing the functional relevance of their SNP variation. In this study, a computational analysis to detect the most deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs of KIT gene was performed and investigated its binding affinity to native and predicted mutant protein structure (D816V) with sunitinib and HDAC (Trichostatin A and Panobinostat) inhibitors was investigated. Out of 1,288 SNPs retrieved from dbSNP database against KIT gene, 11 non-synonymous SNPs were detected to be damaging and deleterious by SIFT, PolyPhen and I-Mutant2.0 servers. Further, we modeled the mutant protein based on the deleterious nsSNP (rs121913507) and showed that the mutation from Aspartic acid to Valine at 816 position exhibit greatest impact on stability. The RMSD values of mutant and native structures are found to be 0.40 and 1.9 A, respectively. Furthermore, the binding affinity of sunitinib and HDAC inhibitors were compared with native and mutant protein. In this regard, it was found that trichostatin A has a high binding efficacy towards the mutant protein with a binding energy of -35.274 kcal mol(-1), as compared to the native structure which has a binding energy of -25.996 kcal mol(-1). Also, the FastSNP tool suggested that 3 SNPs found to affect protein splicing site and splicing regulation. From present results, it was clear that the non-synonymous SNP rs121913507 (D816V) could be the most deleterious SNP for KIT gene and HDAC inhibitors can serve as a best drug for the mutant protein.",

        "Doc_abstract":"MCAM/MUC18 is a cell-surface glycoprotein of 113 kDa, originally identified as a melanoma antigen, whose expression is associated with tumor progression and the development of metastatic potential. We have previously shown that enforced expression of MCAM/MUC18 in primary cutaneous melanoma led to increased tumor growth and metastatic potential in nude mice. The mechanism for up-regulation of MCAM/MUC18 during melanoma progression is unknown. Here we show that up-regulation of MCAM/MUC18 expression in highly metastatic cells correlates with loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2. The MCAM/MUC18 promoter contains four binding sites for AP-2, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay gels demonstrated that the AP-2 protein bound directly to the MCAM/MUC18 promoter. Transfection of AP-2 into highly metastatic A375SM melanoma cells (AP-2-negative and MCAM/MUC18-positive) inhibited MCAM/MUC18 promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in AP-2-transfected but not in control cells. In addition, re-expression of AP-2 in A375SM cells inhibited their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice. These results indicate that the expression of MCAM/MUC18 is regulated by AP-2 and that enforced AP-2 expression suppresses tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of human melanoma cells, possibly by down-regulating MCAM/MUC18 gene expression. Since AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as c-KIT, E-cadherin, MMP-2, and p21(WAF-1), we propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma.",

His grandmother had died of pancreatic cancer and his mother had been operated for rectal cancer. Physical examination revealed a hard mass at the 12 o'clock position, 2 cm from the anal verge. A colonoscopic examination revealed an irregular surface mass, approximately 4.0 cm in size, located on the anterior wall of the lower rectum. A biopsy of the rectal tumor showed the proliferation of epithelioid cells with pleomorphic features. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed. S-100 protein, CD-56, and KIT expression were positive, but HMB-45 expression was negative. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple liver and lymph node metastases. With the diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the rectum, abdominoperineal resection was performed. After the operation, the serum lactate dehydrogenase level had rapidly increased. An abdominal CT showed progressive liver metastases. Thirteen days after the surgery, abdominal angiography was performed, which showed multiple hypervascular tumor stains in the liver. The reservoir was implanted transcutaneously with the aid of angiography and the catheter was fixed to the proper hepatic artery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy using cisplatin and irinotecan via the subcutaneous reservoir port was performed and a partial response was obtained. However, the final pathological diagnosis of the surgically resected specimen was malignant amelanotic melanoma of the rectum. Immunohistochemical expression differed between rectal biopsy specimens and surgically resected specimens. HMB-45 expression was positive and KIT expression was negative in the resected specimen. As preoperative pathological diagnosis showed rare rectal tumor, we measured the chemosensitivity of the rectal tumor using the collagen gel droplet-embedded culture drug sensitivity test (CD-DST) to determine the most appropriate chemotherapy regimen for the patient. However, there were no anticancer drugs tested by CD-DST for malignant melanoma. With informed consent, the patient received two cycles of immunochemotherapy consisting of dacabazine, nimustine hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and interferon -beta. Although the patient was treated with immunochemotherapy for metastatic liver tumor, he died because of progression of metastases.",

A new feature, however, is the establishment of molecular classification of melanoma indicating that beside the most frequent genetic alterations (BRAF, NRAS, CKIT mutations) there is a wide variety of rare molecular subclasses. Unfortunately, none of these genetic alterations can be used to discriminate benign lesions from malignant ones. The frequently used \"melanoma\" markers are mostly melanosomal markers, therefore they are not helpful for this diagnostic purpose either. More recently, novel FISH kits have been developed analyzing characteristic copy number alterations specific for malignant melanoma. Though melanosomal markers are helpful in differencial diagnostics, the presence of normal melanocytes in various tissues (lymph nodes, intestine or brain) requires application of molecular techniques when melanoma metastasis is in question. ;A malignus melanóma patológiai klasszifikációja az utóbbi években csak az UV-besugárzással kapcsolatos jelenségek tekintetében változott.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer of pigment-producing cells, derivates of the neural crest. Surgical resection is the most effective form of treatment during initial phases of the disease. Advanced stages are usually treated by adjuvant immunotherapy (interferon alpha) or dacarbazine + multiferon. Response and survival rates are extremely poor. The emerging approach of personalized medicine brings about significant advances in the treatment of melanoma. Apart from administration of imatinib for a small subgroup of melanomas harbouring KIT mutations, the most promising approach is the use of B-RAF kinase inhibitors. The previously tested RAF inhibitors (e.g. sorafenib) did not perform better compared to conventional chemotherapy or immunotherapy. However, the results are much more promising with the recently developed inhibitor PLX4032 (Plexxikon; RG7204, Roche Pharmaceuticals; vemurafenib). This inhibitor targets tumours harbouring B-RAF(V600E) of B-RAF(V600K) activating mutations, which are present in 40-70% of malignant melanomas. An absence of the above mentioned activating mutations or parallel presence of activating RAS mutations (e.g. RAS(G12D)) should be used as contraindications. The use of PLX4032 provides better outcome than any of the currently used therapies, including partial or complete response recorded in 81% of patients, and prolonged median survival. Currently, this drug is being tested in phase II and III trials. The incidence of PLX4032-related adverse effects is relatively high; acquired resistance repeatedly occurring within several months of treatment may also represent a significant problem. Combined therapy is probably needed to further increase the complete response rate and to prolong survival. This should either include some of the currently used chemotherapeutics, or alternatively it may employ inhibitors of some of the kinases capable of stimulating the MEK and ERK kinases independently of B-RAF (e.g. COT). Nevertheless, even PLX4032 monotherapy should be viewed as a significant improvement of the current state-of-the-art treatment of malignant melanoma.",

Analysis either by real-time PCR coupled with fluorescence melting curve analysis or by PCR followed by direct sequencing, along with studies for DNA mismatch repair status using immunohistochemistry, disclosed that 15 out of the 16 cases displayed wild-type genotypes, with a single case of vulvar primary melanoma, harboring the activating mutation BRAF(V600E). Investigations on whether this could reflect partly an efficient mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism were confirmed by normal expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2, suggesting that the lack of mutations could be explained by the operation of alternative pathogenetic mechanisms modulating downstream effectors of the signaling pathways. Our data suggest the presence of additional genetic components and provide the impetus for systematic approaches to reveal these yet unidentified genetic parameters. ",

We also used quantitative PCR to quantitatively assess the expression of NRAS among normal cells, including fibroblast and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells from our patient. Full autopsy documented tumors in the brain, spinal cord, lung, liver, testis, bone marrow, and, retrospectively, in the placenta. Next-generation sequencing and chromosome microarray in our patient revealed novel findings, including duplication of a mutated NRAS gene, leading to an aggressive clinical course and disseminated disease. Quantitative PCR showed a five-fold increase in NRAS expression in the melanoma cell line when compared with normal melanocytes. Finally, three amino acid-changing germline variants were detected: homozygous TP53 p.P72R, heterozygous KIT p.M541L, and homozygous KDR (VEGFR2) p.Q472H. These genes are involved in malignancy and other potentially relevant pathways, such as mast cell and melanocytic signaling, as well as angiogenesis.

ERK1/2 levels were determined using an ELISA kit. Adenosine and inosine levels were quantified using an enzyme-coupled assay. Adenosine caused cell proliferation through AR activation. Adenosine deaminase increased inosine levels (nanomolar concentrations) on the extracellular space, in a time-dependent manner, inducing proliferation through A3 AR activation. Micromolar concentrations of inosine enhanced proliferation through A3 AR activation, causing an increase in ERK1/2 levels, and P2Y1 R activation via ENT-dependent mechanisms.

Invasion of the optic nerve, and tumor growth outside the orbit, attested to the malignancy of these RPE-derived melanomas. The widespread melanosis previously seen in mice with this transgene was absent when W/Wv was added, thus validating its chief origin from neural crest cells.",

It comprises number of pathological changes within immune network including imbalance in cytokines of Th1/Th2 origin. The objectives of our study were (i) to evaluate the abnormalities in serum levels of selected cytokines in malignant melanoma patients with regional lymph node metastases as compared to normal values, (ii) to examine the relationship between postoperative cytokine levels and disease progression and (iii) to correlate cytokine profile changes during IFN-alpha therapy with the disease progression and potential therapeutical response. Nine Th1/Th2 related cytokines and sIL-2R were determined in 26 malignant melanoma patients at clinical stage III prior and during adjuvant immunotherapy. Control group consisted of 26 healthy persons. Patients were treated with rIFN-alpha according to EORTC Melanoma group protocol 18952. Cytokines were quantified in patients sera using commercial ELISA kits. Majority of melanoma patients showed significantly lower values of IL-2 and IFN-gamma and pathologically elevated levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 as compared to healthy subjects what indicates disease associated Th1/Th2 imbalance. In addition increased IL-12 and IL-15 values were noted in some patients (54% and 27%, respectively). All patients who manifested early relapse during immunotherapy had significantly lower pretreatment levels of IL-2 and IL-12 than those remaining without progression and probably benefiting from the treatment. Cytokine changes during immunotherapy disclosed that decreases in IL-2 and IL-12 and raises in IL-6 and IL-10 values occurred at least one month prior to relapse. Moreover, the continuous elevation of TNF-alpha and sIL-2R could be observed in patients who remained without progression during 10 months lasting immunotherapy. Our data illustrate that malignant melanoma associates with Th1/Th2 perturbances which are directed towards extended Th2 responses and that measurement of selected cytokines of Th1/Th2 category may be used as an early signal of disease deterioration and for evaluation of immunotherapy response.",

In GM, we report somatic mutations in KIT and TP53. Conversely, AGN had frequent BRAF V600E mutations, which were not seen in any of the GM.

The newly established metastatic melanoma (MM) cell line MO-1 was characterized for its sensitivity to vemurafenib and nab-paclitaxel, both already utilized for the treatment of MM.;All analyses were carried out by comparing results with those found in MM cells wild type for BRAF or mutated in V600. In addition, cellular effectors were investigated by ELISA kits, western blotting and flow cytometry.;The exposure to vemurafenib inhibited MO-1 cell proliferation at concentrations similar to those obtained in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma models, and an explanation of this sensitivity is the strong activation of Erk1/2 and the low expression of MITF. Nab-paclitaxel strongly reduced proliferation of MO-1 cells perhaps for the very low expression level of PMEL17, transcriptionally regulated by MITF and negatively involved in determining sensitivity to taxanes.;Thus, the mutation BRAF G469A in MM might be related to a weak effectiveness of therapy with BRAF inhibitors and a promising therapeutic approach may be with nab-paclitaxel.",

Correlations between sIL-2R values, baseline patients and tumour features were studied by contingency tables and the chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was applied to plot disease-free survival (DFS) curves. Univariate analysis was performed with the Log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to analyse the effect of several risk factors on DFS. In total, 2330 blood samples were collected during follow-up of 329 MM patients. Forty-five (13.7%) patients had Breslow tumour thickness<or=1.00, 83 (25.2%) patients>1.00 and <or=2.00 mm, 72 (21.9%) patients>2.00 and <or=4.00 mm, and 47 (14.3%) patients>4.00 mm. Ulceration was present in 64 cases (19.4%). Thirty-nine sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) (11.8%) were infiltrated by MM. Soluble IL-2R values ranged from 130 to 1420 U/ml; median value was 500 U/ml. One hundred twenty-one (36.8%) patients presented with sIL-2R>600 U/ml at first measure (FM), 194 patients (58.9%) with values increasing up to or more than 600 U/ml [increasing values (IV) pattern]. A correlation was found between Breslow's tumour values and the IV sIL-2R pattern group (P=0.0304 with chi2 test). Gender, presence of ulceration, Breslow tumour thickness, FM and IV sIL-2R pattern groups had a significant prognostic value for DFS. At multivariate analysis, presence of ulceration, gender, FM and IV sIL-2R pattern groups emerged as independent prognostic factors for DFS. The 5-year DFS rate was 88% for patients with FM<600 U/ml and 76.9% for patients with FM>600 U/ml. In IV pattern, the 5-year DFS rate was 69.5% compared to 87% for patients with no sIL-2R values>600 U/ml during follow-up. sIL-2R values are associated with progression of MM.

The Wf/Wf mutant mouse coat comprises viable and inviable melanoblast clones, seen ultimately as pigmented and white transverse stripes--the latter more prominent. Judging from the pattern, all clones initially expand, and the inviable ones then undergo programmed cell death prenatally. To observe skin melanocytes of the viable clones during extended proliferation, the cells were explanted from individual young mice. An unusually large number of primary explants failed to survive--a result consistent with a growth handicap. In 3 of the 10 surviving cell lines, many cells spontaneously underwent a series of striking changes with the classic features of transformation. The two transformed lines that have been tested by grafting to immunosuppressed hosts formed undifferentiated invasive tumors compatible with malignant amelanotic melanoma. None of our 52 other melanocyte lines of the coisogenic wild-type strain and 13 other natural genotypes have become transformed under the same culture conditions. Molecular analysis of the Wf gene revealed a single change from wild-type: a point mutation affecting the catalytic region in the kinase domain of the Kit protein. The apparent growth disadvantage due to the mutation may allow selection for melanocytes mobilizing more efficient pathways, thus leading to neoplasia. Production of both viable and inviable melanoblast clones is unlikely to be due only to the kinase mutation; possibly the degree, duration, and consistency of expression of this locus may be controlled by cis elements outside the coding region.",

However, melanoma tissue is often rich in melanin that co-purifies with DNA/RNA and inhibits subsequent PCR reactions, hampering tumor antigen detection and amplification. This problem has not yet been addressed systematically. Here we generated a photometric protocol to determine both the melanin and RNA concentration by correcting the latter for the absorption coefficient of melanin at 260 nm. Subsequently, different combinations of silica-based RNA-binding, size-exclusion, and ion-exchange columns were used in 8 protocols for isolation of RNA from melanoma tissue to compare efficacy of melanin removal and yield of RNA. Furthermore, the capability of the different RNA preparations to function as template in RT-PCRs with products of different length, i.e. GAP-DH, tyrosinase, and gp100, was tested. We found that the combination of silica-based RNA-binding and size-exclusion columns was not sufficient to remove melanin from highly contaminated tumor samples, and subsequent RT-PCR failed to give larger products. However, protocols including ion-exchange columns resulted in efficient removal of melanin, while retaining reasonable RNA yields in samples from highly pigmented melanomas. Efficient RT-PCR of larger products turned out to be inversely correlated to the melanin contamination. This RNA-purification method will help scientists to isolate polynucleotides from melanin-containing tumor samples, which subsequently can be used in antigen detection assays and vaccination strategies using amplified total tumor RNA.",

In the present study, we screened for a new surface antigen on SSCs using germline stem (GS) cells (i.e., cultured SSCs). Germ cell transplantation experiments showed that SSCs express melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and mediates cation-independent adhesion. Although MCAM overexpression in GS cells did not influence SSC colony formation frequency or subsequent spermatogenesis after transplantation, MCAM knockdown in GS cells by short-interfering RNA treatment reduced colony numbers, suggesting that MCAM plays a role in sustaining SSC potential. Multiparameter selection of wild-type adult testis cells with a CD9⁺EPCAM(low)MCAM⁺KIT⁻ phenotype resulted in a 561-fold enrichment of SSCs.

We have studied immunohistochemically KIT expression in 23 canine mast cell tumors (MCTs), 10 histiocytomas, 5 malignant melanomas, and in 2 cell lines derived from mast cells (HMC-1, human and C2, canine). As expected, KIT was detected both in the human mast cell leukemia cell line (HMC- ) and in the canine mastocytoma cell line C2. In normal canine skin, KIT expression was confined to mast cells. All canine MCTs expressed KIT, although the intensity of the staining reaction varied considerably among the 23 neoplasms. Grade III tumors showed the highest expression of KIT, whereas grade I tumors showed the lowest expression of KIT. Two patterns of KIT expression were detected in mast cells. In normal canine mast cells and in some neoplastic mast cells, KIT appeared mainly on the cell membrane. However, in many canine MCTs, KIT is accumulated in the cytoplasm, usually near the cell nucleus. The meaning of these two patterns is not clear. Expression of KIT could not be detected immunohistochemically in any of the other neoplasias investigated. According to our results, it can be concluded that most, if not all, canine MCT express KIT. Furthermore, there is an inverse correlation between the degree of differentiation and the expression of KIT. Moreover, according to our results, KIT can be used as a reliable immunohistochemical marker for canine mast cells and undifferentiated mast cell tumors.",

In contrast, human melanoma cells from primary nodular and metastatic lesions grow autonomously partially because of inappropriate production of basic FGF (bFGF) and continuous activation of the bFGF-receptor kinase. Activation of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases in melanocytes stimulates not only proliferation but also the expression of pigmentation. Melanoma cells constitutively express several tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins that in normal melanocytes are stimulated in response to growth factors. This high level of phosphorylation was not due to either the presence of constitutively active Kit kinase and Met kinase nor to the absence of any of several known protein tyrosine phosphatases. Because bFGF by itself does not transform melanocytes to melanomas, there must be additional cooperating factors that confer the malignant phenotype to pigment cells.",

Receptors with tyrosine kinase activity play a critical role in normal melanocyte proliferation and in the uncontrolled growth of melanomas. Normal human melanocytes depend on exogenous peptide growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), or mast cell growth factor (MGF), all of which stimulate receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast, human melanoma cells from primary nodular and metastatic lesions grow autonomously partially because of inappropriate production of bFGF and continuous activation of the bFGF-receptor kinase. Animal models also provide evidence for the importance of receptor-tyrosine kinases in normal melanocyte proliferation and in malignant transformation. In the mouse, genes residing in three loci in which inactivation mutations lead to piebaldism, the dominant spotting (W), patch (Ph), and Sl encode, respectively, the receptor-kinases c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor, and the ligand for c-kit: MGF. In vivo transformation of mouse melanocytes to melanoma, due to constitutive expression of a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, the oncogene ret, was recently demonstrated in transgenic mice. Studies on a fish model, Xiphophorus, in which melanoma is inherited, showed that the dominant tumor inducing gene, Tu, encodes an EGF-receptor related tyrosine kinase which is expressed only in melanomas and not in normal tissues. Taken together, the results suggest that the uncontrolled growth of melanomas is due, in large part, to constitutive activation of receptors with tyrosine kinase activity.",

It should be taken into account that CD117 are also expressed by melanomas, vascular, and some other tumors. The c-kit gene mutations leading to the expression and autoactivation of the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT underlie the oncogenesis of GIST, which results in enhanced proliferative activity and inhibited apoptosis. This is supported by successful chemotherapy for GIST with a KIT receptor inhibitor. The histogenesis of GIST is associated with GIT somatic stem, the Cajal cell precursors. Many GISTs behave like sarcomas and they are characterized by an infiltrating growth, hematogenic (mainly into the liver) and implantational (along the peritoneum) cancer spread.

Because of its central role in melanocyte survival and to assess its potential use as a histopathological marker for melanoma, Mitf expression was examined in histologically confirmed human melanoma specimens. Western blot analysis of melanoma cell lines revealed consistent expression of two Mitf protein isoforms differing by MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation. In a series of 76 consecutive human melanoma surgical specimens, 100% stained positively for Mitf with a nuclear pattern of reactivity. In a side-by-side comparison, Mitf staining was positive in melanomas that failed to stain for either HMB-45 or S-100, the most common currently used melanoma markers. Of 60 non-melanoma tumors, none displayed nuclear Mitf staining and two displayed cytoplasmic staining.

This mutation occurs in most patients with mastocytosis, a myeloproliferative neoplasm, and is detected at lower frequencies in acute myeloid leukemia and in germ cell tumors. Other KIT mutations occur in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and mucosal melanoma. KIT is considered as a bona fide therapeutic target as c-kit mutations are driving oncogenes in these pathologies. However, several evidences suggest that KIT-D816V mutant is not as aggressive as other KIT mutants. Here, we show that an intracellular docking site in the juxtamembrane region of KIT maintains a negative regulation on KIT-D816V transforming potential. Sixteen signaling proteins were shown to interact with this motif. We further demonstrate that mutation of this site results in signaling modifications, altered gene expression profile and increased transforming activity of KIT-D816V mutant. This result was unexpected as mutations of the homologous sites on wild-type (WT) KIT, or on the related oncogenic FLT3-ITD receptor, impair their function. Our results support the hypothesis that, KIT-D816V mutation is a mild oncogenic event that is sufficient to confer partial transforming properties, but requires additional mutations to acquire its full transforming potential.",

This prospective, open-label, phase II study included patients with previously untreated MM or unresectable melanoma. Patients received dacarbazine and bevacizumab until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy variable was the overall response rate. The secondary efficacy parameters included duration of response, duration of stable disease, time to progression/progression-free survival, time to treatment failure and overall survival. The safety analysis included recordings of adverse events and exposure to study treatment. The intention-to-treat population included 37 patients (24 men and 13 women, mean age 54.2±13.1 years). Overall response rate was 18.9% (seven patients achieved a response) and clinical benefit was 48.6%. In patients who achieved a response, the median duration of response was 16.9 months and the median duration of stable disease was 12.5 months.

Survival rates were then determined by a MTT assay, while vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 and -2 expression was measured by flow cytometry and apoptotic cell death rates were investigated using an Annexin assay. Additionally, a commercially available canine VEGF ELISA kit was used to measure VEGF. Radiosensitivity was detected in TLM 1 cells, and mitotic and apoptotic cell death was found to occur in a radiation dose dependent manner. VEGF was secreted constitutively and significant up-regulation was observed in the 8 and 10 Gy irradiated cells. In addition, a minor portion of TLM 1 cells expressed vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 intracellularly. VEGFR-2 was detected in the cytoplasm and was down-regulated following radiation with increasing dosages. In TLM 1 cells, apoptosis plays an important role in radiation induced cell death. It has also been suggested that the significantly higher VEGF production in the 8 and 10 Gy group could lead to tumour resistance. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Availability of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors for specific treatment of GISTs has magnified the importance of accurate differential diagnosis of GIST from other tumors occurring in the GI tract and abdomen. The general problems in this distinction include histological mimicry of other mesenchymal tumors with GIST, occasional KIT-negativity of GIST, and KIT-positivity of non-GISTs. Up to 5% to 10% gastric GISTs and <2% of intestinal GISTs can be KIT-negative. The identification of these tumors as GISTs is based on knowledge of the spectrum of GIST morphology, and can be supported by molecular diagnosis of KIT and PDGFRA mutations (the latter pertain to gastric tumors). True smooth muscle tumors (rare in GI tract except in esophagus and colon) can be separated from GISTs by the eosinophilic tinctorial quality of tumor cells, positivity for smooth muscle markers, and negativity for KIT. Desmoids can form large GIST-like masses, but are composed of spindled or stellate-shaped cells in a densely collagenous stroma. Negativity for KIT and nuclear positivity for beta-catenin are differentiating features. GI schwannomas, melanoma, and rare primary clear cell sarcoma are S100-positive, usually with characteristic histology. The latter two can be KIT-positive. KIT-positive non-GISTs include some sarcomas, especially angiosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, extramedullary myeloid tumor, seminoma, and a few carcinomas, notably small cell carcinoma of lung. Spurious KIT-positivity, seen with some polyclonal KIT antibodies, has been a source of confusion leading to probable false-positive results in fibroblastic tumors and occasional other sarcomas, such as leiomyosarcomas. Integration of histological features with carefully standardized immunohistochemistry, supported by KIT and PDGFRA mutation analysis, is the cornerstone of state-of-the art differential diagnosis of GIST. To comprehensively capture all GISTs, KIT immunostains should be performed on all unclassified epithelioid and mesenchymal tumors of the abdomen. This is a US government work.

SCF synergizes with specific lineage factors in promoting the proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors, and has been administered to expand the pool of these progenitors in cancer patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy. SCF and its c-kit receptor are expressed by some tumor cells, including myeloid leukemia, breast carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma, gynecological tumors, and testicular germ cell tumors. Previous studies of SCF in neuroblastoma have produced conflicting conclusions. To explore the role of SCF in neuroblastoma, we studied five neuroblastoma lines (IMR-5, SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE, AF8, and SJ-N-KP) and the neuroepithelioma line CHP-100. All lines expressed mRNA for c-kit and c-kit protein at low intensity as measured by flow cytometry, and secreted SCF in medium culture as shown by ELISA. Exogenous SCF did not modify 3H thymidine uptake in the neuroblastoma and neuroepithelioma cell lines. After 6 days' culture in the presence of anti-c-kit, the number of viable neuroblastoma cells was significantly lower than the control, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay showed a substantial increase of apoptotic cells: The percentage of positive cells was 1-3% in the control lines, whereas in the presence of anti c-kit it varied from 29% of SK-N-BE to 92% of CHP-100. After 9 days' culture in the presence of anti-c-kit, no viable cells were detectable.

In this model, Transcription Factor Activator Protein 2 alpha (TFAP2A) contributes to melanocyte development by activating expression of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit. Next, ligand-bound Kit stimulates a pathway activating transcription factor Microphthalmia (Mitf), which promotes differentiation and survival of melanocytes by activating expression of Tyrosinase family members, Bcl2, and other genes. The model predicts that in both Tfap2a and Kit null mutants there will be a phenotype of reduced melanocytes and that, because Tfap2a acts upstream of Kit, this phenotype will be more severe, or at least as severe as, in Tfap2a null mutants in comparison to Kit null mutants. Unexpectedly, this is not the case in zebrafish or mouse. Because many Tfap2 family members have identical DNA-binding specificity, we reasoned that another Tfap2 family member may work redundantly with Tfap2a in promoting Kit expression. We report that tfap2e is expressed in melanoblasts and melanophores in zebrafish embryos and that its orthologue, TFAP2E, is expressed in human melanocytes. We provide evidence that Tfap2e functions redundantly with Tfap2a to maintain kita expression in zebrafish embryonic melanophores. Further, we show that, in contrast to in kita mutants where embryonic melanophores appear to differentiate normally, in tfap2a/e doubly-deficient embryonic melanophores are small and under-melanized, although they retain expression of mitfa. Interestingly, forcing expression of mitfa in tfap2a/e doubly-deficient embryos partially restores melanophore differentiation. These findings reveal that Tfap2 activity, mediated redundantly by Tfap2a and Tfap2e, promotes melanophore differentiation in parallel with Mitf by an effector other than Kit. This work illustrates how analysis of single-gene mutants may fail to identify steps in a GRN that are affected by the redundant activity of related proteins.",

In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of the factors that regulate melanocyte development on the stem cells or the precursors of these non-cutaneous melanocytes. In general, a reduction in KIT receptor tyrosine kinase signaling leads to disordered melanocyte development. However, melanocytes in the eye, ear and harderian gland were revealed to be less sensitive to KIT signaling than cutaneous melanocytes. Instead, melanocytes in the eye and harderian gland were stimulated more effectively by endothelin 3 (ET3) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signals than by KIT signaling, and the precursors of these melanocytes expressed the lowest amount of KIT. The growth and differentiation of these non-cutaneous melanocytes were specifically inhibited by antagonists for ET3 and HGF. In transgenic mice induced to express ET3 or HGF in their skin and epithelial tissues from human cytokeratin 14 promoters, the survival and differentiation of non-cutaneous and dermal melanocytes, but not epidermal melanocytes, were enhanced, apparently irrespective of KIT signaling.

Using immunohistochemistry, we tested 40 nevi and primary and metastatic melanoma lesions for the expression of 10 growth factors and cytokines and the respective receptors representing 10 cell surface molecules. Nevi and thin (< 1 mm) primary melanomas showed little expression of ligands except weak reactivity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and reactivity of TGF-betaR and c-kit. Marked up-regulation of growth factors, cytokines and receptor expression was observed in thick (> 1 mm) primary melanomas, which were stained with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) and stem cell factor (SCF), but not IL-2. Metastases showed similar expression patterns except that SCF was absent. Co-expression of ligand and receptor was observed for TGF-beta, GM-CSF and IL-6, suggesting an autocrine role for these ligands. TNF-alpha appears to be a marker of benign lesions; IL-6 and IL-8 expression is associated with biologically early malignancy; TGF-beta, GM-CSF and IL-1alpha are highly expressed in biologically late lesions; and TNF-beta is an apparent marker of metastatic dissemination.

The objective of the present work was to demonstrate intertumour heterogeneity under conditions of microenvironment-induced energy deprivation and to investigate whether the heterogeneity can be attributed to differences in the capacity of the tumour cells to generate energy in an oxygen-deficient microenvironment. Cultures of four human melanoma cell lines (BEX-c, COX-c, SAX-c, WIX-c) were exposed to hypoxia in vitro at pHe 7.4, 7.0 or 6.6 for times up to 31 h by using the steel-chamber method. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to assess adenylate energy charge as a function of exposure time. Cellular rates of glucose uptake and lactate release were determined by using standard enzymatic test kits. The adenylate energy charge decreased with time under hypoxia in all cell lines. The decrease was most pronounced shortly after the treatment had been initiated and then tapered off. BEX-c and SAX-c showed a significantly higher adenylate energy charge under hypoxic conditions than did COX-c and WIX-c whether the pHe was 7.4, 7.0 or 6.6, showing that tumours can differ in the ability to avoid energy deprivation during microenvironmental stress. There was no correlation between the adenylate energy charge and the rates of glucose uptake and lactate release. Intertumour heterogeneity in the ability to withstand energy deprivation in an oxygen-deficient microenvironment cannot therefore be attributed mainly to differences in the capacity of the tumour cells to generate energy by anaerobic metabolism. The data presented here suggest that the heterogeneity is rather caused by differences in the capacity of the tumour cells to reduce the rate of energy consumption when exposed to hypoxia.",

Between the measurements of existing anti-Jo-1 antibody ELISA kit and anti-ARS antibody ELISA kit, the concordance rate of reproducibility is 96.9%, the positive agreement rate is 100%, negative agreement rate is 96.1% and kappa statistic is 0.909. The lung involvement in patients with PM and DM patients are positive of anti-ARS antibodies and anti-melanoma differentiation associated gene5 (MDA5) antibody at a rate around 70%. Then most life-threatening ILD with anti-MDA5 positive clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis patients could be highly guessed when anti-ARS antibodies are negative. ",

The proband's recurrent gastric GIST had a 44,XY-14,-22 karyotype and immunohistochemical evidence of strong diffuse cytoplasmic KIT expression without expression of actin, desmin, or S-100. Immunoblotting showed strong expression of phosphorylated KIT and downstream signaling intermediates (AKT and MAPK) at levels comparable with those reported in sporadic GISTs. cDNA array profiling demonstrated clustering with sporadic GISTs, and expression of GIST markers comparable to sporadic GISTs.;These studies provide the first evidence that gene expression and mechanisms of cytogenetic progression and cell signaling are indistinguishable in familial and sporadic GISTs.

Appearance at birth or later of a nodular or hyperpigmented area within a CMN simulates malignant melanoma and prompts biopsy. Although their clinical and pathologic features seem ominous, proliferative nodules (PNs) typically are benign and may regress, although atypical features cause greater concern. Here we report clinical and pathologic findings with outcome in 10 children who had multiple biopsies of large CMN with PNs. We reviewed 78 separate samples from the 10 patients and classified the 60 PNs according to published criteria. A subset of 30 samples containing both the CMN and a PNs was analyzed for immunohistochemical reactivity for melanocytic (S-100 protein, HMB45, melan-A), lymphocytic (CD45), cell-cycle/proliferative (Mib-1, p16, p21, p27, c-Myc), apoptotic (p53, Bax, c-kit, CD95), and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) markers. Both CMN and PNs had similar expression of melanocytic, lymphocytic, and most cell-cycle/proliferative and apoptotic markers, including Mib-1, p16, p21, p27, c-Myc, Bax, CD95, and bcl-2. A greater proportion of PNs than CMN were reactive for p53 (67% vs. 30%, P < 0.0098) and c-kit (97% vs. 3%, P < 0.0001). p53 and p21 expression in CMN and all types of PNs were inversely correlated. When ordinary and atypical PNs were compared, the atypical PNs more frequently expressed p53, Mib-1, Bax, and bcl-2, but less frequently expressed p21. The c-kit expression in nearly all PNs and its absence in nearly all CMN is potentially useful for recognition of PN, suggests a delayed melanocytic maturation process in proliferative nodules, and may be likely indicative of their benign nature. p53 reactivity in concert with a lack of p21 up-regulation by immunohistochemistry suggests that a p53 mutation may be present in PN, although the immunohistochemical findings alone cannot exclude possible overexpression of wild-type p53. Regressive, involutional, or maturational changes were observed in sequential samples from 4 patients. No patient developed malignant melanoma or another melanocytic nevus-associated malignancy during the follow-up period. These findings underscore the similarities between PNs and the underlying CMN and suggest that maturational, proliferative, and apoptotic processes are involved in their clinical evolution.",

It has activity against platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR-alpha and -beta), and c-kit, the receptor for stem cell factor. We have used a standardized ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay and immunohistochemistry to determine the cytotoxicity of imatinib mesylate in tumor-derived cells from cutaneous and uveal melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Imatinib mesylate was tested at concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 0.0625 micromol/l alone and in combination with a cytotoxic drug (cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel or treosulfan). Imatinib mesylate showed low inhibition (IndexSUM>300) across the range of concentrations tested in this study, with few tumors exhibiting increasing inhibition with increased drug concentration. The median IC90 values for cutaneous and uveal melanoma and ovarian carcinoma were 13.2 micromol/l (4.0-294.3 micromol/l), 12.0 micromol/l (2.0-285.4 micromol/l) and 7.71 micromol/l (6.51-11.02 micromol/l), respectively. Imatinib mesylate potentiated the effect of different cytotoxics in 9% (5/54) of cases and had a negative effect in 13% (7/54) of cases, with no effect in the remainder. No correlation of effect was noted with c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry. The signaling pathways mediated by activation of c-kit or platelet-derived growth factor receptor may act as antiapoptotic survival signals in some cancers and inhibition of these pathways may potentiate the activity of some cytotoxic drugs by inhibiting the survival signal. Growth inhibition, however, may reduce the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs, which tend to target proliferating cells preferentially, and clinical effects are therefore difficult to predict.",

Advantages and limitations of diverse, already established methods, such as (fluorescence) in situ hybridization and mutation analysis, to detect these cytogenetic alterations in melanocytic tumours are described. In addition, the potential value of more novel techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification is pointed out. This review demonstrates that at present cytogenetics has mainly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumours, with an important role for activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in the initiation of melanocytic tumours. Mutations in BRAF (in common naevocellular naevi), NRAS (congenital naevi), HRAS (Spitz naevi) and GNAQ (blue naevi) can all cause MAPK activation. All these mutations seem early events in the development of melanocytic tumours, but by themselves are insufficient to cause progression towards melanoma. Additional molecular alterations are implicated in progression towards melanoma, with different genetic alterations in melanomas at different sites and with varying levels of sun exposure. This genetic heterogeneity in distinct types of naevi and melanomas can be used for the development of molecular tests for diagnostic purposes. However, at the moment only few molecular tests have become of diagnostic value and are performed in daily routine practice. This is caused by lack of large prospective studies on the diagnostic value of molecular tests including follow-up, and by the low prevalence of certain molecular alterations. For the future we foresee an increasing role for cytogenetics in the treatment of melanoma patients with the increasing availability of targeted therapy. Potential targets for metastatic melanoma include genes involved in the MAPK pathway, such as BRAF and RAS. More recently, KIT has emerged as a potential target in melanoma patients. These targeted treatments all need careful evaluation, but might be a promising adjunct for treatment of metastatic melanoma patients, in which other therapies have not brought important survival advantages yet.",

Two independent groups have reported genome-wide association studies identifying variants associated to an increased risk of melanoma. Tumor stem cells were found to have an increased frequency when compared to previously reported studies, and also a greater plasticity. The Merkel cell polyoma virus seems rather ubiquitous, since it has been evidenced, without clonal integration, in several other types of cutaneous tumors, and even in healthy skin, with an increased frequency in photo-exposed skin and in immunodepressed patients. A recent study demonstrates for the first time a link between the exposure to pesticides and the occurrence of lymphomas. Another study has evidenced the association between topical treatments with steroids and the occurrence of lymphomas, especially cutaneous lymphomas. The risk is increased with the length of treatment and the potency of steroids. Adjuvant treatment of high-risk melanomas with alpha interferon does not achieve better results with the adjunction of a 4 weeks high-dose induction period, and development of autoantibodies is not significantly associated to an increased relapse free survival after correction of the time related biais. In contrast, the effect of interferon on relapse free survival, distant metastasis free survival and overall survival seems better in the subgroup of melanoma with primary ulceration. The development of new specific inhibitors of c-kit or BRAF is a great hope for the targeted treatment of peculiar groups of advanced melanomas.

Technetium-99m-sulfur colloid also forms particles and this article reports on the effects different preparation parameters have on its particle size distribution and stability.;Four groups of kits were evaluated, kits which utilized: (a) a reduced heating protocol with a new 99mTc-elution, (b) a reduced heating protocol with an old 99mTc-elution, (c) a prolonged heating protocol with a new 99mTc-elution and (d) a prolonged heating protocol with an old 99mTc-elution. The particle size distribution and the stability of the different 99mTc-sulfur colloid kit preparations were evaluated over 6 hr utilizing polycarbonate filters ranging from 0.03 to 10 microns.;In vitro studies demonstrated no significant change in the particle size distribution over a 6-hr period and all 99mTc-sulfur colloid preparations had a bimodal particle size distribution pattern. Importantly, heating the kit for shorter periods of times utilizing [99mTc]pertechnetate, which had a longer ingrowth of [99mTc]pertechnetate, produced a formulation which had the largest percentage of particles smaller than 0.03 microns.;In our clinical setting, 99mTc-sulfur colloid prepared with the reduced heating protocol and utilizing [99mTc]pertechnetate, which has the highest ingrowth of [99mTc]pertechnetate has proved to be an excellent agent for lymphoscintigraphy studies.

Twenty-eight lesions were conjunctival nevi, of which 20 were excised from children younger than 18 years. Fifteen lesions were conjunctival primary acquired melanosis (PAM; 11 without atypia and 4 with atypia) and five were conjunctival melanomas. To detect the BRAF T1799A mutation, both a newly developed kit (Mutector; TrimGen, Sparks, MD) and direct DNA sequence analysis of exon 15 after PCR amplification were used.;The T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in 14 of 28 (50%) conjunctival nevi analyzed, but in none of the 15 conjunctival PAMs, with and without atypia. The T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in two of the five (40%) conjunctival melanomas. There was no difference in the BRAF mutation detected in conjunctival nevi in children or adults, as the BRAF mutation was detected in 50%.;The results showed that conjunctival nevi, similar to skin nevi, have a high frequency of oncogenic BRAF mutations. Furthermore, the results suggest that the oncogenic event leading to BRAF mutations affect only conjunctival nevi and not conjunctival PAM.

Western blotting was performed in 22 selected cases. HSP90 overexpression was found in 33.7% of GISTs and was correlated with non-gastric location, mixed histological subtype, high mitotic index, high risk grades, and specific mutation genotypes. In mesenchymal tumours, HSP90 overexpression was found in 66.7% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, 83.3% of leiomyosarcomas, and 100% of melanomas. HSP90 expression by Western blotting correlated with the results of immunohistochemistry. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that HSP90 expression is an independent predictor of recurrence in GISTs (P = 0.003).;Overexpression of HSP90 is predictive of adverse behaviour in GISTs and may provide a therapeutic solution to the challenge of imatinib-resistant GISTs and other mesenchymal sarcomas.",

Seminomatous and non-seminomatous components were separately arranged and evaluated on tissue microarrays. MAGEC2 expression was compared with POU5F1 (OCT3/4), SOX2, SOX17, KIT and TNFRSF8 (CD30). The mouse monoclonal anti-MAGEC2 antibody (clone LX-CT10.5) revealed a nuclear MAGEC2 expression with little or no background staining. MAGEC2 expression was found in 238 of 254 seminomas (94%), but not in embryonal carcinomas (n=89). POU5F1 (OCT3/4) was positive in 97% of seminomas and all embryonal carcinomas. In contrast, KIT was positive in 94% of seminoma but also in 8% of embryonal carcinomas. TNFRSF8 (CD30) and SOX2 were negative in seminoma and positive in embryonal carcinoma (96 and 90%, respectively). SOX17 was positive in 94% of seminoma and negative in embryonal carcinoma.

Three tumors were positive for CD68 (KP-1), a histiocyte marker, and each of the following markers was positive in two cases: desmin, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, and S-100 protein. All tumors tested were negative for chromogranin A, CD15 (Leu-M1), myoglobin, neurofilament protein, alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and melanoma-associated antigen (HMB-45 antibody). Immunoreactivity for cytokeratins was usually focal, paranuclear, and globoid, while reactivity for actin and vimentin was diffuse and cytoplasmic. Based on these findings, melanomas and some carcinomas should be distinguishable from lipid cell tumors. However, the immunohistochemical profiles of smooth-muscle tumors, other gonadal stromal tumors (granulosa cell tumors, thecomas), and hepatocellular, renal cell, and adrenocortical carcinomas overlap with that of lipid cell tumors, and therefore these tumors may not be distinguishable from lipid cell tumors using this technique.

The hypothesis is supported by data from the literature reporting that both PEComas and GISTs, as well as telocytes, share the expression of several markers. These data were supplemented by original immunohistochemical tests on selected series. Specifically: (1) Melanoma markers (Melan A, MiTF) typical of PEComas are expressed by a substantial fraction of GISTs. A fraction of GISTs was also found positive for CD63, a tetraspanin protein originally described in melanomas and marking exosomes. (2) c-KIT (CD117), proper of the vast majority of GISTs, can be expressed by PEComas (as well as by telocytes). (3) Markers described in telocytes (CD34, S-100, smooth muscle actin and vascular endothelial growth factor) have been reported as positive in cases of PEComas and GISTs. Telocytes show distinctive ultrastructural features with thin, extended, telopodes and are likely involved in inter-cellular signalling via paracrine secretion as well as by shed vesicles and exosomes. These cells have been described in many locations (cavitary and non-cavitary organs) and might display potentialities of a wide spectrum of differentiation (and function). In conclusion we propose that telocytes could be the common cells of origin for both PEComas and GISTs.",

Search for new biological markers is important for diagnosis and prognosis in eye tumors. Cystatin C, an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, plays an important protective role in several tumors. Lactoferrin was shown to express anti-tumor and antiviral activities. It was hypothesized that cystatin C and lactoferrin could serve as possible biomarkers in the diagnosis of malignant and benign eye tumors.;A total of 54 patients with choroidal melanoma and benign eye tumors were examined (part of them undergoing surgical treatment). Serum, tear fluid and intraocular fluid samples obtained from the anterior chamber of eyes in patients with choroidal melanoma were studied.;Cystatin C concentration in serum and eye biological fluids was measured by commercial ELISA kits for human (BioVendor, Czechia); lactoferrin concentration--by Lactoferrin-strip D 4106 ELISA test systems (Vector-BEST, Novosibirsk Region, Russia).;Cystatin C concentration in serum of healthy persons was significantly higher as compared to tear and intraocular fluids. In patients with choroidal melanoma, increased cystatin C concentration was similar in tear fluid of both the eyes. Lactoferrin level in tear fluid of healthy persons was significantly higher than its serum level. Significantly increased lactoferrin concentration in tear fluid was noted in patients with benign and malignant eye tumors.;Increased level of cystatin C in tear fluid seems to be a possible diagnostic factor in the eye tumors studied.

These novel targeted agents have demonstrated activity against a wide range of solid tumors, are generally better tolerated than standard chemotherapeutics, and may revolutionize the management of advanced refractory cancer. The ubiquitous Raf serine/threonine kinases are pivotal molecules within the Raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation and survival. Raf kinase isoforms (wild-type Raf-1 or the b-raf V600E oncogene) are overactivated in a variety of solid tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. In this review, the role of Raf in normal cells and in cancer is discussed, and an overview is given of Raf inhibitors currently in development, focusing on sorafenib tosylate (BAY 43-9006 or sorafenib). Sorafenib is the first oral multi-kinase inhibitor to be developed that targets Raf kinases (Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf, and b-raf V600E), in addition to receptor tyrosine kinases associated with angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]-2/-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR]-beta) or tumor progression (Flt-3, c-kit).

Mast cells are abundant surrounding solid tumors where they are often protumorigenic and enhance tumor angiogenesis. However, antitumor roles for mast cells have also been documented. The impact of mast cells may be dependent on their activation status and mediator release in different tumors. Using an orthotopic melanoma model in wild-type C57BL/6 and mast cell-deficient Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice and a complementary Matrigel-tumor model in C57BL/6 mice, mast cells were shown to be crucial for TLR2 agonist (Pam(3)CSK(4))-induced tumor inhibition. Activation of TLR2 on mast cells reversed their well-documented protumorigenic role. Tumor growth inhibition after peritumoral administration of Pam(3)CSK(4) was restored in Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice by local reconstitution with wild-type, but not TLR2-deficient, mast cells. Mast cells secrete multiple mediators after Pam(3)CSK(4) activation, and in vivo mast cell reconstitution studies also revealed that tumor growth inhibition required mast cell-derived IL-6, but not TNF. Mast cell-mediated anticancer properties were multifaceted. Direct antitumor effects in vitro and decreased angiogenesis and recruitment of NK and T cells in vivo were observed. TLR2-activated mast cells also inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells in vivo. Unlike other immune cells, mast cells are relatively radioresistant making them attractive candidates for combined treatment modalities. This study has important implications for the design of immunotherapeutic strategies and reveals, to our knowledge, a novel mechanism of action for TLR2 agonists in vivo.",

Because of the requirement of high cell amounts for the generation of cartilage implants or for the extensive experimental studies to investigate the culture parameters, the initial cells have to be expanded, which leads to high population doubling numbers. It is known that hMSC can differentiate into chondrocytes at least up to the 15th population doubling. To monitor the differentiation status, the protein MIA (melanoma inhibitory activity), which is only synthesized by malignant melanomas and chondrocytes, can be used. In this study the chondrogenic differentiation potential of hMSC beyond the 15th population doubling was investigated using MIA as a chondrocyte marker. A chondrogenic potential of hMSC at higher population doubling numbers may be of interest due to the requirement of less frequent isolations of cells. Therefore hMSC were cultured in a monolayer until the 37th population doubling. Cells of different passages were cultured as pellets for two weeks in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta3 containing differentiation medium. The MIA contents in medium on the last three cultivation days were measured for each case using an MIA-ELISA-kit. A significant difference between MIA content in medium of the pellet and nonstimulated monolayer reference cultures was detectable until the 32nd population doubling. In addition, the hMSC were seeded at lower densities to investigate whether the cells may be expanded faster and with less amount of work due to higher population doubling numbers per passage.

Rather than focusing on heparanase activity, then, we have developed a rapid, alternative colorimetric heparinase assay, on the basis of the recent finding that sulfated disaccharides generated from heparin by bacterial heparinase exhibit biological properties comparable to those from heparan sulfate by mammalian heparanase. In this study, the concentrations of porcine heparin and bacterial heparinase I were determined using a Sigma Diagnostics Kit. Morus alba was selected as a candidate through this assay system, and an inhibitor, resveratrol, was purified from its methanol extract. Its anti-metastatic effects on the pulmonary metastasis of murine B16 melanoma cells were also evaluated. Our findings suggest that this assay may prove useful as a diagnostic tool for heparinase inhibition, as an alternative anti-metastatic target.",

In this study, levels of DJ-1 secreted into the serum of healthy controls and patients with sporadic PD were examined by using a DJ-1 ELISA kit, and the level of oxidative stress in the serum was also measured. The results showed that DJ-1 was secreted into the serum of both healthy controls and PD patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"During the last two decades, novel nonclonogenic methods for pretherapeutic chemosensitivity testing have been developed that are likely to overcome major technical limitations of older assays such as low evaluability rates, low degree of standardization and reproducibility, lack of technical robustness, and poor methodological efficacy. Among these, the microplate adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-based tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) has gained particular merits for ex vivo chemosensitivity testing of native nonhematological tumors including cancers of the breast, ovary, gastrointestinal tract, cervix and corpus uteri, and lung; malignant melanomas; gliomas; sarcomas; and mesotheliomas. For this indication, the ATP-TCA can now be considered the best documented and validated technology. This assay, which is now commercially available, provides a highly reproducible, easy-to-handle kit technique; low technical failure rates; and a high methodological efficacy requiring only 1 x 106 tumor cells to test four to six different drugs or combinations. In ovarian and breast carcinomas, the predictive accuracy is > 90%, with a positive predictive value of 85-90% and a negative predictive value near 100%, respectively. In primary ovarian cancers, the ATP-TCA has been found to accurately predict both clinical response and survival. In two prospective clinical trials in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, chemotherapy individually selected by the ATP-TCA has been found to triple the response rates and nearly double the survival compared to empirically chosen regimens. Consequently, this assay, which is now under phase III evaluation, has successfully been used in new agent development to screen for novel chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of patients with breast and ovarian carcinoma and melanoma, respectively. This chapter highlights the recent preclinical and clinical experience with this promising technology and gives a detailed description of all the technical aspects of the ATP-TCA.",

Triptolide, a major active component isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii, has been proven to possess multiple antitumor activities. Here, we investigated the effect of triptolide on regulatory T cells and on the level of IL-10, transforming growth factor-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor-bearing mice. Fifty male C57BL/6 mice were randomly grouped as follows: normal control group, model group with B16-F10 cells implanted, and three treatment groups with cyclophosphamide, triptolide-high dose, triptolide-low dose. The proportion of regulatory T cells in the spleen and axillary lymph nodes was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. Production of cytokines IL-10, transforming growth factor-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor in serum was measured using enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay kits. The mRNA levels of Foxp3, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-β in the spleen and vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor tissue were detected by real-time PCR. The results showed that triptolide significantly decreased the proportion of regulatory T cells and lowered the Foxp3 level in the spleen and axillary lymph nodes of tumor-bearing mice. Production of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β in peripheral blood, and the mRNA level of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β in the spleen were also decreased. Additionally, triptolide could remarkably inhibit production of vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that triptolide might inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting regulatory T cells and some cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β, as well as production of vascular endothelial growth factor.

Further, among such metastatic tumors, the metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the stomach is an extremely rare disease, and it is usually reported in autopsy series. We report a rare case of metastatic gastric tumor derived from right renal carcinoma. Gastric endoscopy confirmed a large, polypoid, friable mass (type 1 tumor, about 7 cm in diameter) in the middle part of the stomach body. The mass was surgically excised and pathological examination showed that the gastric tumor was derived from a metastasis from the right kidney, because it was composed of malignant cells that were identical to those from the removed RCC. In addition, the tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD10, CD15, Ecadherin, early membrane antigen (EMA), and vimentin, but no reactivity was observed for cytokeratins 7 and 20 or c-KIT. Although gastric metastatic tumor derived from renal carcinoma is rare, the precise pre- and postoperative diagnosis may be important; thus, investigation for such metastatic tumors should be performed routinely in the follow up of patients who have been treated for RCC.",

Twelve of the studied compounds showed moderate cytotoxicity, with selectivity against K562 but not the remaining two cancer cell lines. Four compounds were not active in cytotoxicity assays, presumably due to high predicted lipophilicity and low solubility. To rationalize the observed cytotoxic effects, structure-based virtual screening was carried out against a pool of potential targets constructed using the inverse docking program Tarfisdock and bibliographical references. The putative targets were identified on the basis of the best correlation between docking scores and in vitro cytotoxicity. It is proposed that the mechanism of action of the studied aminopyridines involves the disruption of signaling pathways and cancer cell cycle through the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases and several tyrosine kinases, namely Bcr-Abl kinase and KIT receptor kinase. The obtained results can guide further structural modifications of the studied compounds aimed at developing selective agents targeting proteins involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation.",

Furthermore, there was no difference observed between histologic tumor type with regard to serum ICAM-1 concentration.

A plain computed tomography scan showed a round osteolytic lesion in the right 6th rib. The resected tissue contained a globular-shaped, soft tumor. Histologically, the tumor was rich in vasculature and exclusively composed of perivascular epithelioid cells with clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor expressed diffusely a melanocyte marker, human melanoma black-45, and focally a myogenic marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin, but not an epithelial marker, AE1/AE3. Fontana-Masson-positive melanin pigments were present and c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (CD117), involved in the development of melanocytes but not myogenic cells, was expressed in tumor cells. These findings indicate that the tumor is PEComa with some differentiation into melanocytes. Notably, owing to the unique location of the occurrence, the tumor occupied bone marrow tissues of the rib, resulting that the tumor has the potential for hematogenous metastasis. In spite of the lack of cells with severe atypia, necrosis, and numerous mitoses, tumor cells invaded into surrounding tissues and overexpressed cyclin D1.

The lamella terminates in ruffling lamellipodia that face the direction of migration. Although the role of actin in the formation of lamellipodia is well established, it remains unclear to what degree microtubules contribute to this process. Herein, we have studied the contribution of microtubules to cell motility by time-lapse video microscopy on green flourescence protein-actin- and tubulin-green fluorescence protein-transfected melanoma cells. Treatment of cells with either the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole or with the stabilizing agent taxol showed decreased ruffling and lamellipodium formation. However, this was not due to an intrinsic inability to form ruffles and lamellipodia because both were restored by stimulation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in a Rac-dependent manner, and by stem cell factor in melanoblasts expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit. Although ruffling and lamellipodia were formed without microtubules, the microtubular network was needed for advancement of the cell body and the subsequent retraction of the tail. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the formation of lamellipodia can occur via actin polymerization independently of microtubules, but that microtubules are required for cell migration, tail retraction, and modulation of cell adhesion.",

Through extensive molecular analysis the precise genetic content of the AZFc region and the origin of its deletion have been determined. However, little is known about the effect of AZFc deletions on the functionality of germ cells at various developmental steps. The presence of normal, fertilization-competent sperm in the ejaculate and/or testis of the majority of men with AZFc deletions suggests that the process of differentiation from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) to mature spermatozoa can take place in the absence of the AZFc region. To determine the functionality of AZFc-deleted spermatogonia, we compared in vitro propagated spermatogonia from six men with complete AZFc deletions with spermatogonia from three normozoospermic controls. We found that spermatogonia of AZFc-deleted men behave similar to controls during culture. Short-term (18 days) and long-term (48 days) culture of AZFc-deleted spermatogonia showed the same characteristics as non-deleted spermatogonia. This similarity was revealed by the same number of passages, the same germ cell clusters formation and similar level of genes expression of spermatogonial markers including ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha 1 (GFRA1), as well as germ cell differentiation markers including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), spermatogenesis and oogenesis specific basic helix-loophelix 2 (SOHLH2), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) and synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3). The only exception was melanoma antigen family A4 (MAGEA4) which showed significantly lower expression in AZFc-deleted samples than controls in short-term culture while in long-term culture it was hardly detected in both AZFc-deleted and control spermatogonia. These data suggest that, at least in vitro, spermatogonia of AZFc-deleted men are functionally similar to spermatogonia from non-deleted men. Potentially, this enables treatment of men with AZFc deletions by propagating their SSCs in vitro and autotransplanting these SSCs back to the testes to increase sperm counts and restore fertility.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cucurbitacin I (CBI) is a triterpene from a bitter melon called Goya grown in Okinawa, Japan, and directly inhibits both the Tyr-kinase JAK2 and the G protein RAC, leading to the inactivation of PAK1 (RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1). Bio 30, a propolis produced in New Zealand, contains CAPE (caffeic acid phenethyl ester) as the major anti-cancer ingredient which directly down-regulates RAC, leading to the inactivation of PAK1. Since PAK1 is essential for the growth of RAS cancer cells such as A549 cell line which carry an oncogenic K-RAS mutant, and the melanogenesis in skin cells, here using these PAK1-blockers as model compounds, we introduce a new approach to the quick assessment of PAK1-blockers in cell culture. First, combining the immuno-precipitation (IP) of PAK1 from cell lysate and the in vitro ATP_Glo kinase assay kit (called \"Macaroni-Western\" assay), we confirmed that both CBI and Bio 30 inactivate PAK1 in A549 lung cancer cells in 24 h, and inhibit their PAK1-dependent growth in 72 h. Furthermore, we verified that CBI inhibits the PAK1/PAK4-dependent melanogenesis in melanoma cells by far more than 50%, while Bio 30 inhibits the melanogenesis only by 50%, with only a merginal effect on their growth per se. Since the \"Macaroni-Western\" kinase assay and melanogenesis are both rather simple and quick, the combination of these two cell culture assays would be highly useful for selecting both \"potent\" (highly cell-permeable) and \"safe\" (non-toxic) natural or synthetic PAK1-blockers.

As several malignant tumors lead to impaired blood coagulation, we hypothesized if kisspeptin acts also as a potential anticoagulant. The effect was studied in vivo through intraperitoneal administration of kisspeptin to laboratory rats, and application of kisspeptin ex vivo to rat and human blood. In another set of experiments, clotting factors in the form of rat fresh plasma were injected into rats' prior to kisspeptin administration. Standard anticoagulation parameters were studied through established methods and commercially available kits. Herein, we demonstrate dose-dependent anticoagulation effect following in vivo kisspeptin administration. Coagulation time, bleeding time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were significantly (P < 0.0002) prolonged, international normalized ratio increased, while plasma calcium concentration and mean platelet count were significantly decreased (P < 0.001). Mean platelet volume increased only at the highest tested dose while platelet distribution width remained unaltered. Where fresh plasma was administered prior to kisspeptin treatment, results were similar to kisspeptin alone treatment except for significantly (P < 0.001) increased plasma calcium concentration. Application of kisspeptin ex vivo to rat and human blood produced similar results. This is the first report on kisspeptin's role in the anticoagulation of blood and suggests that it may increase the bleeding tendency possibly via modulation of calcium-signaling or inactivating calcium action, inhibition of thrombin and quick reduction in platelet numbers. A detailed investigation of the anticoagulation role of kisspeptin would help to clarify its use as an anticoagulant and thrombolytic agent.",

Here we use an unbiased screen of bone marrow (BM) cells to identify cells which localize to tumors and which might serve as effective candidate cell carriers without any prior prediction or selection.;Unsorted BM cells from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic donor mice were adoptively transferred into C57Bl/6 mice bearing pre-established subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumors. Forty-eight hours and eight days later, tumors, organs and blood were analyzed for GFP-expressing cells by flow cytometry. The phenotype of GFP cells in organs was determined by co-staining with specific cell surface markers.;CD45(+) hematopoietic cells were readily detected in tumor, spleen, bone marrow, blood and lung at both time points. Within these CD45(+) cell populations, preferential accumulation in the tumor was observed of cells expressing Sca-1, c-kit, NK1.1, Thy1.2, CD14, Mac-3 and/or CD11c. Lymphodepletion increased homing to spleen and bone marrow, but not to tumors.;We have used an in vivo screen to identify populations of BM-derived donor cells which accumulate within tumors.

In an attempt to find a novel anti-melanogenic agent, we synthesized (Z)-5-(2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione (MHY498). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of MHY498 on NO levels and on the NO-mediated signaling pathway using an in vitro model of melanogenesis. MHY498 inhibited 200 μM sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor)-induced NO generation, dose-dependently and suppressed tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis induced by SNP in B16F10 melanoma cells. To investigate the effect of MHY498 on NO-mediated signaling pathway, guanosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) activities were measured using a cGMP EIA Kit and western blotting was performed to determine the effects of MHY498 on the gene expressions of tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). The increased activity of cGMP by SNP was reduced dose-dependently by pretreatment with MHY498. Furthermore, MHY498 suppressed the expressions of tyrosinase and MITF stimulated by SNP. This study shows that enhancement of tyrosinase gene expression via the cGMP pathway is a probable primary mechanism of NO-induced melanogenesis and that the NO-mediated signaling pathway with the expression of MITF enhances melanogenesis. In addition, MHY498 was found to scavenge NO and to suppress the activity of the NO-mediated signaling pathway, and thus, to subsequently down-regulate tyrosinase expression and melanogenesis. This study suggests that MHY498 is a promising anti-melanogenic agent that targets the NO-induced cGMP signaling pathway.",

Among the most sensitive dasatinib targets are ABL, the SRC family kinases (SRC, LCK, HCK, FYN, YES, FGR, BLK, LYN, and FRK), and the receptor tyrosine kinases c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β, discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), c-FMS, and ephrin receptors. Dasatinib inhibits cell duplication, migration, and invasion, and it triggers apoptosis of tumoral cells. As a consequence, dasatinib reduces tumoral mass and decreases the metastatic dissemination of tumoral cells. Dasatinib also acts on the tumoral microenvironment, which is particularly important in the bone, where dasatinib inhibits osteoclastic activity and favors osteogenesis, exerting a bone-protecting effect. Several preclinical studies have shown that dasatinib potentiates the antitumoral action of various drugs used in the oncology clinic, paving the way for the initiation of clinical trials of dasatinib in combination with standard-of-care treatments for the therapy of various neoplasias. Trials using combinations of dasatinib with ErbB/HER receptor antagonists are being explored in breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers. In hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, trials using combinations of dasatinib with antihormonal therapies are ongoing. Dasatinib combinations with chemotherapeutic agents are also under development in prostate cancer (dasatinib plus docetaxel), melanoma (dasatinib plus dacarbazine), and colorectal cancer (dasatinib plus oxaliplatin plus capecitabine).

These tumors are both phenotypically and genotypically different from true leiomyomas and usually express CD34, a hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen. CD34, however, is also present in a wide variety of fibroblastic and endothelial cell tumors. In this immunohistochemical study of CD117, we evaluated 85 cases of GIST and more than 150 other mesenchymal tumors, including leiomyomas and schwannomas. CD117, the c-kit proto-oncogene product, is expressed in subsets of hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells, melanocytes, and interstitial cells of Cajal of the GI tract. CD117 was almost always (85%) expressed in both benign and malignant GISTs. CD117 was observed both in the spindle cell and epithelioid subtypes of GISTs in all locations. In addition to reacting with the CD34-positive GISTs, CD117 was positive in some CD34-negative cases. Approximately one-third of GISTs coexpressed CD117 and smooth muscle actins. In contrast, true leiomyomas (desmin and actin-positive) and schwannomas in both GI and peripheral locations were consistently negative for CD117. Solitary fibrous tumors and Kaposi's sarcomas, which are typically CD34 positive, were consistently CD117 negative. Among the CD34-positive tumors that showed occasional CD117 reactivity were dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (1 of 7) and hemangiopericytoma (2 of 10). Other mesenchymal tumors that were variably CD 117 positive included clear cell sarcoma (7 of 15), metastatic melanoma (9 of 25), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1 of 20). These results indicate that CD117 is a specific marker for GIST among tumors that occur in the GI tract and adjacent regions. CD117 expression also separates GISTs from true leiomyomas and gastric schwannomas.",

The current work is devoted to explore both the biological activity of some previously obtained compounds and the search for an explanation of their target(s) in hypoxic pathways. In this work the biological activity of some benzimidazole-4,7-diones was evaluated. These compounds were examined as potential bioreductive agents specific for the hypoxic environment found in tumor cells. The main aim was concerned with establishing their cytotoxic properties by using proliferation, apoptosis and DNA destruction tests on selected tumor cells. Their cytotoxic effects on two tumor cell lines (human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells line and human malignant melanoma WM115) was compared by means of a WST-1 test. Next, the mode of cytotoxicity behind the selected tumor cells' death was determined by the caspase 3/7 test. The last point referred to the DNA destruction of A549 and WM115 cells and the in situ DNA Assay Kit test was applied. The cytotoxic tests confirmed their activity against the tumor cells and target hypoxia (compounds 2b, 2a, 2d). The screening test of the caspase-dependent apoptosis proved that the exposure of the tested tumor cells in hypoxia to these benzimidazole-4,7-diones promoted the apoptotic cell death. Additionally, the DNA damage test established that benzimidazole-4,7-diones can be potential hypoxia-selective agents for tumor cells, especially compound 2b. All results classify the tested benzimidazole-4,7-diones as promising, lead molecules and provide a rationale for further molecular studies to explain their usefulness as potential inhibitors of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1).

We hypothesized that hypomelanosis in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides may have a similar mechanism as in vitiligo, a condition in which it is believed that alterations in expression of CD117 (stem cell factor receptor/KIT protein) on epidermal melanocytes and abnormal interactions between melanocytes and surrounding keratinocytes may play a pathogenic role. To test the hypothesis that similar mechanisms might also explain hypopigmentation in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides, skin specimens from five cases each of hypopigmented mycosis fungoides and vitiligo were studied immunohistochemically for immunophenotype of the infiltrating cells, CD117 (expressed by epidermal melanocytes), and pan melanoma cocktail of antigens (gp100, tyrosinase, and MART-1) expression; cases of conventional mycosis fungoides and normal skin were studied in parallel as controls. Our findings confirm a predominance of CD8+ neoplastic T cells in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides. Similarly, the epidermal lymphocytic infiltrate in vitiligo was also composed of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, in contrast to an epidermal infiltrate composed of CD4+ T cells in conventional mycosis fungoides. The average number of epidermal CD117 expressing cells followed the same pattern of decreased expression in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides as in vitiligo, whereas the levels in conventional mycosis fungoides were higher, and similar to that observed in normal skin. Furthermore, a decreased number of melanocytes per high-power field of the length of the biopsy was present in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides and vitiligo, as compared with either conventional mycosis fungoides or normal skin, suggesting a correlation between decreased expression of CD117 and decreased number of melanocytes. We propose that decreased expression of CD117 and its downstream events in melanocytes may be initiated by cytotoxic effects of melanosomal-antigen-specific CD8+ neoplastic T lymphocytes, resulting in destabilization of CD117 and leading to dysfunction and/or loss of melanocytes in the epidermis of hypopigmented mycosis fungoides.",

To correctly classify a tumour process, it is essential not only to define its histological typology and identify its biological character but, at the same time, using immunohistochemistry and diagnostic molecular pathology, to evaluate prognostic and predictive indicators. As regards the prognostic indicators, it is mainly grading and staging as part of the TNM system, the sentinel lymph node assessment, if it is assessed, and other nodes extracted in this context. Histological specimens of invasive carcinomas and skin melanomas are assessed with respect to the depth of the invasion. Endocrine oestrogen and progesterone receptors are assessed in endocrine-dependent breast carcinomas. Predictive pathology uses biomarkers; biomarkers confirm the presence of target molecules following their reaction with the administered small molecule-like drugs, usually protein kinases or antibodies. HER2 gene amplification is estimated using the FISH method and predicts effectiveness of breast cancer therapies. In patients with a colon carcinoma, HER1 oncogene is identified immunohistochemically and the presence of a mutated K-ras is subsequently tested using the RT-PCR technique. CD 117 (c-kit) expression is determined in gastrointestinal stromal tumour and CD 20, 33 and 52 in malignant lymphomas and leukaemias. The most difficult task for a pathologist is defining the primary focus of the tumour in cases where only a fraction of a metastasis is available for examination. Nevertheless, at present, it is feasible to track the tumour differentiation down and, using an antibody battery, particularly against specific cytokeratines and vimentine and including organ-specific markers, to identify the primary source or at least to establish an assumption about the most likely organ affected by the tumour process.",

Although only 2 years have passed many new facts and stimulating developments have happened in diagnostic molecular pathology rendering it worthwhile to present an up-date on this topic. A major technical improvement is certainly given by the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS; amplicon, whole exome, whole genome) and its application to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in routine diagnostics. Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs. In the near future this will open new strategies to apply 'off-label' targeted therapies, e.g. for rare tumors, otherwise resistant tumors etc. The clinically relevant genetic aberrations described in this review include mutation analyses of RAS (KRAS and NRAS), BRAF and PI3K in colorectal cancer, KIT or PDGFR alpha as well as BRAF, NRAS and KIT in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we present several recent advances in the molecular characterization of malignant lymphoma. Beside the well-known mutations in NSCLC (EGFR, ALK) a number of chromosomal aberrations (KRAS, ROS1, MET) have become relevant. Only very recently has the clinical need for analysis of BRCA1/2 come up and proven as a true challenge for routine diagnostics because of the genes' special structure and hot-spot-free mutational distribution. The genetic alterations are discussed in connection with their increasingly important role in companion diagnostics to apply targeted drugs as efficient as possible. As another aspect of the increasing number of druggable mutations, we discuss the challenges personalized therapies pose for the design of clinical studies to prove optimal efficacy particularly with respect to combination therapies of multiple targeted drugs and conventional chemotherapy. Such combinations would lead to an extremely high complexity that would hardly be manageable by applying conventional study designs for approval, e.g. by the FDA or EMA. Up-coming challenges such as the application of methylation assays and proteomic analyses on FFPE tissue will also be discussed briefly to open the door towards the ultimate goal of reading a patients' tissue as 'deeply' as possible. Although it is yet to be shown, which levels of biological information are most informative for predictive pathology, an integrated molecular characterization of tumors will likely offer the most comprehensive view for individualized therapy approaches. To optimize cancer treatment we need to understand tumor biology in much more detail on morphological, genetic, proteomic as well as epigenetic grounds. Finally, the complex challenges on the level of drug design, molecular diagnostics, and clinical trials make necessary a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies.

        "Doc_abstract":"In bone metastatic lesions, osteoclasts play a key role in the development of osteolysis. Previous studies have shown that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is important for the differentiation of osteoclasts. In this study, we investigated whether an inhibitor of M-CSF receptor (c-Fms) suppresses osteoclast-dependent osteolysis in bone metastatic lesions. We developed small molecule inhibitors against ligand-dependent phosphorylation of c-Fms and examined the effects of these compounds on osteolytic bone destruction in a bone metastasis model. We discovered a novel quinoline-urea derivative, Ki20227 (N-{4-[(6,7-dimethoxy-4-quinolyl)oxy]-2-methoxyphenyl}-N'-[1-(1,3-thiazole-2-yl)ethyl]urea), which is a c-Fms tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The IC(50)s of Ki20227 to inhibit c-Fms, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (KDR), stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta were found to be 2, 12, 451, and 217 nmol/L, respectively. Ki20227 did not inhibit other kinases tested, such as fms-like tyrosine kinase-3, epidermal growth factor receptor, or c-Src (c-src proto-oncogene product). Ki20227 was also found to inhibit the M-CSF-dependent growth of M-NFS-60 cells but not the M-CSF-independent growth of A375 human melanoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, in an osteoclast-like cell formation assay using mouse bone marrow cells, Ki20227 inhibited the development of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like cells in a dose-dependent manner. In in vivo studies, oral administration of Ki20227 suppressed osteoclast-like cell accumulation and bone resorption induced by metastatic tumor cells in nude rats following intracardiac injection of A375 cells. Moreover, Ki20227 decreased the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like cells on bone surfaces in ovariectomized (ovx) rats. These findings suggest that Ki20227 inhibits osteolytic bone destruction through the suppression of M-CSF-induced osteoclast accumulation in vivo. Therefore, Ki20227 may be a useful therapeutic agent for osteolytic disease associated with bone metastasis and other bone diseases.",

An additional goal was to study the effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).;The expression of TLR-3, TLR-7, RIG-I, and MDA5 in cultured FLS was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Transcription factors were studied using the ELISA-based TransAM transcription factor kit. The expression of IFNβ, CXCL8 (interleukin-8), and MMP-3 was analyzed by RT-PCR and ELISA.;FLS expressed TLR-3, TLR-7, RIG-I, and MDA5. The expression of TLR-3 and RIG-I was higher in RA FLS, while the expression of TLR-7 and MDA5 was higher in OA FLS. Stimulation with poly(I-C) induced the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), NF-κB, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) c-Jun as well as the subsequent production of IFNβ, CXCL8, and MMP-3. VIP reduced the activation of IRF-3 and the production of IFNβ in both OA and RA FLS. Imiquimod induced the activation of NF-κB, AP-1 c-Fos, and AP-1 c-Jun and the synthesis of CXCL8 and MMP-3. VIP significantly diminished MMP-3 production only in imiquimod-treated RA FLS.;The results of this study revealed a prominent function of FLS in the recognition of both dsRNA and ssRNA, which may be present in the joint microenvironment. This study also advances the healing function of the endogenous neuroimmune peptide VIP, which inhibited TLR-3-, RIG-I-, MDA5-, and TLR-7-mediated stimulation of antiviral, proinflammatory, and joint destruction mediators.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The aim of this trial was to measure the pH value of the skin of burn patients using a non-invasive method, from the acute phase through to complete re-epithelialization. The research was then completed by treating the patients with new materials and innovative methods to verify whether this had an effect on the skin pH and on re-epithelialization time. In this clinical trial, the patients were medicated repeatedly with hydrogel (Burnshield®) kept in place by a transparent, semipermeable adhesive film with a moisture vapour transmission rate equivalent to 1600 until day 5 or 6 post-burn. In one patient, treated silk (DermaSilk®) was applied several times until re-epithelialization; in another patient, synthetic hyaluronic acid (Hyalomatrix®) was applied. Various studies using Dermasilk® have confirmed that the fibroin in silk stimulates re-epithelialization, in addition to keeping the burned skin disinfected, thanks to the antimicrobial agent contained in the treated silk. Hyalomatrix® was used on the other patient, as in other studies, as a temporary substitute for the skin in deep burns. Late complications (keloids and hypertrophic scars) can give rise, even after prolonged periods of time, to Marjolin's ulcer (carcinoma but also melanoma and sarcoma), which can develop in the course of a year. A recent Danish trial affirms that appropriate burn treatment facilitates re-epithelialization and decreases the incidence of Marjolin's ulcer. For the trial, we used a centimetre-wide strip of reactive paper sensitive to pH variations and an acid test (Duotest® kit) as a reference, applied for more than one minute on the patient's burned and slightly damp skin. We performed control procedures on the patient's normal skin, away from the wound site. The pH was measured from day 1 post-burn and every other day thereafter until complete re-epithelialization. We found alkaline pH values for the burned skin from the day of the burn until day 12, with an alkaline pH peak on day 4 (10.5 in the first patient, 9.5 in the second). The values then gradually returned to normal (pH, 5.5) from day 13 onwards. The mean re-epithelialization time was similar in the two patients, equivalent to 24.5 days (25 days in the first patient, 24 in the second), with a mean follow-up of 21 months (33 months in the first case, 9 in the second). No early or late complications were observed.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Adult-type fibrosarcoma (FS) was once considered the most common adult sarcoma, but is now considered a diagnosis of exclusion. No recent series has critically reevaluated putative FSs to estimate their true incidence. One hundred ninety-five cases diagnosed as adult FS in somatic soft tissue were retrieved from our institutional archives for the period 1960 to 2008. Thirty-two cases with insufficient material were excluded. On the basis the morphology of the final 163 cases, immunohistochemical studies (IHC) was conducted using some combination of: wide-spectrum cytokeratin (CK), EMA, high molecular weight CK, S100, Melan A, HMB-45, CD34, TLE1, CD31, HHV8, smooth muscle actin, desmin, ALK1, CD99, Myo-D1, myogenin, c-kit, INI1, CD21, p63, calretinin, WT1, and TTF1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for SYT gene rearrangement was done in 6 putative CK-negative synovial sarcomas (SS). Revised diagnoses were based on clinical, morphologic, IHC, and molecular findings. The original group of putative FS occurred in 84 males and 79 females (median 52.5 y, range 2 to 99 y), and involved various anatomic sites. Only 26 cases met WHO criteria for FS, including 2 postradiation FS. These occurred in 16 males and 10 females (median 50 y, range 6 to 74 y), and involved the lower extremities (12 cases), head/ neck (5 cases), trunk (4 cases), upper extremities (3 case), and mediastinum/abdomen (2 cases). Clinical follow-up information was available for 24 of 26 (92%) cases, with a median of 5 years follow-up (range <1 to 35 y). Twelve patients (50%) died of locally aggressive and/or metastatic disease (median follow-up 1-year; range <1 to 8 y), 6 patients (25%) were alive without disease (median follow-up 11.5 y; range 2.5 to 35 y), and 6 patients (25%) died of other causes (median follow-up 10 y; range 9 to 18 y) (). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was positive for SYT gene rearrangement in all cases tested. Non-FS (137 cases) were reclassified as: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (32 cases), SS (21 cases), solitary fibrous tumor (14 cases), myxofibrosarcoma (11 cases), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (8 cases), FS dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and desmoplastic melanoma (4 cases each), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, spindle-cell liposarcoma (3 cases each), sclerosing epithelioid FS, fibroma-like epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, cellular fibrous histiocytoma (2 cases each), and others (17 cases). Using modern diagnostic criteria with ancillary IHC and molecular genetics, we have been able to reclassify 84% of putative FS. Exclusive of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the distinction of which from FS is subjective, 64% of putative FS were reclassified, most commonly as monophasic SS and solitary fibrous tumor. We conclude that true FS is exceedingly rare, accounting for <1% of approximately 10,000 adult soft tissue sarcomas seen at our institution during this time period, and should be diagnosed with great caution.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm that occurs in lymph nodes, skin, and the gastrointestinal tract. Many previously published cases were likely misdiagnosed examples of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Only small numbers of bona fide examples exist in the world literature; cases arising primarily at extranodal sites are not well described and often seem to go unrecognized. To characterize these tumors further, 14 extranodal histiocytic sarcomas were analyzed. Hematoxylin and eosin sections were reexamined, immunohistochemistry was performed, and clinical details were obtained from referring hospitals. Eight patients were female and 6 male (median age, 55 years; range, 15-89 years). All patients presented with a solitary mass, ranging in size from 1.8 to 12 cm (median 6.8 cm). Seven tumors arose in soft tissue (6 lower limb; 1 upper limb), 5 in the gastrointestinal tract (1 involving both stomach and colon, 1 ileum, 2 rectum, 1 anus), 1 in the nasal cavity, and 1 in the lung. Three gastrointestinal tract tumors also involved regional lymph nodes, and 1 involved the liver. Most cases had infiltrative margins. The tumors were generally composed of sheets of large epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval to irregular nuclei, vesicular chromatin, and large nucleoli. Binucleated cells were common, and 6 cases contained tumor giant cells. Mitoses ranged from 1 to 64 per 10 HPF (median 11 per 10 HPF). Necrosis was present in 8 cases. Nearly all tumors showed a striking inflammatory infiltrate, most often of neutrophils or lymphocytes. All cases were reactive for LCA, CD45RO, and CD68 (KP1 and PG-M1); 13 of 14 (93%) expressed CD4, 12 of 14 (86%) lysozyme, 8 of 10 (80%) CD31, 7 of 14 (50%) S-100 protein, and 5 of 14 (36%) focal CD1a. Two tumors showed weak, focal cytoplasmic positivity for CD30, and 1 for epithelial membrane antigen. The tumors were negative for ALK-1, CD21, CD35, CD3, CD20, CD34, myeloperoxidase, HMB-45, and keratins. Gastrointestinal tract cases were negative for c-kit and desmin. Six patients were treated with postoperative radiation and 7 with chemotherapy (CHOP or ProMACE-MOPP). Follow-up was available for 10 patients (median, 24 months; range, 4 months to 11 years). Two tumors recurred locally, and 5 patients developed distant spread: 3 to lymph nodes, 1 to lung, and 1 to bone. At the last follow-up, 2 patients have died of disseminated disease, 4 and 5 months following initial diagnosis. The patients who died thus far had the largest primary tumors. Histiocytic sarcoma may arise primarily in soft tissue and shows reproducible histologic features, including abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. Metastatic carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, and large cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas should be excluded by immunohistochemistry. Histiocytic sarcoma has the potential for an aggressive clinical course, most often with lymph node involvement. However, a subset of cases presenting with clinically localized disease have a favorable long-term outcome. Tumor size may be a prognostic factor.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In recent years the idea of using gene therapy as a modality in the treatment of diseases other than genetically inherited, monogenic disorders has taken root. This is particularly obvious in the field of oncology where currently more than 100 clinical trials have been approved worldwide. This report will summarize some of the exciting progress that has recently been made with respect to both targeting the delivery of potentially therapeutic genes to tumor sites and regulating their expression within the tumor microenvironment. In order to specifically target malignant cells while at the same time sparing normal tissue, cancer gene therapy will need to combine highly selective gene delivery with highly specific gene expression, specific gene product activity, and, possibly, specific drug activation. Although the efficient delivery of DNA to tumor sites remains a formidable task, progress has been made in recent years using both viral (retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus) and nonviral (liposomes, gene gun, injection) methods. In this report emphasis will be placed on targeted rather than high-efficiency delivery, although those would need to be combined in the future for effective therapy. To date delivery has been targeted to tumor-specific and tissue-specific antigens, such as epithelial growth factor receptor, c-kit receptor, and folate receptor, and these will be described in some detail. To increase specificity and safety of gene therapy further, the expression of the therapeutic gene needs to be tightly controlled within the target tissue. Targeted gene expression has been analyzed using tissue-specific promoters (breast-, prostate-, and melanoma-specific promoters) and disease-specific promoters (carcinoembryonic antigen, HER-2/neu, Myc-Max response elements, DF3/MUC). Alternatively, expression could be regulated externally with the use of radiation-induced promoters or tetracycline-responsive elements. Another novel possibility that will be discussed is the regulation of therapeutic gene products by tumor-specific gene splicing. Gene expression could also be targeted at conditions specific to the tumor microenvironment, such as glucose deprivation and hypoxia. We have concentrated on hypoxia-targeted gene expression and this report will discuss our progress in detail. Chronic hypoxia occurs in tissue that is more than 100-200 microns away from a functional blood supply. In solid tumors hypoxia is widespread both because cancer cells are more prolific than the invading endothelial cells that make up the blood vessels and because the newly formed blood supply is disorganized. Measurements of oxygen partial pressure in patients' tumors showed a high percentage of severe hypoxia readings (less than 2.5 mmHg), readings not seen in normal tissue. This is a major problem in the treatment of cancer, because hypoxic cells are resistant to radiotherapy and often to chemotherapy. However, severe hypoxia is also a physiological condition specific to tumors, which makes it a potentially exploitable target. We have utilized hypoxia response elements (HRE) derived from the oxygen-regulated phosphoglycerate kinase gene to control gene expression in human tumor cells in vitro and in experimental tumors. The list of genes that have been considered for use in the treatment of cancer is extensive. It includes cytokines and costimulatory cell surface molecules intended to induce an effective systemic immune response against tumor antigens that would not otherwise develop. Other inventive strategies include the use of internally expressed antibodies to target oncogenic proteins (intrabodies) and the use of antisense technology (antisense oligonucleotides, antigenes, and ribozymes). This report will concentrate more on novel genes encoding prodrug activating enzymes, so-called suicide genes (Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, Escherichia coli nitroreductase, E.
