        "Doc_abstract":"The Ink4a/Arf locus encodes two structurally unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) (murine p19(ARF)). Invariant inactivation of either the p16(INK4a)-cyclin D/CDK-pRb pathway and/or p53-p14(ARF) pathway occurs in most human tumors. Cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer cells contributing an alternate mechanism inactivating the p16(INK4a)/pRb pathway. Targeted overexpression of cyclin D1 to the mammary gland is sufficient for tumorigenesis, and cyclin D1-/- mice are resistant to Ras-induced mammary tumors. Recent studies suggest cyclin D1 and p16(INK4a) expression are reciprocal in human breast cancers. Herein, reciprocal regulation of cyclin D1 and p16(INK4a) was observed in tissues of mice mutant for the Ink4a/Arf locus. p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) inhibited DNA synthesis in MCF7 cells. p16(INK4a) repressed cyclin D1 expression and transcription. Repression of cyclin D1 by p16(INK4a) occurred independently of the p16(INK4a)-cdk4-binding function and required a cAMP-response element/activating transcription factor-2-binding site. p19(ARF) repressed cyclin D1 through a novel distal cis-element at -1137, which bound p53 in chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays. Transcriptional repression of the cyclin D1 gene through distinct DNA sequences may contribute to the tumor suppressor function of the Ink4a/Arf locus.",

In spite of the advances in breast cancer detection, the molecular basis of impalpable lesions and the corresponding circulating biomarkers are not well understood. Impalpable lesions, classified by radiologists according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System in the categories 3 and 4, can be either benign or malignant (slow growing or aggressive). In this article, we report the DNA methylation pattern in CDKN2A (p14(ARF)/p16(INK4a)) and in ATM gene promoters from 62 impalpable lesions, 39 peripheral blood samples, and 39 saliva samples, assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction method. ATM showed the greatest percentage of methylation in DNA from lesions (benign and malignant), blood (even with p16(INK4a)), and saliva, followed by p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). Among the malignant cases, ATM promoter was the most hypermethylated in lesion DNA and in blood and saliva DNAs, and p14(ARF), the least. The highest percentage of p16(INK4a) methylation was found in the blood. Finally, our data are relevant because they were obtained using impalpable breast lesions from patients who were carefully recruited in 2 public hospitals of Rio de Janeiro. ",

Deletions and mutations involving INK4a occur frequently in cancers, implying that p16INK4a, like pRB, suppresses tumor formation. An unrelated protein (p19ARF) arises in major part from an alternative reading frame of the mouse INK4a gene, and its ectopic expression in the nucleus of rodent fibroblasts induces G1 and G2 phase arrest. Economical reutilization of coding sequences in this manner is practically without precedent in mammalian genomes, and the unitary inheritance of p16INK4a and p19ARF may underlie their dual requirement in cell cycle control.",

Absence of p14(ARF) expression was seen in only one HCC, with homozygous deletion of the p14(ARF) gene.;Compared with p53 alteration, p14(ARF) alteration does not occur frequently, but may play a role in a subset of Japanese HCCs in the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis.

Conversely, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) causally associated with carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix contributes to tumor development by inactivating p53 and Rb. Nevertheless, a correlation between expression of p14(ARF)/p16(INK4A) and HPV infection in uterine cervix is less clear. To clarify this, we examined 25 cervical cancers and 11 normal uterine cervixes. HPV was detected in 21 of 25 cervical cancers (84%) and their subtype was determined by PCR-RFLP. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays showed overexpression of p14(ARF) mRNA in all 21 HPV-positive cases (100%). p16(INK4A) mRNA was overexpressed in 17 cases of the HPV-positive cases (81%). In four HPV-negative cancers, reduced expression of p14(ARF) mRNA was detected in two cases (50%) and reduced p16(INK4A) mRNA in three cases (75%). Our data indicate that the overexpression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) strongly associates with HPV-positive cervical cancers and that reduced expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) correlates with HPV-negative cervical cancers. These findings may indicate that impaired p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) mRNA expression contribute to tumor development in HPV-negative cervical cancers by failure to support p53 and Rb instead of their inactivation by HPV E6 and E7.",

Overall, the frequency of 9p21 alterations was 76% and for both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), promoter methylation is the commonest mechanism of gene inactivation. Alterations at this locus were significantly more common in tumors from immunocompetent compared with immunosuppressed individuals.

To study the contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analysed the alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INC4a) and p53. After microdissection, DNA of 71 hepatocellular carcinomas was analysed for INK4-ARF inactivation and p53 mutation by DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction-enzyme related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INC4a) were assessed by differential PCR. Inactivation of p14(ARF) was found in 11/71 cases (15%), alterations of p16(INK4a) occurred in 47/71 carcinomas (66%), which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Five tumours (7%) had homozygous deletions of the INK4a-ARF locus. We failed to detect specific mutations of both exons. P16(INK4a) methylation with an unmethylated p14(ARF) promotor appeared in 39 cases. Mutations of p53 were found in 30 of 71 HCC (42%), and only one of them harboured p14(ARF) inactivation. We failed to establish alterations of the INK4a-ARF locus or p53 status as independent prognostic factor in these tumours. Our data indicate, that p14(ARF) methylation occurs independently of p16(INK4a) alterations in a subset of HCC together with wild type p53. The INK4a-ARF-/p53-pathway was disrupted in 86% of HCC, either by p53 mutations or by INK4a-ARF inactivation, and may have co-operative effects in hepatocarcinogenesis.",

Epigenetic alterations involved in the onset and progression of breast cancer may serve as biomarkers for early detection and prediction of disease prognosis. Furthermore, using body fluids such as serum offers a non-invasive method to procure multiple samples for biomarker analyses. The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between methylation status of multiple cancer genes, p16(INK4A), p14(ARF), Cyclin D2 and Slit2 in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and paired serum DNA and clinicopathological parameters. Of the 36 breast cancer patients investigated, 31 (86%) tumors and 30 (83%) paired sera showed methylation of at least one of these 4 genes. Methylation frequencies varied from 27% for CyclinD2, 44% for p16(INK4A), 47% for p14(ARF) to 58% for Slit2. There was concordance between DNA methylation in tumor and paired serum DNA of each gene. This study underscores the potential utility of DNA methylation based screening of serum as a surrogate marker for tumor DNA methylation status of these genes in breast cancer. Further, expression profile of p16(INK4A) could be linked to epigenetic events, thus suggesting this pathway as a potential target for therapeutic strategies based on reversal of epigenetic silencing.",

The INK4A gene encodes two cell cycle regulators, p16(INK4A) and ARF, while INK4B encodes p15(INK4B). Previously, we have shown that the p16(INK4) tumor suppressor was not mutated or deleted in primary breast carcinomas. However, primary and metastatic breast carcinomas exhibited a relative hypomethylation of p16(INK4A), which is associated with expression, compared to normal breast tissue. The present study was conducted to determine if inactivation of p15(INK4B) and INK4A exon 1beta (ARF) are common events in breast carcinoma. Mutational analysis was performed by PCR-SSCP, and mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. Methylation-specific PCR was used to determine the methylation status of the p15(INK4B) promoter. Our results demonstrate that the p15(INK4B) gene was altered in 3 (21%) of the 14 breast cell lines; one had a silent mutation and two had homozygous deletion of the gene. None of the cell lines showed methylation of p15(INK4B). Two (14%) cell lines had homozygous deletion of INK4A exon 1beta. All normal and malignant breast tissue samples were wild-type and non-methylated for p15(INK4B) and wild-type for exon 1beta. Our results show that these structurally and functionally related genes are not invariably affected together, and the most frequently observed alteration at the INK4A and INK4B loci in breast carcinoma appears to be p16(INK4A) hypomethylation.",

In mice, the role of p16(INK4A) as the critical tumor suppressor gene at the INK4A locus was challenged when it was found that p19(ARF) only knock-out mice developed tumors, including gliomas. We have analysed the genetic status of the INK4A locus in 105 primary gliomas using both microsatellite mapping (MSM) and quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Comparison of the results of the two methods revealed agreement in 67% of the tumors examined. In discordant cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was always found to support QRT-PCR classification. Direct assessment of p14(ARF) exon 1beta, p16(INK4A) exon 1alpha and exon 2 by QRT-PCR revealed 43 (41%) homozygous and eight (7%) hemizygous deletions at the INK4A locus. In 49 (47%) gliomas, both alleles were retained. In addition, QRT-PCR, but not MSM, detected hyperploidy in five (5%) tumors. Deletion of p14(ARF) was always associated with co-deletion of p16(INK4A) and increased in frequency upon progression from low to high grade gliomas. Shorter survival was associated with homozygous deletions of INK4A in the subgroup of glioblastoma patients older than 50 years of age (P=0.025, Anova test single factor, alpha=0.05).",

First, a human papillomavirus (HPV)-dependent pathway, in which premalignant stages of vulvar cancer are the classic vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) lesions. Second, an HPV-independent pathway, associated with differentiated VIN III lesions and/or lichen sclerosus. To obtain insight into the mechanisms underlying these pathways, we determined the relationship between HPV DNA and the expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) in non- and (pre)malignant vulvar lesions. Seventy-three archival samples of non- and (pre)neoplastic vulvar lesions were selected and tested for hr-HPV DNA using a broad-spectrum HPV detection/genotyping assay (SPF(10)-LiPA) and the expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A). The prevalence of HPV increased with the severity of the classic VIN lesions; in VIN I no hr-HPV was detected, in VIN II 43%, and in VIN III 71% of the samples were hr-HPV-positive. Roughly the same was true for the expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A). The simultaneous expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) was highly associated with the presence of hr-HPV DNA. Hr-HPV was detected in only a single case of the differentiated VIN III lesions, whereas no expression of p14(ARF) was found and 16(INK4A) was present in only two cases. All 16 samples of vulvar cancer were hr-HPV DNA- negative, although in respectively 63% and 25%, p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) was expressed. No relation was found between hr-HPV and the expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) in the 20 nonneoplastic vulvar lesions. Our results provide further evidence that vulvar squamous cell carcinoma is a multifactorial disease that develops from two different pathways.

Still, the cell cycle-regulatory genes p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) remain poorly understood in oral cavity premalignant lesions. This study evaluated INK4a/ARF locus alterations in 26 patients (28 samples) deemed to be at increased risk for malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma due to the diagnosis of severe oral epithelial dysplasia. Microscopically confirmed dysplastic oral epithelium and matching normal tissue were laser capture-microdissected from paraffin sections, DNA was isolated, and molecular techniques were used to evaluate p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) gene deletion, mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and hypermethylation events. Deletion of exon 1beta, 1alpha, or 2 was detected in 3.8%, 11.5%, and 7.7% of patients, respectively. INK4a and ARF mutations were detected in 15.4% and 11.5% of patients with severe dysplasia of the oral epithelium. All identified mutations occurred in the INK4a/ARF conserved exon 2. Allelic imbalance was assessed using three markers previously reported to show high LOH rates in head and neck tumors. LOH was found in 42.1%, 35.0%, and 82.4% of patients for the markers IFNalpha, D9S1748, and D9S171, respectively. Hypermethylation of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) was detected in 57.7% and 3.8% of patients, respectively, using nested, two-stage methylation-specific PCR.

Splicing of alternative first exons (1 alpha vs. 1 beta) to a common second exon within INK4a generates mRNAs in which exon 2 sequences are translated in two different reading frames. One of the products, the cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a, is functionally inactivated by mutations or deletions in a wide variety of cancers. However, because many such mutations reside in exon 2, they also affect the alternative reading frame (ARF) protein. To determine whether such mutations disrupt p19ARF function, we introduced naturally occurring missense mutations into mouse INK4a exon 2 sequences and tested mutant p16INK4a and p19ARF proteins for their ability to inhibit cell cycle progression. Six p19ARF point mutants remained fully active in mediating cell cycle arrest in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas two of the corresponding mutations within p16INK4a resulted in complete loss of activity. Analysis of p19ARF deletion mutants indicated that the unique aminoterminal domain encoded by exon 1 beta was both necessary and sufficient for inducing G1 arrest. Therefore, cancer-associated mutations within exon 2 of the INK4a gene specifically target p16INK4a, and not p19ARF, for inactivation.",

Recently, we reported loss of heterozygosity of the region in which p16(INK4a) is located in more than one-half of primary breast tumors. However, mutational analysis of these same tumors revealed mutation of p16(INK4a) to be infrequent. Other possible modes of inactivation, such as de novo methylation and homozygous deletion, have since been shown to occur in numerous neoplasias. Furthering the complexity of this locus, a transcript overlapping the p16(INK4a) coding sequence and encoding a novel peptide with growth-suppressive activity, p19(ARF), has been described. To clearly elucidate the target of aberrations affecting this subchromosomal region and approximate frequency in breast cancer, we performed a comprehensive study including p16 deletion analysis by means of interphase chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization, methylation analysis of the first exon encoding p16(INK4a) (exon 1alpha), mutational analysis of exon 1beta by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of p19(ARF) transcripts, and expression of both alpha and beta transcripts by reverse transcription PCR. Homozygous deletion of p16, as determined by interphase chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization, was observed in 3 of 18 (17%) tumors analyzed, whereas de novo methylation of exon 1alpha was observed in an additional 17% (4 of 23). Reduced expression of p16(INK4a) was observed in 11 tumors (48%), including all those in which homozygous deletion or complete methylation was observed. No mutations of exon 1 beta were detected, and expression of its transcript was variable, with 13% demonstrating decreased expression and 17% demonstrating overexpression.

In addition, we screened the CDKN2B (p15 INK4b), CDKN2C (p18 INK4c), CDK4 and p53R2 genes for mutations in the tumour tissues. Besides concomitant alterations in the CDKN2A and p53 loci in more than half of the cases, our results showed that in 18 OSCC (86%) the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) ) gene was affected through mutations, homozygous/hemizygous deletions and promoter hypermethylation. Eight out of 10 tumours with mutations or promoter hypermethylation specific to the CDKN2A/p16 INK4a gene showed loss of the wild-type allele.

The INK4a-ARF (CDKN2A) locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes two tumour suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), which act as upstream regulators of the Rb-CDK4 and p53 pathways. To study the contribution of each pathway in pleomorphic adenomas, this study analysed alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, and pRb in these tumours. After microdissecting the different histological components, 42 pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland were analysed for INK4a-ARF inactivation by DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction enzyme-related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), mRNA expression, microsatellite analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) were assessed by differential PCR. The status of p53 and Rb was examined by direct sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Using microdissection, it was possible to examine the tumour components, i.e. epithelial, mesenchymal, and transitional, separately after immunohistochemical identification. Methylation of p14(ARF) was found in 1/42 cases and alterations of p16(INK4a) occurred in 12/42 of pleomorphic adenomas, which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Microdeletions or specific mutations of either exon were not detected. Methylation was detected exclusively in the epithelial and transitional components and not within the mesenchymal part of the tumour. p53 mutations were detected in 4/42 adenomas, also occurring solely in the epithelial components of the tumours. pRb was detected immunohistochemically in 40/42 adenomas. In normal, corresponding parotid tissue, p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, and pRb alterations were not observed. The observation that alterations of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a), and also p53 mutations, occurred exclusively in the epithelial and transitional components of pleomorphic adenoma supports the theory that these areas are prone to malignant transformation to carcinoma in adenoma.",

Both the proapoptotic and cell cycle-regulatory functions of p14 ARF were initially proposed to be strictly dependent on a functional p53/mdm-2 tumor suppressor pathway. However, a number of recent reports have implicated p53-independent mechanisms in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction by p14 ARF. Here, we show that the G1 cell cycle arrest induced by p14 ARF entirely depends on both p53 and p21 in human HCT116 and DU145 carcinoma cells. In contrast, neither loss of p53 nor p21 impaired apoptosis induction by p14 ARF as evidenced by nuclear DNA fragmentation, phosphatidyl serine exposure, and caspase activation, which included caspase-3/7- and caspase-9-like activities. However, lack of functional p21 resulted in the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and markedly enhanced p14 ARF-induced apoptosis that was, nevertheless, efficiently inhibited by the cell permeable broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O)-methyl)-fluoromethylketone). Thus, loss of cell cycle restriction point control in the absence of p21 may interfere with p14 ARF-induced apoptosis. Finally, these data indicate that the signaling events required for G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction by p14 ARF dissociate upstream of p53.",

In mild dysplasia, SH3GL2, p16(INK4a), and p14(ARF) showed a higher frequency of overall alterations (60-70%) than in p15(INK4b) (40%). However, in subsequent stages of tumour progression, the alteration frequency of these genes did not change significantly. One novel mutation in common exon 2 of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and three in exon 9 of SH3GL2 were seen. Concordance was seen in the expression of these genes with their molecular alterations. Deletions of INK4A-ARF and p15(INK4b) have a significant poor patient outcome. The alterations of p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), and p15(INK4b) were positively correlated with tobacco and inversely with HPV, while SH3GL2 alterations were independent of these factors. Based on aetiological factors, four tumour subtypes were recognized: HPV(-)tobacco(-) (I), HPV(+)tobacco(-) (II), HPV(-)tobacco(+) (III), and HPV(+)tobacco(+) (IV). Groups III and IV showed a high frequency of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF)/p15(INK4b) alterations with significant poor patient outcome in comparison to group II.

        "Doc_abstract":"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a) locus encodes two distinct tumor suppressors, p16INK4a and p19ARF, whose functions interrelate in the regulation of cell proliferation as key components of the retinoblastoma and p53 pathways, respectively. In many types of cancer, alterations of Cdkn2a abrogate the functions of both suppressors, implying that both are integral to the genesis of certain cancer types. While this has been observed in mouse lung adenocarcinogenesis, recent observations also suggested that naturally occurring variation at the Cdkn2a locus is probably operative in the development of these tumors. Firstly, two common haplotypes of mouse Cdkn2a have been identified, each of which encodes cosegregating variants of p16INK4a and p19ARF. The p16INK4a variants differ at amino acids 18 (histidine or proline) and 51 (valine or isoleucine), whereas the p19ARF variants differ only at amino acid 72 (histidine or arginine). Secondly, genetic resistance to lung tumor formation appears to segregate with one particular haplotype, which also is deleted preferentially in lung adenocarcinomas of Cdkn2a heterozygous mice. Here we attempt to explain these observations and to characterize further the roles of p16INK4 and p19ARF in mouse lung tumorigenesis by examining the function and expression of each of the variants of Cdkn2a. Functional analysis showed that the proline 18/isoleucine 51 p16INK4a variant was diminished in cdk6 binding, cdk6 inhibition and NIH/3T3 fibroblast growth suppression compared with the histidine 18/valine 51 variant, whereas both of the p19ARF variants suppressed growth with similar potencies. Also, the different alleles for p16INK4a and p19ARF were transcribed equally in the normal lungs of Cdkn2a heterozygotes, as determined by comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. These results indicate that strain-specific variation in p16INK4a function is exploited in mouse lung tumorigenesis and strongly implicate a role for p16INK4a in lung cancer predisposition and development.",

None of the patients harbored germline nucleotide changes that lead to truncation or that create or disrupt consensus splice sites of BRCA2 or missense variants with clear pathogenic potential.;These findings suggest that less than 2% of cases of uveal melanoma can be ascribed to germline mutations in BRCA2, P16(INK4A), P14(ARF), or P15.

Since CDKIs can inhibit cell proliferation, they may have a role as tumor suppressor genes. To determine if alterations of CDKI genes may be involved in tumorigenesis of breast cancer, we examined the mutational status of p16(INK4A), p15(INK4B), p18(INK4C), p19(INK4D) CDKI genes in 36 primary breast carcinomas and 9 breast cancer cell lines using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), direct DNA sequencing, and Southern blot analysis. Furthermore, amplification of cyclin D1, D2, D3 genes were also examined in these samples. One mutation of p15(INK4B) gene occurred, resulting in change of aspartic acid to asparagine at codon 85. Since aspartic acid at this position is conserved between all four human and murine INK4 proteins, this missense mutation may have functional significance. The sample with a p15(INK4B) point mutation was accompanied by amplification of the cyclin D1 gene. A deletion of the p18(INK4C) gene was found in a primary tumor. Three deletions of the p16(INK4A) gene and two deletions of the p15(INK4B) gene were found in the cell lines. Also, we found amplification of the p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) loci in a clinical sample as well as amplification of the p19(INK4D) in another sample, and amplification of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene in one cell line and two primary tumors. We suspect that a critical gene for breast cancer is amplified near the MPO gene. These data indicate that CDKI mutations are moderately rare in breast cancer and are often associated with the simultaneous alteration of more than one cell-cycle regulatory gene.",

All three demonstrated that breast and colon cancers expressing cytoplasmic p16(INK4) represent distinct biological subsets.

In view of the reports concerning breast and colon carcinomas, we conducted an ultrastructural re-evaluation of our cases to clarify the specificity of p16(INK4A) cytoplasmic expression.

Negative tumor cells also were visible. In the tumor-associated stromal, cells p16(INK4A) immunoreactivity was detected only in the nuclei.

To understand whether cytotoxic agents promote molecular aging, we measured expression of p16 (INK4a) and other senescence markers in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.;Blood and clinical information were prospectively obtained from 33 women with stage I to III breast cancer at four time points: before anthracycline-based chemotherapy, immediately after anthracycline-based chemotherapy, 3 months after anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and 12 months after anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Expression of senescence markers p16 (INK4a) and ARF mRNA was determined using TaqMan quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in CD3(+) T lymphocytes, telomere length was determined by Southern analysis, and senescence-associated cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Findings were independently assessed in a cross-sectional cohort of 176 breast cancer survivors enrolled a median of 3.4 years after treatment; 39% previously received chemotherapy. All statistical tests were two-sided.;In prospectively analyzed patients, expression of p16 (INK4a) and ARF increased immediately after chemotherapy and remained elevated 12 months after treatment. Median increase in log2 p16 (INK4a) was 0.81 (interquartile range = 0.28-1.62; Wilcoxon signed-rank P < .001), or a 75% absolute increase in expression, equivalent to the increase observed over 14.7 years of chronological aging. ARF expression was comparably increased (P < .001). Increased expression of p16 (INK4a) and ARF was associated with dose-dense therapy and hematological toxicity. Expression of two senescence-associated cytokines (VEGFA and MCP1) was durably increased by adjuvant chemotherapy. Telomere length was not affected by chemotherapy.

Loss of INK4 gene product function, particularly that of p16(INK4a), is found in 10-60% of human tumors, suggesting that broadly applicable anticancer therapies might be based on restoration of p16(INK4a) CDK inhibitory function. Although much less frequent, defects of p19(INK4d) have also been associated with human cancer (osteosarcomas). The protein structures of some INK4 family members, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray techniques, have begun to clarify the functional role of p16(INK4a) and the dysfunction introduced by the mutations associated with human tumors.;The crystal structure of human p19(INK4d) has been determined at 1.8 A resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement methods. The fold of p19(INK4d) produces an oblong molecule comprising five approximately 32-residue ankyrin-like repeats. The architecture of the protein demonstrates the high structural similarity within the INK4 family. Comparisons to other ankyrin-repeat-containing proteins (GABPbeta, 53BP2 and myotrophin) show similar structures with comparable hydrogen-bonding patterns and hydrophobic interactions. Such comparisons highlight the splayed beta-loop geometry that is specific to INK4 inhibitors. This geometry is the result of a modified ankyrin structure in the second repeat.;Among the INK4 inhibitors, the highest amino acid sequence conservation is found in the helical stacks; this conservation creates a conserved beta-loop geometry specific to INK4 inhibitors. Therefore, in addition to models which predict that the conserved helix alpha6 is responsible for CDK inhibition, a binding mode whereby the loops of INK4 proteins bind to the CDKs should also be considered. A similar loop-based interaction is seen in the complex formed between the ankyrin-repeat-containing protein GABPbeta and_GABPalpha. This mode of binding would be consistent with the observation that p16(INK4a) is sensitive to deleterious mutations found throughout this tumor suppressor protein; these mutations probably destabilize the three-dimensional structure.",

We elucidated genetic determinants underlying tumor escape in a transgenic mouse model of Wnt pathway-driven breast cancer, wherein targeted therapy is simulated by abrogating doxycycline-dependent Wnt1 transgene expression within established tumors. In mice with intact tumor suppressor pathways, tumors typically circumvented doxycycline withdrawal by reactivating Wnt signaling, either via aberrant (doxycycline-independent) Wnt1 transgene expression or via acquired somatic mutations in the gene encoding beta-catenin. Germline introduction of mutant tumor suppressor alleles into the model altered the timing and mode of tumor escape. Relapses occurring in the context of null Ink4a/Arf alleles (disrupting both the p16 Ink4a and p19 Arf tumor suppressors) arose quickly and rarely reactivated the Wnt pathway. In addition, Ink4a/Arf-deficient relapses resembled p53-deficient relapses in that both displayed morphologic and molecular hallmarks of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, Ink4a/Arf deficiency promoted relapse in the absence of gross genomic instability. Moreover, Ink4a/Arf-encoded proteins differed in their capacity to suppress oncogene independence. Isolated p19 Arf deficiency mirrored p53 deficiency in that both promoted rapid, EMT-associated mammary tumor escape, whereas isolated p16 Ink4a deficiency failed to accelerate relapse.

Primary tumours were analysed for allelic imbalances (AI) with microsatellite markers for chromosome 9, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and IHC with enhanced sensitivity by tyramide signal amplification (TSA-IHC), and by RT-PCR. No homozygous deletions at 9p21 were detected. AI at 9p21, which was found in approximately 60% of the tumours, completely failed to indicate the functional inactivation of the two INK4a gene products. Immunostaining of normal squamous epithelia revealed very low levels of p16(INK4a), whereas p14(ARF) was readily detectable. In 160 tumours, IHC suggested a loss of p16(INK4a) expression in 90%. However, by TSA-IHC, only 53.7% showed loss of p16(INK4a) expression, and this was consistent with the RT-PCR analyses. In 100 tumours analysed for both proteins, selective loss of p16(INK4a) occurred in 37%; loss of p14(ARF) was found in only 15%, and selective loss in only 4%; 11% of the tumours had lost both proteins. We conclude that only IHC with high sensitivity and the combined expression analysis of mRNAs and proteins is suitable for studying the role of INK4a in HNSCC. The INK4a gene expression defects are frequent but not universal and primarily affect p16(INK4a). Their clinical impact is still not clear.",

However, significant controversy exists regarding the role of p63 isoforms as oncoproteins or tumor suppressors. Here, lentiviruses were developed to drive long-term overexpression of ΔNp63α in primary keratinocytes. Elevated levels of ΔNp63α in vitro promote long-term survival and block both replicative and oncogene-induced senescence in primary keratinocytes, as evidenced by the expression of SA-β-gal and the presence of nuclear foci of heterochromatin protein 1γ. The contribution of ΔNp63α to cancer development was assessed using an in vivo grafting model of experimental skin tumorigenesis that allows distinction between benign and malignant tumors. Grafted lenti-ΔNp63α keratinocytes do not form tumors, whereas lenti-GFP/v-ras(Ha) keratinocytes develop well-differentiated papillomas. Lenti-ΔNp63α/v-ras(Ha) keratinocytes form undifferentiated carcinomas. The average volume of lenti-ΔNp63α/v-ras(Ha) tumors was significantly higher than those in the lenti-GFP/v-ras(Ha) group, consistent with increased BrdU incorporation detected by immunohistochemistry. The block in oncogene-induced senescence corresponds to sustained levels of E2F1 and phosphorylated AKT, and is associated with loss of induction of p16(ink4a)/p19(arf). The relevance of p16(ink4a)/p19(arf) loss was demonstrated in grafting studies of p19(arf)-null keratinocytes, which develop malignant carcinomas in the presence of v-ras(Ha) similar to those arising in wildtype keratinocytes that express lenti-ΔNp63α and v-ras(Ha). Our findings establish that ΔNp63α has oncogenic activity and its overexpression in human squamous cell carcinomas contributes to the malignant phenotype, and implicate its ability to regulate p16(ink4a)/p19(arf) in the process.",

This suggests CKI defects are frequently responsible for neoplastic transformation in canine mammary carcinomas. p16 and p14ARF are two alternatively spliced products derived from the canine p16/INK4A/p14ARF gene locus. Despite omissions in the published p16 transcript and canine genome and the presence of GC-rich repeats, we determined the complete coding sequence of canine p16 revealing a deletion and frameshift mutation in p16 exon 1α in CMT28 cells. In addition, we determined canine p14ARF mRNA and protein sequences. Mapping of these mutations uncovered important aspects of p16 and p14ARF expression and defects in CMT28 cells shifting the p16 reading frame into p14ARF making a fusion protein that was predicted to be truncated, unstable and devoid of structural and functional integrity.

We investigated the involvement of the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and p53 genes in AK and in the progression of AK to SCC. Mutational analysis on exons 1a, 1b and 2 of the CDKN2A locus and exon 1 of the CDKN2B locus as well as allelic imbalance was performed in 26 AK specimens. Expression levels of the genes p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a) and p53 were examined in 16 AKs and 12 SCCs by real-time RT-PCR. A previously described polymorphism of p16(INK4a) (Ala148Thr) was detected at an allelic frequency of 12%. Six samples carried novel mutations at codon 71 of the CDKN2A locus and one sample presented an additional mutation at codon 65. Two AK samples carried a not-previously described non-UV type missense mutation at codon 184 (Val184Glu) of exon 1b in the p14(ARF) gene. Regarding the CDKN2B locus a new mutation at codon 50 (Ala50Thr) and another at codon 24 (Arg24Arg), were detected. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was found in 15% of AKs in at least one marker, indicating that genetic instability has some implication in the development of AK. Down-regulation of p16(INK4a) and p53 mRNA levels was noted in SCC compared to AK. TSGs expression levels in sun-exposed morphologically normal-appearing skin, suggests that abnormal growth stimuli might exist in these tissues as well. Furthermore, we suggest a possible role of p15(INK4b), independently from the intracellular pathway mediated by p16(INK4a), and of p14(ARF) in AK development, as well as in the progression of AK to SCC. The deregulation of the expression profiles of the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and p53 genes may, independently of mutations and LOH at 9p21, play a significant role in AK and progression of AK to SCC.",

However, little is known regarding the function of p15INK4B translated from the same locus. To determine the frequency of CDKN2AB loss in human mutant KRAS lung cancer, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was interrogated. Two-hit inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B occurs frequently in patients with mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, p15INK4B loss occurs in the presence of biallelic inactivation of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), suggesting that p15INK4B loss confers a selective advantage to mutant KRAS lung cancers that are p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) deficient. To determine the significance of CDKN2AB loss in vivo, genetically engineered lung cancer mouse models that express mutant Kras in the respiratory epithelium were utilized. Importantly, complete loss of CDKN2AB strikingly accelerated mutant Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis, leading to loss of differentiation, increased metastatic disease, and decreased overall survival. Primary mutant Kras lung epithelial cells lacking Cdkn2ab had increased clonogenic potential. Furthermore, comparative analysis of mutant Kras;Cdkn2a null with Kras;Cdkn2ab null mice and experiments with mutant KRAS;CDKN2AB-deficient human lung cancer cells indicated that p15INK4B is a critical tumor suppressor. Thus, the loss of CDKN2AB is of biologic significance in mutant KRAS lung tumorigenesis by fostering cellular proliferation, cancer cell differentiation, and metastatic behavior.;These findings indicate that mutant Kras;Cdkn2ab null mice provide a platform for accurately modeling aggressive lung adenocarcinoma and testing therapeutic modalities.",

DNAs extracted from 17 different cancer cell lines and 31 primary pheochromocytoma tumors were analyzed for deletion and mutation of RD using real-time PCR and direct DNA sequencing. We found that RD was deleted in human cancer cell lines and pheochromocytoma tumors at frequencies of 41.2% (7/17) and 13.0% (4/31), respectively. While some of these RD deletion events occurred along with deletions of the entire INK4/ARF locus, other RD deletion events were independent of genetic alterations in p15, p14(ARF) , and p16. Furthermore, the status of RD was poorly associated with the expression of p15, p14(ARF) , and p16 in tested cancer cell lines and tumors.

After treatment with the demethylating agent (5-AzoCyt) RD cell line showed p16 expression. This has not been observed with the other cell lines.

Here, we investigated the expression and the prognostic value of key cell cycle proteins in the pRb and p53 pathways in both human papillomavirus type 16-positive and -negative tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas. Using immunohistochemistry, 77 tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas with known human papillomavirus type 16 status and clinical outcome were analyzed for expression of Ki67, p16(INK4A,) cyclin D1, pRb, p14(ARF), MDM2, p53, p21(Cip1/WAF1), and p27(KIP1). Results were correlated with each other and with clinical and demographic patient data. A total of 35% of tonsillar carcinomas harbored integrated human papillomavirus type 16 DNA and p16(INK4A) overexpression, both being considered essential features for human papillomavirus association. These tumors also showed the overexpression of p14(ARF) (P<0.0001) and p21(Cip1/WAF1) (P=0.001), and downregulation of pRb (P<0.0001) and cyclin D1 (P=0.027) compared with the human papillomavirus-negative cases. Univariate Cox regression analyses revealed a favorable survival rate for non-smokers (P=0.006), as well as for patients with T1-2 tumors (P<0.0001) or tumors showing low expression of cyclin D1 (P=0.028), presence of human papillomavirus and overexpression of p16(INK4A) (P=0.01), p14(ARF) (P=0.02) or p21(Cip1/WAF1) (P=0.004). In multivariate regression analyses, smoking and tumor size, as well as expression of cyclin D1 and p21(Cip1/WAF1), were found to be independent prognostic markers. We conclude that human papillomavirus positivity in tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas strongly correlates with p21(Cip1/WAF1) and p14(ARF) overexpression and downregulation of pRb and cyclin D1. In particular p21(Cip1/WAF1) overexpression is an excellent favorable prognosticator in tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas.",

In the current study, using fluorescent-labeled, high-density microsatellite markers for allelotyping, the authors pinpointed three minimal deleted regions (MDRs) and screened mutations of putative TSGs on chromosomes 3, 9, and 11 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cases occurring in Taiwan.;A total of 133 informative microsatellite markers were used on chromosomes 3, 9, and 11 with an average marker density of 4 centimorgans (cM) for the allelotyping of genomic DNAs isolated from NPC tissues and their corresponding lymphocytes in 48 patients. The correlation between allelic loss and the clinicopathologic parameters of NPC tissues was examined. In addition, putative TSGs including FHIT, p16(INK4a), and p19(ARF) were selected for mutation screening to investigate their potential participation in NPC tumorigenesis.;Of 3787 informative allelotyping data, 25 frequent allelic losses (or loss of heterozygosity [LOH]) in 13 cytogenetic loci were identified based on a deletion frequency that was greater than the average of allelic loss on that particular chromosome. Several significant associations were determined after statistical analysis of the correlation between allelic loss and clinicopathologic parameters. The allelic losses by D9S318 and D11S1304 were associated with N2/N3 (P = 0.035 and P = 0.005, respectively), and those by D9S905 and D11S1304 were associated with grouped American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage III/IV samples (P = 0.022 and P = 0.017, respectively) of NPC tissues. In addition, three MDRs were revealed on 3p25.3-24.1 (< 19 cM), 3p23-21.31 (< 9 cM), and 11q22.1-23.2 (< 8 cM). To examine somatic mutations in previously reported TSGs located near these frequent LOH loci, three candidate genes, p16(INK4a), p19(ARF), and FHIT, were analyzed. Point mutations in the coding region of FHIT and in the intron 1 splicing acceptor site of both p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) were detected in NPC cell lines. Sequence analysis of both p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) transcripts revealed that the point mutation resulted in skipping of exon 2 and the generation of shorter transcripts.;High-density allelotyping permitted the discovery of 3 MDRs on 3p25.3-24.1 (< 19 cM), 3p23-21.31 (< 9 cM), and 11q22.1-23.2 (< 8 cM) and a correlation was determined between allelic loss and clinicopathologic parameters of NPC tissues. More important, one somatic mutation in NPC cell lines on the intron 1/exon 2 splicing acceptor site of the INK4a/ARF locus was found to result in exon 2 skipping both p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) transcripts, which presumably inactivates the functions of both the p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) proteins.",

The bulk of this variation is stochastic and functionally neutral, with only a small minority representing \"drivers\" that contribute to the genesis and maintenance of tumors. Drivers are often directly or inversely correlated across tumors, reflecting the molecular and regulatory signaling pathways in which they operate. Here, a profile of genetic and epigenetic drivers in 110 human melanoma cell lines was generated and searched for non-random distribution patterns. Statistically significant mutual exclusivity was revealed among components of each of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-RB, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed between promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor β (RARB) and CDKN2A alterations affecting p14(ARF) (P < 0.0001), suggesting a functional link between RARβ signaling and the melanoma-suppressive activities of p14(ARF). Mechanistically, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment increased the expression of p14(ARF) in primary human melanocytes and the steady-state levels of p14(ARF) in these cells were shown to be regulated via RARβ. Furthermore, the ability of ATRA to induce senescence is reduced in p14(ARF)-depleted melanocytes, and we provide proof-of-concept that ATRA can induce irreversible growth arrest in melanoma cells with an intact RARβ-p14(ARF) signaling axis, independent of p16(INK4A) and p53 status.;These data highlight the power of mutual exclusivity analysis of cancer drivers to unravel molecular pathways and establish a previously unrecognized cross-talk between RARβ and p14(ARF) with potential implications for melanoma treatment.",

To explore the involvement of CDKN2 in prostate carcinogenesis, alterations of CDKN2 were examined in 116 human prostate tissues and cell lines and xenografts. Markedly reduced expression of CDKN2 mRNA was found in 43% (26 of 60) of untreated primary carcinomas, whereas no alteration was observed in 10 benign prostatic hyperplasias. In 17 matched sets from individual patients, 41% of cancerous tissues in contrast to 6% of noncancerous tissues expressed low levels of CDKN2 mRNA, supporting the role of CDKN2 as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Alteration of CDKN2 was observed in each prostate tumor cell line, including one with a missense mutation, and in one of three xenograft tumor tissues derived from primary carcinomas. Two cell lines (PC-3 and TSU-Pr1) expressed only CDKN2 E1beta transcripts, indicating that the expression of CDKN2 E1alpha and E1beta are under separate control in the prostate. A high level of CDKN2 expression was related to abnormal RB1 in one primary tumor and in the DU145 cell line, which expressed the mutated CDKN2 allele. Analysis of genomic DNA indicated that altered CDKN2 expression in primary carcinomas of the prostate was more frequently due to down-regulation of transcription (five of seven) than deletion of the gene (two of seven). Additionally, CDKN2 mRNA was induced in nonexpressor cell lines by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. This study demonstrates that alteration of CDKN2 is one of the most frequent genetic abnormalities in prostate cancer and may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis.",

P16 is deleted or mutated at high frequency in a variety of tumor cell lines including melanoma and bladder carcinoma lines. As such, it is likely to be a tumor suppressor gene. Here we show that P16 is mutated in primary bladder carcinomas (3 of 33) and melanomas (5 of 34). These findings support studies that show P16 mutations are not solely a product of growth in tissue culture but rather are involved in formation of tumors in viva.

Here we have developed methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSPCR) methods to detect methylation of CpG sites in p14(ARF) in CRC cell lines and primary CRC tumors, and correlated p14(ARF) mRNA expression with methylation in CRC cell lines using competitive quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods. Ten CRC cell lines were studied; three (DLD-1, HCT15 and SW48) showed extensive methylation and six (Colo320, SW480, HT29, Caco2, SW837 and WiDr) were unmethylated; the other cell line, LoVo, showed partial methylation that affected exon 1beta but not the immediate upstream CpG sites. p14(ARF) mRNA was expressed at extremely low levels in fully methylated cell lines and at 10(4)- to 10(5)-fold higher levels in unmethylated cell lines. p14(ARF) expression in the partially methylated LoVo cell line was intermediate. Treatment of LoVo cells with 2 microM 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine for 72 h was associated with marked (100-fold) induction of mRNA levels. Of 119 primary CRCs, 18% contained p14(ARF) methylation, although partial methylation was the most common pattern observed (in 67% of methylated tumors). Methylation of p14(ARF) was often accompanied by p16(INK4a) methylation; however, 50% of p14(ARF) methylated tumors contained unmethylated p16(INK4a).

Many cell cycle regulators, such as p14(ARF), p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a), are important in G1 cell cycle arrest and oncogene-induced senescence. The bcl-2 protein is one of the key components that control apoptosis, while the p53 protein plays key roles in both mechanisms. The genes of these key regulator proteins are often mutated or deleted in various malignancies. It is unknown how senescence and apoptosis are regulated in one of the most common tumors of the female genital tract, cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this study the, expression of senescence, apoptosis and proliferation markers in normal cervical epithelium, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and SCC are characterized via immunohistochemical staining for p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), bcl-2, p53 and Ki-67 in tissue microarray blocks containing 20 samples each of normal cervix, moderate-to-severe cervical dysplasia (CIN II-III) and invasive SCC. Samples are derived from 60 total cases of cervical biopsies and cervical conizations. Results showed that the proliferation marker, Ki-67, is markedly increased, and the senescence markers, p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) are overexpressed in both dysplasia and carcinoma. P53 immunostain is negative in all normal cervical tissue, and positive in dysplasia and carcinoma. Although the expression of bcl-2 is increased in dysplasia, this marker is negative in approximately half of SCC cases. These results suggest that some senescence pathways are activated and are still maintained in cervical dysplasia and carcinoma. However proliferation is increased and carcinogenesis is not thwarted, leading to eventual development of cervical cancer. Other mechanisms, such as those that account for the apparent overexpression of p53 and paradoxical loss of bcl-2 expression in some SCC cases, as well as additional senescence and apoptotic pathways, may play key roles carcinogenesis of cervical SCC.",

We examined the frequency of INK4a-ARF, p53, and CDK4 mutations in skin carcinomas from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a rare autosomal disease that is associated with a defect in DNA repair and that predisposes patients to skin cancer.;DNA from skin cancers of 28 unrelated XP patients was screened for mutations in p53, INK4a-ARF, and CDK4 coding exons by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and automated sequencing. Data were evaluated with the use of the exact unconditional test derived from Fisher's test. All statistical tests were two-sided.;Eight of 28 XP-associated tumors had mutations in the INK4a-ARF locus. Three XP-associated tumors had multiple mutations at this locus. In all, 13 mutations in the INK4a-ARF locus were detected in XP-associated tumors, of which seven (54%) were signature UV radiation-induced mutations, i.e., tandem CC : GG-->TT : AA transitions. p53 mutations, mostly of the type induced by UV radiation, were present in 12 tumors (43%). Statistically significant positive associations were found between the frequency of mutations in p53 and in p16(INK4a) (P =.008) and between the frequency of mutations in p53 and in p14(ARF) (P<.001). No mutations were detected within the CDK4 gene.;We have demonstrated for the first time the occurrence of UV radiation-induced mutations in INK4a-ARF in XP-associated skin carcinomas. The simultaneous inactivation of p53 and INK4a-ARF may be linked to the genetic instability caused by XP and could be advantageous for tumor progression.",

Moreover, p16INK4a is inactivated in many human tumors, while it has been very recently reported that p19ARF null mice develop tumors early in life. We show here that p19ARF is able to inhibit the formation of G418-resistant colonies when transfected into human and mouse cell lines expressing wild-type p53, regardless of p16 status. Moreover its amino terminal domain encoded by exon 1beta is still sufficient to obtain the same effect. We have analysed the ability of p19ARF to interfere with Ras-mediated cellular transformation in the NIH3T3 cell line. Cotransfection of p19ARF together with activated ras potently inhibited the formation of transformed foci in a dose-dependent manner. We have also isolated stable NIH3T3 transfectants expressing p19ARF and we have measured their growth properties as well as their efficiency of transformation by activated ras. Our results suggest that p19ARF can interfere with oncogene-mediated transformation, without significantly affecting NIH3T3 cell growth, at least at the levels of expression achieved in these experiments.",

The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14(ARF) and p16. We now show that p14(ARF) (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REGγ. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knockdown of REGγ or by pharmacologic blockade of its nuclear export. Thus, our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of 2 key tumor suppressors mediated by a REGγ-dependent mechanism. The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell-cycle function.;The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell cycle function.

We previously demonstrated that this locus is altered in human skin carcinomas. In the present study we have studied the expression of the p16(INK4A-ARF) locus following UVB irradiation of normal human keratinocytes both at the mRNA (RT-PCR) and at the protein (Western blotting) levels. Our data confirmed that P16(INK4A) protein is induced by UVB at low (30 mJ cm(2)) and high (100 mJ cm(2)) doses and is observed after a single or repeated exposure implying that this response is involved in both the immediate and adaptative response to UVB. The apparent absence of induction p16(INK4A) mRNA suggested that P16(INK4A) protein is upregulated at the post-transcriptional level. Analysis by flow cytometry and BrdU staining indicated that the highest protein level of P16(INK4A) in the cells was associated with a G(2) cell cycle arrest. Comparative analysis of P16(INK4A) and P53 showed that they were differentially modulated in keratinocytes according to the UVB dose and regimen. Low, acute or repeated UVB exposures led to accumulation of both P16(INK4A) and p53, whereas at high UVB doses, P53 and P53-dependent genes were not induced or even downregulated and only a slight but reproducible stabilization of P16(INK4A) protein was observed. In our conditions, P14(ARF) did not seem to participate in the UV response in these cells as P14(ARF) protein did not vary. These results infer that P16(INK4A) plays a role in cell cycle regulation of keratinocytes submitted to UVB irradiation. They also reinforce our previous demonstration of the importance of inactivation of this gene in UV-induced skin carcinogenesis.",

We analyzed families with two or more cases of melanoma for germline mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 to elucidate the contribution of these gene defects to familial malignant melanoma and to the occurrence of other cancer types.;: The entire CDKN2A coding region and exon 2 of the CDK4 gene of an affected member of each of 52 families from southern Sweden with at least two cases of melanoma in first- or second-degree relatives were screened for mutations by use of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided.;: CDKN2A mutations were found in 10 (19%) of the 52 families. Nine families carried an identical alteration consisting of the insertion of arginine at position 113 of p16(INK4a), and one carried a missense mutation, in which the valine at position 115 was replaced with a glycine. The 113insArg mutant p16(INK4a) was unable to bind cdk4 and cdk6 in an in vitro binding assay. Six of the 113insArg families had at least one member with multiple primary melanomas; the 113insArg families also had a high frequency of other malignancies-in particular, breast cancer (a total of eight cases compared with the expected 2.1; P =.0014) and pancreatic cancer (a total of six cases compared with the expected 0.16; P<.0001). Families with breast cancer also had a propensity for multiple melanomas in females, suggesting that a sex-dependent factor may modify the phenotypic expression of CDKN2A alterations.;: Our findings confirm that the majority of CDKN2A-associated melanoma families in Sweden are due to a single founder mutation.

Therefore, both can become methylated de novo and silenced. It has recently been proposed that the methylation changes in certain genes could be used as molecular markers for the detection of almost all forms of human cancer. Here, we analyzed concomitantly in each tumor sample and normal tissue the methylation status of p16INK4a and p14ARF by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in 100 breast, 95 colon and 27 bladder carcinomas. A series of clinicopathological parameter were obtained from the medical records of the patients, p14ARF showed a higher rate of hypermethylation than p16INK4a in all three tumor types. p16INK4a and p14ARF aberrant methylation was significantly correlated with poor prognosis clinicopathological parameters of the three tumor types.

We investigated their role in the pathogenesis of 9 bile tract cancer cell lines and 21 primary sporadic extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas. p53 and p16 protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Mutation screening of p53 was done by SSCP and direct sequencing. Inactivating mechanisms of p14 and p16 were addressed by screening for mutations, homozygous deletions, chromosomal loss of 9p21 (loss of heterozygosity [LOH] analysis) and promoter hypermethylation of the p14/p16 genes. p53 overexpression could be detected in 7 of 9 cell lines and 7 of 21 primary tumors, but mutations were found in 3 cell lines only. p16 expression was absent in all cell lines, due to homozygous deletion of the gene in 8 of 9 cell lines and hypermethylation of the p16 promoter in one cell line (CC-LP-1). p14 exon 1beta was homozygously deleted in 6 of 9 cell lines, while retained in CC-LP-1 and 2 additional lines. No p14 promoter hypermethylation could be detected. p16 expression was lost in 11 of 21 primary tumors. p16 promoter hypermethylation was present in 9 of 21 primary tumors, all with lost p16 expression. Allelic loss at 9p21 was detected in 13 of 21 primary tumors, 10 of 11 with lost p16 expression and 8 of 9 with methylated p16 promoter. No p14 promoter hypermethylation or p14/p16 mutations could be detected. Neither Tp53 nor p16 alterations showed obvious association with histopathologic or clinical characteristics. In conclusion, inactivation of the p16 gene is a frequent event in primary sporadic extrahepatic bile duct cancers, 9p21 LOH and promoter hypermethylation being the principal inactivating mechanisms. Therefore, p16, but not p14, seems to be the primary target of inactivation at the INK4a locus in bile duct cancers. Other mechanisms than Tp53 mutations seems to be predominantly responsible for stabilization of nuclear p53 protein in bile duct cancers.",

The level of Bmi-1 mRNA in the carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than those of the adjacent non-neoplastic colonic mucosal tissues. Immunohistochemistry for Bmi-1 showed moderate or strong expression levels in 65% (30/46) of colorectal carcinomas. Colorectal carcinomas with moderate or strong Bmi-1 expression were more likely to have low levels of the INK4 locus proteins (p16INK4a/p14ARF) (P<0.07).

Direct sequence analysis revealed p53 mutations (that is, at codons 224, 234, and 294) in three tumors (14%) and p16INK4a mutations (that is, at codon 6) in one (5%). No mutations were detected in Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, N-Ras, c-Kit, or p14ARF. On the other hand, methylation-specific PCR revealed methylation of p14ARF promoter DNA in eight of 19 analyzable tumor samples (42%) and p16INK4a promoter DNA in one of 19 analyzable tumor samples (5%). Together, these findings suggest that p14ARF silencing may be an important mechanism in MCC tumorigenesis, and thus a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this highly aggressive tumor type.",

We have analysed CDKN2 coding sequences in 15 Dutch familial atypical multiple mole-melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome pedigrees, and identified a 19 basepair (bp) germline deletion in 13 of them. All 13 families originate from an endogamous population. The deletion causes a reading frame shift, predicted to result in a severely truncated p16 protein. Interestingly, two family members are homozygous for the deletion, one of whom shows no obvious signs of disease. This surprising finding demonstrates that homozygotes for this CDKN2 mutation are viable, and suggests the presence of a genetic mechanism that can compensate for the functional loss of p16.

Furthermore, the interdependence of these mechanisms was examined, since it has been reported that p14ARF is altered in most tumours in concordance with p16INK4a. The results show that promoter hypermethylation, tested by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), was the major mechanism of inactivation of these genes and was present in 31 (31%) and 50 (50%) of the tumours that showed decreased p16INK4a and p14ARF expression, respectively. Hemizygous deletion was the second cause of down-regulation. Homozygous deletion was rare and mutation was absent. In most tumours overexpressing p16INK4a or p14ARF, no detectable inactivation mechanisms were observed. Finally, the results indicate that these proteins are often co-altered in primary breast tumours and that p16INK4a and p14ARF had non-independent behaviour, since they were silenced or overexpressed concomitantly with a significant correlation (p < 0.05).",

In this study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the Cdkn2a locus, common to the Ink4a and Arf genes, was performed on 33 radon-induced rat lung tumors and showed a DNA loss in 50% of cases. The analysis of p16(Ink4a) protein expression by immunohistochemistry revealed that 50% of the tumors were negative for this protein. Looking for the origin of this lack of expression, we observed a low frequency of homozygous deletion (6%), a lack of mutation, an absence of correlation between promoter methylation and Ink4a mRNA expression and no correlation between LOH and protein expression. However, a tendency for an inverse correlation between p16(Ink4a) and pRb protein expression was observed. The expressions of p19Arf, Mmd2 and Mdm4 were not deregulated and only 14% of the tumors were mutated for Tp53. These results indicated that Ink4a/Cdk4/Rb1 pathway deregulation, more than Arf/Mdm2/Tp53 pathway, has a major role in the development of these tumors through p16(Ink4a) deregulation.

Azidothymidine (AZT) is being tested in several clinical trials as an enhancer of anticancer chemotherapy.

We found that endogenous p14(ARF) protein in OVCAR-3 cells is down-regulated by DTX but induced by AZT and a short CDDP pulse treatment. In HT-29 colon carcinoma cells with a mutated p53, all treatments down-regulated p14(ARF) protein. Both CDDP and AZT increased the expression of p14ARF mRNA in OVCAR-3 cells. Differences in cell death induced by these drugs did not explain the differences in protein and mRNA expressions. No increase in the level of either c-Myc or H-ras oncoproteins was seen in OVCAR-3 cells after AZT or CDDP-treatment.

To test this assumption, we have examined the effects of DAC in two human cancer cell lines of differing INK4a/ARF promoter methylation status: MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in which INK4a/ARF is unmethylated and normally expressed, and DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells in which INK4a/ARF is methylated and repressed. In MDA-MB-468 cells, DAC induces cytotoxicity in the absence of any detectable increase of p14 or p16 expression, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of p16/p14 expression fails to attenuate DAC cytotoxicity. In DLD-1 cells, DAC demethylates INK4a/ARF and restores both p16 and p14 expression at concentrations that fail to cause detectable growth inhibition or apoptosis; moreover, neither ARF nor INK4a transgene expression inhibits DLD-1 cell growth despite normalization of p14 and p16 expression. These data imply that neither of these cell lines depends on up-regulated expression of INK4a/ARF for DAC cytotoxicity.

Here we show that Runx2-deficient primary osteoblasts fail to undergo senescence as indicated by the absence of beta-gal activity and p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor expression. Primary Runx2-null osteoblasts have a growth advantage and exhibit loss of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p19(ARF) expression. Reintroduction of WT Runx2, but not a subnuclear targeting-defective mutant, induces both p21(WAF/CIP1) and p19(ARF) mRNA and protein resulting in cell-cycle inhibition. Accumulation of spontaneous phospho-H2A.X foci, loss of telomere integrity and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 DNA repair complex, and a delayed DNA repair response all indicate that Runx2 deficiency leads to genomic instability. We propose that Runx2 functions as a tumor suppressor in primary diploid osteoblasts and that subnuclear targeting contributes to Runx2-mediated tumor suppression.",

Human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), normal fibroblasts (Hs68 and WI38), HeLa cervical carcinoma and HTB-30 breast carcinoma cells arrest in G(1)/S in response to severe hypoxia. Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells did not exhibit orderly G(1)/S arrest in response to severe hypoxia. We found a general decrease in p16(INK4a) (p16) mRNA levels, with an associated decrease in p16 protein levels in both normal cells and in cancer cells, regardless of their cell cycle response to hypoxia. p27 protein levels did not correlate with the cell line's ability to enter a hypoxic G(1)/S arrest. Furthermore, cell lines that underwent G(1)/S arrest showed decreased expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha) and at least one member of INK4 or Sdi cell cycle kinase inhibitors families after 12-24 h of hypoxia. Conversely, Hep3B, which did not exhibit orderly hypoxia-associated G(1)/S arrest, also did not show decreased HIF-1alpha, INK4 or Sdi protein levels in hypoxia. Furthermore, Hep3B showed constitutive activating phosphorylation of Akt and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3beta, which was the opposite pattern to that exhibited by the cell lines showing the G(1)/S arrest phenotype. Inhibition of GSK3beta by lithium chloride treatment of HeLa cells converted the HIF-1alpha, p16 and p27 loss to levels unchanged by hypoxic exposure. Our results suggest that regulation of the cell cycle during hypoxia in either normal or cancer cells is not simply due to up-regulation of cell cycle kinase inhibitors.

To explore the biological basis for these genetic interactions, we studied cellular responses to oncogenic ras in primary murine keratinocytes. In wild-type keratinocytes, ras induced a cell-cycle arrest that displayed some features of terminal differentiation and was accompanied by increased expression of the p19(ARF), p16(INK4a), and p53 tumor suppressors. In ARF-null keratinocytes, ras was unable to promote cell-cycle arrest, induce differentiation markers, or properly activate p53. Although oncogenic ras produced a substantial increase in both nucleolar and nucleoplasmic p19(ARF), Mdm2 did not relocalize to the nucleolus or to nuclear bodies but remained distributed throughout the nucleoplasm. This result suggests that p19(ARF) can activate p53 without overtly affecting Mdm2 subcellular localization. Nevertheless, like p53-null keratinocytes, ARF-null keratinocytes were transformed by oncogenic ras and rapidly formed carcinomas in vivo. Thus, oncogenic ras can activate the ARF-p53 program to suppress epithelial cell transformation. Disruption of this program may be important during skin carcinogenesis and the development of other carcinomas.",

The initiation of prostate malignancy and progression to a castration-resistant stage are largely contributed by the modulation of AR activity through its coregulatory proteins. We and others previously reported that p14 alternative reading frame (ARF) expression is positively correlated with the disease progression and severity of PCa. Here, we provide evidence that p14ARF physically interacts with AR and functions as an AR corespressor in both an androgen-dependent and androgen-independent manner. Endogenous ARF (p14ARF in human and p19ARF in mouse) and AR colocalize in both human PCa cells in vitro and PCa tissues of mouse and human in vivo. Overexpression of p14ARF in PCa cells significantly attenuates the activities of androgen response region (ARR2)-probasin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoters. The forced expression of p14ARF in cells resulted in a suppression of PSA and NK transcription factor locus 1 (NKX3.1) expression. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous p14ARF in human PCa cells with short hairpin RNA enhanced AR transactivation activities in a dose-dependent and p53-independent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p14ARF binds to both the N-terminal domain and the ligand-binding domain of AR, and the human double minute 2 (HDM2)-binding motif of p14ARF is required for the interaction of p14ARF and AR proteins. p14ARF perturbs the androgen-induced interaction between the N terminus and C terminus of AR. Most importantly, we observed that the expression of PSA is reversely correlated with p14ARF in human prostate tissues. Taken together, our results reveal a novel function of ARF in modulation of AR transactivation in PCa.",

Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF)1A2 as a novel interacting partner of p16(INK4a). eEF1A2 is thought to function as an oncogene in cancers. The p16(INK4a) protein interacted with all but the D2 (250-327 aa) domain of eEF1A2. Ectopic expression of p16(INK4a) decreased the expression of eEF1A2 and inhibited cancer cell growth. Furthermore, suppression of protein synthesis by expression of p16(INK4a) ex vivo was verified by luciferase reporter activity. Microinjection of p16(INK4a) mRNA into the cytoplasm of Xenopus embryos suppressed the luciferase mRNA translation, whereas the combination of p16(INK4a) and morpholino-eEF1A2 resulted in a further reduction in translational activity.

Maintaining VEGFA expression relies on nucleophosmin/B23, and downregulating this protein by RNAi or p19(ARF) leads to translational repression of VEGFA. p19(ARF) inhibits VEGFA-dependent tumor angiogenesis in nude mice. Additionally, p14(ARF) expression and microvessel density are inversely correlated in human colon carcinomas. Taken together, our results define a mechanism by which the ARF tumor suppressor targets the translational repression of specific oncogenes during neoplastic transformation.",

Despite the implementation of pap smear screening, many women are still diagnosed only in the advanced stage of cervical cancer. This could partly be due to failure of detection of its precursor lesions; hence the need to search for novel biomarkers to assist in the screening and diagnosis of cervical neoplasia. This study aims to determine the expression of p16INK4A and survivin as possible predictive biomarkers in cervical squamous neoplasm.;This is a retrospective study on 201 cases of cervical neoplasm comprising of 129 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 72 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). All samples were evaluated by two independent observers using p16INK4A and survivin monoclonal antibodies. The p16 INK4A expression was graded as negative, focal and diffuse positivity. The intensity for survivin expression was graded as weak, moderate and intense.;It is seen that p16 INK4A expression in CIN 1, CIN 2 and CIN 3 were 25.4%, 42.9% and 95.9% respectively. Majority of SCC (98.6%) showed p16 INK4A expression. Survivin expressions in CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3 and SCC were 56.7%, 33.4%, 87.5% and 98.6%. There was a linear relationship between increasing grade of CIN and p16 INK4A expressions.;Our study showed that p16 INK4A expressions correlate well with the increasing grade of CIN. Although survivin does not correlate well to the increasing grade of CIN, it could be useful in differentiating CIN 3 from SCC.",

Recent evidence has shown that P14ARF binds to MDM2 leading to an increased availability of wild type TP53 protein. Functional studies also support a putative tumor suppressor gene function for p14ARF suggesting that p14ARF or p53 inactivation may be functionally equivalent in tumorigenesis. To study the relative contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis, we analysed and compared alterations of the p16, p14ARF and p53 genes in 38 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (19 adenocarcinomas and 19 squamous carcinoma). The p16 tumor suppressor gene was inactivated in 22 of 38 (58%) tumors. Twelve of these samples (31%) had homozygous deletions by microsatellite analysis; eight of them (21%) had p16 promoter hypermethylation detected by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) and the remaining two (5%) harbored a point mutation in exon 2 by sequence analysis. The absence of P16 protein in every case was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Fourteen of the 22 tumors with p16 inactivation also inactivated the p14ARF gene (12 with homozygous deletions extending into INK4a/ARF and two with exon 2 mutations). Mutations of p53 were found in 18 (47%) of the tumors and nine of them (50%) harbored p14ARF inactivation. Thus, an inverse correlation was not found between p14ARF and p53 genetic alterations (P=0.18; Fisher Exact Test). Our data confirm that the p16 gene is frequently inactivated in NSCLC. Assuming that 9p deletion occurs first, the common occurrence of p53 and p14ARF alterations suggests that p14ARF inactivation is not functionally equivalent to abrogation of the TP53 pathway by p53 mutation.",

The quantitative methylation value was expressed as the percentage of methylated reference (PMR).;The median level of p16(INK4) methylation was 0.55 PMR (range 0.00-503.4). The p16(INK4) methylation value was significantly higher in males (p = 0.005) and in squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.018). Prognostic analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model showed that the p16(INK4a) methylation value was a significant prognostic factor (odds ratio, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.008; p < 0.0001).

DNA hypermethylation profiles differ significantly by HPV status suggesting that a specific subset of methylated CpG loci could give mechanistic insight into HPV-driven OPSCC. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation of primary tumor samples and adjacent normal mucosa from 46 OPSCC patients undergoing treatment at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 beadchip. For each matched tissue set, we measured differentially methylated CpG loci using a change in methylation level (M value). From these analyses, we identified a 22 CpG loci panel for HPV+ OPSCC that included four CDKN2A loci downstream of the p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) transcription start sites. This panel was significantly associated with overall HPV detection (P < 0.05; ROC area under the curve = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.0) similar to the subset of four CDKN2A-specific CpG loci (0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.99) with equivalence to the full 22 CpG panel. DNA hypermethylation correlated with a significant increase in alternative open reading frame (ARF) expression in HPV+ OPSCC primary tumors, but not to the other transcript variant encoded by the CDKN2A locus.

Here we report a novel deletion/substitution from CC to T in the shared exon 2 of p14ARF/p16 in a melanoma cell line. This mutation aligns the reading frames of p14ARF and p16 mid-transcript, producing one protein which is half p14ARF and half p16, chimera ARF (chARF), and another which is half p16 and half non-p14ARF/non-p16 amino acids, p16-Alternate Carboxyl Terminal (p16-ACT). In an effort to understand the cellular impact of this novel mutation and others like it, we expressed the two protein products in a tumor cell line and analyzed common p14ARF and p16 pathways, including the p53/p21 and CDK4/cyclin D1 pathways, as well as the influence of the two proteins on growth and the cell cycle. We report that chARF mimicked wild-type p14ARF by inducing the p53/p21 pathway, inhibiting cell growth through G2/M arrest and maintaining a certain percentage of cells in G1 during nocodazole-induced G2 arrest. chARF also demonstrated p16 activity by binding CDK4. However, rather than preventing cyclin D1 from binding CDK4, chARF stabilized this interaction through p21 which bound CDK4. p16-ACT had no p16-related function as it was unable to inhibit cyclin D1/CDK4 complex formation and was unable to arrest the cell cycle, though it did inhibit colony formation. We conclude that these novel chimeric proteins, which are very similar to predicted p16/p14ARF chimeric proteins found in other primary cancers, result in maintained p14ARF-p53-p21 signaling while p16-dependent CDK4 inhibition is lost.

In contrast to the rescue associated with p53 deficiency, Ink4a/Arf deficiency did not attenuate the degenerative phenotypes elicited by telomere dysfunction in the late-generation mTerc-/- mice. Furthermore, in contrast to accelerated cancer onset and increased epithelial cancers of late-generation mTerc-/- p53 mutant mice, late-generation mTerc-/- Ink4a/Arf mutant mice experienced a delayed tumor onset and maintained the lymphoma and sarcoma spectrum. Consistent with the negligible role of Ink4a/Arf in the telomere checkpoint response in vivo, late-generation mTerc-/- Ink4a/Arf-/- tissues show activated p53, and derivative tumor cell lines sustain frequent loss of p53 function, whereas all early generation mTerc Ink4a/Arf-/- tumor cell lines remain intact for p53. In addition, the late-generation mTerc-/- Ink4a/Arf-/- tumors showed activation of the alternative lengthening of telomere mechanism, underscoring the need for adaptation to the presence of telomere dysfunction in the absence of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf).

Inactivation of p16 is a common finding in many cancers; however, there is little data on CDKN2A gene abnormalities in oral precancer. In this longitudinal study, we examined changes in the CDKN2A gene locus in sequential epithelial dysplasias and oral carcinomas from 11 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from laser-microdissected lesional tissue, and exons 1alpha, 1beta, and 2 were analyzed by duplex PCR. Immunohistochemistry was done to identify p16 and p14ARF protein expression. Two adjacent polymorphic microsatellite markers were used for allelotyping. Homozygous deletion of exon 1alpha was identified in 2 of 17 (12%) precancerous lesions. Loss of either exon 1alpha, exon 2, or both was seen in seven of nine (78%) carcinomas. In five of these carcinomas, there was loss of only exon 1alpha. No case showed deletion of exon 1beta. In 5 of 11 patients, microsatellite markers showed differing patterns of allelic imbalance in the precancerous lesions and the subsequent carcinoma, suggesting a complex genetic pattern of progression from dysplasia to carcinoma. We conclude that during oral carcinogenesis homozygous deletion of exon 1alpha of the CDKN2A gene is common but that deletion of exon 2 and 1beta is less frequent. Moreover, our results suggest that the progression from oral precancer to cancer, in some cases, is more complex genetically than predicted by linear models of carcinogenesis.",

Many genes that regulate the critical cell cycle checkpoint at G1S are altered in human tumors. These genetic changes can result in uncontrolled cellular proliferation, genetic instability, and altered response to radiation and chemotherapy. The p53 tumor suppressor gene serves a critical role at the G1S transition, where it can either block entry into S phase or activate programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to DNA damage. p53 Gene mutations are common in human tumors and interfere with the activation of apoptosis in response to most chemotherapeutic agents. Paclitaxel is a potent chemotherapeutic agent that interferes with mitotic spindle function to block cells at G2M, the most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle. Utilization of paclitaxel as a radiation sensitizer in vivo to treat aggressive, locally advanced neoplasms has resulted in high response rates and acceptable toxicity in protocols for non-small cell lung carcinoma, upper gastrointestinal tract carcinoma, and other malignancies. Recent evidence suggests that paclitaxel is unique in its ability to activate apoptosis in tumor cells with p53 mutations in vitro and in vivo. The p16(INK4a) (MTS-1, CDKN2) gene product acts in the same pathway as p53 to inhibit cell cycle progression at G1/S. p16(INK4a) is deleted and/or mutated in a significant fraction of human tumors, including pancreatic carcinoma. The effects of p16(INK4a) alterations in response to paclitaxel/radiation and the risk of systemic relapse are currently being evaluated. Information about molecular genetic alterations in individual tumors ultimately may be a critical factor in choosing between therapeutic options.",

We report that p14ARF is epigenetically inactivated in several colorectal cell lines, and its expression is restored by treatment with demethylating agents. In primary colorectal carcinomas, p14ARF promoter hypermethylation was found in 31 of 110 (28%) of the tumors and observed in 13 of 41 (32%) colorectal adenomas but was not present in any normal tissues. p14ARF methylation appears in the context of an adjacent unmethylated p16INK4a promoter in 16 of 31 (52%) of the carcinomas methylated at p14ARF. Although p14ARF hypermethylation was slightly overrepresented in tumors with wild-type p53 compared to tumors harboring p53 mutations [19 of 55 (34%) versus 12 of 55 (22%)], this difference did not reach statistical significance. p14ARF aberrant methylation was not related to the presence of K-ras mutations.

Additionally, diverse patterns of p16(INK4) expression can complicate interpretation of \"p16(INK4a) -positivity\". These aspects impede the unrestricted application of p16(INK4a) as a diagnostic marker in the head and neck. We hypothesized that combined detection of p16(INK4a) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 could support clarification of ambiguous p16(INK4a) expression in the head and neck by specifically indicating p16(INK4a) -expressing cells with proliferative activity. p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression in a combined staining procedure was correlated to distinct p16(INK4a) expression patterns and HPV status (HPV DNA followed by E6*I oncogene mRNA detection) in 147 HNSCC and 50 non-malignant head and neck samples. p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression only occurred in transformed cells of the head and neck. Co-expression was never detected in non-transformed cells. Combined p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 expression was stringently associated with a diffuse p16(INK4a) expression pattern. All HPV oncogene-expressing HNSCC showed p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression. We demonstrate that p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression occurs exclusively in transformed cells of the head and neck.

Methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region is an important avenue for inactivation of p16. The mechanism of methylation of the p16 promoter region, however, has not been elucidated. Recent reports investigating p16 methylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) suggest that carcinogens in tobacco smoke induce the DNA methylation process. We investigated the association between methylation of the p16 promoter region and exposure to tobacco smoke in 185 primary NSCLCS: We also studied the relationship of p16 methylation with mutation of the K-ras and p53 genes, as well as with methylation at the DAP-kinase and p14(ARF) loci. Finally, we evaluated the prognostic significance of p16 methylation in NSCLC. The prevalence of p16 methylation was greater in squamous cell carcinoma (41%) compared with adenocarcinoma (22%; P = 0.03; Fisher's exact test). Methylation of p16 was significantly associated with pack-years smoked (P = 0.007; Wilcoxon rank sum test), duration of smoking (P = 0.0009; Wilcoxon rank sum test), and negatively with the time since quitting smoking (P = 0.03; Wilcoxon rank sum test). No methylation of the nearby p14(ARF) locus was detected, and methylation of the DAP-kinase locus was not associated with either p16 methylation or with exposure to tobacco smoke. In patients with stage 1 adenocarcinoma, p16 methylation was an independent risk factor predicting significantly shorter postsurgery survival (P = 0.03), controlling for the significant effects of other factors, including K-ras mutation. These findings suggest that methylation of CpG islands in tobacco-associated cancers occurs in a gene- and tissue-specific manner and is induced directly or indirectly by exposure to tobacco smoke in NSCLC.",

Three mutants (D84V, D84G, and R87P) had defects in CDK binding, kinase inhibition, and cell cycle arrest. The corresponding mutations are located in the third ankyrin repeat in a highly conserved region believed to form the CDK binding cleft. Three mutants (P48L, D74N, and R87L) had defects in kinase inhibition and cell cycle arrest. Among the 10 mutants with normal CDK binding and inhibitory activity, three mutants (N71S, R80L, and H83Y) had defects only in their ability to induce cell cycle arrest. Thus, p16 mutant proteins that retain CDK4 and CDK6 binding may have more subtle functional defects. All nine mutations leading to functional impairments mapped to the central portion of the p16 protein.

This study aimed to profile aberrant DNA methylation in different stages of liver disease, namely noncirrhosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and also to clarify the influence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the aberrant DNA methylation in HCCs. Promoter methylation in p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) and E-cadherin (E-Cad) genes of 58 HCCs paired with adjacent nontumorous tissues was assayed by methylation-specific PCR. HBV infection was determined using a hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) serological assay. The frequency of p16(INK4a) promoter methylation increased from noncirrhotic, cirrhotic, to HCC tissues (noncirrhotic vs. HCC, p < 0.001), while that of GSTP1 promoter methylation increased in cirrhotic tissues compared to noncirrhotic ones (p = 0.029). The frequency of GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation is significantly higher in HCC than in nontumorous tissues (p = 0.022) from HBsAg-positive patients, but not the HBsAg-negative controls (p = 0.289). While the frequency of E-Cad promoter hypermethylation remained high in both nontumorous tissues and HCCs from HBsAg-positive patients (p = 0.438), it was lower in HCCs than in nontumorous tissues from HBsAg-negative patients (p = 0.002). In contrast, the frequency of p16(INK4a), MGMT and p14(ARF) promoter hypermethylation in HCCs was unrelated to HBsAg status. In conclusion, aberrant DNA methylation may begin at different stages of liver disease in a gene-dependent manner.

All cases with homozygous deletion of MTS1 or MTS2 had no or low levels of mRNA expression and similar low levels of expression were found in cases in which MTS2 was present but fully methylated. Thus hypermethylation of MTS2, in contrast to MTS1, is frequent in childhood ALL.

Previous studies have shown that expression of p16 in tissue biopsies of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, particularly when considered in combination with other markers such as Ki-67 and COX-2. Here, we evaluated how expression of p16 in breast tissue biopsies of women with atypical hyperplasia (AH), a putative precursor lesion to DCIS, is associated with subsequent development of cancer. p16 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in archival sections from 233 women with AH diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic. p16 expression in the atypical lesions was scored by percentage of positive cells and intensity of staining. We also studied coexpression of p16, with Ki-67 and COX-2, biomarkers of progression in AH. Risk factor and follow-up data were obtained via study questionnaire and medical records. Forty-seven patients (20%) developed breast cancer with a median follow-up of 14.5 years. Staining of p16 was increased in older patients relative to younger patients (P = 0.0025). Although risk of developing breast cancer was not associated with increased p16 expression, joint overexpression of Ki-67 and COX-2 was found to convey stronger risk of breast cancer in the first 10 years after diagnosis as compared with one negative marker (P < 0.01). However, the addition of p16 levels did not strengthen this association. p16 overexpression, either alone or in combination with COX-2 and Ki-67, does not significantly stratify breast cancer risk in women with AH.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Carcinoma of the uterine cervix is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been identified as the major etiological factor in cervical carcinogenesis. However, the time lag between HPV infection and the diagnosis of cancer indicates that multiple steps, as well as multiple factors, may be necessary for the development of cervical cancer. The development and progression of cervical carcinoma have been shown to be dependent on various genetic and epigenetic events, especially alterations in the cell cycle checkpoint machinery. In mammalian cells, control of the cell cycle is regulated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their essential activating coenzymes, the cyclins. Generally, CDKs, cyclins, and CDK inhibitors function within several pathways, including the p16(INK4A)-cyclin D1-CDK4/6-pRb-E2F, p21(WAF1)- p27(KIP1)-cyclinE-CDK2, and p14(ARF)-MDM2-p53 pathways. The results from several studies showed aberrant regulation of several cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin D, cyclin E, p16(INK4A), p21(WAF1), and p27(KIP1), as characteristic features of HPV- infected and HPV E6/E7 oncogene-expressing cervical carcinomas and their precursors. These data suggested further that interactions of viral proteins with host cellular proteins, particularly cell cycle proteins, are involved in the activation or repression of cell cycle progression in cervical carcinogenesis.",

In mice, downregulation of one of the polycomb genes, bmi-1, leads to neurological alterations and severe proliferative defects in lymphoid cells, whilst bmi-1 overexpression, together with upregulation of myc-1, induces lymphoma. An oncogenic function has been further supported in primary fibroblast studies where bmi-1 overexpression induces immortalization due to repression of p16/p19ARF, and where together with H-ras, it readily transforms MEFs. It was the aim of this study to assess the expression of bmi-1 in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in association with p16 and p14ARF (=human p19ARF). Tumours (48 resectable NSCLC (32 squamous, 9 adeno-, 2 large cell, 4 undifferentiated carcinomas and 1 carcinoid); stage I, 29, II, 7, III, 12; T1, 18, T2, 30; differentiation: G1 12, G2 19, G3 17) were studied by immunohistochemistry for protein expression and by comparative multiplex PCR for gene amplification analysis. In tumour-free, normal lung tissue from patients, weak - moderate bmi-1 staining was seen in some epithelial cells, lymphocytes, glandular cells and in fibroblasts, whereas blood, endothelial, chondrocytes, muscle cells and adipocytes did not exhibit any bmi-1 expression. In tumours, malignant cells were negative/weakly, moderately and strongly positive in 20, 22 and 6 cases, respectively. As assessed by multiplex PCR, bmi-1 gene amplification was not the reason for high-level bmi-1 expression. Tumours with moderate or strong bmi-1 expression were more likely to have low levels of p16 and p14ARF (P = 0.02). Similarly, tumours negative for both, p16 and p14ARF, exhibit moderate-strong bmi-1 staining. 58% of resectable NSCLC exhibit moderate-high levels of bmi-1 protein. The inverse correlation of bmi-1 and the INK4 locus proteins expression (p16/p14ARF) supports a possible role for bmi-1 misregulation in lung carcinogenesis.",

The p16(INK4a) member of the INK4 protein family is altered in a variety of cancers and structure-function studies of the INK4 proteins reveal that the vast majority of missense tumor-derived p16(INK4a) mutations reduce protein thermodynamic stability. Based on this observation, we used p18(INK4c) as a model to test the proposal that INK4 proteins with increased stability might have enhanced cell cycle inhibitory activity. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to prepare p18(INK4c) mutant proteins with a predicted increase in stability. Using this approach, we report the generation of three mutant p18(INK4C) proteins, F71N, F82Q, and F92N, with increased stability toward thermal denaturation of which the F71N mutant also showed an increased stability to chemical denaturation. The x-ray crystal structures of the F71N, F82Q, and F92N p18INK4C mutant proteins were determined to reveal the structural basis for their increased stability properties. Significantly, the F71N mutant also showed enhanced CDK6 interaction and cell cycle inhibitory activity in vivo, as measured using co-immunoprecipitation and transient transfection assays, respectively. These studies show that a structure-based approach to increase the thermodynamic stability of INK4 proteins can be exploited to prepare more biologically active molecules with potential applications for the development of molecules to treat p16(INK4a)-mediated cancers.",

We have designed a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) application to study homozygous deletion (HD) of CDKN2A/ARF in 186 urinary bladder cancer patients.;Real-time QPCR, based on simultaneous amplification of ARF and a reference gene, GAPDH, was developed and evaluated in three melanoma cell lines with HDs at the CDKN2A/ARF locus (IGR-1, SK-MEL-5, and WM-266-4). In addition, loss of heterozygosity was analyzed at the D9S942, D9S1748, and D12S99 markers. Mutation analysis of the CDKN2A/ARF gene was performed using single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. Results from the present investigation were combined with previous p53 analysis of the same urinary bladder neoplasms.;Real-time QPCR analysis showed 26 (14%) HDs, 22 (12%) hemizygous deletions, and 3 (2%) multiple duplications. Loss of heterozygosity was determined in 30 (22%) cases at the D9S942 locus, which is located between E1alpha and E1beta of the CDKN2A/ARF gene.

In order to study the effects of p14ARF expression in tumor cells, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing p14ARF cDNA (Adp14ARF). Adp14ARF infection of U2OS osteosarcoma cells which has wild type p53 and mutant p14ARF revealed high levels of p14 (ARF) expression within 24h. In addition, Adp14ARF-mediated expressing of p14 (ARF) was associated with increased levels of p53, p21, and mdm2 protein. Growth inhibition assays following Adp14ARF infection demonstrated that the growth of U2OS cells was inhibited relative to infection with control virus. Furthermore, TUNEL analysis as well as PARP cleavage assays demonstrated that Adp14ARF infection was associated with increased apoptosis in U2OS cell line and that it was associated with Adp14ARF induced overexpression of Fas and Fas-L. Addition of Fas-L neutralizing antibody NOK-1 decreased Adp14-mediated cell death, indicating that p14 (ARF) induction of the Fas pathway is associated with increased apoptosis. The finding that Adp14ARF infection did not induce Fas expression in U2OS/E6 and MCF/E6 cells suggests that wild type p53 expression may be necessary for Adp14ARF-mediated induction of Fas. The observation that overexpression of p53 by Adp53 infection in MCF-7 does not induce increased Fas protein levels nor apoptotic cell death suggests that p53 overexpression is required but not sufficient enough for apoptosis. These studies suggest there are other mechanisms other than induction of p53 in ARF-mediated apoptosis and gene therapy using Adp14ARF may be a promising treatment option for human cancers containing wild type p53 and mutant or deleted p14 expression.",

Ten cell lines and 32 tumors (38.5%) had homozygous deletion of at least one target. Thirteen tumors (15.7%) had deletion of all three targets.

In vitro, nuclear p14ARF binds Hdm2 to block Hdm2-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of p53, which is required before cytoplasmic degradation of p53. p14ARF is negatively regulated by p53 and through p53-independent pathways. No studies have yet examined levels of p14ARF protein expression in breast cancer and their relationship to Hdm2/p53 immunoreactivity or subcellular localisation. Previously, immunohistochemical expression of cytoplasmic p14ARF, p53 and Hdm2 has been described. HER-2 (c-erbB2/neu) predicts prognosis and interacts with the p14ARF/Hdm2 pathway to inactivate p14ARF and to influence Hdm2 activity and localisation. This study examined p14ARF and p53/Hdm2 expression and subcellular localisation by using immunohistochemistry in a series of invasive ductal breast cancers (IDCs) with concomitant ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), to evaluate whether findings in vitro were related to clinicopathological parameters such as HER-2 and their effect on patient outcome.;The 4C6 anti-p14ARF monoclonal antibody and Dako Envision Plus system were used to evaluate p14ARF expression in 103 patients; p53/Hdm2 staining was performed.;p14ARF was evaluable in 96 patients, with nuclear p14ARF expression (modified Quick-score > or = 3) in 79% (n = 76) of IDCs and in associated DCIS in 74 patients. Cytoplasmic p14ARF was detectable in 23 breast cancers. Nuclear and cytoplasmic p14ARF showed no correlation with p53 subcellular immunoreactivity. Increasing levels of cytoplasmic p14ARF were associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic Hdm2 expression (P < 0.001). Subcellular ARF expression was not associated with clinicopathological parameters, and although not an independent prognosticator, these preliminary findings suggest that cytoplasmic p14ARF might be associated with a better overall survival (P = 0.09; log rank). The association between HER-2 positivity and nuclear p14ARF (P = 0.038), as well as nuclear Hdm2 (P = 0.019), reflects the in vitro findings of HER-2 interaction with the ARF/Hdm2 pathway. Cytoplasmic p53 and Hdm2 expression might have biological implications, through an association of cytoplasmic p53 with increased tumour proliferation (P = 0.005), and an improved overall survival (P = 0.002, log rank) in cytoplasmic Hdm2-expressing tumours, that independently predict favourable overall survival (P = 0.02) and disease-free survival (P = 0.03).;Nuclear p14ARF expression is similar in IDCs and DCIS and is associated with Hdm2 immunoreactivity. Nuclear p14ARF and Hdm2 might be regulated by HER-2. Clearly, our findings in vivo suggest a complexity of p14ARF/Hdm2 and p53 pathways in which consideration of cytoplasmic p14ARF and Hdm2 might have tumorigenic implications.",

The INK4a/b locus is among the most frequently mutated in human cancer. This locus encodes three distinct tumor suppressors: p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and ARF (alternate reading frame). Although p15(INK4b) has its own ORF, p16(INK4a) and ARF share common second and third exons with alternative reading frames. Here, we show that, in the naked mole rat, the INK4a/b locus encodes an additional product that consists of p15(INK4b) exon 1 joined to p16(INK4a) exons 2 and 3. We have named this isoform pALT(INK4a/b) (for alternative splicing). We show that pALT(INK4a/b) is present in both cultured cells and naked mole rat tissues but is absent in human and mouse cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that pALT(INK4a/b) expression is induced during early contact inhibition and upon a variety of stresses such as UV, gamma irradiation-induced senescence, loss of substrate attachment, and expression of oncogenes. When overexpressed in naked mole rat or human cells, pALT(INK4a/b) has stronger ability to induce cell-cycle arrest than either p15(INK4b) or p16(INK4a). We hypothesize that the presence of the fourth product, pALT(INK4a/b) of the INK4a/b locus in the naked mole rat, contributes to the increased resistance to tumorigenesis of this species. ",

We have demonstrated previously that Ink4a/Arf-null colon tumors display increased growth and vascularity in C57Bl6 mice carrying the Min (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mutation. We present here an analysis in a mixed genetic background of Min colon tumors (N=215) in mice with or without selective deficiencies in p16 or Arf, respectively. Absence of Arf did not significantly alter tumor formation. In contrast, tumors in mice lacking p16 were moderately larger and redder. Histological analysis demonstrated that these tumors contained significantly more pockets of necrosis (p=0.02), a marker of carcinoma in situ; less apoptosis (p=0.02); and higher red blood cell density (p=0.02, 0.006 within vessels). Biochemical analyses demonstrated increased levels of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF, p<0.01). Exogenous p16 expression in human colon tumor cells in vitro inhibited VEGF production.

Mutational analysis of CDKN2 (p16) was performed to determine whether this gene was the target of such alterations. Of 21 tumors analyzed, only 1 showed a mutation of probable consequence, suggesting that CDKN2 appears not to be the target of loss of heterozygosity and indicating the possible existence of another tumor suppressor gene within this region. Additionally, since it has been suggested that some CDKN2 deletions and mutations could be due to an in vitro phenomenon, four immortal breast cell lines derived from normal epithelium, MCF10F, MCF12F, 184A1, and 184B5, were examined for loss or mutation of CDKN2. Two lines (MCF10F and MCF12F) showed homozygous deletions of CDKN2, and one (184A1) revealed a hemizygous deletion and a nonsense mutation in the remaining allele. This could imply an important role of CDKN2 in the control of immortalization or in vitro adaptation and is the first evidence of such in nontumor-derived cell lines.

ARF proteins interact with the E2F-1, -2 and -3 transcription activators to inhibit their transcriptional activity and induce their degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. The impact of ARF on the E2F proteins may provide a mechanism for p53-independent ARF activity on cell cycle progression and tumor susceptibility. In this report we explored the effects of ARF on E2F ubiquitination and degradation in relationship to cell cycle effects and p53 status. We now show that ARF induced the rapid ubiquitination and degradation of E2F-1 only in the presence of functional p53. E2F-1 continued to be ubiquitinated following ARF induction in cycling p53-wild-type, p21-null cells, showing that effects of ARF were not simply a result of p14ARF induced cell-cycle arrest.

Our recent investigations revealed that FOXA1 as a forkhead transcription factor mediates CDKN2A activation in cellular senescence. However, the contribution of this axis in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, using a comprehensive collection of cancer microarray data, we found FOXA1 is down-regulated in many cancers compared to their normal counterparts and the positive correlation between FOXA1 and CDKN2A could be observed in prostate and breast cancers with lower EZH2 (epigenetic repressor for CDKN2A) expression. Experimentally, epistasis analysis in prostate and breast cancer cells indicated that higher expression of FOXA1 opposes EZH2-mediated CDKN2A repression, as further depletion of FOXA1 reverts the de-silencing of CDKN2A caused by EZH2 inhibition. Concomitantly, EZH2-depletion suppresses cancer cell cycle progression and this regulation is optimized in the presence of FOXA1 and CDKN2A. A further oncogenic transformation assay suggested that overexpression of EZH2 is insufficient to block RAS-induced CDKN2A activation and loss of FOXA1 is mandatory to potentiate EZH2-mediated CDKN2A silencing and to bypass the senescence barrier. Importantly, using an in vitro histone methyltransferase (HMTase) system, we found FOXA1 directly inhibits EZH2's histone methyltransferase activity through its C-terminal histone binding motif. These data support that positive regulation of CDKN2A by FOXA1 counteracts its tumorigenic repression of by EZH2 in cancers. ",

We identified different combinations of pRb and p53 pathway alterations in 12 invasive transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) and addressed the functional significance of the different combinations observed. Results showed four combinations of alterations including -pRb/-p53 (ie., pRb inactivated in the pRb pathway and p53 inactivated in the p53 pathway; four TCCs), -p16/-p53 (four TCCs), -p16/-p21(WAF1) (one TCC), and -p16/ -p14(ARF) (two TCCs). These groups include two new combinations (ie., -p16/-p53 and -p16/-p21(WAF1)) not reported previously for TCCs. An alteration in the key components of the p53 pathway was not detected in one invasive TCC that had inactivated p16. Note that all four TCCs with inactivated pRb had mutant p53; thus, the combinations of -pRb/ -p21(WAF1) and -pRb/-p14(ARF) were not observed. Only two of eight TCCs with altered p16 had concomitant p14(ARF) loss, demonstrating that simultaneous inactivation of these two 9p21INK4a tumor suppressor genes is not obligatory. To determine the biological phenotypes of TCCs with different combinations of pRb and p53 pathway alterations, their downstream responses to gamma radiation were studied in vitro. As expected, none of eight TCCs with mutant p53 responded to gamma radiation by elevation of p53, p21(WAF1), or mdm2 or by cell cycle arrest. Only two of four TCCs with wild-type p53 and wild-type pRb (the combination of -p16/-p14(ARF)) showed normal downstream responses to gamma radiation and underwent cell cycle arrest. Two TCCs with wild-type pRb and wild-type p53 (the combination of -pl6/-p21(WAF1) and one TCC with -p16) failed to show cell cycle arrest in response to radiation. This was attributed to the absence of p21(WAF1) in one TCC.

To clarify the features of gastric cancers with promoter methylation of p16INK4a and p14ARF, we investigated the methylation status in gastric cancer cell lines and primary gastric cancers using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and correlated the methylation status with microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA ploidy pattern, p53 immunohistochemistry, and various clinicopathologic factors, paying attention to the correlations with the histologic types. Of 10 cell lines studied, silencing of the expression of p16INK4a and p14ARF due to promoter methylation was detected by MSP and RT-PCR in six (60%) and two (20%) cell lines, respectively. p14ARF silencing was detected only in cell lines derived from gastric cancer of the diffuse type, while p16INK4a silencing was found in cell lines derived from both diffuse and intestinal types. In 59 primary gastric cancers, promoter methylation of p16INK4a and p14ARF was found in 10 (17%) and 14 (24%) of the tumors independently, there being an association with DNA diploidy, but not with p53 immunohistochemistry. p16INK4a methylation was found irrespective of tumor stages and histology. Whereas p14ARF methylation was found more frequently in intestinal type cancers in an early stage and in diffuse type cancers in an advanced stage, MSI tended to be related especially to p14ARF methylation in cancers of the intestinal type.

Here, we show that in human fibroblasts undergoing replicative or oncogene-induced senescence, there is a marked decline in the levels of p18(INK4c) protein and RNA, which mirrors the accumulation of p16(INK4a). Downregulation of INK4c is not dependent on p16(INK4a), and RAS can promote the loss of INK4c without cell-cycle arrest. Downregulation of p18(INK4c) correlates with reduced expression of menin and E2F1 but is unaffected by acute cell-cycle arrest or inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Collectively, our data question the idea that p18(INK4c) acts as a backup for loss of p16(INK4a) and suggest that the apparent activation of p18(INK4c) in some settings represents delayed senescence rather than increased expression.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the immunohistochemical expression of p16 (INK4a) in 40 oropharynx and 35 larynx from HNSCC patients treated in a single institution and followed-up at least for 10 years in order to explore potential associations with clinicopathological outcomes and prognostic implications. Forty cases (53.3%) were positive for p16 (INK4a) and this expression was more intense in non-smoking patients (P = 0.050), whose tumors showed negative vascular embolization (P = 0.018), negative lymphatic permeation (P = 0.002), and clear surgical margins (P = 0.050). Importantly, on the basis of negative p16 (INK4a) expression, it was possible to predict a probability of lower survival (P = 0.055) as well as tumors presenting lymph node metastasis (P = 0.050) and capsular rupture (P = 0.0010). Furthermore, increased risk of recurrence was observed in tumors presenting capsular rupture (P = 0.0083). Taken together, the alteration in p16 (INK4a) appears to be a common event in patients with oropharynx and larynx squamous cell carcinoma and the negative expression of this protein correlated with poor prognosis.",

Current noninvasive tests such as cytology lack sufficient sensitivity to detect low-grade, low-stage tumors. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes, such as p16(INK4a), VHL, and the mismatch repair gene hMLH1, has established promoter hypermethylation as a common mechanism for tumor suppressor inactivation in human cancers. It is also a promising new target for molecular detection in bodily fluids including urine, a readily accessible fluid known to contain bladder cancer cells. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) can determine the presence or absence of methylation of a gene locus at a sensitivity level of up to 1 methylated allele in 1000 unmethylated alleles, appropriate for identifying cancer cell DNA in a bodily fluid.;We first determined the frequency of hypermethylation of the Rb tumor suppressor gene by bisulfite sequencing and of the p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), APC, and RASSF1A tumor suppressor genes by MSP in 45 bladder cancers. We then designed a panel optimal for diagnostic coverage composed of the APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF) tumor suppressor genes. This panel was tested for detection of hypermethylation in matched sediment DNA from urine specimens obtained before surgery from the same 45 bladder cancer patients (2 Tis, 16 Ta, 10 T1, and 17 T2-4) as well as normal and benign control DNAs.;Hypermethylation of at least one of three suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF)) was found in all 45 tumor DNAs (100% diagnostic coverage). We detected gene hypermethylation in the matched urine DNA from 39 of 45 patients (87% sensitivity), including 16 cases that had negative cytology. No hypermethylation of APC, RASSF1A, or p14(ARF) was observed in normal transitional cell DNAs or in urine DNAs from normal healthy individuals and patients with inflammatory urinary disease (cystitis). Furthermore, an unmethylated gene in the tumor DNA was always found to be unmethylated in the matched urine DNA (100% specificity).;Promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is common in bladder cancer and was found in all grades and stages of tumors examined. Hypermethylation was detected in the urine DNA from 39 of 45 (87%) patients, including cases of early-stage disease amenable to cure.

Both genes are mapped on chromosome 9p21. Previous studies have suggested that the p16 gene has important roles in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. To clarify carcinogenesis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we examined 44 primary OSCCs for alterations of p16 and p14ARF mRNA expression, the methylation status of the p16 gene promoter, the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 9p21 locus, and p16 and p14ARF gene mutations. Alterations of p16 and p14ARF mRNA expression were seen in 27 (61.4%) of 44 and 10 (22.7%) of 44 of OSCC samples, respectively. Methylation of the p16 gene promoter region was detected in 28 (63.6%) of 44 samples, and LOH at 9p21 locus was found in 30 (68.2%) of 44. p16 and p14ARF gene mutations were observed in 4 (9.0%) of 44 and 2 (4.5%) of 44 samples, respectively. Suspected homozygous deletion (HD) was seen in 9 (20.5%) of 44. All cases except one (97.7%) showed alterations in p16, p14ARF, and their locus. These data indicate that the status of p16 and p14ARF genes in OSCC is frequently influenced by methylation, gene mutation, and allelic deletions.

We retrospectively analyzed the mRNA levels of SUV39H1 and the promoter methylation of the p14(ARF), p16(INK4a) and HLTF genes as well as the mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in fresh frozen tissues from 219 colorectal cancer patients. The mRNA levels of the SUV39H1 and DNMT1 were assessed via quantitative real-time PCR and the methylation profiles of the CpG islands were determined using methylation-specific PCR. The mRNA levels of SUV39H1 and DNMT1 were elevated in 25% and 42% of 219 colorectal cancers, respectively. The hypermethylation of the p14(ARF), p16(INK4a) and HLTF genes occurred in 36%, 51% and 34% of the patients. The elevated mRNA levels of SUV39H1 were not associated with the hypermethylation of the 3 genes. However, the mRNA levels of DNMT1 were significantly different between patients with elevated mRNA levels of SUV39H1 and those without (1.62 +/- 0.84, 0.91 +/- 0.81, respectively; p = 0.007). Patients with elevated mRNA levels of SUV39H1 showed a higher prevalence of DNMT1 elevation than those without (61 vs. 35%, p = 0.0008).

Using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, high-stage muscle invasive TCC expressed the Rb, p16 and CDK4 mRNA at lower levels than low-stage superficial cancers, indicating down-regulation to be linked with tumor progression. The drop of the expression in the group of grade 2 TCC when invading the muscle layer compared to grade 2 carcinomas with a superficial pattern of growth is considered to represent a key event in promoting urothelial carcinogenesis in this subset of carcinomas. The protein expression of the Rb gene evaluated by immunohistochemistry proved to be closely related to the tumor grades and stages as well as to the mRNA expression, high-grade and high-stage TCC disclosing a lower rate of positive immunoreactivity than low-grade and low-stage carcinomas. The p16 protein product was expressed at a lower level in grade 3 than in grade 1 TCC, but there was no correlation with the tumor stages or the mRNA expression. TCC with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the INK4A region showed a decreased expression of p16 mRNA compared to those without an allelic loss. Tobacco smoke was not identified to substantially modulate the Rb/p16/CDK4 pathways, except for a ten-fold elevated mRNA expression of the p16 gene in TCC of light compared to heavy smokers. Heavy coffee consumption was associated with a reduced expression of CDK4 mRNA. Among occupational exposures, TCC of patients in contact with stone dust, paints and lacquer, plastics, wood and wood preservers and chemical solvents and adhesives displayed altered partly elevated, partly reduced levels of Rb, p16 and CDK4 mRNA compared to non-exposed subjects.

The unusual genomic relationship of the open reading frames of these proteins initially fueled speculation that only one of the two was the true tumor suppressor, and loss of the other merely coincidental in cancer. Recent human and mouse genetic data, however, have firmly established that both proteins possess significant in vivo tumor suppressor activity, although there appear to be species- and cell-type specific differences between the two. For example, ARF plays a clear role in preventing Myc-induced lymphomagenesis in mice, whereas the role for p16(INK4a) is human carcinomas is more firmly established. In this review, I discuss the evolutionary history of the locus, the relative importance of these tumor suppressor genes in human cancer, and recent information suggesting novel biochemical and physiologic functions of these proteins in vivo.",

The members of INK4 family, comprising p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), p18(INK4c), and p19(INK4d), block the progression of the cell cycle by binding to either Cdk4 or Cdk6 and inhibiting the action of cyclin D. These INK4 proteins share a similar structure dominated by several ankyrin repeats. Although they appear to be structurally redundant and equally potent as inhibitors, the INK4 family members are differentially expressed during mouse development. The striking diversity in the pattern of expression of INK4 genes suggested that this family of cell cycle inhibitors might have cell lineage-specific or tissue-specific functions. The INK4 proteins are commonly lost or inactivated by mutations in diverse types of cancer, and they represent established or candidate tumor suppressors. Apart from their capacity to arrest cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle they have been shown to participate in an increasing number of cellular processes. Given their emerging roles in fundamental physiological as well as pathological processes, it is interesting to explore the diverse roles for the individual INK4 family members in different functions other than cell cycle regulation. Extensive studies, over the past few years, uncover the involvement of INK4 proteins in senescence, apoptosis, DNA repair, and multistep oncogenesis.

The p14ARF transcript, which is an alternative spliced form of this locus, is also altered or deleted in a proportion of human lung cancers and has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression as an endogenous cellular regulator of the p53 protein, raising the possibility that it might constitute an additional lung tumor suppressor gene at the 9p21 locus. To test the candidacy of p14ARF as a lung cancer suppressor and assess the role it plays in radiosensitivity, we transfected the wild-type p14ARF gene into four cell lines which had various endogenous gene backgrounds of INK4A-/p53+/RB+ (A549 and H460), INK4A+/p53+/RB- (H446) as well as p14ARF+/p53-/RB+ (Calu-1). We found that transfection of p14ARF is related to an obvious growth inhibition in all wtp53 cell lines, regardless of INK4A/ARF and RB status. Although it has been shown that p53-induced G1 checkpoint in response to DNA damage by ionizing radiation is p14ARF-independent, we found the radiosensitivity of two p14ARF-deficient cell lines was increased after p14ARF gene transfer. The results indicated that cell cycle redistribution after acquiring the exogenous gene might be the main explanation for the enhanced sensitization. An increased radiation-induced apoptotic proportion in one cell line also suggested a fortified p53 function that might be triggered by the restored p14ARF protein.",

However, the mechanisms on aberrant elevation of ARF in cancers are still poorly understood. We previously showed that ARF (p14ARF in human and p19Arf in mouse) elevation correlates with PTEN loss and stabilizes SLUG to reduce cell adhesion in prostate cancer (PCa). Here we report that ARF is essential for MMP7 expression, E-Cadherin decrease and the anchorage loss to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in PCa in vitro and in vivo. We found that Mmp7 is aberrantly elevated in cytosol and nucleus of malignant prostate tumors of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice. Interestingly, p19Arf deficiency strikingly decreases Mmp7 levels but increases E-Cadherin in Pten/Trp53/p19Arf mice. ARF knockdown markedly reduces MMP7 in human PCa cells. Conversely, tetracycline-inducible expression of ARF increases MMP7 with a decrease of E-Cadherin in PCa cells. Importantly, MMP7 physically binds ARF to show the co-localization in nucleus. Co-expression of MMP7 and ARF promotes cell migration, and MMP7 knockdown decreases wound healing in PCa cells. Furthermore, MMP7 elevation correlates with ARF expression in advanced human PCa. Our findings reveal for the first time that the crosstalk between ARF and MMP7 in nucleus contributes to ECM network in tumor microenvironments in vivo, implicating a novel therapeutic target for advanced PCa treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Eukaryotic cell division is regulated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI). Genes encoding these proteins are mutated or deleted in many types of cancer. For example, 20%-30% of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) have deletions in the CKI known as INK4a. The contribution of INK4a deletions to the progression of B-lineage ALL is uncertain, partially due to a paucity of data on expression in normal B-cell precursors. We therefore conducted a comparative analysis of normal and leukemic human B-cell development for the expression of cyclins, CDK, and CKI. Specific stages of human B-cell development from normal bone marrow were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The sorted populations and B-lineage ALL cell lines (BLIN-1, 2, 3, 4) were examined for expression of cyclins, CDK, and CKI by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting.RT-PCR analysis showed that cyclin D2, cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6 were ubiquitously expressed in normal B-cell development and in the BLIN ALL cell lines. The p19(INK4d) CKI was the most commonly expressed member of the INK4 family, whereas p16(INK4a) was more weakly and variably expressed. Expression of the p57(KIP2) CKI varied as a function of the stage of B-cell development. Analysis of normal B-cell precursors by Western blotting indicated that CDK4, CDK6, p19(INK4d), and p57(KIP2) were expressed, whereas p16(INK4a) was not detected. Cyclin D/CDK expression in normal and leukemic human B-cell precursors is similar to expression of these proteins in human and murine mature B cells. In contrast, the ubiquitous expression of p19(INK4d) has not been previously described in human or murine B-lineage cells. Our results suggest that loss of INK4a may only minimally contribute to tumor cell progression in B-lineage ALL, since expression of INK4d could provide a compensatory function as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.",

In a series of 11 microsatellite stable (MSS) and 9 microsatellite unstable (MSI) colon cancer cell lines and primary colon carcinomas (25 MSS and 28 MSI) with known ploidy stem line and APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutation status, we analyzed the promoter methylation of the following genes: hMLH1, MGMT, p16INK4a (CDKN2A alpha-transcript), p14ARF (CDKN2A beta-transcript), APC, and E-cadherin (CDH1). We compared the DNA methylation profiles of the cell lines with those of the primary tumors. Finally, we examined if the epigenetic changes were associated with known genetic markers and/or clinicopathological variables.;The cell lines and primary tumors generally showed similar overall distribution and frequencies of gene methylation. Among the cell lines, 15%, 50%, 75%, 65%, 20% and 15% showed promoter methylation for hMLH1, MGMT, p16INK4a, p14ARF, APC, and E-cadherin, respectively, whereas 21%, 40%, 32%, 38%, 32%, and 40% of the primary tumors were methylated for the same genes. hMLH1 and p14ARF were significantly more often methylated in MSI than in MSS primary tumors, whereas the remaining four genes showed similar methylation frequencies in the two groups. Methylation of p14ARF, which indirectly inactivates TP53, was seen more frequently in tumors with normal TP53 than in mutated samples, but the difference was not statistically significant. Methylation of p14ARF and p16INK4a was often present in the same primary tumors, but association to diploidy, MSI, right-sided location and female gender was only significant for p14ARF. E-cadherin was methylated in 14/34 tumors with altered APC further stimulating WNT signaling.;The present study shows that colon cancer cell lines are in general relevant in vitro models, comparable with the in vivo situation, as the cell lines display many of the same molecular alterations as do the primary carcinomas. The combined pattern of epigenetic and genetic aberrations in the primary carcinomas reveals associations between them as well as to clinicopathological variables, and may aid in the future molecular assisted classification of clinically distinct stages.",

The p14ARF, an alternative reading frame protein encoded from the same INK4a-ARF locus, is a potent tumour suppressor functionally linked to p53. There is little known regarding the role of p14ARF in primary human tumours. Therefore, we analysed the expression patterns of these two tumour suppressors in 37 cases of AML. The relative expression of p16INK4a and p14ARF mRNA in AML blasts, measured by a specific p16INK4a/p14ARF multiplex RT-PCR, was significantly shifted towards p14ARF whereas relatively lower levels of p16INK4a were detected. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed significantly higher expression of both transcripts in AML blasts when compared to normal differentiated myeloid cells or CD34+ progenitor cells. Furthermore, a good correlation between p16INK4a protein and mRNA was observed, whereas no correlation was found with p14ARF. Our results suggest: a) increased levels of both p16INK4a and p14ARF may participate in the pathogenesis of AML, b) that high p14ARF mRNA expression might influence p16INK4a transcription and c) that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are important for p14ARF expression.",

To determine whether p14(ARF) inactivation was involved in ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated carcinogenesis, the frequency and timing of p14(ARF) methylation was investigated in four different histological stages of UC-associated carcinogenesis. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing were used to determine the prevalence of p14(ARF) gene methylation. p14(ARF) methylation was observed in 19 of 38 (50%) adenocarcinomas, 4 of 12 (33%) dysplasias, and 3 of the 5 (60%) nonneoplastic UC mucosae. In contrast, 3 of 40 (3.7%) normal tissues showed p14(ARF) methylation (chi(2) test: P = 0.0003). Bisulfite sequencing was used to analyze 28 CpGs of p14(ARF) gene in 20 samples. The number of methylated CpGs ranged from 0 to 4, 0 to 20, and 0 to 28 in the normal, dysplastic, and carcinomatous samples, respectively (Kruskall-Wallis test: P = 0.0005). Densely methylated alleles were detected only in carcinomas by bisulfite sequencing. In conclusion, our data suggest that methylation of p14(ARF) is a relatively common early event in UC-associated carcinogenesis. p14(ARF) offers potential as a biomarker for the early detection of cancer or dysplasia in UC. Finally, analyses of p14(ARF) methylation in other organs should explore not only frank cancers but other premalignant lesions.",

Two of these cell cycle inhibitors, p16(INK4A) and p15(INK4B), have tumor suppressor activities and are inactivated in human cancer. Interestingly, both INK4 genes express alternative splicing variants. In addition to p16(INK4A), the INK4A locus encodes a splice variant, termed p12--specifically expressed in human pancreas--and ARF, a protein encoded by an alternative reading frame that acts as a tumor suppressor through the p53 pathway. Similarly, the human INK4B locus encodes the p15(INK4B) tumor suppressor and one alternatively spliced form, termed as p10. We show here that p10, which arises from the use of an alternative splice donor site within intron 1, is conserved in the mouse genome and is widely expressed in mouse tissues. Similarly to mouse p15(INK4B), p10 expression is also induced by oncogenic insults and transforming growth factor-beta treatment and acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. Importantly, we show that mouse p10 is able to induce cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner. We also show that mouse p10 is able to inhibit foci formation and anchorage-independent growth in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and that these antitransforming properties of mouse p10 are also p53-dependent.

Methylation of the APC-1A, p14(ARF), p16(INK4A), hMLH1, O(6)-MGMT, and RASSF1A promoters was studied using methylation-specific PCR in 122 sporadic CRCs, derived from patients with folate and alcohol intake at either the lower or the higher quintiles of the distribution.

This is particularly important in light of the increase of endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma and the decrease in incidence of squamous cell carcinoma. P16(INK4a) , a member of the INK4 family of cell cycle regulatory proteins, plays a critical role. It functions as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and differentiation by controlling the activity of the tumor-suppressor protein retinoblastoma (pRb), which regulates the cell cycle. Its expression is variable according to the tumoral histotype and in metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate P16(INK4a) expression in endocervical, endometrial, and metastatic ADCs of extra-uterine origin. Fifty gynaecological biopsies (cervix or endometrium) comprised the study for P16(INK4a) determination. Cases were classified as (1) diffuse positive (P), in intense nuclear immunostaining and/or cytoplasmic in > 30% of neoplastic cells; (2) focal positive (FP), in intense immunostaining in 10% to 30% in isolated cells or small groups; and (3) negative (N), in absence of immunostaining or weak, sporadic immunostaining in < 10% of neoplastic cells. Included in the study were the following: 6 endocervical ADCs, 11 endometrioid-type endometrial ADCs, 5 endometrial serous papillary ADCs, 7 ovarian ADCs, 4 large intestine ADCs, 1 breast ADC, 12 not-otherwise-specified (NOS) ADCs, and 4 endocervical biopsy without atypia (as control). Diffuse, strong positivity with P16(INK4a) suggests an endocervical rather than an endometrial or metastatic ADC. In fact, a P16(INK4a) positive immunostaining pattern was prevalent in endocervical (83%) and serous papillary ADCs of endometrial or ovarian origin, whereas endometrioid ADCs such as metastatic non-ovarian lesions generally presented only focal or negative immunostaining. 10/12 cases of ADC-NOS were reclassified using P16(INK4a) immunostaining: 2 as endocervical ADCs (2 P), 4 as endometrioid-type endometrial ADCs (2 FP, 2 N), 3 as endometrial serous papillary ADCs (3 FP), and 1 as ovarian serous papillary ADC (1 FP).",

DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of 93 astrocytic tumors was available for CDKN2A promoter methylation analysis and p16(INK4A) expression by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A strong negative correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining and CDKN2A promoter methylation was found. Additionally, a significant negative correlation between CDKN2A promoter methylation and age was observed; also, female patients had statistically more CDKN2A methylated promoters (p = 0.036) than men.

Here, we exploit a well-defined mouse model of RAS-induced melanomas to examine the impact of germline p16INK4a or p19ARF nullizygosity on melanoma formation. We demonstrate that loss of either Ink4a/Arf product can cooperate with RAS activation to produce clinically indistinguishable melanomas. In line with the common phenotypic end point, we further show that RAS+ p16INK4a-/- melanomas sustain somatic inactivation of p19ARF-p53 and, correspondingly, that RAS+ p19ARF-/- melanomas experience high-frequency loss of p16INK4a.

Strikingly, we also identify STAT3 and CDKN2A mutations in primary human PCa. STAT3 and CDKN2A deletions co-occurred with high frequency in PCa metastases.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of exons 1 and 2 of the gene showed no deletion or gross rearrangement in the p16 gene. The lack of deletion was further demonstrated by Southern blot analysis. Looking for point mutations, we used single-strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and, in half of the tumours, we sequenced both strands of exons 1 and 2. No mutations were detected.

A role for p16(INK4a) in basal cell carcinoma is suggested by the observation that p16(INK4a) was upregulated at the invasive front of the majority of basal cell carcinomas with infiltrative growth patterns, accompanied by cessation of proliferation. In this paper, we explore whether there is a difference of tumour cells' proliferative activity between the centre and the invasion front tissues of human colorectal cancer and its relationship with the expression and methylation status of p16(INK4a) gene. We obtained the centre and the invasion front tissues of colorectal cancer respectively by the technology of laser mircodissection. The expressions of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ki67 and p16(INK4a) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the different areas. There was a significant difference in the expressions of ki67 between the centre and the invasion front tissues (p < 0.05). The difference did not correlate with age, sex, Dukes stage but did correlate with expression of p16(INK4a) gene (chi(2) = 25.37, p < 0.01). Furthermore, hypermethylation of the promoter was the major mechanism of inactivation of p16(INK4a) in the centre areas. Demethylation of the p16(INK4a) promoter, the elevated expression of p16(INK4a) protein and mRNA level was proved in the invasion front. Our finding suggested that enhanced invasion in tumours was accompanied by ceased proliferation in the invasion fronts of human colorectal cancer. This interesting phenomenon may be due to not only the microenvironment, but also the molecular changes such as p16(INK4a) status.",

Fifty-seven colorectal carcinomas from a consecutive series were investigated. Using DNA from tissue homogenates, p16(INK4a) promoter methylation was seen in 17 of 57 tumors by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and this could be confirmed using DNA from laser-capture microdissected material in 16 of these cases. A total loss of immunohistochemical p16(INK4a) expression was seen in 6 of 17 tumors with promoter methylation. Quantification of immunohistochemical p16(INK4a) expression for the remaining 11 cases revealed statistically lower frequencies of expression as compared with cases without p16(INK4a) promoter methylation. 9p21 allelic loss was observed in 9 cases, but p16(INK4a) expression in these carcinomas was not reduced. Attempted linear regression of p16(INK4a) expression in tumor buds on the degree of tumor budding, as counted on pan-cytokeratin immunostains, did not show a correlation. p16(INK4a) promoter methylation can completely abrogate p16(INK4a) expression in colorectal carcinomas. In many cases, however, it has an appreciable but only modulatory influence on p16(INK4a) expression. Possibly, methylations are heterozygous, and/or mosaic in colorectal carcinomas and/or methylations are not totally stable but can be lost between carcinoma cell replication cycles. Up-regulation of p16(INK4a) does not seem to be a strict requirement for tumor budding, hence, the absence of a correlation.",

It is only rarely associated with Muir-Torre syndrome. Previous studies from Asian countries, have suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection plays a role in the pathogenesis and overexpression of p16(INK4a), a surrogate marker of HPV infection, have also been reported. However, data from western countries seem contradictory. In order to clarify and explore the molecular and epigenetic basis of HPV, CDKN2A status and role of microsatellite instability in the development of periocular sebaceous carcinoma, 24 cases of periocular sebaceous carcinoma were analyzed for the expression of p16(INK4a) and mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) via immunohistochemistry. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genechip HPV typing were used to detect HPV infection and decide its genotype when present. PCR amplification using a consensus primer pair was also performed to detect β-HPV. The methylation status of CDKN2A promoter region was studied by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. HPV-positivity was demonstrated in only one of our cases (HPV 16), while another case showed p16(INK4a) overexpression. All cases showed preserved expression of mismatch repair proteins. CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation was noted in nearly half of our cases (11/24) and was associated with younger patient age (P = .013). Our results showed that periocular sebaceous carcinoma is rarely associated with HPV and microsatellite instability. Higher frequency of CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation in younger patients implies a significant epigenetic role in tumor development in this age group. ",

In MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, expression of the tumor suppressor gene p14(ARF) fails to trigger apoptosis but induces an arrest in the G1 and, to a lesser extent, in the G2 phase in the cell division cycle. Here, inhibition of cell cycle arrest resulted in apoptosis induction in caspase-3 proficient MCF-7 cells upon expression of p14(ARF) . This occurred in the absence of S-phase progression or mitotic entry. In contrast, syngeneic, caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells remained entirely resistant to p14(ARF) -induced apoptosis. Thus, cell cycle checkpoint abrogation overcomes resistance to p14(ARF) -induced cell death and promotes cell death via a caspase-3-dependent pathway. Cell death coincided with dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and was inhibitable by pan-caspase inhibitors and the caspase-3/7 inhibitor zDEVD-fmk. Of note, mitochondrial events of apoptosis execution depended entirely on caspase-3 proficiency indicating that caspase-3 either acts \"up-stream\" of the mitochondria in a \"non-canonical\" pathway or mediates a mitochondrial feedback loop to amplify the apoptotic caspase signal in p14(ARF) -induced stress signaling.

Our goal was therefore to evaluate whether overexpression of p16(INK4a) is associated with HPV infection and to identify mechanisms of p16(INK4a) upregulation in UCIS.;In 60 tissue specimens from a total of 45 patients (UCIS and controls), we performed p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry followed by detection and subclassification of HPV DNA. In a subset of samples, we tested for gene amplification of p16(INK4a) applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RAS/MAPK signalling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Finally, we transfected urothelial carcinoma cells with KRAS and examined the expression of p16(INK4a) as well as markers of EMT.;We found overexpression of p16(INK4a) in 92.6% of UCIS and in all cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) controls. In contrast, we detected high-risk HPV DNA in 80% of CIN, but none in UCIS. There was no gene amplification of p16(INK4a). High levels of phosphorylated kinases and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and loss of membraneous E-cadherin were detected in UCIS. KRAS transfection of urothelial carcinoma cells led to upregulation of p16(INK4a) and uPA accompanied by loss of E-cadherin that could be inhibited by application of the kinase-inhibitor Sorafenib.;Our results show that overexpression of p16(INK4a) in UCIS is neither associated with HPV infection nor p16(INK4a) gene amplification but is a consequence of enhanced RAS/MAPK signalling that promotes EMT, possibly due to Sorafenib-sensitive paracrine secretion of the EMT activator uPA. These findings might open a novel therapeutic option for localized but aggressive urothelial cancer.",

Furthermore, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of wild-type p16INK4A is more toxic in cancer cells which express mutant forms of p16INK4A compared to cancer cell lines containing endogenous wild-type p16. TUNEL assay and DAPI staining following infection of MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells with Adp16 indicate that p16INK4A-mediated cytotoxicity was associated with apoptosis. This is supported by studies demonstrating a decrease in cpp32 and cyclinB1 protein levels and induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage following infection of MDA-MB-231 cells with Adp16.

        "Doc_abstract":"Morphologically normal foci of epithelial cells exhibiting p16 inactivation have been found in several tissues and may be precursors to cancer. Our previous work demonstrates that cells lacking p16(INK4A) activity exhibit phenotypes associated with malignancy (Romanov et al. 2001). The acquisition of genomic instability occurs through the activation of telomeric and centrosomal dysfunction. Additionally, the activation of stress pathways such as COX-2 provides these cells with the mutagenic potential to survive adverse environments as well as the ability to migrate, evade apoptosis and immune surveillance, and summon sustaining vasculature. Examination of archived tissue from women with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) reveals epithelial cells that overexpress markers of premalignant stress activation pathways and mirror the distinctive expression patterns of these markers observed in vitro. These epithelial cells are found within the premalignant lesion as well as in the field of morphologically normal tissue that surrounds the lesion. Here, we show that p16(INK4A)-silenced vHMEC cells exhibit a gene expression profile which is distinct, reproducible, and extends beyond the changes mediated by p16(INK4A) inactivation. The present work suggests that cells lacking p16(INK4A) activity exhibit critical activities which allow cells to evade differentiation processes that would be expected to terminate proliferation. All of these properties are critical to malignancy. These events may be useful biomarkers to detect the earliest events in breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Surgery, radiation, or hormone deprivation alone does not adequately affect local control of clinical or pathologic stage T3 prostate cancer. Lack of local cancer control ultimately leads to a higher incidence of morbidity, distant metastasis, and decreased survival, with patients having disease-specific mortality exceeding 75%. Other novel therapies against this devastating and common disease are needed for the achievement of long-term local cancer control. For this purpose, therapeutic interventions should target prostate-cancer cells at the molecular and cellular level in ways not possible by current modalities of cancer treatment. Any strategy that can modify the biologic behavior of these cells may potentially have the most significant clinical impact. As prostate cancer represents an accumulation of genetic mutations that causes a prostate cell to lose the ability to control its growth, one new approach against prostate cancer may be gene therapy. Identification of key missing or mutated tumor-suppressor genes that, when replaced, may inhibit or destroy prostate-cancer cells may have the best chance of clinical success. One such gene appears to be tumor-suppressor gene p16 (also known as MTS1, INK4A, and CDKN2). Tumor-suppressor gene p16 is an important negative cell-cycle regulator whose functional loss may significantly contribute to malignant transformation and progression. Alterations in the p16 gene and its protein expression often occur in prostate cancer. An adenoviral vector containing wild-type p16 (Adp16) had a high transduction efficiency in prostate-cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, prostate tumors injected with Adp16 expressed p16 and the adenoviral vector expressed the transgene for up to 14 days. Wild-type p16 inhibited prostate-cancer proliferation in vitro and markedly suppressed tumors in vivo. Pathologic evaluation of the Adp16-treated tumors showed dose-dependent necrosis and fibrosis. Although the mechanism of p16 inhibition in cancer remains to be elucidated, senescence and apoptosis may both be important; however, the data suggest that p16-induced growth inhibition can function independently of the retinoblastoma gene product.",

In vitro, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha have been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis induced by H. pylori. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in many cancers, including gastric cancer. Since p53 protein can induce apoptosis, we sought to determine whether or not p53 increases the ability of gastric epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis in response to H. pylori-induced cell injury. Human gastric epithelial cell lines, AGS (p53 wild-type) cells and AGS cells infected with HPV E6 gene (AGS-E6) to inactivate p53 were exposed to H. pylori. The p53, p21, and p14ARF proteins were measured in gastric epithelial cells by immunoelectrophoresis. Gastric epithelial cell apoptosis was measured by DNA end-labeling assay (TUNEL) and subG0 cell fractions using flow cytometry, and by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA. Exposure to H. pylori increased the levels of p53, p21, and p14ARF proteins two fold in AGS cells. Gastric AGS cells with fragmented DNA increased from 1.1% to 68% in after exposure to H. pylori for 24 hr. However, AGS-E6 cells were relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by H. pylori (only 15% of cells underwent apoptosis). In additional experiments, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were used to further investigate the role of ARF in stabilizing p53 after exposure to H. pylori. Wild-type and p19ARF-/- MEFs were exposed to H. pylori and evaluated for activation of p53, p19ARF, and apoptosis. As with AGS cells, H. pylori stimulated a 2-fold increase in p53 and p19ARF in wild-type MEFs; however, there was no increase in p53 in ARF-null MEFs. H. pylori easily stimulated apoptosis in wild-type MEFs, although, the absence of p19ARF significantly reduced the ability of H. pylori to induce apoptosis in these cells. Activation of ARF by H. pylori is important in stabilizing p53 resulting in increased apoptosis. Thus, inactivation of either ARF or p53 in gastric cells may reduce their ability to undergo apoptosis in response to injury induced by H. pylori.",

MRTs are extremely aggressive cancers caused by the loss of the hSNF5 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. We found previously that, in MRT cells, hSNF5 is required for p16(INK4a) induction, mitotic checkpoint activation, and cellular senescence. Here, we investigated how the balance between Polycomb group (PcG) silencing and SWI/SNF activation affects epigenetic control of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus in MRT cells. hSNF5 reexpression in MRT cells caused SWI/SNF recruitment and activation of p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a), but not of p14(ARF). Gene activation by hSNF5 is strictly dependent on the SWI/SNF motor subunit BRG1. SWI/SNF mediates eviction of the PRC1 and PRC2 PcG silencers and extensive chromatin reprogramming. Concomitant with PcG complex removal, the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein is recruited and active histone marks supplant repressive ones. Strikingly, loss of PcG complexes is accompanied by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B dissociation and reduced DNA methylation. Thus, various chromatin states can be modulated by SWI/SNF action. Collectively, these findings emphasize the close interconnectivity and dynamics of diverse chromatin modifications in cancer and gene control.",

RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DNMT1 protein expression resulted in >80% reduction of promoter methylation in RASSF1A, p16(ink4A), and CDH1 in NCI-H1299; and RASSF1A, p16(ink4A), and HPP1 in HCC1954; and re-expression of p16(ink4A), CDH1, RASSF1A, and SEMA3B in NCI-H1299; and p16(ink4A), RASSF1A, and HPP1 in HCC1954. By contrast, promoter methylation and lack of gene expression was maintained when these cell lines were treated with control small interfering RNAs. The small interfering RNA treatment was stopped and 17 days later, all of the sequences showed promoter methylation and gene expression was again dramatically down-regulated, indicating the tumor cells still were programmed for these epigenetic changes. We saw no effects on soft agar colony formation of H1299 cells 14 days after DNMT1 knockdown indicating that either these genes are not functioning as tumor suppressors under these conditions, or that more prolonged knockdown or other factors are also required to inhibit the malignant phenotype. These results provide direct evidence that loss of DNMT1 expression abrogates tumor-associated promoter methylation and the resultant silencing of multiple genes implicated in the pathogenesis of human lung and breast cancer.",

The nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 gene (Nrf2) is known to regulate the expression of detoxifying and antioxidant genes. We investigated the relationship between promoter polymorphisms of Nrf2 gene and the CpG island methylation in non-cancerous gastric mucosa. The study was performed in 85 subjects (46 without gastric malignancies, non-GC group, and 39 with gastric cancer, GC group). The promoter methylation status of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a) and p21(Waf1) genes was determined by methylation-specific-polymerase chain reaction. The Nrf2 gene genotypes were determined by the PCR-SSCP method. In the 85 subjects, CpG island methylation was found in 25.9% for p14, 15.3% for p16, none for p21. The frequency of the methylated genes was significantly higher in GC group than non-GC group (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.10-6.49; p=0.029). In particular, the frequency of p16 gene methylation was much higher in GC group (p=0.0023). The Nrf2 -686/-684 G/G haplotype was positively associated and A/G haplotype was inversely associated with the development of CpG island methylation, especially p14 gene methylation (OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.26-8.59; p=0.015, and OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15-0.96; p=0.040, respectively). In Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infected subjects, the number of -686/-684 G/G allele was positively correlated and that of A/G allele was inversely correlated to the methylation status, especially p14 methylation, by the adjusted analysis (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.14-7.36; p=0.026, and OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.88; p=0.027, respectively).

Whereas inactivation of p16INK4a has been described as a frequent event in lung cancer, the current function of p19ARF is still poorly understood. We have examined the expression of the human p19ARF (hp19ARF) protein in a large series of lung cancers using immunohistochemistry and showed that the protein was more frequently lost in high-grade neuroendocrine (NE) lung tumors (large cell NE carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma; 51 of 78, 65%) than it was in non-small cell lung cancer (25 of 101, 25%). No deleterious mutation was found in exons 1beta and 2 of hp19ARF in those NE tumors with negative immunoreactivity, and a beta transcript was detected in the majority of them. Concomitant absence of hp19ARF and retinoblastoma proteins was frequently detected in high-grade NE lung tumors, whereas no relationship could be found between the status of hp19ARF and p53 proteins in those tumors. These results are consistent with an alternative growth suppressor function for hp19ARF in NE lung cancer that is distinct from that of p16INK4a. Moreover, the frequent uncoupling between the beta transcript and the hp19ARF protein suggests a novel mechanism of inactivation at the translational level.",

In addition, statistical direct correlation in expression level of the three PcG members was detected. A correlation between c-Myc and Bmi-1 expression levels was observed; however, there was no correlation between expression of Bmi-1 and p16INK4a, p14ARF, or h-TERT.

In order to assess the frequency and the prognostic value of these abnormalities in NSCLC, immunohistochemical analysis of Rb, p16(INK4), and cyclin D1 has been performed on 168 cases of NSCLC including 77 squamous cell carcinomas, 43 adenocarcinomas, and 48 basaloid carcinomas. The reduced survival rate of basaloid carcinoma (stage I-II) compared with other histological types of NSCLC was confirmed (p = 0.008). Loss of protein expression of Rb and p16(INK4A) was observed in 12 per cent and 58 per cent of NSCLC cases respectively and cyclin D1 overexpression in 43 per cent. There was an inverse correlation between Rb and p16 expression ( p < 0.0001) and a direct correlation between Rb and cyclin D1 expression ( p = 0.0007). In univariate analysis, Rb-negative adenocarcinomas at stages I-II had a significantly shorter survival than Rb-positive cases ( p = 0.04) and stages I-II p16-positive cases had a shorter survival than p16-negative cases ( p = 0.02), which was more significant in basaloid carcinoma ( p = 0.003). p16 status retained its influence on survival in multivariate analysis at stage I-II for all cases ( p = 0.01) and for basaloid carcinoma ( p = 0.005). Cyclin D1 overexpression did not influence survival. Combined Rb/p16/cyclin D1 phenotypes in univariate analysis showed a shorter survival for Rb-negative/p16-positive/cyclin D1-negative tumours ( p = 0.002). These results, linked to previous data, indicate that the Rb pathway of G1 arrest is initially disrupted in the vast majority of NSCLCs (83 per cent), but could not confirm an unfavourable role for each individual event (p16(INK4A) loss or cyclin D1 up-regulation) in prognosis.",

We investigated bronchial aspirates of patients admitted for suspected lung cancer with regard to the prevalence of aberrant methylation of potential marker genes. Applying quantitative methylation specific PCR (QMSP) we analyzed bronchial aspirates from 75 patients with primary lung cancer and 64 bronchial aspirates of patients diagnosed with benign lung disease for promoter methylation of 3 candidate marker genes (p16(INK4a), RARB2 and SEMA3B). Hypermethylation of p16(INK4a) detected 18/75 (24%) cases with primary lung cancer and was present predominantly in squamous cell carcinomas (14/25; 56%). RARB2 QMSP at an assay threshold greater than 30 was found in 42/75 (56%) patients with lung cancer without relation to histological subtype. Patients with benign lung disease showed methylation of p16(INK4a) and a RARB2 QMSP at an assay threshold greater than 30 in 0/64 (0%) and 8/64 (13%) cases, respectively. Combining the 2 methylation markers, p16(INK4a) and RARB2, yielded a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 87% for the diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy. In contrast, SEMA3B displayed frequent promoter methylation (around 90%) both in bronchial aspirates of tumor and nontumor cases and thus was not suited as a biomarker. The results of this study indicate that QMSP analysis of p16(INK4a) and RARB2 may aid the diagnosis of primary lung cancer in bronchial aspirates. In particular, detection of p16(INK4a) methylation by QMSP may serve as a highly specific marker of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma.",

This activates the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and, through incompletely understood events, arrests the cell division cycle. To permit biochemical analysis of the arrest, we generated U2-OS osteogenic sarcoma cell clones in which p16 transcription could be induced. In these clones, binding of p16 to cdk4 and cdk6 abrogated binding of cyclin D1, p27(KIP1), and p21(WAF1/CIP1). Concomitantly, the total cellular level of p21 increased severalfold via a posttranscriptional mechanism. Most cyclin E-cdk2 complexes associated with p21 and became inactive, expression of cyclin A was curtailed, and DNA synthesis was strongly inhibited. Induction of p21 alone, in a sibling clone, to the level observed during p16 induction substantially reproduced these effects. Overexpression of either cyclin E or A prevented p16 from mediating arrest. We then extended these studies to HCT 116 colorectal carcinoma cells and a p21-null clone derived by homologous recombination. In the parental cells, p16 expression also augmented total cellular and cdk2-bound p21. Moreover, p16 strongly inhibited DNA synthesis in the parental cells but not in the p21-null derivative. These findings indicate that p21-mediated inhibition of cdk2 contributes to the cell cycle arrest imposed by p16 and is a potential point of cooperation between the p16/pRB and p14(ARF)/p53 tumor suppressor pathways.",

So how to identify patients at risk of progressive cervical lesions from those infected with HPV to avoid over treatment is a big issue in clinic. The aims of this study were to detect the expression of HPV L1 capsid protein and p16(INK4a) in cervical lesions and to investigate the combination expression of HPV L1 capsid protein and p16(INK4a) in cervical lesions and its diagnostic efficiency in clinic. Immunochemical method was used to detect the expression of HPV L1 capsid protein and p16(INK4a) in 169 cases of abnormal cytology. Histopathologic test was performed to identify cervical lesions of all the cases. chi(2) test and spearman's rank correlation were used for statistical analysis. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), accuracy, and the area under the receive operating characteristic (ROC) curve (denoted by A(Z)) were calculated with SPSS 13.0. All the statistical tests were two sided at the 5% level of significance. L1 expression decreased (P < 0.001), but p16(INK4a) expression increased (P < 0.001) with histopathologic diagnosis increasing. The expression rates of HPV L1 capsid protein, p16(INK4a), and L1(-)/p16(+) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2, CIN3, and squamous-cell carcinoma were statistically different from those in CIN1 (P < 0.001). The expressions of HPV L1 capsid protein, L1(+)/p16(+), L1(+)/p16(-), and L1(-)/p16(-) were negatively correlated with the severity of cervical lesions (P < 0.001), whereas the expressions of p16(INK4a) and L1(-)/p16(+) were positively correlated with the severity of cervical lesions (P < 0.001). The specificity and A(Z) of combining L1 with p16 (INK4a) were statistically higher than L1 or p16 (INK4a) alone (P < 0.05). L1 and p16(INK4a) are useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of cervical lesions.

Less toxic and more effective targeted therapies are urgently needed to treat this type of breast cancer. Here, we report that Broussoflavonol B, a chemical purified from the bark of the Paper Mulberry tree (Broussonetia papyrifera) exhibited potent growth inhibitory activity in ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells at sub-micromolar concentrations. Broussoflavonol B induced cell cycle arrest at both the G₀/G₁ and G₂/M phases accompanied by a downregulation of c-Myc protein, a upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitory proteins p16(INK4a), p19(INK4D) and p21(WAF1/CIP1) and a down-regulation of the expression levels of the G₂/M regulatory proteins such as cyclin B1, cdc2 and cdc25C. Broussoflavonol B also induced apoptotic cell death characterized by accumulation of the annexin V- and propidium iodide-positive cells, and cleavage of caspases 8, 9 and 3. In addition, Broussoflavonol B treatment also decreased the steady state levels of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ER-α36, a variant of estrogen receptor-α, and restricted growth of the stem-like cells in ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells.

In cancer patients, tumor suppressor p53 is frequently inactivated through mutations, whereas p16(INK4a) is silenced through promoter methylation. However, the interaction between these two pathways is less well understood. Here, we report that p53 controls p16(INK4a) expression in a unique way. p53 deficiency led to up-regulation of p16(INK4a) in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and various mouse organs, and an increase in the p16(INK4a) promoter activity, without affecting the half-life of p16(INK4a). Reconstitution of p53, but not mutant p53, restored the proper expression of p16(INK4a). These results indicate that p53 is necessary in repressing p16(INK4a) expression. However, up-regulation of p53 in response to genotoxic stress or nutlin-3 treatment did not down-regulate p16(INK4a). p53 did not repress the p16(INK4a) promoter activity either. These findings suggest that p53 has a necessary but not sufficient role in repressing p16(INK4a) expression. p16(INK4a) elevation in p53(-/-) cells is, at least partially, mediated by Ets1, a known positive regulator of p16(INK4a), as p53 deficiency up-regulated Ets1 through protein stabilization and knockdown of Ets1 down-regulated p16(INK4a) expression in p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These studies uncover a compensatory mechanism for the loss of p53 and provide a basis for targeting both p53 and p16(INK4a) in cancer therapy.",

The central role of the nervous system in the maintenance of vital activities and the functional consequences of the loss of neurons can explain how severe brain cancers are. The cell cycle is a highly complex process, with a wide number of regulatory proteins involved, and such proteins can suffer alterations that transform normal cells into malignant ones. The INK4 family members (CDK inhibitors) are the cell cycle regulators that block the progression of the cycle through the R point, causing an arrest in G1 stage. The p14ARF (alternative reading frame) gene is a tumor suppressor that inhibits p53 degradation during the progression of the cell cycle. The PTEN gene is related to the induction of growth suppression through cell cycle arrest, to apoptosis and to the inhibition of cell adhesion and migration. The purpose of the present study was to assess the mutational state of the genes p14ARF, p15INK4b, p16INK4a, and PTEN in 64 human nervous system tumor samples. Homozygous deletions were found in exon 2 of the p15INK4b gene and exon 3 of the p16INK4a gene in two schwannomas. Three samples showed a guanine deletion (63 codon) which led to a loss of heterozygosity in the p15 gene, and no alterations could be seen in the PTEN gene. Although the group of patients was heterogeneous, our results are in accordance with other different studies that indicate that homozygous deletion and loss of heterozygosity in the INK4 family members are frequently observed in nervous system tumors.",

We studied primary samples of 100 patients with lymphoid leukaemias [B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), n = 23; T-ALL, n = 7; B-cell chronic lymphocytic (B-CLL) or prolymphocytic (B-PLL) leukaemia, n = 50; T-CLL/T-PLL, n = 20] using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with eight overlapping cosmid clones covering the region on chromosome band 9p21 containing CDKN2. We did not observe any CDKN2 deletions in the 70 patients with chronic lymphoid leukaemias of B- or T-cell origin. Of the 23 patients with B-lineage ALL, one (4%) exhibited a CDKN2 deletion: in this patient, two clones were detected, one exhibiting a hemizygous and the other a homozygous deletion. On chromosome banding analysis, four patients with B-lineage ALL had a 9p aberration, whereas all CDKN2 copies were retained. In contrast, six of the seven (86%) patients with T-ALL exhibited CDKN2 deletions (homozygous, n = 4; hemizygous, n = 2). We conclude that hemizygous or homozygous deletions of the CDKN2 gene occur at high frequency in T-ALL and at low frequency in B-lineage ALL, supporting the role of this gene as a tumour suppressor, especially in T-ALL.

Alterations of its product have been observed in various malignancies, including non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We earlier investigated the mechanisms underlying p16(INK4A) inactivation. In the present study, we examined, in a series of 87 NSCLCs, its relationship with the kinetic parameters [proliferation index (PI) and apoptotic index (Al)] and the ploidy status of the tumors. In addition, we extended our previous LOH analysis of the 9p21-23 region by examining flanking areas of p16(INK4A). Aberrant p16 expression was observed in 41.4% of the carcinomas. A significant association was found with increased PI (p = 0.037), but not with apoptosis. Aneuploid tumors were more frequently correlated with abnormal p16 staining (p = 0. 05). A high frequency of allelic imbalance (Alm) was noticed at the D9S161 (51.3%) and D9S157 (64.5%) loci, which lie approximately 4cM centromeric and 7cM telomeric, respectively, to CDKN2A. Abnormal p16(INK4A) expression was strongly correlated with Alm at D9S161 (p = 0.004). Allelic losses at D9S157 occurred more frequently in early stages (p = 0.018) and were significantly associated with deletions at D9S161 (p = 0.035). We conclude that, in a sub-set of NSCLCs, (i) abnormal p16 expression contributes to tumor growth mainly by increasing the proliferative activity in the initial stages of carcinogenesis; (ii) the association with aneuploidy merely reflects the impact of aberrant p16 on proliferative activity; and (iii) other putative TSGs possibly reside within the 9p21-23 region that possibly co-operate in certain cases with CDKN2A in the development of NSCLCs.",

In contrast, despite the biochemical similarity to p16(INK4a), the frequency of defects in p15(INK4b) was found to be lower than in p16(INK4a), suggesting that p15(INK4b)-inductive agents may be useful for tumor suppression. Here we report the discovery of a novel pyrido-pyrimidine derivative, JTP-70902, which exhibits p15(INK4b)-inducing activity in p16(INK4a)-inactivated human colon cancer HT-29 cells. JTP-70902 also induced another CDK-inhibitor, p27(KIP1), and downregulated the expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1, resulting in G(1) cell cycle arrest. MEK1/2 was identified by compound-immobilized affinity chromatography as the molecular target of JTP-70902, and this was further confirmed by the inhibitory activity of JTP-70902 against MEK1/2 in kinase assays. JTP-70902 suppressed the growth of most colorectal and some other cancer cell lines in vitro, and showed antitumor activity in an HT-29 xenograft model. However, JTP-70902 did not inhibit the growth of COLO320 DM cells; in these, constitutive extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation was not detected, and neither p15(INK4b) nor p27(KIP1) induction was observed.

In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) the data concerning the mechanisms of p16INK4A inactivation suggest that point mutations and aberrant methylation of its promoter can only account for a proportion of the cases with abnormal p16 immunoexpression. The role of deletions in this procedure is not yet clarified. In order to gain more insight into the role of deletions in p16INK4A deregulated expression, we investigated the state of the chromosomal region 9p21-22 in a series of 57 NSCLCs, by performing a detailed mapping analysis, using a tight cluster of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, and correlating the findings with p16 immunostaining. Abnormal p16 expression was observed in 46% of the NSCLCs examined. No relationship was observed between p16 abnormal staining and various clinicopathological parameters. Abnormal p16 protein staining was strongly associated with hemizygous deletions at the IFNA and D9S171 microsatellite loci, which demarcate the region encoding the p16INK4A gene (P = 0.002). These findings suggest that deregulated expression of p16 is involved in the multistage process of NSCL carcinogenesis and that deletions may represent a predominant mechanism of p16INK4A inactivation. A significant percentage also of LOH was noticed at the D9S162 (35%) and D9S126 (38%) loci which lie 6cM and 4cM, respectively, far from the area which encodes p16INK4A, implying that other tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) may reside in this region. Although the overall incidence of LOH at the examined region was high (58%), we did not observe any correlation with smoking habits, histology and lymph node status. Another noteworthy finding was the existence of microsatellite instability (MI) in 11% of the patients. MI provides a marker for replication error phenotype (RER+), a recently defined manifestation of genetic instability observed in a wide range of tumors. In conclusion, alterations (LOH + MI) at the 9p21-22 chromosome region are frequent events in NSCLCs and may affect directly or indirectly the expression of p16.",

HR-HPV types encode two potent oncogenes, referred to as E6 and E7. Both are required to induce and maintain neoplastic growth of cervical cancer cells. Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor genes as for example p16INK4A were shown to be negative regulated by active pRb. Inactivation of pRb by E7 thus releases the p16 gene from its negative transcriptional control and results in significant overexpression of p16 encoded protein in HPV transformed cells. It has been demonstrated that p16 protein can be detected in cervical preneoplasia all high grade SIL or invasive cancers, whereas no expression was detected in normal, metaplastic or inflammatory cervical lesions. Moreover, low grade cervical lesions induced by low risk HPV infection but histological indistinguishable from low grade lesions induced by HR-HPV-infections could be clearly differentiated by p16INK4A immunohistochemistry, showing negative staining for p16 protein. The objective of this study is to examine the expression of p16 protein in cervical carcinoma in Thailand. Immunohistochemical analysis of p16INK4A was performed on 53 formalin fixed and paraffin embedded samples of various stages of cervical neoplastic lesions. There are squamous cell carcinoma in situ 8 cases, squamous cell carcinoma in situ with glandular involvement 16 cases, microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma 13 cases and invasive squamous cell carcinoma 16 cases. The specimens were taken from cervical biopsy, cervical conization and hysterectomy in the year 2000 at National Cancer Institute. Strong immunoreactivity for the p16 protein was observed in only the nuclei and cytoplasm of all cervical neoplastic cells. This study supported the idea that immunohistochemical overexpression of the p16 protein may be a useful screening test for cervical cancer. In addition, p16 immunohistochemistry is useful for helping in the interpretation of cervical histology samples, facilitating more rapid diagnosis.",

Therefore, we aimed to determine the role of Ras after p16(INK4a) re-expression. Here, we show that restitution of p16(INK4a) in pancreatic cancer cell lines elicits a profound suppression of K-Ras activity. A more detailed analysis in p16(INK4a) reconstituted Capan-1 cells indicated selective reduction of both K-Ras activity and protein stability. Re-expression of K-Ras in p16(INK4a) restituted Capan-1 cells reversed the anoikis-sensitive phenotype and increased colony formation, indicating that K-Ras suppression was required for p16(INK4a) -mediated reversion of the transformed phenotype. Inducible expression of p16(INK4a) in DanG cells confirmed inhibition of K-Ras activity as well as an increase in anoikis susceptibility.

These data suggest that cells that lack p16(INK4a) activity would be at high risk for breast cancer development and may exhibit an increased frequency of DNA methylation events in early cancer.;To test this hypothesis, the frequencies of INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation, as well as four additional selected loci, were tested in the initial random periareolar fine needle aspiration samples from 86 asymptomatic women at high risk for development of breast cancer, stratified using the Masood cytology index.;INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation was observed throughout all early stages of intraepithelial neoplasia and, importantly, in morphologically normal-appearing mammary epithelial cells; 29 of 86 subjects showed INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation in at least one breast. Importantly, INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation was not associated with atypia, and the frequency of hypermethylation did not increase with increasing Masood cytology score. The frequency of INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation was associated with the combined frequency of promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor-beta2, estrogen receptor-alpha, and breast cancer-associated 1 genes (P = 0.001).;Because INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation does not increase with age but increases with the frequency of other methylation events, we predict that INK4a/ARF promoter hypermethylation may serve as a marker of global methylation dysregulation.",

Deletion of p16(INK4a) in the T lineage ameliorated several aging phenotypes, including thymic involution, decreased production of naive T cells, reduction in homeostatic T-cell proliferation, and attenuation of antigen-specific immune responses. Increased T-cell neoplasia was not observed with somatic p16(INK4a) inactivation in T cells. In contrast, B lineage-specific ablation of p16(INK4a) was associated with a markedly increased incidence of systemic, high-grade B-cell neoplasms, which limited studies of the effects of somatic p16(INK4a) ablation on B-cell aging.

        "Doc_abstract":"ZBTB7A (Pokemon) is a member of the POK family of transcriptional repressors. Its main function is the suppression of the p14ARF tumour suppressor gene. Although ZBTB7A expression has been found to be increased in various types of lymphoma, there are no reports dealing with its expression in solid tumours. Given that p14(ARF) inhibits MDM2, the main negative regulator of p53, we hypothesized that overexpression of ZBTB7A could lead indirectly to p53 inactivation. To this end, we examined the status of ZBTB7A and its relationship with tumour kinetics (proliferation and apoptosis) and nodal members of the p53 network in a panel of 83 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We observed, in the majority of the samples, prominent expression of ZBTB7A in the cancerous areas compared to negligible presence in the adjacent normal tissue elements. Gene amplification (two- to five-fold) was found in 27.7% of the cases, denoting its significance as a mechanism driving ZBTB7A overproduction in NSCLCs. In the remaining non-amplified group of carcinomas, analysis of the mRNA and protein expression patterns suggested that deregulation at the transcriptional and post-translational level accounts for ZBTB7A overexpression. Proliferation was associated with ZBTB7A expression (p = 0.033) but not apoptosis. The association with proliferation was reflected in the positive correlation between ZBTB7A expression and tumour size (p = 0.018). The overexpression of ZBTB7A in both p53 mutant and p53 wild-type cases, implies either a synergistic effect or that ZBTB7A exerts its oncogenic properties independently of the p14(ARF)-MDM2-p53 axis. The concomitant expression of ZBTB7A with p14(ARF) (p = 0.039), instead of the anticipated inverse relation, supports the latter notion. In conclusion, regardless of the pathway followed, the distinct expression of ZBTB7A in cancerous areas and the association with proliferation and tumour size pinpoints a role for this novel cell cycle regulator in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.",

In this study, we examined the methylation status of these genes in 86 primary colorectal cancers using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and correlated the results with the clinicopathological features of the patients. Aberrant promoter methylation of p16 and p14 genes was detected in 43 of 86 (50%) and 25 of 86 (29%) colorectal cancers, respectively. Next, we examined the correlation of methylation status with the clinicopathological features.

On the other hand, there was no significant difference in other factors, such as the extent of tumor and Dukes stage. These results suggested that colorectal cancer with both p16 and p14 methylation has the same invasiveness at a smaller size compared to that of the cancer with neither p16 nor p14 methylation.

A series of 302 archival samples, including 150 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 152 CIN lesions, were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for p16(INK4A) and HPV testing using PCR with three primer sets (MY09/11, GP5/GP6, SPF). Follow-up data were available of 88 SCC patients, and 67 of the CIN lesions had been followed-up with serial PCR after conization. HR-HPV types were closely associated with CIN (OR 19.12; 95%CI 2.31-157.81) and SCC (OR 27.25; 95%CI 3.28-226.09). There was a significant linear relationship between the lesion grade and intensity of p16(INK4A) staining (p = 0.0001). The expression of p16(INK4A) was also closely related to HR-HPV (p = 0.0001). p16(INK4A) staining was a 100% specific indicator of CIN, with 100% PPV, and showed 83.5% sensitivity and 80.1% PPV in detecting HR-HPV. However, p16(INK4A) staining did not predict clearance/persistence of HR-HPV after treatment of CIN. Similarly, despite a slightly more favorable survival in women with strong/intense p16(INK4A) staining in univariate analysis, p16(INK4A) expression was not an independent prognostic predictor in multivariate survival (Cox) analysis. After adjustment for p16(INK4A) staining, HR-HPV, histological grade, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and age, only the last two were significant prognostic predictors (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively). The present data confirm the role of p16(INK4A) as a highly specific marker of CIN and HR-HPV type, but expression of this protein does not seem to be of any prognostic value in cervical cancer or in predicting the clearance of HR-HPV after treatment of CIN. We speculate that different subgroups of cervical cancer are characterized by aberrant p16(INK4A)/cyclin D/Rb pathways that are due to different mechanisms that can be mutually exclusive.",

Sixteen (30%) of the carcinomas were found to harbour high-risk HPV DNA, 15 of which contained HPV 16. HPV 16 E6/E7 oncogene transcripts were detected in 13 (87%) of the carcinomas that contained HPV 16.

This supports an active role for HPV E7 in interfering with the p16(INK4A)/cyclin D/Rb pathway.

Here, to evaluate the accuracy of p16(INK4a) expression for determining HPV infection and the prognostic value of HPV infection and p16(INK4a) expression for HNSCC survival, especially oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) survival, 150 fresh-frozen HNSCC samples were analyzed for HPV DNA, E6/E7 mRNA and p16(INK4a) expression by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. p16(INK4a) expression was scored from 0 to 4 according to the percentage of p16(INK4a)-positive cells, with overexpression defined as >40% positive cells. Of the 150 tumor samples tested, 10 tumors were nasopharyngeal, 53 oropharyngeal, 39 hypopharyngeal, 24 laryngeal and 24 were located in the oral cavity. HPV DNA was detected in 47 (31.3%) samples, but only 21 also exhibited HPV mRNA expression. Inter-rater agreement was low between p16(INK4a) expression and HPV DNA presence and between p16(INK4a) expression and HPV mRNA expression, but was good between the combination of HPV DNA status and p16(INK4a) overexpression and HPV mRNA expression. Three-year recurrence-free survival was significantly higher for OPSCC patients who were HPV DNA-positive than for OPSCC patients who were HPV DNA-negative (P=0.008) and for OPSCC patients overexpressing p16(INK4a) than for without overexpressing p16(INK4a) (P=0.034). Multivariate analysis revealed that T1-3 stage and the combination of HPV DNA positivity and p16(INK4a) overexpression predicted significantly better recurrence-free survival. This combination is a more accurate marker for active HPV infection in HNSCC than HPV DNA status or general p16(INK4a)-positive status alone and offers a useful and reliable method for detecting and determining the prognosis of HPV-related HNSCC.",

However, the role of ANRIL in cancer cell proliferation is less well understood.

Silencing ANRIL by both transfection with small interfering RNA and retrovirally produced small hairpin RNA reduced HCT116 cell proliferation in both two- and three-dimensional culture. HCT116 cells depleted for ANRIL were arrested in the S phase of cell cycle. Notably, silencing ANRIL did not result in the activation of expression of the INK4 locus.

The functions of p14(ARF) are closely linked with its subcellular distribution. Nucleolar p14(ARF) dampens ribosome biosynthesis and nucleoplasmic forms of p14(ARF) activate the p53 pathway and induce cell cycle arrest. p14(ARF) can also be recruited to mitochondria where it interacts with many mitochondrial proteins, including Bcl-x(L) and p32 to induce cell death. It has been suggested that the movement of p14(ARF) to mitochondria requires its interaction with p32, but we now show that the ARF-p32 interaction is not necessary for the accumulation of p14(ARF) in mitochondria. Instead, highly hydrophobic domains within the amino-terminal half of p14(ARF) act as mitochondrial import sequences. We suggest that once this hydrophobic pocket is exposed, possibly in a stimulus-dependent manner, it accelerates the mitochondrial import of p14(ARF). This allows the interaction of p14(ARF) with mitochondrial proteins, including p32 and enables p53-independent cell death.",

To determine if alterations in the coding regions of the p18 and p19 genes, which are novel members of the INK4 family and if they correlate with the development of human cancer, 100 human cancer cell lines were analyzed. Two other INK4 gene family members, p15INK4b/MTS2 and p16INK4/MTS1 genes were also analyzed. Homozygous deletions of the p15INK4b/MTS2 gene were detected in 29 cancer cell lines. Thirty-five homozygous deletions and 7 intragenic mutations of the pl6INK4/MTS1 gene were also detected in these cell lines. Neither homozygous deletions nor intragenic mutations of the p18 and p19 genes were found except in an ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3, harboring a single base pair deletion in exon 1 of p19. In p16INK4/MTS1 expression analysis, 5 cell lines with both authentic and alternative spliced p16INK4/MTS1 mRNA had no detectable p16INK4/MTS1 protein. These results suggest the hypotheses that either post-translational modification or enhanced degradation may be responsible for the lack of detection of the p16INK4/MTS1 protein. Using Western blot analysis, subsets of 26 human cancer cell lines were examined for p18 expression and 39 cell lines for p19 expression. All of these cell lines expressed the p18 or p19 protein, with the exception of SKOV3, which did not express p19. Therefore, the INK4 gene family may be divided into 2 groups. One group includes p15INK4b/MTS2 and p16INK4/MTS1, in which genetic and epigenetic alterations might contribute to the development of human cancers. The other group includes p18 and p19, in which somatic mutations are uncommon in many types of human cancer, and their role in human carcinogenesis and cancer progression is uncertain.",

Here we provide an overview of the functional interactions of B23 and ARF. We also integrate the current models into a unified picture, showing that B23 is essential for stabilizing and maintaining a basal level of ARF in the nucleolus, whereas increasing levels of ARF after oncogenic stress promotes B23 degradation and interferes with B23 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In this way, ARF can be regarded as a parasitic peptide on the B23 molecule, because ARF uses this chaperone for its own survival but also antagonizes normal activities of B23. Finally, the functional significance of the ARF-B23 interaction for tumor development and the prospects for novel cancer therapies are evaluated.",

As a member of PcG proteins, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) targets cell cycle regulatory proteins which govern cell cycle progression and cellular senescence. In previous work, we reported that EZH2 depletion functionally induced cellular senescence in human gastric cancer cells with mutant p53. However, whether EZH2 expression contributes to the change of key cell cycle regulators and the mechanism involved are still unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of EZH2 depletion on alteration of histone methylation pattern. In gastric cancer cells, INK4/ARF locus was activated to certain extent in consequence of a decrease of H3K27me3 along it caused by EZH2 silence, which contributed substantially to an increase in the expression of p15(INK4b), p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) and resulted in cellular senescence ultimately. Furthermore, MKN28 cells, which did not express p16(INK4a) and p21(cip), could be induced to senescence via p15(INK4b) activation and suppression of p15(INK4b) reversed senescence progression induced by EZH2 downregulated. These data unravel a crucial role of EZH2 in the regulation of INK4/ARF expression and senescence procedure in gastric cancer cells, and show that the cellular senescence could just depend on the activation of p15(INK4b)/Rb pathway, suggesting the cell-type and species specificity involved in the mechanisms of senescence inducement.

Inactivation of the related p15(INK4b) gene has also been identified in a number of tumors and cell lines, however, its role as an independent tumor suppressor remains to be elucidated. Chemically-induced tumors in the Syrian Golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) have been shown to be excellent representative models for the comparative development and progression of a number of human malignancies. The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of the p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes in two experimental hamster models for human pancreatic and oral carcinogenesis. First, hamster p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. The hamster p16(INK4a) cDNA open reading frame (ORF) shares 78%, 80%, and 81% identity with the human, mouse, and rat p16(INK4a) sequences, respectively. Similarly, the hamster p15(INK4b) cDNA ORF shares 82% and 89% sequence identity with human and mouse p15(INK4b), respectively. Second, a deletion analysis of hamster p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes was performed for several tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic hamster cell lines and revealed that both p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) were homozygously deleted in a cheek pouch carcinoma cell line (HCPC) and two pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (KL5B, H2T), but not in tissue matched, non-tumorigenic cheek pouch (POT2) or pancreatic (KL5N) cell lines. These data strongly suggest that homozygous deletion of the p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes plays a prominent role in hamster pancreatic and oral tumorigenesis, as has been well established in correlative studies in comparable human tumors. Furthermore, this study supports the comparative importance of the hamster pancreatic and cheek pouch models of carcinogenesis in subsequent mechanistic-, therapeutic-, and preventive-based studies aimed at providing important translational data applicable to pancreatic adenocarcinoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma in humans.",

The positive rates of p16 protein and mRNA in breast cancer were 28/60 and 39/60 respectively.;The results demonstrate that several kinds of p16 gene structural changes exist in breast cancer. The structural changes of p16 gene cause abnormal p16 expression, the main mechanisms are hypermethylation, while HZD or mutation are the secondary causes. Abnormal expression of p16 gene then becomes involved in the development and metastasis of breast cancer.",

Although the contribution of p16INK4a to human tumorigenesis through point mutation, deletion, and hypermethylation has been widely documented, little is known about specific p14ARF lesions and their consequences. Recent data indicate that p14ARF suffers inactivation by promoter hypermethylation in colorectal cancer cells. Because it is known that p14ARF prevents MDM2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and thus stabilizes p53 by attenuating MDM2-mediated degradation, we studied the relationship of p14ARF epigenetic silencing to the expression and localization of MDM2 and p53. Cancer cell lines with an unmethylated p14ARF promoter showed strong nuclear expression of MDM2, whereas in a colorectal cell line with p14ARF hypermethylation-associated inactivation, MDM2 protein was also seen in the cytosol. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was able to reinternalize MDM2 to the nucleus, and p53 expression was restored. No apparent changes in retinoblastoma localization were observed. We also studied the profile of p14ARF promoter hypermethylation in an extensive collection of 559 human primary tumors of different cell types, observing that in colorectal, gastric, renal, esophageal, and endometrial neoplasms and gliomas, aberrant methylation of p14ARF was a relatively common epigenetic event. MDM2 expression patterns revealed that lack of p14ARF promoter hypermethylation was associated with tumors showing exclusive nuclear MDM2 staining, whereas MDM2 cytosolic staining was frequently observed in neoplasms with aberrant p14ARF methylation. Taken together, these data support that epigenetic silencing of p14ARF by promoter hypermethylation is a key mechanism in the disturbance of the MDM2 nuclear localization in human cancer.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI) and promoter methylation of CRC-associated genes. Therefore, 71 CRCs were analysed for CIN and MSI by comparative genomic hybridization and the mononucleotide marker BAT-26, respectively. Promoter methylation of the tumour suppressor and DNA repair genes hMLH1, O(6)-MGMT, APC, p14(ARF), p16(INK4A), RASSF1A, GATA-4, GATA-5 and CHFR was analysed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These integrative analyses showed that in CIN+ CRCs, promoter methylation of GATA-4 and p16(INK4A) was inversely related to chromosomal loss at 15q11-q21 and gain at 20q13, respectively (P values: 3.8 x 10(-2) and 4.5 x 10(-2), respectively). Interestingly, promoter methylation of RASSF1A, GATA-4, GATA-5 and CHFR, as well as a high methylation index (MI), was positively related to chromosomal gain at 8q23-qter (P values: 1.5 x 10(-2), 3.8 x 10(-2), 3.9 x 10(-2), 4.9 x 10(-2) and 8.2 x 10(-3), respectively). MSI was associated with BRAF mutation, promoter methylation of hMLH1, APC and p16(INK4A) and a high MI (total number of methylated genes) (P values: 2.4 x 10(-2), 2.5 x 10(-3), 1.8 x 10(-2), 4.6 x 10(-2) and 1.0 x 10(-2), respectively).

Senescence can be overcome if the pathway is not fully engaged, and this may occur when p16(INK4a) is inactivated. p16(INK4a) is frequently altered in human cancer and germline mutations affecting p16(INK4a) have been linked to melanoma susceptibility. To characterize the functions of melanoma-associated p16(INK4a) mutations, in terms of promoting proliferative arrest and initiating senescence, we utilized an inducible expression system in a melanoma cell model. We show that wild-type p16(INK4a) promotes rapid cell cycle arrest that leads to a senescence programme characterized by the appearance of chromatin foci, activation of acidic beta-galactosidase activity, p53 independence and Rb dependence. Accumulation of wild-type p16(INK4a) also promoted cell enlargement and extensive vacuolization independent of Rb status. In contrast, the highly penetrant p16(INK4a) variants, R24P and A36P failed to arrest cell proliferation and did not initiate senescence. We also show that overexpression of CDK4, or its homologue CDK6, but not the downstream kinase, CDK2, inhibited the ability of wild-type p16(INK4a) to promote cell cycle arrest and senescence. Our data provide the first evidence that p16(INK4a) can initiate a CDK4/6-dependent autonomous senescence programme that is disabled by inherited melanoma-associated mutations.",

Against this background, we aimed to assess HPV types and HPV DNA load in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) of 95 patients treated with standard CRT for anal cancer to correlate viral load (≤/> median) with local failure, distant metastases, cancer-specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS) rates. Various clinicopathologic parameters and the immunohistochemical marker p16(INK4a) were evaluated for any correlation with HPV16 DNA load and were included in uni- and multivariate analyses. The overall prevalence of HPV DNA was 95.8% with HPV16 monoinfection being the most commonly encountered HPV type (78.9%), followed by HPV16 and 31, 35, 39, 44, 58, 66 and 81 dual infection in 9 patients (9.5%). HPV16 DNA load was significantly associated with p16(INK4a) expression (p = 0.001). Patients with HPV16 DNA load ≤ median and low p16(INK4a) expression showed significantly worse local control (HPV16 DNA load: univariate p = 0.023, multivariate p = 0.042; p16(INK4a): univariate p = 0.021), and OS (HPV16 DNA load: univariate p = 0.02, multivariate p = 0.03). Moreover, a combined HPV16 DNA load and p16(INK4a) variable revealed a significant correlation to decreased local failure, and increased CSS and OS (p = 0.019, p = 0.04 and p = 0.031). In conclusion, these data indicate that HPV16 DNA load and p16(INK4a) expression are significant prognostic factors for local tumor control and overall survival of patients with anal SCC following CRT.",

Lymphocyte DNA from consecutive, unselected white non-Hispanic patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma was used to sequence CDKN2A. Frequencies of mutations that alter the coding of p16INK4 or p14ARF were quantified overall and in subgroups. Penetrance and likelihood of carrying mutations by family history were estimated. Among 1537 cases, 9 (0.6%) carried germline mutations in CDKN2A, including three previously unreported mutations. CDKN2A mutation carriers were more likely to have a family history of pancreatic cancer (P=0.003) or melanoma (P=0.03), and a personal history of melanoma (P=0.01). Among cases who reported having a first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer or melanoma, the carrier proportions were 3.3 and 5.3%, respectively. Penetrance for mutation carriers by age 80 was calculated to be 58% for pancreatic cancer (95% confidence interval (CI) 8-86%), and 39% for melanoma (95% CI 0-80). Among cases who ever smoked cigarettes, the risk for pancreatic cancer was higher for carriers compared with non-carriers (HR 25.8, P=2.1 × 10⁻¹³), but among nonsmokers, this comparison did not reach statistical significance. Germline mutations in CDKN2A among unselected pancreatic cancer patients are uncommon, although notably penetrant, especially among smokers. Carriers of germline mutations of CDKN2A should be counseled to avoid tobacco use to decrease risk of pancreatic cancer in addition to taking measures to decrease melanoma risk.",

By contrast, DNA studies showed a much lower frequency of loss of the CDKN2A gene. Point mutations and promoter methylation of CDKN2A were seen in 7% and 23%, respectively, of primary tumors. Loss of heterozygosity analysis using a dense set of 9p markers showed allelic imbalance that included CDKN2A in only 31% of samples, but a further 47% showed loss at loci near CDKN2A with apparent retention of CDKN2A. No tumor with any allelic imbalance expressed CDKN2A, whether or not the imbalance appeared to involve the CDKN2A locus. We interpret these data as showing partially overlapping deletions on the two 9p homologues, with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A masked by amplification of contaminating stromal material. Our data show that inactivation of the CDKN2A gene products is a near-universal step in the development of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and we suggest that homozygous deletion is the most common mechanism of inactivation. The CDKN2A locus may be particularly prone to deletion because it encodes two unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, CDKN2A (p16INK4a) and p19ARF, and deletion, but not point mutation or methylation, would inactivate both gene products. However, our results also suggest that complex patterns of allelic imbalance in primary squamous carcinomas in general may not provide reliable evidence for the existence of multiple tumor suppressor genes within a single chromosomal region.",

A high proportion of p16-positive tumour cells was associated with advanced stage and grade, and with poor prognosis in cancer patients. For FIGO stage I tumours, a high proportion of p16-positive tumour cells was associated with poorer survival, suggesting that accumulation of p16 is an early event of ovarian tumorigenesis. In contrast to tumour cells, high expression of p16 in the surrounding stromal cells was not associated with the stage and grade, but was associated with longer survival. When all parameters were combined in a multivariate analysis, high p16 expression in stromal cells was not an independent predictor for survival, indicating that low p16 expression in stromal cells is associated with other markers of tumour progression.

        "Doc_abstract":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most tightly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumour. The EBV oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is frequently expressed in NPC tumours and may play a role in the genesis of the disease. NPC tumours often exhibit loss of expression (by deletion or methylation) of the INK4a locus, which encodes the tumour suppressor genes p16INK4a and p14ARF. To investigate the contribution of LMP1 and INK4a loss to tumourigenesis, skin chemical carcinogenesis was conducted using PyLMP1 and INK4a null mice. Surprisingly, INK4a null mice developed significantly fewer papillomas than wild-type mice, nevertheless, the papillomas that did develop grew faster and converted more rapidly to carcinoma than controls. This indicates that while loss of the INK4a locus plays an important role in the later stages of tumourigenesis, initially its loss inhibits papilloma formation. Conversely, LMP1 promoted papilloma formation but paradoxically inhibited papilloma growth. Using cross-breeds, it was found that LMP1 cooperates with loss of the INK4a locus during epithelial tumourigenesis. The expression of LMP1 overcame the inhibition of papilloma formation observed in INK4a null mice, whilst the loss of the INK4a locus counteracted the inhibition of papilloma growth rate found in PyLMP1 mice. This suggests that LMP1 mediates the inhibition of papilloma growth via one or both of the INK4a locus products. Intriguingly, mice heterozygous for INK4a loss showed lesion growth rates intermediate between wild-type and null, demonstrative of haploinsufficiency. We propose that LMP1 acts at the early stages in carcinogenesis to promote the development of benign tumours and that early reduction of INK4a locus expression allows these lesions to expand in size. In addition, loss of the INK4a locus accelerates the development of a more aggressive lesion. Conversely, complete loss of the INK4a locus in an otherwise normal cell might inhibit lesion formation.",

Because degree of tumor malignancy directly correlates with the expression of VEGF but inversely correlates with the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16, we examined whether restoration of p16 in breast cancer cells that lack p16 expression would modulate VEGF expression, and if so, how are the effects of p16 expression on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. To facilitate induction of p16 expression, a recombinant adenovirus expressing p16 (AdRSVp16) was used to transduce breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and JygMC(A).

Re-expression of Bax in these cells failed to further enhance p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis, suggesting that p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis primarily depends on Bak but not Bax in these cells. To further define the role of Bak and Bax in p14(ARF)-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, we employed short interference RNA for the knockdown of bak in isogeneic, p53 wild-type HCT116 colon cancer cells either proficient or deficient for Bax. There, combined loss of Bax and Bak attenuated p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis whereas single loss of Bax or Bak was only marginally effective, as in the case of DU145. Notably, HCT116 cells deficient for Bax and Bak failed to release cytochrome c and showed attenuated activation of caspase-9 (LEHDase) and caspase-3/caspase-7 (DEVDase) upon p14(ARF) expression. These data indicate that p14(ARF) triggers apoptosis via a Bax/Bak-dependent pathway in p53-proficient HCT116, whereas Bax is dispensable in p53-deficient DU145 cells. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of p14(ARF)-induced cell death proceeds in a Bax/Bak-independent manner. This is also the case for inhibition of clonogenic growth that occurs, at least in part, through an entirely Bax/Bak-independent mechanism.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The INK4a and ARF genes found at the CDKN2A locus are key effectors of cellular senescence that is believed to act as a powerful anticancer mechanism. Accordingly, mutations in these genes are present in a wide variety of spontaneous human cancers and CDKN2A germ line mutations are found in familial melanoma. The TBX2 gene encoding a key developmental transcription factor is amplified in pancreatic cancer cell lines and preferentially amplified and overexpressed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated breast tumors. Overexpression of Tbx2 and the related factor Tbx3, which is also overexpressed in breast cancer and melanomas, can suppress senescence in defined experimental systems through repression of ARF expression. However, it is not known how Tbx2 mediates its repressive effect nor whether endogenous Tbx2 or Tbx3 perform a similar antisenescence function in transformed cells. This is a particularly important question because the loss of CDKN2A in many human cancers would, in principle, bypass the requirement for Tbx2/3-mediated repression of ARF in suppressing senescence. We show here that Tbx2 is overexpressed in melanoma cell lines and that Tbx2 targets histone deacetylase 1 to the p21Cip1 (CDKN1A) initiator. Strikingly, expression of an inducible dominant-negative Tbx2 (dnTbx2) leads to displacement of histone deacetylase 1, up-regulation of p21(Cip1) expression, and the induction of replicative senescence in CDKN2A-null B16 melanoma cells. In human melanoma cells, expression of dnTbx2 leads to severely reduced growth and induction of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. The results suggest that the activity of endogenous Tbx2 is critically required to maintain proliferation and suppress senescence in melanomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Understanding the interaction of Arf and Hdm2 has recently become a central issue in cancer biology. In response to hyperproliferative signals, p14(Arf) stabilizes p53 by binding to Hdm2 and inhibits the ubiquitination and subsequent proteosome-dependent degradation of p53. The medical importance of the Arf-Hdm2-p53 regulatory system is highlighted by the finding that either p53 or p14(Arf) are lost or modified in virtually all human cancers. Isolated Arf and Hdm2 domains are dynamically disordered in solution, yet they retain the ability to interact in vitro and in cellular assays. Upon binding, domains of both Arf and Hdm2 undergo a dramatic transition from disordered conformations to extended structures comprised of beta-strands. The presence of domains from both proteins are necessary and sufficient for the formation of the highly stable extended beta structures. We have mapped sites within Arf and Hdm2 that interact at a resolution of five amino acid residues using surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry confirm the presence of multiple interaction domains within each protein. Both p14(Arf) (human) and p19(Arf) (mouse) interact with Hdm2 through two short motifs present in their N termini. The Arf interacting region of Hdm2 is also composed of two short sequences located in the central acidic domain, between residues 235-264 and 270-289. The binding-induced structural transition is also induced by short peptides, 15 amino acids in length, that contain the binding motifs. Micro-injection and live cell imaging of proteins tagged with fluorescent labels was used to confirm the in vivo function of the interaction domains. Arf and Hdm2 thus appear to interact through a novel mechanism that exerts control over the cell division cycle. The novel molecular mechanism of interaction and the limited size of the protein domains involved provide opportunities for the development of anticancer therapeutics.",

A variety of factors have been reported to play a role in this latter process. We report here that p14(ARF) displays different effects on the anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of p53-null/Mdm2 wild type cells. p14(ARF) blocks both the anchorage-dependent and-independent (soft agar) proliferation of 293T and p53(-/-) HCT116, but not p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells. While p14(ARF) had no effect on the anchorage-dependent proliferation of p53(-/-) MEFs and Ras12V-transformed p53(-/-) MEFs, it inhibited the growth of Ras12V-transformed p53(-/-) MEFs in soft agar. Furthermore, ectopic expression of p14(ARF) did not lead to degradation of the E2F1 protein and did not result in the reduction of E2F1 activity detected by two E2F1 responsible promoters, Apaf1 and p14(ARF) promoter, in 293T, p53(-/-) HCT116, and H1299 cells. This is consistent with our observations that p14(ARF) did not result in G1 arrest, but induced apoptosis via Bax up-regulation.

Although surgery offers the best chance for survival, it is not appropriate for all cases. The only adjuvant treatment to show promise is chemotherapy. Hence new treatments are urgently sought. We previously reported that adenoviral (Ad)-mediated delivery of p53 (Adp53) and p16(INK4A) (Adp16) significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines and established subcutaneous pancreatic tumours in nude mice (Ghaneh P, et al. Adenovirus mediated transfer of p53 and p16INK4A results in pancreatic cancer regression in vitro and in vivo. Gene Ther 2001; 8: 199-208). In this study we examine whether combining Ad-mediated delivery of p53 or p16(INK4A) with clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drugs has therapeutic potential for pancreatic cancer.;Four pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were evaluated for their sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine and two of these, Suit-2 and Panc-1, were chosen for combination experiments because they showed moderate and poor sensitivity, respectively, to 5-FU and gemcitabine. We found no evidence for enhanced cytotoxicity when either cell line was transduced with Adp53 before or after incubation with chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast, incubation of Panc-1 cells with either 5-FU or gemcitabine followed by Ad-mediated overexpression of p16(INK4A) resulted in a substantial reduction in cell viability under conditions where the drugs alone had minimal cytotoxicity. Incubation of Suit-2 cells with 5-FU followed by Ad-mediated overexpression of p16(INK4A) also resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability. This, however, was observed only with higher concentrations of 5-FU and viral vector. Cell cycle analysis of Panc-1 cells showed that the combination of cytotoxic drugs and Adp16 resulted in an increase in the sub-G1 population suggesting an increase in apoptosis. Dual labelling of these cells with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) confirmed that the combination of 5-FU and Adp16 resulted in a significant increase in early apoptotic cells (annexin V positive and PI negative) compared with controls. Moreover, overexpression of p16(INK4A) was associated with a reduction in pRb levels in these cells-high levels of pRb have been proposed to contribute to chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells.;We have shown that the currently used chemotherapeutic drugs for pancreatic adenocarcinoma combined with restoration of p16(INK4A) expression hold promise for the adjuvant treatment of this disease.

Tissue microarrays (TMA) of 124 SCC were created, immunostained, and analyzed following whole slide digitalization using the Pannoramic Scan and the TMA Module software (3DHISTECH Kft, Budapest, Hungary). Statistical analysis of scoring results was carried out using Pearson's chi-square test. We observed the significant elevation of p16(ink4) and Ki67 expression in supraglottic, tonsillar and tonsillo-lingual SCCs compared to those affecting the oral cavity, oropharynx without tonsils, larynx without supraglottis and the hypopharynx. This differential antigen expression may reflect the diverse route of embryologic differentiation followed by the affected regions except those of the tonsils and the supraglottis which show similar antigenic pattern but diverse developmental path. All the other biomarkers tested including p53, collagen XVII and EGFR were detected in the majority of cancers including high grade cases, but did not reveal any significant regional difference. Based on our results oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas may not be regarded as one entity. Concerning the oral cavity and the oropharynx, cancers affecting the tonsils (palatine and lingual) show significantly elevated p16(ink4) and Ki67 expression; so as the cancers of the supraglottis compared to the rest of larynx. Consequently, tonsillar and supraglottic cancers show similar biomarker profiles. Correlation of differential biomarker expression with diverse biological behavior in head and neck cancers need further investigations.",

A few case reports of oral squamous cell carcinomas arising from regions of phenytoin induced gingival overgrowth (GO), and overexpression of mitogenic factors and p53 have presented this condition as a pathology with potential to transform into malignancy. We recently investigated the genetic status of p53 and H-ras, which are known to be frequently mutated in Indian oral carcinomas in GO tissues and found them to only contain wild type sequences, which suggested a non-neoplastic nature of phenytoin induced GO. However, besides p53 and H-ras, other oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as PIK3CA, p14ARF, p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1, are frequently altered in oral squamous cell carcinoma, and hence are required to be analyzed in phenytoin induced GO tissues to be affirmative of its non-neoplastic nature.;100ng of chromosomal DNA isolated from twenty gingival overgrowth tissues were amplified with primers for exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA, exons 1α, 1β and 2 of p16INK4a and p14ARF, and exon 2 of p21Waf1/Cip1, in independent reactions. PCR amplicons were subsequently gel purified and eluted products were sequenced.;Sequencing analysis of the twenty samples of phenytoin induced gingival growth showed no mutations in the analyzed exons of PIK3CA, p14ARF, p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1.;The present data indicate that the mutational alterations of genes, PIK3CA, p14ARF, p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 that are frequently mutated in oral squamous cell carcinomas are rare in phenytoin induced gingival growth. Thus the findings provide further evidence that phenytoin induced gingival overgrowth as a non-neoplastic lesion, which may be considered as clinically significant given the fact that the epileptic patients are routinely administered with phenytoin for the rest of their lives to control seizure episodes.",

To elucidate the role of human DMP1 (hDMP1) in breast cancer, one hundred and ten pairs of human breast cancer specimen were studied for the alterations of the hDMP1-ARF-Hdm2-p53 pathway with follow up of clinical outcomes. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the hDMP1 locus was found in 42% of human breast carcinomas, while that of INK4a/ARF and p53 were found in 20 and 34%, respectively. Hdm2 amplification was found in 13% of the same sample, which was found independently of LOH for hDMP1. Conversely, LOH for hDMP1 was found in mutually exclusive fashion with that of INK4a/ARF and p53, and was associated with low Ki67 index and diploid karyotype. Consistently, LOH for hDMP1 was associated with luminal A category and longer relapse-free survival, while that of p53 was associated with non-luminal A and shorter survival. Thus, loss of hDMP1 could define a new disease category associated with prognosis of breast cancer patients. Human breast epithelial cells/cancer cells with wild-type p53 were sensitive to growth inhibition by activated Dmp1:ER while those that delete p14(ARF) or p53, and/or Hdm2 amplification showed partial or nearly complete resistance, indicating that p53 is a critical target for hDMP1 to exhibit its biological activity.",

We have studied the prevalence of p16 protein expression in breast carcinomas in a prospective series of 368 invasive and 52 non-invasive malignancies, as well as in 88 locally recurring tumours and three tumour cell lines. p16 protein expression was evaluated immunohistochemically on paraffin sections using monoclonal and polyclonal anti-p16 antibodies, and by immunoblotting of tumour cell suspensions. Tumour cell lines were also subjected to polymerase chain reaction-single strand polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing. The results were compared with established prognostic parameters, DNA flow cytometry and p53 protein expression. In 33 (9%) invasive and two (4%) intraductal carcinomas, a cytoplasmic accumulation of the p16 protein was seen. These cases were characterized by poor histological grade of differentiation, loss of of oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors and frequent overexpression of the p53 protein. In addition, breast carcinomas with aberrant p16 expression demonstrated a high proliferative activity, with median S-phase fractions 74% higher than in the control group and the median Ki67 fractions elevated to 75%. A genetic alteration of the p16 gene was not detectable in three analysed cell lines with cytoplasmic p16 expression applying PCR-SSCP and direct DNA sequencing. These results indicate that cytoplasmic accumulation of the p16 protein identifies a subset of highly malignant breast carcinomas with accelerated tumour proliferation and other unfavourable parameters in breast cancer.

The present study was designed to determine the potential utility of p16(INK4a) as a diagnostic marker for CIN and invasive cervical cancer in HIV-positive and negative cervical specimens. An immunohistochemical analysis of p16(INK4a) was performed in 326 cervical tissue microarray specimens. Performance indicators were calculated and compared using receiving operating characteristics curve (ROC)/area under the curve. In HIV-1-negative women, the percentage of cells that was positive for p16(INK4a) expression was significantly correlated with the severity of CIN (p < 0.0001). A ROC curve with a cut-off value of 55.28% resulted in a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive value of 91% and a negative predictive value of 78%. HIV-seropositive women exhibited decreased expression of p16(INK4a) in CIN2-3 specimens compared with HIV-negative specimens (p = 0.031). The ROC data underscore the potential utility of p16(INK4a) under defined conditions as a diagnostic marker for CIN 2-3 staging and invasive cervical cancer. HIV-1 infection, however, is associated with relatively reduced p16(INK4a) expression in CIN 2-3.",

The present study was therefore conducted to analyze p16((INK4a)) methylation and its relationship to clinicopathological features, mRNA levels and immunoreactivity in a series of lesions.;p16((INK4a)) methylation was assessed for normal mucosa (n = 30) and CRC samples (n = 212) by methylation-specific real-time quantitative PCR, and p16((INK4a)) expression by immunostaining in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. In addition, fresh DNA (n = 61) was analyzed for relationships to p16((INK4a)) mRNA by reverse-transcription PCR.;The p16((INK4a)) methylation index of normal mucosa samples ranged from 0 to 2% (mean, 0.23%; median, 0.02%), while the values for tumor samples varied widely from 0 to 100% (mean, 25.7%; median, 7.1%), the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.001). Of 151 paraffin-embedded CRC tissue samples, 51 (34%), 54 (36%), and 46 (30%) were classified as low, intermediate, and high for aberrant methylation of p16((INK4a)). High p16((INK4a)) methylation was significantly associated with large tumor size (P = 0.025). Patients with higher methylation further showed more frequent recurrence as compared with the low-methylation group, and shortened cancer-related survival (Hazard ratio [HR], 3.379; P < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (HR, 3.962; P < 0.001 on multivariate analysis). A significant inverse relationship was apparent between the p16((INK4a)) methylation and immunoreactivity (P = 0.017). A similar tendency was also observed for the methylation status and the mRNA level (P = 0.195).;We conclude that p16((INK4a)) methylation results in transcriptional silencing and defines a group of CRCs with a poor prognosis.",

To determine whether this difference can be translated into a therapeutic advantage to protect normal cells from adverse cytotoxicity caused by chemotherapy, we established cell model systems for ecdysone-inducible expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), and p27(Kip1) in one CKI-responsive cell line (A431 human vulvar epidermoid carcinoma cells with functional Rb) and one CKI-unresponsive cell line (SiHa human cervical cancer cells with nonfunctional Rb). Expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) in both SiHa and A431 cells strongly inhibited CDK2 activity, indicating functional expression of the CDK inhibitors in both cell lines. However, only in A431 cells did expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) cause Rb dephosphorylation, arrest cell cycle traversal, and potently inhibit cell proliferation. Induction of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) in SiHa cells failed to cause Rb dephosphorylation or to arrest cell cycle traversal, and such induction only minimally inhibited cell proliferation. We then compared the chemosensitivity of clones derived from these two cell lines when the CKIs were and were not induced. Induction of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) conferred strong resistance to paclitaxel- or cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity on the CKI-responsive A431 cells but not on the CKI-unresponsive SiHa cells.

Previously, we found that lack or reduced expression of p14(ARF) is involved in the maintenance of aneuploid cells in primary human cells, suggesting that it could be part of a pathway controlling their proliferation. To investigate this aspect further, p14(ARF) was ectopically expressed in HCT116 cells after depletion of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint MAD2 protein that was used as a trigger for aneuploidy. p14(ARF) Re-expression reduced the number of aneuploid cells in MAD2 post-transcriptionally silenced cells. Also aberrant mitoses, frequently displayed in MAD2-depleted cells, were decreased when p14(ARF) was expressed at the same time. In addition, p14(ARF) ectopic expression in MAD2-depleted cells induced apoptosis associated with increased p53 protein levels. Conversely, p14(ARF) ectopic expression did not induce apoptosis in HCT116 p53KO cells.

In an initial sample of 938 (aged 65-80 years) from the EPIC study (Norfolk, UK), the rs2811712 SNP minor allele (located between the shared p16(INK4a)/ARF locus and p15(INK4b)) was associated with reduced physical impairment. This association remained after testing an additional 1319 EPIC-Norfolk samples (p-value=0.013, total n=2257), and on independent replication in the InCHIANTI study (n=709, p=0.015), and at one-sided significance in Iowa-EPESE (n=419, p=0.079).

Triple-matched samples (cancerous tissues, matched adjacent normal tissues and serum samples) from breast cancer patients were screened for TP53 mutations, and the promoter methylation profile of P14(ARF), MDM2, TP53 and PTEN genes was analyzed as well as mtDNA alterations, including D-loop mutations and mtDNA content. In the studied cohort, no mutation was found in TP53 (DNA-binding domain). Comparison of P14(ARF) and PTEN methylation patterns showed significant hypermethylation levels in tumor tissues (P < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively) whereas the TP53 tumor suppressor gene was not hypermethylated (P < 0.511). The proportion of PTEN methylation was significantly higher in serum than in the normal tissues and it has a significant correlation to tumor tissues (P < 0.05). mtDNA analysis revealed 36.36% somatic and 90.91% germline mutations in the D-loop region and also significant mtDNA depletion in tumor tissues (P < 0.01). In addition, the mtDNA content in matched serum was significantly lower than in the normal tissues (P < 0.05).

Previous studies have shown the existence of allelic imbalance (loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability) in BCC on several human chromosomes. Chromosome region 9p21-p22 harbors the CDKN2a/p16INK4a, p19ARF, and p15INK4b tumor suppressor genes. To determine the contribution of these genes to the development of basal cell carcinomas we looked for evidence of allelic imbalance in 67 sporadic basal cell carcinoma specimens from Greek patients and screened 28 of them presenting loss of heterozygosity at 9p21-p22 for germline mutations in p16INK4a and p19ARF genes. Chromosome regions 17q21 and 17p13 were also screened for allelic imbalance in all the 67 basal cell carcinoma specimens. Overall, 69% (46 of 67) of the specimens displayed loss of heterozygosity in at least one microsatellite marker, whereas only six of the 67 (9%) exhibited microsatellite instability. For the 9p21-p22 locus the overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity reached 55% (37 of 67) and is the highest reported. The overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity for the 17q21 locus is 34% (22 of 64) and for the 17p13 locus is 11% (seven of 65). Two of the 28 loss of heterozygosity positive cases were heterozygous for a previously described polymorphism, Ala148Thr, in exon 2 of the CDKN2a gene. This is the first demonstration of polymorphism in the CDKN2a gene in human basal cell carcinomas. No sequence variation in exon 1beta of the p19ARF gene was found. Our results provide evidence of a significantly high occurrence of loss of heterozygosity for the 9p21-p22 locus; however, lack of p16INK4a/p19ARF mutation suggests that these genes seem not to be implicated by mutational inactivation in the development of basal cell carcinoma.

Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p16(INK4a) and the development of multiple chromosomal abnormalities are features of angiosarcoma that are recapitulated during telomerase-mediated immortalization of human ECs in vitro. The present study used a panel of telomerase-immortalized bone marrow EC (BMEC) lines to define the consequences of inactivation of p16(INK4a) on EC function and to identify molecular changes associated with repression of p16(INK4a). In a comparison of two immortalized BMEC mass cultures and six clones, the cell lines that repressed p16(INK4a) showed a higher rate of proliferation and an impaired ability to undergo morphogenic differentiation and form vessel-like structures in vitro. Proteomic comparison of a p16(INK4a)-negative and a p16(INK4a)-positive BMEC mass culture at early- and late-passage time points following transduction with telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) revealed altered expression of cytoskeletal proteins, including vimentin and α-tropomyosin (αTm), in the immortal cells. Immunoblot analyses of a panel of 11 immortal clones showed that cells that lacked p16(INK4a) expression tended to accumulate more dramatic changes in these cytoskeletal proteins than cells that retained p16(INK4a) expression. This corresponded with aberrant cytoskeletal architectures among p16(INK4a)-negative clones, which featured thicker actin stress fibers and less fluid membrane ruffles than p16(INK4a)-positive cells. A direct link between p16(INK4a) repression and defective EC function was confirmed by analysis of normal cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting p16(INK4a). siRNA-mediated repression of p16(INK4a) significantly impaired random motility and vessel formation in vitro. This report is the first to demonstrate that ECs that repress the expression of p16(INK4a) are prone to defects in motility, morphogenesis and cytoskeletal organization. These defects are likely to reflect alterations that occur during the development of EC-derived malignancies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Joint predisposition to malignant melanoma and nervous system tumors (NSTs) is a puzzle. Several melanoma susceptibility genes have been identified, including p16, a clustered tumor suppressor. However, the molecular bases of inherited proclivity to NSTs in the absence of a recognizable genetic syndrome are unknown. We analyzed two families with joint proneness to melanoma and NSTs in view of genetic linkage and identification of the causal molecular lesions. Highly informative linkage markers were used for segregation analyses of the predisposition alleles in the two pedigrees. Characterization of the molecular lesions required hemizygosity mapping based on microsatellite markers physically mapped to contigs of the 9p21 region and a Southern blot approach using several PCR-generated probes. Both families were found to be allelic and linked to p16 markers. In the family segregating the melanoma/NST syndrome, a large germ-line deletion ablated the whole p16, p19, and p15 gene cluster (or INK4 locus), whereas a more circumscribed molecular lesion disrupting p16 and p19 but leaving p15 unaltered segregated with the melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome (MIM 155755). Our results suggest that multiple cancer susceptibility in these two families ensues from contiguous tumor suppressor gene deletion. Indeed, known phenotypes associated with germ-line p16 mutations and an apparent correlation between the deletion span and tumor spectrum in the two families suggest a new model of cancer pathogenesis based on the inactivation of contiguous tumor suppressor genes, an alternative to the established pleiotropic effects of single-gene disruption.",

We previously found that during fibrosarcoma (FS) progression, GR displays only modest transcriptional activity in the preneoplastic stages, whereas it is highly active in FS cells. Now, we report that glucocorticoids reduce proliferation throughout FS development. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a) is frequently absent in many cancers, including FSs. We observed that p16(INK4a) protein expression is lost at the tumor stage of FS progression. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restores p16(INK4a) expression and reverts the phenotype of FS cells to low GR transcriptional activity, similar to that of the p16(INK4a)-expressing preneoplastic stages. Importantly, exogenous p16(INK4a) introduced by cotransfection is sufficient to reduce GR activity in FS cells, without affecting GR activity in p16-positive aggressive fibromatosis cells. Furthermore, GR transcriptional activity is elevated in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from INK4a(-/-) mice compared with those derived from WT mice, implying that the difference in p16(INK4a) expression is sufficient to modulate GR activity. These results suggest a relationship between steroid hormone receptor activity and cell cycle inhibition, whereby absence of p16(INK4a) protein leads to higher GR transactivation activity and reduced cell sensitivity to dexamethasone. This observation might have important implications for current cancer therapies.",

The identification of two cell cycle regulators, CDKN2 and CDKN2B, that map to the common region of deletion has prompted the hypothesis that they are critical tumor suppressor genes in this malignancy. However, controversy as to whether these genes are the only or even the most important target in bladder cancer oncogenesis remains. To more clearly determine the effect of these 9p21 alterations, we mapped the homozygous deletions and performed a detailed mutational and expression analysis for CDKN2, CDKN2B and a closely linked gene, methylthioadenoside phosphorylase (MTAP), in 16 established bladder cancer cell lines. Nine of the 16 lines exhibit large (30 to > 2000 kb) homozygous deletions on 9p21. All deletions include at least one exon of CDKN2, eight of nine include CDKN2B, and six of nine include MTAP. MTAP function correlates with the genomic deletions. SSCP and sequence analysis does not reveal any inactivating point mutations of CDKN2 or of CDKN2B in any of the cell lines without homozygous deletions, and all express the CDKN2 and the CDKN2B mRNA as well as the encoded p16 protein. The p16 protein levels vary widely and are correlated with absent pRb expression. We conclude that the 9p21 deletions in bladder cancer usually inactivate the CDKN2. CDKN2B, and MTAP genes but that CDKN2 is the most common target. Other mechanisms for inactivating this gene in bladder cancer appear to be uncommon.",

Immunohistochemistry of ESCC tissue sections indicated that the CtBP2 and p16(INK4A) expressions were inversely correlated to each other with a linear regression coefficient of -0.747 (P < 0.05), and Western blot analysis revealed that CtBP2 was higher expressed in tumorous tissues than in adjacent non-tumorous tissues.

We also observed that CtBP2 modulated the cell proliferation and cell cycle in ECA109 cells, an ESCC cell line, by inhibiting p16(INK4A) . Overexpression or knockdown of CtBP2 in ECA109 cells was found to inhibit or activate the mRNA or protein expression of p16(INK4A) , which in turn altered the cell proliferation and cell cycle in ECA109 cells, as measured by flow cytometry and cell count assay. Additionally, after ECA109 cells silenced for CtBP2 were treated with cisplatin (an anti-ESCC agent), the p16(INK4A) expression was up-regulated, and the cell apoptosis was promoted, thus confirming the repression of p16(INK4A) by CtBP2.

Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the presence of endogenous interaction of Id1 and E47 proteins that was strong in young 2BS cells and weakened during replicative senescence and, thereby, influenced the transcription activation of p16(INK4a) by E47. Furthermore, we found that E47 protein could bind to the E-box-containing region in p16(INK4a) promoter in senescent cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, suggesting that E47 is indeed ultimately involved in the regulation of p16(INK4a) transcription in vivo. Silencing Id1 expression in young cells by RNA interference induced an increased p16(INK4a) level and premature cellular senescence, whereas silencing E47 expression inhibited the expression of p16(INK4a) and delayed the onset of senescent phenotype. The present study demonstrated not only the capacity of Id1 to regulate p16(INK4a) gene expression by E47, but also the phenotypic consequence of the regulation on cellular senescence, moreover, raised the possibility of Id1-specific gene silencing for human cancer therapy.",

There are no reports on its expression in benign and borderline tumors. This study aims to determine p14, p16 and p53 expression frequencies in ovarian benign, borderline and malignant tumors and their associations with clinical parameters.;A cross-sectional study utilizing immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded ovarian epithelial tumor samples. Clinical data were collected from medical records. Fisher's exact test and the Bonferroni correction were performed for frequency associations. Survival comparisons utilized Kaplan-Meier and log rank testing. Associations were considered significant when p < 0.05.;p14 absent expression was associated with malignant tumors (60 % positive) (p = 0.000), while 93 % and 94 % of benign and borderline tumors, respectively, were positive. p16 was positive in 94.6 % of carcinomas, 75 % of borderline and 45.7 % of benign tumors (p = 0.000). p53 negative staining was associated with benign tumors (2.9 % positive) (p = 0.016) but no difference was observed between borderline (16.7 %) and malignant tumors (29.7 %) (p = 0.560). No associations were found between expression rates, disease-free survival times or clinical variables. Carcinoma subtypes showed no difference in expression.;This is the first description of p14 expression in benign and borderline tumors. It remains stable in benign and borderline tumors, while carcinomas show a significant absence of staining. This may indicate that p14 abnormalities occur later in carcinogenesis. p16 and p53 frequencies increase from benign to borderline and malignant tumors, similarly to previous reports, possibly reflecting the accumulation of inactive mutant protein. The small sample size may have prevented statistically significant survival analyses and clinical correlations. Future studies should investigate genetic abnormalities in p14 coding sequences and include all types of ovarian epithelial tumors. Bigger sample sizes may be needed for significant associations.",

All samples were formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded, and immunohistochemical analysis was carried out using a mouse monoclonal anti-p16(INK4A) antibody after antigen unmasking. The staining intensity was assessed using a 0 to 3 scoring system. In addition, the expression status of p16(INK4A) was examined in 12 normal ThinPrep smears, one smear exhibiting cGIN, and a total of 20 smears exhibiting mild, moderate, and severe dyskaryosis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) detection was carried out using a modified SYBR green assay system. Fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and solution phase PCR were used for specific HPV typing.;p16(INK4A) immunoreactivity was absent in all normal cervical tissues examined. Dysplastic squamous and glandular cells were positive for p16(INK4A) expression in all cases included in this study, except for one CIN3 case. p16(INK4A) expression was mainly nuclear in CIN1 cases, and both nuclear and cytoplasmic in CIN2, CIN3, cGIN, and invasive cases.

In general, the p16(INK4A) staining intensity was lower in cases negative for HPV or those containing a low risk HPV type.;This pattern of overexpression demonstrates the potential use of p16(INK4A) as a diagnostic marker for cervical squamous and also glandular neoplastic lesions. In addition, the technique can be used to identify individual dyskaryotic cells in ThinPrep smears. Thus, p16(INK4A) is a useful marker of cervical dyskaryosis.",

The aim of our study was to assess the clinical impact of Id-1 expression in breast cancer, i.e., its potential impact on prognosis and prediction of treatment response. Id-1 protein expression was determined immunohistochemically in 191 patients with lymph-node negative breast cancer, and univariate and multivariate survival analysis was carried out. Fifteen (7.9%) specimens showed strong expression, 75 (39.3%) moderate, 55 (28.8%) weak expression and 46 (24.1%) cases no expression of Id-1. Patients with strong or moderate Id-1 expression had a significant shorter overall (p = 0.003, Cox regression) and disease-free survival (p = 0.01, Cox regression) compared to those with absent or low expression. Progesterone receptor density was significantly higher in breast cancers with absent/low Id-1 expression compared to those with moderate/strong expression (p < 0.001, t-test). Id-1 expression was significantly stronger in cases positive for p16(INK4a) expression compared to those negative for p16 (p = 0.049, Mann-Whitney test). The influence of Id-1 on clinical outcome seems much stronger in patients with negative estrogen receptor status compared to those with positive status, who received receptor antagonists as adjuvant therapy in most cases. Overexpression of Id-1 protein represents a strong independent prognostic marker in node negative breast cancer, and future therapies inhibiting Id-1 expression might be beneficial for these patients.

METHODS.: Four hundred ThinPrep specimens (100 each in 4 categories: 100 specimens that were negative for intraepithelial lesions, 100 specimens of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], 100 specimens of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [LSILs], and 100 specimens of HSILs) were analyzed. p16(INK4a) protein was immunolocalized using a specific monoclonal antibody, and the detection of HR HPV in all 400 specimens was determined using HC2.;p16(INK4a) was found to be positive in 78% of HSIL specimens, 42% of LSIL specimens, and 36% of ASC-US specimens; whereas HC2 was positive in 92% of HSIL specimens, 81% of LSIL specimens, and 45% of ASC-US specimens. In the HSIL category, the sensitivity, which was calculated using Grade 2 or greater cervical intraepithelial neoplasia as the endpoint, was 78% (50 of 66 specimens) for p16(INK4a) and 91% (60 of 66 specimens) for HC2. For LSIL, the sensitivity was 75% (3 of 4 specimens) for p16(INK4a) and 100% (4 of 4 specimens) for HC2. In the ASC-US category, the sensitivity was 89% (8 of 9 specimens) for p16(INK4a) and 100% (9 of 9 specimens) for HC2. Overall, the sensitivity for HSIL was 92% for HC2 and 78% for p16(INK4a). The specificity for HC2 was 8.3% for HSIL, 16.9% for LSIL, and 48.7% for ASC-US; whereas the specificity for p16(INK4a) was 25% in HSIL, 59.1% in LSIL, and 68.4% in ASC-US.

While epigenetic inactivation of the p16(INK4a) gene promoter has been shown to be associated with increased tobacco carcinogen exposure, little investigation of any similar association of homozygous deletion or mutation of p16(INK4a) and tobacco use has been completed. In 177 consecutive NSCLCs, we examined the determinants of p16(INK4a) homozygous deletion and mutation, including the pattern of tobacco smoking and asbestos exposure. We observed that p16(INK4a) homozygous deletion occurred at a higher frequency in never smokers as compared to former and current smokers (p = 0.01). This observation suggested that tumors from these patients might be more prone to DNA deletion events; consistent with this, epigenetic silencing of the DNA double-strand break repair genes FancF and BRCA1 was also associated with homozygous deletion of p16(INK4a)(p = 0.002 and p = 0.06, respectively). Finally, mutation of p16(INK4a) was rare and only occurred in patients who were smokers. Hence, the character of somatic alteration in the Rb pathway (deletion, mutation or methylation silencing) in NSCLC is associated with the pattern of tobacco exposure, suggesting that susceptibility to lung cancer is, at least in part, mediated by the biological mechanism that selects for the character of the induced somatic lesion.",

We designed this study to evaluate the biologic and potential therapeutic roles of p14(ARF) expression in mesothelioma cells.;We constructed Adp14, an adenoviral vector carrying human p14(ARF) complementary DNA, and used it to transfect human mesothelioma cell lines H28, H513, H2052, and MSTO-211H. Overexpression of p14(ARF) led to increased amounts of p53 and the p21(WAF) proteins and dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. The growth rate of mesothelioma cells was inhibited markedly by infection with Adp14 compared with mock infection or infection with a control adenovirus vector, AdCtrl. Overexpression of p14(ARF) induced G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. Cytotoxicity assays showed that Adp14 had a statistically significantly (P =.002) greater effect on colon cancer (HCT116) cell lines containing two copies of the wild-type p53 gene than on p53-null cells, suggesting that functional p53 is a critical determinant of p14(ARF)-mediated cytotoxicity.;The transfection of p14(ARF) into mesothelioma cells led to the overexpression of p14(ARF), which resulted in G(1)-phase arrest and apoptotic cell death.

        "Doc_abstract":"The UVB component of the solar spectrum induces DNA lesions that, in the absence of error-free DNA repair, may give rise during DNA replication to mutations in caretaker and gatekeeper genes. The DNA repair genes are the best candidates for caretaker genes as exemplified by the human hereditary xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) syndrome. Cultured XP cells are hypermutable after UVB irradiation. This increased mutation frequency is also found in gatekeeper genes, which govern signalling pathways implicated in the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival of human epidermal keratinocytes. We describe and discuss the role of mutated gatekeeper genes in five specific signalling pathways which have been implicated in skin carcinogenesis. The pathways we focus on in this review are: (i) P16(INK4A)-CDK4/6-RB; (ii) P14(ARF)-HDM2-P53; (iii) Sonic hedgehog (SHH)/GLI; (iv) WNT/beta-catenin; and (v) Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)/SMAD. 70-80% of XP skin cancers exhibit one or several mutations in the P53, PTCH-1, SMO or CDKN2A genes, the type and frequency of mutated genes being different between squamous cell (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). In XP cancers, the typically UVB-induced CC to TT tandem transitions represent approximately 60% of total mutations compared to 10-15% in skin tumours from DNA repair-proficient patients. Acquired activation of the pathways described herein can alter proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, allowing a damaged cell to replicate and give rise to mutated daughter cells, then eventually to the development of the carcinogenic process following clonal selection.",

Kamb et al., Science (Washington DC), 264: 436-440, 1994] as encoding a 148-amino-acid protein termed p16. The p16 protein associates exclusively with Cdk4 and Cdk6, inhibiting their complexation with D-type cyclins and the consequent phosphorylation of pRb. This contributes to cell cycle arrest. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate patterns of p16 expression in a well-characterized cohort of prostatic adenocarcinomas while exploring potential associations between alterations of p16 and clinicopathological variables. Normal and malignant tissues from 88 patients with prostate carcinoma were examined. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry assays were used to determine the status of the INK4A exon 1alpha transcripts and levels of p16 protein, respectively. Associations between altered patterns of expression and clinicopathological variables, including pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason grade, pathological stage, and hormonal status, were evaluated using the Mantel-Haenszel chi2 test. Biochemical (PSA) relapse after surgery was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Levels of p16 expression and INK4A exon 1alpha transcripts in normal prostate and benign hyperplastic tissues were undetectable. However, p16 nuclear overexpression was observed in 38 (43%) prostate carcinomas, whereas the remaining 50 (57%) cases showed undetectable p16 levels. Overexpression of p16 protein was found to correlate with increased INK4A exon 1alpha transcripts. Moreover, p16 overexpression was associated with a higher pretreatment PSA level (P = 0.018), the use of neoadjuvant androgen ablation (P = 0.001), and a sooner time to PSA relapse after radical prostatectomy (P = 0.002). These data suggest that p16 overexpression is associated with tumor recurrence and a poor clinical course in patients with prostate cancer.",

Absence of expression of the p16(INK4a) gene product is exhibited in virtually all mesothelioma tumors and cell lines examined to date. Loss of p16(INK4a) expression has also been frequently observed in more common neoplasms such as lung cancer as well. In a wide variety of these malignancies, including lung cancer, p16(INK4a) expression is known to be inactivated by hypermethylation of the first exon. In a survey of ten mesothelioma cell lines, one cell line (NCI-H2596) was identified as possessing loss of p16(INK4a) gene product following gene methylation. This methylation in these mesothelioma cells could be reversed, resulting in re-expression of p16(INK4a) protein, following the treatment of the cells with cytidine analogs, which are known inhibitors of DNA methylation. In previous clinical trials in mesothelioma, the cytidine analog dihydro-5-azacytidine (DHAC) has been found to induce clinical responses in approximately 17% of patients with mesothelioma treated with this drug, including prolonged complete responses. In addition, we identified evidence for methylation of p16(INK4a) in three of 11 resected mesothelioma tumor samples. When both cell lines and tumors are combined, inactivation of p16(INK4a) gene product expression following DNA hypermethylation was found in four of 21 samples (19%). We are further exploring the clinical significance of inhibition of methylation in mesothelioma by cytidine analogs. This may provide a potential treatment target in some mesothelioma tumors by inhibition of methylation.",

EZH2 is part of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and trimethylates H3K27. This histone mark recruits the BMI1-containing PRC1 that silences the genes marked by PRC2. Based on their role in stem cells, EZH2 and BMI1 have been predicted to contribute to a poor outcome for cancer patients.;We have analysed the expression of EZH2 and BMI1 in a well-characterised dataset of 295 human breast cancer samples.;Interestingly, although EZH2 overexpression correlates with a poor prognosis in breast cancer, BMI1 overexpression correlates with a good outcome. Although this may reflect transformation of different cell types, we also observed a functional difference. The PcG-target genes INK4A and ARF are not expressed in tumours with high BMI1, but they are expressed in tumours with EZH2 overexpression. ARF expression results in tumour protein P53 (TP53) activation, and we found a significantly higher proportion of TP53 mutations in tumours with high EZH2. This may explain why tumours with high EZH2 respond poorly to therapy, in contrast to tumours with high BMI1.;Overall, our data highlight that whereas EZH2 and BMI1 may function in a 'linear' pathway in normal development, their overexpression has different functional consequences for breast tumourigenesis.",

Although p16(INK4a) immunohistology is routinely used as a cost effective surrogate marker, many of the published articles are confusing and contradictory. The discrepancies can be ascribed to a multitude of factors operating at the molecular, technical and interpretative levels. In the first place, our simplistic model of viral mediated oncogenesis is speculative and fails to account for all the known biomolecular changes. Unresolved technical issues include the variables of tissue fixation, antibody dilution, antibody isotype and clone, and the sensitivity of the particular detection method. Within any controlled staining method, strong diffuse or 'block' immunoreactivity in squamous cells may be found in moderate/severe dysplasia (CIN 2/3) and invasive squamous carcinoma. In contrast, focal or multifocal reactivity in squamous cells may be artefactual, related to low risk or HR-HPV. p16(INK4a) is less reliable when dealing with glandular lesions since considerable overlap exists between reactive and dysplastic lesions. In addition not all glandular dysplasias/carcinomas are HR-HPV related, nor are all p16(INK4a) immunoreactive lesions associated with HR-HPV. We conclude that p16(INK4a) immunoperoxidase shows greater specificity than sensitivity for squamous lesions; in comparison, glandular dysplasias/carcinomas show reduced specificity and sensitivity. Like all cell cycle regulatory proteins, the future diagnostic role of p16(INK4a) is limited. The ideal diagnostic molecular test for cervical dysplasias will detect a HR-HPV related product after, but not before, cell transformation and will reliably predict those cases yet to experience disease progression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"p16(INK4a) is frequently altered in human cancer, often through epigenetically mediated transcriptional silencing. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of this gene. To learn more about such control, we initiated studies of proteins that bind to the promoter in cancer cells that do, and do not, express the gene. We identify RNA helicase A (RHA) as a protein that binds much better to the p16(INK4a) promoter in the expressing cells. RHA has not previously been characterized to manifest sequence-specific DNA interaction but does so to the sequence 5' CGG ACC GCG TGC GC 3' in the p16(INK4a) promoter. The Drosophila homologue to RHA, maleless (Mle), functions in the fly for 2-fold activation of male X-chromosome genes. In our experimental setting, RHA induces a similar modest up-regulation of the p16(INK4a) promoter that is dependent upon its sequence-specific interaction. Mle colocalizes with hyperacetylated H4Ac16 on the X-chromosome and some autosomal loci. The decreased binding of RHA to p16(INK4a) in our cells, where the gene is transcriptionally inactive, is associated with decreased amounts of RHA that immunoprecipitate with acetylated lysine antibodies. Finally, we show RHA to be a cellular substrate for caspase-3, which decreases its sequence-specific binding to p16(INK4a) by cleavage of the N terminus. Thus, we have identified a new protein interaction with the p16(INK4a) promoter that involves an important protein for transcriptional modulation. This interaction is decreased in cancer cells, where this gene is aberrantly transcriptionally silent.",

However, it remains unclear which biomarker(s) can reliably determine which OPSCC specimens are truly driven by HPV infection. In this study, we analyzed 199 fresh-frozen OPSCC specimens for HPV DNA, viral load, RNA expression patterns typical for cervical carcinomas (CxCaRNA(+)), and the HPV-targeted tumor suppressor protein p16(INK4a) as markers for HPV infection. In this set of specimens, there was a 49% prevalence of DNA for the cancer-associated HPV type 16 (HPV(+)). However, there was only a 16% prevalence of high viral load and only a 20% prevalence of CxCaRNA(+), a marker of HPV16 carcinogenic activity. Among the CxCaRNA(+) tumors, 78% of the specimens exhibited overexpression of p16(INK4a), which also occurred in 14% of the HPV-negative tumors. Using a multivariate survival analysis with HPV negativity as the reference group, CxCaRNA(+) as a single marker conferred the lowest risk of death [HR = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.13-0.61] from oropharyngeal cancer, closely followed by high viral load (HR = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.14-0.73). In contrast, a weaker inverse association was found for OPSCC that were HPV(+) and p16(INK4a) high (HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.29-1.08).

Forty-one percent of the benign, 50% of the LMP and most (71%) of the malignant tumours showed high pRB expression. High expression of pRB (>50% pRB-positive cells) significantly correlated with non-mucinous histological subtypes. Reduced pRB expression, substage and residual disease were significant predictors for poor prognosis in stage I patients. All the benign and most of the LMP (81%) tumours were in either the p53-negative or low p53-positive category, but nearly half of the malignant tumours had high p53 expression. High p53 accumulation was found in non-mucinous, high grade and late stage tumours. For well-differentiated carcinomas, high p53 expression was a predictor of poor prognosis. However, even though high p53 expression was not associated with histological subtype, stage or the presence of residual disease, high p53 expression was not an independent predictor when all clinical parameters were combined. For all ovarian cancers, a close correlation was found between high p53 and high p16 expression. The relationship between the expression of pRB and p16 depended on tumour stage. In stage I tumours, high pRB was associated with low p16 reactivity. On the other hand, most advanced tumours showed both high pRB and high p16 reactivity.",

Therefore, the CDK4I gene is thought to be a putative tumor-suppressor gene. We report here that both alleles of the CDK4I gene were completely or partially deleted in human leukemia cells derived from both patients and established cell lines. Thirty-seven hematopoietic cell lines and samples from 72 patients with leukemias were examined for homozygous loss of the CDK4I gene locus by Southern blot analysis. We found that a part or the whole of the CDK4I gene was homozygously deleted in 14 of the 37 (38%) cell lines and 4 of 72 (6%) samples from leukemia patients, including 45 with acute myelocytic leukemia, 14 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 13 with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis. In the cell lines, the homozygous deletion of the CDK4I gene was detected in a variety of cell lineages, whereas all 4 cases showing the homozygous deletion were confined to ALL. It should be noted that 2 of them had no cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 9.

The most common mechanism of inactivation of this gene in human cancers is through homozygous deletion; however, in a smaller proportion of tumours and tumour cell lines intragenic mutations occur. In this study we have compiled a database of over 120 published point mutations in the CDKN2 gene from a wide variety of tumour types. A further 50 deletions, insertions, and splice mutations in CDKN2 have also been compiled. Furthermore, we have standardised the numbering of all mutations according to the full-length 156 amino acid form of p16. From this study we are able to define several hot spots, some of which occur at conserved residues within the ankyrin domains of p16. While many of the hotspots are shared by a number of cancers, the relative importance of each position varies, possibly reflecting the role of different carcinogens in the development of certain tumours. As reported previously, the mutational spectrum of CDKN2 in melanomas differs from that of internal malignancies and supports the involvement of UV in melanoma tumorigenesis. Notably, 52% of all substitutions in melanoma-derived samples occurred at just six nucleotide positions.

Its activity is specifically regulated by p16 (also known as p16/CDKN2A, p16(INK4a), and MTS1), a tumor suppressor frequently altered in human cancers. A specific mutation in CDK4 codon 24 (Arginine to Cysteine) prevents p16 binding and thus inhibition by p16. This mutated CDK4 acts as a dominant oncogene and has been found in both sporadic and familial melanoma. To study the effects of other mutations in CDK4, we generated a panel of 18 CDK4 mutants using Charged-to-Alanine scanning mutagenesis, and investigated the p16-binding capacity of these mutants to identify novel sites involved in p16 binding. The mutant CDK4 proteins were generated by direct coupled transcription-translation in vitro and tested for binding to p16 using a p16-GST fusion protein. Several mutants demonstrated loss of p16 binding. In addition to the previously identified codon 24 mutants, alterations in and around codon 22, 25, 97, and 281 all showed loss of p16 binding capacity. These results indicate that several noncontiguous amino acid sequences on CDK4 are required for binding to p16, which suggests the existence of multiple sites of interaction with p16.

Although analogous studies of rare nervous system tumors are needed, there are major barriers to performing such studies. Cross-species comparative oncogenomics, identifying driver mutations in mouse cancer models and validating them in human tumors, is a promising alternative. Although still in its infancy, this approach is being applied to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), rare Schwann cell-derived malignancies that occur sporadically, after radiotherapy, and in neurofibromatosis type 1. Studies of human neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors suggest that NF1 tumor suppressor loss in Schwann cells triggers cell-autonomous and intercellular changes, resulting in development of benign neurofibromas; subsequent neurofibroma-MPNST progression is caused by aberrant growth factor signaling and mutations affecting the p16(INK4A)-cyclin D1-CDK4-Rb and p19(ARF)-Mdm2-p53 cell cycle pathways. Mice with Nf1, Trp53, and/or Cdkn2a mutations that overexpress the Schwann cell mitogen neuregulin-1 or overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor validate observations in human tumors and, to various degrees, model human tumorigenesis. Genomic analyses of MPNSTs arising in neuregulin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing mice and forward genetic screens with Sleeping Beauty transposons implicate additional signaling cascades in MPNST pathogenesis. These studies confirm the utility of mouse models for MPNST driver gene discovery and provide new insights into the complexity of MPNST pathogenesis. ",

In a genetic screen for transcription factors regulating senescence, we identified the homeodomain-containing protein HLX1 (H2.0-like homeobox 1). Expression of HLX1 extends cellular lifespan and blunts oncogene-induced senescence. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified p16(INK4a) as the key target mediating the effects of HLX1 in senescence. HLX1 represses p16(INK4a) transcription by recruiting PRCs and HDAC1. This mechanism has broader implications, as HLX1 also regulates a subset of PRC targets besides p16(INK4a). Finally, sampling members of the Homeobox family, we identified multiple genes with ability to repress p16(INK4a). Among them, we found HOXA9 (Homeobox A9), a putative oncogene in leukaemia, which also recruits PRCs and HDAC1 to regulate p16(INK4a).

Twenty-three cases of surgically resected HBV-associated HCC and 25 fine-needle aspiration biopsy cases of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were studied. The methylation status of the p16(INK4A) promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two-step immunohistochemical staining showed the expression of viral antigens in situ. Tissue HBV-DNA levels were determined by fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR. PCR and the direct sequencing method were used for mutation analysis. In peritumoral tissues (P = 0.025) and CHB samples (P = 0.029), the expression of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) was higher in methylated groups of p16(INK4A) promoter than in unmethylated groups. Other HBV factors including hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen, tissue HBV-DNA levels and HBV x gene mutations had no relation to the methylation status of p16(INK4A) promoter. The data indicate that p16(INK4A) promoter hypermethylation correlated closely with higher HBx expression in the precancerous lesions, suggesting that HBx may play an important role in the early stage of HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis via induction of hypermethylation of p16(INK4A) promoter.",

However, the relevance of high-grade acute organ toxicity (HGAOT), which has also been correlated with improved prognosis, has attracted scant attention in HPV-positive HNSCC patients. Hence we tested the hypothesis that both parameters, HPV and HGAOT, are positive prognostic factors in patients with HNSCC treated with definite radiotherapy (RT) or radiochemotherapy (RCT).;Pretreatment tumor tissue and clinical records were available from 233 patients receiving definite RT (62 patients) or RCT (171 patients). HPV infection was analysed by means of HPV DNA detection or p16(INK4A) expression; HGAOT was defined as the occurrence of acute organ toxicity >grade 2 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria. Both variables were correlated with overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazards regression.;Positivity for HPV DNA (44 samples, 18.9 %) and p16(INK4A) expression (102 samples, 43.8 %) were significantly correlated (p < 0.01), and HGAOT occurred in 77 (33 %) patients. Overall, the 5-year OS was 23 %; stratified for p16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT, OS rates were 47 %, 42 %, 20 % and 10 % for patients with p16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT, patients with HGAOT only, patients with p16(INK4A) expression only, and patients without p16(INK4A) expression or HGAOT, respectively. After multivariate testing p16(INK4A) expression (p = 0.003) and HGAOT (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with OS.;P16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT are independent prognostic factors for OS of patients with HNSCC, whereas p16(INK4A) expression is particularly important for patients without HGAOT.",

The CDKN2 gene, which encodes the cell-cycle regulator p16, was recently shown to be mutated or deleted in many tumor cell lines. Its role in the genesis of primary tumors is uncertain, however. Tumor and corresponding normal DNAs were prepared by microdissection of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or from frozen surgical specimens of 15 papillary, 15 follicular, and five anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. The entire CDKN2 coding region was screened by single-strand conformational variant analysis and direct sequencing of variants. The presence of homozygous deletions was evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the CDKN2 region was assessed by using flanking polymorphic markers. Two somatic missense mutations were found among the 35 thyroid cancers, one in a follicular tumor and one in an anaplastic tumor. Multiplex PCR suggested the presence of homozygous deletion in one anaplastic tumor and hemizygous deletions in four tumors. LOH studies revealed loss of 9p sequences in four follicular (27%) and two anaplastic (50%) cancers. Our data suggest that alterations in CDKN2 played a role in a minority of thyroid cancers (three of 35). LOH in the region of CDKN2 is seen in a significant proportion of follicular and anaplastic but not papillary cancers.

The CDKN2A locus, which houses the INK4a and ARF tumor suppressor genes, is frequently altered in NSCLC. However, the specific role of ARF in pulmonary tumorigenesis remains unclear. KRAS and other oncogenes induce the expression of ARF, thus stabilizing p53 activity and arresting cell proliferation. To address the role of ARF in Kras-driven NSCLC, we compared the susceptibility of NIH/Ola strain wild-type and Arf-knockout mice to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis. Lung tumor size, malignancy and associated morbidity were significantly increased in Arf(-/-) compared with Arf(+/+) animals at 25 weeks after induction. Pulmonary tumors from Arf-knockout mice exhibited increased cell proliferation and DNA damage compared with wild-type mice. A subgroup of tumors in Arf(-/-) animals presented as dedifferentiated and metastatic, with many characteristics of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, a neoplasm previously undocumented in mouse models. Our finding of a role for ARF in NSCLC is consistent with the observation that benign adenomas from Arf(+/+) mice robustly expressed ARF, while ARF expression was markedly reduced in malignant adenocarcinomas. ARF expression also frequently colocalized with the expression of p21(CIP1), a transcriptional target of p53, arguing that ARF induces the p53 checkpoint to arrest cell proliferation in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that induction of ARF is an early response in lung tumorigenesis that mounts a strong barrier against tumor growth and malignant progression. ",

To determine the frequency of co-deletion of these two genes, we investigated 50 samples of primary NSCLC using a quantitative PCR-ELISA. All specimens were fixed in formalin, paraffin embedded and stored until assayed. Histologic subtypes included 25 adenocarcinomas (50%), 21 squamous cell carcinomas (42%) and four large cell carcinomas (8%). Homozygous deletions of MTAP exon 8 could be detected in 19 of 50 NSCLC samples (38%). Adenocarcinoma (11 of 25, 44%) showed a higher deletion frequency than squamous cell carcinoma (six of 21, 29%). In contrast, homozygous p16INK4A deletions were detected in only nine of 50 (18%) samples using specific primers for p16INK4A exon 1alpha. No difference between the histological subtypes and p16INK4A deletion frequency was observed. We further investigated the ten samples with MTAP deletions but intact p16INK4A exon 1alpha with primers specific for p16INK4A exon 3, the exon nearest to MTAP exon 8. Interestingly, none of the ten samples had deletion of the p16INK4A exon 3 coding region. Fine mapping analysis performed in ten samples showed a frequent breakpoint between MTAP exon 4 and exon 5. In addition, p16 protein expression could not be detected in five out of six samples with intact p16 but deleted MTAP locus. These data show a high frequency of homozygous MTAP deletions in NSCLC which is associated with detectable co-deletion of p16INK4A in only half of the cases. This result suggests the existence either of another tumor suppressor gene telomeric of p16INK4A or of deletions involving 3'-untranslated (3'-UTR) regulatory regions of p16INK4A that can interfere with its expression or function.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Liquid-based cytology (LBC) enables the use of supplementary methods in the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical lesions. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between p16-INK4a immunoexpression in ThinPrep cervical cytologic samples and human papillomavirus (HPV) detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the same sample. LBC-ThinPrep (Cytyc, USA) cervical cytology samples, prepared and stained by Papanicolaou method, were analyzed using modified Bethesda cytologic classification named \"Zagreb 2002\". A second ThinPrep slide, prepared from the same sample, was immunostained for p16INK4a using CINtec p16INK4a Cytology Kit (DakoCytomation, Denmark). Increased expression of the high-risk (HR) HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes results in a highly specific increase in p16 protein expression and overexpression of p16INK4a acts as a potential biomarker for cervical cancer progression from premalignant lesions. Brown nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining of abnormal cells was considered a positive result. Residual material was used for 13 HR HPV-DNA detection by the PCR based AMPLICOR HPV test (Roche Molecular Systems). A total of 120 ThinPrep Pap tests with the following cytologic diagnoses: 17 within normal limits, 17 atypical squamous cell (ASC) (7 ASC of undetermined significance /ASCUS/ and 10 ASC of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions cannot be excluded /ASC-H/), 26 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) corresponding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 57 high-grade SIL (HSIL) i.e. 24 CIN II and 33 CIN III and 3 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were included in the study. All CIN III (n = 33) and SCC (n = 3) specimens expressed p16INK4a immunoreactivity, whereas the HR HPV test was positive in 97% (32/33) of CIN III and 100% (3/3) of SCC specimens. The p16INK4a biomarker was positive in 87.5% (21/24) of CIN II and 69% (18/26) of CIN I, while the HR HPV was positive in 75% (18/24) of CIN II and 50% (13/26) of CIN I. In ASCUS cytology, p16INK4a and HR HPV showed the same rate of positivity (28.5%; 2/7). Expression of p16INK4a was detected in all cytologic (10/10) ASC-H lesions, in contrast to HR HPV detected in only 20% (2/10) of ASC-H cases. These data suggest the p16INK4a evaluation in ThinPrep cervical samples to be significantly associated with HR HPV testing by PCR in the same sample for the diagnosis of HSIL lesions and cervical carcinomas. A prospective study with longer follow up may clarify the predictive values in the management of LSIL and ASC diagnosis.",

In this study we examined cell-cycle proteins expression and correlation with human papillomavirus infection in a series of 15 pure penile verrucous carcinomas from a single centre. Of 148 penile tumours, 15 (10%) were diagnosed as pure verrucous carcinomas. The expression of the cell-cycle-associated proteins p53, p21, RB, p16(INK4A) and Ki67 were examined by immunohistochemistry. Human papillomavirus infection was determined by polymerase chain reaction to identify a wide range of virus types. The expression of p16(INK4A) and Ki67 was significantly lower in verrucous carcinoma than in usual type squamous cell carcinoma, whereas the expression of p53, p21 and RB was not significantly different. p53 showed basal expression in contrast to usual type squamous cell carcinoma. Human papillomavirus infection was present in only 3 out of 13 verrucous carcinomas. Unique low-risk, high-risk and mixed viral infections were observed in each of the three cases. In conclusion, lower levels of p16(INK4A) and Ki67 expressions differentiate penile verrucous carcinoma from usual type squamous cell carcinoma. The low Ki67 index reflects the slow-growing nature of verrucous tumours. The low level of p16(INK4A) expression and human papillomavirus detection suggests that penile verrucous carcinoma pathogenesis is unrelated to human papillomavirus infection and the oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes classically altered by virus infection.",

Although the p15(INK4b) gene displays high homology to the p16(INK4a) gene in the amino acid sequence, methylation of p15(INK4b) has not been fully studied. We investigated p15(INK4b) methylation status in patients with colorectal cancer to verify the association between the methylation of p15(INK4b) and clinicopathological features compared with p16(INK4a).;DNA samples from the tissues of primary colorectal cancer and corresponding adjacent normal colon mucosa were obtained from surgical resections of 88 patients (47 males and 41 females, aged 29-83 years). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a) methylation status after bisulfite modification. Cumulative survival rates (mean follow-up period: 53.2 months) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Methylations of p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a) genes were detected in 23 (26.1%) and 20 (22.7%) colorectal cancers, respectively.;Methylation of p15(INK4b) was not associated with any clinicopathological features. Compared with normal mucosa, the methylation of p15(INK4b) was more prominent in tumor tissue (P < 0.001).

Because p19INK4D has strong structural and functional similarity to p16INK4A, we have assessed its role as a tumor suppressor. This was accomplished by screening the p19INK4D coding region for mutations, deletions and rearrangements in sarcomas and non-small cell lung cancers. Alterations of the p19INK4D gene were found in samples from five of 67 (7%) patients with osteosarcomas and none were found in other types of sarcomas or in lung cancers. Five osteosarcoma samples had Southern blot patterns consistent with gene rearrangement. These samples included a primary and recurrent osteosarcoma from the same patient; both with the same rearrangement. Four samples had SSCP patterns consistent with sequence alterations, sequencing determined that three were due to silent base changes and apparently polymorphisms. Sequencing the fourth shifted band revealed a one base insertion causing a frameshift beginning with codon 27. In summary, these studies found alterations affecting the p19INK4D gene in a small but significant number of osteosarcomas.

Recent studies on colorectal and gastric cancer have identified a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), which involves the targeting of multiple genes by promoter hypermethylation. For determination of association between DNA methylation pattern or histological type and CIMP status in gastric carcinoma, CpG islands in the promoters of hMLH1 and CDH1 genes, CpG islands overlapping exon 1 of MGMT and p16(INK4a) genes, and a non-CpG island in exon 1 of the RAR-beta gene were studied. The presence of the CIMP was determined by monitoring five methylated in tumor (MINT ) loci in 103 gastric carcinomas. Among the 103 gastric carcinomas, DNA hypermethylation was detected in the following frequencies: 14 (14%) for hMLH1, 26 (25%) for MGMT, 26 (25%) for p16(INK4a), 54 (52%) for CDH1, and 53 (52%) for RAR-beta. Forty-two (41%) of 103 gastric carcinomas were positive for the CIMP. CIMP and hypermethylation of p16(INK4a) gene were found more frequently in intestinal and diffuse-adherent types than in diffuse-scattered type (P = 0.013 and 0.017, respectively). In contrast, hypermethylation of the CDH1 and RAR-beta genes was more common in the diffuse-scattered type than in the other types (P = 0.008 and 0.007, respectively). In intestinal- and diffuse-adherent-type gastric carcinomas, we found significant associations between the presence of the CIMP and hypermethylation of several genes: hMLH1 (P = 0.006), p16(INK4a) (P = 0.018), CDH1 (P = 0.024), and RAR-beta (P = 0.044). Our overall results suggest that in some intestinal- and diffuse-adherent-type gastric carcinomas, DNA hypermethylation affects non-specific gene promoters concordantly, at least in part, whereas in diffuse-scattered-type gastric carcinoma, DNA hypermethylation affects specific genes such as CDH1 and RAR-beta.",

There was a significant correlation between altered expression of p27 (KIP1) and p16(INK4A) (p<0.001), cyclin D1 and CDK4 (p=0.001), cyclin E and p27 (Kip1) (p=0.011) in all studied groups. In ISCC, there was significant relationship between standard clinicopathological prognostic factors and high Ki-67 index , increased cyclin D1 and cyclin E, reduced p27 (Kip1) and p21 (waf).;1) Aberrations involving p27 (KIP1), cyclin E, CDK4 and p16 (INK4A) are considered early events in HPV 16 and 18-associated cervical carcinogenesis (CINI & II), whereas cyclin D1 aberrations are late events (CINIII & ISCC) 2) Immunohistochemical tests for p16 (INK4A) and cyclin E could help in early diagnosis of cervical carcinoma 3) Only FIGO stage, cyclin D1, p27 (Kip1) and Ki-67 are independent prognostic factors that might help in predicting outcome of cervical cancer patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causative agent in a subgroup of head and neck carcinomas, particularly tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas (TSCC). This study was undertaken because controversial data exist on the physical status of HPV-DNA and the use of p16(INK4A) overexpression as surrogate HPV marker, and to examine the impact of HPV and tobacco consumption on the clinical course of TSCC. Tissue sections of 81 TSCC were analyzed by HPV 16-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and p16(INK4A)-specific immunohistochemistry. Results were correlated with clinical and demographic data. HPV 16 integration was detected by FISH as punctate signals in 33 out of 81 (41%) TSCC, 32 of which showed p16(INK4A) accumulation. Only 5 out of 48 HPV-negative tumors showed p16(INK4A) immunostaining (p < 0.0001). The presence of HPV furthermore correlates significantly with low tobacco (p = 0.002) and alcohol intake (p = 0.011), poor differentiation grade (p = 0.019), small tumor size (p = 0.024), presence of a local metastasis (p = 0.001) and a decreased (loco)regional recurrence rate (p = 0.039). Statistical analysis revealed that smoking significantly increases the risk of cancer death from TSCC and that non-smoking patients with HPV-containing TSCC show a remarkably better disease-specific survival rate. HPV 16 is integrated in 41% of TSCC and strongly correlates with p16(INK4A) overexpression, implicating the latter to be a reliable HPV biomarker. Patients with HPV-positive tumors show a favorable prognosis as compared to those with HPV-negative tumors, but tobacco use is the strongest prognostic indicator. These findings indicate that oncogenic processes in the tonsils of non-smokers differ from those occurring in smokers, the former being related to HPV 16 infection.",

We subdivided a series of these tumors into three groups, (1) classic serous, (2) mixed serous and endometrioid and (3) endometrioid carcinomas and determined: (1) the frequencies of coexisting tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, (2) frequency of a dominant ovarian mass suggesting an ovarian origin and (3) immuno-localization of WT-1, p53, PTEN, PAX2 and p16(ink4). All tumors were analyzed for p53 mutations. Thirty six, 25 and 8% of groups 1-3 were associated with tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (P=0.09) and 34, 45 and 62% predominated in one ovary (P=0.028), respectively. Differences in frequencies of diffuse p53 immunostaining (85-93%), WT-1 (70-98%) and p16(ink4) positivity (69-75%) were not significant for all groups. Greater than 95% reduction in PAX2 and PTEN occurred in 67-75 and 5-12%, respectively; however, PAX2 and PTEN staining intensity, when present, was often heterogeneous, highlighting different tumor populations. PAX2 and PTEN expression were markedly reduced or absent in 12 of 12 and 4 of 12 tubal intraepithelial carcinomas. In summary, high-grade müllerian carcinomas share identical frequencies of altered or reduced expression of p53, PTEN and PAX2, all of which can be appreciated in tubal intraepithelial carcinomas. Because only a subset of these tumors appears to arise in the fallopian tube, attention to expression of these biomarkers in the ovary and other müllerian sites might facilitate the identification of other carcinogenic pathways. PAX2 and PTEN, in addition to p53 and p16(ink4), comprise a potentially important gene combination in high-grade pelvic carcinogenesis.",

Seven BTs (3 benign, 3 borderline/atypically proliferating, 1 malignant) and 7 TCCs were stained for WT1, ER, p53, and p16(INK4a).

Once such a lesion has developed, progression toward an invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) may take one or more decades, underlining the heterogeneity of these lesions in terms of duration of existence and progression risk. We performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) on 46 p16(INK4a) immunopositive CIN2/3 lesions to determine whether this heterogeneity is reflected in their chromosomal profiles. Chromosomal profiles of CIN2/3 lesions were related to those of invasive cervical SCC and promoter methylation of CADM1, a tumor suppressor gene known to be functionally involved in the tumorigenic phenotype of cervical cancer cells. Frequent alterations found in CIN2/3 lesions included gains located at chromosome 1, 3, 7, and 20 and losses located at 4, 11, 16, 17, and 19. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified two subsets of CIN2/3 lesions, chromosomal profiles of one of which closely resembled invasive SCCs. Gains of 1, 3q, and 20 were characteristic for CIN2/3 lesions with chromosomal signatures resembling carcinomas. In addition, dense promoter methylation of the CADM1 gene was significantly more frequent in these CIN2/3 lesions (P = 0.004). No chromosomal alterations were detected in six CIN1 lesions, five of which were completely p16(INK4a) immunonegative. These findings suggest that biomarkers associated with gains at chromosomes 1, 3q, and 20 are potential hallmarks of advanced p16(INK4a)-positive CIN2/3 lesions with a high short-term risk of progression.",

In the current study, we demonstrated that over-expression of p12 in human pancreatic cancer cells led to cell arrest at the G1 phase and such cell cycle arrest was related to down-regulation of a number of oncogenes, such as c-Jun, Fos, and SEI1. Furthermore, unlike P16, P12 did not retain any cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-inhibitory activity. Instead, P12 exhibited a transactivating activity not found in P16. We also examined the genetic status of p12 in a cohort of 40 pancreatic tumor specimens and found that p12 alteration was prevalent in pancreatic tumors with an incidence of 70% (28/40).

Cyclin D1 and p16(INK4A) are expressed similarly in malignant and benign tumors (p = 0.146 and p = 0.543, respectively). None of the MEC cases showed nuclear reactivity for HPV-WS. Statistical analysis showed positive correlation between cyclin D1 and p16(INK4A) expression. Our findings suggest that p16(INK4A) overexpression is likely secondary to cyclin D1 gene upregulation or amplification. Further molecular studies are warranted.",

In order to clarify the importance of p16 alterations in melanoma, we examined the deletions of p16INK4a and expression of p16 protein in eight unselected primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines from human skin melanomas. Normal skin melanocytes were used as controls. Deletions of entire exons in the p16INK4a gene were detected by PCR technique and expression of the p16 protein was examined by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Results showed that the fragments from exons 2A, 2C and 3 in p16INK4a gene were totally deleted in the metastatic melanoma cell line, FM28.7 and the fragment from exon 3 was deleted in the metastatic melanoma cell line, FM55M2. P16 protein was strongly expressed in two of the primary melanomas cell lines (FM55P and RaH3). The p16 protein was weakly expressed in one of the metastatic melanoma cell lines (FM55M1) and negative in the other metastasis (FM55M2) as compared to their matched primary melanoma cells (FM55P). The p16 protein was strongly expressed in normal skin melanocytes. Immunocytochemistry showed that p16 protein was mainly localized in the nuclei of the melanoma cells and normal melanocytes, if it was expressed. Deletions of p16INK4a gene was uncommon and loss of p16 protein expression was common event in melanoma, especially in the later stages of melanoma.",

Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we have completed a screening test to identify gene expression changes triggered when cells proliferate under stress. In this manner, we have discovered a novel phenomenon that consists of the rapid and coordinated silencing of genes subject to imprinting, including Cdkn1c, Igf2, H19, Ndn1, Grb10, and Meg3. This generalized silencing of imprinted genes is independent of the stress-responsive tumor suppressors p53, p19(Arf), and p16(Ink4a), and it is also independent of the oxidative culture conditions and the stress response known as \"mouse embryonic fibroblast senescence\". In the case of Cdkn1c and H19, their silencing is associated with unscheduled de novo methylation of the normally expressed allele at their corresponding CpG island promoters, thus resulting in biallelic methylation. Finally, we provide evidence for frequent de novo methylation of Cdkn1c in a variety of murine cancer types. Altogether, our data support the concept that silencing of imprinted genes, including methylation of Cdkn1c, constitutes an epigenetic signature of cellular stress and tumorigenesis.",

In this study, we focused on the expression and methylation status in the regions of nt -478 to -201, containing a putative TATA box (nt -401 to -396), and nt -233 to 26, both in a recently cloned 5' upstream region of rat p16(INK4a). We showed that rat lung adenocarcinoma RLCNR did not express the p16(INK4a) gene, whereas rat osteosarcoma COS1NR and malignant fibrous histiocytoma MFH1NR both expressed it at levels similar to normal fibroblasts, even though the region of nt -233 to 26 was hypermethylated in COS1NR rather than RLCNR. In contrast, the CpG islands near the putative TATA box region were consistently methylated in RLCNR, but not in COS1NR and MFH1NR, as well as in normal fibroblasts. Treatment with 5-aza 2'-deoxycytidine induced expression of p16(INK4a) gene in RLCNR after 48 h, but no changes were observed in COS1NR and MFH1NR.

By analyzing 78 HNSCC we sought to validate the accuracy of p16(INK4A) as a reliable marker of active HPV infections in HNSCC. To this end we determined HPV DNA (HPVD) and E6*I mRNA (HPVR) expression status and correlated these results with p16(INK4A) staining. In tonsillar SCC 12/20 were HPVD+ and 12/12 of these showed active HPV infections whereas in non-tonsillar SCC 10/58 were HPVD+ and 5/10 showed active HPV infections. Thus, we prove about 8% of non-tonsillar SCC to be also correlated with HPV-associated carcinogenesis. Strikingly, 3/14 (21.4%) of tonsillar and non-tonsillar HPVD+/HPVR+ cases did not show p16(INK4A) overexpression and these cases would have been missed when applying initial p16(INK4A) staining only. However, in 13 cases negative for HPV, DNA p16(INK4A) was overexpressed. In conclusion, our data confirm tonsillar SCC to be predominantly but not only associated with active HPV infections. Furthermore, our data show that p16(INK4A) overexpression is not evident in a subgroup of HNSCC with active HPV infection. Definitive HPV data should therefore be utilized in diagnostics and treatment modalities of HPV positive and HPV negative HNSCC patients, resulting in a paradigm shift regarding these obviously different tumor entities.",

In gallbladder carcinoma, cholecystolithiasis and pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) are major risk factors. Here, by using 113 surgically resected gallbladders and cultures of human gallbladder epithelial cells (HGECs) and gallbladder carcinoma cell line (TGBC2TKB), we examined carcinogenesis with respect to cellular senescence. Among 15 cases of PBM in which carcinoma was found in 4 cases, nonneoplastic gallbladder mucosa showed diffuse papillary hyperplasia (PHP). PHP was not found in gallbladders with cholecystolithiasis. Interestingly, PHP exhibited senescent features such as expression of p16(INK4A) and low cell proliferative activity. In contrast, EZH2, a polycomb group protein, was overexpressed in intraepithelial neoplasm and carcinoma in gallbladders with cholecystolithiasis. In PBM, EZH2 was expressed only in carcinoma foci but not in PHP. Cultured HGECs treated with lysolecithin, the level of which is elevated in gallbladder bile of PBM, showed increased expression of p16(INK4A) and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. Conversely, enforced overexpression of EZH2 in senescent HGECs reduced p16(INK4A) expression. A knockdown of EZH2 in cultured TGBC2TKB cells increased p16(INK4a) expression. In conclusion, PHP in PBM may act as a barrier to malignant transformation for decades.

As the incidence of p53 mutations is significantly lower in Hodgkin's lymphoma than in other neoplasias, we investigated whether the malfunction of other proteins in this pathway could be responsible for its inactivation. Because the existence of nucleolar complexes between p14(ARF) and Hdm2 has been described as having a critical effect on p53 function by inhibiting its degradation, we analyzed the expression and subcellular localization of these proteins in 52 cases and in Hodgkin's cell lines. Two of four cell lines revealed loss of p14(ARF) expression secondary to gene promoter methylation, this being mutually exclusive with p53 mutations (1 of 4), illustrating the existence of selective pressure to inactivate the p53 pathway. The majority of Hodgkin's samples showed a strong nucleolar expression of p14(ARF) that was not associated with Hdm2. They also showed the existence of Hdm2/p53 complexes, and the absence of complexes containing either p14(ARF)/Hdm2 or p14(ARF)/p53. The different localization of Hdm2 (nucleoplasm) and p14(ARF) (nucleoli) observed in Hodgkin's tumors and cell lines is associated with the presence of short alternatively spliced transcripts of Hdm2 lacking the ARF-binding region and the nuclear export signal. The absence of these p14(ARF)/Hdm2 nucleolar complexes could be sufficient to inactivate the pathway and may explain the low frequency of p53 mutations in this tumor.",

However, the pathogenetic mechanism of the wip1 gene expression in breast carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we examine Wip1 mRNA and protein expression in 20 breast cancer tissues and six cell lines. We additionally investigate the relationship among Wip1, active p38 MAPK, p53, and p16 proteins. In our experiments, Wip1 mRNA was significantly upregulated in 7 of 20 (35%) invasive breast cancer samples. Overexpression of Wip1 was inversely correlated with that of active (phosphor-) p38 MAPK (P = 0.007). Furthermore, Wip1-overexpressing tumors exhibited no or low levels of p16, which normally accumulates upon p38 MAPK activation (P = 0.057). Loss of p16 expression was not associated with hypermethylation of its promoter or loss of heterozygosity on 9p21. Among the 135 primary breast carcinomas further examined, a significant association was found between the Wip1 overexpression and negative staining for p53 (P value = 0.057), indicating that the tumors are wild-type for p53. This is first report showing that Wip1 overexpression abrogates the homeostatic balance maintained through the p38-p53-Wip1 pathway, and contributes to malignant progression by inactivating wild-type p53 and p38 MAPK as well as decreasing p16 protein levels in human breast tissues.",

It enhances ARF-dependent and -independent p53 functions, which are central to the control of cell growth and tumor suppression in human cells. CARF interacts with ARF, p53, and MDM2 proteins, and in turn gets regulated by MDM2-mediated degradation, suggesting a self-regulatory loop. CARF is upregulated during replicative, oncogenic, and stress-induced senescence. Overexpression of CARF induced premature senescence in normal human fibroblasts that was mediated by upregulation of p53-p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p16(INK4a)- pRB pathways. Knockdown of CARF resulted in mitotic arrest leading to excessive chromosomal condensation, aneuploidy, and apoptosis, suggesting that CARF is essential for cell survival. Most recently, we have found that CARF causes bidirectional regulation of p53 and pRB pathways, either arresting or promoting growth, and thus, it could be a potential threshold link between aging and cancer.",

These variant HMECs, which contain hypermethylated and silenced p16(INK4a) (p16) promoters, eventually accumulate multiple chromosomal changes, many of which are similar to those detected in premalignant and malignant lesions of breast cancer. To determine the origin of these variant HMECs in culture, we used Luria-Delbrück fluctuation analysis and found that variant HMECs exist within the population before the proliferation barrier, thereby raising the possibility that variant HMECs exist in vivo before cultivation. To test this hypothesis, we examined mammary tissue from normal women for evidence of p16 promoter hypermethylation.

Nonetheless, it has remained unclear whether an epimutation (an aberrant change in epigenetic regulation) can induce tumorigenesis. Here, we exploited a functionally validated cis-acting regulatory element and devised a strategy to induce developmentally regulated genomic targeting of DNA methylation. We used this system to target DNA methylation within the p16(Ink4a) promoter in mice in vivo. Engineered p16(Ink4a) promoter hypermethylation led to transcriptional suppression in somatic tissues during aging and increased the incidence of spontaneous cancers in these mice. Further, mice carrying a germline p16(Ink4a) mutation in one allele and a somatic epimutation in the other had accelerated tumor onset and substantially shortened tumor-free survival. Taken together, these results provide direct functional evidence that p16(Ink4a) epimutation drives tumor formation and malignant progression and validate a targeted methylation approach to epigenetic engineering.",

The etiology of primary endometrial squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), however, is speculative. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of p14, p16, p53, cyclin D1, steroid hormone receptors, and human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection in the pathogenesis of primary endometrial squamous cell carcinoma. The expression of p16, p14, p53, cyclin D1, and steroid hormone receptors (estrogen, progesterone, and androgen) was examined immunohistochemically in 8 primary ESCCs. HPV analysis was performed using general primers and HPV typing. The median age of the patients was 62.1 years. Four cases showed positive nuclear and cytoplasmic p16 staining in an insular pattern, and 1 case nuclear positivity for p53 and estrogen receptors, respectively. Four of 8 cases were positive for progesterone receptor analysis and cyclin D1. All cases were negative for p14 and androgen receptor staining. All but one case were negative for HPV analysis. Five patients were alive with and without evidence of disease after a mean follow-up of 6.1 years. The results of this study suggest that alterations of the p16 pathway may play an etiologic role in at least a proportion of the ESCC, but without any association to HPV infection. Factors known to play a pathogenetic role in types 1 and 2 of endometrial carcinomas are not associated with primary ESCC. However, prognostically, ESCCs are more related to type 1 cancers.",

Ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a risk factor for the development of GBM. In this study, we systematically examined the contribution of IR-induced DSBs to GBM development using transgenic mouse models harboring brain-targeted deletions of key tumor suppressors frequently lost in GBM, namely Ink4a, Ink4b, Arf and/or PTEN. Using low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to generate simple breaks or high LET HZE particles (Fe ions) to generate complex breaks, we found that DSBs induce high-grade gliomas in these mice which, otherwise, do not develop gliomas spontaneously. Loss of Ink4a and Arf was sufficient to trigger IR-induced glioma development but additional loss of Ink4b significantly increased tumor incidence. We analyzed IR-induced tumors for copy number alterations to identify oncogenic changes that were generated and selected for as a consequence of stochastic DSB events. We found Met amplification to be the most significant oncogenic event in these radiation-induced gliomas. Importantly, Met activation resulted in the expression of Sox2, a GBM cancer stem cell marker, and was obligatory for tumor formation. In sum, these results indicate that radiation-induced DSBs cooperate with loss of Ink4 and Arf tumor suppressors to generate high-grade gliomas that are commonly driven by Met amplification and activation.

Less commonly described is the observation of p16 overexpression in SCCHN. Since overexpression of p16 is a potent predictor of outcome in other cancers, we were interested in determining the level of expression of p16 in our SCCHN specimens as a prerequisite to later prognostic studies. We were also interested in determining the mutational status of p16 in these tumors, in order to determine whether the combination of overexpression and gene alteration may predict a different clinical outcome from overexpression alone. A total of 84 specimens of SCCHN were selected for study. These specimens were obtained from all major sites within the oral cavity, oropharynx, pharynx and larynx. The level of expression of p16 in SCCHN specimens was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In 35 cases, RNA was also isolated from matched normal tissue obtained from a negative tumor margin. In the other 49 cases, the expression level was compared with the level of expression measured in pooled normal RNA obtained from 10 specimens of normal epithelial tissue. Overexpression of p16 was documented when the level of expression in the tumor specimen was 2-fold or greater above the level of expression found in normal tissue. A total of 46 specimens demonstrated overexpression of p16 (55%). All specimens demonstrating overexpression were then subject to sequence analysis. Thirty specimens (65%) showed p16-specific gene alterations, ranging from intragenic deletions to single point mutations, and 15 of these cases concomitantly affect p14ARF. A single specimen demonstrated a silent point mutation within the p16 reading frame. This mutation produces a stop codon at residue 85 in the context of the p14ARF reading frame, predicting premature termination of p14ARF within a previously determined nucleolar localization signal. This observation suggests that in some cases at least, p14ARF may be a selective target for alteration, independently of p16. Analysis of a normal tissue specimen obtained from a negative tumor margin, and a blood sample obtained approximately five years after surgery indicate that this p14ARF-specific alteration may represent a germline mutation.",

Having demonstrated previously that the homeodomain transcription factor Cdx2 increases markedly during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, we have examined its effects in beta-catenin signaling during transdifferentiation of Em Ca cells. In clinical cases, Cdx2 immunoreactivity, along with increased mRNA signals, was found to overlap with nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and p21(Waf1) in morules, demonstrating an inverse correlation with cell proliferation. In cell lines, over-expression of active form beta-catenin resulted in a significant increase in endogenous Cdx2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the Cdx2 promoter was activated by T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) -independent activated beta-catenin, as well as Cdx2 itself, through the region from -39 to +9 bp relative to transcription start site. Cells over-expressing exogenous Cdx2 showed high levels of p21(Waf1) expression due to stabilization of the mRNA status, resulting in significant decrease in the proliferation rate, in contrast to the lack of apparent changes in morphology. Moreover, transfected Cdx2 could inhibit beta-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcriptional activation of target genes, including p14(ARF) and cyclin D1, probably through indirect mechanisms. These data suggest that over-expression of Cdx2 mediated by nuclear beta-catenin and Cdx2 itself can cause an inhibition of Em Ca cell proliferation through up-regulation of p21(Waf1) expression, modulating beta-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcription. We therefore conclude that an association between Cdx2 and beta-catenin signaling may participate in induction of transdifferentiation of Em Ca cells.",

The relationships between senescence and immune infiltrates have not previously been studied in humans. We explore whether a marker of senescence (p16(ink4a)) in combination with low level expression of a proliferation marker (ki-67) relate to T cell infiltrates in CRC, and whether p16(ink4a), Ki-67 and immune infiltrates have similar prognostic value.;Immunostaining of p16(inka) and Ki-67 was performed within a CRC tissue microarray. Nuclear p16(inka) and Ki-67 were categorised as high/low.

High nuclear p16(ink4a) was expressed in 63% and high proliferation (Ki-67 >15%) in 61%. p16(ink4a) expression was associated with reduced CD45RO+ cells at the IM (P<0.05) and within the stroma (P<0.05) and reduced CD8+ cells at the IM (P<0.01).

GASC1 is a histone demethylase involved in the deregulation of histone methylation in cancer cells. In the current study, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the genes in the 9p24 amplicon in human breast cancer. We performed extensive genomic analyses on a panel of cancer cell lines and narrowed the shortest region of overlap to approximately 2 Mb. Based on statistical analysis of copy number increase and overexpression, the 9p24 amplicon contains six candidate oncogenes. Among these, four genes (GASC1 UHRF2, KIAA1432 and C9orf123) are overexpressed only in the context of gene amplification while two genes (ERMP1 and IL33) are overexpressed independent of the copy number increase. We then focused our studies on the UHRF2 gene, which has a potential involvement in both DNA methylation and histone modification. Knocking down UHRF2 expression inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells specifically with 9p24 amplification. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of UHRF2 in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells promoted cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UHRF2 has the ability to suppress the expression of key cell-cycle inhibitors, such as p16(INK4a), p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Taken together, our studies support the notion that the 9p24 amplicon contains multiple oncogenes that may integrate genetic and epigenetic codes and have important roles in human tumorigenesis.",

One group includes the p21 (CIP1, WAF1, CAP20), p27 (Kip1), and p57 (Kip2) CDKIs, which contain a homologous amino-terminal cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitory domain. The p16 (INK4A), p15 (INK4B), and p18 (INK4C) CDKIs, which have an ankyrin repeat motifs, belong to the other group. The p16 and p15 CDKI genes are very frequently altered in a variety of cancers including hematopoietic malignancies. The p19 (INK4D) gene is a newly cloned CDKI which belongs to the latter group. To determine if p19 genetic alterations play a role in hematopoietic malignancies, we examined DNA from 45 childhood newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALLs), 30 acute myeloblastic leukemias (AMLs), 10 chronic myelocytic leukemias (CMLs), 45 adult T cell leukemias (ATLs), 70 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), and 20 multiple myelomas (MM) as well as 14 ALL, 20 AML, two ATL, and five lymphoma cell lines. Using Southern blot analysis, one homozygous deletion of the p19 gene was detected in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related Burkitt-like lymphoma sample. No point mutations in any of the samples were found by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis.

To understand the role of miRNAs in this molecular complexity, we performed miRNA expression analysis in a cohort of molecularly well-characterized human breast cancer cell lines to identify miRNAs associated with the most common molecular subtypes and the most frequent genetic aberrations.;Using a microarray carrying LNA™ modified oligonucleotide capture probes), expression levels of 725 human miRNAs were measured in 51 breast cancer cell lines. Differential miRNA expression was explored by unsupervised cluster analysis and was then associated with the molecular subtypes and genetic aberrations commonly present in breast cancer.;Unsupervised cluster analysis using the most variably expressed miRNAs divided the 51 breast cancer cell lines into a major and a minor cluster predominantly mirroring the luminal and basal intrinsic subdivision of breast cancer cell lines. One hundred and thirteen miRNAs were differentially expressed between these two main clusters. Forty miRNAs were differentially expressed between basal-like and normal-like/claudin-low cell lines. Within the luminal-group, 39 miRNAs were associated with ERBB2 overexpression and 24 with E-cadherin gene mutations, which are frequent in this subtype of breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, 31 miRNAs were associated with E-cadherin promoter hypermethylation, which, contrary to E-cadherin mutation, is exclusively observed in breast cancer cell lines that are not of luminal origin. Thirty miRNAs were associated with p16INK4 status while only a few miRNAs were associated with BRCA1, PIK3CA/PTEN and TP53 mutation status. Twelve miRNAs were associated with DNA copy number variation of the respective locus.;Luminal-basal and epithelial-mesenchymal associated miRNAs determine the subdivision of miRNA transcriptome of breast cancer cell lines. Specific sets of miRNAs were associated with ERBB2 overexpression, p16INK4a or E-cadherin mutation or E-cadherin methylation status, which implies that these miRNAs may contribute to the driver role of these genetic aberrations. Additionally, miRNAs, which are located in a genomic region showing recurrent genetic aberrations, may themselves play a driver role in breast carcinogenesis or contribute to a driver gene in their vicinity. In short, our study provides detailed molecular miRNA portraits of breast cancer cell lines, which can be exploited for functional studies of clinically important miRNAs.",

Here, we propose that galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding lectin, regulates premature senescence without oncogenic stress. We detected premature senescence, decreased Skp2, and increased p27(KIP1) expression in galectin-3 knockout MEFs and galectin-3-depleted gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, galectin-3 depletion did not affect other senescence inducers such as p14(ARF), p16(INK4A), and p21(WAF1/CIP1), suggesting that galectin-3-regulated senescence is p27(KIP1) dependent. We demonstrate that galectin-3 depletion decreases retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation (Ser780, Ser807/811), cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression, and E2F1 transcriptional activation. Galectin-3 directly interacts with the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex and promotes hyperphosphorylation of Rb. It also blocks the inhibition of E2F1 transcription, thereby increasing the expression of Skp2 and reducing the stability of p27(KIP1) to promote the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Xenograft mice with galectin-3-depleted gastric cancer cells display tumor growth retardation that is reversed by Skp2 overexpression. Increased expression of galectin-3 is also associated with the advanced TNM (tumor, lymph node, metastasis) system, clinicopathological stage, and lymph node metastases. The probability of survival was significantly decreased in gastric cancer patients with galectin-3(high) p27(KIP1-low)cells. Taken together, our results show that galectin-3 may accelerate gastric tumorigenesis by inhibiting premature senescence. ",

DNA promoter methylation frequencies in HCC and matching non-malignant cirrhotic liver, respectively, were as follows: p16(INK4a) (76% vs. 24%), GSTP1 (53% vs. 32%), MGMT (6 vs. 12%), DAP-K (68 vs. 100%) and APC (100 vs. 100%). GSTP1 and/or p16(INK4a) promoter methylation was observed in 88% of the HCC samples. In normal liver tissue, the p16(INK4a), GSTP1 and MGMT promoter were not methylated. DAP-K was methylated in 31% and APC even in 100% of normal liver samples. Quantitative levels of methylated promoter DNA of all genes were significantly different in the various tissue types except for MGMT. Our results suggest that promoter methylation of tumor-associated genes is a common event in hepatocarcinogenesis. Significantly, higher levels and frequencies of promoter methylation in HCC were found for p16(INK4a) and GSTP1 compared to non-malignant cirrhotic liver. This indicates that these epigenetic events may serve as a good marker for HCC. These data also demonstrate the importance of the quantification of methylated promoter DNA within a given sample and the use of normal tissue as controls. Quantitative analyses of methylated GSTP1 and p16(INK4a) promoter may serve as a powerful molecular marker in detecting HCC in biopsies.",

This consideration is supported by the observation of multiple allelic losses in the coding loci of chromosome 9p21 in squamous cell carcinomas and in dysplastic premalignant lesions. The present study hypothesized that comparable alterations already occur in leukoplakia, which are seen as potential predecessors of oral squamous cell carcinomas and that it is possible to differ leukoplakia with from leukoplakia without further malignant transformation. Furthermore we evaluated, whether such leukoplakia show sequence alterations in the genes p16 and p14ARF, which are capable to cause a limitation in gene function. The results show that the LOH pattern in genes p16 and p14ARF occur as well in leuplakia with malignant transformation as in leukoplakia, that do not show clinical alterations. The rate of allelic loss did not differ significantly. Overall, the incidence of allelic loss was lower in leuplakia compared to succeeding squamous-cell carcinomas (p<0,05). The results further illustrated an increase in LOH patterns in dyplastic leukoplakia, without reaching statistical significance. Significant increases in allelic losses were found in heavy smokers, (p < 0,05). PCR analysis of the exons 1-alpha, exon 1-beta and exon 2 in leukoplakia, containing LOH patterns did not show genetic alterations. Thus we concluded, that gene deletion and gene mutation have a minor role in the inactivation process of p16 and p14ARF in oral leukoplakia. Representing an early process in carcinogenesis, gene deletion and mutation occur in leukoplakia with and without malignant transformation. Therefore, taken as a singular parameter they represent an uncertain criteria to assess the potential of malignant transformation.

Therefore, it became clear that efficient therapeutic regimens should also take into account the presence of these supportive cells and inhibit their paracrine effects. To this end, we tested the effect of low concentrations of curcumin, a pharmacologically safe natural product, on patient-derived primary breast CAF cells. We have shown that curcumin treatment upregulates p16(INK4A) and other tumor suppressor proteins while inactivates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. This reduced the level of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and the migration/invasion abilities of these cells. Furthermore, curcumin suppressed the expression/secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and transforming growth factor-β, which impeded their paracrine procarcinogenic potential. Intriguingly, these effects were sustained even after curcumin withdrawal and cell splitting. Therefore, using different markers of senescence [senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, Ki-67 and Lamin B1 levels, and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation], we have shown that curcumin markedly suppresses Lamin B1 and triggers DNA damage-independent senescence in proliferating but not quiescent breast stromal fibroblasts. Importantly, this curcumin-related senescence was p16(INK4A)-dependent and occurred with no associated inflammatory secretory phenotype. These results indicate the possible inactivation of cancer-associated myofibroblasts and present the first indication that curcumin can trigger DNA damage-independent and safe senescence in stromal fibroblasts.",

None of the normal specimens showed TP16 gene deletion. Data obtained from FISH highly correlated with the PCR results for the identification of TP16 MTS1/CDK41 gene deletions. Patients with deletion of the TP16 MTS1/CDK41 gene show a greater tendency toward the development of recurrence and metastasis.",

Understanding the relationship between mutant p53 and hypermethylation of other tumor suppressor genes is essential when elucidate mechanisms of tumor development. In this study, two isogenic human B lymphoblast cell lines with different p53 status include TK6 containing wild-type p53 and WTK1 with mutant p53 were used and contrasted. Lower levels of p16(ink4A) protein were detected in WTK1 cells than in TK6 cells, which were accompanied by increased DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) gene expression as well as hypermethylation of the p16 ( ink4A ) promoter. siRNA experiments to transiently knock down wild-type p53 in TK6 cells resulted in increase of DNMT1 expression as well as decrease of p16(ink4A) protein. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of mutant p53 in WTK1 cells did not alter either DNMT1 or p16(ink4A) protein levels. Furthermore, loss of suppression function of mutant p53 to DNMT1 in WTK1 was caused by the attenuation of its binding ability to the DNMT1 promoter. In summary, we provide evidences to elucidate the relationship between mutant p53 and DNMT1. Our results indicate that mutant p53 loses its ability to suppress DNMT1 expression, and thus enhances methylation levels of the p16 ( ink4A ) promoter and subsequently down-regulates p16(ink4A )protein.",

The future numbers of patients with vulvar SCC is expected to rise, mainly because of the proportional increase in the average age of the general population. Two different pathways for vulvar SCC have been put forth. The first pathway is triggered by infection with a high-risk-type Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Integration of the HPV DNA into the host genome leads to the development of a typical vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), accompanied with overexpression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A). This lesion subsequently forms a warty- or basaloid-type SCC. The HPV vaccine is a promising new tool for prevention of this HPV related SCC of the vulva. The second pathway is HPV-independent. Keratinizing SCC develops within a background of lichen sclerosus (LS) through a differentiated VIN. It has a different set of genetic alterations than those in the first pathway, including p53 mutations, allelic imbalances (AI), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Further clinical and basic research is still required to understand and prevent vulvar SCC. Capsule. Two pathway for pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of the value are reviewed.",

Hybrid fish can spontaneously develop melanomas deriving from the inheritance of melanistic pigment patterns and the simultaneous absence of proper genetic regulation. A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene, termed CDKN2X, was mapped to a genomic region that is implicated in fish melanoma tumor suppression. The related human tumor suppressor locus CDKN2A (P16, INK4A, MTS1) is deleted, mutated or transcriptionally repressed through methylation of cytosine bases within the 5' CpG island in a variety of neoplasms, including melanoma. The fish CDKN2X locus harbors a CpG island within its promoter and first exon, analogous in location to CpG islands in human CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci. The methylation state of individual CpG dinucleotides was investigated in genomic DNA derived from control tissues and melanomas within the CDKN2X 5' CpG island. The studied genomic area was found to be virtually unmethylated in all tested tissues including melanomas. In addition, RNA expression studies of the fish CDKN2X locus revealed that it is significantly overexpressed in melanoma, in contrast to what has been reported for the human CDKN2A locus in melanoma. Such overexpression may be a consequence of the pronounced upregulation of the Xmrk-2 receptor tyrosine kinase oncogene reported in several Xiphophorus melanoma models.",

Recently, the CDKN2 gene (p16INK4A, MTS I, CDK41) has been proposed as a candidate tumor suppressor gene because it is frequently deleted in cell lines derived from multiple tumor types. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with interphase cells using yeast artificial chromosome clones and a cosmid contig of the CDKN2 region. In 10 cell lines (4 glioma, 2 melanoma, 2 non-small cell lung cancer, 2 bladder cancer) with 9p alterations detected by molecular or cytogenetic analysis, interphase FISH with the CDKN2 cosmid contig detected all 9p deletions previously identified by molecular analysis. Using this probe, FISH analysis of primary glioblastoma tumors revealed homozygous deletions of the CDKN2 region in 6 of 9 tumors (67%) whereas a yeast artificial chromosome probe containing the interferon type I (IFN) gene cluster was deleted in only 4 cases (44%). Thus, it is likely that the CDKN2 region is the target of 9p deletions in gliomas. Interphase FISH will play an important role in defining the clinical significance of 9p deletions in primary tumors because it is especially applicable to clinical samples which may be contaminated by normal cells.",

Five different germline mutations in CDKN2 were found in six families. Three of the mutations (Met53Ile, Arg24Pro and 23ins24) have been reported previously. We have identified two novel CDKN2 mutations (88delG and Ala118Thr) which are likely to be associated with the development of melanoma, because of their co-segregation with the disease and their likely functional effect on the CDKN2 protein. In binding assays the protein expressed from the previously described mutation, Met53Ile, did not bind to CDK4/CDK6, confirming its role as a causal mutation in the development of melanoma. Ala118Thr appeared to be functional in this assay. Arg24Pro appeared to bind to CDK6, but not to CDK4. No mutations were detected in exon 2 of CDK4, suggesting that causal mutations in this gene are uncommon.

Recent studies of colorectal and gastric carcinomas have defined a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), which involves the targeting of multiple genes by promoter hypermethylation. In this study, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to study methylation of CpG islands in the promoters of the p16(INK4a), cadherin 1 (CDH1), and retinoic acid receptor-beta (RAR-beta) genes in 45 gastric carcinomas and to investigate whether CDH1 and RAR-beta promoter hypermethylation is associated with CIMP-positive gastric carcinoma. CpG island hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a), CDH1, and RAR-beta promoters was detected in 12 (27%), 26 (58%), and 24 (53%) of the 45 gastric carcinomas, respectively. Hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a) promoter was more common in intestinal type than in diffuse type gastric carcinomas (p = 0.0023; Fisher's exact test) and was inversely associated with p53 mutations (p = 0.0225; Fisher's exact test). However, CDH1 and RAR-beta promoter hypermethylation was observed more frequently in diffuse-scattered type gastric carcinoma than in other types (intestinal and diffuse-adherent types) (p = 0.0175 and p = 0.0335, respectively; Fisher's exact test) and was not associated with p53 mutation status. Moreover, hypermethylation of the CDH1 and RAR-beta promoters occurred concordantly (p < 0.0001; Fisher's exact test).

We isolated several clones that stably expressed various amounts of p16 protein. The doubling time of the various clones was generally prolonged. Clones with high-level expression of p16 protein had characteristics of restricted growth, such as contact inhibition, while the parental T98G cells had no such characteristics.

Oncoprotein MDM2 plays a primary role in regulating P53, and these two form an automregulatory feedback loop. mdm2/p53 passway performs important function in development, progression,therapy and prognosis of breast cancer. Besides, more and more studies show that some other molecular markers in breast cancer, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, p14ARF, and Her2/neu can regulate this passway unneglectedly. The purpose of this review is to summarize not only the relations between mdm2/p53 passway and pathological characters, therapy and prognosis of breast cancer, but also the relations of this passway with some other molecular proteins in breast cancer.",

The phosphorylase is a housekeeping enzyme involved in the purine and amino acid metabolism whose activity is evidentiable in all the normal tissues. Chromosomal deletions encompassing both MTAPase and p16INK4 genes cause the total absence of the enzymatic activity only in malignant cells, thus resulting in defined metabolic differences between malignant and normal cells. MTAPase deficiency was investigated by direct radiochemical assay method and by immunochemical techniques in 35 different human malignant cell lines established from several tumor types. The enzyme-deficient cells derived from breast, lung, ovary and liver cancer, malignant melanomas, malignant gliomas and liposarcomas. Two of the MTAPase-deficient cell preparations (from a liver carcinoma and from a melanoma) are primary cultures thus directly representing the original cancer genotypes. Several of the MTAPase-negative cells were studied for p16INK4 gene deletions and for p16INK4 protein deficiency. In all the examined samples a full correlation exists between the lack of MTAPase and that of p16INK4. A similar result was obtained analysing extracts of Vero cell line, which is a fibroblast MTAPase-negative cell line established from the kidney of a normal adult monkey. Conversely, Cos cells, which also are fibroblasts derived from monkey kidney, show both MTAPase and p16INK4 protein. These results: (i) demonstrate that the phosphorylase deficiency is distributed among almost all the most important human cancers; (ii) confirm and extend the tumor types were p16INK4 gene inactivation is observable and (iii) suggest that deletions at 9p21 (in humans) or at syntenic chromosomes (in other species) might represent a general mechanism of p16INK4 gene loss of function and possibly, in turn, of cancer development and/or progression.",

P16(INK4A) is often used as a surrogate marker for HPV-infection, although there is still controversy with respect its reliability. Our aim was to determine if p16(INK4A) overexpression can accurately predict both high-risk and low-risk-HPV-presence in (pre)malignant and benign head and neck lesions. P16(INK4A) immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 162 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC), 14 tonsillar and 23 laryngeal dysplasias, and 20 tonsillar and 27 laryngeal papillomas. PCR, enzyme-immunoassay and FISH analysis were used to assess HPV-presence and type. Of the 162 OPSCC and 14 tonsillar dysplasias, 51 (31%) and 10 (71%) were HPV16-positive, respectively. All tonsillar papillomas were HPV-negative and four laryngeal dysplasias and 26 laryngeal papillomas were positive for HPV6 or -11. P16(INK4A) immunohistochemistry revealed a strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in 50 out of 51 HPV16-positive and 5 out of 111 HPV-negative OPSCC (p < 0.0001) and in all HPV16-positive tonsillar dysplasias, whereas highly variable staining patterns were detected in the papillomas and laryngeal dysplasias, irrespective of the HPV-status. In addition, the latter lesions generally showed a higher nuclear than cytoplasmic p16(INK4A) immunostaining intensity. In conclusion, our data show that strong nuclear and cytoplasmic p16(INK4A) overexpression is a reliable surrogate indicator for HPV16 in OPSCC and (adjacent) dysplasias. For HPV6 or -11-positive and HPV-negative benign and premalignant lesions of the tonsil and larynx, however, p16(INK4A) immunostaining is highly variable and cannot be recommended to predict HPV-presence.",

In contrast, little is known about the function(s) of exon 2 of ARF, which contains the majority of mutations in human cancer. In addition to controlling TP53 stability, ARF also has a role in the induction of autophagy. However, whether the principal molecule involved is full-length ARF, or a small molecular weight variant called smARF, has been controversial. Additionally, whether tumor-derived mutations in exon 2 of CDKN2A affect ARF's autophagy function is unknown. Finally, whereas it is known that silencing or inhibiting TP53 induces autophagy, the contribution of ARF to this induction is unknown. In this report we used multiple autophagy assays to map a region located in the highly conserved 5' end of exon 2 of CDKN2A that is necessary for autophagy induction by both human and murine ARF. We showed that mutations in exon 2 of CDKN2A that affect the coding potential of ARF, but not p16INK4a, all impair the ability of ARF to induce autophagy. We showed that whereas full-length ARF can induce autophagy, our combined data suggest that smARF instead induces mitophagy (selective autophagy of mitochondria), thus potentially resolving some confusion regarding the role of these variants. Finally, we showed that silencing Tp53 induces autophagy in an ARF-dependent manner. Our data indicated that a conserved domain in ARF mediates autophagy, and for the first time they implicate autophagy in ARF's tumor suppressor function. ",

The first aim of our study was to determine whether the level of promoter methylation is elevated in the normal colonic mucosa of patients with CIMP+ tumours.

In genetic studies, BCC patients have cell-cycle abnormalities of different parts of the signaling pathway. Retinoblastoma regulatory pathway is important in cell cycle arrest. In this pathway, p16INK4a, an inhibitor of Rb pathway, binds to CDK4 and CDK6 competitively with cyclin D1 to prevent phosphorylation of tumor suppressor pRB gene. Alteration of this pathway contributes to development of human cancers and also is effective in skin cancers. In this study, we analyzed mRNA expression using in situ RT-PCR and the role of immunohistochemical expression of p16INK4a in BCC.;Expression of p16 in ten samples of Iranian paraffin-embedded skin BCC were studied using in situ RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on p16INK4a gene.;Nuclear and cytoplasmic staining intensity of samples within tumor cells and normal skin tissue illustrates different mRNA and protein expression of p16 gene. mRNA of p16 gene and the expressed protein induce cell cycle proliferation and involve both tumor tissue as well as normal skin tissue. However, in this study it was found that there is significant protein and mRNA expression in BCC cells when compared to normal skin tissue (p<0.05).;p16 gene is involved in the pathogenesis of human skin BCC in view of increased p16 mRNA and expressed protein within tumor cells.",

In a search for biomarkers of malignant progression, we analyzed the expression of the tumor suppressor gene Rb and of the proteins regulating its phosphorylation and function in G1 arrest, p16INK4A and cyclin D1, in preinvasive bronchial lesions accompanying cancer in 75 patients, in comparison with similar lesions in 22 patients with no cancer history. Rb was constantly expressed in preinvasive lesions, including carcinoma in situ (CIS). In contrast, p16 expression was lost in moderate dysplasia (12%) and in CIS (30%) in patients with lung cancer. p16 loss occurred exclusively in patients who displayed loss of p16 expression in their related invasive carcinoma. Loss of p16 expression was not seen in nine patients with dysplasia but no cancer progression. Cyclin D1 overexpression was seen in hyperplasia and metaplasia (6%), mild dysplasia (17%), moderate dysplasia (46%), and CIS (38%) in patients with cancer but was lost in 5% of the patients during the process of invasion; it was also observed in patients with no cancer progression (14%). Our results indicate that Rb protein function can be invalidated before invasion through alteration of the Rb phosphorylation pathway, by p16 inhibition, and/or by cyclin D1 overexpression and suggest a role for p16 and cyclin D1 deregulation in progression of preinvasive bronchial lesions to invasive carcinoma.",

Under normal conditions, MIR31HG is found in both nucleus and cytoplasm, but following B-RAF expression MIR31HG is located mainly in the cytoplasm. We show that MIR31HG interacts with both INK4A and MIR31HG genomic regions and with Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, and that MIR31HG is required for PcG-mediated repression of the INK4A locus. We further identify a functional enhancer, located between MIR31HG and INK4A, which becomes activated during OIS and interacts with the MIR31HG promoter. Data from melanoma patients show a negative correlation between MIR31HG and p16(INK4A) expression levels, suggesting a role for this transcript in cancer.

One hundred NSCLC tumors from patients undergoing definitive thoracotomies at a single institution were examined for p16INK4a and retinoblastoma protein (pRB) expression. Abnormal pRB staining was identified in 15% of the tumors, whereas 51% possessed aberrant p16INK4a protein expression. Tumors with aberrant expression of p16INK4a by immunohistochemistry were associated with a significantly worse survival (P=0.04). Additionally, the inverse correlation of pRB and p16INK4a expression previously noted in lung cancer cell lines and tumors was confirmed in this large cohort of patients, with 65% of the tumors demonstrating inverse expression of pRB and p16INK4a (p=0.00019). A statistically significant increase in aberrant p16INK4a expression, as well as inverse expression of p16INK4a and pRB, was seen with increasing pathological stage of disease.

Loss of E-cadherin expression occurs in various human tumors and is the first step in cancer invasion and metastasis. We demonstrate that the exogenous expression of E-cadherin transfected into G-415 GB cells not only increases cell-to-cell adhesion but also reduces in vitro cell proliferation, motility and invasion. Our aim was to determine what genes are most affected by the exogenous expression of E-cadherin in GB cancer cells. We analyzed gene expression pertaining to cell proliferation, motility and invasion. Conventional RT-PCR was performed for these genes; quantitative RT-PCR was carried out on genes exhibiting altered expression. Conventional RT-PCR revealed that E-cadherin transfection suppressed expression of mts1 mRNA and increased that of c-myc and MT1-MMP. In quantitative RT-PCR analysis, levels of c-myc and MT1-MMP mRNA were elevated by to 2.56- and 2.22-fold, respectively, in the E-cadherin transfectant, whereas mts-1 was 7.14-fold suppressed compared to parental cells. These results indicated that expression of mts1 mRNA was most affected by E-cadherin transfection. Immunocytochemical analysis of transfectant and parental cells demonstrated an inverse correlation in E-cadherin and mts1 expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of 37 GB cancer specimens confirmed this observation in vivo.

Expression analysis of ANRIL, EZH2, SUZ12, EED, JARID2, CBX7, BMI1, p16, p15, and p14/ARF genes was evaluated in a large cohort of invasive breast carcinomas (IBC, n = 456) by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on CBX7, EZH2, p14, p15, p16, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac. We observed significant overexpression in IBCs of ANRIL (19.7%) and EZH2 (77.0%) and an underexpression of CBX7 (39.7%). Correlations were identified between these genes, their expression patterns, and several classical clinical and pathologic parameters, molecular subtypes, and patient outcomes, as well as with proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and breast cancer stem cell markers. Multivariate analysis revealed that combined EZH2/CBX7 status is an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.001).

Thus, we investigated the role of p16(ink4a) immunostaining as another adjunct test to diagnose cervical neoplasia in equivocal liquid based cytology. Eighty-seven patients were randomly selected for this study (3 patients with normal, 84 patients with abnormal including 24 ASCUS, 30 LSIL, and 30 HSIL). We performed p16(ink4a) immunostaining on ThinPrep slide and on each case from the corresponding cervical biopsy tissues. High-risk HPV-DNA testing was also performed on all the subjects. We found that the immunoreactivity of p16(ink4a) is strongly correlated with the grade of cytologic and histologic diagnoses as well as with Hybrid Capture 2. In comparing the p16(ink4a) immunostaining with the Hybrid Capture 2 for accuracy of the diagnosis of CIN II/III or a higher-grade disease in the case of ASCUS/LSIL on ThinPrep, no significant differences were observed. Our data implies that p16(ink4a) immunocytochemical staining in liquid-based cytology specimens might be used as a good adjunct test to predict cervical histology in equivocal ThinPrep tests.",

AAV2-induced death occurred via targeting pathways of apoptosis and necrosis. In contrast, normal human mammary epithelial cells were unaffected upon AAV2 infection. The current study characterizes AAV2 infection and subsequent death of the highly aggressive, triple-negative (ER(-)/PR(-)/HER2(-)) MDA-MB-435 cell line derived from metastatic human breast carcinoma. Monolayer MDA-MB-435 cultures infected with AAV2 underwent complete apoptotic cell death characterized by activation of caspases -7, -8, and -9 and PARP cleavage. Death was further correlated with active AAV2 genome replication and differential expression of viral non-structural proteins Rep78 and Rep52. Cell death coincided with increased entry into S and G 2 phases, upregulated expression of the proliferation markers Ki-67 and the monomeric form of c-Myc. Expression of the p16(INK4), p27(KIP1), p21(WAF1), and p53 tumor suppressors was downregulated, indicating marked S phase progression, but sharply contrasted with hypo-phosphorylated pRb. In parallel, MDA-MB-435 breast tumor xenografts which received intratumoral injections of AAV2 were growth retarded, displayed extensive areas of necrosis, and stained positively for c-Myc as well as cleaved caspase-8. Therefore, AAV2 induced death of MDA-MB-435 xenografts was modulated through activation of caspase-regulated death pathways in relation to signals for cell cycle controls. Our findings provide foundational studies for development of novel AAV2 based therapeutics for treating aggressive, triple-negative breast cancer types. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cytological screening for cervical cancer or its precursors using Papanicolaou's smear test (Pap test) has been highly efficient to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cervical cancer. However, evaluation of the Pap test relies on subjective diagnostic parameters and is affected by a high rate of false-positive and false-negative results. More objective diagnostic parameters to identify truly dysplastic or neoplastic cells in cervical smears as well as in cervical biopsy samples would therefore avoid insecurity for many patients and the high screening costs associated with repeated testing. Cervical dysplasia is induced by persistent infections through high-risk types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Outgrowth of dysplastic lesions is triggered by increasing expression of two viral oncogenes, E6 and E7, which both interact with various cell cycle-regulating proteins. Among these is the retinoblastoma gene product pRB, which is inactivated by E7. pRB inhibits transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene p16(INK4a). Increasing expression of the viral oncogenes in dysplastic cervical cells might thus be reflected by increased expression of p16(INK4a). In line with this hypothesis, we observed marked overexpression of p16(INK4a) in all cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN) I lesions (n = 47) except those associated with low-risk HPV types (n = 7), all CIN II lesions (n = 32), all CIN III lesions (n = 60) and 58 of 60 invasive cervical cancers. In contrast, no detectable expression of p16(INK4a) was observed in normal cervical epithelium (n = 42), inflammatory lesions (n = 48) and low-grade cervical lesions (CIN I) associated with low-risk HPV types (n = 7). Dysplastic cells could also be identified in cervical smears using a specific p16(INK4a) monoclonal antibody. These data demonstrate that p16(INK4a) is a specific biomarker to identify dysplastic cervical epithelia in sections of cervical biopsy samples or cervical smears.",

Approaches to improving cervical cancer screening and diagnostic methodologies include molecular biological analysis, targeting of biomarker proteins, but also exploration and implementation of new techniques such as vibrational spectroscopy. This study correlates the biomarker protein p16(INK4A) expression levels dependent on HPV copy number with the infrared absorption spectral signatures of the cervical cancer cell lines, HPV negative C33A, HPV-16 positive SiHa and CaSki and HPV-18 positive HeLa. Confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that p16(INK4A) is expressed in all investigated cell lines in both nuclear and cytoplasmic regions, although predominantly in the cytoplasm. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the p16(INK4A) expression levels and demonstrated a correlation, albeit nonlinear, between the reported number of integrated HPV copies and p16(INK4A) expression levels. CaSki cells were found to have the highest level of expression, HeLa intermediate levels, and SiHa and C33A the lowest levels. FTIR spectra revealed differences in nucleic acid, lipid and protein signatures between the cell lines with varying HPV copy number. Peak intensities exhibited increasing tendency in nucleic acid levels and decreasing tendency in lipid levels with increasing HPV copy number, and although they were found to be nonlinearly correlated with the HPV copy number, their dependence on p16(INK4A) levels was found to be close to linear. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the infrared absorption spectra revealed differences between nuclear and cytoplasmic spectroscopic signatures for all cell lines, and furthermore clearly differentiated the groups of spectra representing each cell line. Finally, Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was employed to construct a model which can predict the p16(INK4A) expression level based on a spectral fingerprint of a cell line, demonstrating the diagnostic potential of spectroscopic techniques.",

The prevalence of p16(INK4a), DAP-kinase, E-Cadherin, and RASSF1A promoter methylation was 26/80 (32.5%), 19/80 (23.8%), 29/80 (36.3%), 6/80 (7.5%) respectively. In 48 cases (60%), at least one of these promoters was methylated. There was a significant association of methylation of any of these genes and ever smoking (P=0.006). p16(INK4a) gene promoter methylation was associated with a younger age of smoking initiation (P<0.03); E-Cadherin promoter methylation was associated with an increased number of pack years smoked (P<0.03).

DAP-kinase promoter methylation was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and this relationship was dependent upon p16(INK4a) promoter methylation status. Our results suggest that, in HNSCC, promoter methylation of these four genes accumulates with increasing tumor size.

Cell cycle progression is mediated by the activation of a highly conserved family of protein kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are also regulated by related proteins called cdk inhibitors grouped into two families: the INK4 inhibitors (p16, p15, p19, and p18) and the Cip/Kip inhibitors (p21, p27, and p53). Several studies report the importance of cell-cycle proteins in the pathogenesis and the prognosis of lung cancer. This paper will review the most recent data from the literature about the regulation of cell cycle. Finally, based essentially on the data generated in our laboratory, the expression, the diagnostic, and prognostic significance of cell-cycle molecules in lung cancer will be examined.",

Because HPV E7 protein inactivates the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, diffuse p16 expression is a surrogate marker for these high-risk HPV-related carcinomas. HPV E6 protein also inactivates p53, further compromising the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint. The Rb/p16/p53 immunohistochemical profile of BLC of the breast has not been well characterized. Tissue microarrays containing 71 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) of the breast were immunolabeled for p16, Rb, p53, and Ki-67. The cases included 4 distinct groups of IDCs having surrogate immunohistochemical profiles corresponding to categories defined by gene expression profiling (17 luminal A, 7 luminal B, 14 HER-2+, and 21 BLC), along with 12 unclassifiable triple negative carcinomas (UTNCs). Twenty-five of the 71 IDC were Rb negative/p16 diffuse positive (Rb-/p16+). These included 15 of 21 BLC and 9 of 12 UTNC, but only 1 of 14 HER-2 positive cases and none of the 17 luminal A or 7 luminal B cases (P<0.01, BLC or UTNC vs. others). Six of the Rb-/p16+ IDC also had a significant ductal carcinoma in situ component. The ductal carcinoma in situ in 4 of these 6 cases showed the same Rb-/p16+ phenotype as the associated IDC. BLC and UTNC had the highest Ki-67 indices of the 5 groups, even when matched for grade. The Rb-/p16+ phenotype and the Rb-/p16+/p53 overexpressing phenotype correlated with increased proliferation within the BLC group. In conclusion, BLC and UTNC, but not HER-2, luminal A, or luminal B carcinomas, frequently demonstrate an Rb-/p16+ phenotype, similar to the HPV-related squamous cell carcinomas that BLC resemble morphologically. This subset may represent a more homogenous group than BLC as defined currently.",

K-ras and p16 alterations were independent genetic events. Presence of K-ras or p16 genetic alterations (analyzed independently) was associated with shorter survival, although differences were not statistically significant. Cox analysis of the two variables combined showed a diminished survival as the results of an interaction between p16 and K-ras. Alternative alteration of K-ras and p16 genes was an independent prognostic factor in human colorectal cancer in univariate and multivariate analysis.

The p16 region examined was unmethylated in the four normal human breast specimens and in four out of nine breast tumours. In the other five independent breast tumour specimens, a uniform pattern of DNA methylation was observed. Of the nine major sites of DNA methylation in the amplified region from these tumour DNAs, four were in non-CG sequences. This unusual concentration of non-CG methylation sites was not a general phenomenon present throughout the genome of these tumour cells because the methylated CpG island regions of interspersed L1 repeats had a pattern of (almost exclusively) CG methylation similar to that found in normal breast tissue DNA and in DNA from tumours with unmethylated p16 genes.

SKOV3/DDP cells were stably transfected with pSUPER-EZH2 (EZH2 RNA interference plasmid) or pcDNA3.1-EZH2 (EZH2 gene overexpression plasmid) using the lipofection method. Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting confirmed that EZH2 expression was downregulated in pSUPER-EZH2-transfected cells. Flow cytometry revealed that EZH2 inhibition did not induce apoptosis, but significantly inhibited autophagy. In addition, it significantly increased the expression of the cellular senescence-signaling proteins p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, pRb, and p21, and significantly decreased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1, CDK2, and H3K27me3. Cellular senescence was characterized by a significant increase in the G0/G1 ratio and the restoration of sensitivity to cisplatin in the drug-resistant cells.

This peptide is internalized to the same extent as the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) TP10 and dose-dependently decreases proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 cells. Uptake of the ARF(1-22) peptide is associated with low membrane disturbance, measured by deoxyglucose and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, as compared to its scrambled peptide. Also, flow cytometric analysis of annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) binding and Hoechst staining of nuclei suggest that ARF(1-22) induces apoptosis, whereas scrambled or inverted peptide sequences have no effect. The ARF(1-22) peptide mainly translocates cells through endocytosis, and is found intact inside cells for at least 3 hours.

The NS-GFP system allowed us to monitor the differentiation process of normal neural stem/precursor cells by analyzing GFP fluorescence intensity. In tumor-bearing mice, despite the very high frequency of tumorigenic cells, we successfully identified the NS-GFP(+) cells as tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs). The clonal studies conclusively established that phenotypical heterogeneity can exist among the cells comprising a genetically homogeneous tumor, suggesting that this aggressive brain tumor follows the CSC model. Detailed analyses of the NS-GFP(+) brain tumor cells revealed that T-ICs showed activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, which functions in tumor invasiveness.

The CDKN2 gene on chromosome 9p21 that encodes the p16 inhibitor of cyclinD/Cdk4 complexes is a target of allelic loss and inactivation in a variety of human cancers and cell lines. However, the roles of 9p21 allelic losses and CDKN2 mutations in human neoplastic progression in vivo remain controversial. We determined the prevalence of allelic loss at 9p21 and mutations in CDKN2 in esophageal adenocarcinomas and investigated the order in which they occurred relative to the development of aneuploidy and cancer during neoplastic progression. Aneuploid cell populations from 32 patients with Barrett's esophagus who had premalignant epithelium, cancer, or both, were purified by DNA content flow cytometric cell sorting and evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-four of 32 informative patients (75%) had allelic loss at 9p21 in aneuploid cell populations. Premalignant epithelium was available for seven of the patients who had 9p21 allelic losses in cancer; allelic loss of 9p21 was detected before cancer in all seven (100%). Allelic loss of 9p21 preceded the development of aneuploidy in 13 of 15 patients (87%) who had aneuploid cell populations detected in premalignant epithelium, and the two events were detected simultaneously in the remaining two patients. Five of 22 aneuploid populations (23%) with 9p21 loss had somatic mutations in the remaining CDKN2 allele. The same mutations and 9p21 allelic losses were also found in the corresponding diploid cells from premalignant epithelium in all three cases that were evaluable. However, there was no evidence for mutation or homozygous deletion of p16 in the other 17 patients with 9p21 allelic loss.

We evaluated the expression of the tumour suppressors p14, p16 and p53 in pre-malignant and malignant squamous skin tumours, and its relation with risk factors for skin carcinogenesis (HPV, immune status and sun exposure). We performed immunohistochemical stainings for p14, p16 and p53 on paraffin embedded material of 71 pre-malignant squamous skin lesions and 34 squamous cell carcinomas, from 52 renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and 53 immunocompetent individuals. PCR-based assays were used for detection and genotyping of beta-papilloma virus (beta-PV) types and mucosal HPV types. P14 expression was independent of the expression of p16 and p53, irrespective of immune status and skin site. In 49 of 105 specimens (46.6%), one or more beta-PV types were detected. We found no significant association between p14, p16 or p53 protein expression and overall presence of beta-PV, irrespective of immune status. There was a significant association between presence of beta-PV and lesions from sun-exposed skin sites in the RTRs (P = 0.002). We conclude that in skin carcinogenesis, relations between the herein studied tumour suppressors and HPV are different from what one would expect based on findings in cervical neoplasia.

Restoration of RASSF1A inhibits tumor cell growth in vitro and in murine xenograft models. Rassf1a-deficient mice feature increased spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor formation. Mechanistically, RASSF1A affects several cellular functions, such as microtubule dynamics, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis; however, its tumor-suppressive mechanism is incompletely understood. To study the functional consequences of RASSF1A expression in human cancer cells, we made use of a doxycycline-inducible expression system and a RASSF1A-deficient lung cancer cell line. We observed that RASSF1A induces cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase and senescence in vitro and in tumors established in immunodeficient mice. RASSF1A-mediated growth inhibition was accompanied by the up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1) and proceeded independently of p53, p14(Arf), and p16(Ink4a). Loss of p21(Cip1/Waf1) or coexpression of the human papilloma virus 16 oncoprotein E7 was found to override RASSF1A-induced cell cycle arrest and senescence. Conditional RASSF1A affected mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B/Akt signaling to up-regulate p21(Cip1/Waf1) and to facilitate its nuclear localization. In summary, RASSF1A can mediate cell cycle arrest and senescence in human cancer cells by p53-independent regulation of p21(Cip1/Waf1).",

We examined p16INK4 expression in human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) cultures established from four normal donors. Normal HMECs divide a limited number of times before proliferation ceases in a state referred to as selection (or M0). The cell subpopulation that emerges spontaneously from selection undergoes a further limited period of proliferation before senescence. By immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of four independent cultures, we have shown loss of p16INK4 expression in postselection HMECs. In contrast, p16INK4 was present in both early and late passage fibroblasts from the same individuals. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed extensive methylation of the p16INK4 CpG island in post- but not preselection cells. Thus, the extended period of growth observed in postselection HMECs is associated with hypermethylation of the p16INK4 CpG island and loss of p16INK4 expression. Although postselection HMECs are widely considered to be normal, these data indicate that they have sustained an epigenetic alteration.",

The TP53 gene, regulating the p21 protein, is mutated at high frequency in ovarian cancer. The CDKN2 gene, encoding the p16 protein, has been mapped to chromosome 9p21 and encompasses three exons. To establish the frequency of CDKN2 gene abnormalities in ovarian tumour specimens, we have studied this gene in five ovarian cancer cell lines and in 32 primary and five metastatic ovarian adenocarcinomas. Using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing techniques both exon 1 and 2 of the CDKN2 gene, encompassing 97% of the coding sequence, were analysed. In addition, the TP53 gene was studied for the presence of mutations. The cell line HOC-7 showed a 16 bp deletion in exon 2 of the CDKN2 gene, resulting in a stop codon, whereas in cell line SK-OV-3 this gene was found to be homozygously deleted. Nine primary tumour specimens showed a migration shift on SSCP. Sequencing revealed a common polymorphism (Ala148Thr) in seven of these ovarian tumour specimens. The two other tumour samples were found to contain silent mutations, one at codon 23 (GGT-->GGA) and the other at codon 67 (GGC-->GGT). Mutations in the TP53 gene were observed in 46% of the ovarian tumour specimens. We conclude that CDKN2 gene alterations are rare events in human ovarian cancer. The low prevalence of these alterations do not allow for analysis of an association of this gene with prognosis.",

However, contrary to this, high aneuploidy is associated with aggressive tumour growth and poor survival prognosis, in particular in triploid breast cancer. A further paradox revolves around the observation that, while cell senescence should inhibit proliferation, the senescence marker p16INK4a correlates with poor treatment outcome in patients with a very aggressive triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC). In this study, we aim to pour light on the possible relationship of these conundrums with polyploidy of tumour cells. We performed detailed analysis of DNA histogram profiles in diagnostic core biopsies of 30 cases of operable breast cancer and found that near triploidy in TNBC and other forms correlated with weak or no response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) as scored by Miller-Payne index. Polyploid cells in operation samples from tumours that were non-responsive to NAC treatment were Ki67 and CD44 positive. In addition, polyploid cells were positive for markers of embryonic stemness (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG) and senescence (p16INK4a). The relationship patterns between p16INK4a and NANOG were heterogeneous, with predominantly mutually exclusive expression but also synergistic and intermediate variants in the same samples. We conclude that the aneuploidy and senescence paradoxes can be explained by the mutual platform of polyploidy, conferring genomic and epigenetic instability as a survival advantage. Such cells are able to bypass aneuploidy restrictions of conventional mitosis and overcome the barrier of senescence by a shift to self-renewal, resulting in progression of cancer. ",

Eventual spontaneous cessation of growth of these clones is closely correlated with increasing expression of the tumour suppressor gene p16(INK4a), suggesting that p16 may limit clonal expansion in this tumour model. We therefore hypothesised that p16 expression would also increase in vivo in follicular adenomas, and further that escape from growth control in follicular cancers would be accompanied by loss of p16 expression. This was tested using tissue microarrays, representing multiple stages of thyroid tumourigenesis. Whereas the majority of normal thyroids showed no immunostaining, p16 protein was readily detectable in follicular adenomas. Unexpectedly, however, p16 expression was also observed in follicular and papillary carcinomas. Poorly differentiated (insular) carcinomas showed either very intense staining, or a complete loss of staining.

We analyzed a series of 59 PSCCs and 8 condylomata for presence of HPV infection, for p16(INK4a), Ki-67, and p53 immunohistochemical expression, and for expression of a panel of cellular miRNAs (let-7c, miR-23b, miR-34a, miR-145, miR-146a, miR-196a, and miR-218) involved in HPV-related cancer.

Bypassing cellular senescence is a necessary step for cells to become immortal during oncogenic transformation. During the spontaneous immortalization of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) fibroblasts, we found that CREG1 (Cellular Repressor of E1A-stimulated Genes 1) expression was decreased during immortalization and increased in senescence. Moreover, we found that repression of CREG1 expression occurs via an epigenetic mechanism, promoter DNA methylation. Ectopic expression of CREG1 in the immortal LFS cell lines decreases cell proliferation but does not directly induce senescence. We confirmed this in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cancer cell lines, cancers commonly seen in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. In addition, we found that p16 (INK4a) is also downregulated in immortal cells and that coexpression of CREG1 and p16 (INK4a) , an inhibitor of CDK4/6 and Rb phosphorylation, has a greater effect than either CREG1 and p16 (INK4a) alone to reduce cell growth, induce cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence in immortal LFS fibroblasts, osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines. Moreover, cooperation of CREG1 and p16 (INK4a) inhibits the expression of cyclin A and cyclin B by inhibiting promoter activity thereby decreasing mRNA and protein levels; these proteins are required for S-phase entry and G2/M transition.

SCLC cells stably transfected with the p16INK4A expression vector formed only 2-16% of the number of neomycin-resistant colonies formed by cells transfected with a control vector, and no expression of exogenous p16INK4A protein was detected in any of 16 expanded clones. Transient transfection of the p16INK4A gene into SCLC cells resulted in exogeneous p16INK4A protein expression and dephosphorylation of endogenous retinoblastoma (RB) protein. These results suggest that the restoration of the p16INK4A function suppresses the growth of SCLC cells by dephosphorylation of the RB protein. Therefore, inactivation of p16INK4A may play an important role in the enhancement of growth of p16INK4A(-) RB(+) SCLC tumors in vivo.",

Stimulation of Bmi1 expression by ERα or 17β-estradiol (E2) was analyzed in cell lines including MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, ERα-restored MDA-MB-231 and ERα-knockdown MCF-7 cells. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were also performed.;Immunostaining revealed strong correlation of Bmi1 and ERα expression status in breast cancer. Expression of Bmi1 was stimulated by 17β-estradiol in ERα-positive MCF-7 cells but not in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, while the expression of Bmi1 did not alter expression of ERα. As expected, stimulation of Bmi1 expression could also be achieved in ERα-restored MDA-MB-231 cells, and at the same time depletion of ERα decreased expression of Bmi1. The proximal promoter region of Bmi1 was transcriptionally activated with co-transfection of ERα in luciferase assays, and the interaction of the Bmi1 promoter with ERα was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Moreover, in breast cancer tissues activation of the ERα-coupled Bmi1 pathway generally correlated with high levels of cyclin D1, while loss of its activity resulted in aberrant expression of p16INK4a and a high Ki-67 index, which implied a more aggressive phenotype of breast cancer.;Expression of Bmi1 is influenced by ERα, and the activity of the ERα-coupled Bmi1 signature impacts p16INK4a and cyclin D1 status and thus correlates with the tumor molecular subtype and biologic behavior. This demonstrates the important role which is played by ERα-coupled Bmi1 in human breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There is growing evidence that cancer-initiation could result from epigenetic changes. Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a transcription/translation factor that promotes the formation of tumors in transgenic mice; however, the underlying molecular events are not understood. To explore this in a human model system, YB-1 was expressed in mammary epithelial cells under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. The induction of YB-1 promoted phenotypes associated with malignancy in three-dimensional breast acini cultures. This was attributed to YB-1 enhancing the expression and activity of the histone acetyltransferase p300 leading to chromatin remodeling. Specifically, this relaxation of chromatin allowed YB-1 to bind to the BMI1 promoter. The induction of BMI1 engaged the Polycomb complex resulting in histone H2A ubiquitylation and repression of the CDKN2A locus. These events manifested functionally as enhanced self-renewal capacity that occurred in a BMI1-dependent manner. Conversely, p300 inhibition with anacardic acid prevented YB-1 from binding to the BMI1 promoter and thereby subverted self-renewal. Despite these early changes, full malignant transformation was not achieved until RSK2 became overexpressed concomitant with elevated human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) activity. The YB-1/RSK2/hTERT expressing cells formed tumors in mice that were molecularly subtyped as basal-like breast cancer. We conclude that YB-1 cooperates with p300 to allow BMI1 to over-ride p16(INK4a) -mediated cell cycle arrest enabling self-renewal and the development of aggressive breast tumors.",

In this study, we thus investigated whether immunocytochemistry for p21(WAF1/Cip1) and p16(INK4a) could be applicable in the diagnosis and the prognostic prediction of SIL in combination with genomic analyses of HPV. The genomic analysis of high-risk HPV (hrHPV), which was done by reversed dot blotting and by in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemistry were performed on liquid-based cytological specimens. A cross-sectional study comprising 145 cases of NILM, ASC-US, LSIL, and HSIL indicated that the incidence of the positive cases for p16(INK4a) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) and hrHPV increased with the grade of SIL. A double positive status for p16(INK4a) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) was a significant discriminator between HSIL and LSIL/NILM, even when applied in conjunction with the genomic test for hrHPV (P = 0.006 by logistic regression analysis). However, a prospective study employing 61 NILM/ASC-US cases, revealed that the p16(INK4a) /p21(WAF1/Cip1) immunostaining was not a significant predictor for the progression of SIL, whereas the cytological diagnosis (NILM vs. ASC-US) and the infection status of hrHPV conferred significant effects on the prognosis. Immunostaining of p16(INK4a) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) provides additional information on the cytological diagnosis of SIL.

However, other effects of p16 that may potentially contribute to p16-mediated anti-tumor ability have not been well studied. The emerging data including ours indicated that p16 contributes its anti-cancer ability by inducing tumor cells to senescence. Moreover, we showed that p16 inhibits breast cancer cell growth by inhibiting the VEGF signaling pathway and angiogenesis. In this study, we used adenoviral-mediated p16 expression (AdRSVp16) and breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as the model to simultaneously analyze all these p16's anti-tumor functions. We demonstrated that adenoviral-mediated p16 expression exhibited multiple anti-tumor functions by simultaneously suppressing in vitro growth and in vivo angiogenesis of breast cancer cells, blocking cell division, as well as inducing senescence and apoptosis. The in vivo study implies that p16's effect on anti-angiogenesis may play a more significant role than its anti-cell proliferation in the overall suppression of tumor growth. These results suggest, for the first time, that AdRSVp16-mediated tumor suppression results from a combination of p16's multiple anti-tumor functions including p16's well-known anti-proliferation/cell division function, apoptotic and senescence induction function, and its lesser-known/under-investigated anti-angiogenesis function. These combined results strongly indicate that p16 gene therapy has a multi-module platform with different anti-tumor functions; therefore, this study justifies and promotes the viral-mediated p16 gene therapy as a promising and powerful treatment approach for cancer patients due to p16's multiple anti-tumor functions.",

However, it has been shown that oncogenic ras inhibits growth of primary cells, through pathways involving p53 and the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p19ARF. We have analysed the effect of the ectopic expression of the three mammalian ras genes on the proliferation of K562 leukemia cells, which are deficient for p53, p16INK4a, p15INK4b and p19ARF genes. We have found that high expression levels of both wild-type and oncogenic H-, K- and N-ras inhibit the clonogenic growth of K562 cells. Induction of H-rasV12 expression in K562 transfectants retards growth and this effect is accompanied with an increase of p21WAF1 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, p21WAF1 promoter is activated potently by oncogenic ras and less pronounced by wild-type ras. This induction is p53-independent since a p21WAF1 promoter devoid of the p53 responsive elements is still activated by Ras. Finally, inhibition of p21WAF1 expression by an antisense construct partially overcomes the growth inhibitory action of oncogenic H-ras. Altogether, these results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of ras in myeloid leukemia cells is associated to the induction of p21WAF1 expression and suggest the existence of p19ARF and p16INK4a-independent pathways for ras-mediated growth inhibition.",

We also demonstrate two separate areas of deletion on 9p, one centromeric to IFNbeta and telomeric to CDKN2 and the other centromeric to CDKN2 and telomeric to the polymorphic marker D9S19. All the deletions involve either the markers IFNalpha and/or D9S171 and D9S126 but not necessarily CDKN2.;These results suggest another tumor suppressor gene (TSG) may be involved in HNSCC carcinogenesis and may play a role in aggressive disease as manifest by local, regional, or distant recurrence.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite significant advances in the detection and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma remains very poor, in part due to the high incidence of recurrence. This study was aimed at identifying a prognostic indicator of recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed CpG island hypermethylation of the p14, p15, p16, GSTP1, integrin alpha4, SYK, and CDH1 genes in fresh-frozen tissues from 265 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma using the methylation-specific PCR. The expression levels of p16 and p53 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. CpG island hypermethylation was detected in 6% for p14, 21% for p15, 67% for p16, 75% for GSTP1, 23% for integrin alpha4, 12% for SYK, and 57% for CDH1. Recurrence was observed in 102 (38%) of the 265 patients. There was no association between the risk for recurrence and hypermethylation of any gene studied. However, p16 methylation was associated with a poor survival after surgery for recurrent stage I to II hepatocellular carcinomas (hazard ratio, 4.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-14.20; P = 0.03). In addition, the hazard of failure after recurrence was about 3.80 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-14.20; P = 0.04) times higher in patients with p16 methylation than in those without. Negative expression of p16 at a protein level was also associated with poor survival in recurrent stage I to II hepatocellular carcinomas, but p53 expression did not have a synergistic effect on the poor prognosis. In conclusion, the present study suggests that p16 methylation may be associated with a poor prognosis in recurrent early-stage hepatocellular carcinomas.",

We investigated the frequency of different potential mechanisms of CDKN2A inactivation in oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (OTSCC) and their impact on patient outcome. From a cohort of 153 OTSCC patients, 131 formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks of pre-treatment primary tumours were suitable for further molecular analysis. We assessed CDKN2A (p16) levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC), promoter methylation status by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, mutation status by Sanger sequencing, gene copy number variation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and correlated these with patient outcome. We found that the majority of OTSCC did not overexpress p16 (110/116, 95%), assessed by IHC. The frequency of CDKN2A mutations was 20% (21/103), homozygous loss was 7% (7/97), hemizygous loss 31% (30/97), and promoter methylation was 18% (20/113). We found no evidence of these mechanisms in 24/106 (23%) p16 IHC negative tumours. No significant correlation was identified between any potential mechanism of CDKN2A inactivation and clinical features, including smoking status and age. There was a non-significant trend for worse overall survival for p16 IHC negative patients versus positive patients (HR = 1.81, 95% CI = 0.44-7.47, p = 0.40). No relationship was found between mechanisms of CDKN2A disruption and patient outcome. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CDKN2A alteration is a frequent event in OTSCC tumourigenesis.

Loss of Cdk4 regulation can occur through overexpression of Cdk4 catalytic subunit or its regulatory partner cyclin D1, or if the Cdk4-specific inhibitory protein p16(INK4A) is inactive. We have attempted to express the two human subunits, Cdk4 and cyclin D1, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Surprisingly, expression of Cdk4 alone, under control of the strong GAL promoter, inhibits cell growth. Coexpression of both subunits allows formation of an active Cdk4-cyclin D1 complex which accentuates growth arrest. In cells expressing Cdk4 only, growth is restored by overexpressing human Cdc37, a Cdk4-binding molecular chaperone. Interestingly, the effect of Cdk4 on yeast is also overcome by both p16- and p21-families of Cdk-inhibitory proteins. Moreover, flavopiridol, a compound which inhibits Cdk4 enzyme activity, restores cell division. The fact that p16(INK4A) and flavopiridol negate Cdk4-mediated suppression of yeast cell growth implies that this simple system can be used as a screen for identifying Cdk4-specific antagonists which may mimic p16(INK4A) in the cancer cell cycle.",

Of 28 small cell carcinomas, 26 (93%) small cell carcinomas showed diffuse moderate or strong staining for thyroid transcription factor-1 with no staining for high molecular weight keratin and p63. In contrast, 27/28 (96%) poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas manifested opposite immunoreactivities, with diffuse moderate or strong staining for high molecular weight keratin and p63, and no or minimal staining for thyroid transcription factor-1. In two additional cases originally interpreted as small cell carcinoma, high molecular weight keratin highlighted small numbers of neoplastic large cells, leading to reclassification as combined small cell and non-small cell carcinomas. p16(INK4A) expression varied widely in poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas, but was consistently moderate or strong and diffuse in small cell carcinomas, and proved helpful in the two thyroid transcription factor-1-negative small cell carcinomas. This study demonstrates that a panel consisting of antibodies to thyroid transcription factor-1, p63, high molecular weight keratin, and p16(INK4A) is highly effective for distinguishing between small cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

We report here a clinical-epidemiological study, including the presence of additional neoplasias, in 14 apparently unrelated kindreds coming from a small geographic region of Northern Italy (Liguria), having therefore lived for generations in similar environmental conditions. We identified the common p16 missense mutation (Gly101Trp) reported in several previously studied kindreds, in 7 of 14 families, whereas the remaining 7 families had no detectable mutations in the coding region of p16 gene. Median age at diagnosis and other melanoma features were studied. When compared with the expected figures, based on regional incidence rates, a significant excess of pancreatic cancer, with 4 cases diagnosed, and of breast cancer, with 7 cases, was observed. The 7 families without apparent CDKN2A involvement were also negative for hot-spot exon 2 mutation of CDK4. Environmental factors do not appear to play a role in the excess of non-melanoma neoplasia in our families, as somewhat substantiated by the control group, composed of spouses and members of non-affected branches; they do not reveal any increased cancer incidence compared with the general population.

We analyzed 22 patients with CIS of the bladder (15 patients with isolated CIS, 7 patients combined with synchronous pTa or pT1 carcinomas) for gains and losses of chromosome (peri)centromere loci 1q12, 7p11-q11, 9p11-q12, and 9p21 harboring the INK4A/ARF locus (p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF)) and INK4B (p15(INK4B)) by multiple-target fluorescence in situ hybridization, and for p53 protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry. In 15 of 20 (75%) CIS lesions analyzed p53 overexpression was detected, whereas aneusomy for chromosomes 1 and 7 was identified in 20 of 22 (91%) CIS. In 13 of 22 (60%) CIS cases analyzed, 12 of which were not associated with a synchronous pTa or pT1 carcinoma, no numerical losses for chromosome 9 (p11-q12 and 9p21) were detected as compared with chromosomes 1 and 7. Furthermore 6 of 12 (50%) patients showed a metachronous invasive carcinoma within 2 years. In the remaining nine biopsies CIS lesions (40%) were recognized that showed losses of chromosome 9p11-q12 and 9p21, six of these were associated with a synchronous pTa or pT1 carcinoma. Three of these carcinomas were pTa and exhibited loss of 9q12 as well as a homozygous deletion of 9p21. The others were invasive carcinomas in which CIS lesions were also recognized that showed no numerical loss of chromosome 9, but did show an accumulation of p53. In conclusion our data demonstrate that predominantly isolated CIS lesions contained cells with no specific loss of chromosome 9, as opposed to CIS lesions with synchronous carcinomas that showed evidence of chromosome 9 loss. Furthermore our data strengthen the proposition that p53 mutations (p53 overexpression) precede loss of chromosomes 9 and 9p21 in CIS as precursor for invasive bladder cancer, as opposed to noninvasive carcinomas where chromosome 9 (9p11-q12) losses are early and frequently combined with homozygous deletions of 9p21.",

Potential contributors disease aetiology include oncogenic viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), an established culprit of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, one of the most frequent cancers in Sudan.In this study, DNA was extracted from malignant tissue samples and healthy tumour-free tissue from the same breast. Polymerase chain Reaction (PCR) was used to amplify two genes encoding for EBV viral proteins. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus and its cellular localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) for Epstein-Barr encoded small RNAs (EBERs). Given the reported low frequency of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Sudanese breast cancer patients, the methylation status of six tumor suppressor genes was investigated using methylation specific PCR. EBV genome was detected in 55.5% (n = 90) of breast cancer tissues as compared to 23% in control tissue samples (p = 0.0001). Using ISH, EBV signal was detected in all 18 breast cancer biopsies examined while all five normal breast tissue biopsies tested were negative for EBV. Of six tumour suppressor genes investigated BRCA1, BRCA2, and p14 appeared to be under strong epigenetic silencing.In conclusion, we present evidence of a strong association between EBV and breast carcinoma in Sudanese patients, and considerable epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors that may likely be an outcome or an association with viral oncogenesis.

        "Doc_abstract":"The retinoblastoma (RB) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2/multiple tumor suppressor gene 1 (CDKN2/MTS1) tumor suppressor genes play important roles in the regulation of the cell cycle. The protein products of these two genes, pRB and p16INK4A (\"p16\"), respectively, inhibit progression from G1 to S phase. Moreover, p16 has been shown to exert its function through inhibition of CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of pRB. Both genes have been found to be mutated or deleted in a wide range of primary human tumors and tumor cell lines. However, the presence of CDKN2/MTS1 containing nonneoplastic elements in every tumor specimen may contribute to the apparent lower deletion detection rate in resected neoplasms compared to cell lines. We have developed an immunohistochemical assay that allows us to assess p16 expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. As controls, we used paraffin-embedded pellets of cell lines with well-defined p16 status (four positive and four negative lines), as well as routinely processed nude mouse xenografts of two p16-positive cell lines. p16-negative cells were characterized by the absence of nuclear staining, whereas cytoplasmic staining was variable. In neoplastic and normal tissues, the level of p16 generally appeared to be low. We tested 75 random human malignancies from 4 different anatomic sites for p16 expression and correlated the findings with the immunohistochemical presence or absence of pRB. Twenty % of tumors selectively lacked pRB, while 37% of neoplasms had undetectable p16. In 43% of all carcinomas, both pRB and p16 could be detected. Significant differences existed in the expression of both tumor suppressor genes between carcinomas from different sites. Breast cancers had the highest rate of p16 negativity (13 of 20). Our data show that: (a) immunohistochemistry may be a suitable modality to screen for RB and CDKN2/MTS1 abnormalities in paraffin-embedded tissues; (b) undetectable levels of p16 expression occur at a relatively high frequency; (c) p16 and pRB expression in common human malignancies is not mutually exclusive; (d) loss of function of both tumor suppressor genes appears to be a distinctly uncommon phenomenon; and (e) different types of carcinomas have variable rates of disturbance in the p16/pRB pathway.",

Telomerase activity is an immortalization marker that is found in most cancers and for which an association with an active cell cycle has been implicated. In the tissue of 106 human breast carcinomas, we analyzed the relationship between telomerase activity levels and defects in the cell cycle machinery with a focus on the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway(s). The fraction of telomerase-positive tumors was 85%, and large differences in telomerase activity were found. Overexpression of cyclin D1 and/or cyclin E, in combination with a normal pRB, was a typical feature of tumors with high telomerase activity levels. Down-regulation of p16INK4 was not related per se to telomerase activity, but tumors with low p16INK4 in combination with cyclin D1 or E overexpression demonstrated high activity. Tumor cell proliferation, determined by Ki-67 expression, correlated significantly to telomerase activity levels. There was, however, not a strict association between proliferation rate and telomerase activity, because tumors with inactivated pRB had the highest Ki-67 fractions but intermediate telomerase activity. Also, cyclin D1 overexpression was associated with high telomerase levels without an increase in tumor cell proliferation. The present study indicates that telomerase activation occurs preferentially in breast cancers with certain cell cycle regulatory defects and that telomerase activity levels may depend on the specific defect(s).",

This study has compared the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), and p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry in the assessment of HPV status in TSCC. Archival specimens of TSCC from thirty patients were investigated. HPV was detected by PCR in 25/30 (83.3%) tumors; HPV16 (70.0%) and HPV52 (6.7%) were the most common types. HPV was corroborated by CISH in 22/25 (88.0%) specimens; integrated HPV was implicated by the presence of punctate signals in each of these cases. p16(INK4a) staining was found in 20/22 (90.9%) HPV PCR positive samples; two PCR/CISH HPV positive cases were p16(INK4a) negative and two HPV negative samples were p16(INK4a) positive. These data suggest that a minority of HPV positive TSCCs are positive for passenger HPV and that two or more assays may be required for diagnosing driver HPV status. Further studies are required to exam whether oropharyngeal tumors positive for passenger HPV have a less favorable prognosis than tumors that are driver HPV positive. The clinical significance of TSCCs that test HPV negative/p16(INK4a) positive, PCR and CISH HPV positive/p16 (INK4a) negative, or PCR HPV positive/p16 (INK4a) and CISH negative, also requires further investigation.",

Cervical biopsies from 2 South African cervical cancer screening studies originally diagnosed by a single pathologist were reevaluated by a second pathologist and a consensus pathology diagnosis obtained. Immunohistochemical staining for p16(INK4A) was then performed. The estimated sensitivity of some cervical cancer screening tests was markedly impacted by the criteria utilized to define CIN 2,3. Use of routine histopathology markedly underestimated the sensitivity of both conventional cytology and HPV DNA testing compared to an improved gold standard of consensus pathology and p16(INK4A) positivity.

This dataset reveals 20 genes that are specifically mutated in either p19(ARF)-deficient, p53-deficient or wild-type mice (including Flt3, mmu-mir-106a-363, Smg6, and Ccnd3), as well as networks of significant collaborative and mutually exclusive interactions between cancer genes. Furthermore, we found candidate tumor suppressor genes, as well as distinct clusters of insertions within genes like Flt3 and Notch1 that induce mutants with different spectra of genetic interactions. Cross species comparative analysis with aCGH data of human cancer cell lines revealed known and candidate oncogenes (Mmp13, Slamf6, and Rreb1) and tumor suppressors (Wwox and Arfrp2). This dataset should prove to be a rich resource for the study of genetic interactions that underlie tumorigenesis.",

TBX2 has previously been shown to repress growth control genes such as p14(ARF) and p21(WAF1/cip1). In this study we show that TBX2 drives proliferation in breast cancer cells and this is abrogated after TBX2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or after the expression of a dominant-negative TBX2 protein. Using microarray analysis we identified a large cohort of novel TBX2-repressed target genes including the breast tumour suppressor NDRG1 (N-myc downregulated gene 1). We show that TBX2 targets NDRG1 through a previously undescribed mechanism involving the recruitment of early growth response 1 (EGR1). We show EGR1 is required for the ability of TBX2 to repress NDRG1 and drive cell proliferation. We show that TBX2 interacts with EGR1 and that TBX2 requires EGR1 to target the NDRG1 proximal promoter. Abrogation of either TBX2 or EGR1 expression is accompanied by the upregulation of cell senescence and apoptotic markers. NDRG1 can recapitulate these effects when transfected into TBX2-expressing cells. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism for TBX2-driven oncogenesis and highlight the importance of NDRG1 as a growth control gene in breast tissue.",

This is also reflected by the frequent loss of the INK4A locus in acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells designed to conditionally express p16(INK4A) arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle and show increased sensitivity to glucocorticoid- and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 6-induced apoptosis. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism for increased death sensitivity, we interfered with specific steps of apoptosis signaling by expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. We found that alterations in cell death susceptibility resulted from changes in the composition of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins, i.e. repression of MCL1, BCL2, and PMAIP1/Noxa and the induction of pro-apoptotic BBC3/Puma. Interference with Puma induction by short hairpin RNA technology or retroviral expression of MCL1 or BCL2 significantly reduced both glucocorticoid- and FAS-induced cell death in p16(INK4A)-reconstituted leukemia cells. These results suggest that Puma, in concert with MCL1 and BCL2 repression, critically mediates p16(INK4A)-induced death sensitization and that in human T-cell leukemia the deletion of p16(INK4A) confers apoptosis resistance by shifting the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins toward apoptosis protection.",

To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.",

None of the death associated protein kinase, O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase, p16INK4a, fragile histidine triad or adenomatous polyposis coli 1A promoter regions were positive for methylation in serum DNA from healthy persons. A total of 78.3% of the samples from lung cancer patients had methylation in at least one of the genes tested. The methylation status of fragile histidine triad was associated with that of p14ARF(p=0.021), as was retinoic acid receptor beta--with that of adenomatous polyposis coli 1A (p=0.04). Methylation of adenomatous polyposis coli 1A was detected more frequently in tumor with pleura involvement (p=0.079), retinoic acid receptor beta was observed more frequently in undifferentiated tumor than in better-differentiated tumor (p=0.029). The methylation status of RAS association domain family 1A and fragile histidine triad showed a tendency to be associated with an advanced tumor size. In addition, tumors with an advanced pathological stage showed epigenetic alteration of the RAS association domain family 1A promoter with a higher frequency. The methylation index was also associated with an advanced tumor size (p=0.033).;Approximately 80% of the samples from lung cancer patients had methylation of the tumor suppressor gene and it might be associated with more aggressive tumor. Detection of epigenetic alterations in serum may provide basis for the early and noninvasive lung cancer diagnosis and customized therapy.",

Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are associated with HNSCC tumorigenesis, including inactivation of CDKN2A, which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor, in cell lines and primary tumors by DNA methylation. Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors shows therapeutic promise for other cancers. Therefore, we investigated the ability of these agents to reactivate p16 in Tu159 HNSCC cells. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increases CDKN2A expression and slightly increases histone H3 acetylation at this gene. No reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but synergistic reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon sequential treatment of Tu159 cells with both 5-aza-dC and TSA. Silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 cells is correlated with increased methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and decreased methylation at lysine 4 relative to the upstream p15 gene promoter. Interestingly, global levels of H3-K9 methylation are decreased upon treatment with 5-aza-dC. Together these data indicate that DNA methylation is a dominant epigenetic mark for silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 tumor cells. Moreover, changes in DNA methylation can reset the histone code by impacting multiple H3 modifications.",

Based on recent reports, BRAF mutations provide an alternative route for activation of the RAS signalling pathway. The CDKN2A (p16) tumour suppressor gene is also altered in several tumour types. We therefore wanted to assess the pattern and prognostic impact of BRAF mutations and p16 alterations in endometrial carcinomas. Only 1 of 48 tumours (2%) was found to have a BRAF mutation in exon 15, whereas 8 of 45 tumours (18%) had a K-ras mutation. Homozygous deletion, amplification, promoter region methylation or mutation of the p16 gene was seen in 6 cases (13%), and 18 cases (38%) carried polymorphisms in the p16 gene. All tumours with presence of p16 methylation, non-sense mutation, deletion or amplification exhibited loss of p16 expression as evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Presence of a p16 hit was significantly correlated with high FIGO stage (p = 0.04), high histologic grade (p = 0.02), estrogen receptor negativity (p = 0.05), pathologic expression of p53 (p = 0.02), pathologic expression of p16 (p = 0.05) and poor survival (p = 0.02). There was also a significant correlation between loss of p16 expression and K-ras mutations, pathologic p53 expression and serous papillary/clear cell histologic types (p = 0.05/p = 0.001/p = 0.002). In conclusion, BRAF mutation is an infrequent finding in endometrial carcinomas. Loss of p16 expression is seen in all cases with alterations of the p16 gene. The presence of a p16 hit might be important in a subset of endometrial carcinomas with aggressive clinical behaviour. However, the mechanism of p16 inactivation remains unclear for the majority of cases exhibiting loss of expression, but the interactions with K-ras and p53 should be further studied.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The regulation of p14ARF gene by E2F transcription factor, which differs from that of classical E2F targets, has recently been attributed to a variant E2F-response element. However, promoter assays suggest multiple elements present in the p14ARF promoter and argue against the idea that the ARF promoter has a unique ability to distinguish between aberrant and physiological levels of E2F1. Therefore, the functional characterization of the promoter still needs to be done. We demonstrate that at least two overlapping E2F1/Sp1 binding sites are present in the p14ARF promoter, and E2F1 activates the promoter through displacing constitutive Sp1 from the overlapping sites. We found that 8-chloro-adenosine (a metabolite of 8-Cl-cAMP) exposure induced the p14ARF gene in human lung cancer H1299 cells, followed by increased expression of E2F1 and constitutive expression of Sp1. The combination of cotransfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that constitutive binding of Sp1 to the overlapping sites contributed to a constitutive expression of the ARF gene in unexposed H1299, whereas displacing Sp1 from the overlapping sites by E2F1 promoted the gene activation after exposure. EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed increased association of E2F1 with the overlapping sites in the active promoter in 8-Cl-Ado-exposed cells. Together, these data suggest that the overlapping E2F1/Sp1 site, being present in multiple copies in the p14ARF promoter, may serve as the targets for both E2F1 and Sp1, thereby playing a crucial role in response to some oncogenic signals and stimulators, which activate the ARF gene through inducing E2F in the cell.",

Array-based comparative genomic hybridization studies revealed deletions in the CDKN2A locus that include ARF and P16INK4A, both of which encode tumor suppressor proteins, in both human and mouse retinoblastoma. Through mouse genetic analyses, we found that Arf was the critical tumor suppressor gene in the deleted region. In mice, inactivation of one allele of Arf cooperated with Rb and p107 loss to rapidly accelerate retinoblastoma, with frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Arf locus. Arf has been reported to exhibit p53-independent tumor suppressor roles in other systems; however, our results showed no additive effect of p53 and Arf coinactivation in promoting retinoblastoma.

Animal models that can unravel the mechanisms underlying its progression are needed to develop rational and effective molecular therapeutic approaches. In this study, we report the development of mouse models for spontaneous gliomas representing distinct progressive stages of disease that are governed by defined genetic alterations. Neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC)-specific constitutive Ras activation in vivo plus p53 deficiency led to development of primarily anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III), whereas combined loss of p53 plus p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) led to development of GBM (grade IV) at 100% penetrance within 6 weeks. These glioma models showed enhanced stem cell properties (stemness) accompanied by malignant progression. Notably, we determined that, in our models and in human specimens, downregulation of the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2.2, which is essential for oligodendroglial differentiation, was correlated with increased tumor malignancy. NKX2.2 overexpression by GBM-derived glioma-initiating cells (GIC) induced oligodendroglial differentiation and suppressed self-renewal capacity. By contrast, Nkx2.2 downregulation in mouse NPCs accelerated GBM formation. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of NXK2.2 on GIC self-renewal were conserved in human cells.

In this study, we showed that array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis of genome-wide CNAs can classify tumors on the basis of differing etiologies and provide mechanistic insights to specific biological processes. In a RAS-induced p19(Arf-/-) mouse model that experienced accelerated melanoma formation after UV exposure, array-CGH analysis was effective in distinguishing phenotypically identical melanomas that differed solely by previous UV exposure. Moreover, classification by array-CGH identified key CNAs unique to each class, including amplification of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 in UV-treated cohort, a finding consistent with our recent report that UVB targets components of the p16(INK4a)-cyclin-dependent kinase-RB pathway in melanoma genesis (K.

Although genetic depletion of Bmi1 has been described to result in tumor inhibitory effects partly through INK4A/Arf mediated senescence and apoptosis and also through INK4A/Arf independent effects, it has not been proven that Bmi1 can be causally involved in the formation of these tumors. To see whether this is the case, we developed two conditional Bmi1 transgenic models that were crossed with GFAP-Cre mice to activate transgenic expression in neural and glial lineages. We show here that these mice generate intermediate and anterior lobe pituitary tumors that are positive for ACTH and beta-endorphin. Combined transgenic expression of Bmi1 together with conditional loss of Rb resulted in pituitary tumors but was insufficient to induce medulloblastoma therefore indicating that the oncogenic function of Bmi1 depends on regulation of p16(INK4A)/Rb rather than on regulation of p19(ARF)/p53.

CIRP enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, and treatment with an MEK inhibitor decreased the proliferation caused by CIRP. In contrast to CIRP upregulation, CIRP downregulation decreased cell proliferation and resulted in inhibition of phosphorylated ERK1/2 inhibition. This is the first evidence that ERK1/2 activation, through the same mechanism as that described for a Val12 mutant K-ras to induce premature senescence, is able to bypass senescence in the absence of p16(INK4a), p21(WAF1), and p19(ARF) upregulation. Moreover, these results show that CIRP functions by stimulating general protein synthesis with the involvement of the S6 and 4E-BP1 proteins. The overall effect is an increase in kinase activity of the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex, which is in accordance with the proliferative capacity of CIRP MEFs.

        "Doc_abstract":"DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. Its expression is frequently up-regulated in human tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma, but the mechanism of overexpression and its biological significance remain unclear. Here, we show that hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) activates DNMT1 expression via a regulatory circuit involving the p16(INK4a)-cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-retinoblastoma protein (pRb)-E2F1 pathway. HBx induced DNA hypermethylation of p16(INK4a) promoter to repress its expression, which subsequently led to activation of G1-CDKs, phosphorylation of pRb, activation of E2F1, and finally transcriptional activation of DNMT1. Inhibition of DNMT1 activity by either treatment with 5'-Aza-2'dC or introduction of DNMT1 small interfering RNA not only abolished the DNA methylation-mediated p16(INK4a) repression but also impaired DNMT1 expression itself, suggesting a cross-talk between DNMT1 and p16(INK4a). The up-regulation of cyclin D1 by HBx is likely to serve as an initiative impulse for the circuit because it was absolutely required for the activation of DNMT1 expression. We also observed that accumulated DNMT1 via this pathway inactivates E-cadherin expression through promoter hypermethylation. Considering that the pRb-E2F1 pathway is commonly activated in human tumors, activation of this circuit might be widespread and a potential therapeutic target.",

CDKN2A and CDKN2B inhibit cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6 and control cellular proliferation by preventing entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Their inactivation may contribute to uncontrolled growth in human cancer. We previously described CDKN2A exon 2 mutations in a pilot study of 43 esophageal cancers. In order to determine whether CDKN2A and CDKN2B are frequent targets of 9p21 deletion in esophageal carcinogenesis, we have now analyzed 60 primary esophageal cancers for mutations in both exons 1 and 2 of CDKN2A and CDKN2B by direct sequencing of PCR amplified genomic DNAs. In conjunction with our previously published data, we have identified a total of eight nucleic acid substitutions among 60 esophageal carcinomas; here, we describe one new CDKN2B nonsense mutation and one new silent CDKN2B mutation that occurred somatically. Taken together, these results suggest that intragenic mutations in CDKN2A and CDKN2B occur in esophageal cancer, but that they are infrequent events. In view of the known high frequency of loss of heterozygosity at the chromosome 9p21 locus in esophageal cancers, the current data suggest that intragenic mutation is not the predominant mode of inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B or that other genes are targets of deletion at this locus in these cancers.",

In melanoma, proproliferative signals are provided by activating mutations in NRAS and BRAF, whereas senescence is bypassed by inactivation of the p16(Ink4a) gene. Melanomas also frequently exhibit constitutive activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway that is presumed to induce proliferation, as it does in carcinomas. We show here that, contrary to expectations, stabilized beta-catenin reduces the number of melanoblasts in vivo and immortalizes primary skin melanocytes by silencing the p16(Ink4a) promoter. Significantly, in a novel mouse model for melanoma, stabilized beta-catenin bypasses the requirement for p16(Ink4a) mutations and, together with an activated N-Ras oncogene, leads to melanoma with high penetrance and short latency. The results reveal that synergy between the Wnt and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways may represent an important mechanism underpinning the genesis of melanoma, a highly aggressive and increasingly common disease.",

These subpopulations of tumor cells have tumor-initiating properties and may be isolated from heterogeneous tumors when sorted or cultured in defined medium. We report the isolation and characterization of a population of tumor-initiating cells derived from an atypical meningioma. We identify a tumor-initiating population from an atypical meningioma, termed meningioma-initiating cells (MICs). These MICs self-renew, differentiate, and can recapitulate the histological characteristics of the parental tumor when transplanted at 1000 cells into the flank regions of athymic nude mice. Immunohistochemistry reveals stem-like protein expression patterns similar to neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) while genomic profiling verified the isolation of cancer cells (with defined meningioma chromosomal aberrations) from the bulk tumor. Microarray and pathway analysis identifies biochemical processes and gene networks related to aberrant cell cycle progression, particularly the loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A (p16(INK4A)), p14(ARF), and CDKN2B (p15(INK4B)). Flow cytometric analysis revealed the expression of CD44 and activated leukocyte adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166); these may prove to be markers able to identify this cell type. The isolation and identification of a tumor-initiating cell population capable of forming meningiomas demonstrates a useful model for understanding meningioma development.

K-ras mutations were detected in 16 out of 45 (36%) primary adenocarcinomas. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas with K-ras mutation have significantly less RASSF1A methylation and vice versa (P=0.001, chi(2) test).

We thus analysed the epigenetic patterns of 5 specific genes that are involved in stem cell fate (KLF4, NANOG), telomere maintenance (hTERT) and tumor suppression in cell cycle control (P16(INK4a), P21(WAFI/CIPI)) in chronically UVA-irradiated HaCaT human keratinocytes.

This alteration in histone modification together with a severe promoter hypermethylation strongly impaired the transcription of P16(INK4a) (20-fold and 40-fold for 10 weeks and 15 weeks UVA-irradiation, respectively). Analysis of the skin tumor-derived cells revealed the same severe impairment of the P16(INK4a) transcription attributed to promoter hypermethylation and enrichment of the heterochromatin histone mark H3K9me3 and the repressive mark H3K27me3. Less pronounced UVA-induced epigenetic alterations were also detected for the other genes, demonstrating for the first time that UVA is able to modify transcription of skin cancer associated genes by means of epigenetic DNA and histone alterations.",

This type of tumor is not preceded by precancerous changes and is associated with early-onset and hereditary syndromes. To test the hypothesis that DNA methylation profile would be useful for molecular classification of the diffuse type gastric carcinoma, DNA methylation patterns of the CpG Island of 17 genes were studied in 104 cases and 47 normal adjacent gastric mucosa by Methylation-specific PCR, Immunohistochemistry and Hierarchical clustering analysis. The most frequent methylated genes were FHIT, E-cadherin, BRCA1 and APC (>50%), followed by p14, p16, p15, p73, MGMT and SEMA3B (20-49%). Hierarchical clustering analysis reveals four groups with different clinical features. The first was characterized by hypermethylation of BRCA1 and younger age (<45 years old), and the second by hypermethylation of p14 and p16 genes, male predominance and Epstein-Barr virus infection. The third group was characterized by hypermethylation of FHIT and antrum located tumors and the fourth was not associated with any clinical variables. In normal adjacent mucosa only the p73 gene was significantly less methylated in comparison to tumor mucosa. DNA methylation identified subgroups of diffuse type gastric cancer. Hypermethylation of BRCA1 associated with young age suggests a role in early-onset gastric carcinoma.",

In the present study, we investigated the direct effect of Id-1 expression on human prostate cancer cell proliferation by transfecting an Id-1 expression vector into a prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Ten stable transfectant clones were isolated and the ectopic Id-1 expression resulted in both increased DNA synthesis rate and the percentage of S phase cells. To study the possible mechanisms involved in the Id-1 induced prostate cancer cell growth, we examined the expression of several factors responsible for G(1) to S phase progression. We found that Id-1 expression induced phosphorylation of RB and down-regulation of p16(INK4a) but not p21(Waf1)or p27(Kip1). Our results indicate that the Id-1 induced inactivation of p16(INK4a)/pRB pathway may be responsible for the increased cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells.

High-risk types of human papilloma viruses (HPV16 and HPV18) are the most significant risk factors for cervical cancer. HPV16/18-E6 oncoprotein is associated with HPV etiology, viral persistence and epithelial transformation. Cell cycle protein p16 INK4a (p16) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cervical carcinomas. The aims of this study were to investigate the expression of HPV16/18-E6 and p16 in uterine cervical carcinomas in Qassim Region--Saudi Arabia, and to relate the results to the established clinicopathological prognostic parameters (age of the patient, educational level, birth control methods, number of pregnancy, smoking status, degree of histological differentiation, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis) The study included 40 specimens of uterine cervical squamous cell carcinomas diagnosed and confirmed by biopsy. Histopathological classification of cervical tumors cases was performed according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Immunohistochemical analysis for HPV16/18-E6 and p16 were carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of cervical tissues using avidin-biotin peroxidase method. There was a significant statistical correlation between HPV16/18-E6 expression in cervical carcinoma and nationality, smoking status and size of the tumor. HPV16/18-E6 oncoprotein expression in normal lymphocytes and endothelial cells in the tumor tissues and the adjacent normal cervical tissues suggest the possibility that HPV infection might spread to other organs through blood circulation. P16 expression has been correlated with high grade, stage of cervical SCC and HPV16/18-E6 expression.

However, it remains to be examined whether occludin expression in transformed cells has an alternative impact that is important for cancer progression. Here we show that forced expression of occludin induces anoikis and promotes oxidative stress-induced premature senescence in breast carcinoma cells, which is accompanied by upregulation of negative cell cycle regulators such as p16(INK4A), p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) but not p53. The senescent phenotype is reversed by specific inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Endogenous reexpression of occludin mediated by a synergistic effect with a demethylator and histone deacetylase inhibitor or retinoids that stimulate retinoic acid receptor alpha is also sufficient for provoking the senescent phenotype. In addition, tumors that developed from occludin-expressing cells in mice showed a feature of cellular senescence that has not been described as a consequence of occludin signaling. These findings suggest that the loss of occludin expression is at least partially involved in the senescence-escape program during mammary tumorigenesis.",

In cervical cancers, pRb is inactivated by the HPV E7 oncoprotein or by mutations. The hypothesis of earlier reports was that the disruption of the p16/cdk-cyclin/Rb cascade is essential for malignant cervical transformation/carcinogenesis. We previously established in vitro model systems of cervical cancer representing four steps of oncogenic progression initiated by the two most common oncogenic HPVs in ectocervical and endocervical epithelial cells. This report used these systems to investigate the role of p16 in cervical cancers. A dramatic enhancement of the p16 RNA level was observed after immortalization by HPV 16 or 18. Furthermore, the p16 protein was newly observed following immortalization. However, no further changes were found for RNA or protein levels after serum selection or malignant transformation. For three cervical carcinoma cell lines, similar high levels of p16 expression were seen. Point mutations or homozygous deletions of p16 were not observed in the in vitro systems or in clinical specimens. These results suggest that the inactivation of the p16/cdk-cyclin/Rb cascade does not occur during malignant transformation but occurs during the immortalization by HPV in HPV-harbouring premalignant lesions, the in situ equivalent of immortalized cells. Also suggested is that p16 has no role in the specific malignant transformation step from immortal premalignant lesions during the carcinogenesis of HPV-initiated cervical cancers.",

According to the previous disparities concerning the importance of domains and inactivating mutations in p16, we aimed to search for the domain possessing the functional properties of the full length protein. Upon our in silico screening analyses followed by experimental assessments, we have identified the novel minimum functional domain of p16 to be the C-terminal half including ankyrin repeats III, IV and the C-terminal flanking region accompanied by loops 2 and 3. Transfection of this truncated form into HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, lacking endogenous p16, revealed that it is able to inhibit cell growth and proliferation equivalent to p16(INK4a). The functional analysis showed that this fragment like p16 can interact with CDK4/6, block the entry into S phase of the cell cycle and suppress growth as indicated by colony formation assay.

Both cyclin D1 overexpression and P16(INK4) loss of protein produce persistent hyperphosphorylation of Rb with resultant evasion of cell cycle arrest. To better establish the mechanisms of loss of Rb function in neuroendocrine lung tumors, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of the P16(INK4)/cyclin D1/Rb pathway in the spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors, including 34 typical carcinoids (TCs), 25 atypical carcinoids (ACs), 42 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs), and 79 small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs). Absence of Rb expression was not observed in TCs but was seen in 21% of ACs, 68% of LCNECs, and 87% of SCLCs. P16 was expressed in 91% of TCs, 77% of ACs, 78% of LCNECs, and 93% of SCLCs. Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in 6% of TCs, 20% of ACs, 9.5% of LCNECs, and 1.3% of SCLCs. There was an inverse relationship between Rb and P16 in high-grade tumors (P < 0.001) and a direct relationship between cyclin D1 and Rb (P < 0.001) in all tumors, demonstrating that P16 and cyclin D1 act exclusively on the Rb pathway for cell cycle regulation. Overall, the Rb pathway (Rb/P16(INK4)/cyclin D1) was altered more frequently in ACs than in TCs (P = 0.001) and more frequently in LCNECs than in ACs (P = 0.001). Although Rb-negative tumors had shorter survival in the overall group (P < 0.001) as a result of lack of Rb in most SCLCs, cyclin D1 overexpression and P16 loss did not influence survival in any individual category. We conclude that Rb pathway of G1 arrest is consistently compromised in high-grade neuroendocrine lung tumors (92%), primarily through loss of Rb protein, and is intact in low-grade TCs. In ACs an intermediate level of alterations (59%) is seen, consistent with their less-aggressive behavior compared with high-grade tumors.

In this study, we investigated how higher-order chromatin structure modulates differential expression of the human INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus during progenitor cell differentiation, cellular ageing and senescence of cancer cells.;We found that INK4b and INK4a, but not ARF, are upregulated following the differentiation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, in ageing fibroblasts and in senescing malignant rhabdoid tumour cells. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism we analysed binding of polycomb group (PcG) repressive complexes (PRCs) and the spatial organization of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus. In agreement with differential derepression, PcG protein binding across the locus is discontinuous. As we described earlier, PcG repressors bind the INK4a promoter, but not ARF. Here, we identified a second peak of PcG binding that is located approximately 3 kb upstream of the INK4b promoter. During progenitor cell differentiation and ageing, PcG silencer EZH2 attenuates, causing loss of PRC binding and transcriptional activation of INK4b and INK4a. The expression pattern of the locus is reflected by its organization in space. In the repressed state, the PRC-binding regions are in close proximity, while the intervening chromatin harbouring ARF loops out. Down regulation of EZH2 causes release of the approximately 35 kb repressive chromatin loop and induction of both INK4a and INK4b, whereas ARF expression remains unaltered.;PcG silencers bind and coordinately regulate INK4b and INK4a, but not ARF, during a variety of physiological processes. Developmentally regulated EZH2 levels are one of the factors that can determine the higher order chromatin structure and expression pattern of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus, coupling human progenitor cell differentiation to proliferation control.

Herein we showed that activation of CD47 in human astrocytoma cell lines U87 and CCF- STTG1 (Grade IV), up-regulated the expression of UHRF1 with subsequent down-regulation of p16(INK4A), thus promoting cell proliferation. Blockage of CD47 using a blocking antibody down-regulated UHRF1 expression, accompanied by a re-expression of p16(INK4A), conducting to decreased cell proliferation in both cancer cell lines. Neither CD47 activation nor its blocking has any effect on UHRF1/p16(INK4A) expression in normal human astrocytes. Depletion of CD47 in the U87 cell line resulted in down-regulation of UHRF1. We also found that CD47 activated the inflammatory genes IL-6, IL-7 and MCP-1 by a NF-κB-dependent mechanism in human astrocytoma but not in normal astrocytes. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that CD47 activation increases expression of UHRF1 and suggest, for the first time, that CD47 regulates the epigenetic code by targeting UHRF1. This could represent a new pathway towards cell proliferation and metastasis. ",

However, in gastric carcinoma, the relationship between methylation status and the transcriptional silencing of the p16 gene remains to be clarified. In this study, we investigated whether methylation of a few specific CpG sites in the promoter region could significantly down-regulate p16 activity in the tumorigenesis of gastric carcinoma. By Southern analysis and bisulfite-modified genomic sequencing of 9 gastric-carcinoma cell lines, we found that the 5 cell lines (55.5%) not expressing p16 mRNA had methylated CpG sites at the promoter region of p16. In addition, we analyzed the p16-protein expression of 28 primary gastric carcinomas and their normal counterparts by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on paraffin sections. Loss of p16 expression was detected in 6 cases (22%). In 5 out of these 6 (83%), the actual p16 gene was inactivated by de novo methylation of the promoter sites. Taken together, these results suggest a strong correlation between de novo methylation of a few specific CpG sites and transcriptional silencing of the p16 gene in gastric carcinoma.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate p16 ink4a and L1 as immunohistochemical markers of the biologic potentiality of low-grade dysplasia of the uterine cervix. The study included 38 conization specimens with coexisting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1) and 3 (CIN3) (group A) and 28 punch biopsies from women with CIN1 and proven spontaneous regression in the follow-up (group B). In group A, all CIN3 were p16 ink4a positive (p16+) and L1 negative (L1-). The CIN1 of this group were p16+L1- and p16+L1+ in 68.42% and 31.57%, respectively. No other expression pattern was found in this group. In group B, the p16+L1-, p16+L1+, p16-L1+, and p16-L1- patterns were found in 3.57%, 25%, 14.29%, and 57.14%, respectively. Overall, 96.29% p16+L1- CIN1 were found in group A, whereas all the p16-L1+ and p16-L1- CIN1 were found in group B. A significant difference between staining pattern distributions of group A and B was observed (P<0.0001). The results of the study show that p16 ink4a and L1 immunohistochemistry can be helpful for estimating the biologic potentiality of low-grade squamous cervical lesions.

Although p53 is well documented in IR response, the signaling network causing p53 activation in chronic IR remains to be identified. Using breast carcinoma MCF+FIR cells that showed a transient radioresistance after exposure chronically to fractionated IR (FIR), the present study shows that the basal DNA binding and transcriptional activity of p53 was elevated by FIR. p53-controlled luciferase activity was strikingly induced ( approximately 7.9-fold) with little enhancement of p53/DNA binding activity ( approximately 1.3-fold). The phosphorylated p53 (Thr 55) was increased in the cytoplasm and nucleus of MCF+FIR but not in the sham-FIR control cells. On the contrary, the sham-FIR control MCF-7 cells showed a low p53 luciferase transcription ( approximately 3-fold) but a striking enhancement of p53/DNA binding (12-fold) after 5 Gy of IR. To determine the signaling elements regulating p53 activity, DNA microarray of MCF+FIR using sham-FIR MCF-7 cells as a reference demonstrated that the mRNA of p21, MDM2, and p14ARF was up-regulated. Time course Western blot analysis, however, showed no difference in p21 induction. In contrast, MDM2 that was absent in control cells and was predominantly induced by IR was not induced in MCF+FIR cells. In agreement with MDM2 inhibition, MDM2-inhibitory protein p14ARF was increased in MCF+FIR cells. In summary, these results demonstrate that up-regulation of p14ARF paralleled with MDM2 inhibition contributes to p53 accumulation in the nucleus and causes a high responsiveness of p53 in chronic IR-treated breast cancer cells.",

In this study we analyzed the methylation status of four growth regulatory genes (p16, RASSF1A, cyclinD2, 14-3-3zeta) during breast cancer progression. For this purpose invasive and noninvasive tumor cell populations as well as hyperplastic cell proliferations were isolated from a series of archival breast tissue specimens (n = 57) using laser-assisted microdissection. A new real-time polymerase chain reaction-based assay was used for the sensitive and quantitative determination of the cell-specific methylation status. We found that aberrant promoter methylation was already prevalent in pure intraductal carcinoma with different frequencies and different methylation levels for the four genes analyzed. For RASSF1A and 14-3-3zeta promoter methylation was also demonstrated in epithelial hyperplasia and intraductal papillomas. By contrast, aberrant methylation of cyclinD2 and p16 was restricted to cancerous epithelium. Increased methylation of the cyclinD2 gene was significantly associated with a higher van Nuys grade. Furthermore, when intraductal and invasive tumor cells were compared, significant quantitative changes in the methylation level were detected primarily within the cyclinD2 gene. These results demonstrate that promoter methylation is an early and frequent event in breast cancer development, but displays great quantitative and gene-specific differences, and changes in a gene-specific manner during tumor progression.",

The frequency of cyclin D1 overexpression was similar in dysplasias and early cancers (30% vs. 35%). Loss of p16INK4 and p27KIP1 expression was less frequent in dysplasias than in early cancers (p=0.005 and 0.001, respectively).

The gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast carcinomas, similar to CDKN2A, a recognized tumor suppressor gene. Several research groups have shown that MTAP acts as a tumor suppressor, and some therapeutic approaches were proposed based on a tumors´ MTAP status. We analyzed MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression in seven breast cancer cell lines and evaluated their promoter methylation patterns to better characterize the contribution of these genes to breast cancer. Cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX) after MTAP gene knockdown showed an increased sensitivity, mainly to 5-FU. MTAP expression was also evaluated in two groups of samples from breast cancer patients, fresh tumors and paired normal breast tissue, and from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core breast cancer samples diagnosed as Luminal-A tumors and triple negative breast tumors (TNBC). The difference of MTAP expression between fresh tumors and normal tissues was not statistically significant. However, MTAP expression was significantly higher in Luminal-A breast tumors than in TNBC, suggesting the lack of expression in more aggressive breast tumors and the possibility of using the new approaches based on MTAP status in TNBC.

Thirteen clinical case-control studies, which enrolled a total of 465 MM patients and 180 healthy subjects, were included in the meta-analysis. The results of our meta-analysis demonstrated that the frequencies of p15 (INK4b) and p16 (INK4a) promoter methylation in cancer samples were significantly higher than in normal samples (p15 (INK4b) : OR = 6.26, 95 %CI = 3.87 ~ 10.12, P < 0.001; p16 (INK4a) : OR = 2.26, 95 %CI = 1.22 ~ 4.20, P < 0.001). Ethnicity-stratified analysis showed that the aberrant methylation of p15 (INK4b) was significantly related with the risk of MM among both Caucasians and Asians (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, our results also illustrated a strong positive correlation between p16 (INK4a) promoter methylation and the pathogenesis of MM among Asians (OR = 5.17, 95 %CI = 3.45 ~ 7.74, P < 0.001), but not among Caucasians (P > 0.05).

The effects of these mutations on the ability of p18 to bind and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6 or to inhibit cell growth were determined. Our results indicate that the third ankyrin repeat and the NH2-terminal portion of the fourth repeat constitute the essential element necessary for the ability of p18 to bind and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6.

DNMT inhibition changed histone marks into the active forms and decreased the methylation of CpG islands in the p16(INK4A) and p21(CIP1/WAF1) promoter regions. Enrichment of EZH2, the key factor that methylates histone H3 lysine 9 and 27 residues, was decreased on the p16(INK4A) and p21(CIP1/WAF1) promoter regions. We found that DNMT inhibition decreased expression levels of Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins and increased expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), which target PcG proteins. Decreased CpG island methylation and increased levels of active histone marks at genomic regions encoding miRNAs were observed after 5-AzaC treatment. Taken together, DNMTs have a critical role in regulating the cellular senescence of hUCB-MSCs through controlling not only the DNA methylation status but also active/inactive histone marks at genomic regions of PcG-targeting miRNAs and p16(INK4A) and p21(CIP1/WAF1) promoter regions.",

We reported previously that SM22α overexpression confers resistance against anti-cancer drugs or radiation via induction of metallothionein (MT) isozymes in HepG2 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that SM22α overexpression leads cells to a growth arrest state and promotes cellular senescence caused by treatment with a subclinical dose of γ-radiation (0.05 and 0.1 Gy) or doxorubicin (0.01 and 0.05 μg/ml), compared to control cells. Senescence growth arrest is known to be controlled by p53 phosphorylation/p21(WAF1/Cip1) induction or p16(INK4a)/retinoblastoma protein (pRB) activation. SM22α overexpression in HepG2 cells elevated p16(INK4a) followed by pRB activation, but did not activate the p53/p21(WAF1/Cip1) pathway. Moreover, MT-1G, which is induced by SM22α overexpression, was involved in the activation of the p16(INK4a)/pRB pathway, which led to a growth arrest state and promoted cellular senescence caused by damaging agents. Our findings provide the first demonstration that SM22α modulates cellular senescence caused by damaging agents via regulation of the p16(INK4a)/pRB pathway in HepG2 cells and that these effects of SM22α are partially mediated by MT-1G.",

Conditionally deleted Foxm1b mouse hepatocytes fail to proliferate and are highly resistant to developing HCC in response to a Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/Phenobarbital (PB) liver tumor-induction protocol. The mechanism of resistance to HCC development is associated with nuclear accumulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) protein and reduced expression of the Cdk1-activator Cdc25B phosphatase. We showed that the Foxm1b transcription factor is a novel inhibitory target of the p19(ARF) tumor suppressor. Furthermore, we demonstrated that conditional overexpression of Foxm1b protein in osteosarcoma U2OS cells greatly enhances anchorage-independent growth of cell colonies on soft agar. A p19(ARF) 26-44 peptide containing nine D-Arg to enhance cellular uptake of the peptide was sufficient to significantly reduce both Foxm1b transcriptional activity and Foxm1b-induced growth of U2OS cell colonies on soft agar. These results suggest that this (D-Arg)(9)-p19(ARF) 26-44 peptide is a potential therapeutic inhibitor of Foxm1b function during cellular transformation.

DNA from tumor tissue, normal breast epithelium when present, benign lesions (fibroadenoma, hyperplasia, papilloma, sclerosing adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia or atypical ductal hyperplasia), and in situ lesions of lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma were interrogated for promoter methylation status in 22 tumor suppressor genes using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA).

Hypermethylation of RASSF1 was most frequent, present in 14/17 cases, followed by APC in 12/17, and GSTP1 in 9/17 cases with establishment of an epigenetic monocloncal progression continuum to invasive breast cancer. Hypermethylated promoter regions in normal breast epithelium, benign, and premalignant lesions within the same tumor biopsy implicate RASSF1, APC, GSTP1, TIMP3, CDKN2B, CDKN2A, ESR1, CDH13, RARB, CASP8, and TP73 as early events. DNA hypermethylation underlies thepathogenesis of step-wise transformation along a monoclonal continuum from normal to preneoplasia to invasive breast cancer. ",

CDKN2A gene dosage (quantitative real-time PCR), allelic status (microsatellite analysis), hypermethylation (methylation-specific PCR), mutation status (denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and clinicopathologic variables (stage, grade, and disease recurrence during follow-up) were assessed.;Exon 2 was underrepresented in 20 of 46 (43%) and exon 1beta in 21 of 46 (46%) of cases. Underrepresentation of exon 2 was accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 9p in 6 of 18 (30%) and of exon 1beta in 11 of 19 assessable cases (58%). Overall, LOH of 9p was identified in 15/41 (37%). Homozygous deletion of exons 2 and 1beta was detected in 16 of 46 (35%) and 10 of 46 tumors (22%), respectively. Co-deletion was most common, but exon 2-specific homozygous deletion was also detected. In tumors without homozygous deletion, p16 promoter hypermethylation was detected in 1 of 18 (6%). Hypermethylation of the p14ARF promoter or mutations in CDKN2A were not observed. Homozygous deletion of exon 2 or LOH on 9p were associated with invasion. Homozygous deletion of exon 2 or exon 1beta was associated with recurrent disease.;These results confirm CDKN2A as a clinically relevant target for inactivation in UCC and show that the true frequency of alteration is only revealed by comprehensive analysis.

Evidence that the majority of adrenocortical tumors are monoclonal in origin suggests that a progressive accumulation of genetic aberrations, due to activation of protooncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, leads to abnormal cell proliferation through a multistep process. Inactivation of the p16 tumor suppressor gene (p16INK4A), which encodes the cell cycle protein p16, was investigated in a series of 14 adrenocortical tumors. Using 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning the short arm of chromosome 9, we demonstrated that three of seven adrenocortical carcinomas and one of seven adrenocortical adenomas had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within chromosome 9p21, the region containing p16NK4A. Immunohistochemistry showed the absence of p16 nuclear staining in all adrenocortical tumors with LOH within 9p21, and positive staining in all remaining tumors without LOH. In conclusion, LOH within 9p21 associated with lack of p16 expression occurs in a considerable proportion of adrenocortical malignant tumors, but is rare in adenomas.

Examination of the role of Foxp3 in differentiation by double immunostaining for cytokeratin 10 (CK10) showed significant association between Foxp3 expression and differentiation (Foxp3 vs CK10).

Following Dlc1 inactivation, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) with a conditional Dlc1 knockout allele reproducibly underwent neoplastic transformation. In addition to inactivation of Dlc1 and increased activity of Rho and Cdc42, transformation depended on the subsequent decreased expression of the Cdk4/6 inhibitors p15(Ink4b) and p16(Ink4a) together with increased expression and activation of Cdk4/6. The level of expression of these cell-cycle regulatory genes was relevant to human tumors with low DLC1 expression. Analysis of publicly available annotated datasets of lung and colon cancer with gene expression microarray profiles indicated that, in pairwise comparisons, low DLC1 expression occurred frequently together (P < 0.01) with downregulation of p15(Ink4b) or p16(Ink4a) or upregulation of CDK4 or CDK6. In addition, an unfavorable prognosis (P < 0.05) was associated with low DLC1 and low p15(Ink4b) in lung cancer and colon cancer, low DLC1 and low p16(Ink4a) in lung cancer, low DLC1 and high CDK4 in lung cancer, and low DLC1 and high CDK6 in colon cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Genetic lesions that disable key regulators of G1 phase progression in mammalian cells are present in most human cancers. Mitogen-dependent, cyclin D-dependent kinases (cdk4 and cdk6) phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein, helping to cancel its growth-inhibitory effects and enabling E2F transcription factors to activate genes required for entry into the DNA synthetic phase (S) of the cell division cycle. Among the E2F-responsive genes are cyclins E and A, which combine with and activate cdk2 to facilitate S phase entry and progression. Accumulation of cyclin D-dependent kinases during G1 phase sequesters cdk2 inhibitors of the Cip/Kip family, complementing the effects of the E2F transcriptional program by facilitating cyclin E-cdk2 activation at the G1-S transition. Disruption of \"the Rb pathway\" results from direct mutational inactivation of Rb function, by overexpression of cyclin D-dependent kinases, or through loss of p16(INK4a), an inhibitor of the cyclin D-dependent kinases. Reduction in levels of p27(Kip1) and increased expression of cyclin E also occur and carry a poor prognostic significance in many common forms of cancer. The ARF tumor suppressor, encoded by an alternative reading frame of the INK4a-ARF locus, senses \"mitogenic current\" flowing through the Rb pathway and is induced by abnormal growth promoting signals. By antagonizing Mdm2, a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, ARF triggers a p53-dependent transcriptional response that diverts incipient cancer cells to undergo growth arrest or apoptosis. Although ARF is not directly activated by signals that damage DNA, its loss not only dampens the p53 response to abnormal mitogenic signals but also renders tumor cells resistant to treatment by cytotoxic drugs and irradiation. Lesions in the p16--cyclin D-CDK4--Rb and ARF--Mdm2--p53 pathways occur so frequently in cancer, regardless of patient age or tumor type, that they appear to be part of the life history of most, if not all, cancer cells.",

While intensive studies have been focused on ARF activation at the transcriptional level, only recently mechanisms governing ARF turnover have been identified. Here, we show for the first time that p14ARF is a PKC target. Prediction analysis showed many potential phosphorylation sites in PKC consensus sequences within ARF protein, and, among them, the threonine at position 8 was the most conserved. Substitution of this threonine influences both ARF stability and localization. Furthermore, a phosphomimetic ARF mutation reduces the ability to arrest cell growth although the ability to bind MDM2 and stabilize p53 result unaffected.

DNA from MCF7(L) and MMU2 cells was also analysed by comparative genome hybridisation (CGH) to compare with SNP microarray data.

However the SNP chip array data additionally identified regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) followed by duplication of the remaining allele-uniparental disomy (UPD). Good concordance between SNP arrays and CGH analyses was observed, however there was poor correlation between gene copy number and protein levels between the cell lines. There were reductions in ERalpha, cyclin D1 and p27 protein levels whilst p21 protein levels were elevated in antiestrogen resistant MCF7 cell lines. Although protein levels varied there was no difference in gene copy number. This study shows SNP and CGH array analysis are powerful tools for analysis of allelic imbalance in breast cancer.

HSCs maintain themselves for the lifetime of the organism because of their ability to self-renew. However, multipotent progenitors lack the ability to self-renew, therefore their mitotic capacity and expansion potential are limited and they are destined to eventually stop proliferating after a finite number of cell divisions. The molecular mechanisms that limit the proliferation capacity of multipotent progenitors and other more mature progenitors are not fully understood. Here we show that bone marrow cells from mice deficient in three genes genetically downstream of Bmi1--p16Ink4a, p19Arf and Trp53 (triple mutant mice; p16Ink4a and p19Arf are alternative reading frames of the same gene (also called Cdkn2a) that encode different proteins)--have an approximately 10-fold increase in cells able to reconstitute the blood long term. This increase is associated with the acquisition of long-term reconstitution capacity by cells of the phenotype c-kit+Sca-1+Flt3+CD150-CD48-Lin-, which defines multipotent progenitors in wild-type mice. The pattern of triple mutant multipotent progenitor response to growth factors resembles that of wild-type multipotent progenitors but not wild-type HSCs. These results demonstrate that p16Ink4a/p19Arf and Trp53 have a central role in limiting the expansion potential of multipotent progenitors. These pathways are commonly repressed in cancer, suggesting a mechanism by which early progenitor cells could gain the ability to self-renew and become malignant with further oncogenic mutations.",

Candidate regions identified by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis include a region at 9p21 containing CDKN2A, which encodes p16 and p14(ARF), a large region at 9q12-31 including PTCH and many other genes, a small region at 9q32-33, which includes the DBCCR1 gene, and a region at 9q34 including the TSC1 gene. Experimental replacement of genes or chromosomes into tumor cells with appropriate deletions or mutations represents an important approach to test the functional significance of candidate tumor suppressor genes. Loss of an entire copy of chromosome 9 in many bladder tumor cell lines provides no indication of which gene or genes are affected, and selection of appropriate recipient cells for gene replacement is difficult. We have investigated three candidate tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, DBCCR1, and TSC1), at the DNA level and by expression analysis in a panel of bladder tumor cell lines, many of which have probable LOH along the length of the chromosome, as indicated by homozygosity for multiple polymorphic markers. Cytogenetically, we found no reduction in the numbers of chromosomes 9 relative to total chromosome count. Homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus was frequent but homozygous deletion of TSC1 was not found. A new cell line, DSH1, derived from a pT1G2 transitional cell carcinoma with known homozygous deletion of DBCCR1, is described. This study identifies suitable cell lines for future functional analysis of both CDKN2A and DBCCR1.",

However, there is growing evidence that micrometastases are present in lymph nodes, which cannot be detected with standard pathological methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hypermethylation gene promoter analysis was feasible on samples obtained by EUS-FNA from lymph nodes, as well as to establish the usefulness of this strategy for the detection of micrometastases in patients with gastrointestinal and non-small cell lung cancer. Suspicious lymph nodes based on EUS findings from consecutive patients with esophageal, gastric, rectal, and non-small cell lung cancer were sampled by EUS-FNA. Hypermethylation analysis of the MGMT, p16(INK4a), and p14(ARF) gene promoter CpG islands were performed by methylation-specific PCR. Effectiveness of conventional cytology, methylation analysis, and their combination were established with respect to the definitive diagnosis. Twenty-seven patients were included, thus representing a total of 42 lymph nodes (esophageal cancer, n = 11; rectal cancer, n = 7; gastric cancer, n = 3; and lung cancer, n = 21). According to definitive diagnosis, 21 (50%) corresponded to metastatic lymph nodes. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of conventional cytology were 76%, 100%, and 88%, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for the methylation analysis were 81%, 67%, and 74%, respectively. Combination of both techniques increased sensitivity (90%) but decreased specificity (67%) with respect to conventional cytology. In conclusion, it is feasible to detect occult neoplastic cells in EUS-FNA samples by hypermethylation gene promoter analysis. Moreover, addition of methylation analysis to conventional cytology may increase its sensitivity at the expenses of a decrease in its specificity.",

In addition, high apoptotic indices in tumors were related to positive HRK expression. Prostate cancers demonstrating HRK methylation also showed methylation of multiple other genes, such as p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), O(6)-MGMT, and GTS-P, but, with the exception of one case, p53 mutations were not detected. When compared to tumors having a Gleason score (GS) of 5-6, a significant difference in the apoptotic indices was found among prostate cancers of GS 7 (P < 0.001) or GS 8-9 (P = 0.007).

Detectable cell division cycle 7 expression was found in 1088 (57%) of breast cancer specimens and 228 (11.9%) exhibited a moderate or strong expression. High levels of cell division cycle 7 expression were significantly related to medullary histotype (P < .0001); high tumor grade (P < .0001); negative estrogen receptor status (P < .0001); high Ki67 expression level (P < .0001); p53 and p16 overexpression (P < .0001); and amplification of HER2 (P < .0001), c-myc (P < .0001), MDM2 (P = .043), CCND1 (P = .0084), and ESR1 (P = .0012) as well as with the number of amplified genes (P < .0001).

One of the main features of the UMS phenotype is the severe hypoplasia of the breast, associated with haploinsufficiency of the TBX3 gene product. In mice homozygous for the targeted disruption of Tbx3, the mammary glands (MGs) are nearly absent from early stages of embryogenesis, whereas in heterozygous adults, the MGs show reduced ductal branching. All these data strongly suggest a specific role of TBX3 in promoting the growth of mammary epithelial cells (MECs), although direct evidence of this is lacking. Here, we provide data showing the growth-promoting function of Tbx3 in several models of MECs, in association with its ability to repress the ARF promoter. However, no effect of Tbx3 on cell differentiation or apoptosis has been observed. The growth promoting function also entails the down-regulation of p21 ( CIP1/WAF ) and an increase in cyclin D1 but is independent of p53 and Mdm2 cell-cycle regulatory proteins, as p53-null MECs show similar growth responses associated with the up- or down-regulation of Tbx3. This is the first direct evidence that the level of Tbx3 expression positively controls the proliferation of MECs via pathways alternative to Mdm2-p53.",

Previously, it was suggested that reduction of the MAD2 gene, encoding a major component of the SAC, induced aneuploidy in human tumor cells. However, tumor cell lines contain multiple mutations that might affect or exacerbate the cellular response to Mad2 depletion. Thus, the scenario resulting by Mad2 depletion in primary human cells could be different and more complex that the one depicted so far. We used primary human fibroblasts (IMR90) and epithelial breast cells (MCF10A) to gain further insight on the effects of genomic instability caused by transient Mad2 depletion. To this aim we depleted Mad2 by RNAi to a level shown by Mad2 haplo-insufficient cells and found that induced aneuploidy caused premature cellular senescence in IMR90 cells. IMR90 cells showed typical features of senescent cells, like senescence-associated (SA) beta galactosidase expression, including up-regulation of p53 and p14ARF proteins and of p21(waf1) as well, but not of p16(INK4A) cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor. In contrast, after MAD2 post-transcriptional silencing MCF10A cells in which the INK4A/ARF locus is deleted, showed both aneuploidy and a small increase of p53 and p21(waf1) proteins, but not premature cellular senescence. Finally, our results provides an explanation of how a p53 controlled pathway, involving initially p21(waf1) and then p14ARF, could minimize the occurrence of genomic alterations derived from chromosome instability induced by low amounts of MAD2 protein.",

P16(INK4a) immunostaining correlates with the severity of cytological and histological abnormalities, but shows some methodological shortcomings such as the lack of standardized methodology and interobserver variability. This study evaluated quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) as an alternative tool to analyze p16(INK4a) overexpression as a biomarker for transforming HPV-infections in a liquid-based cervical cytology (LBC) setting. Sixty LBC samples, divided in three groups based on their cytological diagnosis, were subjected to HPV typing and analysis of p16 expression by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-PCR was determined by spiking HeLa and HaCaT cells. P16(INK4a) expression measured by RT-PCR did not correlate with the cytological diagnosis or HPV status (HPV-positivity, infection type and HPV16-positivity). The spiking experiment proved that, to detect increased biomarker expression by RT-PCR, about 1.0% dysplastic cells is required within a pool of normal keratinocytes. In conclusion, RT-PCR analysis of biomarker expression is not appropriate for cervical screening purposes. In typical LBC samples, the biomarker transcripts of the dysplastic cells are diluted by the RNA of the normal cells in such a manner that their overexpression cannot be detected by RT-PCR.",

This property is linked to increases in the expression and cell-surface presence of the fibronectin receptor. Considering its glycan chains as pivotal signals, we assumed an effect of p16(INK4a) on glycosylation. To test this hypothesis for human Capan-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, we combined microarray for selected glycosyltransferase genes with 2D chromatographic glycan profiling and plant lectin binding. Major differences between p16-positive and control cells were detected. They concerned expression of beta1,4-galactosyltransferases (down-regulation of beta1,4-galactosyltransferases-I/V and up-regulation of beta1,4-galactosyltransferase-IV) as well as decreased alpha2,3-sialylation of O-glycans and alpha2,6-sialylation of N-glycans. The changes are compatible with increased beta(1)-integrin maturation, subunit assembly and binding activity of the alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin. Of further functional relevance in line with our hypothesis, we revealed differential reactivity towards endogenous lectins, especially galectin-1. As a result of reduced sialylation, the cells' capacity to bind galectin-1 was enhanced. In parallel, the level of transcription of the galectin-1 gene increased conspicuously in p16(INK4a)-positive cells, and even figured prominently in a microarray on 1996 tumor-associated genes and in proteomic analysis. The cells therefore gain optimal responsiveness. The correlation between genetically modulated galectin-1 levels and anoikis rates in engineered transfectants inferred functional significance. To connect these findings to the fibronectin receptor, galectin-1 was shown to be co-immunoprecipitated. We conclude that p16(INK4a) orchestrates distinct aspects of glycosylation that are relevant for integrin maturation and reactivity to an endogenous effector as well as the effector's expression. This mechanism establishes a new aspect of p16(INK4a) functionality.",

The exact role of the two proteins encoded by this complex locus in this predisposition is unclear. Most mutations affect either CDKN2A only or products of both genes. Recently a deletion affecting ARF-specific exon 1beta was reported in a family with melanoma and neural tumours. However, the possibility of this deletion also altering the CDKN2A transcript could not be excluded. More convincingly, a 16 base pair insertion in exon 1beta has been reported in an individual with multiple melanomas suggesting a direct role for ARF in melanoma predisposition. We report here a splice mutation in exon 1beta in a family with melanoma that results in ARF haploinsufficiency. The mutation was observed in a mother and daughter with melanoma. A sibling of the mother with breast cancer also had this mutation. Analysis of the melanoma from one individual revealed a 62 bp deletion in exon 3 of the wildtype allele and loss of the mutant allele; these somatic changes would affect both CDKN2A and ARF. These somatic events suggest that concomitant inactivation of both ARF and CDKN2A may be necessary for melanoma development and that mutations in ARF and CDKN2A possibly confer different levels of susceptibility to melanoma, with the former associated with lesser predisposition. In this situation, the events follow a 'three-hit' model as observed in tumours from FAP patients with an attenuated phenotype. Overall, the data suggest a direct role for ARF haploinsufficiency in melanoma predisposition and co-operation between ARF and CDKN2A in tumour formation, consistent with recent observations in Cdkn2a-specific knockout mice.",

In contrast, combining RARbeta with either DAPK or RASSF1A showed a significantly shorter overall survival of those patients who had both genes methylated compared to those with only one or no epigenetic alteration (P=0.025 and 0.040, respectively). Similarly, the combination of all three genes revealed a worse prognosis for patients with double or triple methylations compared to the group which had only one or no gene methylated (P=0.028). Our results support the idea that the prognostic value of a combination of epigenetic alterations is superior to the impact of an individual gene alone on overall survival.",

However, in these tumors the exposure-associated pattern of somatic alterations in genes in the causal pathway for disease has been poorly characterized. In particular, the mechanism by which arsenic induces bladder cancer and the effects of lower environmental levels of exposure remain uncertain. Animal and in-vitro studies have suggested that arsenic and other exposures may act through epigenetic mechanisms. We, therefore, examined, in a population-based study of human bladder cancer, the relationship between epigenetic silencing of three tumor suppressor genes, p16(INK4A), RASSF1A and PRSS3, and exposure to both tobacco and arsenic in bladder cancer. Promoter methylation of each of these genes occurred in approximately 30% of bladder cancers, and both RASSF1A and PRSS3 promoter methylation were associated with advanced tumor stage (P<0.001 and P<0.04, respectively). Arsenic exposure, measured as toenail arsenic, was associated with RASSF1A (P<0.02) and PRSS3 (P<0.1) but not p16INK4A promoter methylation, in models adjusted for stage and other factors. Cigarette smoking was associated with a >2-fold increased risk of promoter methylation of the p16INK4A gene only, with greater risk seen in patients with exposures more recent to disease diagnosis. These results, from human bladder tumors, add to the body of animal and in vitro evidence that suggests a role in epigenetic alterations for bladder carcinogens.",

Recent studies showed that EGFR and K-RAS mutations exhibited a mutually exclusive pattern in adenocarcinoma of the lung, suggesting the presence of two independent oncogenic pathways. However, it is unknown how epigenetic alterations were involved in lung carcinogenesis mediated by EGFR or K-RAS mutation. In this study, we examined the relationship between genetic and epigenetic alterations in 164 cases of lung adenocarcinoma. Somatic mutations were determined by direct sequence of EGFR exons 18 to 21 and K-RAS codons 12 and 13. Methylation status of p16(INK4a), RASSF1A, APC, RARbeta, and CDH13, frequently methylated in lung cancer, was determined by methylation-specific PCR and the degree of methylation was defined as the methylation index. Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and smoking dose showed that the probability of having EGFR mutation was significantly lower among those with p16(INK4a) and CDH13 methylation than in those without [p16(INK4a): odds ratio (OR), 0.07; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.02-0.33; CDH13: OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.77] and the methylation index was significantly lower in EGFR mutant cases than in wild type (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.95). By contrast, K-RAS mutation was significantly higher in p16(INK4a) methylated cases than in unmethylated cases (OR, 4.93; 95% CI, 1.54-15.7) and the methylation index was higher in K-RAS mutant cases than in wild type with marginal significance (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.95-2.25). Our results indicate the differences in the evolvement of epigenetic alterations between the EGFR- and K-RAS-mediated tumorigenesis and suggest the specific interaction of genetic and epigenetic changes in tumorigenesis of lung cancer.",

Components of the G1 checkpoint, including retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, cyclin D1 and p16INK4a, are commonly altered in human malignancies, abrogating cell cycle control. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined 79 invasive transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder treated by cystectomy, for loss of Rb or p16INK4a protein and for cyclin D1 overexpression. As p53 is also involved in cell cycle control, its expression was studied as well. Rb protein loss occurred in 23/79 cases (29%); it was inversely correlated with loss of p16INK4a, which occurred in 15/79 cases (19%). One biphenotypic case, with Rb+p16- and Rb-p16+ areas, was identified as well. Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in 21/79 carcinomas (27%), all of which retained Rb protein. Fifty of 79 tumours (63%) showed aberrant accumulation of p53 protein; p53 staining did not correlate with Rb, p16INK4a, or cyclin D1 status. Overall, 70% of bladder carcinomas showed abnormalities in one or more of the intrinsic proteins of the G1 checkpoint (Rb, p16INK4a and cyclin D1). Only 15% of all bladder carcinomas (12/79) showed a normal phenotype for all four proteins. In a multivariate survival analysis, cyclin D1 overexpression was linked to less aggressive disease and relatively favourable outcome. In our series, Rb, p16INK4a and p53 status did not reach statistical significance as prognostic factors. In conclusion, G1 restriction point defects can be identified in the majority of bladder carcinomas. Our findings support the hypothesis that cyclin D1 and p16INK4a can cooperate to dysregulate the cell cycle, but that loss of Rb protein abolishes the G1 checkpoint completely, removing any selective advantage for cells that alter additional cell cycle proteins.",

When beta-actin was used as an internal control, the mRNA expression of three DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) and five MBPs (MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, MBD4, and MeCP2) was upregulated in SCLC, while only that of DNMT1, DNMT3B and MBD3 was upregulated in NSCLC, compared with normal lung tissues. However, when normalized using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an internal control, these differences disappeared or diminished; there was even a significant reduction in the expression ratios of DNMT1, MBD2 and MeCP2 in SCLC and DNMT1, MBD2 and MBD4 in NSCLC. Furthermore, although significant correlations between PCNA expression and mRNA expression levels of the three DNMTs and four of the MBPs (excluding MeCP2) were observed, there was no obvious correlation between promoter hypermethylation of these tumor suppressor genes and the expression level of any of the DNMTs or MBPs.

To investigate the role of p16INK4a in tumor suppression and the potential interaction between p16INK4a and other cellular controlling elements, such as telomerase activity and DNA repair ability, the full-length of p16INK4a cDNA was cloned into a retroviral vector and introduced into human breast cancer MCF-7 cells that were previously demonstrated to harbor homozygous deletions of the p16INK4a gene. Stable expression of p16INK4a suppressed the malignant phenotype in MCF-7 cells, including cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, and the blockage of pRB phosphorylation. In addition, expression of p16INK4a suppressed telomerase activity and restored the telomere shortening process, and decreased cell DNA repair ability and sensitized cells to the DNA damage reagent. Our data suggest that the wild-type p16INK4a plays an important role in suppression of tumor malignancy, not only by inhibiting cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but also by inhibiting other cellular controlling mechanisms, such as telomerase activity and DNA repair capacity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inverted CCAAT box-binding protein of 90 kDa (ICBP90) is over-expressed in several types of cancer, including breast, prostate and lung cancers. In search for proteins that interact with the set and ring-associated (SRA) domain of ICBP90, we used the two-hybrid system and screened a placental cDNA library. Several clones coding for a new domain of DNMT1 were found. The interaction, between the ICBP90 SRA domain and the DNMT1 domain, has been confirmed with purified proteins by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down experiments. We checked whether ICBP90 and DNMT1 are present in the same macro-molecular complexes in Jurkat cells and immortalized human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVTs-SM1). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ICBP90 and DNMT1 are present in the same molecular complex, which was further confirmed by co-localization experiments as assessed by immunocytochemistry. Downregulation of ICBP90 and DNMT1 decreased VEGF gene expression, a major pro-angiogenic factor, whereas those of p16(INK4A) gene and RB1 gene were significantly enhanced. Together, these results indicate that DNMT1 and ICBP90 are involved in VEGF gene expression, possibly via an interaction of the SRA domain of ICBP90 with a novel domain of DNMT1 and an upregulation of p16(INK4A). They further suggest a new role of ICBP90 in the relationship between histone ubiquitination and DNA methylation in the context of tumoral angiogenesis and tumour suppressor genes silencing.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a barrier for tumor development. Oncogene-dependent DNA damage and activation of the ARF/p53 pathway play a central role in OIS and, accordingly, ARF and p53 are frequently mutated in human cancer. A number of leukemia/lymphoma-initiating oncogenes, however, inhibit ARF/p53 and only infrequently select for ARF or p53 mutations, suggesting the involvement of other tumor-suppressive pathways. We report that NPM-ALK, the initiating oncogene of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs), induces DNA damage and irreversibly arrests the cell cycle of primary fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors. This effect is associated with inhibition of p53 and is caused by activation of the p16INK4a/pRb tumor-suppressive pathway. Analysis of NPM-ALK lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice showed p16INK4a-dependent accumulation of senescent cells in premalignant lesions and decreased tumor latency in the absence of p16INK4a. Accordingly, human ALCLs showed no expression of either p16INK4a or pRb. Up-regulation of the histone-demethylase Jmjd3 and de-methylation at the p16INK4a promoter contributed to the effect of NPM-ALK on p16INK4a, which was transcriptionally regulated. These data demonstrate that p16INK4a/pRb may function as an alternative pathway of oncogene-induced senescence, and suggest that the reactivation of p16INK4a expression might be a novel strategy to restore the senescence program in some tumors.",

The primary tumor showed an undifferentiated morphology with large cells and induced extensive thickening of the pleura in the right hemithorax. The Y-ML-1B cells grow as a monolayer, with a doubling time of 19 hours, and are tumorigenic in nude mice, which showed a morphology similar to the primary tumor in xenografts. Analysis of the supernatant of cell culture medium of Y-ML-1B showed elevated levels of G-CSF and other cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), consistent with the high levels detected in the patient's serum. Cytogenetic analysis revealed aneuploidy of greater than 56 in metaphases with many structural abnormalities. Mutation analysis of the tumor suppressor genes showed that Y-ML-1B is inactivated in TP53 and RASSF1A, but not in p14(ARF), p16(INK4A), or RB. Neither activating mutations of KRAS or NRAS nor amplification of MYC or MDM2 were detected. Y-ML-1B expressed N-cadherin but not E-cadherin.

Our previous study identified that the CD44+ nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) cells may be assumed as one of markers of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cancer stem cell-like cells (CSC-LCs) and Bmi-1 is overexpressed in CD44+ NPC. In the present study, we used RNA interference technology to knock down the expression of Bmi-1 in CD44+ NPC cells, and then measured the radiation response by clonogenic cell survival assay. DNA repair was monitored by γH2AX foci formation. Bmi-1 downstream relative gene and protein expression of p16, p14, p53 were assessed by western blotting and real-time PCR. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry assays. We found that Bmi-1 knockdown prolonged G1 and enhanced the radiation-induced G2/M arrest, inhibited DNA damage repair, elevated protein p16, p14 and p53 expression, leading to increased apoptosis in the radiated CD44+ cells.

The Ras association domain family 1A gene (RASSF1A) is frequently epigenetically silenced in several types of human solid tumors. In this study, we have investigated the expression and methylation status of the RASSF1A gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In two HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) RASSF1A was inactivated and treatment of these cell lines with a DNA methylation inhibitor reactivated the transcription of RASSF1A. The methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter region was analysed in 26 primary liver tissues including HCC, hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), liver fibrosis, hepatocirrhosis. Out of 15, 14 (93%) HCC were methylated at the RASSF1A CpG island and hypermethylation was independent of hepatitis virus infection. RASSF1A was also methylated in two out of two fibrosis and in three (75%) out of four cirrhosis; the latter carries an increased risk of developing HCC. Additionally, we analysed the methylation status of p16(INK4a) and other cancer-related genes in the same liver tumors. Aberrant methylation in the HCC samples was detected in 71% of samples for p16, 25% for TIMP3, 17% for PTEN, 13% for CDH1, and 7% for RARbeta2. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RASSF1A and p16(INK4a) inactivation by methylation are frequent events in hepatocellular carcinoma, but not in HCA, which is in contrast to HCC without cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, storage diseases, or genetic background. Therefore, this study gives additional evidence against a progression of adenoma to carcinoma in the liver. Thus, RASSF1A hypermethylation could be useful as a marker of malignancy and to distinguish between the distinct forms of highly differentiated liver neoplasm.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Aberrant methylation of CpG islands acquired in tumor cells in promoter regions is one method for loss of gene function. We determined the frequency of aberrant promoter methylation (referred to as methylation) of the genes retinoic acid receptor beta-2 (RARbeta), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-3), p16INK4a, O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), E-cadherin (ECAD), p14ARF, and glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) in 107 resected primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and in 104 corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues by methylation-specific PCR. Methylation in the tumor samples was detected in 40% for RARbeta, 26% for TIMP-3, 25% for p16INK4a, 21% for MGMT, 19% for DAPK, 18% for ECAD, 8% for p14ARF, and 7% for GSTP1, whereas it was not seen in the vast majority of the corresponding nonmalignant tissues. Moreover, p16INK4a methylation was correlated with loss of p16INK4a expression by immunohistochemistry. A total of 82% of the NSCLCs had methylation of at least one of these genes; 37% of the NSCLCs had one gene methylated, 22% of the NSCLCs had two genes methylated, 13% of the NSCLCs had three genes methylated, 8% of the NSCLCs had four genes methylated, and 2% of the NSCLCs had five genes methylated. Methylation of these genes was correlated with some clinicopathological characteristics of the patients. In comparing the methylation patterns of tumors and nonmalignant lung tissues from the same patients, there were many discordancies where the genes methylated in nonmalignant tissues were not methylated in the corresponding tumors. This suggests that the methylation was occurring as a preneoplastic change. We conclude that these findings confirm in a large sample that methylation is a frequent event in NSCLC, can also occur in smoking-damaged nonmalignant lung tissues, and may be the most common mechanism to inactivate cancer-related genes in NSCLC.",

Persistent infection with one of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) has been established as the cause for cervical cancer and the documentation of the prevalence of HPV types in cervical cancer in different regions of India is useful for a prevention program combining both screening and vaccination. In this study, the HPV type distribution and the frequency of p16(INK4a) immunoexpression have been determined in 125 cases of inflammatory lesions or grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 74 cases of grade 2, 72 cases of grade 3, and 113 cervical cancer cases diagnosed among women from rural Solapur and Osmanabad districts, Maharashtra. The overall prevalence of high-risk HPV was 37.6% in inflammatory lesions or grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 63.5% in grade 2, 97.2% in grade 3 and 92% in cervical cancer cases. HPV 16 and HPV 18 were detected in 80.6% of grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 86.5% of cervical cancer cases. 94.7% of the cervical cancer and 84.4% of the high grade lesions with a strong and full thickness staining for p16(INK4a) were positive for HPV infection; p16(INK4a) immunoexpression increased with worsening grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The HPV genotyping data showing a high HPV 16 and 18 prevalence in cancer specimens indicate that prophylactic HPV 16/18 vaccination would have a significant impact on the prevention of cervical cancer in India.",

However, resistance to these agents remains a significant cause of treatment failure. We previously demonstrated that inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family tumor suppressors causes antiestrogen resistance in MCF-7 cells, a widely studied model of estrogen responsive human breast cancers. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which pRb inactivation leads to antiestrogen resistance. Cdk4 and cdk2 are two key cell cycle regulators that can phosphorylate and inactivate pRb, therefore we tested whether these kinases are required in cells lacking pRb function. pRb family members were inactivated in MCF-7 cells by expressing polyomavirus large tumor antigen (PyLT), and cdk activity was inhibited using the cdk inhibitors p16(INK4A) and p21(Waf1/Cip1). Cdk4 activity was no longer required in cells lacking functional pRb, while cdk2 activity was required for proliferation in both the presence and absence of pRb function. Using inducible PyLT cell lines, we further demonstrated that pRb inactivation leads to increased cyclin A expression, cdk2 activation and proliferation in antiestrogen arrested cells. These results demonstrate that antiestrogens do not inhibit cdk2 activity or proliferation of MCF-7 cells in the absence of pRb family function, and suggest that antiestrogen resistant breast cancer cells resulting from pRb pathway inactivation would be susceptible to therapies that target cdk2.",

Serum was obtained from women who were about to undergo a breast biopsy or mastectomy at three hospitals from 1977 to 1987 in Grand Rapids, MI USA. We compared the methylation status of 12 genes in serum DNA obtained from three groups of postmenopausal women (mean age at blood collection: 63.0 y; SD 9.9; range 35-91): breast cancer cases with lymph node-positive disease (n = 241); breast cancer cases with lymph node-negative disease (n = 63); and benign breast disease control subjects (n = 234). Overall, median levels of promoter methylation were low, typically below 5%, for all genes in all study groups. For all genes, median levels of methylation were higher (by 3.3 to 47.6%) in lymph node-positive breast cancer cases than in the controls. Comparing mean methylation level between lymph-node positive cases and controls, the most statistically significant findings, after adjustment of the false-positive rate (q-value), were for TWIST (p = 0.04), SFRP1 (p = 0.16), ESR1 (p = 0.17), P16 (p = 0.19) and APC (p = 0.19). For two of these four genes (TWIST, P16), the median methylation level was also highest in lymph-node positive cases, intermediate in lymph node-negative cases and lowest in the controls. The percent of study subjects with mean methylation scores ≥ 5% was higher among lymph node-positive cases than controls for ten genes, and significantly higher for HIN1 and TWIST (22.0 vs. 12.2%, p = 0.04 and 37.9 vs. 24.5%, p = 0.004, respectively). Despite relatively consistent variation in methylation patterns among groups, these modest differences did not provide sufficient ability to distinguish between cases and controls in a clinical setting.",

Cervical Cancer (CC) has been causally linked to high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. However, host factors are important in determining the outcome of persistent HR-HPV infection as most cervical precancerous lesions containing HR-HPVs do not progress to invasive carcinomas. Increasing evidence suggests that low diet in vitamin A and their receptors participate in the development of CC. The aim of this study has been to investigate the effects of abated RARβ expression in the development of cervical premalignant lesions in 4 month-old conditional mice (RARβ(L-/L-)). Results demonstrated the development of spontaneous squamous metaplasia, inflammatory infiltrate, enhanced mitotic activity, loss of cell differentiation, as well as decreased apoptosis and p16(INK4a) protein levels in RARβ(L-/L-) mice cervix. All these changes are hallmarks of moderate dysplasia. Importantly, our results suggest that the low expression of RARβ, may induce the down regulation of p16(INK4a), chronic inflammation and decreased apoptosis and may be involved in vulnerability to HR-HPV and early stage cervical carcinogenesis.

Here, we inducibly re-expressed p16 in vivo in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer and examined the impact on these clinically relevant aspects of pancreatic cancer tumour biology. Consistent with previous work in subcutaneous xenograft models, we found p16 capable of reducing primary tumour growth. In addition, p16 restitution resulted in a marked reduction of tumour angiogenesis, largely accounted for by a p16-dependent inhibition of lymphangiogenesis. In excellent agreement with the antilymphangiogenic effect, re-expression of p16 almost completely prevented lymph node metastases of MiaPaca-2 pancreatic tumours.

We evaluated case-control association of MTHFR C677T, A1298C, and MTR A2756G polymorphisms for cases strata-defined by promoter methylation status for each of three genes, E-cadherin, p16, and RAR-beta2 in breast cancer; in addition, we evaluated case-case comparisons of the likelihood of promoter methylation in relation to genotypes using a population-based case-control study conducted in Western New York State.

We applied unordered polytomous regression and unconditional logistic regression to derive adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

There was no evidence of difference within strata defined by menopausal status, estrogen receptor status, folate intake, and lifetime alcohol consumption.

Deletion of 9p is one of the most frequent genomic alterations in bladder cancer. In addition, alterations of 9p21 and P16 are frequently seen in the epithelial cells of chronic smokers. This pilot study evaluated whether 9p21 aberrations induced by exposure in vitro to benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the metabolic product of benzo[a]pyrene, a constituent of tobacco smoke, were more common in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 61 bladder cancer patients compared to 64 matched controls. Our hypothesis was that 9p21 sensitivity to BPDE reflects the susceptibility of a specific locus to damage from carcinogens in tobacco smoke. We found that BPDE-induced chromosome band 9p21 aberrations were significantly higher in lymphocytes of bladder cancer cases (24.97 +/- 5.26 per 1,000) than in controls (20.72 +/- 4.51 per 1,000; P < 0.0001). However, no difference was observed for CEP9, a control locus. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking status, 9p BPDE sensitivity had an odds ratio (OR) of 9.01 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.75, 21.67] for bladder cancer. We further observed a gradient of elevated bladder cancer risk associated with increasing chromosomal damage. The adjusted ORs for subjects in the second, third, and highest quartiles of BPDE-induced 9p21 aberrations relative to the first quartile were 0.48 (0.04, 5.69), 5.14 (1.12, 23.59), and 21.51 (4.75, 97.34), respectively, providing increasing dose-response evidence of the locus-specific alterations. Thus, 9p21 may be a molecular target for BPDE-induced damage in bladder cancer cases.",

Recently, we have characterized the novel tumor suppressor gene RASSF1 located in this locus. The RASSF1A isoform is epigenetically inactivated in a variety of human primary tumors. In this study, we investigated the expression and methylation status of the RASSF1 gene in thyroid carcinoma. In nine thyroid cancer cell lines, the RASSF1A promoter CpG island was methylated completely, and expression was absent. Treatment of these cell lines with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the transcription of RASSF1A. The methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter was analyzed in 38 primary thyroid tumors, including 1 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 5 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 10 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 9 undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC), and 13 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In 71% of thyroid carcinomas, the RASSF1A CpG island was hypermethylated. Methylation frequency was higher in the aggressive forms of thyroid carcinoma and was found in 80% of MTC, in 78% of UTC, and in 70% of FTC, compared with 62% in the more benign PTC. RASSF1A inactivation was detected in all stages of thyroid carcinoma scored by Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification. Additionally, we analyzed the methylation frequency of the CpG island of cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) in the same thyroid tumors. The p16 gene was inactivated in 56 and 25% of cell lines and primary tumors, respectively. p16 methylation was detected in 56% of UTC, 10% of FTC, and 25% of PTC but not in MTC. In UTC, which belongs to the most aggressive carcinomas in humans, the most common combined inactivation of RASSF1A and p16 was detected. In general, 90% of tumors with p16 inactivation were also silenced for RASSF1A expression. However, RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected three times more frequently in thyroid cancers. Thus, RASSF1A inactivation may play a crucial role in the malignancy of thyroid carcinoma.",

We have employed p16 small interfering RNA (siRNA) to dissect the role of p16 in cervical carcinogenesis. Although the silencing of p16 was accompanied by the upregulation of p53, p21 and RB in the p16 siRNA-transfected cells, no significant effect on cell cycle progression was observed. When the p16 siRNA-silenced cells were subjected to DNA damage stress including ultraviolet-irradiation and cisplatin treatments, a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells could be observed in the p16-siRNA silenced cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells. Moreover, induction of apoptosis was associated with the activation of p53 through phosphorylation, and this process, when studied by gene profiling experiments, involved both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.

To study the molecular consequences of the breakpoints in this rearrangement, we used a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The 3p14 translocation breakpoint occurs within BAC RP11-795e22, which accommodates only the TAFA1 gene, a novel cysteine-rich secreted protein thought to be involved in cytokine signaling. TAFA1 is expressed in normal breast tissue, not in MCF10A, and shows differential expression in a range of breast cancer cell lines. The 9p translocation breakpoint results in a deletion of approximately 4 megabases on the derivative chromosome 9, which includes the CDKN2A (p16) gene. Array CGH and FISH analysis demonstrated that BAC 149i22, which contains the CDKN2A/B genes, is also deleted specifically on the apparently normal copy of chromosome 9, making MCF10A null for the p16/p15 genes.

Here, we used interaction mating and coprecipitation to measure interaction of seven p16 allelic variants detected in melanoma-prone pedigrees with Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). We found that most variants were deficient in interaction with Cdk4 and Cdk6. One defective variant was found both in cancer prone families and in the control population and therefore previously defined as a common polymorphism. Another variant, which is weakly linked to familial cancer, is only slightly affected in interaction with Cdks. These results are consistent with the idea that p16 allelic variants that decrease Cdk interaction predispose individuals who carry them to an increased risk of cancer.

These levels then were compared with 25 cases of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).;In prostatic carcinoma specimens, p16 protein was elevated significantly compared with BPH, with a median fluorescence index (FI) of 15.4 versus 10.7, respectively (P = 0.010). This was not the case for CDK4 protein, although p16 protein expression correlated significantly with CDK4 protein expression in BPH (Spearman rank correlation [R(S)] = 0.63) and carcinoma (R(S) = 0.78). In univariate survival analysis of the first 5 years, high levels of p16 protein expression (FI > 11.7) (P = 0.005), tumor greatest dimension, World Health Organization (WHO) histologic grade, capsular penetration, seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, lymph node involvement, and preoperative serum prostate specific antigen > 20 ng/mL all were significant predictors of biochemical failure. In multivariate survival analysis, high p16 protein expression (P = 0.015), age, WHO histologic grade, capsular penetration, and seminal vesicle involvement remained as independent predictors of biochemical failure.;These data suggest that increased expression of p16 protein, but not CDK4 protein, may be involved in the development of prostate carcinoma and may represent an independent predictor of biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.",

Mice lacking ARF are highly prone to tumor development, and in this study, 80% of these animals spontaneously developed tumors and died within their first year of life. Mice that were heterozygous for ARF also developed tumors after a longer latency, whereas their wild-type littermates did not. In heterozygotes, tumor formation was accompanied by loss of the residual ARF allele and/or lack of ARF mRNA expression, implying that ARF can act as a canonical \"two-hit\" tumor suppressor gene. Tumors occurred earlier in life in ARF-null animals that were neonatally irradiated or given dimethylbenzanthrene, and several animals treated with carcinogen simultaneously developed multiple forms of malignancy arising from distinct cell lineages. Although p53-null mice primarily develop lymphomas and fibrosarcomas, the frequency of these two tumor types was inverted in ARF-null animals, with undifferentiated sarcomas predominating in a 3:2 ratio; 28% of ARF-null animals developed carcinomas and tumors of the nervous system, which have been rarely observed in untreated p53-null mice.

Quantitative methylation-specific PCR analysis showed a significant increase in promoter hypermethylation of p16 and CDH1 in OSCC tumors relative to paired non-tumorous tissues. The mean age of patients with hypermethylated p16 was lesser than those without (P=0.027). Multiple logistic regression predicted patients with hypermethylated p16 have higher risks of lymph node invasion (adjusted OR=6.21, P=0.030) in young patients and distant metastasis (adjusted OR=19.23, P=0.007) in older patients. Moreover, p16 promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with shortened disease-free survival (P=0.034) in older patients. Our results suggested that p16 hypermethylation was associated with early incidence of OSCC, increased lymph node invasion in young patients, and poor prognosis in older patients.

However, a new class of non-APC mutated CRCs has been defined that have a serrated histopathology and carry the (V600E)BRAF oncogene. Here we have investigated the pathogenesis of serrated CRCs by expressing (V600E)Braf in the proliferative cells of the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We show that the oncogene drives an initial burst of Mek-dependent proliferation, leading to the formation of hyperplastic crypts. This is associated with β-catenin nuclear localization by a mechanism involving Mapk/Erk kinase (Mek)-dependent, Akt-independent phosphorylation of Gsk3β. However, hyperplastic crypts remain dormant for prolonged periods due to the induction of crypt senescence accompanied by upregulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and p16(Ink4a). We show that tumour progression is associated with down-regulation of p16(Ink4a) through enhanced CpG methylation of exon 1 and knockout of Cdkn2a confirms this gene is a barrier to tumour progression. Our studies identify (V600E)BRAF as an early genetic driver mutation in serrated CRCs and indicate that, unlike APC-mutated cancers, this subtype arises by the bypassing of a (V600E)Braf driven oncogene-induced senescence programme.",

Chromosomal changes were compared between the two cell lines by routine G-banded chromosome analyses and both regular and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. After 3 months of exposure to genistein, the cell line MCF-10A/G1 showed loss of a normal chromosome 8 and gain of an extra chromosome 20, as well as loss of a chromosomal segment on the short arm of chromosome 9, leading to a homozygous deletion of the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A (alias p16(INK4a)) and CDKN2B (alias p15(INK4b)).

We have generated transgenic mice expressing the nasopharyngeal carcinoma-derived CAO strain of LMP1 and LMP1 of the B95-8 strain, using the viral ED-L2 promoter for epithelial expression. LMP1(CAO) and LMP1(B95-8) induce transforming growth factor alpha expression and epidermal hyperplasia. However, levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) decline with the appearance of phosphorylated EGFR products, suggesting that the negative feedback loop upon EGFR expression is intact or that there is faster turnover at these early stages of carcinogenesis. In the L2LMP1(CAO) mice, increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor are also seen at an early stage in the skin. As the phenotype worsens, with increasing hyperplasia and vascularization leading to keratoacanthoma, p16(INK4a) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression is induced. The lesions can progress spontaneously to carcinoma. Carcinoma cell lines developed from these mice show high levels of total and phosphorylated EGFR. These data show that the induction of signaling through EGFR by LMP1 is an early event in carcinogenesis and that any inhibition upon EGFR expression is lifted during progression. Furthermore, expression of LMP1 is not sufficient to inhibit induction of p16(INK4a) in response to abnormal proliferation. These data are consistent with the cooperative effects seen between LMP1 and loss of the INK4a locus in transgenic mice and with the frequency of loss of this locus in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

This study aimed to examine the mechanisms of inactivation of the CDKN2A gene and correlate the results with clinicopathological features.;Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction was used to detect CDKN2A promoter methylation in gastric adenocarcinomas from American patients. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the loss of the p16 protein and in situ hybridisation was used to detect the presence of EBV. The tumours were also analysed for the presence of microsatellite instability.;Eleven (10%) of 107 tumours harboured EBV in the malignant cells. In gastric cancers without EBV, 32% exhibited CDKN2A promoter methylation and 26% had p16 protein loss. In contrast, 91% of the tumours containing EBV had CDKN2A promoter methylation (p = 0.0003) and 90% showed p16 protein loss (p = 0.0001). The presence of EBV was also associated with male sex (p = 0.03) and was more common in tumours from Texas Hispanics than from non-Hispanic whites or African-Americans (p = 0.01). EBV was not associated with microsatellite instability, histological subtype, stage, or grade of the tumour, or age or survival time of the patient.;The presence of EBV in gastric adenocarcinomas is strongly associated with CDKN2A inactivation by promoter methylation. In addition, these findings suggest that there are ethnic differences in tumour virology and pathogenesis.",

No molecular markers of PC progression or outcome with proven clinical utility have been described. Because the loss of normal cell cycle control is an early event in the evolution of cancer, we sought to determine whether changes in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16INK4A, predicted outcome in this disease. We screened a cohort of 206 patients with clinically localized PC treated with radical prostatectomy for overexpression of the INK4A gene, the product of which inactivates the G1-phase cyclin dependent kinases, Cdk4 and Cdk6. p16INK4A protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in areas of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), a precursor to invasive disease, and of cancer in the same specimen. Data were evaluated for disease relapse using the Kaplan-Meier method and in a Cox proportional hazards model by assessing p16INK4A status in areas of HGPIN and cancer with other variables of known clinical relevance. Overexpression of p16INK4A in HGPIN and cancer was correlated with, but independent of, pathological stage and was associated with early relapse in PC patients treated with radical prostatectomy (log-rank test, P < 0.001). In a multivariate model adjusted for Gleason grade, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen levels, pathological stage, and margin status, overexpression of p16INK4A in HGPIN was an independent predictor of disease relapse and increased the risk of recurrence 2.24-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.93). These data provide the first evidence for a prognostic marker in HGPIN. The clinical utility of p16INK4A status in stratifying patients for aggressive treatment very early in the disease process, potentially several years prior to the onset of invasive disease, requires further investigation.",

Chemoprevention with dietary compounds and their synthetic analogs has emerged as an attractive strategy to prevent carcinogenic progression to invasive cancer. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of some new synthetic derivatives of berberine, a phytochemical isolated from Barberry and other plants, to induce growth arrest of HER-2/neu overexpressing SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. Supplementation with berberine or with the synthetic derivatives NAX012, NAX013, NAX014, and NAX035 exerted a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of SK-BR-3 cell viability, with a greater effectiveness of NAX012 and NAX014 compounds with respect to berberine. This cytotoxic effect was related to an increased number of apoptotic cells that reached 71.6% and 68.4% after 72 h treatment with 50 µM of NAX012 and NAX014, respectively, compared with 44.2% of berberine. Real-time PCR analyses showed that berberine, NAX012 and NAX014 compounds increased the expression of some cell-cycle checkpoint molecules involved in cell senescence such as p53, p21(WAF1) , p16(INK4a) , and PAI-1, already after 24 h of 50 µM treatments. Furthermore, berberine, NAX012 and NAX014, all reduced both HER-2/neu expression and phosphorylation on tumor cells, the NAX014 compound showing the higher effectiveness. These results provide novel information on the mechanisms involved in the anticancer effects of berberine and demonstrate the greater effectiveness of NAX012 and NAX014 analogs in inducing apoptosis and cellular senescence in HER-2/neu overexpressing tumor cell lines.",

Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing lacks specificity as a primary screening method. Studies indicate that immunocytochemical detection of alterations caused by HPV in the host cells can optimise screening. Here, the potential of p16(INK4a) (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16) and MIB-1 (Ki-67 proliferation marker) as adjunct molecular markers for cervical lesions was investigated in a prospective, cross-sectional study of 500 samples in the framework of opportunistic screening in Flanders, Belgium. A consecutive series of 200 samples and 100 samples from the cytological categories ASC, LSIL and HSIL were investigated. Surepath samples were interpreted according to the Bethesda 2001 reporting system. HPV testing was done with MY09/MY11 consensus PCR. Immunocytochemistry for p16(INK4a) and MIB-1 was performed with an automated staining protocol. The number of immunoreactive cells/1,000 cervical cells was assessed. There was a higher mean number of p16(INK4A) and MIB-1 immunoreactive cells/1,000 cells in HSIL (4.06 +/- 1.93 and 11.13 +/- 2.83, respectively) compared to other cytological categories. Both markers showed a large spread in counts, for all categories. In cases of HSIL without immunoreactive cells for either marker, low cellularity and long-term storage in water were often the cause of false negativity. This study confirms that positive staining for p16(INK4a) and MIB-1 is highly correlated with presence of high-grade lesions. These markers could be used as adjuncts to increase the sensitivity of cytological screening as well as the specificity of the HPV test. However, clear methodological standards are needed for optimal performance of immunocytochemistry in a clinical setting.",

There is no resemblance between the two proteins: their coding regions are assembled by alternative splicing of two mutually exclusive 5' exons into a constitutive one containing overlapping out-of-phase reading frames. We show that the dual-coding arrangement conflicts with the high cost of mutations within INK4a/ARF. Unexpectedly, the locus evolves rapidly and asymmetrically, with ARF accumulating the majority of amino acid replacements. Rapid evolution drives both INK4a and ARF proteins out of sync with other members of the RB and p53 tumor suppressor pathways, both of which are controlled by the locus. Yet, the asymmetric behavior may be an intrinsic property of dual-coding exons: INK4a/ARF closely mimics the evolution of 90 newly identified genes with similar dual-coding structure. Thus, the strong link between mutations in INK4a/ARF and cancer may be a direct consequence of the architecture of the locus.",

The results indicated that SAM treatment inhibited cell growth in gastric cancer cells and colon cancer cells, and the inhibition efficiency was significantly higher than that in the normal cells. Under standard growth conditions, C-myc and H-ras promoters were hypomethylated in gastric cancer cells and colon cancer cells. SAM treatment resulted in a heavy methylation of these promoters, which consequently downregulated mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, there was no significant difference in mRNA and protein levels of p16 (INK4a) with and without SAM treatment. SAM can effectively inhibit the tumor cells growth by reversing the DNA hypomethylation on promoters of oncogenes, thus down-regulating their expression. With no influence on the expression of the tumor suppressor genes, such as P16, SAM could be used as a potential drug for cancer therapy.",

Although malignant mesothelioma (MM) has been demonstrated to be clearly correlated with asbestos exposure, it remains poorly understood how asbestos fibers confer key gene alterations and induce cellular transformation in normal mesothelial cells, which results in the acquisition of malignant phenotypes, including deregulated cell proliferation and invasion. Malignant mesothelioma presents with the frequent inactivation of tumor suppressor genes of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) on chromosome 9p21 and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) on chromosome 22q12, with the latter being responsible for the NF2 familial cancer syndrome. In contrast, MM shows infrequent mutation of the p53 gene, which is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human malignancies. Genetic abnormalities of oncogenes have also been studied in MM, but no frequent mutations have been identified, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and K-RAS genes. Recent studies have suggested the activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases, including Met, and the deregulations of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling cascades, although the alterations responsible for their activation are still not clear. Thus, further genome-wide studies of genetic and epigenetic alterations as well as detailed analyses of deregulated signaling cascades in MM are necessary to determine the molecular mechanisms of MM, which would also provide some clues for establishing a new molecular target therapy for MM.",

We evaluated the association between major clinicopathological features and hypermethylation of genes in tumors among 803 incidence breast cancer cases from a large population-based case-control study conducted in Western New York State. DNA samples were isolated from archive paraffin embedded tumor tissue and were analyzed for hypermethylation status of the E-cadherin, p16, and RAR-beta(2) genes using real time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The frequencies of hypermethylation were 20.0% for E-cadherin, 25.9% for p16, and 27.5% for RAR-beta(2) genes. For postmenopausal women, hypermethylation of E-cadherin tended to be more likely in progesterone receptor (PR) negative than in PR-positive tumors (odds ratio (OR), 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.91-2.18). Hypermethylation of p16 tended to be more frequent among estrogen receptor (ER) negative cases than ER-positive cases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.32). Hypermethylation of RAR-beta(2) gene was inversely associated with histological and nuclear grade of breast cancer.",

Recent studies have led to an understanding of additional biologic functions for p16; however, the detailed mechanisms involved are still elusive. In this article, we show an unexpected expression of anion exchanger 1 (AE1) in the cytoplasm in poorly and moderately differentiated gastric and colonic adenocarcinoma cells and in its interaction with p16, thereby sequestrating the protein in the cytoplasm. Genetic alterations of p16 and AE1 were not detectable. Forced expression of AE1 in these cells sequestrated more p16 in the cytoplasm, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of AE1 in the cells induced the release of p16 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, leading to cell death and growth inhibition of tumor cells. By analyzing tissue samples obtained from patients with gastric and colonic cancers, we found that 83.33% of gastric cancers and 56.52% of colonic cancers coexpressed AE1 and p16 in the cytoplasm. We conclude that AE1 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of gastric and colonic adenocarcinoma and that p16 dysfunction is a novel pathway of carcinogenesis.",

Here, we examined the oncogenic potential of Bmi-1 in MCF10A cells, a spontaneously immortalized, nontransformed strain of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Bmi-1 overexpression alone in MCF10A cells did not result in oncogenic transformation. However, Bmi-1 co-overexpression with activated H-Ras (RasG12V) resulted in efficient transformation of MCF10A cells in vitro. Although early-passage H-Ras-expressing MCF10A cells were not transformed, late-passage H-Ras-expressing cells exhibited features of transformation in vitro. Early- and late-passage H-Ras-expressing cells also differed in levels of expression of H-Ras and Ki-67, a marker of proliferation. Subsets of early-passage H-Ras-expressing cells exhibited high Ras expression and were negative for Ki-67, whereas most late-passage H-Ras-expressing cells expressed low levels of Ras and were Ki-67 positive. Injection of late-passage H-Ras-expressing cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice formed carcinomas with leiomatous, hemangiomatous, and mast cell components; these tumors were quite distinct from those induced by late-passage cells co-overexpressing Bmi-1 and H-Ras, which formed poorly differentiated carcinomas with spindle cell features. Bmi-1 and H-Ras co-overexpression in MCF10A cells also induced features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Importantly, Bmi-1 inhibited senescence and permitted proliferation of cells expressing high levels of Ras.

The 156 amino acid residue protein is composed of four ankyrin repeats (a helix-turn-helix motif) that stack linearly as two four-helix bundles resulting in a non-globular, elongated molecule. The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the folding of p16 are unusual. The protein has a very low free energy of unfolding, Delta GH-2O/D-N, of 3.1 kcal mol-1 at 25 degreesC. The rate-determining transition state of folding/unfolding is very compact (89% as compact as the native state). The other unusual feature is the very rapid rate of unfolding in the absence of denaturant of 0.8 s-1 at 25 degreesC. Thus, p16 has both thermodynamic and kinetic instability. These features may be essential for the regulatory function of the INK4 proteins and of other ankyrin-repeat-containing proteins that mediate a wide range of protein-protein interactions. The mechanisms of inactivation of p16 by eight cancer-associated mutations were dissected using a systematic method designed to probe the integrity of the secondary structure and the global fold. The structure and folding of p16 appear to be highly vulnerable to single point mutations, probably as a result of the protein's low stability.

        "Doc_abstract":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common disease in Hong Kong and southern provinces of China. EBV infection is believed to play a critical role in the development of NPC. Previous studies on the transformation mechanism of EBV genes were mostly performed in either NPC or nonnasopharyngeal epithelial cells which may not be representative of premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Establishment of a representative cell system would greatly facilitate the elucidation of the role of EBV infection in the development of NPC. Using telomerase alone, we were able to establish an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line from primary nonmalignant nasopharyngeal biopsies. The telomerase-immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells are largely diploid in karyotype. Interestingly, this newly immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line, referred as NP460hTert, harbors genetic alterations previously identified in premalignant and malignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. These include inactivation of p16 by homozygous deletion of the p16(INK4A) locus and downregulation of RASSF1A expression. The deletion of the p16(INK4A) locus appears to be the most crucial event for the immortalization of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells by telomerase and precedes RASSF1A downregulation. In addition, detailed analysis of the cytogenetic changes by conventional cytogenetics, spectral karyotyping (SKY) and array-based CGH revealed a gain of a 17q21-q25 fragment on 11p15 chromosome in all NP460hTert cells which occurred before deletion of the p16(INK4A) locus. Gain of 17q has been previously reported in NPC. In addition, activation of NF-kappaB was observed in immortalized NP460hTert cells at the later population doublings, and may play a role in the survival of immortalized NP epithelial cells. Id1 which is commonly expressed in various human cancers, including NPC, was also upregulated in the immortalized NP460hTert cells. Thus, the establishment of an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line harboring common genetic alterations present in premalignant and cancerous nasopharyngeal epithelial cells may provide a valuable cell system to examine for early events involved in NPC carcinogenesis, particularly in elucidating the role of EBV infection in NPC development.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This investigation is the first to evaluate simultaneously human papilloma virus (HPV) status, p16(INK4a), and p53 immunoreactivity in epithelial ovarian neoplasms. The results were analyzed and correlated with histological type, histological grade, and survival of patients. Subtypes considered are papillary serous and mucinous. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, performed in our previous study, had already demonstrated a small number of HPV-positive epithelial ovarian neoplasms. No significant correlation was found between the presence of HPV DNA and subtypes of ovarian neoplasms; thus, HPV cannot be considered responsible for epithelial ovarian neoplasm. Since p16 immunoreactivity was present in many other HPV-negative cases of epithelial ovarian neoplasms, this study suggests that p16 overexpression in some neoplasms of the female genital tract is not related to HPV carcinogenesis. A higher p53 expression rate observed between borderline and malignant serous tumors and between serous and mucinous neoplasms can confirm a recent dualistic model of ovarian carcinogenesis. According to this theory, low-grade serous carcinomas (serous intraepithelial carcinomas, serous borderline neoplasm, and ovarian mucinous neoplasms) (type I tumors) develop from mutations of KAS and BRAF, while high-grade serous carcinomas (type II tumors) develop from mutation of p53. In malignant neoplasms, for univariate analysis, patient survival seems to be related to p53, strong and diffuse p16 overexpression, and the stage of development of neoplasms at the diagnosis. In multinomial logistic regression, used to evaluate the role of staging, grading, p16 and p53 immunopositivity as predictor variables of unfavorable outcome of the disease, only p16 positivity was significantly related to the poor prognosis of the cancer.",

Due to the above findings we started performing the cheap and quick large scale testing for BRCA1 mutations and, these days, we have almost 4,000 carriers diagnosed and under direct or indirect supervision what is probably the largest number in the world. Additionally, the above results pushed us to hypothesize that genetic homogeneity will be seen in Poland in studies of other genes. Actually, the next studies allowed us to identify genes / changes associated with moderate / low breast cancer risk and showed, similarly to BRCA1, high level of genetic homogeneity. This series included BRCA2, C5972T, CHEK2 del5395; 1100delC, I157T or IVS2 + 1G > A, CDKN2A (p16) A148T, XPD Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln, CYP1B1 R48G, A119S and L43V. The results of the above studies led us in 2004 already to hypothesize that >90% of all cancers have genetic (constitutional) background. Two years later we were able to show a panel of markers covering 92% of consecutive breast cancers in Poland, and we formulated the hypothesis that all cancers have a genetic background. These days we are demonstrating for the first time that genetic components to malignancy play a role in all cancers. We are presenting it on examples of late-onset breast cancers from Poland, but it seems to be justified to expect that similar results can be achieved from other malignancies.",

Biopsies were analyzed using RT-PCR in 52 patients with lung cancer and 19 patients with benign lung disease. The results showed that the detection rates of FHIT and p16 gene transcript deletion were significantly higher in lung cancer patients than in patients with benign lung disease (65.4% versus 10.5%, p=0.001 and 59.6% versus 5.3%, p<0.001, respectively). The sensitivities for detecting FHIT and p16 transcript deletion in biopsies were 65.4% and 59.6% (combined 80.8%), respectively, which were markedly better than those of histology and cytology (42.3% and 34.6%, respectively; combined 57.7%). In 22 lung cancer patients with negative histology and cytology at initial bronchoscopy, FHIT and p16 mRNA loss was detected in 40.9% (9/22) and 36.4% (8/22) cases, respectively. FHIT mRNA loss was associated with smoking status in lung cancer patients. In conclusion, deletion of FHIT and p16 mRNA can be identified in biopsies obtained during bronchoscopic procedures. FHIT and p16 mRNA deletion can be used as biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer and may serve as adjuncts to histology and cytology in lung cancer diagnosis. ",

Homozygous mutations, in mice, are embryonic lethal while heterozygous mutations result in perturbed mammary gland development. In humans, mutations that result in the haploinsufficiency of TBX3 causes Ulnar Mammary Syndrome (UMS) characterized by mammary gland hypoplasia as well as other congenital defects. In addition to its role in mammary gland development, various studies have also supported a role for Tbx3 in breast cancer development. TBX3 is over-expressed in various breast cancer cell lines as well as cancer tissue and has been found to contribute to breast cancer cell migration. Previous studies have suggested that TBX3 contributes to cancer development by its ability to bypass senescence by repressing the expression of p14(ARF)-tumor suppressor. Although many studies have shown that a dysregulation of TBX3 expression may contribute to cancer progression, no direct evidence shows TBX3 causes breast cancer.;In this study, we created doxycycline inducible double transgenic mice (MMTV-rtTA;tet-myc-TBX3-IRES-Luciferase) to test whether TBX3 over-expression can induce tumor formation within the mammary gland. Although over-expression of TBX3, alone, did not induce tumor formation it did promote accelerated mammary gland development by increasing mammary epithelial cell proliferation. We also show that TBX3 directly binds to and represses NFκBIB, an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway known to play a role in regulating cell proliferation. Lastly, we also show that the over-expression of TBX3 is associated with an increase in mammary stem-like cells.;Overall, our data suggests that over-expression of TBX3 may contribute to breast cancer development by promoting accelerated mammary gland development through the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and stimulation of both mammary epithelial cell and stem-like cell proliferation.",

The objective of the current study was to assess how the p53 apoptotic pathway is altered in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), especially in tumors without p53 alterations.;p53, its upstream regulators (p14(ARF) and HDM2), and downstream effectors of the apoptotic pathway (BAX and BCL2) were studied in 118 NSCLC specimens. p53 was analyzed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis covering exons 2-11 and by immunohistochemistry (IHC). p14(ARF) was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and IHC. HDM2 was analyzed using Southern blot analysis and IHC. BAX and BCL2 were analyzed by IHC. Two other upstream regulators that regulate the stability of HDM2, PTEN and HAUSP, also were studied.;Of 118 NSCLC specimens that were analyzed, p53 alterations were detected in 74 tumors (63%), p14(ARF) inactivation was detected in 53 tumors (45%), and overexpression of HDM2 was found in 31 tumors (26%), including 6 tumors with gene amplification. Although p53 inactivation and HDM2 overexpression were detected simultaneously, HDM2 gene amplification was observed only in tumor specimens without p53 mutations. IHC revealed PTEN down-regulation in 22 of 88 tumors (25%). HAUSP Northern blot analysis demonstrated several-fold differences in gene expression that did not correlate with p53 alterations. Of 118 NSCLC specimens, expression of BAX and BCL2 expression were detected in 46 tumors (39%) and 17 tumors (14%), respectively. Finally, ASPP1 and ASPP2, molecules involved in mediating the transcription function of p53, were not found to be aberrantly expressed when tested by Northern blot analysis.;Overall, two or more p53 pathway components were found to be frequently altered in patients with NSCLC. Greater than 90% of the alterations were due to abnormalities of p53, p14(ARF), or HDM2. Therefore, the inactivation of one or more components of the p53 pathway appears to be a prerequisite for the development of most NSCLCs.",

Kidney tumors are heterogeneous in their histology, genetics, and clinical behavior. To gain insight into the role of epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor and cancer genes in kidney tumorigenesis, we determined a hypermethylation profile of kidney cancer.;We examined the promoter methylation status of 10 biologically significant tumor suppressor and cancer genes in 100 kidney tumors (50 clear cell, 20 papillary, 6 chromophobe, 5 collecting duct, 5 renal cell unclassified, 7 oncocytoma, 6 transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis, and 1 Wilms' tumor) by methylation-specific PCR. The hypermethylation profile was examined with regard to clinicopathological characteristics of the kidney cancer patients.;Hypermethylation of one or more genes was found in 93 (93%) of 100 tumors. A total of 33% of kidney tumors had one gene, 35% two genes, 14% three genes, and 11% four or more genes hypermethylated. The frequency of hypermethylation of the 10 genes in the 100 tumor DNAs was VHL 8% (all clear cell), p16(INK4a) 10%, p14(ARF) 17%, APC 14%, MGMT 7%, GSTP1 12%, RARbeta2 12%, RASSF1A 45%, E-cadherin 11%, and Timp-3 58%. Hypermethylation was observed in all of the histological cell types and grades and stages examined. No hypermethylation was observed in specimens of normal kidney or ureteral tissue from 15 patients. Hypermethylation of VHL was specific to clear cell tumors. RASSF1A methylation was detected at a significantly higher frequency in papillary renal cell tumors and in high-grade tumors of all cell types. MGMT methylation was more frequent in nonsmokers. Simultaneous methylation of five or more genes was observed in 3 (3%) of 100 tumors and may indicate a methylator phenotype in kidney cancer. In addition, the CpG island in the promoter of the fumarate hydratase (FH) tumor suppressor gene was bisulfite sequenced and was found to be unmethylated in 15 papillary renal tumors.;Promoter hypermethylation is common, can occur relatively early, may disrupt critical pathways, and, thus, likely plays an important role in kidney tumorigenesis. A hypermethylation profile may be useful in predicting a patient's clinical outcome and provide molecular markers for diagnostic and prognostic approaches to kidney cancer.",

Previous studies showed that oncogene-induced aberrant proliferation, such as on cyclin E overexpression, causes DNA damage and checkpoint activation. Here, we show that, in a series of human colorectal adenomas, those with deregulation of cyclin D1 and/or p16(Ink4a) showed little evidence of constitutive DNA damage response (DDR), contrary to cyclin E-overexpressing higher-grade cases. These observations were consistent with diverse cell culture models with differential defects of retinoblastoma pathway components, as overexpression of cyclin D1 or lack of p16(Ink4a), either alone or combined, did not elicit detectable DDR. In contrast, inactivation of pRb, the key component of the pathway, activated the DDR in cultured human or mouse cells, analogous to elevated cyclin E. These results highlight differential effect of diverse oncogenic events on driving the 'cancer cell cycles' and their ability to deregulate the replication-driving CDK2 kinase and to alarm the DDR as a potential anticancer barrier in accordance with their hierarchical positions along the retinoblastoma pathway. Our data provide new insights into oncogene-evoked DDR in human tumorigenesis, with potential implications for individualized management of tumors with elevated cyclin D1 versus cyclin E, due to their distinct clinical variables and biological behavior.",

The authors used single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to compare overall copy number aberrations (CNAs) as well as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the entire human genome in ER-positive and ER-negative breast carcinomas.;DNA was extracted from frozen tumor sections of 21 breast carcinoma specimens and analyzed with a proprietary 50K XbaI SNP array. Copy number and LOH probability values were derived for each sample. Data were analyzed using bioinformatics and computational software, and permutation tests were used to estimate the significance of these values.;There was a global increase in CNAs and LOH in ER-negative relative to ER-positive cancers. Gain of the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q) and 8q were the most obvious changes common in both subtypes: An increase in the chromosome 1 short arm (1p)/1q ratio was observed in ER-negative samples, and an increased 16p/16q ratio was observed in ER-positive samples. Significant CNAs (adjusted P<.05) in ER-negative relative to ER-positive tumors included 5q deletion, loss of 15q, and gain of 2p and 21q. Copy-neutral LOH (cnLOH) common to both ER-positive and ER-negative samples included 9p21, the p16 tumor suppressor locus, and 4q13, the RCHY1 (ring finger and CHY zinc finger domain-containing 1) oncogene locus. Of particular interest was an enrichment of 17q LOH among the ER-negative tumors, potentially suggesting breast cancer 1 gene (BRCA1) mutations.;SNP array detected both genetic imbalances and cnLOH and was capable of discriminating ER-negative breast cancer from ER-positive breast cancer.",

However, only a few reports have addressed the issue of simultaneously occurring abnormalities of Rb-pathway components in malignant endometrial tumors.;Currently, we assessed the expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins (pRb, cyclin D1, p16(INK4A) and cdk4) in 48 sporadic endometrial cancers, and investigated these tumors for a possible relationship between aberrant protein staining and clinicopathological variables of cancer and RB-LOH.;There was abnormal pRb, cyclin D1, p16(INK4A) and cdk4 immunoreactivity in 2%, 50%, 6% and 25% of cases, respectively. Altogether, 33 of 48 (69%) endometrial malignant tumors showed abnormal expression of at least one Rb-pathway protein immunohistochemically. However, there was significant correlation neither between the cell-cycle regulators nor between the frequency of pRb, p16(INK4A) and cyclin D1 abnormalities and clinicopathological variables of cancer, but a significant correlation did exist between cdk4 staining and the clinical stage of disease ( P<0.05, Fisher's exact test). Moreover, an inverse relationship was also demonstrated between cdk4 expression and patient age ( r=-0.367; P=0.01). However, none of the cell-cycle regulatory proteins, except for pRb, was related to loss of heterozygosity at locus 13q14.;As a conclusion, derailments of the Rb-pathway components, cyclin D1 and cdk4 in particular, seems to participate in the endometrial cancer development in humans. Overexpression of cdk4 was related to the progression of neoplastic disease and corresponds with age of onset, suggesting a major role of altered cdk4 immunoreactivity in the progression of endometrial cancer.",

Polymerase chain reaction analysis, using general primers, was performed for human papillomavirus analysis.

The aim of this study is to relate the pattern of expression of multiple cancer genes known to undergo epigenetic inactivation by promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer with histologic and outcome data. We used immunohistochemistry to study expression of the tumor suppressor gene p16, estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, ERbeta, progesterone receptor (PR), and the DNA repair gene MGMT (O6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) in a panel of 200 breast cancers. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm MGMT promoter methylation. Loss of expression of MGMT, ERalpha, ERbeta, PR, and p16 was observed in 19%, 24%, 13%, 40%, and 50% of cases, respectively. A significant correlation was seen between grade III tumor and loss of expression of ERalpha, ERbeta, PR (all P < .0001), and MGMT (P = .04), whereas loss of expression of p16 was associated with grades I and II tumors (P < .001). Cases that expressed 3 or less of the 5 proteins studied had significantly reduced survival (P = .0016). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in a subset of 20 cancers showed DNA methylation associated with the loss of MGMT expression (P < .001). In conclusion, there is silencing of several key genes in breast cancer affecting molecular pathways involved in cell immortalization, DNA repair, and hormonal regulation, and this correlates significantly with risk of cancer-specific death. This expression profile could be linked to epigenetic events, and if so, these pathways have potential as targets for therapeutic strategies based on reversal of epigenetic silencing.",

In order to gain insight into the biological function of Mts1, its expression was monitored throughout mouse embryogenesis as well as in normal adult mouse tissues. In situ hybridizations of mouse embryos showed expression of mts1 mRNA to be highest in trophoblast cells of a day 8 old embryo. In normal adult mouse tissues, immunocytochemistry revealed Mts1 expression in a T-cell specific pattern in both the thymus and spleen. These results indicate that the expression of mts1 is prevalent in motile cell types, and to further elucidate the role of Mts1, gel overlay and GST-fusion protein experiments were performed to identify proteins that interact with the Mts1 protein.

Therefore, targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting tumor cells. To this end, we investigated the effect of the natural and pharmacologically safe molecule, caffeine, on CAF cells and their various procarcinogenic effects.;We have shown here that caffeine up-regulates the tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1, and reduces the expression/secretion of various cytokines (IL-6, TGF-β, SDF-1 and MMP-2), and down-regulates α-SMA. Furthermore, caffeine suppressed the migratory/invasiveness abilities of CAF cells through PTEN-dependent Akt/Erk1/2 inactivation. Moreover, caffeine reduced the paracrine pro-invasion/-migration effects of CAF cells on breast cancer cells. These results indicate that caffeine can inactivate breast stromal myofibroblasts. This has been confirmed by showing that caffeine also suppresses the paracrine pro-angiogenic effect of CAF cells through down-regulating HIF-1αand its downstream effector VEGF-A. Interestingly, these effects were sustained in absence of caffeine.;The present findings provide a proof of principle that breast cancer myofibroblasts can be inactivated, and thereby caffeine may provide a safe and effective prevention against breast tumor growth/recurrence through inhibition of the procarcinogenic effects of active stromal fibroblasts.",

In human breast cancer cells with Her-2/neu overexpression, which usually are more resistance to anti-cancer drugs than cells without Her-2/ neu overexpression, may be sensitized through E1A-mediated downregulation of Her-2/neu. Alternatively, E1A can induce sensitization to anticancer drugs in cancer cells or normal diploid fibroblast cells through upregulating the expression of caspase proenzymes, or downregulating the activity of a critical survival factor Akt and/or upregulating the activities of a pro-apoptotic kinase p38 and a protein phosphatase PP2A, etc. This review summarizes these progresses and proposes a plausible feed-forward model for E1A-mediated chemosensitization in human breast cancer cells.",

We used real-time methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to examine density of p16 methylation, and immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis to determine p16 protein expression.

Real-time MSP showed that CRC tissues had a wide variety in methylation density (methylation index: 0.28-0.91) and that highly methylated CRC tissues displayed significantly lower p16 mRNA expression than those with no-methylation or low-methylation. Immunohistochemistry showed that the majority of CRCs (53 of 55: 96.4%) overexpressed the p16 protein. Low p16 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (p=0.003) and large tumor size (p=0.048). Western blot in a subset of non-tumor and tumor samples showed a consistent overexpression of the p16 protein.

Importantly, Bmi-1 was also found to be overexpressed in 29 of 75 nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumors (38.7%) by immunohistochemical analysis. In contrast to nasopharyngeal carcinoma, there was no detectable expression of Bmi-1 in noncancerous nasopharyngeal epithelium. Moreover, high Bmi-1 expression positively correlated with poor prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. We also report that the overexpression of Bmi-1 leads to bypass of senescence and immortalization of NPECs, which normally express p16(INK4a) and exhibit finite replicative life span. Overexpression of Bmi-1 in NPECs led to the induction of human telomerase reverse transcriptase activity and reduction of p16(INK4a) expression. Mutational analysis of Bmi-1 showed that both RING finger and helix-turn-helix domains of it are required for immortalization of NPECs.

Several investigation methods used for the prevention and early detection strategies have specific limitations. More recently, epigenetic changes have been considered one of the most promising tools for the early diagnosis of cancer. Some of these epigenetic alterations including promoter hypermethylation of genes like P16INK4a, BRCA1, BRCA2, ERα and RARβ2, APC, and RASSF1A have been associated with early stages of mammary gland tumorigenesis and have been suggested to be included in the models that evaluate individual breast cancer risk. In lung cancer, P16INK4a and MGMT gene hypermethylation was observed in sputum years before clinical manifestation of the squamous cell carcinoma among smokers. Loss of GSTP1 function by DNA hypermethylation together with changes in the methylation levels of repetitive elements like LINE-1 and Sat2 was reported in prostatic preneoplastic lesions. Also, DNA hypermethylation for hMLH1 and MGMT DNA repair genes was reported in precursor lesions to colorectal cancer. These epigenetic alterations may be influenced by factors such as xenoestrogens, folate, and multivitamins. Detection of these changes may help determining cancer susceptibility and early diagnosis.",

The identification of a cdk4 inhibitor, p16INK4, as a target for mutations in cultured tumor lines and primary tumors suggested that RB activity may be affected in these cells. We have examined 88 lung cancer lines for p16INK4 protein expression and have observed a striking inverse correlation between the presence of p16INK4 and wildtype RB. We demonstrated that only 6/55 (11%) of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) samples had absent p16INK4 protein, and all 6 belonged to the rare subset of SCLC with wildtype RB expression. Conversely of 48 SCLC samples with absent or mutant RB, all showed detectable levels of p16INK4 protein. In contrast, we observed that 23/33 (70%) of non-SCLC samples had loss of p16INK4. Twenty-two of 26 non-SCLC lines with wildtype RB had absent p16INK4 while 6 of 7 non-SCLC lines with absent or mutant RB had detectable p16INK4. The inverse correlation of RB and p16INK4 expression and the absence of p16INK4 inactivation in RB (-/-) SCLC lines (0/48) confirms a common p16INK4/RB growth suppressor pathway in human cancers and provides evidence that p16INK4, and not an adjacent gene on chromosome 9p, is a specific target for mutational events.",

In this study, we examined the promoter methylation of six genes (SFN, P16, hMLH1, HOXD13, PCDHGB7 and RASSF1a) in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from serum. We used a high-throughput DNA methylation assay (MethyLight) to examine serum from 749 cases including breast cancer patients, patients with benign breast diseases and healthy women. The six-gene methylation panel test achieved 79.6% and 82.4% sensitivity with a specificity of 72.4% and 78.1% in diagnosis of breast cancer when compared with healthy and benign disease controls, respectively. Moreover, the methylation panel positive group showed significant differences in the following independent variables: (a) involvement of family history of tumors; (b) a low proliferative index, ki-67; (c) high ratios in luminal subtypes. Additionally the panel also complemented some breast cancer cases which were neglected by mammography or ultrasound.

However, its expression in vulvar carcinomas, which have a diverse pathogenesis, has not been extensively studied. One hundred seventy-seven vulvar intraepithelial neoplasms (VIN), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and benign squamous epithelia were analyzed for p16 expression. RNA/RNA in situ hybridization was used to detect HPV 16 E6/E7 transcripts in 112. Ninety-five percent of VIN 3 and basaloid or warty SCCs (76/80) and 4% of keratinizing SCC (2/48) were moderately to strongly immunopositive for p16, which localized to nucleus and cytoplasm; 52/58 analyzed (90%) contained HPV 16 transcripts. The positive predictive value (PPV) of moderate to strong diffuse p16 immunostaining and HPV positivity for the diagnosis of VIN 3 and of basaloid or warty SCC was 97% and 95%, respectively. Conversely, 94% of keratinizing SCC contained heterogeneous staining, and when present, it was strictly cytoplasmic and frequently localized to the cells at the epithelial-stromal interface. Benign squamous epithelia were p16 negative, with the exception of lichen sclerosus, which contained focal and heterogeneously p16 positive in 42%. As in the cervix, intense diffuse p16 expression supports an HPV-related neoplastic process in vulvar neoplasia, irrespective of the level of differentiation. Up-regulation of p16 at the epithelial-stromal interface in HPV negative keratinizing SCCs is consistent with an HPV-independent response to alterations associated with invasion.

In this study, we examined the correlation between PGE2 receptor 2 (EP2) expression and p16INK4A methylation in NSCLC, and the association with clinicopathological features and prognostic significance. We retrospectively reviewed 88 NSCLC patients who underwent resection from July 1993 to May 1997. The tumors included 43 adenocarcinomas, 39 squamous cell carcinomas, and 6 large cell carcinomas. EP2 expression was determined by immunostaining, and p16INK4A methylation was analyzed by methylation specific PCR. EP2 was overexpressed in 44% of NSCLC patients, 61% of adenocarcinoma cases, 28% of squamous cell carcinoma cases, and 33% of large cell carcinoma cases. EP2 expression positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.034), especially in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.009). Methylation of p16INK4A was detected in 34% of NSCLC patients, 23% of adenocarcinoma cases, 44% of squamous cell carcinoma cases, and 50% of large cell carcinoma cases. In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, EP2 overexpression correlated with poor prognosis with a relative risk of 2.4 (confidence interval 2.1-51.8, P<0.003), and positively correlated with p16INK4A methylation (P<0.024). Adenocarcinoma patients with p16INK4A methylation had poor prognosis with a relative risk of 2.4 (confidence interval 1.8-69.7, P<0.009), but this was not correlated with EP2 expression. In conclusion, EP2 overexpression was common in NSCLCs, especially in adenocarcinomas. Synchronous alteration of p16INK4A and EP2 may accelerate progression of squamous cell carcinomas. These two alterations may differentially affect pathogenesis among subtypes of NSCLC.",

Results form recent studies on the effect hERG1 inhibition in some breast cancer cells are controversial as it can lead to apoptosis or protect against cell death. Nevertheless, these data suggest that the hERG1 channel could have an important role in cancer biology. Here we report the effects of hyperstimulation of hERG1 channel in human mammary gland adenocarcinoma-derived cells. Application of the hERG1 activator, the diphenylurea derivative NS1643, inhibits cell proliferation irreversibly. This event is accompanied by a preferential arrest of the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase without the occurrence of apoptotic events. Consequently, cells responded to NS1643 by developing a senescence-like phenotype associated with increased protein levels of the tumor suppressors p21 and p16(INK4a) and by a positive β-galactosidase assay. These data suggest that prolonged stimulation of the hERG1 potassium channel may activate a senescence program and offers a compelling opportunity to develop a potential antiproliferative cancer therapy.",

In this study, we observed that methylation analysis of exon 1 alpha gave false positive results in three samples of normal rat mammary epithelia and in two of six primary mammary carcinomas. Therefore, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5' region of the rat p16 gene. To confirm that methylation status of the 5' region is correlated with p16 expression, the methylation status was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR in three samples of normal mammary glands, six samples of mammary carcinomas and four cell lines. The 5' region was demethylated in all of the three normal and six carcinoma samples that fully expressed p16. On the other hand, the 5' region was highly methylated in the 3Y1 cell line, which lacked p16 expression, but without deletion.

Quantitative methylation specific (qMS)-PCR was conducted on three specimen sets: 44 malignant (CA) and 34 normal (NL) tissue specimens, 18 matched CA, adjacent normal (ANL) tissue and NAF specimens, and 119 MD specimens. Training and validation tissue sets were analyzed to determine the optimal group of cancer predictive genes for NAF and MD analysis. NAF and MD cytologic review were also performed. Methylation of CCND-2, p16, RAR-beta and RASSF-1a was significantly more prevalent in tumor than in normal tissue specimens. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.96. For the 18 matched CA, ANL and NAF specimens, the four predictive genes identified in cancer tissue contained increased methylation in CA vs. ANL tissue; NAF samples had higher methylation than ANL specimens. Methylation frequency was higher in MD specimens from breasts with cancer than benign samples for p16 and RASSF-1a. In summary, i) routine quantitative DNA methylation assessment in NAF and MD samples is possible, and ii) genes hypermethylated in malignant breast tissue are also altered in matched NAF and in MD samples, and may be useful to assist in early breast cancer detection.",

Implicit was also the attempt to understand the role of E2F, as indicated by p16(INK4a), in evolution of SCC from HSIL. No ethnic predilection was noted for LSIL, HSIL or SCC. Patients with SCC were significantly older by about 14-years compared with HSIL (p < 0.05) while there was no significant age difference between HSIL and LSIL. p16(INK4a) expression was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in both HSIL (88.9%) and SCC (83.3%) compared with LSIL (3.4%) and NSqE (0%); the NSqE being normal squamous epithelium noted in 17 of the LSIL, 19 HSIL and 5 SCC. From these findings there is suggestion that fundamental upstream events viz HPV integration, E7 upregulation followed by E2F activation occurs at point of transformation to HSIL and continues unrelentingly for another one to two decades before hitherto unclear factors convert a non-invasive lesion into an overtly invasive malignant counterpart. Interestingly, the occurrence of HSIL and LSIL in almost the same age group could mean that alteration from episomal to integrated form of HPV may not incur a prolonged incubation period, unlike from HSIL to SCC.",

We observed that the expression of p16INK4A and Ki-67 were positively associated with CIN grade, p161NK4A expressions increased significantly with high-risk HPV infection. We observed a positive correlation between the expression of the p16INK4A and Ki-67.;In our study, the expression of p16 and Ki-67 were positively related to the CIN grade. p16INK4A expressions of high-risk HPV specimens significantly increased more than Ki-67.

Intracellular delivery of multiple functional peptides forms the basis for a potent, non-invasive mode of delivery, providing distinctive therapeutic advantages. We examine the growth suppression efficiency of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by single-peptide targeting. We simultaneously introduced p16INK4a tumor suppressor peptides by Wr-T-mediated peptide delivery. Wr-T-mediated transport of p16INK4a functional peptide into 10 RCC lines, lacking expression of the p16INK4a molecule, reversed the specific loss of p16 function, thereby drastically inhibiting tumor growth in all but 3 lines by >95% within the first 96 h. In vivo analysis using SK-RC-7 RCC xenografts in nude mice demonstrated tumor growth inhibition by the p16INK4a peptide alone, however, inoculation of Wr-T and the p16INK4a functional peptide mixture, via the heart resulted in complete tumor regression. Thus, restoration of tumor suppressor function with Wr-T peptide delivery represents a powerful approach, with mechanistic implications for the development of efficacious molecular targeting therapeutics against intractable RCC.",

The tumor suppressor p16, encoded by the CDKN2/INK4a locus, has been reported mutated in >or=24% of squamous cell carcinomas. Mutations of the p16 gene have also been found in actinic keratoses, the first identifiable lesion in the continuum from normal skin to squamous cell carcinoma. We hypothesized that there may be an appreciable difference in expression of p16 between normal skin, actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Ten actinic keratoses, 10 in situ squamous cell carcinomas, and 10 invasive squamous cell carcinomas were examined using the immunoperoxidase method with antigen retrieval for anti-p16(INK4a) antibody. All 10 actinic keratoses were positive for weak to moderate p16 staining in the lower third to lower half of the epidermis (especially the basal keratinocytes). This staining was significant when compared with the lack of staining seen in normal skin controls. Twenty percent of in situ squamous cell carcinomas had moderate to strong staining in only the lower half to lower two thirds of the epidermis, whereas 70% of the in situ squamous cell carcinomas exhibited full-thickness p16 staining, with no staining in the dermis. Thirty percent of invasive squamous cell carcinomas had full-thickness staining of the in situ component of the lesion, and 100% of invasive squamous cell carcinomas exhibited moderate to strong staining of the invasive component of the lesion. These findings indicate correlation between the increased expression of p16 during the progression of skin from actinic keratosis to in situ squamous cell carcinoma to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. These data may lend further support to the view of the actinic keratosis as a precursor lesion to squamous cell carcinoma.",

We analysed microdissected tumour samples from 105 consecutive patients with primary non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma. Quantitative methylation analysis of CpG sites in the promoter region of the genes was performed with methylation sensitive quantitative real time PCR ('Methylight'). Univariate analysis for association with tumour recurrence was carried out with the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. Follow-up data were available in 95/105 patients (91.4%). A tumour recurrence was observed in 26 patients (27.3%). We could identify six genes (SOCS-1, STAT-1, BCL-2, DAPK, TIMP-3, E-Cadherin), where methylation was associated with tumour recurrence. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, TIMP-3 showed a significant association with recurrence free survival. Methylation of TIMP-3 predicted prolonged disease free interval. In this study, we report a comprehensive analysis on prognostic relevance of gene methylation in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We identified one gene (TIMP-3) where methylation was associated with a more favourable outcome. Our data strongly support the usefulness of gene methylation as a prognostic marker in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.",

In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of p16 in apoptosis induced by ultraviolet light (the most important etiological cause of skin cancer) and cisplatin (an anticancer DNA damaging agent). It is clearly shown that p16-compromised osteosarcoma U2OS cell line and p16-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts are sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis, as compared to their respective isogenic p16-expressing cells (EH1, EH2) and p16 +/+, indicating that p16 protects cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to UV light. Importantly, this reduction in UV-mediated apoptosis was associated with downregulation of the proapoptotic Bax protein, with no effect on Bcl-2 expression, suggesting that this antiapoptotic role of p16 is mediated via the intrinsic-mitochondrial pathway. On the other hand, p16 sensitized cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis through Bcl-2 decline. Interestingly, only proliferating but not G1-arrested EH1 cells underwent apoptosis in response to the anticancer drug. These novel findings provide further insight into the role of p16 in carcinogenesis, and has potential implications for future therapy strategies.",

That the rates of hrHPV when compared with p16 expression were almost equivalent in HSIL and SCC while p16 was expressed in only 1 of the 10 LSIL with hrHPV, are expected considering the likelihood that transformation has occurred in HSIL and SCC but does not occur in majority of LSIL.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent data challenge the relevance of the RB pathway to cancer based on RB inactivation, at least in breast tumors. To obtain information on the actual role of the components of the RB pathway in tumor progression we decided to investigate whether their quantitative changes were associated with variations in the level of RB phosphorylation in human breast cancer. A series of 68 human primary breast carcinomas was studied. Five cases were excluded from the study due to their lack of RB expression. In the remaining 63 cases the expression of cyclin D1, cdk4, cyclin E, and INK4a mRNA was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. The level of RB phosphorylated protein (ppRB) and p27 expression was immunohistochemically analyzed by measuring the percentage of stained cells (labeling index, LI). Cell proliferation rate was measured by Ki67 LI evaluation. The ppRB LI ranged from 5.2 to 73.8 and, as expected, was strongly related to the Ki67 LI (r=0.80; p<0.001). The expression of cyclin D1 mRNA, expressed in arbitrary units (a. u.), ranged from 1.15 to 123.0 and was inversely related to the ppRB LI (p=0.021) and Ki67 LI (p<0.001). Neither the cdk4 (range from 0.07 to 1.13 a. u.) nor the cyclin E (range from 0.13 to 9.27 a. u.) mRNA expression was significantly associated with the ppRB LI (p=0.962 and p=0.103, respectively). Cyclin E was related to Ki67 LI (p=0.022). Both INK4a mRNA (range from 0.01 to 0.60 a. u.) and p27 (LI from 0.0 to 73.1) values were inversely related to the ppRB LI (p=0.022 and p=0.014, respectively). Cyclin D1, cdk4, and cyclin E mRNA expressions were not significantly related to one another. In human primary breast cancers, the expression levels of the factors known to facilitate the cell cycle progression by RB protein phosphorylation were not positively related to ppRB-LI. Pathological increases of cyclin D, cdk4, and cyclin E are very likely associated with other biological functions other than their well-established action on cell cycle progression.",

The mechanisms that regulate alternative reading frame (ARF) turnover have been obscure for long time, being ARF a relatively stable protein. Recently, it has been described that its degradation depends, at least in part, on the proteasome and that it can be subjected to N-terminal ubiquitination. We have previously reported that ARF protein levels are regulated by TBP-1 (Tat-Binding Protein 1), a multifunctional protein, component of the regulatory subunit of the proteasome, involved in different cellular processes. Here we demonstrate that the stabilization effect exerted by TBP-1 requires an intact N-terminal 39 amino acids in ARF and occurs independently from N-terminal ubiquitination of the protein. Furthermore, we observed that ARF can be degraded in vitro by the 20S proteasome, in the absence of ubiquitination and this effect can be counteracted by TBP-1. These observations seem relevant in the comprehension of the regulation of ARF metabolism as, among the plethora of cellular ARF's interactors already identified, only NPM/B23 and TBP-1 appear to be involved in the control of ARF intracellular levels.",

To identify predictors of response, we determined the in vitro sensitivity to PD 0332991 across a panel of molecularly characterized human breast cancer cell lines.;Forty-seven human breast cancer and immortalized cell lines representing the known molecular subgroups of breast cancer were treated with PD 0332991 to determine IC50 values. These data were analyzed against baseline gene expression data to identify genes associated with PD 0332991 response.;Cell lines representing luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtype (including those that are HER2 amplified) were most sensitive to growth inhibition by PD 0332991 while nonluminal/basal subtypes were most resistant. Analysis of variance identified 450 differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells. pRb and cyclin D1 were elevated and CDKN2A (p16) was decreased in the most sensitive lines. Cell cycle analysis showed G0/G1 arrest in sensitive cell lines and Western blot analysis demonstrated that Rb phosphorylation is blocked in sensitive lines but not resistant lines. PD 0332991 was synergistic with tamoxifen and trastuzumab in ER+ and HER2-amplified cell lines, respectively.

It is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor presently in clinical trials. In this study, we examined the effect of flavopiridol on a panel of glioma cell lines having different genetic profiles: five of six have codeletion of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF); three of six have p53 mutations; and one of six shows overexpression of mouse double minute-2 (MDM2) protein. Independent of retinoblastoma and p53 tumor suppressor pathway alterations, flavopiridol induced apoptosis in all cell lines but through a caspase-independent mechanism. No cleavage products for caspase 3 or its substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or caspase 8 were detected. The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit flavopiridol-induced apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage measured by cytochrome c release and transmission electron microscopy was not observed in drug-treated glioma cells. In contrast, flavopiridol treatment induced translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondria to the nucleus. The proteins cyclin D(1) and MDM2 involved in the regulation of retinoblastoma and p53 activity, respectively, were down-regulated early after flavopiridol treatment. Given that MDM2 protein can confer oncogenic properties under certain circumstances, loss of MDM2 expression in tumor cells could promote increased chemosensitivity. After drug treatment, a low Bcl-2/Bax ratio was observed, a condition that may favor apoptosis. Taken together, the data indicate that flavopiridol has activity against glioma cell lines in vitro and should be considered for clinical development in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.",

Both tumour sample sets had previously been analysed for RASSF1A promoter methylation, and p16INK4a methylation results were also available for the Wilms' tumour samples. Wilms' tumours demonstrated a high incidence of methylation at CASP8 (43%) and MGMT (30%), intermediate frequencies at NORE1A (15%), p14ARF (15%), p16INK4a (10%), DAPK (11%) and CRBP1 (9%), but promoter methylation was rare or absent at RARB2 (0%), CDH13 (0%) and CDH1 (3%). No association was detected between methylation of RASSF1A, CASP8 or MGMT in individual tumours. The frequency of MGMT methylation was higher in stage 1 and 2 tumours (50%) than in stage 3 and 4 tumours (17%) but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.06). RCC were most frequently methylated at DAPK (24%), MT1G (20%), NORE1A (19%), CDH1 (16%) and MGMT (9%) and not or rarely at SDHB (4%), RARB2 (0%), p16INK4a (0%) and CDH13 (3%). There were no associations between methylation of RASSF1A, DAPK and CDH1 in individual tumours. Papillary RCC demonstrated a higher frequency of DAPK methylation (43%) than clear cell tumours (19%) (P=0.14). We have demonstrated that de novo promoter methylation is frequent in Wilms' tumour and RCC, and these data enable methylation profiles to be constructed for each tumour type. Thus, combining our results with data published previously, it appears that promoter methylation occurs frequently (> or =20% of primary tumours) at CASP8, SLIT2 and RASSF1A in Wilms' tumour and at RASSF1A, TIMP3, DAPK, SLIT2, MT1G and GSTP1 in RCC.",

We have examined how disease progression correlates with changes in expression of the p14ARF (ARF) tumour suppressor, a key regulator of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway that is silenced in some 30% of cancers overall, but for which a role in oesophageal cancer is unclear. We have used quantitative PCR, RT-PCR, methylation-specific PCR and chromatin-immunoprecipitation to examine the regulation and function of ARF in oesophageal adenocarcinoma tissue specimens and cell lines. We find highly significant reductions (P< 0.001) in ARF expression during disease progression from normal oesophageal epithelium to Barrett's Oesophagus to adenocarcinoma, with 57/76 (75%) adenocarcinomas displaying undetectable levels of ARF expression. Retention of ARF expression in adenocarcinoma is a highly significant indicator of increased survival (P< 0.001) and outperforms all clinical variables in a multivariate model. CpG methylation as well as histone H3 methylation of lysines 9 and 27 contribute independently to ARF gene silencing in adenocarcinoma cell lines and can be reversed by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The results suggest that silencing of ARF is involved in the pathogenesis of oesophageal adenocarcinoma and show that either DNA or histone methylation can provide the primary mechanism for ARF gene silencing.

There are many known and suspected carcinogens present in cigarette smoke, including alpha-emitting radioisotopes. Epidemiologic studies have shown that increased lung cancer risk is associated with exposure to ionizing radiation, and it is estimated that the majority of smoking-induced lung cancers may be at least partly attributable to the inhaled and deposited radiation dose from radioisotopes in the cigarette smoke itself. Recent research shows that silencing of the tumor suppressor gene p16(INK4a) (p16) by promoter methylation plays a role in smoking-related lung cancer. Inactivation of p16 has also been associated with lung cancer incidence in radiation-exposed workers, suggesting that radionuclides in cigarette smoke may be acting with other compounds to cause smoking-induced lung cancer. We evaluated the mechanism of ionizing radiation as an accepted cause of lung cancer in terms of its dose from tobacco smoke and silencing of p16. Because both radiation and cigarette smoking are associated with inactivation of p16, and p16 inactivation has been shown to play a major role in carcinogenesis, ionizing radiation from cigarette smoke likely plays a role in lung cancer risk. How large a role it plays, relative to chemical carcinogens and other modes of action, remains to be elucidated.",

We have generated transgenic mice moderately overexpressing Sirt1 under its own regulatory elements (Sirt1-tg). Old Sirt1-tg mice present lower levels of DNA damage, decreased expression of the ageing-associated gene p16(Ink4a), a better general health and fewer spontaneous carcinomas and sarcomas. These effects, however, were not sufficiently potent to affect longevity. To further extend these observations, we developed a metabolic syndrome-associated liver cancer model in which wild-type mice develop multiple carcinomas. Sirt1-tg mice show a reduced susceptibility to liver cancer and exhibit improved hepatic protection from both DNA damage and metabolic damage. Together, these results provide direct proof of the anti-ageing activity of Sirt1 in mammals and of its tumour suppression activity in ageing- and metabolic syndrome-associated cancer.",

However, not all tumors respond favorably to these drugs. CDK4 activity is critical for progression through G1 phase and into the mitotic cell cycle. Inhibiting this kinase induces Rb-positive cells to exit the cell cycle into either a quiescent or senescent state. In this report, using well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS) cell lines, we show that the proteolytic turnover of MDM2 is required for CDK4i-induced senescence. Failure to reduce MDM2 does not prevent CDK4i-induced withdrawal from the cell cycle but the cells remain in a reversible quiescent state. Reducing MDM2 in these cells drives them into the more stable senescent state. CDK4i-induced senescence associated with loss of MDM2 is also observed in some breast cancer, lung cancer and glioma cell lines indicating that this is not limited to WD/DDLS cells in which MDM2 is overexpressed or in cells that contain wild type p53. MDM2 turnover depends on its E3 ligase activity and expression of ATRX. Interestingly, in seven patients the changes in MDM2 expression were correlated with outcome. These insights identify MDM2 and ATRX as new regulators controlling geroconversion, the process by which quiescent cells become senescent, and this insight may be exploited to improve the activity of CDK4i in cancer therapy.",

Shikonin-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, up-regulation of p73, and down-regulation of BCL-2. Shikonin also induced up-regulation of the tumor suppressor gene, p16(INK4A). Increasing transcriptional activity of p16(INK4A) by shikonin treatment, we observed in luciferase promoter assay, reflects reduced promoter binding by down-regulation of ICBP90 (inverted CCAAT box binding protein, 90 kDa), which are involved in down-regulation of its partner, DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1).

Genetic alterations involving the 9p21 region are common in human cancers. A consecutive series of 64 untreated patients (median of follow up 53 months) undergoing surgical resection for locally advanced laryngeal squamous-cell carcinomas (LSCCs) has been studied prospectively. Our purpose was to investigate p16 alterations (9p21 allelic loss, hypermethylation and point mutations) and their possible association with clinico-pathological data and flow cytometric variables (DNA-ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF)), and to determine the possible prognostic role of this gene in these tumors. PCR-based techniques were used for investigating 9p21 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and methylation promoter status of the p16 gene. p16 mutations were detected by PCR-SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) and sequencing. 9p21 LOH was detected in 16/62 (26%) informative tumors, point mutations in 5% (3/64) and hypermethylation in 9% (6/64) of the cases. p16 alterations were significantly associated with high SPF and DNA-aneuploidy. By univariate analysis, poor histologic differentiation, stage IV, DNA-aneuploidy and p16 point mutations proved to be significantly related to quicker relapse, whereas these same factors, and in addition high SPF, 9p21 LOH and any p16 alterations were significantly related to shorter overall survival. By Cox proportional hazards analysis only histologic grade (G3) and p16 point mutations were independently related to both disease relapse and death. Our study has identified p16 point mutations as important biomolecular indicators in LSCCs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Multiple primary tumors in pancreatic cancer patients might indicate a genetic predisposition to the development of malignancies. In this study we evaluated whether the mutation rate of the TP53 and p16INK4a genes of pancreatic cancers differs in pancreatic cancer patients with and without multiple primaries. Furthermore, we investigated whether pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries carry germline mutations in either p16INK4a, TP53, or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes to detect a genetic alteration that predisposes to the development of different primaries. Fourteen (23%) of 60 pancreatic cancer patients developed histologically verified additional primaries during their lifetimes. Normal constitutional and tumor DNA of the 14 patients with a positive cancer history, but negative family history, were analyzed for p16INK4a, TP53, and BRCA2 mutations by single-strand conformational variant (SSCV) analysis and direct sequencing. Hypermethylation of the p16INK4a promoter region in pancreatic cancers was identified by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR; MSP). Four of 14 pancreatic carcinomas carried somatic intragenic p16INK4a mutations, and another four tumors revealed hypermethylation of the p16INK4a promoter region. Somatic intragenic TP53 mutations were identified in six of 14 tumors. None of the pancreatic cancer patients carried TP53 or BRCA2 germline mutations. In contrast, one of 14 pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries carried the p16INK4a mutation A68V in his germline. This mutation was localized in the conserved second ankyrin repeat of p16INK4a and did not occur in 100 control patients. The frequency of somatic TP53 and p16INK4a mutations in pancreatic cancer is similar in patients with and without multiple primaries. TP53 and BRCA2 germline mutations seem not to be significantly associated with the occurrence of multiple primaries in pancreatic cancer patients. However, p16INK4a germline mutations might be causative for tumor development in some pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries. The genetic investigation of patients with accumulation of different cancers even without a positive family history may be a new approach for the understanding of the relation of different cancers.",

Both genes are candidates for the putative tumour suppressor genes located at chromosome 9p21 and are frequently inactivated in many human cancers through homozygous deletion. More recently, another reported pathway of inactivation involves loss of transcription associated with de novo methylation of the 5' CpG island of p16/MTS1 and p15/MTS2 in human cancers. We examined a total of 34 tumours from 30 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for deletion, mutation and DNA methylation of these two genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, sequence analysis and Southern blot. Homozygous deletions of P16/MTS1 exon 1 were only identified in 1 of 30 cases (3%). Homozygous deletions of p15 exon 1 or exon 2 were found in 7 of 30 cases (13%). Automated sequencing analysis of p16 exon 1 and 2 and p15 exon 1 and 2 failed to demonstrate mutations in either p16 or p15 in any of these specimens. No aberrant 5' CpG island hypermethylation of p16 or p15 was found in any of the primary tumours by Southern blot. These data suggest that the p16/MTS1 gene has a limited role in HCC.

Here, we report that expression of deubiquitylase ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is higher in human HCC tissues than in matched peritumoral tissues. Ectopic USP7 expression promotes growth of HCC cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, USP7 overexpression fosters HCC cell growth by forming a complex with and stabilizing thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 12 (TRIP12), which induces constitutive p14(ARF) ubiquitination. Clinically, USP7 overexpression is significantly correlated with a malignant phenotype, including larger tumor size, multiple tumor, poor differentiation, elevated alpha-fetoprotein, and microvascular invasion. Moreover, overexpression of USP7 and/or TRIP12 correlates with shorter OS and higher cumulative recurrence rates of HCC.;USP7 stabilizes TRIP12 by deubiquitination, thus constitutively inactivating p14(ARF) and promoting HCC progression.

Comparison of the number of p16(INK4a) immunoreactive cells/1,000 cells exhibited a significantly higher mean count in HSIL (8.80 +/- 1.13) than other cytological groups. The mean count of LSIL (1.09 +/- 0.18) was significantly higher than that of the negative group (0.82 +/- 0.40).

Thus, we sought to determine the relationship between cyclin D1 and/or p16INK4A expression and disease outcome in squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue. Immunohistochemical detection of nuclear proteins cyclin D1, p53, and p16INK4A, and the Ki-67 labeling index was undertaken in tissue sections from 148 tongue cancers treated by surgical resection. Nuclear antigen status was analyzed in relation to pathological variables, tumor recurrence, and patient survival. Statistical significance was assessed using chi2 analysis for pathological variables and the Kaplan-Meier method, log rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards model for survival parameters. Overexpression of cyclin D1 occurred in 68% of tumors (100 of 147) and was associated with increased lymph node stage (P = 0.014), increased tumor grade (P = 0.003), and reduced disease-free (P = 0.006) and overall (P = 0.01) survival. Loss of p16INK4A expression was demonstrated in 55% of tumors (78 of 143) and was associated with reduced disease-free (P = 0.007) and overall (P = 0.014) survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that in addition to pathological stage and regional lymph node status, cyclin D1 overexpression and loss of p16INK4A expression are independent predictors of death from tongue cancer. Loss of p16INK4A in the presence of cyclin D1 overexpression conferred a significantly worse disease-free (P = 0.011) and overall (P = 0.002) survival at 5 years. p53 nuclear accumulation and the Ki-67 labeling index were not prognostic. These data indicate that cyclin D1 overexpression and loss of p16INK4A expression predict early relapse and reduced survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue. Simultaneous assessment of cyclin D1 and p16INK4A protein levels define subgroups of patients at increased risk of relapse and may be of clinical utility in optimizing therapy.",

Notwithstanding, several clinical and histologic studies as well as molecular data show that endometriosis could be a precursor of sporadic endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas at extrauterine loci. Several reports have implicated alterations of the hMLH1 and p16(ink4a) (p16) genes, in particular hypermethylation of the promoter region, and of the PTEN gene, principally genetic mutations, in endometrial and ovarian cancers and have indicated that these alterations are already present in precancer conditions. In this report, we analyzed the methylation status of hMLH1 and p16 and the protein expression of PTEN and hMLH1 in 46 cases of endometriosis stages III and IV to better define the possible involvement of these genes in the malignant transformation of endometriosis. We found abnormal methylation of hMLH1 in 4 of the 46 cases (8.6%). In addition, these cases had no detectable hMLH1 protein expression. Regarding patients with hMLH1 alterations, 2 were classified as stage IV and 2 showed coexistent endometriosis and carcinoma. Only 1 case of endometriosis (2.17%), classified as atypical, showed abnormal methylation of p16. Reduced PTEN protein expression was detected in 7 of 46 cases (15.21%): 5 were clinically classified as stage IV, and the other 2 presented both cancer and hypermethylated hMLH1. Our preliminary study suggests that reduced expression of both hMLH1 and PTEN may be involved in the malignant evolution of endometriosis and should be used as markers of neoplastic transformation in aggressive endometriosis with elevated tumor markers.",

T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) and B-cell ALLs show a remarkable rate of 75 and 20% homozygous deletion of this gene, respectively. Restoration of p16 expression in p16-deficient solid tumor cell lines results in a dramatic reduction of growth and maligant phenotype. To test the hypothesis that p16INK4A suppresses the growth of p16-deficient leukemias, we utilized a retroviral system to restore wild-type (wt) or mutant p16 protein expression. We tested the efficacy of our system by expressing the wt or mutant p16 genes in the osteosarcoma cell line, U20S, which lacks p16 and retains functional retinoblastoma protein (pRb). The wt p16 protein formed complexes with both cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 and inhibited U20S growth by 30-fold. The p16 mutants E120K and R144C formed complexes with CDK4 and CDK6 in cells and inhibited cell growth as effectively as wt p16 (20-fold) while the mutant proteins that did not complex with detectable levels of CDK4 or CDK6 only inhibited growth 0.25- and five-fold (G101W and D141, respectively) or not at all (H83Y and DA4). The COOH-terminal 'tail' of the wt p16 protein (amino acid residues 141-156), missing in mutant D141, enhanced the growth suppressive capability of p16. The amino acid substitutions in mutants G101W and H83Y not only disrupted CDK4 and CDK6 binding, but decreased the protein half-lives by two- and three-fold, respectively, compared to wt p16. The wt, but not mutant p16 genes, effectively inhibited the growth of T cell acute lymphoblastic (CEM) and myeloid leukemia (NB-4 and K562) cell lines that lacked the p16 gene, but retained functional pRb. Growth of the T-ALL cell line, HSB-2, which lacked both p16 and pRb, was not inhibited, indicating the growth suppression involved the pRb pathway. These results define regions critical for the function of p16 and demonstrate that restoration of wt p16 expression in p16-deficient leukemias significantly reverted their transformed phenotype and inhibited their growth.",

HPV-induced oral dysplasia or carcinoma may be a unique tumor entity in terms of biologic behavior and treatment decisions. In detecting such cases, most reported studies have used techniques that are less sensitive than DNA amplification. Recent reports have suggested that overexpression of the p16INK4 protein is a surrogate marker of HPV-induced high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma. However, the correlation between expression of p16INK4 and the presence of HPV DNA as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification has not been previously reported. The purpose of this research was to determine if immunohistochemistry for p16 would serve as a marker of HPV-associated high-grade oral squamous dysplasia.;Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 41 cases of high-grade oral squamous dysplasia were randomly selected. Expression of p16INK4 protein was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis (16P04 Neomarkers, Fremont, CA). Strong and diffuse nuclear staining restricted to the dysplastic region in the epithelium was scored as positive for protein expression, whereas focal or weak nuclear or cytoplasmic staining was scored as negative. The presence of HPV was determined by microdissection, DNA extraction, and PCR DNA amplification using elongated primers that align with corresponding sequences of the L1 region of 23 mucosotropic HPV genotypes. The HPV type was determined by direct sequencing of the PCR product. Normal squamous epithelium was used as an internal negative control, and cases of severe cervical high-grade squamous dysplasia were used as a positive control for immunohistochemical staining and PCR.;The results of immunohistochemical analysis for overexpression of p16INK4 were positive in 6 of the 41 tissue sections. The results of PCR DNA amplification were also positive for these 6 sections. HPV-16 was identified in 5 of the positive cases; in the other case, the viral strain could not be determined.;Immunohistochemical detection of p16INK4 is a technically simple and potentially reliable assay for diagnosing cases of HPV-induced oral high-grade squamous dysplasia. Detecting such lesions may influence future therapeutic decisions.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Periostin is usually considered as an oncogene in diverse human cancers, including breast, prostate, colon, esophagus, and pancreas cancers, whereas it acts as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer. In gastric cancer, it has been demonstrated that periglandular periostin expression is decreased whereas stromal periostin expression is significantly increased as compared with normal gastric tissues. Moreover, periostin produced by stromal myofibroblasts markedly promotes gastric cancer cell growth. These observations suggest that periostin derived from different types of cells may play distinct biological roles in gastric tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the biological functions and related molecular mechanisms of epithelial cell-derived periostin in gastric cancer. Our data showed that periglandular periostin was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues as compared with matched normal gastric mucosa. In addition, its expression in metastatic lymph nodes was significantly lower than that in their primary cancer tissues. Our data also demonstrated that periglandular periostin expression was negatively associated with tumor stage. More importantly, restoration of periostin expression in gastric cancer cells dramatically suppressed cell growth and invasiveness. Elucidation of the mechanisms involved revealed that periostin restoration enhanced Rb phosphorylation and sequentially activated the transcription of E2F1 target gene p14(ARF), leading to Mdm2 inactivation and the stabilization of p53 and E-cadherin proteins. Strikingly, these effects of periostin were abolished upon Rb deletion. Collectively, we have for the first time demonstrated that epithelial cell-derived periostin exerts tumor-suppressor activities in gastric cancer through stabilizing p53 and E-cadherin proteins via the Rb/E2F1/p14(ARF)/Mdm2 signaling pathway.

With increasing age, breast cancer incidence increases, with hormone receptor-positive and other luminal-like subtype tumors comprising a majority of cases. It is not known at what stage of tumor progression subtype specification occurs, nor how the process of aging affects the intrinsic subtype. We examined subtype markers in immortalized human mammary epithelial cell lines established following exposure of primary cultured cell strains to a two-step immortalization protocol that targets the two main barriers to immortality: stasis (stress-associated senescence) and replicative senescence. Cell lines derived from epithelial cells obtained from non-tumorous pre- and post-menopausal breast surgery tissues were compared. Additionally, comparisons were made between lines generated using two different genetic interventions to bypass stasis: transduction of either an shRNA that down-regulated p16(INK4A), or overexpressed constitutive active cyclin D1/CDK2. In all cases, the replicative senescence barrier was bypassed by transduction of c-Myc. Cells from all resulting immortal lines exhibited normal karyotypes. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and gene expression analyses of lineage-specific markers were used to categorize the intrinsic subtypes of the immortalized lines. Bypassing stasis with p16 shRNA in young strains generated cell lines that were invariably basal-like, but the lines examined from older strains exhibited some luminal features such as keratin 19 and estrogen receptor expression. Overexpression of cyclin D1/CDK2 resulted in keratin 19 positive, luminal-like cell lines from both young and old strains, and the lines examined from older strains exhibited estrogen receptor expression. Thus age and the method of bypassing stasis independently influence the subtype of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells. ",

HPV-positive HNSCC preferentially affect the oropharynx and tonsils. Localized HPV-positive HNSCCs have a favorable prognosis and treatment outcome. However, the impact of HPV in advanced or metastatic HNSCC remains to be defined. In particular, it is unclear whether HPV modulates the response to cetuximab, an antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a mainstay of treatment of advanced HNSCC. To this end, we have examined the sensitivity of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC models to cetuximab and cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have stably expressed the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 in cetuximab-sensitive cancer cell lines to specifically investigate their role in the antibody response. The endogenous HPV status or the expression of HPV oncogenes had no significant impact on cetuximab-mediated suppression of EGFR signaling and proliferation in vitro. Cetuximab effectively inhibited the growth of E6- and E7-expressing tumors grafted in NOD/SCID mice. In support, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from cetuximab-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC were probed for p16(INK4a) expression, an established biomarker of HPV infection. Response rates (45.5% versus 45.5%) and median progression-free survival (97 versus 92 days) following cetuximab-based therapy were similar in patients with p16(INK4A)-positive and p16(INK4A)-negative tumors. In conclusion, HPV oncogenes do not modulate the anti-EGFR antibody response in HSNCC. Cetuximab treatment should be administered independently of HPV status. ",

In addition to its longevity, naked mole-rats have an extraordinary resistance to cancer as tumors have never been observed in these rodents. Furthermore, we show that a combination of activated Ras and SV40 LT fails to induce robust anchorage-independent growth in naked mole-rat cells, while it readily transforms mouse fibroblasts. The mechanisms responsible for the cancer resistance of naked mole-rats were unknown. Here we show that naked mole-rat fibroblasts display hypersensitivity to contact inhibition, a phenomenon we termed \"early contact inhibition.\" Contact inhibition is a key anticancer mechanism that arrests cell division when cells reach a high density. In cell culture, naked mole-rat fibroblasts arrest at a much lower density than those from a mouse. We demonstrate that early contact inhibition requires the activity of p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways. Inactivation of both p53 and pRb attenuates early contact inhibition. Contact inhibition in human and mouse is triggered by the induction of p27(Kip1). In contrast, early contact inhibition in naked mole-rat is associated with the induction of p16(Ink4a). Furthermore, we show that the roles of p16(Ink4a) and p27(Kip1) in the control of contact inhibition became temporally separated in this species: the early contact inhibition is controlled by p16(Ink4a), and regular contact inhibition is controlled by p27(Kip1). We propose that the additional layer of protection conferred by two-tiered contact inhibition contributes to the remarkable tumor resistance of the naked mole-rat.",

Measurement of telomere length could provide important information on cell replication and proliferation state in cancer tissues. Telomere shortening and its potential correlation with downregulation of cell-cycle regulatory elements were studied by the examination of relative telomere length and methylation status of the TP53, P21 and P16 promoters in tissues from breast cancer patients. Telomere length was measured in 104 samples (52 tumors and paired adjacent normal breast tissues) by quantitative PCR. Methylation profile of selected genes was analyzed in all samples using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Our results demonstrated a significant shortening of tumor telomere regions compared with paired adjacent normal tissues (P<0.001). Similarly, telomere lengths were significantly shorter in advanced stage cases and in those with higher histological grades (P<0.05). Telomere shortening in cancer tissues was correlated with a different level of hypermethylation in the TP53, P21 and P16 promoters (r=-0.33, P=0.001; r=-0.70, P<0.0001 and r=-0.71, P<0.0001, respectively). The results suggested that inactivation of p16/Rb and/or p53/p21 pathways by hypermethylation may be linked to critical telomere shortening, leading to genome instability and ultimately to malignant transformation. Thus, telomere shortening and promoter hypermethylation of related genes both might serve as breast cancer biomarkers.",

Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify novel drugs that can efficiently kill HER2(+) BC and/or potentiate the effect of existing anti-HER2 therapies. We performed a lenti-viral shRNA kinome screen on non-adherent mouse Her2/Neu tumorspheres and identified TBK1, a non-canonical IκB kinase (IKK), as the most potent target [1]. TBK1 knock-down, or treatment with TBK1-II, a drug that efficiently inhibits TBK1 and its close relative IKKε (IKBKE), suppressed growth of human HER2(+) BC cells and induced cellular senescence. Senescence was associated with inhibition of phosphorylated/active p65-NFkB and induction of the cell cycle inhibitor, p16(ink4a). In addition, TBK1-II cooperated with lapatinib, a EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, to accelerate apoptosis in vitro and suppress tumor growth in a xenograft model of HER2(+) BC.

Homozygous deletion of exon 1 and exon 3 was observed in two and three cases, respectively, giving an overall frequency of homozygous deletion of 12.5 %. All five cases had diffuse type gastric carcinoma. No p16 gene point mutation was detected.;These findings suggest a close correlation between inactivation of p16 gene and gastric carcinoma.

Here, we analyzed genome-wide transcription profiling of an in vitro cancerous transformation process. We focused on a cluster of genes whose expression levels increased as a function of p53 and p16(INK4A) tumor suppressors inactivation. This cluster predominantly consists of cell cycle genes and constitutes a signature of a diversity of cancers. By linking expression profiles of the genes in the cluster with the dynamic behavior of p53 and p16(INK4A), we identified a promoter architecture that integrates signals from the two tumor suppressive channels and that maps their activity onto distinct levels of expression of the cell cycle genes, which, in turn, correspond to different cellular proliferation rates. Taking components of the mitotic spindle as an example, we experimentally verified our predictions that p53-mediated transcriptional repression of several of these novel targets is dependent on the activities of p21, NFY, and E2F. Our study demonstrates how a well-controlled transformation process allows linking between gene expression, promoter architecture, and activity of upstream signaling molecules.",

We report here that NPM regulates turnover of the c-Myc oncoprotein by acting on the F-box protein Fbw7gamma, a component of the E3 ligase complex involved in the ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of c-Myc. NPM was required for nucleolar localization and stabilization of Fbw7gamma. As a consequence, c-Myc was stabilized in cells lacking NPM. Expression of NPMmut also led to c-Myc stabilization because of its ability to interact with Fbw7gamma and delocalize it to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded. Because Fbw7 induces degradation of other growth-promoting proteins, the NPM-Fbw7 interaction emerges as a central tumor suppressor mechanism in human cancer.",

A fundamental cause of cancer is the alteration of the genetic material, which may modify the expression of proteins that play key roles in cell cycle progression. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of cyclins D1, E, and B1 and of the CDKIs p16 and p21 in a population of uniformly treated patients with stage I or II breast tumors (n=56) compared with patients with benign breast pathology (n=23). Malignant breast tumors showed higher cyclin E and lower p21 expression than benign breast pathology (NS), determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In breast cancer patients, overexpression of cyclins D1 and E was associated with the presence of ER and stage respectively independently of other prognostic variables (multivariate analysis). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that only overexpression of cyclin E was associated with a longer recurrence-free survival. Cox analysis showed that neither cyclins nor CDKIs were independent prognostic markers.

In the present study we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation to further characterize gynecomastia. A total of 46 cases of gynecomastia were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, HER2, androgen receptor, cytokeratins (CK5, CK14, CK7, and CK8/18), p63, E-cadherin, BRST2, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, p53, p16, p21, and Ki67. In addition, 8 cases of male ductal carcinoma in situ and normal breast tissue obtained from autopsies (n=10) and adjacent to male breast cancer (n=5) were studied. Normal ductal male breast epithelial cells were very often ER and Bcl-2 positive (>69%), and progesterone receptor and androgen receptor expression was also common (>39%). Gynecomastia showed a consistent 3-layered pattern: 1 myoepithelial and 2 epithelial cell layers with a distinctive immunohistochemical staining pattern. The intermediate luminal layer, consisting of vertically oriented cuboidal-to-columnar cells, is hormone receptor positive and expresses Bcl-2 and cyclin D1. The inner luminal layer is composed of smaller cells expressing CK5 and often CK14 but is usually negative for hormone receptors and Bcl-2. Male ductal carcinoma in situ was consistently ER positive and CK5/CK14 negative. In conclusion, for the first time we describe the 3-layered ductal epithelium in gynecomastia, which has a distinctive immunohistochemical profile. These results indicate that different cellular compartments exist in gynecomastia, and therefore gynecomastia does not seem to be an obligate precursor lesion of male breast cancer.",

Polymorphisms in the IL-1β gene (-31T>C and -511C>T) and the TNF-α gene (-857C>T) were genotyped in 385 cancer-free subjects. CIHM of four candidate genes: p16 (INK4a), p14 (ARF), E-cadherin (CDH1), and death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase), were determined by methylation-specific-polymerase chain reaction (MSP). CIHM high was defined as two or more CpG islands methylated. CIHM of all four genes and CIHM high were significantly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection status. In over all, significant marginal association was found between IL-1β-511 TT genotype and reduced susceptibility to CIHM of DAP-kinase (adjusted OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.29-0.78) and CIHM high (adjusted OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.32-0.86).

In this review, a brief update of molecular pathological markers of vulvar carcinomas is provided, and their impact as prognostic markers is addressed. p16, p21, p14, p27, cyclin A, cyclin D1, p53, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor alpha, HER-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been found to be important in the pathogenesis and/or progression of vulvar carcinomas.

However, due to the relative small number of studies reported for each molecular pathological marker, and the relative small number of vulvar carcinomas included and the lack of multivariate analysis in the majority of these studies, no conclusion regarding the prognostic value of these markers can be drawn.

We characterize an immune competent recurrent/metastatic HPV+ murine model of OPSSC which consists of four lung metastatic (MLM) cell lines isolated from an animal with HPV+ OPSCC that failed cisplatin/radiation treatment. These individual metastatic clonal cell lines were tested to verify their origin (parental transgene expression and define their physiological properties: proliferation, metastatic potential, heterogeneity and sensitivity/resistance to cisplatin and radiation. All MLMs retain expression of parental HPV16 E6 and E7 and degrade P53 yet are heterogeneous from one another and from the parental cell line as defined by Illumina expression microarray. Consistent with this, reverse phase protein array defines differences in protein expression/activation between MLMs as well as the parental line. While in vitro growth rates of MLMs are slower than the parental line, in vivo growth of MLM clones is greatly enhanced. Moreover, in vivo resistance to standard therapies is dramatically increased in 3 of the 4 MLMs. Lymphatic and/or lung metastasis occurs 100% of the time in one MLM line. This recurrent/metastatic model of HPV+ OPSCC retains the characteristics evident in refractory human disease (heterogeneity, resistance to therapy, metastasis in lymph nodes/lungs) thus serving as an ideal translational system to test novel therapeutics.

We looked for homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, CDKN2B (p15INK4B), and CDKN2C (p18) in 12 primary rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) specimens and in five cell lines established from this cancer type. By means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), we analyzed the presence of biallelic gene deletion or point mutation causing gene function loss. All the examined tumor cell lines (100%) and three of 12 (25%) primary tumors showed homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. Furthermore, no aberrant bands in primary tumors were detected via SSCP, suggesting the absence of mutations in the coding region. In all cases the deleted area at 9p21 also involved the CDKN2B gene. Conversely, no homozygous deletion or point mutations were detected when CDKN2C was analyzed.

We investigated CIMP and MSI status in colorectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX. Stages II and III sporadic colorectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant FOLFOX were included. Eight CpG island loci (CACNA1G, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, CDKN2A (p16), RUNX3 and SOCS1) and five microsatellite markers were examined. Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed according to CIMP and MSI status. A total of 322 patients were included: male/female 192/130, median age 61 years (range 30-78), proximal/distal location 118/204 and Stages II/III 43/279. CIMP status was high in 25 patients (7.8%) and 21 patients (6.5%) had MSI-high tumor. CIMP/MSI status was not significantly associated with DFS: 3-year DFS 100% in CIMP(-)/MSI(+), 84% in CIMP(-)/MSI(-), 82% in CIMP(+)/MSI(-) and 75% in CIMP(+)/MSI(+) (p = 0.33). Results of exploratory analysis showed that concurrent methylation at NEUROG1 and CDKN2A (p16) was associated with shorter DFS: 3-year DFS 69% in NEUROG1(+)/CDKN2A (p16)(+) versus 87% in NEUROG1(-)/CDKN2A (p16)(-) (p = 0.006). In conclusion, concurrent methylation of NEUROG1 and CDKN2A (p16) is associated with recurrence following adjuvant FOLFOX in Stages II/III colorectal cancer.",

Although clinical outcome correlates with distinct mutations in some cancer entities, treatment responses within these lesion-stratified subgroups still remain heterogeneous, underscoring the need for additional prognosticators. We previously demonstrated that defined genetic defects at the INK4a/ARF locus, which encodes the tumor suppressors p16INK4a and ARF, not only accelerated lymphomagenesis in the Emu-myc transgenic mouse but also interfered with treatment sensitivity. In this study, we take a nonbiased genome-wide approach to examine whether the responsiveness of these lymphomas can be further stratified based on cytogenetic information at diagnosis. Indeed, using spectral karyotyping, comparative genomic hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization in 38 primary lymphomas, we find recurrent cytogenetic alterations that refine the predictive value of INK4a/ARF lesions on drug responses in vivo: gain of chromosome 14, which was never detected in INK4a/ARFnull lymphomas, defined an ARFnull subgroup with superior treatment outcome. Gain of chromosome 6 was identified as a recurrent chromosomal aberration that predisposed ARFnull tumors to their subsequent INK4a loss during therapy. These data illustrate how cytogenetic information from cancer specimens might complement established prognostic markers and may improve anticancer treatment strategies.",

Although p16 is thought to function as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the cell cycle, it remains unclear why the genetic compromise of p16 predisposes to melanoma over other cancers. Here we describe a novel role for p16 in regulating oxidative stress in several cell types, including melanocytes. Expression of p16 was rapidly upregulated following ultraviolet-irradiation and in response to H₂O₂-induced oxidative stress in a p38 stress-activated protein kinase-dependent manner. Knockdown of p16 using small interfering RNA increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative (8-oxoguanine) DNA damage, which was further enhanced by H₂O₂ treatment. Elevated ROS levels were also observed in p16-depleted human keratinocytes and in whole skin and dermal fibroblasts from Cdkn2a-deficient mice. Aberrant ROS and p38 signaling in Cdkn2a-deficient fibroblasts was normalized by expression of exogenous p16. The effect of p16 depletion on ROS was not recapitulated by the knockdown of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and did not require Rb. Finally, p16-mediated suppression of ROS could not be attributed to the potential effects of p16 on cell cycle phase. These findings suggest a potential alternate Rb-independent tumor-suppressor function of p16 as an endogenous regulator of carcinogenic intracellular oxidative stress. Compared with keratinocytes and fibroblasts, we also found increased susceptibility of melanocytes to oxidative stress in the context of p16 depletion, which may explain why the compromise of p16 predisposes to melanoma over other cancers.",

The transition of gland-forming rectal mucosa via specialized urothelium-like cells at the dentate line to anal non-keratinized and finally perianal keratinized squamous epithelium implies a broad spectrum of tumor types, with most cancers exhibiting a mixture of different histological features. Moreover, secondary neoplasias extending into or metastasizing to the anal region need to be considered. Based on epithelial metaplasia at the transformation zone, poorly differentiated squamous anal carcinomas may show co-expression of both the squamous (CK5/6) and glandular type keratins (CK7). Since HPV infection of high-risk types (often 16 and 18) is etiologically associated with anal cancer, p16(INK4a) is highly sensitive and specific in the detection of high-grade anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasias (ASIN) and corresponding invasive squamous carcinomas. Diagnosis of secondary malignancies, including pagetoid extension into the anogenital region, requires the application of specific immunohistochemical marker panels.",

We present evidence that the overexpression of TBP-1 in various cell lines results in a sharp increase of both transfected and endogenous ARF protein levels. Moreover, this effect depends on the binding between the two proteins and, at least in part, is exerted at the post-translational level. We also show that the ARF increase following TBP-1 overexpression results in an increase in p53 protein levels and activity.

Cervical cancers arise through disruption of the pathways of p53 and the product of the retinoblastoma gene by the human papillomavirus oncoproteins E6 and E7. It is generally assumed that the same pathways are involved in human papillomavirus-induced carcinogenesis at other mucosal surfaces. However, the patterns of expression of cell cycle proteins targeted by human papillomavirus E6 and E7 in cancers from different anatomic sites have been inconsistent, due to either biologic or technological factors. In this study, 73 human papillomavirus, 16-positive cervical squamous cell carcinomas (35 from Australian and 38 from Chinese women) were analysed for the expression of p53, pRb, p16(INK4A), p21(CIP1/WAF1), p27(KIP1) and cyclin D1 by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry. Cervical cancers from Chinese women were found to be significantly more likely to overexpress p53, pRb, p21 and p27 than their Australian counterparts. These findings were compared with those from 31 human papillomavirus 16-positive tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas, all of Australian origin, tested using the same methodology. Comparisons of the tonsillar and combined cervical data showed that tonsillar cancers were significantly more likely to be p53-positive, whereas cervical cancers were significantly more likely to overexpress pRb, p16 and p27. When the tonsillar data were compared with cervical data from Australian women, the associations for p53 and pRb remained. These findings represent new evidence that the molecular pathways to human papillomavirus-induced mucosal cancer may be influenced by anatomic location and ethnicity.",

In our study, 5/20 samples demonstrated deletions of p16(INK4A) exon 1alpha. pRB overexpression was found in 20/20 samples, the expression was mainly observed in all layers of the epithelia, particularly in the basal layer where cells are actively dividing and aberrant pRB expression was found in 12/20 samples. Cyclin D1 and CDK4 overexpression was detected in 6/20 and 2/20 samples respectively in comparison to hyperplasias where both proteins were either not expressed or expressed at minimal levels (<10%). Strikingly, HPV was found to be present in all of our samples, suggesting that HPV plays a significant role in driving oral carcinogenesis. Notably, 17/20 of our samples showed more than one alteration in the pRB pathway, however, we did not find any significant relationship between the presence of HPV, homozygous deletion of p16(INK4A) and overexpression of pRB, cyclin D1 and CDK4. Collectively, this data demonstrates that alterations in the pRB pathway are a common event and involve the aberration of more than one molecule within the pathway.

While cellular senescence arrests the early phase of cell cycle without any detectable telomere loss or dysfunction. ROS is reported to contribute to induction of cellular senescence, as evidence by its premature onset upon treatment with antioxidants or inhibitors of cellular oxidant scavengers. Although cellular senescence is known to be implicated in tumor suppression, it remains unknown whether ROS initially contributed to be cellular senescence in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and their malignant counterparts. To clarify whether ROS induce cellular senescence in NHEKs, we examined the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the expression of cellular senescence-associated molecules in NHEKs, compared to in squamous carcinoma cells (SCCs). Hydrogen peroxide increased the number of cells positive in senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity in NHEKs, but not SCCs. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, especially p16(INK4a) was upregulated in NHEKs treated with H2O2. Interestingly, H2O2 suppressed the methylation of p16(INK4a), promoter region in NHEKs, but not in SCCs. Hydrogen peroxide also suppressed the expression of phosphorylated Rb and CDK4, resulting in arrest in G0/G1 phase in NHEKs, but not SCCs. Our results indicate that the ROS-induced cellular senescence in NHEKs was caused by the upregulation p16(INK4a) through demethylation in its promoter region, which is not detected in SCCs, suggesting that ROS-induced cellular senescence contributes to tumor suppression of NHEKs.

Despite increasing interest and extensive study, the mechanisms that link regulation of DNA synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis remain elusive.

However, the molecular basis of the ARF-B23 interaction is hitherto unclear. Here we show that a highly conserved motif in the B23 oligomerization domain is essential for mediating ARF binding in vivo. Mutagenesis of conserved B23 core residues (L102A, G105A, G107A) prevented B23 from interacting with ARF. Modeling of the B23 core indicated that substitutions in the GSGP loop motif could trigger conformational changes in B23 thereby obstructing ARF binding. Interestingly, the GSGP loop mutants were unstable, defective for oligomerization, and delocalized from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. B23 core mutants displayed increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We conclude that the functional integrity of the B23 core motif is required for stability, efficient nucleolar localization as well as ARF binding.",

Here we report that normal liver cells express only DeltaN-p73 transcript forms giving rise to the synthesis of N-terminally truncated, transcriptionally inactive and dominant negative p73 proteins. In contrast, most hepatocellular carcinoma cells express TA-p73 transcript forms encoding full-length and transcriptionally active p73 proteins, in addition to DeltaN-p73. We also show that together with the acquired expression of TA-p73, the 'retinoblastoma pathway' is inactivated, and E2F1-target genes including cyclin E and p14(ARF) are activated in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there was no full correlation between 'retinoblastoma pathway' inactivation and TA-p73 expression.

However, the biological function of ZNF313 remains largely undefined. Here we report that ZNF313 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that has a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, differentiation and senescence. In this study, ZNF313 is initially identified as a XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1)-interacting protein, which upregulates the stability and proapoptotic effect of XAF1. Intriguingly, we found that ZNF313 activates cell cycle progression and suppresses cellular senescence through the RING domain-mediated degradation of p21(WAF1). ZNF313 ubiquitinates p21(WAF1) and also destabilizes p27(KIP1) and p57(KIP2), three members of the CDK-interacting protein (CIP)/kinase inhibitor protein (KIP) family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, whereas it does not affect the stability of the inhibitor of CDK (INK4) family members, such as p16(INK4A) and p15(INK4B). ZNF313 expression is tightly controlled during the cell cycle and its elevation at the late G1 phase is crucial for the G1-to-S phase transition. ZNF313 is induced by mitogenic growth factors and its blockade profoundly delays cell cycle progression and accelerates p21(WAF1)-mediated senescence. Both replicative and stress-induced senescence are accompanied with ZNF313 reduction. ZNF313 is downregulated during cellular differentiation process in vitro and in vivo, while it is commonly upregulated in many types of cancer cells. ZNF313 shows both the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in epithelial cells of normal tissues, but exhibits an intense cytoplasmic distribution in carcinoma cells of tumor tissues. Collectively, ZNF313 is a novel E3 ligase for p21(WAF1), whose alteration might be implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including cancers. ",

In the present study, germ line polymorphisms in the folate- and methyl-associated genes, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), were analyzed in the same patient cohort to find a possible link between these genetic variants and p16 hypermethylation. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood of patients (n = 181) and controls (n = 300). Genotype analyses were run on an ABI PRISM(®) 7900HT sequence-detection system (Applied Biosystems), using real-time polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan chemistry. The results showed that the genotype distributions of the patient and control groups were similar. No significant differences in cancer-specific or disease-free survival of stage I-III patients according to polymorphic variants were detected, nor were any differences in cancer-specific or disease-free survival detected when patients were subgrouped according to the MTHFR or MTR genotype groups and dichotomized by p16 hypermethylation status in mucosa. However, patients with the MTRR 66 AA/AG genotypes were found to have a significantly worse cancer-specific survival when the mucosa were positive, compared with negative, for p16 hypermethylation (hazard ratio 2.7; 95% confidence interval 1.2-6.4; P = 0.023). In contrast, there was no difference in survival among patients with the MTRR 66 GG genotype stratified by p16 hypermethylation status. These results indicate a relationship between genetic germ-line variants of the MTRR gene and p16 hypermethylation in mucosa, which may affect the clinical outcome of patients with colorectal cancer.",

Curcumin, obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has potent anticancer activity. To date, no study has examined the interaction of PhIP with curcumin in breast epithelial cells. The present study demonstrates the mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits PhIP-induced cytotoxicity in normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). Curcumin significantly inhibited PhIP-induced DNA adduct formation and DNA double stand breaks with a concomitant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The expression of Nrf2, FOXO targets; DNA repair genes BRCA-1, H2AFX and PARP-1; and tumor suppressor P16 was studied to evaluate the influence on these core signaling pathways. PhIP induced the expression of various antioxidant and DNA repair genes. However, co-treatment with curcumin inhibited this expression. PhIP suppressed the expression of the tumor suppressor P16 gene, whereas curcumin co-treatment increased its expression. Caspase-3 and -9 were slightly suppressed by curcumin with a consequent inhibition of cell death. These results suggest that curcumin appears to be an effective anti-PhIP food additive likely acting through multiple molecular targets. ",

Some workers have failed to observe associations between CIMP and specific clinicopathological features of CRC, possibly because of the choice of genes used to define this phenotype. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the aberrant methylation of 6 genes implicated in CRC development was associated with the same phenotypic features of this tumour type. The MethyLight assay was used to provide quantitative estimates of MLH1, P16, TIMP3, P14, DAPK and APC methylation levels in 199 unselected colorectal tumours. The methylation of MLH1, P16, TIMP3 and P14 was highly concordant (p < 0.0001 for each pair) but that of DAPK and APC was not. An inverse association was observed between the methylation of APC and TIMP3 (p = 0.004). Methylation of the MLH1, P16, TIMP3 and P14 genes was associated with tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (p < 0.05), microsatellite instability (p < 0.001), BRAF mutation (p < 0.0001) and elevated concentrations of the methyl group carriers tetrahydrofolate (THF) and 5,10-methylene THF (p < 0.05). In contrast, APC methylation was associated with wildtype BRAF (p = 0.003) and with lower concentrations of methyl group carriers (p < 0.05). These findings highlight the importance of gene selection in studies that aim to characterize the biological features and clinical behaviour of CIMP+ tumours.",

Clonogenic cell assay, western blotting assay, 3'(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometer (FCM) assay, and immunocytochemical technique were designed to examine the inhibition of proliferation, protein expression of p14ARF and EGFR and induction of differentiation, respectively. Furthermore the synergistic effect of Ad-p14ARF and Ad-antisense EGFR on Hep-2 cell was examined. We successfully used AdEasy-1 vector system to construct recombinant adenoviruses Ad-p14ARF and Ad-antisense EGFR. The activity of proliferation of Hep-2 cells was inhibited markedly by infecting Ad-p14ARF or Ad-antisense EGFR by comparing Ad-sense EGFR (P=0.005) with vector control (Ad-Ctrl) (P=0.005) and with PBS (P=0.003). This effect, combining Ad-antisense-EGFR with Ad-p14ARF became more noticeable than alone (P=0.01, P=0.02, respectively). P14 ARF protein overexpression, EGFR protein down expression, and inhibition of proliferation were observed in Hep-2 cells infected by either Ad-p14ARF or Ad-antisense EGFR. FCM revealed that the proportion of apoptosis cells transfected by Ad-p14ARF and Ad-antisense EGFR increased more obviously than the control. The proportion of (Hep-2 cells in) G0/G1 phases was increased by up to 78.5, 77.7, and 86.9% in Ad-antisense EGFR, Ad-p14ARF, and Ad-antisense EGFR+Ad-p14ARF, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that not only EGFR but p14ARF also plays a major role on the genesis and in modulating the cell growth and differentiation of human laryngocarcinoma.

Human cells must breach at least two distinct senescence barriers to permit unfettered clonal evolution during cancer development: (1) stress- or oncogene-induced premature senescence (SIPS/OIS), mediated via the p16-Rb and/or ARF-p53-p21 tumour-suppressive pathways, and (2) replicative senescence triggered by telomere shortening. In contrast, because their telomerase is constitutively active, cells from small rodents possess only the SIPS/OIS barrier, and are therefore useful for studying SIPS/OIS bypass in isolation. Dermal fibroblasts from the Syrian hamster (SHD cells) are exceptionally resistant to spontaneous SIPS bypass, but it can be readily induced following exposure to a wide range of chemical and physical carcinogens. Here we show that a spectrum of carcinogen-specific mutational and epigenetic alterations involving the INK4A (p16), p53 and INK4B (p15) genes are associated with induced SIPS bypass. With ionizing radiation, immortalization is invariably accompanied by efficient biallelic deletion of the complete INK4/CDKN2 locus. In comparison, SHD cells immortalized by the powerful polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene display transversion point mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 coupled with INK4 alterations such as loss of expression of p15. Epimutational silencing of p16 is the primary event associated with immortalization by nickel, a human non-genotoxic carcinogen. As SIPS/OIS bypass is a prerequisite for the immortalization of normal diploid human epithelial cells, our results with the SHD model will provide a basis for delineating combinations of key molecular changes underpinning this important event in human carcinogenesis.",

Overexpression of the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is involved in the progression of malignant tumours. In this study, we examined the significance of EZH2 expression in IPNB and its association with clinicopathological features and the expression of p16(INK4a) , p53 and mucin core proteins.;  We examined immunohistochemically the expression of EZH2, p16(INK4a) , MUC mucin core proteins and p53 in 15 patients with IPNB without invasion, including the cystic variant [male/female ratio (M/F) = 9/6], and in 19 with IPNB associated with invasive carcinoma (M/F = 13/6). The expression levels of EZH2, p53 and MUC1 were significantly lower (P < 0.01), and of MUC6 were significantly higher (P < 0.05), in IPNB without invasion than in IPNB with invasion. Expression of EZH2 was significantly correlated with expression of MUC1 (P < 0.01) and inversely correlated with expression of MUC6 (P < 0.05). In cholangiocarcinoma cells (HuCTT-1 and TFK-1), knockdown of EZH2 and MUC1 by small interfering RNA decreased invasion and proliferation, whereas knockdown of MUC6 increased invasion.;  Overexpression of EZH2 may be associated with malignant behaviour in IPNB in parallel with up-regulated MUC1 expression and down-regulated MUC6 expression.",

Based on these lesions a risk for progression for an individual patient should be given. Therefore, prognostic biomarkers are necessary but unfortunately there are not so many prognostic biomarkers known. Among these is the detection of an HPV (human papillomavirus) infection in the case of cervical carcinomas or the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a). Human papillomaviruses are oncogenic DNA viruses, which represent the driving force of almost all cervical carcinomas and p16(INK4a) is an indicator of a premalignant state of epithelial cells which is known as oncogen-induced senescence (OIS). The epithelial cells are in an instable state which collapses in practically all cases, and leads to the progression of tumors. But also for later forms of neoplasia prognostic markers which have proven to be relevant in the daily routine are hardly known. A possible cause might be found in the complexity of the pathogenesis of solid tumors which is associated with a variety of functionally different subtypes. The knowledge of these subgroups should help to define biomarker signatures which might be used for the definition of precursor lesions.",

From July 1990 through December 1993, 117 consecutive patients with CRC underwent curative resection with radical lymphadenectomy. The resected specimens were examined immunohistochemically using monoclonal antibodies to identify abnormalities of pRb and p16 expression. The association of pRb and p16 expression status with clinicopathologic features was analyzed retrospectively. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors independently affecting survival after resection. The median follow-up period was 62 months. Aberrant expression of pRb and p16 was identified in 82 (70%) and 87 (74%) patients, respectively. Coincident abnormalities of these proteins occurred in 61 (52%) patients. Loss of pRb expression correlated with tumor site (P = 0.0119), whereas p16 overexpression correlated with tumor size (P = 0.0034). Coincident abnormalities of pRb and p16 were associated with TNM tumor stage (P = 0.011). The outcome after resection was worse in patients with aberrant expression of pRb and/or p16 than in patients with normally expressed pRb and p16 (for pRb, P = 0.0151; for p16, P = 0.0247). Coincident abnormalities of pRb and p16 indicated the worst patient survival (P = 0.0310). Aberrant expression of pRb and p16 independently affected postresection survival (relative risk = 6.312, P <0.0001; relative risk = 5.994, P <0.0001, respectively).

Recently we reported ethanol-induced proliferation in a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cell line, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In order to further clarify these findings, major G0/G1-regulating proteins were investigated in the present study. Synchronized cells of a SCCHN line (JP-PA) and a human immortalized keratinocyte line (HaCaT)-used as a control-were cultured with or without 10(-3) M ethanol for up to 96 h. At distinct time intervals the expression of cyclin D1 and the inhibitors p16, p18, p19 and p21 were determined by Western blot analyses. In both lines ethanol had no influence on the protein expression of cyclin D1. In contrast, distinct downregulations of p21, p18 and p19 were detectable at the protein level. The p16 protein was not expressed in the SCCHN line and was unchanged in the control line after the addition of ethanol. In these in vitro experiments the marked downregulation of important cell-cycle inhibitors may accelerate progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. The relevance of our findings to in vivo conditions remains speculative, but the observed mechanisms of significantly reduced expression of cell-cycle inhibitor proteins may be involved in the carcinogenesis of head and neck malignancies.",

This cross-sectional study was performed with 141 cervical samples from patients attending Hospital Moncorvo Filho, Rio de Janeiro. HPV detection and genotyping were performed through PCR and P16INK4A methylation by nested-methylation specific PCR (MSP). HPV frequency was 62.4% (88/141). The most common HPV were HPV16 (37%), HPV18 (16.3%) and HPV33/45(15.2%). An upward trend was observed concerning P16INK4A methylation and lesion degree: normal epithelia (10.7%), low grade lesions (22.9%), high grade (57.1%) and carcinoma (93.1%) (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate an association between methylation, age, tobacco exposure, HPV infection and genotyping. A correlation was found concerning methylation with HPV infection (p < 0.0001), hr-HPV (p = 0.01), HSIL (p < 0.0007) and malignant lesions (p < 0.0001).

But, no V600E mutation was identified in the BRAF gene in any sample. No association was found in cases showing epigenetic APC, ECAD, and p14 abnormality with the clinicopathological parameters under study. The association between KRAS mutations and the so called methylator phenotype was previously reported. Therefore, we also analyzed the association between the hot spot KRAS gene mutations in codons of 12 and 13 with genes' promoter hypermethylation in a subset of this group of patients. Out of 86 tumors, KRAS was mutated in 24 (28%) of tumors, the majority occurring in codon 12. KRAS mutations were not associated with genes' methylation in this tumor series. These findings suggest a distinct molecular pathway for methylation of APC2, p14, and ECAD genes from those previously described for colorectal cancers with BRAF or KRAS mutations.",

However, some studies have reported differences in the methylation frequencies of P16INK4a promoter between cancer and the corresponding control group. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to better identify the association.;PubMed, Ovid, ISI Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched to identify eligible studies to evaluate the association of p16INK4a promoter methylation and HNSCC.

The frequencies of p16INK4a promoter methylation in the cancer group were significantly higher than those in the control group (cancer group: median: 46.67%, range = 7.84%-95.12%; control group: median: 18.37%, range = 0-83.33%; respectively).

Human papillomavirus (HPV) has a proven role in squamous cancers, but has not been studied in genitourinary malignancies in transplantation. Of 2345 kidney transplants performed at our center over the past 20 years, we identified 16 patients with 20 genitourinary cancers (0.7%), including 13 bladder/ureter carcinomas, 5 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), and 2 prostate carcinomas. We performed immunohistochemical staining for polyomavirus large T antigen and p16, followed by in situ hybridization for HPV in p16+ cases. Four cases of high-grade invasive urothelial bladder carcinomas were positive for large T. Large T+ urothelial carcinomas developed at least 8 years posttransplant in young men, 3 with history of BK polyoma viremia, 2 of whom had native kidney failure due to reflux/obstruction. In situ hybridization for high-risk HPV was negative in all tested cases. Overall, 3 patients died of carcinoma. All 5 RCCs were negative for both large T and p16; 2 prostate cancers were p16 negative and p16+/HPV negative, respectively. Thus, our study shows a relatively high prevalence of large T antigen in urothelial carcinoma in kidney transplant patients (31%), but not in RCC. Although sample size is small, young patients with obstructive disease may be at particular risk for developing large T-positive urothelial carcinoma. Overall, our data further support the necessities of long-term cancer surveillance for renal transplant patients. ",

These changes in methylation may impair the proper expression and/or function of cell cycle regulatory genes and confer a selective growth advantage to affected cells. Detailed methylation analysis using genomic bisulfite sequencing was performed on a series of subclones of a bladder cancer cell line in which a hypermethylated p16 gene had been reactivated by transient treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript. Furthermore, we show that reactivant clones that expressed p16 at varying levels contained heterogeneous methylation patterns, suggesting that p16 expression can occur even in the presence of a relatively heavily methylated coding region. We also present the first functional evidence that methylation of only a small number of CpG sites can significantly down-regulate p16 promoter activity, thus providing support for the model of progressive inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene by DNA methylation.",

It is unclear, however, how ARF initiates its involvement in the p53/mdm2 pathway, as p53 and mdm2 are located in the nucleoplasm, whereas ARF is largely nucleolar in tumor cells. We have used immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation to examine how the subnuclear distribution and protein-protein interactions of ARF change immediately after DNA damage and over the time course of the DNA damage response in human tumor cells. We find that DNA damage disrupts the interaction of ARF with the nucleolar protein B23(nucleophosmin) and promotes a transient p53-independent translocation of ARF to the nucleoplasm, resulting in a masking of the ARF NH2 terminus that correlates with the appearance of ARF-Hdm2 complexes. The translocation also results in an unmasking of the ARF COOH terminus, suggesting that redistribution disrupts a nucleolar interaction of ARF involving this region. By 24 hours after irradiation, DNA repair has ceased and the pretreatment immunofluorescence patterns and complexes of ARF have been restored. Although the redistribution of ARF is independent of p53 and likely to be regulated by interactions other than Hdm2, ARF does not promote UV sensitization unless p53 is expressed. The results implicate the nucleolus and nucleolar interactions of the ARF, including potentially novel interactions involving its COOH terminus as sites for early DNA damage and stress-mediated cellular events.",

Aberrant CpG island methylation was detected in all ten genes analysed, and all but one sample displayed anomalies in at least one gene. The methylation index (number methylated genes/total genes analysed) was 0.3, 0.38, 0.33 and 0.29 for diffuse astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and secondary and primary glioblastomas, respectively. Some differences may be established regarding the methylation profiles of specific genes and tumor types: MGMT, THBS1, TIMP-3, and p16INK4A appear hypermethylated in low-grade tumors (at least in 45% of cases), whereas GSTP1, DAPK, and p14ARF are mostly changed in 15-50% of the higher grade forms versus <10% in low-grade tumors. Some variation also exists regarding the methylation values for p73 and RB1 (10-40% of cases) among all groups. TP53 presented hypermethylation rates <10% in all tumor subtypes. Our findings thus suggest that methylation represents a common mechanism that contributes to inactivating cancer-related genes in astrocytic neoplasms.

The present study found that ING1, in a variant-dependent manner, inhibited hepatoma cell proliferation and colony formation, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase, and postponed tumor formation in nude mice. Expression of p33(ING1b) and p24(ING1c) variants, but not p47(ING1a), was markedly reduced in HCC samples. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analysis revealed that ectopic overexpression of p33(ING1b) or p24(ING1c) variant increased the expression of p53 downstream genes such as p21(waf1) and bax, and repressed bcl-2 expression (P < 0.01), whereas p47(ING1a) inactivated p21(waf1) promoter (P < 0.01). Furthermore, we found that p33(ING1b) and p24(ING1c) repressed Mdm2 expression (P < 0.01) and competed with Mdm2 for binding to p53. Interestingly, p33(ING1b)and p24(ING1c) did not directly bind to Mdm2 protein but strongly increased p14(arf) expression (P < 0.01) and interacted with p14(arf) protein to stimulate p53.

We summarize these developments with an emphasis on the molecular characterization and the functional role of the cyclin-dependent kinase family of protein kinases (CDK) and their associated regulatory subunits. The Rb tumor suppressor in the progression from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle and in tumor development is used as a paradigm for illustrating the importance of understanding the molecular regulatory events in the etiology of cancer. Recent developments with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, most notably, p16 (CDKN2), indicate that these molecules represent new tumor suppressors in both skin and lung cancers. Insights from these cell cycle studies can provide avenues for the diagnosis, prognosis, and potential gene and chemotherapies for many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer.",

For prediction of prognosis, tumor cell kinetics is an important feature, traditionally evaluated by estimation of cell growth-associated parameters such as mitotic index, S-phase fraction and expression of proliferation coupled proteins, for example proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 antigen. Recent data indicate that deregulation of the cell cycle can occur at different levels in cancer and that the \"deregulation pattern\" can be of clinical significance. In the present overview we give a short description of approaches used for cell proliferation assessments, whereafter more recent data on cell cycle deregulation are discussed.

HPV infection was detected by PCR using SPF-10 primers and typed with the INNO-LIPA HPV assay and p16(INK4a) expression by immunohistochemistry. Disease-free and overall survival (DFS and OS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard's model.;HR-HPV DNA was detected in 70.2% patients. HPV16 was the most prevalent genotype (67.5% of cases). p16(INK4a) was positive in 97.5% HPV-positive and 17.6% HPV-negative tumors (p<.001). FIGO stage was associated with DFS (p=.042) and OS (p=.008). HPV-positive tumors showed better DFS (p=.042) and OS (p=.035) than HPV-negative tumors. Multivariate analysis confirmed better DFS and OS of HPV-positive patients independent of age and stage. This reduced risk of progression and mortality in HPV-positive patients was limited to women with FIGO stages I and II tumors (HR=0.26; 95% CI 0.10-0.69; p=0.006).;HPV-positive early stage (FIGO I and II) VaSCCs have a better prognosis than early HPV-negative tumors.

Several molecules such as retinoblastoma and p16 were raised as key factors in tumorigenesis and invasiveness. Estrogen-related pathways seem to be closely involved in the process. For the tumor lacking hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor 2, some other mechanisms could be responsible. It seems that MicroRNA 22 directing some putative targets such as SIRT1, Sp1 and CDK6 plays a crucial role in breast tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, ribophorin and the associated molecules might be engaged in breast cancer stemness. Obviously, these molecules provide potential for therapeutic targets. It was also discussed about new drug development such as anti-human epidermal growth factor 2 therapy, anti-angiogenesis, pro-tumor aspects of anti-cancer therapy and application of circulating markers for monitoring, imaging and health-care system. Furthermore, we discussed risk factors, prevention and screening to reduce invasive cancers as well.

In Western countries it is the fourth commonest cause of death from cancer after those of lung, colorectal, and breast. The incidence of pancreatic carcinoma has increased in Northern Europe and North America during recent decades and contrary to for example, lung, gastric and oesophageal carcinoma, its incidence is still increasing the annual incidence is about 8-10/100,000 population. The causes of its increased incidence are unknown, as is the aetiology of the disease itself. Pancreatic cancer generally grows without symptoms until late in its natural history and there are therefore many discouraging unresolved problems in management. However, some progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of pancreatic carcinogenesis. Recent molecular pathological studies have described mutation or overexpression of important oncogenes such as K-ras and bcl-2 and deletions of tumour suppression genes such p53, DPC4, CDKN2, and the Rb gene. The present prognosis of pancreatic cancer is, however, controversial, and as these new markers may have the potential for improving our ability to predict its course, we have reviewed current knowledge, and concentrated on the classic and the recently-introduced factors in the prediction of its prognosis.",

For both genes, there was a statistically significant difference in the methylation ratio between non-small cell lung cancer patients and controls (p16; p<0.01, ESR1; p<0.001). In addition, there was a strong correlation between the methylation ratio of each gene and old age (p16; p<0.01, ESR1; p<0.001 and p16 or ESR1; p<0.001), and between p16 or ESR1 methylation rate and smoking history (p<0.01). Moreover in Stage I cases, the methylation positive rate of each gene (p16, ESR1 and p16 or ESR1) was higher than the CEA positive rate (p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.001). Evaluation of p16 and ESR1 promoter methylation in blood using real-time PCR appears to be very useful for lung cancer diagnosis and there is some possibility that these methylated genes might come to represent useful biomarkers for the early detection of lung cancer.

Conflicting reports of the frequency of CDKN2 alterations in NSCLC tumors prompted us to examine the relationship of these alterations and those of the related gene, MTS2, with patient stage and site of cancer. One hundred twenty-five NSCLC samples (71 cell lines and 54 tumors) were examined by PCR-SSCP. Twenty of 71 (28%) tumor cell lines had homozygous deletions, and six (8%) had point mutations compared to 4 (7%) with point mutations among 54 tumor samples. All mutations were observed in tumors or cell lines from patients with stage III or IV disease. Two patients with no mutations in their primary tumor had a CDKN2 point mutation detected in a metastatic tumor. Point mutations were G:C to T:A transversion on the coding strand in five of 10 and resulted in nonsense mutations in seven of 10. Undetectable CDKN2 mRNA, in the absence of detectable genetic alteration, was noted in a similar fraction of cell lines derived from patients with stage I or II disease [two of seven (29%)] and stage III or IV disease [15 of 49 (31%)]. Homozygous deletion of MTS2 was found in 17 of 20 cell lines with CDKN2 deletions; no point mutations of MTS2 were identified by SSCP in the 125 samples. Thus, CDKN2 is a frequent target of genetic alterations at 9p21 in NSCLC. Both deletions and point mutations of CDKN2 are closely associated with tumor dissemination.",

The ability to maintain growth in TGF-beta was independent of telomere length and required catalytically active telomerase capable of telomere maintenance in vivo. The capacity of ectopic hTERT to induce TGF-beta resistance may explain our previously described gain of TGF-beta resistance after reactivation of endogenous telomerase activity in rare carcinogen-treated HMEC. In those HMEC that overcame senescence, both telomerase activity and TGF-beta resistance were acquired gradually during a process we have termed conversion.

Decreased MTAP expression is a prognosticator for poor outcome. Moreover, it seems that this deletion is more common in CRPC than in primary prostate cancer. We show for the first time that treatment with methylthioadenosine and high dose 6-thioguanine causes marked inhibition of a patient-derived neuroendocrine xenograft growth while protecting the host from 6-thioguanine toxicity. This therapeutic approach can be applied to other MTAP-deficient human cancers as deletion or hypermethylation of the MTAP gene occurs in a broad spectrum of tumors at high frequency. The combination of genome sequencing and patient-derived xenografts can identify candidate therapeutic agents and evaluate them for personalized oncology.",

A total of 85 penile HGSILs and 1010 penile invasive cancers diagnosed from 1983 to 2011 were included.;After histopathologic evaluation of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, HPV DNA detection and genotyping were performed using the SPF-10/DEIA/LiPA25 system, v.1 (Laboratory Biomedical Products, Rijswijk, The Netherlands). HPV DNA-positive cases were additionally tested for oncogene E6*I mRNA and all cases for p16(INK4a) expression, a surrogate marker of oncogenic HPV activity.;HPV DNA prevalence and type distributions were estimated.;HPV DNA was detected in 33.1% of penile cancers (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.2-36.1) and in 87.1% of HGSILs (95% CI, 78.0-93.4). The warty-basaloid histologic subtype showed the highest HPV DNA prevalence. Among cancers, statistically significant differences in prevalence were observed only by geographic region and not by period or by age at diagnosis. HPV16 was the most frequent HPV type detected in both HPV-positive cancers (68.7%) and HGSILs (79.6%). HPV6 was the second most common type in invasive cancers (3.7%). The p16(INK4a) upregulation and mRNA detection in addition to HPV DNA positivity were observed in 69.3% of HGSILs, and at least one of these HPV activity markers was detected in 85.3% of cases. In penile cancers, these figures were 22.0% and 27.1%, respectively.;About a third to a fourth of penile cancers were related to HPV when considering HPV DNA detection alone or adding an HPV activity marker, respectively.

It is a prodrug that is converted by several cytochrome P450 enzymes to a primary metabolite, N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDT), which is then further modified by CYP2D6 to a pharmacologically potent secondary metabolite, 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen (endoxifen). Antidepressants (ADs), which are often coprescribed to patients receiving tamoxifen, are also metabolized by CYP2D6 and evidence suggests that a drug-drug interaction between these agents adversely affects the outcome of tamoxifen therapy by inhibiting endoxifen formation. We evaluated this potentially important drug-drug interaction in vivo in mice humanized for CYP2D6 (hCYP2D6). The rate of conversion of NDT to endoxifen by hCYP2D6 mouse liver microsomes (MLMs) in vitro was similar to that of the most active members of a panel of 13 individual human liver microsomes. Coincubation with quinidine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, ablated endoxifen generation by hCYP2D6 MLMs. The NDT-hydroxylation activity of wild-type MLMs was 7.4 times higher than that of hCYP2D6, whereas MLMs from Cyp2d knockout animals were inactive. Hydroxylation of NDT correlated with that of bufuralol, a CYP2D6 probe substrate, in the human liver microsome panel. In vitro, ADs of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class were, by an order of magnitude, more potent inhibitors of NDT hydroxylation by hCYP2D6 MLMs than were compounds of the tricyclic class. At a clinically relevant dose, paroxetine pretreatment inhibited the generation of endoxifen from NDT in hCYP2D6 mice in vivo. These data demonstrate the potential of ADs to affect endoxifen generation and, thereby, the outcome of tamoxifen therapy.",

Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

Deletion of the p16 and p15 genes was assessed by Southern blot analysis, expression by Northern blot analysis, and mutation by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct sequencing. The methylation status of the 5' CpG island of the p16 gene was evaluated using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, and reversal of the transcriptional block of the p16 gene was determined by Northern blot analysis after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.;Homozygous deletions of the p16 and 15 genes from 2 of 9 gastric carcinoma cell lines were found. In contrast, no deletions were detected in 36 primary gastric tumors, and one primary tumor showed rearrangements of the p16 and p15 genes. Two gastric carcinoma cell lines showed a point mutation and an insertional mutation of the p16 gene, respectively; however, no point mutations were noted for the p16 and p15 genes in any of the primary gastric tumors. Constitutive levels of p16 mRNA expression in gastric carcinoma cell lines were quite heterogeneous; four gastric carcinoma cell lines had no detectable p16 mRNA and 6 gastric carcinoma cell lines had negligible expression of p15 mRNA. Of 10 primary gastric tumors, only 1 tumor expressed p16 mRNA. Furthermore, abnormal DNA methylation patterns of the p16 gene were found in 2 gastric carcinoma cell lines through the use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. These cell lines lacked expression of p16 mRNA without deletions of the p16 gene. These transcriptional blocks were reversed by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.;Deletions or mutations of the p16 and p15 genes are uncommon in primary gastric carcinomas.

Human tissue derived cell culture models exhibiting molecular similarities to clinical DCIS facilitate an important preclinical mechanistic approach for evaluation of preventive efficacy of natural and synthetic chemopreventive compounds. Natural phytochemicals present in fresh fruits, vegetables and grain products are likely to offer protection against cancer. The clinical efficacy of these natural phytochemicals, however, depends on extrapolation, and is therefore equivocal. The present study determined whether the natural soy isoflavone genistein (GEN) inhibited aberrant proliferation in 184-B5/HER cells (a model for human comedo DCIS) and identified possible mechanisms responsible for its efficacy. Human reduction mammoplasty derived HER-2/neu oncogene expressing preneoplastic 184-B5/HER cells represented the experimental system. Flow cytometry and cellular epifluorescence based assays were utilized to quantitate the alterations in cell cycle progression, cellular apoptosis, and in the status of cell cycle regulatory and apoptosis-associated gene product expression. The 184-B5/HER cells exhibited specific immunofluorescence to p185HER, p53, EGFR, but not to ERalpha, thus resembling comedo DCIS. Treatment of 184-B5/HER cells with GEN resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the viable cell population, increase in the G0/G1:S + G2/M ratio and enhancement of sub G0/G1 (apoptotic population). Exposure to the maximum cytostatic 10 microM dose of GEN down-regulated HER-2/neu mediated signal transduction as evidenced by a 73.9% decrease (p=0.001) in p185HER specific, and a 89.8% decrease (p=0.001) in phosphotyrosine specific immunofluorescence. The increase in G0/G1:S + G2/M ratio in response to the treatment with 10 microM GEN was associated with a 85.5% decrease (p=0.001) in immunoreactivity to PCNA and a 128.6% increase (p=0.004) in immunoreactivity to the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4. The induction of apoptosis by GEN was associated with a 52.8% decrease (p=0.001) in the immunoreactivity to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and with a 195.9% (p=0.001) increase in the immunoreactivity to proapoptotic Bax. Thus, preventive efficacy of GEN in HER-2/neu+/ER- 184-B5/HER cells may be due to its ability to down-regulate HER-2/neu mediated signal transduction, increase the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4, and induce Bcl-2 dependent apoptosis. These data provide evidence that GEN may be a potential chemopreventive lead compound for human comedo DCIS. The 184-B5/HER cells, may therefore, provide a high throughput mechanistic bioassay to identify new chemopreventive agents for human breast cancer.",

Treatment with YB-1 siRNA caused a marked suppression of cell proliferation and expression of a cell cycle related gene, CDC6 by cancer cells. Of cell cycle of cancer cells, S phase content was specifically reduced by knockdown of YB-1. The overexpression of CDC6 abrogated this inhibition of both cell proliferation and S phase entry. ChIP assay demonstrated that YB-1 binds to a Y-box located in the promoter region of the CDC6 gene. Expression of cyclin D1, CDK1 and CDK2 was also reduced with increased expression of p21(Cip1) and p16(INK4A) when treated with YB-1 siRNA. Furthermore, the nuclear YB-1 expression was significantly associated with the level of CDC6 nuclear expression in patients with breast cancer.

Mutations of p16 and FHIT genes in tumors were detected by direct sequencing.;The frequency of hypermethylation was 31.9% and 36.8% in p16 and FHIT genes, respectively, and showed significant harmony in concordant hypermethylation (P < .0001). In postmenopausal patients, methylation frequency in both genes is significantly higher in poorly and moderately differentiated tumors. Loss of protein expression of p16 and FHIT in 77 and 74 tumors, respectively, is associated with their methylation status in premenopausal women.;We did not find any significant differences in tumor-related gene methylation patterns relevant to both ER and PR status of breast tumors.",

Recently, genetic variations have been considered as important factors to cancer susceptibility and prognosis. More specifically, genetic polymorphisms have been associated with the development and prognosis of HNSCC. The purpose of the current study was to investigate an association among p16 (CDKN2A) gene polymorphism at rs11515, age, and HNSCC aggressiveness. PCR-RFLP analysis was used to investigate the p16 (CDKN2A) gene in 96 patients with HNSCC and in 100 individuals without HNSCC. A case group was categorized by age in younger (<60 years) and older (≥ 60 years) patients. Differences between the case and control groups were determined using Fisher and chi-squared tests. Time of survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up visit or to the date of death using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and comparing this to the log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. In the present study, no association was established between HNSCC and rs11515 polymorphism, as indicated in a previous study. We found that HNSCC individuals with large-sized tumors and with metastatic disease presented worse overall survival, consistent with fundamental concepts that establish the effects of tumor size and lymph node metastasis to HNSCC outcomes. This study identified that there is no difference in the distribution of rs11515 between the control and HNSCC groups. In addition, no differences between rs11515 genotypes and clinicopathological parameters were observed.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The activated RAS/RAF cascade plays a crucial role in lung cancer, but is also known to induce cellular senescence, a major barrier imposed on tumor cells early in tumorigenesis. MYC is a key factor in suppression of RAS/BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence in vitro. However, it is still unclear whether MYC has the same role during tumor development in vivo. Using a conditional, compound knock-in model of Cre-activated BRAF(V600E) and tamoxifen-regulatable MycER, we show that tamoxifen-induced activation of MYC accelerated the onset and increased the number and size of BRAF(V600E)-driven adenomas in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced survival. Furthermore, MYC activation leads to reduced expression of the senescence markers p16(INK4A), p21(CIP1), and H3K9me3-containing heterochromatin foci, and an increased percentage of Ki67(+) tumor cells. This suggests that MYC already early during tumor formation suppresses a BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence-like state. Initial activation of MYC followed by tamoxifen withdrawal still resulted in an increased number of tumors and reduced survival. However, these tumors were of smaller size, showed increased expression of p16(INK4A) and p21(CIP1), and reduced number of Ki67(+) cells, indicating that MYC inactivation restores BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence. Surprisingly, MYC activation did not promote adenoma to carcinoma progression. This suggests that senescence suppression by MYC is a discrete step in tumor development important for sustained tumor growth but preceding malignant transformation and that additional oncogenic events are required for carcinoma development and metastasis. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neoplastic transformation process, with implications for future treatment strategies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) plays an important role in the salvage pathway for the synthesis of adenosine. Novel chemotherapeutic strategies exploiting the selective loss of MTAP function in cancers have been proposed. The MTAP gene, on chromosome 9p21, is frequently included within homozygous deletions of the p16INK4A/ CDKN2A gene. Biallelic deletions of the p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene are found in 40% of pancreatic cancers, suggesting that the MTAP gene may be frequently inactivated in pancreatic cancer and that selected patients with pancreatic cancer may benefit from therapies targeting this loss. We immunolabeled six xenografted pancreatic cancers with known MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene status and found that immunolabeling mirrored gene status. Loss of expression of both MTAP and p16 was observed only in those pancreatic cancers with homozygous deletions that encompassed both the MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A genes. We then immunolabeled a series of 320 microarrayed infiltrating pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 35 biliary adenocarcinomas, 54 ampullary cancers, and 35 noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Immunolabeling for MTAP was lost in 91 of the 300 (30%) evaluable pancreatic cancers, 9 of 54 (17%) ampullary cancers, 4 of 33 (12%) biliary cancers, and in 1 of 35 (3%) IPMNs. All neoplasms with loss of MTAP labeling also demonstrated loss of p16 labeling. These results suggest that MTAP expression is lost in approximately 30% of infiltrating pancreatic cancers and in a lower percentage of other periampullary neoplasms, that this loss is the result of homozygous deletions encompassing both the MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A genes. Thus, pancreatic cancer is a promising cancer type in which to explore novel chemotherapeutic strategies to exploit the selective loss of MTAP function.",

However, the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in restoring abnormal DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated whether miRNA-29b, due to its complimentarity to the 3'- untranslated region of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and DNMT3B, could restore normal DNA methylation patterns in human breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that transfection of pre-miRNA-29b into less aggressive MCF-7 cells, but not MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal cells, inhibited cell proliferation, decreased DNMT3A and DNMT3B messenger RNA (mRNA), and decreased promoter methylation status of ADAM23 , CCNA1, CCND2, CDH1, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, HIC1, RASSF1, SLIT2, TNFRSF10D, and TP73 tumor-suppressor genes. Using methylation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and real-time PCR, we also demonstrated that the methylation status of several critical tumor-suppressor genes increased as stage of breast disease increased, while miRNA-29b mRNA levels were significantly decreased in breast cancers versus normal breast. This increase in methylation status was accompanied by an increase in DNMT1 and DNMT3B mRNA in advanced stage of human breast cancers and in MCF-7, MDA-MB-361, HCC70, Hs-578T, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as compared to normal breast specimens and MCF-10-2A, a non-tumorigenic breast cell line, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential for a new epigenetic approach in improving breast cancer therapy by targeting DNMT3A and DNMT3B through miRNA-29b in non-invasive epithelial breast cancer cells.

High DBC1 expression correlated significantly with favorable clinicopathologic variables. Furthermore, in survival analysis, the high-DBC1 expression group showed a better survival rate compared to the low-DBC1 expression group.

Forty-eight oral squamous cell carcinomas were included in the analyses. Deletion analysis was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mutation analysis was restricted to exon 1 and exon 2 of the p16 gene, previously shown to have a high incidence of mutations. The sequences containing exon 1 and exon 2 were amplified by PCR and screened with a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. Samples showing band shifts in SSCP were sequenced by PCR direct sequencing. Western blots were used to detect the protein expression of the p16 gene, and the results were evaluated with regard to their biological relevance in correlation with clinicopathological factors. Seven (14.6%) deletions were found; 5 (10.4%) mutations were discovered and located in different codons; 26 (54%) specimens had no p16 protein expression; in 11 specimens with p16 deletion or mutation, p16 protein could not be detected. One mutation was non-sense. The p16 gene alterations showed no relationship with location and clinical stage of cancer; however, a close relationship between p16 alterations and cancer metastasis to neck lymph node was found. The alteration rate gradually elevated from well to poorly differentiated grades. We perceive two results. First, the alterations of the p16 gene are common in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Second, the alterations of the p16 gene may attribute to the metastatic behavior or histological grade of cancer cells.",

In this study, using three human malignant glioma cell lines, MGR1, MGR3, and U87MG, we examined changes in gene expression of p16 and/or of its specific target CDK4 following damage of the cellular genome by the chemotherapeutic bifunctional alkylating agent, 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). Exposure of the cells to 50 mu M BCNU for 24 h induced a significant level of DNA interstrand cross-links in all cell lines. In MCR1 cells (p16(+), Rb+), over the 24 h period, a steady increase in p16 (mRNA and protein) and CDK4 (protein) was observed. The increase in CDK4 and p16 proteins occurred in parallel, and that the two proteins accumulated in complex with each other, resulting in marked inhibition of CDK4 kinase activity. In MGR3 and U87MG cells, both of which lack functional p16 protein (p16(-), Rb+), BCNU, however increased the CDK4 protein levels. In all three cell lines, despite the differences in p16 gene status, BCNU exposure caused significant blockade of the cells at G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. The coordinated enhancement of the target (CDK4) and the inhibitor (p16) in cellular response to genomic injury may reflect an attempt of the cells to continue progression through the cell cycle (via CDK4), while triggering the cell cycle arrest (via p16), required for the orderly repair of the damage to the genome.",

The p16 gene, however, is often found not be mutated or deleted and it has been suggested that hypermethylation of the CpG islands of the gene may be an alternative mechanism of gene inactivation. We sought to determine the levels of p16 abnormality in a series of epithelial ovarian carcinomas in an attempt to clarify the presently conflicting evidence of whether or not hypermethylation of the p16 gene plays a role in ovarian carcinogenesis. We analysed 57 primary ovarian tumours and their corresponding blood DNA using SSCP analysis, sequencing and the methylation specific PCR (MSP) technique. We found low levels of mutation (6.7% of malignant tumours) and no evidence of methylation in any of our samples, suggesting that neither mutation or hypermethylation of the CpG islands of the p16 gene play an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis.",

In our previous work, we have established that stimulation of the Kv11.1 potassium channel activates a senescent-like program that is characterized by a significant increase in tumor suppressor protein levels, such as p21waf/cip and p16INK4A. In this study we investigated the mechanism linking Kv11.1 stimulation to augmentation of p21waf/cip protein level. We have demonstrated that the Kv11.1 channel activator NS1643 activates a calcineurin-dependent transcription of p21waf/cip and that this event is fundamental for the inhibitory effect of NS1643 on cell proliferation.

The methylation status and histological features of the specimens were investigated.;In histologically normal squamous mucosa, no to low-level methylation (0-22%) was noted in some specimens at all genes except RARbeta2 (50%). Considerable variation in the incidence of methylation of these genes within and between cell lines and tumor specimens was noted. The highest incidences of methylation in the cell lines and primary tumors were noted in RARbeta2 (53%), MGMT (37%), p16 (33%), and DAP-K (25%); low incidence of methylations were noted in E-cadherin (2%), p73 (2%) RASSF1A (10%), and p14 (20%) genes.

Secondary cooperating genetic events are generally required for oncogene-induced tumorigenesis to overcome these biologic obstacles. We employed comparative genomic hybridization for eight genetically engineered mouse models of mammary cancer to identify loci that might harbor genes that enhance oncogene-induced tumorigenesis.;Unlike many other mammary tumor models, the MMTV-Myc tumors displayed few copy number variants except for amplification of distal mouse chromosome 11 in 80 % of the tumors (syntenic to human 17q23-qter often amplified in human breast cancer). Analyses of candidate genes located in this region identified JMJD6 as an epigenetic regulatory gene that cooperates with Myc to enhance tumorigenesis. It suppresses Myc-induced apoptosis under varying stress conditions through inhibition of p19ARF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein, leading to reduced levels of p53. JMJD6 binds to the p19ARF promoter and exerts its inhibitory function through demethylation of H4R3me2a. JMJD6 overexpression in MMTV-Myc cell lines increases tumor burden, induces EMT, and greatly enhances tumor metastasis. Importantly, we demonstrate that co-expression of high levels of JMJD6 and Myc is associated with poor prognosis for human ER+ breast cancer patients.;A novel epigenetic mechanism has been identified for how JMJD6 cooperates with Myc during oncogenic transformation. Combined high expression of Myc and JMJD6 confers a more aggressive phenotype in mouse and human tumors. Given the pleiotropic pro-tumorigenic activities of JMJD6, it may be useful as a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target for Myc-driven mammary tumorigenesis.",

Previous work has demonstrated that CDK4 expression is required for Neu-induced but not Wnt-induced breast tumorigenesis in mice. However, the role that CDK4 plays in ras-mediated breast tumor development is not well defined. To gain an understanding of the role of Cdk4 in ras-induced breast tumorigenesis, MMTV-v-Ha-ras transgenic mice were bred with Cdk4(+/neo) and Cdk4(R24C/R24C) mice to generate Cdk4(neo/neo):MMTV-v-Ha-ras, Cdk4(+/+):MMTV-v-Ha-ras, and Cdk4(R24C/R24C):MMTV-v-Ha-ras mice. The studies presented here demonstrate that Cdk4 expression is essential for Ras-mediated breast tumorigenesis. Surprisingly, the results also show that coexpression of mutant ras and Cdk4R24C genes in breast epithelial cells leads to an activation of senescent pathways that delay tumorigenesis. Analysis of the phosphorylated form of H2AX, a marker for DNA damage, indicated its increased presence in the tumors of Cdk4(R24C/R24C):MMTV-v-Ha-ras mice. These observations indicate that the increased apoptosis and senescence seen in breast tumors of these mice might be due to increased DNA damage response in cells expressing activated forms of ras and Cdk4(R24C).",

We previously detected an elevated ARMCX6 mRNA level in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells in which the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A products (p16INK4A and p14ARF) were silenced by RNA interference; however, the function of the ARMCX6 gene has yet to be determined. In the present study, we demonstrated that ARMCX6 tagged with green fluorescent protein was localized in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. ARMCX6 mRNA was highly detected in the pancreas and spleen, indicating a tissue-specific expression pattern in human tissues.

The association between protein expression and clinical parameters was evaluated by using Crosstabs method. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis.;There was at least triplicate 0.6-mm cores per sample, 4 cases of lung cancer were excluded for lacking of enough tissue. PML was found in the cytoplasm of 14.0% cases of NSCLC and of 39.1% SCLC (P=0.010), and in the nuclei of 31.4% NSCLC and 8.7% SCLC respectively (P=0.026). PML protein was present in 9 patients with SCLC and absent in 14 cases, 5-year cumulative survival rate of the patients was 50% and 23% respectively (Log-rank test, P=0.047). Lacking of PML protein and senior pathologic T-stage were two hazardous factors that influenced prognosis of SCLC. P53 expression was found in 33.3% lung cancer, and absent in benign tumors and normal tissues of the lung (P=0.038). P16INK4A expression was abolished in normal lung tissue, however, increased in lung cancer (28.5%), and especially in lung cancer with non- or poor differentiation (36.5%) and in SCLC (69.6%). There was inverse correlation between PML expression in the nuclei and P16INK4A expression, positive correlation between P53 and P16INK4A expressions in lung cancers. PML was negatively correlated with P53 in squamous cell carcinoma.;As an important suppressor of tumor, PML is related with P53 mutation in squamous cell carcinoma.

The study comprised 47 males and 26 females, aged 23-83 years (median 62 years), mostly (67 %) with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Of the tumors, 53 % arose in the nasal cavity, 42 % in the maxillary sinus, and 5 % in the ethmoid complex. The follow-up period ranged 1-241 months (median 19 months). HPV16, HPV18, or HPV35 were detected in 18/73 (25 %) tumors, 17 SCCs, and 1 small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. There was a strong correlation between results of HPV detection methods and p16 expression (p < 0.005). HPV-positive SCCs occurred more frequently in smokers (p = 0.04) and were more frequently p16-positive (p < 0.0001) and nonkeratinizing (p = 0.02), the latter occurring more commonly in nasal cavity (p = 0.025). Median survival for HPV-positive SCC patients was 30 months, while for HPV-negative SCC patients was 14 months (p = 0.23). In summary, we confirm that HR-HPV is actively involved in the etiopathogenesis of a significant subset of sinonasal SCCs. p16 may be used as a reliable surrogate marker for determination of HPV status also in sinonasal SCCs. Although we observed a trend toward better overall survival in HPV-positive SCCs, the prognostic impact of HPV status in sinonasal carcinomas needs to be elucidated by further studies.",

P16 immunostaining was found in 137 (40.8%) tumors, with 109 (32.4%) showing high level expression. All HPV positive (+) cases showed P16 high expression. P16 and Rb protein expressions were inversely correlated (P<0.001), suggesting that the high P16 expression is largely driven by non-HPV loss of Rb protein expression.

In select tumor types, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas, intragenic mutations are found in a significant percentage of cases. The immunoreactivity of mutant p16 proteins has not been comprehensively studied. Moreover, the immunohistochemical properties of commercially available antibodies have not been described in detail. We studied 35 pancreatic adenocarcinomas with a molecularly defined p16 status (16 homozygous deletions, 3 hypermethylated cases, and 16 tumors with an intragenic mutation in one allele associated with loss of the second allele). In addition, we studied nine cell lines (three homozygous deletions, three hypermethylated lines, and three intragenic mutations). Paraffin sections of the tumors and cell blocks were reacted with four different anti-p16 antibodies: polyclonal and monoclonal (clone G175-405) antibodies from PharMingen, monoclonal antibody DCS-50 from Oncogene Science, and monoclonal antibody ZJ11 from Neo-Markers. Optimal staining conditions were established for each antibody. The pancreatic carcinomas with homozygous p16 deletions were largely devoid of nuclear staining (admixed nonneoplastic cells served as internal positive controls); only one adenocarcinoma each reacted with DCS-50 and the polyclonal antibody, and five were positive with ZJ11, suggesting that nonspecific nuclear staining can occur under certain conditions. Antibody DCS-50 produced nuclear staining in all three hypermethylated carcinomas, whereas G175-405 stained none of them. Three of the four antibodies produced nuclear immunoreactivity in 7 to 14 of the 16 carcinomas carrying p16 mutations; G175-405 showed only weak reactivity in one case. Cytoplasmic staining was present in all carcinomas and cell lines and with all antibodies and therefore cannot be considered specific; it was strongest with G175-405. Thus, we found antibody G175-405 to be the most specific, and monoclonals DCS-50 and ZJ11 the least specific for wild-type p16.

Genetic imbalance was observed on 9q in 59% (24 of 41) of tumors informative for at least one locus. In contrast, only 13% (5 of 40) of informative tumors demonstrated a genetic alteration involving 9p. Furthermore, allelic loss on 9q was more common in late stage tumors (63%, 17 of 27) and poorly differentiated tumors (75%, 15 of 20) as compared to benign and early stage tumors (30%, 3 of 10). Evaluation of 15 tumors showing limited regions of genetic imbalance has identified 2 candidate tumor suppressor regions on 9q and 1 on 9p. Interestingly, the regions defined to 9p21-p24, 9q31, and 9q32-q34 all overlap with several known disease loci. In this aspect, the potential role of the CDKN2 gene at 9p21-p22 in ovarian carcinogenesis was assessed in an extended panel of ovarian tumors, 11 human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, and 1 cervical tumor cell line. With the use of comparative multiplex PCR, homozygous deletions were detected in 16 of 115 (14%) fresh tumors and 3 of 12 cancer cell lines. For those tumors demonstrating allelic loss for markers on 9p no somatic mutations were observed in the retained allele of CDKN2, as determined by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, but a mutation was observed in an additional cell line. Furthermore, CDKN2 mRNA levels were similar in the 9 cancer cell lines that retain CDKN2, as compared to normal human ovarian surface epithelial cell lines.

The data is to be compared with the use of vinorelbine which is a conventionally applied drug for advanced breast cancer patients.;The trucut biopsies of 35 metastatic breast tumour patients were obtained. The tissues were cultured for 24h. Capecitabine and vinorelbine were added according to the corresponding groups to be cultured by another 24h. Plain medium was added for control group. The two cell lines chosen were BT-783 and MB-MDA-231 to act as a reference group. The metabolic rate of the tissues and cell lines were measured by ATP bioluminescence assay and the proliferation rate was measured by WST-1. The level of COX2 and p16 after capecitabine and vinorelbine treatment was assessed with immunohistochemical methods.;One-way ANOVA revealed lower metabolic rate in test groups than control in cell lines and tumour tissues.

By using a glial-specific transgenic mouse system (RCAS/Ntv-a), we reported previously that IGFBP2 is an oncogenic factor for glioma progression in combination with platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGFB). Because the INK4a-ARF locus is often deleted in high-grade gliomas (anaplastic oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma), we investigated the effect of the Ink4a-Arf-null background on IGFBP2-mediated progression of PDGFB-initiated oligodendroglioma. We demonstrate here that homozygous deletion of Ink4a-Arf bypasses the requirement of exogenously introduced IGFBP2 for glioma progression. Instead, absence of Ink4a-Arf resulted in elevated endogenous tumor cell IGFBP2. An inverse relationship between p16(INK4a) and IGFBP2 expression was also observed in human glioma tissue samples and in 90 different cancer cell lines by using Western blotting and reverse-phase protein lysate arrays. When endogenous IGFBP2 expression was attenuated by an RCAS vector expressing antisense IGFBP2 in our mouse model, a decreased incidence of anaplastic oligodendroglioma as well as prolonged survival was observed. Thus, p16(INK4a) is a negative regulator of the IGFBP2 oncogene. Loss of Ink4a-Arf results in increased IGFBP2, which contributes to glioma progression, thereby implicating IGFBP2 as a marker and potential therapeutic target for Ink4a-Arf-deleted gliomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Senescence was originally identified by the finite lifespan of normal cells that is a consequence of telomere shortening with each cycle of DNA replication. Cells undergoing replicative senescence display pronounced morphological and biochemical changes such as flattening and/or enlargement, increases in p21(WAF1) and/or p16(INK4A), a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, and often senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Senescence also occurs in tumor cells in response to various forms of chemotherapy or radiation (therapy-induced senescence), which could be the basis for prolonged or (ideally) permanent growth arrest. Alternatively, therapy-induced senescence could represent a means whereby tumor cells evade the potential toxicity of chemotherapy and radiation, allowing for the eventual re-emergence or escape from senescence that could lead to disease recurrence. This review discusses the experimental data in the literature that support the premise that senescence is potentially reversible through the inactivation of p53, p16(INK4A) and/or Rb, over-expression of Cdc2/cdk1 and survivin, the development of polyploidy, the survival of cancer stem cells and/or restoration of the nuclear landscape. If senescence is truly reversible, then the re-emergence of tumor cells from senescent arrest induced by chemotherapy or radiation could represent a barrier to the development of effective and curative cancer therapies.",

Methylation of 5' CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes and elevated levels of the DNA-(cytosine-5)-methyltransferase enzyme (DNA MeTase) are also prevalent features of human neoplasia. However, direct evidence that elevated DNA MeTase levels alter gene expression and influence oncogenesis has been difficult to obtain, in part due to the lack of specific DNA MeTase inhibitors. Here we show that specific reduction of cellular DNA MeTase levels in human cancer cells with potent antisense inhibitors: 1) causes demethylation of the p16(ink4A) gene promoter; 2) causes re-expression of the p16(ink4A) protein; 3) leads to accumulation of the hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb); and 4) inhibits cell proliferation. Stepwise reduction of cellular DNA MeTase protein levels also induced a corresponding rapid increase in the cell cycle regulator p21(WAF/Cip1) protein demonstrating a regulatory link between DNA MeTase and the growth regulator p21(WAF/Cip1) that is independent of methylation of DNA. These results suggest that the elevated levels of DNA MeTase seen in cancer cells can inhibit tumor suppressors by distinct mechanisms involving either transcriptional inactivation through DNA methylation or by a methylation independent regulation.",

Twenty-eight tumours which were typed positive for HPV16 DNA, were comprehensively analysed for expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7, the status of the p53 gene, and the protein status of pRb and p16(INK4a). In a subset of cases, we have searched for integrated viral DNA, and have determined the genomic status of the E6 gene. Expression of E6/E7 was found in 12 tumours most of which were derived from the oropharynx, whereas p53 mutations were present in 13 tumours from various sites. The tumours either carried p53 mutations but did not express E6/E7, or they did express E6/E7 but were p53-wild-type. Coexistence of E6/E7 expression with a mutated p53 was found in only one case. Strikingly, in most p53-mutated tumours without E6/E7 expression, we found the E6 gene to be disrupted. E6/E7 expression was associated with reduced pRb and overexpressed p16(INK4a). Viral-cellular fusion transcripts were found in two cases. Our data demonstrate that HPV16 DNA-positivity in head and neck cancers is not indicative of a causal role.

Here, we present an analysis of 86 transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for inactivation of this locus. Multiplex quantitative PCR analysis for five microsatellites around the locus showed that 34 tumors (39%) had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) generally encompassing the entire region. Of these, 17 tumors (20%) carried homozygous deletions of at least one CDKN2A exon and of flanking microsatellites, as detected by quantitative PCR. Analysis by restriction enzyme PCR and methylation-specific PCR showed that only three specimens, each with LOH across 9p21, had bona fide hypermethylation of the CDKN2A exon 1alpha CpG-island in the remaining allele. Like most other specimens, these three specimens displayed substantial genome-wide hypomethylation of DNA as reflected in the methylation status of LINE L1 sequences. The extent of DNA hypomethylation was significantly more pronounced in TCC with LOH and/or homozygous deletions at 9p21 than in those without (26% and 28%, respectively, on average, versus 11%, p < 0.0015). No association of LOH or homozygous deletions at 9p21 with tumor stage or grade was found. The data indicate that DNA hypermethylation may be rare in TCC and that deletions are the most important mechanism for inactivation of the CDKN2A locus. The predominance of allelic loss may be explained by its correlation with genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, which is thought to favor chromosomal instability and illegitimate recombination.",

In the current study, we demonstrate an inhibitory effect of S100A4 on β-catenin signaling in breast cancer cells. By overexpressing S100A4 in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, we observed the down-regulation of β-catenin expression and β-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF transcriptional activities. The activity of GSK3β, which phosphorylates β-catenin and induces proteasomal degradation of β-catenin, was increased in S100A4-overexpressing cell lines. Blocking Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK3β) activity by lithium chloride or Dvl gene overexpression restored β-catenin expression. We also found that increased GSK3β activity was due to decrease in Akt activity resulting from Egr-1-induced phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression. S100A4 induced Egr-1 nuclear localization by increasing the association between Egr-1 and importin-7 and this effect was reduced in S100A4 mutants that harbored a defect in nuclear localization signals.

We report a 43-year-old man affected with NS, who developed several squamous and basal cell carcinomas on the face, ears and scalp and papillomatous lesions of hips, groin and genitoanal area. Molecular analysis of the SPINK5 gene revealed homozygosity for the recurrent mutation c.238dupG.

We have previously shown that Sall2 activates the transcription of tumor suppressor gene p21 and suppresses tumorigenesis through cell cycle inhibition and induction of apoptosis. To investigate additional Sall2-regulated downstream genes, we analyzed the differences in mRNA expression profiles with and without exogenously expressed Sall2. We identified 1616 Sall2-responsive genes through gene expression arrays. Promoter-reporter assays of p16(INK4A) and several other tumor-related genes indicated that the Sall2 regulation of these promoters was not significantly different between the two major forms of Sall2 with alternative exon 1 or exon 1A. Additional analysis showed that Sall2-induced p16 promoter activation was Sall2 dose-dependent. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the p16 promoter identified a consensus Sall2 binding site (GGGTGGG) proximal to the p16 transcription start site and was critical for p16 promoter activation. Finally, to confirm the significance of Sall2-activated p16 expression in cell cycle regulation, we co-transfected the SKOV3 cells with a Sall2 expression construct and a p16 minigene and also co-transfected the ES-2 cells with a Sall2 expression construct and the siRNA against p16 for flow cytometry analysis. Our results showed that Sall2 enhanced the p16 minigene blocking of cell cycle progression and p16 knockdown with siRNA abolished most of the Sall2 inhibition of cell cycle progression. These findings indicate that Sall2 targets multiple cell cycle regulators, including p16, through their promoters, adding knowledge to the understanding of Sall2 and p16 gene regulation, and how Sall2 deregulation may promote cancer formation.",

In all, 41 melanoma patients (stage I = 18; stage II = 10; stage III/IV = 13), 13 healthy controls without nevi, and 10 individuals with more than 15 nevi of >5 mm in size were investigated. For comparison, sera from patients with other skin tumors (nine basal cell cancers, five Kaposi's sarcoma), different metastasized cancers (five breast cancers, five colon cancers), and several chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 12) were also analyzed. In addition, we examined if methylation was involved in silencing transcription of these genes in 12 melanoma specimens. SOCS1, SOCS2, RASSF1a, CDKN2a, and MGMT were methylated in 75, 43, 64, 75, and 64% of melanoma samples, respectively. Of the 41 melanoma patients, 83% had one hypermethylated gene, while 66, 51, and 41% had two, three, or four hypermethylated genes, respectively. Also, 20% of these patients showed hypermethylation for all genes, while only 17% showed no methylation. Importantly, the methylation profile of the selected genes from melanoma patients was distinct from the other analyzed tumors. Transcription of SOCS1, SOCS2, CDKN2a, and RASSF1a genes was significantly reduced in fresh melanoma samples, while MGMT showed a 12-fold upregulation at the messenger ribonucleic acid level (P < 0.001).

        "Doc_abstract":"The interaction of nuclear and mitochondrial genes is an essential feature in maintenance of normal cellular function. Of 82 structural subunits that make up the oxidative phosphorylation system in the mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 subunits and rest of the subunits are encoded by nuclear DNA. Mutations in mitochondrial genes encoding the 13 subunits have been reported in a variety of cancers. However, little is known about the nuclear response to impairment of mitochondrial function in human cells.;We isolated a Rho0 (devoid of mtDNA) derivative of a breast cancer cell line. Our study suggests that depletion of mtDNA results in oxidative stress, causing increased lipid peroxidation in breast cancer cells. Using a cDNA microarray we compared differences in the nuclear gene expression profile between a breast cancer cell line (parental Rho+) and its Rho0 derivative impaired in mitochondrial function. Expression of several nuclear genes involved in cell signaling, cell architecture, energy metabolism, cell growth, apoptosis including general transcription factor TFIIH, v-maf, AML1, was induced in Rho0 cells. Expression of several genes was also down regulated. These include phospholipase C, agouti related protein, PKC gamma, protein tyrosine phosphatase C, phosphodiestarase 1A (cell signaling), PIBF1, cytochrome p450, (metabolism) and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p19, and GAP43 (cell growth and differentiation).;Mitochondrial impairment in breast cancer cells results in altered expression of nuclear genes involved in signaling, cellular architecture, metabolism, cell growth and differentiation, and apoptosis. These genes may mediate the cross talk between mitochondria and the nucleus.",

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 gene, mapped on chromosome 9p21, is presumed to be the tumor-suppressor gene localized in this chromosome. The aim of our study was to determine, in 26 Barrett's adenocarcinomas and 20 squamous-cell carcinomas of the esophagus, the prevalence of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9 by typing of microsatellite loci and mutation of p16 by direct sequencing of exons 1 and 2. Allelic losses were found in 69% of adenocarcinomas, but only a microdeletion in exon 1 of p16 occurred in 1 tumor. Among squamous-cell carcinomas, 65% had allelic losses and 5 tumors were mutated on the p16 gene (1 deletion, 3 nucleotide substitutions and 1 insertion). The relatively low rate of p16 mutation observed here coupled with the high frequency of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9 suggests that one or several tumor-suppressor gene(s) distinct from p16 may be the target(s) of allelic deletion in most esophageal cancers or that p16 is inactivated in another way.",

We now propose that the mechanism of p14ARF action may involve the covalent modification of its binding partners with the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO-1. In particular, we demonstrate that p14ARF interacts with the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme, Ubc9 and enhances the sumoylation of its binding partners, hdm2, E2F-1, HIF-1alpha, TBP-1 and p120E4F. Furthermore, p14ARF-induced sumoylation is abrogated by a subset of melanoma-associated p14ARF mutations.

In this study, the effect of loss of RECK function was assessed in various ways and cell systems. Successive cell cultivation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) according to 3T3 protocol revealed that the germline knockout of RECK confers accelerated cell proliferation and early escape from cellular senescence associated with downregulation of p19(Arf), Trp53 and p21(Cdkn1a). In contrast, short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of RECK induced irreversible growth arrest along with several features of the Arf, Trp53 and Cdkn1a-dependent cellular senescence. Within 2 days of RECK depletion, we observed a transient increase in protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation associated with an upregulated expression of cyclin D1, p19(Arf), Trp53, p21(Cdkn1a) and Sprouty 2. On further cultivation, RAS, AKT and ERK activities were then downregulated to a level lower than control, indicating that RECK depletion leads to a negative feedback to RAS signaling and subsequent cellular senescence. In addition, we observed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity was transiently upregulated by RECK depletion in MEFs, and continuously downregulated by RECK overexpression in colon cancer cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a novel modulator of EGFR signaling.",

Moreover, both Ad5CMV-p16 and Ad5CMV up-regulated the expression of glutathione-S-transferase P1.

The retinoblastoma (Rb)/p16 tumor suppressive pathway is deregulated in most cancers. Loss of p16 occurs more frequently than Rb loss, suggesting that p16 suppresses cancer by regulating Rb as well as the related proteins p107 and p130. However, direct evidence demonstrating that p130 or p107 cooperate with Rb to suppress epithelial cancers associated with p16 loss is currently lacking. Moreover, the roles of p130 and p107 in lung cancer are not clear. In the present studies, Rb ablation was targeted to the lung epithelium in wild-type, p107, or p130 null mice to determine unique and overlapping Rb family functions critical in tumor suppression. Rb ablation during development resulted in marked epithelial abnormalities despite p107 upregulation. In contrast, p130 and p107 were not required during development but had distinct functions in the Rb-deficient epithelium: p107 was required to suppress proliferation, whereas a novel proapoptotic function was identified for p130. Adult Rb-ablated lungs lacked the epithelial phenotype seen at birth and showed compensatory p107 upregulation and p16 induction in epithelial cell lineages that share phenotypic characteristics with human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that frequently show p16 loss. Importantly, Rb/p107-deficient, but not Rb/p130-deficient, lungs developed tumors resembling NSCLC. Taken together, these studies identify distinct Rb family functions critical in controlling epithelial cell growth, and provide direct evidence that p107 cooperates with Rb to protect against a common adult cancer.",
