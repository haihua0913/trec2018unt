Rearrangements of these three genes exist predominantly in lung adenocarcinoma while rarely in non-adenocarcinoma. Our objective was to explore the frequency, clinicopathological characteristics and survival of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients.;ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements were screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in patients with completely resected non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. All positive samples were confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank for comparison.;A total of 385 patients underwent complete resection, including squamous cell carcinoma (n = 245), adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 85) and large cell carcinoma (n = 55). Twelve of them were identified as harboring fusion genes, including ALK (n = 7), ROS1 (n = 3) and RET (n = 2) rearrangements. The fusion frequencies of adenosquamous, squamous cell and large cell carcinomas were 8.2%, 1.6% and 1.8% respectively. Their median age was 49.5 years and 3 of them had a smoking history. No survival difference existed between fusion gene positive and negative patients (36.7 vs.50.2 months, P = 0.21).;The frequencies of ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements are low in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients. And their clinical characteristics are similar to those in lung adenocarcinoma. Fusions of the above three genes are not prognostic factor for non-adnocarcinoma NSCLC patients.",

In the present study, we elucidated the apoptotic mechanism of PPARgamma activation in human lung cancers by using a novel PPARgamma agonist, 1-(trans-methylimino-N-oxy)-6-(2-morpholinoethoxy)-3-phenyl-(1H-indene-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (KR-62980), and rosiglitazone. PPARgamma activation selectively inhibited cell viability of non-small-cell lung cancer with little effect on small-cell lung cancer and normal lung cells. The cell death induced by PPARgamma activation presented apoptotic features of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in A549 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was accompanied by increased expression of proline oxidase (POX), a redox enzyme expressed in mitochondria, upon incubation with the agonists. POX RNA interference treatment blocked PPARgamma-induced ROS formation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that POX plays a functional role in apoptosis through ROS formation. The apoptotic effects by the agonists were antagonized by bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a PPARgamma antagonist, and by knockdown of PPARgamma expression, indicating the involvement of PPARgamma in these actions. The results of the present study suggest that PPARgamma activation induces apoptotic cell death in non-small-cell lung carcinoma mainly through ROS formation via POX induction.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is characterized by resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, which might explain the survival of lung cancer cells following treatment. Recently we have shown that the broad-range kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS) reactivates the apoptotic machinery in U1810 NSCLC cells [Joseph et al., Oncogene 21 (2002) 65]. Lately, several STS analogs that are more specific in kinase inhibition have been suggested for tumor treatment. In this study the apoptosis-inducing ability of the STS analogs PKC 412 and Ro 31-8220 used alone or in combination with DNA-damaging agents in U1810 cells was investigated. In these cells Ro 31-8220 neither induced apoptosis when used alone, nor sensitized cells to etoposide treatment. PKC 412 as a single agent induced death of a small number of U1810 cells, whereas it efficiently triggered a dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in U1285 small cell lung carcinoma cells. In both cell types PKC 412 triggered release of mitochondrial proteins followed by caspase activation. However, concomitant activation of a caspase-independent pathway was essential to kill NSCLC cells. Importantly, PKC 412 was able to sensitize etoposide- and radiation-induced death of U1810 cells. The best sensitization was achieved when PKC 412 was administered 24 h after treatments. In U1810 cells, Ro 31-8220 decreased PMA-induced ERK phosphorylation as efficiently as PKC 412, indicating that the failure of Ro 31-8220 to induce apoptosis was not due to weaker inhibition of conventional and novel PKC isoforms. However, Ro 31-8220 increased the basal level of ERK and Akt phosphorylation in both cell lines, whereas Akt phosphorylation was suppressed in the U1810 cells, which might influence apoptosis. These results suggest that PKC 412 could be a useful tool in increasing the efficiency of therapy of NSCLC.",

More recently, low-frequency rearrangements of TRK kinases have been described in NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Spitzoid melanoma. Entrectinib, whose discovery and preclinical characterization are reported herein, is a novel, potent inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and, importantly, of TRK family kinases, which shows promise for therapy of tumors bearing oncogenic forms of these proteins. Proliferation profiling against over 200 human tumor cell lines revealed that entrectinib is exquisitely potent in vitro against lines that are dependent on the drug's pharmacologic targets. Oral administration of entrectinib to tumor-bearing mice induced regression in relevant human xenograft tumors, including the TRKA-dependent colorectal carcinoma KM12, ROS1-driven tumors, and several ALK-dependent models of different tissue origins, including a model of brain-localized lung cancer metastasis. Entrectinib is currently showing great promise in phase I/II clinical trials, including the first documented objective responses to a TRK inhibitor in colorectal carcinoma and in NSCLC. The drug is, thus, potentially suited to the therapy of several molecularly defined cancer settings, especially that of TRK-dependent tumors, for which no approved drugs are currently available.

A total of 253 serum samples obtained from 37 healthy persons, 45 patients with benign lung diseases, 124 patients with lung cancer (42 with small cell lung cancer, 23 with adenocarcinoma, 21 with squamous cell carcinoma, 11 with large cell carcinoma, and 27 with unknown histology), 34 with lung metastases, 7 patients with sarcoma and 6 patients with malign lymphatic diseases were stored at -80 degrees C and assayed retrospectively. The intra- and inter-assay imprecisions were lower for the automatized test systems than for the RIA. Correlation between the EIA's and the RIA was better for NSE (Ro) than for NSE (BM) (BM/Ph: r = 0.93 and slope = 0.54; Ro/Ph: r = 0.95, slope = 0.79), but weaker than the correlation between the two EIA's: over the whole range r = 0.96, neuron-specific enolase < 50 micrograms/l: r = 0.97, neuron-specific enolase < 20 micrograms/l: r = 0.92. Fixing the specificity at 95% versus benign lung diseases we found a cut off value of 11.9 micrograms/l for NSE RIA (Ph), 15.9 micrograms/l for NSE EIA (BM) and 13.5 micrograms/l for NSE EIA (Ro). Based on this specificity of 95% versus benign lung diseases as the clinically relevant reference group, the sensitivity for NSE RIA was 32% for all lung cancer and 45% for small cell lung cancer, for NSE EIA (BM) 35% for all lung cancer and 43% for small cell lung cancer, the NSE EIA (Ro) had a sensitivity of 42% for all lung cancer and 57% for small cell lung cancer. In a follow-up study of two patients with small cell lung cancer a good comparability for all three assays in the kinetics, but a marked difference in the neuron-specific enolase value levels was found.

Histological and genotypic assessment of multifocal lung tumors have been suggested to influence the staging. The aim of this study was to determine the role of morphology and genotype in staging of surgically treated multifocal non-small cell lung carcinoma. Synchronous lung cancers from 60 patients (42 with adenocarcinoma and 18 with squamous cell carcinoma), clinically considered to represent intrapulmonary metastases, were histologically subtyped according to the 2015 World Health Organization classification of lung tumors and subjected to genotypic analysis (KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, MET and ROS1 in adenocarcinoma and PIK3CA and p16 in squamous cell carcinoma). Concordance between clinical criteria and histological subtyping was identified in about 50% of cases (P<0.0001). Genotypically, 44% of adenocarcinomas and 60% of squamous cell carcinomas with identified molecular alterations were considered to be intrapulmonary metastases. Concordance between histological and molecular staging was observed in 89% of adenocarcinomas and 56% of squamous cell carcinomas. Univariate survival analyses failed to demonstrate significant differences in overall or cancer-specific survival in patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomas restaged according to histology and/or molecular profile. Lymph node metastases (N1/N2 vs N0) (P=0.03) and age >65 years (P=0.05) were associated with shorter overall survival. In addition, squamous cell carcinomas with p16 deletion showed shorter overall survival when compared with squamous cell carcinomas without p16 deletion (P=0.05). No correlation between other molecular alterations, clinico-pathological characteristics and prognosis was found. Our study demonstrates that a comprehensive genotypic and morphological assessment of surgically treated multifocal lung cancers is feasible but not sufficient to establish their clonal relationship and prognosis.

Firstly, it is confirmed that matrine induces apoptosis of human NSCLC cells with anti-apoptotic factors inhibited and dependent on caspase activity. In addition, we found that matrine increases the phosphorylation of p38 but not its total protein, and inhibition of the p38 pathway with SB202190 partially prevents matrine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, matrine generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which is reversed by pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Additionally, inhibition of cell proliferation and increase of phosphorylation of p38 was also partially reversed by NAC. Collectively, matrine activates p38 pathway leading to a caspase-dependent apoptosis by inducing generation of ROS in NSCLC cells and may be a potential chemical for NSCLC. ",

The Hh signaling pathway has been one of the most intensely investigated targets for cancer therapy, and a number of compounds inhibiting Hh signaling are being tested clinically for treating many cancers. Lung cancer causes more deaths than the next three most common cancers (colon, breast, and prostate) combined. Cyclopamine was the first compound found to inhibit Hh signaling and has been invaluable for understanding the function of Hh signaling in development and cancer. To find novel strategies for combating lung cancer, we decided to characterize the effect of cyclopamine tartrate (CycT), an improved analogue of cyclopamine, on lung cancer cells and its mechanism of action.;The effect of CycT on oxygen consumption and proliferation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines was quantified by using an Oxygraph system and live cell counting, respectively. Apoptosis was detected by using Annexin V and Propidium Iodide staining. CycT's impact on ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology in NSCLC cells was monitored by using fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy. Western blotting and fluorescent microscopy were used to detect the levels and localization of Hh signaling targets, mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, and heme-related proteins in various NSCLC cells.;Our findings identified a novel function of CycT, as well as another Hh inhibitor SANT1, to disrupt mitochondrial function and aerobic respiration. Our results showed that CycT, like glutamine depletion, caused a substantial decrease in oxygen consumption in a number of NSCLC cell lines, suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis. Further, we found that CycT increased ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby disrupting mitochondrial function in NSCLC cells.;Together, our work demonstrates that CycT, and likely other Hh signaling inhibitors, can interrupt NSCLC cell function by promoting mitochondrial fission and fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and ROS generation, thereby diminishing mitochondrial respiration, suppressing cell proliferation, and causing apoptosis. Our work provides novel mechanistic insights into the action of Hh inhibitors in cancer cells.",

However, acquired resistance to targeted therapies invariably arises and is a major limitation to patient care. ROS1 fusion proteins are a recently described class of oncogenic driver, and NSCLC patients that express these fusions generally respond well to ROS1-targeted therapy. In this study, we sought to determine mechanisms of acquired resistance to ROS1 inhibition. To accomplish this, we analyzed tumor samples from a patient who initially responded to the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib but eventually developed acquired resistance. In addition, we generated a ROS1 inhibition-resistant derivative of the initially sensitive NSCLC cell line HCC78. Previously described mechanisms of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors including target kinase-domain mutation, target copy number gain, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and conversion to small cell lung cancer histology were found to not underlie resistance in the patient sample or resistant cell line. However, we did observe a switch in the control of growth and survival signaling pathways from ROS1 to EGFR in the resistant cell line. As a result of this switch, ROS1 inhibition-resistant HCC78 cells became sensitive to EGFR inhibition, an effect that was enhanced by co-treatment with a ROS1 inhibitor. Our results suggest that co-inhibition of ROS1 and EGFR may be an effective strategy to combat resistance to targeted therapy in some ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC patients. ",

However, direct evidence of lung carcinogenesis induced by ROS1 fusion genes remains to be verified. The present study shows that EZR-ROS1 plays an essential role in the oncogenesis of NSCLC harboring the fusion gene. EZR-ROS1 was identified in four female patients of lung adenocarcinoma. Three of them were never smokers. Interstitial deletion of 6q22-q25 resulted in gene fusion. Expression of the fusion kinase in NIH3T3 cells induced anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. This transforming ability was attributable to its kinase activity. The ALK/MET/ROS1 kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, suppressed fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells. Most importantly, established transgenic mouse lines specifically expressing EZR-ROS1 in lung alveolar epithelial cells developed multiple adenocarcinoma nodules in both lungs at an early age. These data suggest that the EZR-ROS1 is a pivotal oncogene in human NSCLC, and that this animal model could be valuable for exploring therapeutic agents against ROS1-rearranged lung cancer.",

As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

The relationship between ROS1 or RET rearrangements, clinicopathological features, and prognostic factors were analyzed in resected stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC. Of the 204 cases, 4 cases were confirmed with ROS1 rearrangement, but no RET rearrangement was detected. All 4 ROS1-rearranged cases were adenocarcinomas.

Although the expression of SLC34A2-ROS1, EZR-ROS1, or KIF5B-RET fusion transcripts was not detected in any of the cases, the expression of CD74-ROS1 fusion transcripts was detected in one (0.9%) of the 114 NSCLCs. The fusion occurred between exon 6 of CD74 and exon 34 of ROS1 and was an in-frame alteration. The mutation was detected in a woman without a history of smoking. Histologically, the carcinoma was an adenocarcinoma with a predominant acinar pattern; notably, a mucinous cribriform pattern and a solid signet-ring cell pattern were also observed in part of the adenocarcinoma. ROS1 protein overexpression was immunohistochemically detected in a cancer-specific manner in both the primary cancer and the lymph node metastatic cancer. No somatic mutations were detected in the mutation cluster regions of the KRAS, EGFR, BRAF and PIK3CA genes and the entire coding region of p53 in the carcinoma, and the expression of ALK fusion was negative.

However, many chemoresistant cancer cells often develop a relatively higher threshold for inducing apoptosis, causing a limited efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. Likewise, lung cancer cells acquire chemoresistance against CPT analogs, such as irinotecan and topotecan, finally resulting in an unsatisfied outcome and poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. TFPP is a quinone-containing compound as a candidate for CPT-based combination chemotherapy. In this study, we examined the effect of TFPP and CPT cotreatment on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Cell proliferation and flow cytometry-based Annexin-V/PI staining assays demonstrated the synergistic effect of TFPP on CPT-induced apoptosis in both NSCLC A549 and H1299 cells. The results of CPT and TFPP cotreatment cause the regulation of the ERK-Bim axis and the activation of mitochondrial-mediated caspase cascade, including caspase-9 and caspase-3. Besides, TFPP significantly enhanced CPT-induced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the two NSCLC cells. In contrast, the treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, rescues the apoptosis of NSCLC cells induced by TFPP and CPT cotreatment, suggesting that the synergistic effect of TFPP on CPT-induced anti-NSCLC cells is through upregulating ROS production. Consequently, our results suggest that TFPP sensitizes NSCLC towards CPT-based chemotherapy may act through decreasing the apoptosis-initiating threshold. Therefore, TFPP may be a promising chemosensitizer for lung cancer treatment, and the underlying mechanism warrants further.",

A strategy to target NSCLC is to identify agents that are effective against NSCLC cells while sparing normal cells. We show that tigecycline, an FDA-approved antibiotic drug, preferentially targets NSCLC cells. Tigecycline is effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of multiple cell lines derived from two common NSCLC subtypes: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Tigecycline also dose-dependently inhibits colony formation of NSCLC subpopulation of cells with highly proliferative and invasive properties. Compared to NSCLC cells, tigecycline affects proliferation and survival of normal fibroblast cells significantly to a less extent. More importantly, tigecycline significantly inhibits NSCLC tumor growth through decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. Tigecycline significantly inhibits mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP levels and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that tigecycline impairs mitochondrial functions. Our study suggests that tigecycline may be a useful therapeutic agent, and inhibiting mitochondrial functions may represent a new targeted therapy for NSCLC. ",

We evaluated the effects of the two potential antitumor agents of the lamellarin class on a highly apoptosis-resistant NSCLC cell line. Both the marine alkaloid lamellarin-D and its synthetic amino derivative PM031379 induced the activation of Bax, the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), as well as the activation of caspase-3. However, only PM031379 triggered cell death and sign of nuclear apoptosis coupled to the nuclear translocation of AIF. Depletion of AIF with small interfering RNA or microinjection of a neutralizing anti-AIF antibody largely prevented PM031379-induced cytotoxicity, underscoring the essential contribution of AIF to NSCLC killing. Using NSCLC cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, we showed that the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) was crucial for the PM031379-induced translocation of AIF to the nucleus and subsequently cell death. Pretreatment of NSCLC cells with menadione, a mitochondrial ROS generator, was able to restore the deficient chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Altogether, these data suggest that mitochondrial ROS generation is crucial for overriding the chemoresistance of NSCLC cells. Moreover, this study delineates the unique mechanism of action of lamellarins as potential anticancer agents.",

LY2801653 was more efficacious than the MET/ALK/RON/ROS inhibitor crizotinib with a distinct pattern of downstream signaling effects. Using the PamGene platform, we found that inhibition of MET and RON was associated with decreased phosphorylation of CBL, PI3K, and STAT3. In classic and orthotopic mouse xenograft models of lung cancer, LY2801653 decreased tumor growth, dramatically inhibiting mitotic events and angiogenesis. Taken together, our results argued that specific targeting of the MET/RON kinases could provide robust inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor outgrowth in multiple in vitro and in vivo models of NSCLC.

NSCLC cells were isolated from clinical surgical tissues. We found that LPS stimulation of NSCLC cells facilitates their metastasis that was accompanied by increased ROS production and could be abrogated by ROS inhibition. NADPH oxidase was essential for TLR4 signaling-enhanced NSCLC metastasis. Elevated NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) expression by LPS stimulation was observed. Blockade of NOX1 with ML171 alleviated enhanced NSCLC metastasis by TLR4 signaling. Enforced NOX1 expression promoted TLR4 signaling-enhanced NSCLC metastasis, while decreased NOX1 expression inhibited TLR4 signaling-enhanced NSCLC metastasis. Further, NOX1 could regulate the expression of CXCR4 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) in NSCLC cells. NOX1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with TLR4 expression and clinical stages in NSCLC patients. Finally, inhibition of NOX1/ROS prevented enhanced lung tumor burdens of NSCLC by LPS-induced acute lung infection.

We found that some lung cancer cell lines and tumor samples are characterized by increased levels of lipidated LC3. Inhibition of autophagy sensitized non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis; however, such response was attenuated in cells treated with etoposide. Inhibition of autophagy stimulated ROS formation and treatment with cisplatin had a synergistic effect on ROS accumulation. Using genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide probes directed to intracellular compartments we found that autophagy inhibition facilitated formation of hydrogen peroxide in the cytosol and mitochondria of cisplatin-treated cells. The enhancement of cell death under conditions of inhibited autophagy was partially dependent on caspases, however, antioxidant NAC or hydroxyl radical scavengers, but not the scavengers of superoxide or a MnSOD mimetic, reduced the release of cytochrome c and abolished the sensitization of the cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Such inhibition of ROS prevented the processing and release of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) and HTRA2 from mitochondria. Furthermore, suppression of autophagy in NSCLC cells with active basal autophagy reduced their proliferation without significant effect on the cell-cycle distribution. Inhibition of cell proliferation delayed accumulation of cells in the S phase upon treatment with etoposide that could attenuate the execution stage of etoposide-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that autophagy suppression leads to inhibition of NSCLC cell proliferation and sensitizes them to cisplatin-induced caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis by stimulation of ROS formation.",

We compared the effects of AA and combinations of AA with the glycolysis inhibitor 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3-PO) on the viability of three non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to the effects on an immortalized lung epithelial cell line. AA concentrations of 0.5 to 5 mM caused a complete loss of viability in all NSCLC lines compared to a <10% loss of viability in the lung epithelial cell line. Combinations of AA and 3-PO synergistically enhanced cell death in all NSCLC cell lines at concentrations well below the IC50 concentrations for each compound alone. A synergistic interaction was not observed in combination treatments of lung epithelial cells and combination treatments that caused a complete loss of viability in NSCLC cells had modest effects on normal lung cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Combination treatments induced dramatically higher ROS levels compared to treatment with AA and 3-PO alone in NSCLC cells and combination-induced cell death was inhibited by addition of catalase to the medium. Analyses of DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, annexin V-binding, and caspase activity demonstrated that AA-induced cell death is caused via the activation of apoptosis and that the combination treatments caused a synergistic induction of apoptosis. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AA against NSCLC cells and that combinations of AA with 3-PO synergistically induce apoptosis via a ROS-dependent mechanism. These results support further evaluation of pharmacologic concentrations of AA as an adjuvant treatment for NSCLC and that combination of AA with glycolysis inhibitors may be a promising therapy for the treatment of NSCLC.",

As lung cancers with ROS1 rearrangements comprise only 1-3% of lung adenocarcinomas, patients with such tumors must be identified to gain optimal benefit from molecular therapy. Recently, immunohistochemical analyses using a novel anti-ROS1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (D4D6) have shown promise for accurate identification of ROS1-rearranged cancers. To validate this finding, we compared the immunostaining results of tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 17 ROS1-rearranged and 253 ROS1-non-rearranged lung carcinomas. All 17 ROS1-rearranged cancers showed ROS1 immunoreactivity mostly in a diffuse and moderate-to-strong manner with an H-score range of 5-300 (median, 260). In contrast, 69% of ROS1-non-rearranged cancers lacked detectable immunoreactivity, whereas the remaining 31% showed reactivity mainly in a weak or focal manner. The H-score for the entire ROS1-non-rearranged group ranged from 0 to 240 (median, 0). The difference in H-score between the two cohorts was statistically significant, and the H-score cutoff (≥150) allowed optimal discrimination (94% sensitivity and 98% specificity). Similar but slightly less-specific performance was achieved using the extent of diffuse (≥75%) staining or ≥2+ staining intensity as cutoffs. CD74-ROS1 and EZR-ROS1 fusions were significantly associated with at least focal globular immunoreactivity and plasma membranous accentuation, respectively, and these patterns were specific to ROS1-rearranged cases. Although full-length ROS1 is expressed in some ROS1-non-rearranged cases, we showed that establishment of an optimal set of interpretative criteria makes ROS1 immunohistochemistry a valuable method to rapidly and accurately screen lung cancer patients for appropriate molecular therapy.

ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed (D4D6 clone, Cell Signaling Technology) on all cases as well as fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using the ZytoVision and Abbott Molecular ROS1 FISH probes, with ≥15% of cells with split signals considered positive for rearrangement. Eighty-eight cases (32%) from the retrospective cohort showed staining by ROS1 IHC, and one case (0.4%) showed ROS1 rearrangement by FISH. Nineteen of the prospective diagnostic cases showed ROS1 IHC staining, 12 (12%) cases of which were confirmed as ROS1 rearranged by FISH. There were no ROS1 rearranged cases that showed no expression of ROS1 with IHC. The ROS1 rearranged cases in the prospective cohort were all EGFR wild-type and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement-negative. The sensitivity of ROS1 IHC in the retrospective cohort was 100% and specificity was 76%.;ROS1 rearrangements are rare events in lung adenocarcinomas. Selection of cases for ROS1 FISH testing, by excluding EGFR/ALK-positive cases and use of IHC to screen for potentially positive cases, can be used to enrich for the likelihood of identifying a ROS1 rearranged lung cancer and prevent the need to undertake expensive and time-consuming FISH testing in all cases.",

The effects of c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor (c-Met/HGF, ligand for c-Met) on activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined. HGF stimulation of c-Met-overexpressing H69 SCLC cells (40 ng/ml, 15 min) resulted in an increase of ROS, measured with fluorescent probe 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) or dihydroethidine (DHE) but not in c-Met-null H446 cells. ROS was increased in juxtamembrane (JM)-mutated variants (R988C and T1010I) of c-Met compared with wild-type c-Met-expressing cells. ROS was significantly inhibited by preincubation of SCLC cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 100 microM) and/or SU11274 (small molecule c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 2 microM) for 3 h. PDTC and SU11274 also abrogated the HGF proliferative signal and cell motility in a cooperative fashion. H(2)O(2) treatment of SCLC cells (over 15 min) led to phosphorylation of c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase and further upregulated downstream phosphorylation of phospho-AKT, ERK1/2, and paxillin in a dose-dependent manner (125 microM to 500 microM). c-Met is an important target in lung cancer, and the pathways responsible for ROS generation together may provide novel therapeutic intervention.",

Crizotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which silences the protein product of the ALK fusion gene and has recently been approved for the treatment of NSCLC aberrantly expressing ALK. Emerging data suggest that crizotinib may also have activity in other subsets of lung cancer, including tumors demonstrating amplification or mutation of the MET oncogene, or translocation of the ROS1 oncogene.;This paper gives an overview of the molecular pathogenesis of ALK-associated NSCLC.

Analysis yielded 20 novel genes differentially expressed in both lung adenomas and ACs versus normal lungs, including the tumor suppressor APC2 and the oncogene Ros 1. In addition, 50 genes were found to be differentially expressed in lung adenomas versus lung ACs, including the differentiation factor Hox C6, the oncogene Ets 2, and the Ras nuclear transport factor, nuclear transport factor 2. To understand the potential relationship between genes expressed in murine lung tumors and its relationship to altered gene expression observed during embryogenesis and postnatal development, tissues from embryonic lungs and from lungs of mice up to 4 weeks following birth were examined using Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips. From this analysis, approximately 1300 genes were determined to exhibit differential expression in fetal lung versus postnatal lung. When we compared lung adenomas, lung ACs, and normal lung parenchyma, 24 developmentally regulated genes were found aberrantly expressed in lung tumors; these included the cell cycle control factor CDC5, the cellular differentiation factor TEA domain 4, and the proapoptotic factor BNIP 2. Finally, we compared the murine lung tumor gene expression data to the expression of genes in human lung cancer, in order to assess the relevance of murine lung cancer models in the study of human AC formation. When the 17 human lung ACs and six human lung large cell carcinomas were examined, it was found that 13 of the 17 human lung ACs clustered tightly together in a pattern that was different from the remaining four human lung ACs and six large cell carcinomas, which exhibited a different pattern. Interestingly, the mouse lung adenomas appeared similar to 13 clustered ACs, while mouse lung ACs appeared more similar in pattern to the group consisting of four ACs and six large-cell carcinomas (LCCs). Nevertheless, when compared with the combined human ACs, 39 genes with similar expression changes in murine lung tumors and human ACs/LCCs were identified, such as the oncogene-related BCL7B, the cell cycle regulator CDK4, and the proapoptotic Endophilin B1. Overall, we have determined, for the first time, the expression profiles during murine lung tumor progression and have established, at the molecular level, an association between murine lung tumorigenesis and lung development.

However, radioresistance is a major obstacle to the success of radiation therapy and contributes significantly to tumor recurrence and treatment failure, highlighting the need for the development of novel radiosensitizers that can be used to overcome tumor radioresistance and, thus, improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous studies indicated that resveratrol (RV) may sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (IR). However, the mechanisms by which RV increases the radiation sensitivity of cancer cells have not been well characterized. Here, we show that RV treatment enhances IR-induced cell killing in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through an apoptosis-independent mechanism. Further studies revealed that the percentage of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive senescent cells was markedly higher in cells treated with IR in combination with RV compared with cells treated either with IR or RV alone, suggesting that RV treatment enhances IR-induced premature senescence in lung cancer cells. Comet assays demonstrate that RV and IR combined treatment causes more DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) than IR or RV treatment alone. DCF-DA staining and flow cytometric analyses demonstrate that RV and IR combined treatment leads to a significant increase in ROS production in irradiated NSCLC cells. Furthermore, our investigation show that inhibition of ROS production by N-acetyl-cysteine attenuates RV-induced radiosensitization in lung cancer cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that RV-induced radiosensitization is associated with significant increase of ROS production, DNA-DSBs and senescence induction in irradiated NSCLC cells, suggesting that RV treatment may sensitize lung cancer cells to radiotherapy via enhancing IR-induced premature senescence.",

Next-generation sequencing has been widely applied to the discovery of more genetic profiles of lung cancers.

Here, we synthesized phospho-ibuprofen amide (PIA), a metabolically stable analog of phospho-ibuprofen, formulated it in nanocarriers, and evaluated its pharmacokinetics and anticancer efficacy in pre-clinical models of human lung cancer. PIA was 10-fold more potent than ibuprofen in suppressing the growth of human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, an effect mediated by favorably altering cytokinetics and inducing oxidative stress. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats revealed that liposome-encapsulated PIA exhibited remarkable resistance to hydrolysis by carboxylesterases, remaining largely intact in the systemic circulation, and demonstrated selective distribution to the lungs. The antitumor activity of liposomal PIA was evaluated in a metastatic model of human NSCLC in mice. Liposomal PIA strongly inhibited lung tumorigenesis (>95%) and was significantly (p<0.05) more efficacious than ibuprofen. We observed a significant induction of urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2αin vivo, which indicates that ROS stress probably plays an important role in mediating the antitumor efficacy of PIA.

The c-ros-1 gene was found to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and the sizes of its transcripts were heterogeneous: 8.2 kilobases (kb) long in lung and kidney tissues, 6.9 kb in heart tissue, and 2.4 kb and 1.9 kb in testis tissue. The c-ros-1 cDNAs were isolated from lung and heart tissues. The predicted product of the c-ros-1 gene in lung tissue was a receptor-type tyrosine kinase 2,317 amino acids long (including a very large extracellular domain of approximately 1,800 amino acids) which showed a partial but significant structural homology with the sev gene product of Drosophila melanogaster. An alternatively sliced lung transcript was found to encode a protein with external and transmembrane domains but not a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. The predicted product in heart tissue was essentially identical to that in lung tissue except for a shorter amino-terminal region and a 21-amino-acid insertion in the extracellular domain. On the basis of these results, the c-ros-1 gene appears to be active in the lungs and kidneys and probably in the hearts of rats.",

We are presenting a case of adenocarcinoma of lung, who progressed on first-line chemotherapy and received crizotinib as second line therapy for 9 months. Patient has very good partial response to crizotinib and had some side effects of crizotinib like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia and anorexia, asymptomatic transaminitis in the first 2 to 3 weeks of therapy and managed symptomatically. But after 9 months, he developed sudden onset left sided vision loss. On fundoscopic examination he was found to have \"cherry red spot\" and fundus flourescein angiography revealed central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). After 15 days of vision loss patient developed pleural effusion, and pleural fluid cytology was positive for malignant cells. Visual symptoms are very well known in the literature as side effects of crizotinib, but CRAO is not yet been documented. As this patient is not having any prothrombotic state like diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, hyperhomocysteinemia or any genetic disorders except malignancy. Hypercoagulability disorders are known to be commonly associated with a variety of cancer types including lung cancer. This appears to be a sign of early crizotinib resistance in this patient because there was no history of prior hypercoagulable state.

However, radiation as a lung cancer treatment remains far from satisfactory due to problems associated with radiation resistance in cancer cells and severe cytotoxicity to non-cancer cells, which arise at doses typically administered to patients. We have recently identified a promising novel inhibitor of β-catenin/Tcf4 interaction, named BC-23 (C21H14ClN3O4S), which acts as a potent cell death enhancer when used in combination with radiation. Sequential exposure of human p53-null non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H1299 cells to low doses of x-ray radiation, followed 1 hour later by administration of minimally cytotoxic concentrations of BC-23, resulted in a highly synergistic induction of clonogenic cell death (combination index <1.0). Co-treatment with BC-23 at low concentrations effectively inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and down-regulates c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression. S phase arrest and ROS generation are also involved in the enhancement of radiation effectiveness mediated by BC-23. BC-23 therefore represents a promising new class of radiation enhancer. ",

Erlotinib, a small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) inhibitor, has been approved for the management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether erlotinib exerts potent antitumour activities through the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549. 2. The 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Hoechst 33342 staining showed that erlotinib produced a decline in cell viability of A549 cells and induced cell apoptosis, coupled with quick accumulation of ROS. In addition, erlotinib increased the respiratory control ratio, NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit gp91(phox) expression and superoxide anion (O2(-)) generation, suggesting that erlotinib induced ROS production in A549 cells from both mitochondrial and NADPH oxidase sources. 3. Fluorescence microscopy with the JC-1 probe and western blot analysis indicated that erlotinib induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and activation of JNK. 4. The results of the present study suggest that erlotinib has potent antitumour activity in A549 cells by activating ROS-dependent, JNK-driven cell apoptosis.

Concentrates of each fraction were loaded onto lanes of minigels of an automated electrophoresis system. Analysis of the chromatograms reveals peaks seen only in CM of the classic SCLC lines. Electrophoretic analysis of the fractions containing these peaks reveal protein bands distinguishing between the subtypes of human SCLC. One protein was purified to homogeneity with subsequent reversed-phase chromatography and identified by protein microsequencing as histone H2B.

Assays were performed for lactate production; hexokinase activity and intracellular ROS; and immunoblotting for hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, and glucose transporter type 1 (Glut-1). Animal studies were performed with small-animal PET imaging of Lewis lung carcinoma tumor-bearing mice.;Resveratrol mildly decreased cell content and more pronouncedly suppressed (18)F-FDG uptake in Lewis lung carcinoma, HT-29 colon, and T47D breast cancer cells. Hence, (18)F-FDG uptake normalized to cell content was reduced to less than half of controls by 24-h exposure to resveratrol. This reduction was attributed to reduced glycolytic flux and Glut-1 expression. Resveratrol also decreased intracellular ROS in patterns that closely paralleled (18)F-FDG uptake. Scavenging of ROS with N-acetyl cysteine, but not inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, was sufficient to suppress (18)F-FDG uptake. Conversely, ROS inducers effectively reversed the metabolic response of resveratrol. HIF-1α protein was markedly reduced by resveratrol, and inhibiting HIF-1α expression with cycloheximide or specific small interfering RNAs suppressed (18)F-FDG uptake. The proteosomal inhibitor MG132 partly restored HIF-1α level and (18)F-FDG uptake in resveratrol-treated cells. Resveratrol also inhibited Akt activation; in addition, inhibitors and small interfering RNAs against phosphoinositide 3-kinase decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Finally, small-animal PET results showed resveratrol treatment to suppress tumor (18)F-FDG uptake in vivo.;Resveratrol suppresses cancer cell (18)F-FDG uptake and glycolytic metabolism in a manner that depends on the capacity of resveratrol to inhibit intracellular ROS, which downregulates HIF-1α accumulation.",

Rh123 staining assay indicated that GPX reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. DCFH-DA staining revealed that intracellular ROS increased with GPX treatment. Moreover, GPX cleaved and activated caspase-3. In summary, this study showed that GPX inhibited H520 cell proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manner. Further mechanistic study indicated that GPX induced cell apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptotic pathway accompanying with ROS production. Our results demonstrate the potential application of GPX as an anti-non-small cell lung cancer agent. ",

The relative mtDNA copy number and the oxidative mtDNA damage (formation of 8-OHdG in mtDNA) of each cancer tissue were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Seven female and 22 male lung cancer patients, with a mean age of 63.5 years were evaluated. Tumors of five patients became progressive, 13 stable, and 11 partially responsive after preoperative chemotherapy. Low mtDNA copy number (P=0.089) and low degree of oxidative mtDNA damage (P=0.036) were found to associate with tumor progression. Moreover, mtDNA copy number was significantly related to the degree of oxidative mtDNA damage (P=0.031). The mtDNA copy number and oxidative mtDNA damage were lower in advanced NSCLC after chemotherapy. This finding suggests that a decrease in the content of mtDNA may result in a decrease of mitochondrial density in cancer cells, which leads to a decrease of endogenous ROS production and reduction of ROS-triggered DNA damage to achieve immortalization.",

The assay incorporates detection of wild-type exon junctions immediately upstream and downstream of the fusion junction to exclude false-negative results. To flag false-positives, the system also comprises two independent assays for each fusion gene junction.;The characteristic mass spectrometric peaks of the gene fusions were obtained using engineered plasmid constructs. Specific assays targeting the wild-type gene exon junctions were validated using complimentary DNA from lung tissue of healthy individuals. The system was further validated using complimentary DNA derived from NSCLC cell lines that express endogenous fusion genes. The expressed ROS1-SLC34A2 and CCDC6-RET gene fusions from the NSCLC cell lines HCC78 and LC-2/ad, respectively, were accurately detected by the novel assay. The assay is extremely sensitive, capable of detecting an event in test specimens containing 0.5% positive tumors.;The novel multiplexed assay is robustly capable of detecting 15 different clinically relevant RET and ROS1 fusion variants.

To characterize the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK dependence of lung cancers harboring BRAF kinase domain mutations, we screened a large panel of human lung cancer cell lines (n = 87) and tumors (n = 916) for BRAF mutations. We found that non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cells with both V600E and non-V600E BRAF mutations were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with those harboring mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, or ALK and ROS kinase fusions. Supporting its classification as a \"driver\" mutation in the cells in which it is expressed, MEK inhibition in (V600E)BRAF NSCLC cells led to substantial induction of apoptosis, comparable with that seen with EGFR kinase inhibition in EGFR mutant NSCLC models. Despite high basal ERK phosphorylation, EGFR mutant cells were uniformly resistant to MEK inhibition. Conversely, BRAF mutant cell lines were resistant to EGFR inhibition. These data, together with the nonoverlapping pattern of EGFR and BRAF mutations in human lung cancer, suggest that these lesions define distinct clinical entities whose treatment should be guided by prospective real-time genotyping. To facilitate such an effort, we developed a mass spectrometry-based genotyping method for the detection of hotspot mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR. Using this assay, we confirmed that BRAF mutations can be identified in a minority of NSCLC tumors and that patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations have a distinct clinical profile compared with those whose tumors harbor kinase domain mutations in EGFR.",

However, relationship between host Nrf2 and cancer metastasis remains unexplored. To address this issue, we examined susceptibility of Nrf2-deficient mice to pulmonary cancer metastasis following implantation of the mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) cell line. Nrf2-deficient mice reproducibly exhibited a higher number of pulmonary metastatic nodules than wild-type mice did. The lung and bone marrow (BM) of cancer-bearing Nrf2-deficient mice contained increased numbers of inflammatory cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a potent population of immunosuppressive cells. MDSCs can attenuate CD8(+) T-cell immunity through modification of the T-cell receptor complex exploiting reactive oxygen species (ROS). MDSCs of Nrf2-deficient mice retained elevated levels of ROS relative to wild-type mice. BM transplantation experiments revealed functional disturbance in the hematopoietic and immune systems of Nrf2-deficient mice. Wild-type recipient mice with Nrf2-deficient BM cells showed increased levels of lung metastasis after cancer cell inoculation. These mice exhibited high-level accumulation of ROS in MDSCs, which showed very good coincidence to the decrease of splenic CD8(+) T-cells. In contrast, Keap1-knockdown mutant mice harboring high-level Nrf2 expression displayed increased resistance against the cancer cell metastasis to the lung, accompanied by a decrease in ROS in the MDSCs fraction. Our results thus reveal a novel function for Nrf2 in the prevention of cancer metastasis, presumably by its ability to preserve the redox balance in the hematopoietic and immune systems.",

In recent decades only histomorphology was used to classify lung cancer as either small (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although NSCLC was further subdivided in different entities; however, as no specific therapy options were available classification of specific subtypes was not clinically meaningful. This fundamentally changed with the discovery of specific molecular alterations in adenocarcinoma (ADC), e.g. mutations in KRAS, EGFR and BRAF or translocations of the ALK and ROS1 gene loci, which now form the basis of targeted therapies and have led to a significantly improved patient outcome. The diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of imaging, morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics as well as their interaction were systematically assessed in a large cohort with available clinical data including patient survival. Specific and sensitive diagnostic markers and marker panels were defined and diagnostic test algorithms for predictive biomarker assessment were optimized. It was demonstrated that the semi-quantitative assessment of ADC growth patterns is a stage-independent predictor of survival and is reproducibly applicable in the routine setting. Specific histomorphological characteristics correlated with computed tomography (CT) imaging features and thus allowed an improved interdisciplinary classification, especially in the preoperative or palliative setting. Moreover, specific molecular characteristics, for example BRAF mutations and the proliferation index (Ki-67) were identified as clinically relevant prognosticators. Comprehensive clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular assessment of NSCLCs allow an optimized patient stratification. Respective algorithms now form the backbone of the 2015 lung cancer World Health Organization (WHO) classification. ",

Accumulating evidence indicates that inhibition of LDH-A induces apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress in cancer cells. To date, it's still unclear that whether autophagy can be induced by LDH-A inhibition. Here, we investigated the effects of oxamate, one classic inhibitor of LDH-A in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as well as normal lung epithelial cells. The results showed that oxamate significantly suppressed the proliferation of NSCLC cells, while it exerted a much lower toxicity in normal cells. As previous studies reported, LDH-A inhibition resulted in ATP reduction and ROS (reactive oxygen species) burst in cancer cells, which lead to apoptosis and G2/M arrest in H1395 cells. However, when being exposed to oxamate, A549 cells underwent autophagy as a protective mechanism against apoptosis. Furthermore, we found evidence that LDH-A inhibition induced G0/G1 arrest dependent on the activation of GSK-3β in A549 cells. Taken together, our results provide useful clues for targeting LDH-A in NSCLC treatment and shed light on the discovery of molecular predictors for the sensitivity of LDH-A inhibitors. ",

Here, we show that O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (JS-K) is a potent cytotoxic agent against a subset of human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines both in vitro and as xenografts in mice. JS-K treatment led to 75% reduction in the growth of H1703 lung adenocarcinoma cells in vivo. Differences in sensitivity to JS-K in different lung cancer cell lines seem to be related to their endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Other related factors, levels of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRX1) and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine glycosylase (OGG1), also correlated with drug sensitivity. Treatment of the lung adenocarcinoma cells with JS-K resulted in oxidative/nitrosative stress in cells with high basal levels of ROS/RNS, which, combined with the arylating properties of the compound, was reflected in glutathione depletion and alteration in cellular redox potential, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, and cytochrome c release. Inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase by nitration was associated with increased superoxide and significant DNA damage. Apoptosis followed these events. Taken together, the data suggest that diazeniumdiolate-based NO-releasing prodrugs may have application as a personalized therapy for lung cancers characterized by high levels of ROS/RNS.

This study was done to investigate the anticancer effects of zerumbone on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and explored the involvement of p53 signaling. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay. Apoptosis was confirmed by annexin-V/propidium iodide staining and caspase activity assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δφm) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by flow cytometry. Depletion of p53 was achieved by transfection of specific small interfering RNA. Gene expression changes were determined by Western blot analysis. Zerumbone treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of A549 and H460 NSCLC cell viability. Zerumbone-induced mitochondrial apoptosis of NSCLC cells, evidenced loss of Δφm, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 and -3. There was increased p53 and Bax expression and ROS production in zerumbone-treated cells. Downregulation of p53 or scavenging ROS interfered with the pro-apoptotic action of zerumbone. Combinational treatment with zerumbone and cisplatin significantly accelerated apoptosis and promoted p53 expression and ROS production in NSCLC cells, compared with each alone. These findings demonstrate that zerumbone induces mitochondrial apoptosis and enhances the susceptibility to cisplatin in NSCLC cells, which are, at least partially, mediated through activation of p53 signaling and promotion of ROS generation. This study may provide a rationale for the potential clinical application of zerumbone as a chemotherapeutic agent against NSCLC. ",

Subsequent studies revealed that activity of AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) were downregulated during autophagy. Furthermore, SPC failed to promote autophagy in p53 deleted cells. Thus SPC induced autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer cells was through AKT/mTORC1 and P53 signal pathway. Besides, SPC reduced both the mitochondria membrane potential and ROS level in A549 cells.

In lung cancer, screening immunohistochemical staining for ALK and ROS1 has been validated as highly sensitive for these translocations, but this has not been investigated in CRC. We therefore sought to investigate the incidence of ALK and ROS1 overexpression as detected by immunohistochemical staining in a large cohort of CRCs. Of the 1889 CRCs, only 1 case (0.05%) demonstrated diffuse strong positive staining for ALK, whereas 14 (0.7%) showed weak nonspecific staining; the remainder were negative. The 1 positive case was confirmed to harbor an ALK rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), whereas the 14 tumors with weak staining were FISH-negative. The ALK positive case demonstrated positive expression in all dysplastic and malignant cells indicating that the translocation was an early clonal event. No cases were positive for ROS1 by immunohistochemical staining, although 2 cases did show some nonspecific staining and were shown to be negative for ROS1 translocation by FISH. We conclude that although diffuse strong positive staining for ALK is likely to be highly specific for ALK rearrangement in CRC, both ALK and ROS1 immunohistochemical staining are very low-yield tests and difficult to justify in the routine clinical setting.

However, the function and the underlying mechanisms of icaritin in human non-small cell lung cancer have not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anticancer effects of icaritin on A549 cells and explore the underlying molecular mechanism. The cell viability after icaritin treatment was tested by MTT assay. The cell cycle distribution, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of the genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis were respectively detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The results demonstrated that icaritin induced cell cycle arrest at S phase, and down-regulated the expression levels of S regulatory proteins such as Cyclin A and CDK2. Icaritin also induced cell apoptosis characterized by positive Hoechst 33258 staining, accumulation of the Annexin V-positive cells, increased ROS level and alteration in Bcl-2 family proteins expression. Moreover, icaritin induced sustained phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK. These findings suggested that icaritin might be a new potent inhibitor by inducing S phase arrest and apoptosis in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. ",

Yet, the long-term survival rate of this cancer has not improved since multi-drug resistance (MDR) may emerge after chemotherapy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation-related biological processes, such as energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, have been considered to be associated with tumorigenesis and drug resistance. It was hypothesized and demonstrated, in the present study, that mitochondrial dysfunction is the reason for the occurrence and progression of SCLC. mtDNA from drug sensitive and drug insensitive cell lines (H446 and H446/CDDP) was sequenced and compared with the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS). The results revealed that there was no difference in the mtDNA sequence from H446 and H446/CDDP cells, but several spot mutations were observed according to that of rCRs. Further evaluation on mitochondrial function revealed that H446 cells synthesized and secreted more lactic acid and ROS compared with that of H446/CDDP cells when challenged by the same dose of cisplatin (P>0.05). In addition, examination of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indicated that more Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were expressed in H446 cells compared with that of H446/CDDP cells when stimulated by the same dose of cisplatin (P>0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that mtDNA mutations were responsible for the tumorigenesis of SLCL, but not associated with the drug sensitivity of SCLC cell lines. On the other hand, varied mitochondrium content‑related mitochondrial dysfunction participated in the MDR of SCLC possibly by affecting the ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.",

Herein, we have studied the expression, biological relevance, mechanism of regulation and potential clinical impact of IF1 in some prevalent human carcinomas. We show that IF1 is highly overexpressed in most (>90%) of the colon (n=64), lung (n=30), breast (n=129) and ovarian (n=10) carcinomas studied as assessed by different approaches in independent cohorts of cancer patients. The expression of IF1 in the corresponding normal tissues is negligible. By contrast, the endometrium, stomach and kidney show high expression of IF1 in the normal tissue revealing subtle differences by carcinogenesis. The overexpression of IF1 also promotes the activation of aerobic glycolysis and a concurrent ROS signal in mitochondria of the lung, breast and ovarian cancer cells mimicking the activity of oligomycin. IF1-mediated ROS signaling activates cell-type specific adaptive responses aimed at preventing death in these cell lines. Remarkably, regulation of IF1 expression in the colon, lung, breast and ovarian carcinomas is exerted at post-transcriptional levels. We demonstrate that IF1 is a short-lived protein (t1/2 ∼100 min) strongly implicating translation and/or protein stabilization as main drivers of metabolic reprogramming and cell survival in these human cancers. Analysis of tumor expression of IF1 in cohorts of breast and colon cancer patients revealed its relevance as a predictive marker for clinical outcome, emphasizing the high potential of IF1 as therapeutic target.",

Apoptosis was detected by annexin V/propidium iodide double-labeled flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry.

In this study, we aim to investigate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TKI resistance as well as the molecular and biological effects of EGFR(T790M) after redox manipulation.;The basal ROS levels in EGFR(T790M)-containing TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines were substantially high. Sixty-three human lung tumors showed higher NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (NOX2) expression than normal lung tissues, which may contribute to high basal ROS in cancer and poor survival. Interestingly, only NOX3 was upregulated by sanguinarine, a pharmacological agent to elevate ROS, and resulted in EGFR overoxidation, degradation, and apoptosis. By contrast, such responses were lacking in EGFR(WT) cells. Selective EGFR(T790M) degradation was manipulated by redox imbalance between NOX3 and methionine reductase A (MsrA). Furthermore, the in vivo tumor suppression effect of sanguinarine, NOX3 upregulation, and EGFR degradation were confirmed.;We have found a new treatment strategy to overcome TKI resistance by selectively inducing EGFR(T790M) degradation via specific stimulation of methionine 790 (M790) oxidation.

In this study, we propose that combination therapy of 2-dDG with Met will demonstrate enhanced cytotoxicity than either compound alone. Our results indicated that inhibition concentration 25 (IC25) for combined treatment of Met and 2-dDG showed more toxicity as compared to individual agents on a NSCLC cell line, A549. This augmented toxicity is associated with increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione level as well as decreased super oxide dismutase and catalase activities. Combination of Met and 2-dDG also demonstrated enhanced DNA damage, DNA adduct formation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and mitochondrial membrane potential alteration, as well as increased apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, P-p38 and P-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) level. It was also shown that inhibition of caspase-3 and p38 kinase partially (75%-87%) reversed Met and 2-dDG induced cell death, without affecting the ROS levels.

About 32% (16 of 50) of these cell lines were highly susceptible to this compound, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of < 1 μM. In mechanistic studies, the increased numbers of apoptotic cells as well as increased PARP cleavage showed that cytotoxic effects correlate with apoptosis induction.

However, recent evidence has shown that irradiation can promote the invasion and metastasis of several types of cancer, and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism by which radiation enhances the invasiveness of NSCLC cells. We found that after irradiation, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) was increased and translocated into the nucleus, where it bound to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the CXCR4 promoter and promoted the transcription of CXCR4. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) also plays a role in the radiation-induced expression of CXCR4. Our results revealed that 2 Gy X-ray irradiation promoted the metastasis and invasiveness of H1299, A549 and H460 cells, which were significantly enhanced by SDF-1α treatment. Blocking the SDF-1α/CXCR4 interaction could suppress the radiation-induced invasiveness of NSCLC cells. The PI3K/pAkt and MAPK/pERK1/2 pathways were found to be involved in radiation-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. In vivo, irradiation promoted the colonization of H1299 cells in the liver and lung, which was mediated by CXCR4.

We show elevated NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) levels in tumors from NSCLC patients. beta-Lapachone, an effective chemotherapeutic and radiosensitizing agent, selectively killed NSCLC cells that expressed high levels of NQO1. Isogenic H596 NSCLC cells that lacked or expressed NQO1 along with A549 NSCLC cells treated with or without dicoumarol, were used to elucidate the mechanism of action and optimal therapeutic window of beta-lapachone. NSCLC cells were killed in an NQO1-dependent manner by beta-lapachone (LD50, approximately 4 microM) with a minimum 2-h exposure. Kinetically, beta-lapachone-induced cell death was characterized by the following: (i) dramatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, eliciting extensive DNA damage; (ii) hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1); (iii) depletion of NAD+/ATP levels; and (iv) proteolytic cleavage of p53/PARP-1, indicating mu-calpain activation and apoptosis. Beta-lapachone-induced PARP-1 hyperactivation, nucleotide depletion, and apoptosis were blocked by 3-aminobenzamide, a PARP-1 inhibitor, and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), a Ca2+ chelator.

However, whether the crosstalk of NOX4 and IL-6 signalings exists in NSCLC remains undentified. In this study, we show that NOX4 expression is positively correlated with IL-6 expression in NSCLC tissues. Exogenous IL-6 treatment significantly enhances NOX4/ROS/Akt signaling in NSCLC cells. NOX4 also enhances IL-6 production and activates IL-6/STAT3 signaling in NSCLC cells. Specifically, NOX4 is confirmed to functionally interplay with IL-6 to promote NSCLC cell proliferation and survival. The in vivo results were similar to those obtained in vitro. These data indicate a novel NOX4-dependent link among IL-6 in the NSCLC microenvironment, oxidative stress in NSCLC cells and autocrined IL-6 in NSCLC cells. NOX4/Akt and IL-6/STAT3 signalings can reciprocally and positively regulate each other, leading to enhanced NSCLC cell proliferation and survival. Therefore, NOX4 may serve as a promising target against NSCLC alone with IL-6 signaling. ",

However, no effective strategies against VEGF expression have been available in NSCLCs therapy. This study demonstrated that elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels derived from both mitochondria and NADPH oxidase were required for VEGF expression in NSCLC cells. Atorvastatin administration could significantly inhibit VEGF expression both in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of ROS production. Atorvastatin inhibited ROS generation partly through suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity. Specifically, atorvastatin could upregulate the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase, which are responsible for elimination of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. Thus, inhibition of ROS production by concomitant suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity and upregulation of the activity of GPx and catalase contributes critically to atorvastatin-reduced VEGF expression in NSCLCs. Atorvastatin may be a potential alternative against VEGF expression and angiogenesis in NSCLCs therapy.",

Here we determined that TLR4 activation with LPS promoted outgrowth of primary human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LPS stimulation increased expression levels of microRNA-21 (miR-21) in primary human lung cancer cells. Inhibition of miR-21 blocked the enhanced lung cancer growth induced by LPS in vitro and in vivo. Up-regulation of miR-21 promoted outgrowth of primary human lung cancer. Down-regulation of miR-21 limited primary human lung cancer outgrowth. Further, TLR4 activation in primary human lung cancer cells increased their ROS levels. Scavenge of ROS abrogated the up-regulation of miR-21 in primary human lung cancer cells and attenuated LPS-induced outgrowth. For in vivo relevance, expression of TLR4 was correlated with miR-21 expression and ROS production in freshly isolated, untreated primary human lung cancer cells. These findings demonstrate an essential role of TLR4/ROS/miR-21 pathway in LPS-induced outgrowth of primary human lung cancer.

The phylogenetic proximity of the ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) catalytic domains led to the clinical repurposing of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK inhibitor crizotinib as a ROS1 inhibitor. Despite the antitumor activity of crizotinib observed in both ROS1- and ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, resistance due to acquisition of ROS1 or ALK kinase domain mutations has been observed clinically, spurring the development of second-generation inhibitors. Here, we profile the sensitivity and selectivity of seven ROS1 and/or ALK inhibitors at various levels of clinical development. In contrast to crizotinib's dual ROS1/ALK activity, cabozantinib (XL-184) and its structural analog foretinib (XL-880) demonstrate a striking selectivity for ROS1 over ALK. Molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal structural features that distinguish the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains and contribute to differences in binding site and kinase selectivity of the inhibitors tested. Cell-based resistance profiling studies demonstrate that the ROS1-selective inhibitors retain efficacy against the recently reported CD74-ROS1(G2032R) mutant whereas the dual ROS1/ALK inhibitors are ineffective. Taken together, inhibitor profiling and stringent characterization of the structure-function differences between the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains will facilitate future rational drug design for ROS1- and ALK-driven NSCLC and other malignancies.

However, the effects of simvastatin on pemetrexed-induced apoptosis have not been investigated. In this study, we investigated whether combination treatment with pemetrexed and simvastatin potentiates the apoptotic activity above that is seen with either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC cells. We found that the combination of pemetrexed and simvastatin induced more extensive caspase-dependent apoptosis than either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma cells (MSTO-211) or NSCLC cells (A549). In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cells treated with both pemetrexed and simvastatin was markedly increased compared to cells treated with either pemetrexed or simvastatin alone. Combination treatment also increased the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and altered expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) families of apoptosis related proteins. On the other hand, pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction by pemetrexed and simvastatin. In addition, Bim siRNA conferred protection against apoptosis induced by pemetrexed and simvastatin. These results suggest that combination of pemetrexed and simvastatin potentiates their apoptotic activity beyond that of either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer cells.

However, when treated with a chalcone compound [toluenesulfonylamido-chalcone, 4'-(p-toluene sulfonyl amino)-3,4-dihydroxy chalcone (TSHDC)], cell death was dramatically induced in NCI-H1299 cells as compared to NCI-H460 cells. TSHDC-mediated cytotoxicity was not dependent on the status of p53 and p21. However, TSHDC exerted increased c-Myc-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in NCI-H1299 cells in which c-Myc is overexpressed, while increased ROS production did not occur in A549 or NCI-H460 cells with a low c-Myc level.

The results showed that Fra-1 was overexpressed in the lung cancer tissues when compared with the level in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. To explore the possible mechanism of Fra-1 in lung cancer, we elucidated the effect of Fra-1 on the apoptosis of lung cancer H460 cells, and found that the rate of cell apoptosis was decreased in the H460/Fra-1 cells compared with the H460 or H460/vector cells. Cell apoptosis is closely related with a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations. Our results showed that overexpression of Fra-1 in the lung cancer H460 cells, led to an increase in ΔΨm and and a decrease in intracellular ROS and Ca2+ concentrations. Furthermore, we found that Fra-1 was correlated with dysregulation of the P53 signaling pathway in lung cancer tissues in vitro.

Cell viability was determined using MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays, and an inverted phase contrast microscope was used to examine the morphological changes in these cells. Cedrol‑triggered autophagy was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the cells, as well as by western blot analysis of microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3)B expression. Intracellular ROS generation was measured by flow cytometry using 5-(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-DCFH2-DA) staining and MTP was measured using flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that cedrol reduced cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic evaluations indicated that cedrol induced apoptosis by reducing the MTP and by decreasing the levels of phosphorylated (p-)PI3K and p-Akt. Cedrol induced autophagy, which was confirmed by TEM analysis, by increasing intracellular ROS formation in a concentration-dependent manner, which was almost completely reversed by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and tocopherol. Taken together, these findings reveal that cedrol inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in A549 cells through mitochondrial and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Our findings also reveal that cedrol induced pro-death autophagy by increasing intracellular ROS production. ",

In cancer cells, ROS induce cell proliferation, genetic instability, and a malignant phenotype. Ginsenoside Rg3 is the main pharmacologically active component in ginseng and has been reported to have an antioxidant effect. To overcome lung cancer by regulating the ROS level, we investigated the antitumor effect and mechanism of Rg3 and its antioxidative property on Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells.;Inhibition of ROS was suppressed in LLC cells by Rg3 treatment, and these cells were used to investigate the antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antitumor effects in LLC cells.;ROS production was increased in cells grown in serum-containing media (conditioned media) compared to those grown in serum-free media. The high level of ROS induced LLC cell proliferation, but treatment with Rg3 (200 ng/ml) resulted in reduction of ROS, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation. Treatment with Rg3 significantly reduced cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase expression in LLC cells. Additionally, Rg3 treatment significantly suppressed activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and induced LLC cell apoptosis through activation of pro-apoptotic proteins and suppression of anti-apoptotic proteins.;Taken together, these findings demonstrate the role of Rg3 in reduction of the intracellular ROS level, attenuation of proliferation via augmentation of cell cycle- and cell proliferation-associated proteins, and activation of apoptosis through regulation of apoptosis-associated proteins in LLC. These findings suggest that Rg3 could be used as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer.",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) are important in cancer progression and regulation of EMT. To explore the biological significance and regulatory mechanism of EMT, we determined the expression, the biological function and the signaling pathway of prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced-1 (TMEPAI), during the induction of EMT and cell migration. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 significantly upregulated the expression of TMEPAI during EMT in human lung adenocarcinoma. Depletion of TMEPAI abolished TGF-β1-induced downregulation of ferritin heavy chain and the subsequent generation of ROS, thus suppressing TGF-β1-induced EMT and cell migration. In addition, increased ROS production and overexpression of TMEPAI downregulated the level of IRS-1. Both the addition of H2O2 and IRS-1 small interfering RNA rescued the ability of TGF-β1 to induce EMT in TMEPAI-depleted cells. Remarkably, the levels of TMEPAI in lung tumor tissues are very high, whereas its expression in normal lung epithelium is very low. Moreover, TMEPAI expression was positively correlated with the cell mesenchymal phenotype and migration potential. Our work reveals that TMEPAI contributes to TGF-β1-induced EMT through ROS production and IRS-1 downregulation in lung cancer cells. ",

Constitutive activation of Nrf2 in lung cancer cells promotes tumorigenicity and contributes to chemoresistance by upregulation of glutathione, thioredoxin, and the drug efflux pathways involved in detoxification of electrophiles and broad spectrum of drugs. In this study, we show that RNAi-mediated lowering of Nrf2 levels in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549 and H460) led to a dramatic increase in endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Similarly, γ-irradiation-induced formation of protein carbonyls were significantly higher in Nrf2-depleted lung cancer cells, suggesting increased lethality of ionizing radiation in the absence of Nrf2. Radiation-induced protein oxidation in Nrf2shRNA cells correlated with reduced survival as measured by clonogenic assay. Radiation-induced cell death was abrogated by pretreatment with antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine, glutathione, and vitamin-E, highlighting the importance of antioxidants in conferring protection against radiation injury. Using genetically-modified gain and loss of function models of Nrf2, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we establish that constitutive activation of Nrf2 protects against ionizing radiation toxicity and confers radioresistance.

In this study, cytotoxic activity of fascaplysin against a panel of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and putative synergism with chemotherapeutics was investigated. SCLC responds to first-line chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs/etoposide, but relapses early with topotecan remaining as the single approved therapeutic agent. Fascaplysin was found to show high cytotoxicity against SCLC cells and to induce cell cycle arrest in G1/0 at lower and S-phase at higher concentrations, respectively. The compound generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced apoptotic cell death in the chemoresistant NCI-H417 SCLC cell line. Furthermore, fascaplysin revealed marked synergism with the topoisomerase I-directed camptothecin and 10-hydroxy-camptothecin. The Poly(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor BYK 204165 antagonized the cytotoxic activity of fascaplysin, pointing to the involvement of DNA repair in response to the anticancer activity of the drug. In conclusion, fascaplysin seems to be suitable for treatment of SCLC, based on high cytotoxic activity through multiple routes of action, affecting topoisomerase I, integrity of DNA and generation of ROS.

Although antagonist G blocks SCLC cell growth (IC50 = 24.5 +/- 1.5 and 38.5 +/- 1.5 microM for the H69 and H510 cell lines respectively), its exact mechanism of action is unclear. This study shows that antagonist G stimulates apoptosis as assessed by morphology (EC50 = 5.9 +/- 0.1 and 15.2 +/- 2.7 microM for the H69 and H510 cell lines respectively) and stimulates c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in SCLC cells (EC50 = 3.2 +/- 0.1 and 15.2 +/- 2.7 microM). This activity is neuropeptide-independent, but dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is inhibited by the free radical scavenger n-acetyl cysteine. Furthermore, antagonist G itself induces inflammation (59% increase in oedema volume compared to control) and potentiates (by 35-40%) bradykinin-induced oedema formation in vivo. In view of these results we show that, as well as acting as a 'broad-spectrum' neuropeptide antagonist, antagonist G stimulates basal G-protein activity in SCLC cell membranes (81 +/- 12% stimulation at 10 microM), thereby displaying a unique ability to stimulate certain signal transduction pathways by activating G-proteins.

Overexpression of Sirt3 using adenovirus significantly inhibited the growth of the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. In this cell line, overexpression of Sirt3 induced apoptosis, which was evidenced by Annexin V + PI assay and cleaved caspase-3 immunoblotting. Furthermore, overexpression of Sirt3 increased the bax/bcl-2 and bad/bcl-x/L ratios, and promoted AIF translocation to the nucleus. Finally, Sirt3 overexpression upregulated p53 and p21 protein levels, and decreased intracellular ROS levels. Collectively, our data suggest that Sirt3 is a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma development and progression and may be a promising therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma.",

We carried out fluorescent in situ hybridization with ROS1 and centromere enumeration 6 probes and immunohistochemistry for ROS1 protein expression. ROS1 rearrangement was detected in 3 of 375 samples (0.8 %); all of whom were female, never-smokers, and harbored an adenocarcinoma component. ROS1 gene CNG was found in 18 cases (4.8 %). ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p = 0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p <0.001) than the group without CNG. Multivariate analysis confirmed that ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with poorer DFS (hazard ratio [HR]=2.16, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-3.81, p = 0.008), and OS ([HR] = 2.53, 95 % [CI] = 1.31-4.89, p = 0.006). ROS1 protein overexpression was observed in 5.0 % (18 out of 357), of which 2 cases harbored ROS1 gene rearrangement. There was no statistically significant correlation between ROS1 gene CNG and protein overexpression. This study demonstrated ROS1 gene rearrangement was detected in 0.8 % of surgically resected NSCLC; and ROS1 gene CNG is an independent poor prognostic factor.

However, the molecular mechanisms behind this malignancy have yet to be established. In the present study, we examined the effects of Tan-IIA on human small cell lung cancer H146 cells in vitro. The cytotoxicity of Tan-IIA in H146 cells was measured using the MTT assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ in H146 cells were detected by flow cytometry, and the protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, NF-κBp65, GADD153 and β-actin in H146 cells was measured by Western blotting. H146 cells were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The protein expression of GADD153 and Caspase-3 was increased, but the proto-oncogene bcl-2 was notably decreased in H146 cells treated with Tan-IIA (5 µg/ml) for 24 h. FACS showed that Tan-IIA may increase the production of ROS and Ca2+, but decreases MMP. The results indicate that Tan-IIA is capable of inhibiting the proliferation of H146 cells. One of the molecular mechanisms behind this effect may be the induction of ROS release and the decrease in MMP caused by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Another may involve endoplasmic reticulum stress caused by the release of Ca2+ and an increase in GADD153 expression followed by a decrease in Bcl-2 expression, which induces a higher ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, in turn causing a decrease in MMP and leading to an increase in Caspase-3 expression and the inhibition of H146 cells. Thus, Tan-IIA may be a promising novel chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of human small cell lung cancer H146 cells.",

In recent years, several intracellular pathways have been studied in order to discover a potential target for novel anticancer therapies such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and reactive oxygen species 1 (ROS1). Increased interest in oncologic treatment research has resulted from the observation that ALK- and ROS1-associated tyrosine kinases show molecular analogies in some of their domains. This discovery led to the hypothesis that target therapy against ALK translocation could have efficacy also in ROS1-positive tumors.

Here, we show that MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1), the mammalian 8-oxodGTPase that sanitizes oxidative damage in the nucleotide pool, is important for maintaining several KRAS-driven pro-malignant traits in a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) model. MTH1 suppression in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells impairs proliferation and xenograft tumor formation. Furthermore, MTH1 levels modulate KRAS-induced transformation of immortalized lung epithelial cells. MTH1 expression is upregulated by oncogenic KRAS and correlates positively with high KRAS levels in NSCLC human tumors. At a molecular level, in p53-competent KRAS-mutant cells, MTH1 loss provokes DNA damage and induction of oncogene-induced senescence. In p53-nonfunctional KRAS-mutant cells, MTH1 suppression does not produce DNA damage but reduces proliferation and leads to an adaptive decrease in KRAS expression levels. Thus, MTH1 not only enables evasion of oxidative DNA damage and its consequences, but can also function as a molecular rheostat for maintaining oncogene expression at optimal levels. Accordingly, our results indicate MTH1 is a novel and critical component of oncogenic KRAS-associated malignancy and its inhibition is likely to yield significant tumor-suppressive outcomes in KRAS-driven tumors.

Many of them had been reported even before its approval leading to the rapid development of second-generation ALK inhibitors for crizotinib-resistant NSCLC.

The present study aims to investigate whether GA would be synergistic with cisplatin (CDDP) against the NSCLC.;1-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT), combination index (CI) isobologram, western blot, quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, xenograft tumour models and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling analysis were used in this study.;The cell viability results showed that sequential CDDP-GA treatment resulted in a strong synergistic action in A549, NCI-H460, and NCI-H1299 cell lines, whereas the reverse sequence and simultaneous treatments led to a slight synergistic or additive action. Increased sub-G1 phase cells and enhanced PARP cleavage demonstrated that the sequence of CDDP-GA treatment markedly increased apoptosis in comparison with other treatments. Furthermore, the sequential combination could enhance the activation of caspase-3, -8, and 9, increase the expression of Fas and Bax, and decrease the expression of Bcl-2, survivin and X-inhibitor of apoptosis protein (X-IAP) in A549 and NCI-H460 cell lines. In addition, increased apoptosis was correlated with enhanced reactive oxygen species generation. Importantly, it was found that, followed by CDDP treatment, GA could inhibit NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signalling pathways, which have been validated to reduce ROS release and confer CDDP resistance. The roles of NF-κB and MAPK pathways were further confirmed by using specific inhibitors, which significantly increased ROS release and apoptosis induced by the sequential combination of CDDP and GA. Moreover, our results indicated that the combination of CDDP and GA exerted increased antitumour effects on A549 xenograft models through inhibiting NF-κB, HO-1, and subsequently inducing apoptosis.;Gambogic acid sensitises lung cancer cells to CDDP in vitro and in vivo in NSCLC through inactivation of NF-κB and MAPK/HO-1 signalling pathways, providing a rationale for the combined use of CDDP and GA in lung cancer chemotherapy.",

Recently, several studies have shown that curcumin inhibits the expansion of MDSCs in some cancers. However, it is not clear how curcumin modulates the suppressive function of MDSCs, and whether curcumin achieves anti-tumor effects via regulating the expansion of MDSCs in lung cancer. Here, our results showed that curcumin significantly inhibited tumor growth in a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) isogenic tumor model. Curcumin reduced the accumulation of MDSCs in spleen and tumor tissue in LLC isogenic model. And curcumin promoted the maturation and differentiation of MDSCs in tumor tissue. Notably, curcumin inhibited the expression level of immune suppressive factors of MDSCs, arginase-1 (Arg-1) and ROS, in purified MDSCs from tumor tissue in vivo. Expectedly, curcumin also inhibited the immunosuppressive function of isolated MDSCs from tumor tissue and spleen of tumor bearing mice in vitro. Moreover, curcumin decreased the level of IL-6 in the tumor tissue and serum from LLC-bearing mice. Taken together, curcumin indeed possesses anti-cancer effect and inhibits the accumulation and function of MDSCs. And curcumin reduces the level of IL-6 in tumor-bearing mice to impair the expansion and function of MDSCs. These results suggest that inhibition of MDSCs in tumor is requisite for controlling lung cancer. ",

Thiol compounds (N-acetylcysteine and N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine) and free radical scavengers reduced MG132-induced cell death.

We found that paclitaxel activated Stat3 in the human lung cancer cell lines PC14PE6AS2 (AS2) and H157, whereas it reduced Stat3 activation in A549 and H460 cells. Pretreatment of AS2 and H157 cells with rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), or carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler, suppressed the paclitaxel-induced activation of Stat3. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2), located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, can reduce ROS production in conditions of oxidative stress. UCP-2 protein expression in the four cancer cell lines was higher than that in normal lung epithelial cells (NL-20), but its expression was lower in AS2 and H157 cells relative to A549 and H460 cells. Silencing high UCP-2 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in A549 and H460 cells restored paclitaxel-induced Stat3 activation. In addition, paclitaxel-induced Stat3 activation led to the upregulation of survivin and Mcl-1, which in turn facilitated cell survival. Moreover, the CL1-5 subline had lower UCP-2 expression relative to the parental CL1-0 cells. Treatment with paclitaxel activated Stat3 in CL1-5 but not in CL1-0 cells, whereas in CL1-5 cells, the overexpression of UCP-2 with complementary DNA (cDNA) blocked Stat3 activation. In lung cancer patients, low UCP-2 expression in cancer cells was a predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy. Therefore, UCP-2 modulates the ROS/Stat3 signaling pathway and response to chemotherapy treatment in lung cancer cells. Targeting UCP-2, ROS and Stat3 pathways may improve anticancer therapies.",

Personalized therapy encompasses the strategy of matching these subtypes with effective targeted therapies. EGFR mutations and ALK translocation are the most effectively targeted oncogenes in NSCLC. EGFR mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are successfully being targeted with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The number of molecular subgroups of NSCLC continues to grow. The scope of this review is to discuss recent data on novel molecular targets as ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, HER2, c-MET, RET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and DDR2.

Although high response rates and disease control have been observed in lung cancer patients bearing rearranged ROS1 tumors (ROS1+) treated with the kinase inhibitor crizotinib, many of these patients eventually relapse.To identify mechanisms of resistance to ROS1 inhibitors we generated resistant cells from HCC78 lung cancer cells bearing the SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement. We found that activation of the RAS pathway in the HCC78 cell model, due to either KRAS/NRAS mutations or to KRAS amplification, rendered the cells resistant to ROS1 inhibition. These cells were cross-resistant to different ROS1 inhibitors, but sensitive to inhibitors of the RAS signaling pathway. Interestingly, we identified focal KRAS amplification in a biopsy of a tumor from a patient that had become resistant to crizotinib treatment.Altogether our data suggest that the activation of members of the RAS family can confer resistance to ROS1 inhibitors. This has important clinical implications as: (i) RAS genetic alterations in ROS1+ primary tumors are likely negative predictors of efficacy for targeted drugs and (ii) this kind of resistance is unlikely to be overcome by the use of more specific or more potent ROS1 targeting drugs.

However, little is known about the biological effect of ajoene on lung adenocarcinoma, an aggressive malignancy with dismal prognosis. We investigated the biological effect of ajoene on lung adenocarcinoma and the underlying pathway. Lung adenocarcinoma cells A549, NCI-H1373, and NCI-H1395, along with the noncancerous lung bronchus cells BEAS-2B, were used. MTT test showed that ajoene (25 μM) reduces viability of lung adenocarcinoma cells but not the noncancerous BEAS-2B cells. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay revealed that ajoene inhibits proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment of lung adenocarcinoma cells with ajoene enhances apoptosis and ROS generation in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Abrogation of caspase activation by zVAD-fmk completely prevents the ajoene-induced apoptosis; whereas block of ROS generation by N-acetylcysteine partly abolishes the ajoene-induced apoptosis. ROS-mediated induction of apoptosis contributes partially to the anti-tumorigenic property of ajoene observed, a phenomenon also confirmed by xenograft tumor study. Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), pivots of ROS-mediated signaling pathway, are activated upon ajoene treatment; Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 activations are required for signaling pathway underlying the ajoene-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that ROS-mediated activation of JNK/p38 contributes partially to the pro-apoptotic action of ajoene on cells of lung adenocarcinoma. Ajoene may be a promising chemotherapeutic agent for lung adenocarcinoma. ",

However, there are very few reports on the molecular profiles of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). We therefore conducted the present Shizuoka Lung Cancer Mutation Study to analyze genomic aberrations in patients with thoracic malignancies.;We collected samples of SCLC from a biobank system and analyzed their molecular profiles. We assessed 23 mutations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2) using pyrosequencing plus capillary electrophoresis. We also amplified EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the fusion genes ALK, ROS1, and RET using reverse transcription PCR.;Between July 2011 and January 2013, 60 SCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Samples included eight surgically resected snap-frozen samples, 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and seven pleural effusion samples. We detected 13 genomic aberrations in nine cases (15%), including an EGFR mutation (n=1, G719A), a KRAS mutation (n=1, G12D), PIK3CA mutations (n=3, E542K, E545K, E545Q), an AKT1 mutation (n=1, E17K), a MET amplification (n=1), and PIK3CA amplifications (n=6). EGFR and KRAS mutations were found in patients with combined SCLC and adenocarcinoma. No significant differences were detected in the characteristics of patients with and without genomic aberrations. However, serum neuron-specific enolase and progastrin-releasing peptide levels were significantly higher in patients without genomic aberrations than in those with aberrations (p=0.01 and 0.04, respectively).;Genomic aberrations were found in 15% SCLC patients, with PIK3CA amplifications most frequently observed. To further our understanding of the molecular profiles of SCLC, comprehensive mutational analyses should be conducted using massive parallel sequencing.",

In this communication, we studied the potential efficacy of the treatment of osteosarcoma pulmonary metastases with a systemic delivery route of Ad-OC-TK supplemented with ACV. We established osteosarcoma lung metastases in nude mice by the intravenous injection of rat osteosarcoma cells, ROS 17/2.8. These cells colonized and formed tumor nodules within 1 week in the lungs of nude mice. Whereas systemic delivery of a recombinant Ad vector containing the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene driven by a Rous sarcoma virus universal promoter (Ad-RSV-beta-gal) resulted in the nonspecific expression of beta-gal activity in the lung parenchyma, Ad-OC-beta-gal administration resulted in specific beta-gal expression in tumor cells deposited in the lung. When nude mice bearing ROS 17/2.8 lung tumors were treated with systemic Ad-OC-TK through tail vein administration, subsequent intraperitoneal ACV treatment significantly decreased the number of tumor nodules (P < .0001) and the net lung wet weight (P = .0005) while significantly increasing (.005 < P < .01) the survival of animals, when compared with untreated and Ad-OC-TK- or ACV-treated control groups.

These were, respectively, a well-circumscribed T1N0M0 lesion, an irregularly shaped T2N0M0 lesion, and a T2N2M0 tumour. Detailed diagnostic radiology reports were provided and contours were entered into a 3D planning system. The target volumes were calculated and beams-eye view (BEV) plots were generated to visualise differences in contouring. A software tool was used to expand the GTV and CTV in three dimensions for an automatically derived PTV.;Significant inter-RO variations in contoured target volumes were observed for all patients, and these were greater than intra-RO differences. The ratio of the largest to smallest contoured volume ranged from 1.6 for the GTV in the T1N0 lesion, to 2.0 for the PTV in the T2N2 lesion. The BEV plots revealed significant inter-RO variations in contouring the mediastinal CTV. The PTV's derived using a 3D margin programme were larger than manually contoured PTV's. These variations did not correlate with the experience of ROs.;Despite the use of an institutional contouring protocol, significant interclinician variations persist in contouring target volumes in NSCLC. Additional measures to decrease such variations should be incorporated into clinical trials.",

To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to investigate the combined effects of anticancer drugs and radiotherapy. In this study, to evaluate the role of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the radiation-induced cell death of tumor cells, we have examined the effect of 3-methyl pyruvate (MP). MP is a membrane-permeable pyruvate derivative that is capable of activating mitochondrial energy metabolism in human lung carcinoma A549 cells and murine squamous carcinoma SCCVII cells. Pretreatment with MP significantly enhanced radiation-induced cell death in both cell lines, and also led to increases in the mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria-derived ROS production following the exposure of the cells to X-rays. In A549 cells, MP-induced radiosensitization was completely abolished by vitamin C. In contrast, it was partially abolished in SCCVII cells. These results therefore suggest that the treatment of the cells with MP induced radiosensitization via the production of excess mitochondria-derived ROS in tumor cells. ",

The radon-derived ionizing radiation and some components of cigarette smoke induce oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Respiratory lung cells are subject to the ROS that causes DNA breaks, which subsequently bring about DNA mutagenesis and are intimately linked with carcinogenesis. The damaged cells by oxidative stress are often destroyed through the active apoptotic pathway. However, the ROS also perform critical signaling functions in stress responses, cell survival, and cell proliferation. Some molecules enhance radiation-induced tumor cell killing via the reduction in DNA repair levels. Hence the DNA repair levels may be a novel therapeutic modality in overcoming drug resistance in lung cancer. Either survival or apoptosis, which is determined by the balance between DNA damage and DNA repair levels, may lender the major problems in cancer therapy. The purpose of this paper is to take a closer look at risk factor and at therapy modulation factor in lung cancer relevant to the ROS. ",

Despite major advances in targeted therapy in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas, the overall 5-year survival rate for lung cancer worldwide has not significantly changed for the last few decades. DNA repair deficiency is known to contribute to lung cancer development. In fact, human polymorphisms in DNA repair genes such as xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) are highly associated with lung cancer incidence. However, the direct genetic evidence for the role of XPC for lung cancer development is still lacking. Mutations of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras) or its downstream effector genes occur in almost all lung cancer cells, and there are a number of mouse models for lung cancer with these mutations. Using activated Kras, Kras(LA1), as a driver for lung cancer development in mice, we showed for the first time that mice with Kras(LA1) and Xpc knockout had worst outcomes in lung cancer development, and this phenotype was associated with accumulated DNA damage. Using cultured cells, we demonstrated that induced expression of oncogenic KRAS(G12V) led to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as DNA damage, and both can be suppressed by anti-oxidants.

The IC50 was achieved only in two of eight tested cell lines, melanoma 518A2 and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29. Self-propagating room temperature method was applied to produce CONP with an average crystalline size of 4 nm. The results confirmed presence of Ce(3+) and O(2-) vacancies. The induction of cell death by CONP and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed by flow-cytometry. Free radicals related antioxidant capacity of the cells was studied by the reduction of stable free radical TEMPONE using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. CONP showed low or moderate cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines: adenocarcinoma DLD1 and multi-drug resistant DLD1-TxR, non-small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H460 and multi-drug resistant NCI-H460/R, while normal cell lines (keratinocytes HaCaT, lung fetal fibroblasts MRC-5) were insensitive. The most sensitive were 518A2 melanoma and HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, with the IC50 values being between 100 and 200 μM. Decreased rate of TEMPONE reduction and increased production of certain ROS species (peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide anion) indicates that free radical metabolism, thus redox status was changed, and antioxidant capacity damaged in the CONP treated 518A2 and HT-29 cells. In conclusion, changes in intracellular redox status induced by CONP are partly attributed to the prooxidant activity of the nanoparticles. Further, ROS induced cell damages might eventually lead to the cell death. However, low inhibitory potential of CONP in the other human cell lines tested indicates that CONP may be safe for human usage in industry and medicine.",

Prx II was remarkably increased only in A549/GR (gefitinib-resistant) cells compared with A549 cells, consistent with methylation/demethylation. Prx II was highly methylated in the A549 cells but was demethylated in the A549/GR cells. The elevated expression of Prx II resulted in the downregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death and upregulation of cell cycle progression in the A549/GR cells. When Prx II mRNA in the A549/GR cells was knocked down, the levels of ROS and apoptosis were significantly recovered to the levels of the controls. In addition, signaling molecules involved in apoptosis were increased in the A549/GR-shPrx II cells. There was no difference in the expression of MAPK/ERK between the A549/GR cells and A549/GR-shPrx II cells, but the phosphorylation of JNK was increased in the A549/GR cells and was markedly decreased in the A549/GR-shPrx II cells.

Although the role of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) in cell survival signaling is well documented, whether RIP1 is directly involved in cancer development has never been studied. In this report, we found that RIP1 expression is substantially increased in human non-small cell lung cancer and mouse lung tumor tissues. RIP1 expression was remarkably increased in cigarette smoke-exposed mouse lung. In human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), RIP1 was significantly induced by cigarette smoke extract or benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the active form of the tobacco-specific carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene. In RIP1 knockdown HBECs, BPDE-induced cytotoxicity was significantly increased, which was associated with induction of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. Scavenging ROS suppressed BPDE-induced MAPK activation and inhibiting ROS or MAPKs substantially blocked BPDE-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting ROS-mediated MAPK activation is involved in BPDE-induced cell death. The ROS-reducing enzyme catalase is destabilized in an ERK- and JNK-dependent manner in RIP1 knockdown HBECs and application of catalase effectively blocked BPDE-induced ROS accumulation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, BPDE-induced transformation of HBECs was significantly reduced when RIP1 expression was suppressed. Altogether, these results strongly suggest an oncogenic role for RIP1, which promotes malignant transformation through protecting DNA-damaged cells against carcinogen-induced cytotoxicity associated with excessive ROS production.

However, the relationship between de novo MET expression and patient outcomes remains unclear.;We reviewed the data of patients who had been diagnosed with NSCLC between December 2013 and October 2014. All the patients were evaluated for MET expression status. MET-positive was defined as having an H-score ≥ 60 by immunohistochemistry analysis. MET expression was analyzed in 158 patients who were negative for the common driver genes, including EGFR, ALK, KRAS and ROS1. A chi-squared test was used to assess the clinicopathological parameters. Multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.;MET data were available for analysis in 158 advanced NSCLC patients. Of these, based on the MET H-score criteria, the IHC-positive rate was 48.1% (76/158). There were more patients with adenocarcinoma in the MET-positive group compared with the MET-negative group (P=0.01). Nine patients with lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma had no MET expression. There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between MET-positive and -negative patients. There was also no significant difference in the efficacy (Z=-0.44, P=0.66) or progression free survival (PFS) of first-line chemotherapy between the MET-positive and -negative patients (mPFS 6.8 months [95% CI: 5.4-8.2] vs. 5.9 months [5.5-6.3], P=0.92). In the cell model, the MET-positive cell showed no difference in chemotherapy but with a increase in percentage of growth inhibition upon treatment with MET inhibitor INC280 compared to MET-negative cell.;Our data showed that de novo MET expression was not rare. It was not a predictive or prognostic factor for stage IV NSCLC patients, but this should be confirmed in larger population cohort.",

The approval was based on a clinically meaningful, durable objective response rate (ORR) in a multicenter, single-arm clinical trial (ROS1 cohort of Trial PROFILE 1001) in patients with ROS1-positive mNSCLC. The trial enrolled 50 patients (age range: 25-77 years) whose tumors were prospectively determined to have a ROS1 gene rearrangement by break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (96%) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (4%) clinical trial assays. Crizotinib demonstrated an ORR of 66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51%-79%) with a median duration of response of 18.3 months by independent radiology review and 72% (95% CI: 58%-84%) by investigator review. Patients received crizotinib 250 mg twice daily and had a median duration of exposure of 34.4 months. The toxicity profile in ROS1-positive patients was generally consistent with the randomized safety data in the U.S. Product Insert from two ALK-positive mNSCLC trials. The most common (≥25%) adverse reactions and laboratory test abnormalities included vision disorders, elevation of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels, nausea, hypophosphatemia, diarrhea, edema, vomiting, constipation, neutropenia, and fatigue. There were no treatment-related deaths. A favorable benefit-to-risk evaluation led to the traditional approval of crizotinib for this new supplemental indication.;Given the results from the ROS1 cohort of the clinical trial PROFILE 1001, crizotinib represents a new treatment option and the first approved therapy for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors are ROS1 positive. Crizotinib demonstrated efficacy irrespective of prior treatment status.",

The aim of this study was to investigate any connection between ERRalpha activity and cell population growth.;XCT-790, an ERRa specific inverse agonist, was employed to suppress ERRa activity in human non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) A549. Gene expressions were detected using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Mitochondrial mass, membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by staining with Mitotracker green, JC-1 and CM-H(2)DCFDA dyes respectively.

It was further demonstrated that XCT-790-induced ROS modulated p53 and Rb signalling pathways and suppressed cell replication.;ERRalpha affects cell cycle mechanisms through modulating mitochondrial mass and function.

Ultimately, however, patients fatally relapse. In this review we will focus on the search to improve survival for NSCLC patients deemed to be pan-negative for the common driver alterations susceptible to targeted therapy, above all those with EGFR mutations or ALK, ROS or RET translocations. Other uncommon driver mutations such as HER2 and BRAF mutations should be tested in order to rule out targeted treatment before assigning patients to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy yields short lived response with median survival still less than one year. Customized chemotherapy represents one way to attempt to prolong survival, although to date no prospective randomized customized studies have reported sufficient evidence to support this. In one attempt to demonstrate the role of tailoring chemotherapy, the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) phase II customized chemotherapy trial (NCT00883480) showed that RAP80, a component of the BRCA1-A complex, influenced outcome in patients with low BRCA1 expression treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine, and in patients with intermediate/high BRCA1 levels receiving cisplatin/docetaxel or docetaxel alone. We are currently performing a prospective, randomized phase III trial comparing non-customized cisplatin/docetaxel with customized therapy in metastatic NSCLC patients (NCT00617656/GECP-BREC) and a parallel phase II study (ChiCTR-TRC-12001860) is being carried out in China (BREC-China) under the auspices of the SLCG.

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancers are characterised by abundant genetic diversity with relatively few recurrent mutations occurring at high frequency. However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities. It is hoped that these discoveries may make a major contribution to improving outcome for patients with this poor prognosis disease. ",

Currently, only human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy has been successful in significantly prolonging the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC). There is a need for the discovery of additional novel targets in GC.;Anti-ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to screen 495 GC samples and was followed by simultaneous ROS1 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses in IHC-positive samples. Fusion partners in ROS1-rearranged GC were determined by RT-PCR. In all 495 samples, HER2 amplification was identified with FISH, and MET expression was identified by IHC.;Twenty-three tumor samples were ROS1 IHC-positive.

The downregulation of anti-oxidant defenses, in mI-kappaB-Line 1 cells, correlates with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS damage to cellular macromolecules while the upregulation of metabolic nuclear receptors correlates with an adaptive/survival response, which involves a shift in energy metabolism toward beta-oxidative respiration. Accordingly, mI-kappaB-Line 1 cells are markedly sensitized to pharmacologic inhibition of beta-oxidative respiration. These findings are indicative of compensatory changes that could undermine anti-cancer therapies targeting NF-kappaB.",

Little is known about cancers harboring these mutations aside from their lack of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, impairing the development of effective targeted therapies.;NSCLC patients with EGFR genotyping were studied using a mechanism approved by the Institutional Review Board. Cancers with exon 20 insertions were indentified, sequences were characterized, and effectiveness of different treatment regimens was reviewed retrospectively. Clinical characteristics and survival were compared with cancers harboring common EGFR mutations and cancers with wild-type EGFR.;One thousand eighty-six patients underwent EGFR genotyping from 2004 to 2012. Twenty seven (2.5%) harbored exon 20 insertions, making up 9.2% of all cancers with documented EGFR mutations. Compared with wild-type cancers, those with exon 20 insertions were more commonly found in never-smokers and Asian patients. Insertion sequences were highly variable, with the most common variant (V769_D770insASV) making up only 22% of cases. Median survival of patients with exon 20 insertions was 16 months, similar to the survival of wild-type cancers and shorter than the survival of cancers with common EGFR mutations.;Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions have similar clinical characteristics to those with common EGFR mutations but a poorer prognosis. The prevalence of this subset of NSCLC is similar to that of other genotype-defined subsets of lung adenocarcinoma (e.g. those with BRAF mutations, HER2 insertions, ROS1 rearrangements) and is a population of interest for trials of new targeted therapies.",

LC patients were additionally subdivided into three immunohistochemistry groups based on positive expression of TTF-1/Napsin A (adenocarcinoma-like, n = 24; 59%), CK5/P40 (squamous-like, n = 5; 12%), or no marker expression (marker-negative, n = 12; 29%).

In general, LCs showed more oncogene mutations compared to LCNECs. Immunomarker stratification of LC revealed oncogene mutations in 63% of adenocarcinoma-like cases, but only in 17% of marker-negative cases. Moreover, marker-negative LCs were associated with inferior overall survival compared with adenocarcinoma-like tumors (p = 0.007). No ALK, RET or ROS1 fusions were detected in LCs or LCNECs. Together, our molecular analyses support that LC and LCNEC tumors follow different tumorigenic paths and that LC may be stratified into molecular subgroups with potential implications for diagnosis, prognostics, and therapy decisions.

Herein, we report the chemotherapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of PA against human lung cancer.;The anti-proliferative ability of PA on lung cancer cells was assessed by MTT, colony formation and EdU proliferation assays. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect cell cycle changes. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V/PI double-staining and the DNA ladder formation assays. The expressions of the apoptosis-related proteins were analysed by western blot. The in vivo efficacy of PA was measured using a NCI-H23 xenograft model in nude mice.;PA exhibited anti-tumor effects in vitro accompanied by induction of G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in NCI-H23 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, our data showed that PA induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in the activation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptotic pathways in lung cancer cells. Moreover, blockage of ROS production reversed PA-induced JNK and ER stress activation. Finally, PA inhibited the growth of NCI-H23 xenograft tumors without causing any host toxicity, and inhibited cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis of tumor cells in tumor xenograft tissues.;In summary, our study demonstrates that PA induces apoptosis through activation of the JNK and ER stress pathways in human lung cancer cells.

Recently (Hemström et al., Exp Cell Res 2005;305:200-13) we showed that apoptosis of U1810 NSCLC cells induced by the staurosporine analog PKC 412 correlated with inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2, suggesting the involvement of these kinases in cell survival. Here we investigated the contribution of the PI3-kinase/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways to survival of NSCLC cells. The two signaling pathways were studied by using different combinations of the PI3-kinase inhibitors LY-294002 and wortmannin, the Akt activator Ro 31-8220, the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 and PKC 412. PI3-kinase inhibitors induced apoptosis-like death in U1810 cells. H157 cells in general were relatively resistant to PI3 kinase/Akt inhibitors yet these compounds sensitized cells to the DNA-damaging drug VP-16, while Ro 31-8220 could not. PD 98059 only had a sensitizing effect on H157 cells when combined with PI3-kinase inhibition and VP-16. Morphological data indicated that LY-294002 and PKC 412 induced cell death at anaphase and metaphase, respectively, suggesting death by mitotic catastrophe. Analyzes of cells blocked in G2/M-phase by nocodazol revealed that LY-294002 increased, while PKC 412 decreased histone H3 phosphorylation, suggesting that LY-294002 allowed, while PKC 412 inhibited cells to leave M-phase. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution demonstrated that LY-294002 allowed cells to leave G2/M phase, while PKC 412 inhibited cytokinesis, resulting in formation of multinucleated cells. These results indicate that sensitization of NSCLC cells by PI3-kinase inhibition involves interplay between cell cycle regulation, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis.",

We previously showed that antioxidant proteins such as peroxiredoxins were specifically upregulated in lung metastatic breast cancer cells. We hypothesize that cancer cells that live under aerobic conditions, as might be the case in lungs, protect themselves against the damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). To examine this hypothesis, we studied the role of peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) in lung vs bone metastasis formation. A metastatic variant of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells that specifically metastasize to lungs (435-L3) was transduced with short hairpin RNAs to specifically silence PRDX2. Conversely, a bone metastatic variant of MDA-MB-231 cells (BO2) was stably transfected to overexpress PRDX2. The 435-L3 cells silenced for PRDX2 were significantly more sensitive to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress than the parental and scrambled transfected cells. BO2/PRDX2 cells produced less ROS than BO2/green fluorescent protein control cells under oxidative stress. Moreover, PRDX2 knockdown inhibited the growth of 435-L3 cells in the lungs, whereas lymph node metastasis remained unaffected. In contrast, PRDX2 overexpression in bone metastatic BO2 breast cancer cells led to drastic inhibition of the skeletal tumor burden and reduction of bone destruction. Furthermore, PRDX2 expression in breast cancer cells was associated with a glucose-dependent phenotype, different from bone metastatic cells. Overall, our results strongly suggest that PRDX2 is a targetable 'metabolic adaptor' driver protein implicated in the selective growth of metastatic cells in the lungs by protecting them against oxidative stress.",

Plasma MDA levels, determined by reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA), were not significantly different (p=0.479), whereas plasma carbonyl levels were elevated (p=0.003). Free radical production in lung cancer patients thus appeared high. Smoker controls also tended to exhibit lower MnSOD and higher carbonyl radicals than their non-smoking counterparts.

To identify genes involved in the enhancement of cell death, a total gene profiling in response to co-administration of (i) PKC 412 with IR, or (ii) Ro 31-8220 with IR was implemented. These combined treatments caused upregulation of 140 and 179 genes and downregulation of 253 and 425 genes, respectively. Certain genes were selected and verified by real-time quantitative PCR and, of these genes, robust suppression of Ephrin B3 expression was suggested as a possible cell death-inducing mechanism of combined treatment with IR and PKC 412. Indeed, silencing of Ephrin B3 using siRNA in NSCLC cells resulted in a major alteration of their morphology with an elongated phenotype, decreased proliferation and increased cell death signaling. Moreover, silencing of Ephrin B3 in combination with IR caused a decrease in IR-mediated G(2)-arrest, induced cellular senescence, inhibited MAPK ERK and p38 phosphorylation, and caused an upregulation of p27(kip1) expression. Finally, silencing of Ephrin B3 in combination with IR sensitized U-1810 cells to IR-induced apoptosis.

Furthermore, inhibition of HO-1 by siRNA and a specific HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP augments cisplatin cytotoxicity toward A549 cells. Pharmacologic suppression of HO-1 activity resulted in a marked increase in the ROS generation in cisplatin-treated cells.

Here, we repurposed antibiotic levofloxacin for lung cancer treatment. We show that levofloxacin is effectively against a panel of lung cancer cell lines via inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis, regardless of cellular origin and genetic pattern, in in vitro cell culture system and in vivo xenograft lung tumor model. Mechanistically, levofloxacin inhibits activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I and III, leading to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and reduction of ATP production. In addition, levofloxacin significantly increases levels of ROS, mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in vitro and oxidative stress markers (HEL and 4-HNE) in vivo. Antioxidants, such as NAC and vitamin C, prevent the inhibitory effects of levofloxacin, confirming the induction of oxidative damage as the mechanism of its action in lung cancer cells. Our work demonstrates that levofloxacin is a useful addition to the treatment of lung cancer. Our work also suggests that targeting mitochondria may be an alternative therapeutic strategy for lung cancer treatment.",

To investigate the mechanism underlying PPARγ ligand-induced radiosensitization, the subdiploid cellular DNA fraction was analyzed by flow cytometry. Activation of the caspase pathway by combined PPARγ ligands and γ-radiation treatment was detected by immunoblot analysis.

The combined PPARγ ligand/γ-radiation treatment triggered caspase-8 activation, and this initiator caspase played an important role in the combination-induced apoptosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligands may enhance the γ-radiation-induced DNA damage response, possibly by increasing γ-H2AX expression. Moreover, the combination treatment significantly increased ROS generation, and the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine inhibited the combined treatment-induced ROS generation and apoptotic cell death.;Taken together, these results indicated that the combined treatment of PPARγ ligands and γ-radiation synergistically induced DNA damage and apoptosis, which was regulated by ROS.",

Cellular manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity (units/mg protein) decreased significantly after 24 hours of hypoxia. In normoxic culture after hypoxia, the cells produced increased ROS, detected as dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence and H(2)O(2) accumulation in medium. Antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac) and ebselen inhibited increased DCF fluorescence after hypoxia. To test their ability to tolerate oxidant stress, some cells were incubated with antimycin A (100 microM) and trifluorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (10 microM) (anti A + FCCP), a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor and respiratory chain uncoupler, which together increase mitochondrial superoxide (O(2)(-)) and H(2)O(2) production. Lung epithelial cells preexposed to hypoxia released more lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) than normoxic controls in response to increased O(2)(-) production. Increased LDH release from hypoxia-preexposed cells treated with anti A + FCCP was inhibited by 1 mM N-Ac.

Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib). Notably, increasing feasibility, accessibility, and application of molecular profiling technologies has permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes. Emerging genomic aberrations for which TKIs have shown impressive results in clinical trials and expansion of drug labels for approved agents are awaited include ROS1 rearrangements (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib) and BRAF-V600E mutations (1-3% of tumors, drugs: vemurafenib, dafrafenib + trametinib). Evolving genomic events in which TKI responses have been reported in smaller series include MET exon 14 skipping mutations (2-4% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); high-level MET amplification (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); RET rearrangements (1% of tumors, drug: cabozantinib); and ERBB2 mutations (2-3% of tumors, drug: afatinib), among others. Unfortunately, the most common genomic event in NSCLC, KRAS mutations (25-30% of tumors), is not targetable with approved or in development small molecule inhibitors. Here, we review currently approved, emerging, and evolving systemic precision therapies matched with their driver oncogenes for the management of advanced NSCLC. ",

Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Cell necrosis was evaluated with LDH assay. The expression of apoptosis- or autophagy-associated proteins was measured using Western blotting. The formation of acidic compartments was detected using AO staining, neutral red staining and Lysotracker-Red staining. LC3 punctae were analyzed with fluorescence microscopy.;Treatment with 3,4,4'-THS (10-80 μmol/L) concentration-dependently inhibited the cell viability. It did not cause cell necrosis, but induced apoptosis accompanied by up-regulation of cleavaged PARP, caspase3/9 and Bax, and by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and surviving. It also increased the formation of acidic compartments, LC3-II accumulation and GFP-LC3 labeled autophagosomes in the cells. It inhibited the mTOR-dependent pathway, but did not impair autophagic flux. 3,4,4'-THS-induced cell death was enhanced by the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA (5 mmol/L) or Wortmannin (2 μmol/L).

PKD activation induced by PDB in these SCLC cell lines was completely abrogated by treatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (GF I) at concentrations (0.5-2.5 microM) that did not inhibit PKD activity when added directly to the in vitro kinase assays. Treatment with the biologically active phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or with membrane-permeable diacylglycerols also stimulated PKD activation, which was also completely prevented by prior exposure of the cells to GF I. The PKC inhibitors Ro 31-8220 and Go 7874 also blocked PKD activation in response to PDB. Addition of the autocrine growth factor bombesin to cultures of H 345 cells induced significant PKD activation that also was prevented by GF I.

However, whether inhibition of glycolysis will be effective in all types of cancer is unclear. The current study shows that a glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), exhibits the cytotoxic effect on non-small cell lung cancer in a p53-dependent manner. 2DG significantly inhibits ATP production in p53-deficient lung cancer cells (H358) but not in p53-wt cells (A549). In contrast to p53-wt cells, p53-defective cells are unable to compensate for their need of energy via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) when glycolysis is inhibited. In the presence of p53, increased ROS from OXPHOS increases the expression of p53 target genes known to modulate metabolism, including synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) and TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR). Importantly, 2DG selectively induces the expression of the antioxidant enzymes manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) in a p53-dependent manner. The results demonstrate that the killing of cancer cells by the inhibitor of glycolysis is more efficient in cancer cells without functional p53 and that p53 protects against metabolic stress by up-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and modulation of antioxidants.",

Characterization of H820 cells and evaluation of NPS-1034 efficacy in these cells were also performed. The resistance of HCC827/GR was mediated by MET activation, whereas AXL activation led to resistance in HCC827/ER. The combination of gefitinib or erlotinib with NPS-1034 synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in both resistant cell lines. Accordingly, suppression of Akt was noted only in the presence of treatment with both drugs. NPS-1034 was also effective in xenograft mouse models of HCC827/GR. Although the H820 cell line was reported previously to have T790M and MET amplification, we discovered that AXL was also activated in this cell line. There were no antitumor effects of siRNA or inhibitors specific for EGFR or MET, whereas combined treatment with AXL siRNA or NPS-1034 and EGFR-TKIs controlled H820 cells, suggesting that AXL is the main signal responsible for resistance. In addition, NPS-1034 inhibited cell proliferation as well as ROS1 activity in HCC78 cells with ROS1 rearrangement. Our results establish the efficacy of NPS-1034 in NSCLC cells rendered resistant to EGFR-TKIs because of MET or AXL activation or ROS1 rearrangement.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been postulated to render cancer cells resistant to apoptosis based on the Warburg hypothesis. However, few studies have investigated the prognostic value of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and G10398A polymorphism in NSCLC patients. mtDNA copy number and G10398A polymorphism in 128 NSCLC tissue samples were assessed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and PCR-RFLP respectively, and their relationship to prognosis were analyzed by survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. In vitro, an mtDNA deletion A549 ρ(0) cell model was utilized to assess the function of mtDNA on radiosensitivity. Cell cycle distribution and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed to elucidate the potential mechanisms. For the whole group, the median follow-up time and overall survival time were 22.5 and 23.4 months, respectively. Patients with high mtDNA content had a marginally longer survival time than patients with low mtDNA content (P=0.053). Moreover, patients with high mtDNA content plus 10398G had a significantly longer overall survival time compared with those having low mtDNA content plus 10398A (47 vs. 27 months, P<0.05). In addition, multivariate analysis showed that stage and low mtDNA content plus 10398A were the two most independent prognostic factors. In vitro, the A549 ρ(0) cells showed more resistance to radiation than ρ(+) cells. Following radiation, ρ(0) cells showed delayed G2 arrest and lower ROS level as compared to ρ(+) cells. In conclusion, the present study suggests that in patients with NSCLC, low mtDNA content plus 10398A could be a marker of poor prognosis which is associated with resistance to anticancer treatment caused by low mtDNA content plus 10398A polymorphism resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction.",

However, the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-reduced (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) proteins and the mechanism of activation for NADPH oxidase in P. aeruginosa infection are not well-defined. Here, we investigated the role of NOX2 and NOX4 proteins in P. aeruginosa infection, ROS generation, and endothelial barrier function in murine lungs and in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). Airway instillation of P. aeruginosa strain 103 (PA103) significantly increased ROS concentrations in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, along with the expression of NOX2 and NOX4, but not NOX1 and NOX3, in lung tissue. In addition, PA103-infected HLMVECs revealed elevated concentrations of ROS, NOX2, and NOX4. In murine lungs and HLMVECs, PA103 induced the NF-κB pathway, and its inhibition blocked PA103-dependent NOX2 and NOX4 expression. Barrier function analysis showed that heat-killed PA103 induced endothelial permeability in a dose-dependent manner, which was attenuated by treatment with small interfering (si)RNA specific for NOX4, but not NOX2. Furthermore, the knockdown of NOX4, but not NOX2, with siRNA reduced PA103-mediated apoptosis in HLMVECs. In vivo, the down-regulation of NOX4 with NOX4 siRNA attenuated PA103-induced lung vascular permeability. The deletion of NOX2 in mice exerted no effect on permeability, but offered significant resistance to P. aeruginosa-induced lung inflammation. These data show that P. aeruginosa lung infection up-regulates NOX2 and NOX4 expression and ROS generation, which play distinct roles in regulating lung inflammation, apoptosis, and permeability.",

We present data suggesting that resistance of fibroblasts to asbestos-induced carcinogenesis is likely to be connected with their lower ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to asbestos exposure and stricter control of proliferation of cells bearing asbestos/ROS-induced injuries. In fact, chrysotile (Mg6Si4O10(OH)8) asbestos exposure (5-10 microg/cm2) increased intracellular ROS and 8-oxo-guanine contents in rat pleural mesothelial cells, but not in lung fibroblasts. Simultaneously, moderate dosages of chrysotile and other agents increasing ROS levels (hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 and ethyl-methanesulfonate, EMS) inhibited cell cycle progression, in particular G1-to-S transition, in fibroblasts, but not in mesothelial cells. The arrested fibroblasts underwent cell death, while the majority of chrysotile-treated mesothelial cells survived. The differences in cell cycle response to asbestos/ROS-induced injuries correlated with distinct activity of p53-p21Cip1/Waf1 pathway in the two cell types. Chrysotile, H2O2 and EMS caused p53 upregulation in both cell types, but mesothelial cells, unlike fibroblasts, showed no accumulation of p21Cip1/Waf1. Of note, treatment with doxorubicin caused similar p53-dependent p21Cip1/Waf1 upregulation and cell cycle arrest in both cell types. This suggests differential response of fibroblasts and mesothelial cells specifically to asbestos/ROS exposure rather than to all DNA-damaging insults.",

However, the exact role between let-7 and K-ras in radon induced lung damage has not been explored so far. In the present study, wistar rats and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were long-term exposed to radon, and then alterations in histological pathology of rat lung tissue, ROS, antioxidant enzymes activities and clonogenic formation in HBE cells, as well as changes in let-7 and K-ras expression were determined to observe the adverse effects induced by radon. The results showed that long-term exposure to radon produced severe lung damage in rats, significantly increased ROS production and clonogenic formation ratios and decreased SOD activities in HBE cells. In addition, an obvious down-regulation of let-7 and up-regulation of K-ras were also revealed both in mRNA and in protein level in lung tissue of rats and HBE cells exposed to radon. Furthermore, a significant down-regulation of K-ras was then confirmed in both let-7b-3p and let-7a-2-3p transfected HBE cells. Taken together, the present results propose an involvement of let-7 microRNA and K-ras in radon induced lung damage both in vivo and in vitro, which may thus be of potential value in early diagnosis and therapy of radon-induced lung tumorgenesis.

The best examples of this approach are the kinase inhibitors that selectively target tumors bearing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement. Emerging protein kinase inhibitors may enhance our ability to effectively treat these and other genomic subtypes of NSCLC.;This article reviews the next-generation kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR and ALK-positive NSCLC. In addition, targeted kinase inhibitors in clinical development for other specific molecular subtypes of NSCLC are covered, including ROS1, BRAF, RET, HER2, KRAS (upstream of the MEK kinase), MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, DDR2, VEGFR and AAK.;In EGFR-mutant NSCLC, there are several kinase inhibitors with promising activity, most notably dacomitinib and CO-1686 in tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. Next-generation ALK inhibitors appear to have greater potency than crizotinib and several ongoing trials may shed light on their role in both ALK- and ROS1-positive NSCLC. While there is optimism regarding the role of kinase inhibitors in other molecular subtypes, the available evidence is too immature to make recommendations and results from prospective trials are needed.",

In the present study, we explored the anticancer properties of SAN in lung cancer using the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A1. Our results revealed that SAN inhibited SPC-A1 cell growth and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We found that SAN triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while elimination of ROS by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed the growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by SAN. SAN-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulted in the upregulation of many genes and proteins involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), p-protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Blocking ER stress with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) markedly reduced SAN-induced inhibition of growth and apoptosis. Furthermore, TUDCA decreased SAN-induced ROS production, and NAC attenuated SAN-induced GRP78 and CHOP expression. Overall, our data indicate that the anticancer effects of SAN in lung cancer cells depend on ROS production and ER stress and that SAN may be a potential agent against lung cancer.",

However, cancer cells can take advantage of thioredoxin and DJ-1 against ROS-induced cell damage. In several human cancer types, thioredoxin and DJ-1 were found to be overexpressed. The present study aimed to explore the serum levels of thioredoxin and DJ-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and its relationship to the diagnosis and prognosis of this particular malignancy. Sera from 134 NSCLC patients and 168 healthy controls were obtained. Using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, the levels of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 were measured and correlated to the clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC patients. The diagnostic and prognostic significance of the biomarkers were evaluated by using receiver operating curve (ROC), Kaplan-Meier curve, and log-rank analyses and the Cox proportional hazard model, respectively. Serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 levels were significantly higher in the NSCLC patients than that in the controls (23.5 ± 6.57 vs. 13.8 ± 2.49 and 7.11 ± 2.02 vs. 5.18 ± 1.26, respectively). NSCLC patients at later stage cancer showed significantly higher levels of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 than those at the early stages (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high serum thioredoxin level was an independent risk factor for lymph nodal metastases and distant metastases (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI 1.26-3.41 and OR = 3.68, 95 % CI 2.16-5.33, respectively). In addition, an increase in the serum DJ-1 level was also identified as an independent risk factor for nodal metastases (OR = 1.37, 95 % CI 1.11-3.04). For predicting the development of NSCLC, ROC/area under the curve (AUC) analysis for thioredoxin indicated an AUC of 0.80 (sensitivity 0.62, specificity 0.92), and ROC/AUC analysis for DJ-1 showed an AUC of 0.78 (sensitivity 0.66, specificity 0.89). NSCLC patients with high serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 levels had lower survival rates than those with low levels, and multivariate analyses for overall survival revealed that high serum thioredoxin levels served as an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC (HR = 2.07, 95 % CI 1.19-3.48). Serum levels of thioredoxin and DJ-1 were significantly higher in NSCLC patients; therefore, these may be utilized as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC. ",

Despite a dramatic reduction in asbestos use worldwide, asbestos-induced lung diseases remain a substantial health concern primarily because of the vast amounts of fibers that have been mined, processed, and used during the 20th century combined with the long latency period of up to 40 years between exposure and disease presentation. This review summarizes the important new epidemiologic and pathogenic information that has emerged over the past several years. Whereas the development of asbestosis is directly associated with the magnitude and duration of asbestos exposure, the development of a malignant clone of cells can occur in the setting of low-level asbestos exposure. Emphasis is placed on the recent epidemiologic investigations that explore the malignancy risk that occurs from nonoccupational, environmental asbestos exposure. Accumulating studies are shedding light on novel mechanistic pathways by which asbestos damages the lung. Attention is focused on the importance of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury and repair, the role of iron-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis by the p53- and mitochondria-regulated death pathways. Furthermore, recent evidence underscores crucial roles for specific cellular signaling pathways that regulate the production of cytokines and growth factors. An evolving role for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is also reviewed. The translational significance of these studies is evident in providing the molecular basis for developing novel therapeutic strategies for asbestos-related lung diseases and, importantly, other pulmonary diseases, such as interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer.",

We examined potential regulators of ROS production and discovered that hyperoxia treatment of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells induced recruitment of the vesicular regulator, dynamin 2, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, and the NADPH oxidase subunit, p47(phox), to caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEMs). Silencing caveolin-1 (which blocks CEM formation) and/or c-Abl expression with small interference RNA inhibited hyperoxia-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and association of dynamin 2 with p47(phox) and ROS production. In addition, treatment of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with dynamin 2 small interfering RNA or the dynamin GTPase inhibitor, Dynasore, attenuated hyperoxia-mediated ROS production and p47(phox) recruitment to CEMs. Using purified recombinant proteins, we observed that c-Abl tyrosine-phosphorylated dynamin 2, and this phosphorylation increased p47(phox)/dynamin 2 association (change in the dissociation constant (K(d)) from 85.8 to 6.9 nm). Furthermore, exposure of mice to hyperoxia increased ROS production, c-Abl activation, dynamin 2 association with p47(phox), and pulmonary leak, events that were attenuated in the caveolin-1 knock-out mouse confirming a role for CEMs in ROS generation.

Herceptin is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of ErbB2. In this study, we aimed to block ErbB2 signaling with Herceptin and assess cytotoxicity and effects on apoptosis, oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), and Survivin expression in Calu-3 cell line. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were used to assess cell viability as a marker of proliferation. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and caspase 3/7 activity were measured as the markers of apoptosis. The relative expressions of NF-kB-p50 and Survivin mRNAs were evaluated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity governs multi-drug resistance (MDR) development in different cancer cell types. Identification of anti-cancer agents with the potential to kill cancer cells and at the same time inhibit MDR is important to intensify the search for novel therapeutic approaches. We examined the effects of sulfinosine (SF), a quite unexplored purine nucleoside analog, in MDR (P-gp over-expressing) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and glioblastoma cell lines (NCI-H460/R and U87-TxR, respectively). SF showed the same efficacy against MDR cancer cell lines and their sensitive counterparts. However, it was non-toxic for normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT). SF induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death and autophagy in MDR cancer cells. After SF application, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated and glutathione (GSH) concentration was decreased. The expression of key enzyme for GSH synthesis, gamma Glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (γGCS) was decreased as well as the expression of gst-π mRNA. Consequently, SF significantly decreased the expression of hif-1α, mdr1 and vegf mRNAs even in hypoxic conditions. SF caused the inhibition of P-gp (coded by mdr1) expression and activity. The accumulation of standard chemotherapeutic agent--doxorubicin (DOX) was induced by SF in concentration- and time-dependent manner. The best effect of SF was obtained after 72 h when it attained the effect of known P-gp inhibitors (Dex-verapamil and tariquidar). Accordingly, SF sensitized the resistant cancer cells to DOX in subsequent treatment. Furthermore, SF decreased the experssion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on mRNA and protein level and modulated its secretion. In conclusion, the effects on P-gp (implicated in pharmacokinetics and MDR), GSH (implicated in detoxification) and VEGF (implicated in tumor-angiogenesis and progression) qualify SF as multi-potent anti-cancer agent, which use must be considered, in particular for resistant malignancies.",

Notably, RHL statistically significantly suppressed the growth of human glioma U87 xenografts in BALB/c nude mice. In vitro, there was a significant reduction in cell proliferation after treatment with RHL in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

The results demonstrated that RHL is highly effective against the growth of human glioma U87 xenografts in BALB/c nude mice.

IOA was found to induce the arrest of G2-M phase, induce apoptosis, increase sub-G1, and inhibit the growth of these cells. Further investigation revealed that IOA's blockade of the cell cycle was associated with increased levels of p21/WAF1, p27 (kip1), and p53. In addition, IOA triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratios, resulting in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. We also found the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to be a critical mediator in IOA-induced inhibition of A549 cell growth. In antioxidant and NO inhibitor studies, we found that by pretreating A549 cells with either N-acetylcystenine (NAC), catalase, mannitol, dexamethasone, trolox, or L-NAME we could significantly decrease IOA production of ROS. Moreover, using NAC to block ROS, we could significantly suppress IOA-induced antiproliferation, antimigration, and anti-invasion. Finally, we found that IOA inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these results suggest that IOA has anticancer effects on A549 cells.",

However, the combined impact of these insults is poorly understood. We recently reported that preexposure to hyperoxia for 12 h, followed by ventilation with large tidal volumes, induced significant lung injury and epithelial cell apoptosis compared with either stimulus alone (Makena et al. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 299: L711-L719, 2010). The upstream mechanisms of this lung injury and apoptosis have not been clearly elucidated. We hypothesized that lung injury in this model was dependent on oxidative signaling via the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNK). We, therefore, evaluated lung injury and apoptosis in the presence of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in both mouse and cell culture models, and we provide evidence that NAC significantly inhibited lung injury and apoptosis by reducing the production of ROS, activation of JNK, and apoptosis. To confirm JNK involvement in apoptosis, cells treated with a specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, and subjected to preexposure to hyperoxia, followed by mechanical stretch, exhibited significantly reduced evidence of apoptosis. In conclusion, lung injury and apoptosis caused by preexposure to hyperoxia, followed by high tidal volume mechanical ventilation, induces ROS-mediated activation of JNK and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. NAC protects lung injury and apoptosis by inhibiting ROS-mediated activation of JNK and downstream proapoptotic signaling.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate mechanistic insight into cellular perturbations that accompany acquired gefitinib resistance in lung cancer cells. Several lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) cell lines were screened to characterize epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and mutation profile. To circumvent intrinsic variations between cell lines with respect to response to drug treatments, we generated gefitinib-resistant H1650 clone by long-term, chronic culture under gefitinib selection of parental cell line. Isogenic cells were analyzed by microarray, Western blot, flow cytometry, and confocal and transmission electron microscope. We observed that although chronic gefitinib treatment provided effective action against its primary target (aberrant EGFR activity), secondary effects resulted in increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Gefitinib-mediated ROS correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as striking perturbation of mitochondrial morphology and function. However, gefitinib treatment in the presence of ROS scavenger provided a partial rescue of mitochondrial aberrations. Furthermore, withdrawal of gefitinib from previously resistant clones correlated with normalized expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes. These findings demonstrate that chronic gefitinib treatment promotes ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction in lung cancer cells. Antioxidants may alleviate ROS-mediated resistance. ",

However, little is known regarding the effect of moscatilin on cancer cell migration and invasion. The present study demonstrates that nontoxic concentrations of moscatilin were able to inhibit human nonsmall cell lung cancer H23 cell migration and invasion. The inhibitory effect of moscatilin was associated with an attenuation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), in which hydroxyl radical (OH(∙)) was identified as a dominant species in the suppression of filopodia formation. Western blot analysis also revealed that moscatilin downregulated activated focal adhesion kinase (phosphorylated FAK, Tyr 397) and activated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (phosphorylated Akt, Ser 473), whereas their parental counterparts were not detectable changed.

Cell killing by ionizing radiation is mediated primarily through the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-driven oxidative stress. Prx1, a peroxiredoxin family member, was shown to be frequently elevated in lung cancer cells and tissues. Although the antioxidant function of Prx1 is expected to affect the radiotherapy response of lung cancer, the physiologic significance of its peroxidase activity in irradiated cells is unclear because the catalytic Cys52 is easily inactivated by ROS due to its overoxidation to sulfinic or sulfonic acid. In this study, we investigated the role of Prx1 in radiation sensitivity of human lung cancer cells, with special emphasis on the redox status of the catalytic Cys52. We found that overexpression of Prx1 enhances the clonogenic survival of irradiated cells and suppresses ionizing radiation-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and apoptosis. The peroxidase activity of Prx1, however, is not essential for inhibiting JNK activation. The latter effect is mediated through its association with the glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi)-JNK complex, thereby preventing JNK release from the complex. Reduced JNK activation is observed when the peroxidase activity of Prx1 is compromised by Cys52 overoxidation or in the presence of the Cys52 to Ser52 mutant (Prx1C52S) lacking peroxidase activity. We show that both Prx1 and Prx1C52S interact with the GSTpi-JNK complex and suppress the release of JNK from the complex.

Different concentrations of curcumin were used for different durations in NCI-H460 cells and the subsequent changes in the cell morphology, viability, cell cycle, mRNA and protein expressions were determined. Curcumin induced apoptotic morphologic changes in NCI-H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After curcumin treatment, BAX and BAD were up-regulated, BCL-2, BCL-X(L) and XIAP were down-regulated. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular Ca(2+) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were increased in NCI-H460 cells after exposure to curcumin.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mercury, one of the widespread pollutants in the world, induces oxidative stress and dysfunction in many cell types. Alveolar type II epithelial cells are known to be vulnerable to oxidative stress. Alveolar type II epithelial cells produce and secrete surfactants to maintain morphological organization, biophysical functions, biochemical composition, and immunity in lung tissues. However, the precise action and mechanism of mercury on alveolar type II epithelial cell damage remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the effect and possible mechanism of methylmercury chloride (MeHgCl) on the human lung invasive carcinoma cell line (Cl1-0) and mouse lung tissue. Cl1-0 cells were exposed to MeHgCl (2.5-10 microM) for 24-72 h. The results showed a decrease in cell viability and an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level and ROS production at 72 h after MeHgCl exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase-3 activity, sub-G1 contents and annexin-V binding were dramatically enhanced in Cl1-0 cells treated with MeHgCl. MeHgCl could also activate Bax, release cytochrome c, and cleave poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP), and decrease surfactant proteins mRNA levels. Moreover, in vivo study showed that mercury contents of blood and lung tissues were significantly increased after MeHgCl treatment in mice. The MDA levels in plasma and lung tissues were also dramatically raised after MeHgCl treatment. Lung tissue sections of MeHgCl-treated mice showed pathological fibrosis as compared with vehicle control. The mRNA levels of proteins in apoptotic signaling, including p53, mdm-2, Bax, Bad, and caspase-3 were increased in mice after exposure to MeHgCl. In addition, the mRNA levels of surfactant proteins (SPs), namely, SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D (alveolar epithelial cell functional markers) were significantly decreased. These results suggest that MeHgCl activates an oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial cell death in alveolar epithelial cells.",

ROS can cause oxidative deoxyribonucleic acid modification, such as 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). A human homologue of the MutT protein (hMTH1) prevents this modification. Mitochondria are the most important cellular source of ROS and may be susceptible to oxidative damage. The purpose of this study is to investigate oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in lung epithelial cells from idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs). The authors analysed 8-OHdG, hMTH1, and mitochondrial proteins on lung specimens from 13 patients with IlPs consisted of eight patients with usual interstitial pneumonia and five patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for 8-OHdG and hMTH1 was significantly increased in the lung epithelial cells from patients with IIPs compared with controls. The expression of hMTH1 was localised in the nuclear and cytoplasmic, but not the mitochondrial, fraction of lung homogenates. Immunoreactivity for mitochondrial protein and cytochrome c oxidase complex subunit IV was increased in the lung epithelial cells from patients with IIPs compared with controls. The current study concludes that oxidative stress may participate in epithelial cell damage in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, and that increased mitochondrial mass may associate with increased reactive oxygen species production in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.",

In examining the role and function of ALKBH8 in human bladder cancer development in vitro, we found that silencing of ALKBH8 through small interfering RNA transfection reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via down-regulation of NAD(P)H oxidase-1 (NOX-1) and induced apoptosis through subsequent activation of c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. However, we also found that JNK and p38 activation resulted in phosphorylation of H2AX (gammaH2AX), a variant of mammalian histone H2A, which contributes to the apoptosis induced by silencing ALKBH8 and NOX-1. Silencing of ALKBH8 significantly suppressed invasion, angiogenesis, and growth of bladder cancers in vivo as assessed both in the chorioallantoic membrane assay and in an orthotopic mouse model using green fluorescent protein-labeled KU7 human urothelial carcinoma cells. Immunohistochemical examination showed high expression of ALKBH8 and NOX-1 proteins in high-grade, superficially and deeply invasive carcinomas (pT(1) and >pT(2)) as well as in carcinoma in situ, but not in low-grade and noninvasive phenotypes (pT(a)). These findings indicate an essential role for ALKBH8 in urothelial carcinoma cell survival mediated by NOX-1-dependent ROS signals, further suggesting new therapeutic strategies in human bladder cancer by inducing JNK/p38/gammaH2AX-mediated cell death by silencing of ALKBH8.",

ATO caused a dose-dependant decrease of viability of A549 cells with an IC50 of more than 50 microM. Low doses of ATO or BSO (1 approximately 10 microM) alone did not induce cell death. However, combined treatment depleted GSH content and induced apoptosis, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and cell cycle arrest in G2. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased or decreased depending on the concentration of ATO. In addition, BSO generally increased ROS in ATO-treated A549 cells. ROS levels were at least in part related to apoptosis in cells treated with ATO and/or BSO.

We report here that Cav-1 plays a key role as a negative regulator of anoikis through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism in human lung carcinoma H460 cells. During cell detachment, Cav-1 is downregulated, whereas ROS generation is upregulated. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical are two key ROS produced by cells during detachment. Treatment of the cells with hydrogen peroxide scavengers, catalase and N-acetylcysteine, promoted Cav-1 downregulation and anoikis during cell detachment, indicating that produced hydrogen peroxide plays a primary role in preventing anoikis by stabilizing Cav-1 protein. Catalase and N-acetylcysteine promoted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Cav-1, which is a major pathway of its downregulation during cell anoikis. Furthermore, addition of hydrogen peroxide exogenously to the cells inhibited Cav-1 downregulation by preventing the formation of Cav-1-ubiquitin complex, supporting the inhibitory role of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in Cav-1 degradation during cell detachment.

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the expression of miR-99a and clinical stage or metastasis in 90 matched lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent non-tumor lung tissues. Downregulation of miR-99a was significantly associated with advanced stage and tumor metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma patients, and it was found to be a poor prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, functional experiments found that overexpression of miR-99a inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma A549 and Calu3 cells in vitro. We then identified NOX4 as a target gene of miR-99a and NOX4 mediated the inhibition of invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells by miR-99a. By targeting NOX4-mediated ROS production, miR-99a regulated the invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR-99a significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining analysis of the mouse tumor tissues revealed that NOX4 levels were downregulated in the miR-99a treatment group, confirming the in vitro data of NOX4 as a direct target gene of miR-99a.

However, the precise mechanism of its action remains ambiguous. In this study, we elucidated the molecular basis for TL-induced cell death in context to p53 status. Cell death was attributed to dysfunction of mitochondrial bioenergetics in p53-deficient cells, which was characterized by decreased mitochondrial respiration, steady-state ATP level and membrane potential, but augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS production resulted in oxidative stress in TL-treated cells. This was exhibited by elevated nuclear levels of a redox-sensitive transcriptional factor, NF-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2), along with diminished cellular glutathione (GSH) content. We further demonstrated that in the absence of p53, TL blunted the expression of mitochondrial SIRT3 triggering increased acetylation of NDUAF9 and succinate dehydrogenase, components of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain (ETC). TL-mediated hyperacetylation of complexes I and II proteins and these complexes displayed decreased enzymatic activities. We also provide the evidence that P53 regulate steady-state level of SIRT3 through Proteasome-Pathway. Finally, forced overexpression of Sirt3, but not deacetylase-deficient mutant of Sirt3 (H243Y), restored the deleterious effect of TL on p53-deficient cells by rescuing mitochondrial bioenergetics. On contrary, Sirt3 deficiency in the background of wild-type p53 triggered TL-induced mitochondrial impairment that echoed TL effect in p53-deficeint cells. These findings illustrate a novel mechanism by which TL exerts its potent effects on mitochondrial function and ultimately the viability of NSCLC tumor. ",

In this review, we will highlight the key driver oncogenic gene mutations and fusions identified in lung cancer. The review will summarize and report the available demographic and clinicopathological data as well as molecular details behind various lung cancer gene alterations in the context of race. We hope to shed some light into the disparities in the incidence of various genetic mutations among lung cancer patients of different racial backgrounds. As molecularly targeted therapy continues to advance in lung cancer, racial differences in specific genetic/genomic alterations can have an important impact in the choices of therapeutics and in our understanding of the drug sensitivity/resistance profile. The most relevant genes in lung cancer described in this review include the following: EGFR, KRAS, MET, LKB1, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, RET, and ROS1. Commonly identified genetic/genomic alterations such as missense or nonsense mutations, small insertions or deletions, alternative splicing, and chromosomal fusion rearrangements were discussed. Relevance in current targeted therapeutic drugs was mentioned when appropriate. We also highlighted various targeted therapeutics that are currently under clinical development, such as the MET inhibitors and antibodies. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the landscape of genomic alterations in lung cancer is expected to be much transformed and detailed in upcoming years.

Effect of the selected compound to bind double stranded DNA (ds DNA) was examined by testing its influence on thermal stability of calf thymus DNA while its influence on cell cycle was determined by flow cytometric analysis. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined by addition of specific substrate 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA).;Parent triazoles were largely inactive, while some of the triazolium salts were highly cytotoxic for HeLa cells. Triazolium salts exhibited high cell-type dependent cytotoxicity against different tumour cells. Selected compound (4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-(2-picolyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazolium hexafluorophosphate(V) (2b) was significantly more cytotoxic against tumour cells than to normal cells, with very high therapeutic index 7.69 for large cell lung carcinoma H460 cells. Additionally, this compound was similarly cytotoxic against parent laryngeal carcinoma HEp-2 cells and their drug resistant 7T subline, suggesting the potential of this compound in treatment of drug resistant cancers. Compound 2b arrested cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It did not bind ds DNA, but induced ROS in treated cells, which further triggered cell death.;Our results suggest that the 'click' triazolium salts are worthy of further investigation as anti-cancer agents.",

Live X-ray fluoroscopy enabled quantification of air space fluid content of C57BL/6J mouse lungs challenged by intratracheal (IT) instillation of saline; results were confirmed by using conventional lung wet-to-dry weight ratios and Evans blue as measures of pulmonary edema. Visualization and quantification of ROS produced in lungs was performed in mice that had been administered a redox-sensitive dye, hydro-Cy7, by IT instillation. We found that inhibition of NADPH oxidase with a Rac-1 inhibitor, NSC23766, resulted in alveolar flooding, which correlated with a decrease in lung ROS production in vivo. Consistent with a role for Nox2 in alveolar fluid balance, Nox2(-/-) mice showed increased retention of air space fluid compared with wild-type controls. Interestingly, fluoroscopic analysis of C57BL/6J lungs IT instilled with LPS showed an acute stimulation of lung fluid clearance and ROS production in vivo that was abrogated by the ROS scavenger tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO). Acute application of LPS increased the activity of 20 pS nonselective ENaC channels in rat type 1 cells; the average number of channel and single-channel open probability (NPo) increased from 0.14 ± 0.04 to 0.62 ± 0.23. Application of TEMPO to the same cell-attached recording caused an immediate significant decrease in ENaC NPo to 0.04 ± 0.03. These data demonstrate that, in vivo, ROS has the capacity to stimulate lung fluid clearance by increasing ENaC activity.",

Additional oncogene aberrations, including RET, ROS1, and NRG1 fusions, skipping of exon 14 of MET, and mutations in BRAF, HER2, NF1, and MEK1, were recently added to the list of such \"druggable\" driver oncogene aberrations, and their responses to targeted therapies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. However, approximately 30% and 50% of LADCs in patients in Japan and Europe/USA, respectively, lack the driver oncogene aberrations listed above. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies, such as those that exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells with non-oncogene aberrations, are urgently required.

Cancerous cells as well as some types of normal cells are often resistant to cell death induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines through death receptors. This potentially allows cancer cells to evade the control from the immune system and to proceed toward a more malignant stage, although the mechanisms of this evasion are not well established. We have recently identified the stress-responsive Sestrin2 protein as a critical regulator of cell viability under stress conditions. Sestrin2 is a member of a small family of antioxidant proteins and inhibitors of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase. Down-regulation of Sestrin1/2 leads to genetic instability and accelerates the growth of lung adenocarcinoma xenografts. Here we addressed the potential role of Sestrin2 in regulation of cell death induced by TNFR1 and related Fas and TRAIL receptors in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We found that Sestrin2 silencing strongly inhibits cytokine-induced cell death through a mechanism independent of ROS and mTORC1 regulation. We determined that the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) plays a critical role in the control of cytokine-induced cell death by Sestrin2. Thus our study defines a new, previously unrecognized role of Sestrin2 in the regulation of apoptosis. ",

Overexpression of FLAG-tagged wild type MLCK in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells enhanced interaction and co-localization between cortactin and p47(phox) at the cell periphery and ROS production, whereas abrogation of MLCK using specific siRNA significantly inhibited the above. Furthermore, HO stimulated phosphorylation of MLC and recruitment of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated cortactin, MLC, Src, and p47(phox) to caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEM), whereas silencing nmMLCK with siRNA blocked recruitment of these components to CEM and ROS generation. Exposure of nmMLCK(-/-) null mice to HO (72 h) reduced ROS production, lung inflammation, and pulmonary leak compared with control mice.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a potent pleiotropic, proinflammatory cytokine produced by many cells in response to injury and inflammation. Here, we show that TNF-alpha exposure results in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), with a concomitant increase in the production of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine, a marker for oxidative DNA damage, in human lung bronchial epithelial cells. The source of the ROS in TNF-alpha-treated cells was determined by both pharmacologic and small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategies to be spermine oxidase (SMO/PAOh1). SMO/PAOh1 oxidizes spermine into spermidine, 3-aminopropanal, and H(2)O(2). Inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced SMO/PAOh1 activity with MDL 72,527 or with a targeted siRNA prevented ROS production and oxidative DNA damage. Further, similar induction in SMO/PAOh1 is observed with treatment of another inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6. The data are consistent with a model that directly links inflammation and DNA damage through the production of H(2)O(2) by SMO/PAOh1. Further, these results suggest a common mechanism by which inflammation from multiple sources can lead to the mutagenic changes necessary for the development and progression of epithelial cancers.",

In a nested case-control study, gDNA from 105 Caucasian primary non-small cell lung cancer cases and 105 matched controls was screened for 6 possible new polymorphic sites in the human OGG1 gene, detected previously mainly in tumour tissue. The previously described Ser(326)Cys polymorphism was found to be common (allele frequency 0.22) in Caucasians. However, no major difference in Ser(326)Cys genotype distribution could be detected between cases and controls. Two 5;-end polymorphisms previously found in Japanese as well as Arg(131)Gln could not be detected in this population. An Ala(85)Ser polymorphism was found in 2 controls, whereas Arg(46)Gln was detected in only 1 case. As the hOGG1 gene is mapped (3p26.2) to a region frequently lost in primary lung tumours, the frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was investigated. Forty-three percent of the studied lung tumours exhibited loss of one of the hOGG1 alleles. The wt Ser(326) allele was not predominantly lost in our sample set, which suggests a minor role of this polymorphism in tumourgenesis. Our results show that LOH at the hOGG1 gene locus is a very common occurrence in lung tumourgenesis, possibly leading to increased mutational damage due to ROS in smokers. However, the hOGG1 polymorphisms studied are probably not major contributors to individual lung cancer susceptibility in Caucasians.",

Applying ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells. Analysis of protein expression profiles after citreoviridin treatment suggested this compound induced the unfolded protein response (UPR) associated with phosphorylation the translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), triggering cell growth inhibition. Citreoviridin-enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation could be reversed by siRNA-mediated attenuation of the UPR kinase PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) combined with treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, establishing that reactive oxygen species (ROS) boost UPR after citreoviridin treatment. Thus, a coordinate elevation of UPR and ROS initiates a positive feedback loop that convergently blocks cell proliferation.

Due to its unique structure providing enormous surface area to outside ambient air, it is vulnerable to numerous pathogens, pollutants, oxidants, gases, and toxicants that are inhaled continuously from air, which makes the lung susceptible to varying degrees of oxidative injury. To combat these unrelenting physical, chemical, and biological insults, the respiratory epithelium is covered with a thin layer of lining fluid containing several antioxidants and surfactants. Inhaled toxic agents stimulate the generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), which in turn provoke inflammatory responses resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These subsequently stimulate the influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes into the lung so as to combat the invading pathogens or toxic agents. In addition to the beneficial effects, persistent inhalation of the invading pathogens or toxic agents may result in overwhelming production of ROS/RNS, producing chronic inflammation and lung injury. During inflammation, enhanced ROS/RNS production may induce recurring DNA damage, inhibition of apoptosis, and activation of proto-oncogenes by initiating signal transduction pathways. Therefore, it is conceivable that chronic inflammation-induced production of ROS/RNS in the lung may predispose individuals to lung cancer.

The length of response is variable, and we thus sought to identify which clinicopathologic characteristics are associated with long-term disease control with pemetrexed.;Patients with metastatic NSCLC received pemetrexed (with or without bevacizumab) for 12 months or longer, either as maintenance treatment after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy or as subsequent treatment. Clinical and pathologic characteristics were collected.;Of a total of 196 patients who received pemetrexed starting in 2007, 25 patients were identified who received pemetrexed for over 1 year. Of these, 15 patients received pemetrexed with or without bevacizumab as maintenance treatment and 10 patients received pemetrexed as subsequent treatment. Fifteen (60%) of 25 patients had an oncogenic driver mutation as follows: 5 (20%) had ROS1 gene rearrangements, 4 (16%) had ALK gene rearrangements, 3 (12%) had KRAS mutations, 2 (8%) had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, and 1 (4%) had an NRAS mutation. The median overall survival was 42.2 months (95% confidence interval, 37.4-61.3) and median progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% confidence interval, 15.1-29.1). Patients with an oncogenic driver mutation had significantly better progression-free survival (P = .006) and overall survival (P = .001).;Among patients with NSCLC who received pemetrexed for an extended time, those with ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements were proportionally overrepresented compared with that anticipated in a general nonsquamous NSCLC population, and patients with oncogenic driver mutations had improved outcomes.",

With its chaperone and PPIase activities, CypA contributes to the maintenance of correct conformation of nascent or denatured proteins and also provides protection against environmental insults. Also, its expression is induced in response to a wide variety of stressors including cancer. Upregulation of CypA in small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma has been reported. In some cancers a correlation between CypA overexpression and malignant transformation has been established. While molecular partners of CypA that promote cancer development are yet to be discovered, various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the cytoprotective functions of CypA during cancer development. CypA may promote the survival of cells under the stressful condition of cancer. CypA may well be essential for maintaining the conformation of oncogenic proteins, signalling proteins for cell proliferation, antiapoptotic components, transcription factors, or cell motility regulatory proteins. Antioxidant effects of CypA, which have been suggested by some researchers, may also become critical to reactive oxygen species (ROS) creating an oncogenetic environment. Developing new CypA inhibitors for therapeutics has been surmised from the cytoprotective functions of CypA and its overexpression in many cancer types. Therefore, CypA can be further investigated as a useful tool for early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of human cancers.",

Growth of primary tumor and number and volume of lung metastases were registered. Lactate and pyruvate content was determined by enzymatic methods using lactate dehydrogenase. Electron paramagnetic resonance was used for analyzing the functional state of the components of mitochondrial respiratory chain. Engulfing activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in tumor-associated CD14(+) cells was analyzed by flow cytometer with the use of FITC-labeled staphylococcus, and by spectrofluorometry with the use of 2.7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, respectively.;DCA administered as a single agent did not affect primary tumor growth but decreased the number and volume of lung metastases by 60% (p < 0.05) and 90% (p < 0.05), respectively. In mice treated with 2DG only, primary tumor volume as well as the number and volume of lung metastases were not affected. Combination treatment with DCA and 2DG resulted in the decrease of primary tumor volume, the number and volumes of lung metastases by 70; 46, and 90%, respectively (p < 0.05).

Angiogenesis is considered a fundamental requirement for tumorigenesis, but the mechanisms underlying the tumor angiogenesis induced by cadmium are poorly understood. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated the angiogenic mechanisms of cadmium in human bronchial epithelial cells and tumor formation. Our results demonstrated that cadmium (CdCl(2)) activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and AKT signaling and elevated the expression of a key downstream proangiogenic molecule hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in immortalized human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Cadmium also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which could be inhibited by ROS scavengers, catalase and diphenyleneiodonium chloride. Inhibition of ROS generation also attenuated ERK, AKT, p70S6K1 activation, and HIF-1α expression. Similar results were obtained in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, showing that cadmium induced HIF-1 expression via ROS/ERK/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, cadmium induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression and transcriptional activation through ROS, ERK, and AKT pathways. Finally, cadmium transformed human bronchial epithelial cells in culture; the transformed cells induced tube formation in vitro, angiogenesis on chicken chorioallantoic membrane, and formed tumors in nude mice. Taken together, the results of this study provide explanation for the role and molecular mechanisms of cadmium in promoting angiogenesis in lung epithelial cells and malignant transformation and will be helpful for improved occupational protection, prevention, as well as chemotherapy of human lung cancers caused by heavy metal cadmium.",

In comparison with human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, the natural PTEN loss in another human lung adenocarcinoma line, PC14PE6/AS2 cells, presents reduced responsiveness in IFN-γ-induced IFN regulatory factor 1 activation and CD54 expression. Artificially silencing PTEN expression in A549 cells also caused cells to be unresponsive to IFN-γ without affecting IFN-γ receptor expression. IFN-γ-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were demonstrated in A549 cells but were defective in PC14PE6/AS2 cells and in PTEN-deficient A549 cells. Aberrant activation of SHP2 by ROS was specifically shown in PC14PE6/AS2 cells and PTEN-deficient A549 cells. Inhibiting ROS and SHP2 rescued cellular responses to IFN-γ-induced cytotoxicity and inhibition of cell proliferation in PC14PE6/AS2 cells.

Given that the common and \"non-pathological\" mtDNA variations determine differences in oxidative phosphorylation performance and ROS production, an important determinant of lung cancer risk, we hypothesize that the mtDNA variations may play roles in lung cancer risk. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study to compare the frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups and an 822 bp mtDNA deletion between 422 lung cancer patients and 504 controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that haplogroups D and F were related to individual lung cancer resistance (OR = 0.465, 95%CI = 0.329-0.656, p<0.001; and OR = 0.622, 95%CI = 0.425-0.909, p = 0.014, respectively), while haplogroups G and M7 might be risk factors for lung cancer (OR = 3.924, 95%CI = 1.757-6.689, p<0.001; and OR = 2.037, 95%CI = 1.253-3.312, p = 0.004, respectively). Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that cigarette smoking was a risk factor for the 822 bp mtDNA deletion.

Our results showed that intranasal exposure of mice to acrolein increased CD11c(+)F4/80(high) macrophages in the lungs and increased ROS formation via induction of NF-κB signaling. Treatment with acrolein activated macrophages and led to their increased production of ROS and expression of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines. In in vitro studies, acrolein treatment of bone marrow-derived GM-CSF-dependent immature macrophages (GM-IMs), activated the cells and led to their increased production of ROS and expression of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acrolein treatment of macrophages induced apoptosis of lung epithelial cells. Inclusion of an inhibitor of ROS formation markedly decreased acrolein-mediated macrophage activation and reduced the extent of epithelial cell death.

It is a naphthoquinone compound with anti-atherosclerosis, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, contraceptive, cardiotonic, immunosuppressive, and neuroprotective activities. However, the mechanisms of plumbagin's activities are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of plumbagin on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells as well as LLC lung cancer cells, SiHa cervical carcinoma cells. Plumbagin significantly decreased HepG2 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, treatment with plumbagin significantly increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3/7 activity. Using the similarity ensemble approach (SEA)-a state-of-the-art cheminformatic technique-we identified two previously unknown cellular targets of plumbagin: thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione reductase (GR). This was then confirmed using protein- and cell-based assays. We found that plumbagin was directly reduced by TrxR, and that this reduction was inhibited by the TrxR inhibitor, sodium aurothiomalate (ATM). Plumbagin also decreased the activity of GR. Plumbagin, and the GR inhibitor sodium arsenite all increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and this increase was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in HepG2 cells. Plumbagin increased TrxR-1 and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression and pretreatment with NAC significantly attenuated the plumbagin-induced increase of TrxR-1 and HO-1 expression in HepG2 cells, LLC cells and SiHa cells. Pretreatment with NAC significantly prevented the plumbagin-induced decrease in cell viability in these cell types. In conclusion, plumbagin exerted its anticancer effect by directly interacting with TrxR and GR, and thus increasing intracellular ROS levels. ",

In the present study, we demonstrated that cancer cells transiently upregulated HIF-1 activity during their metastatic colonization after extravasation in the lungs in hypoxia-independent and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manners. Transient activation induced the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A and phosphorylation of the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which indicated the reprogramming of glucose metabolic pathways from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation. The administration of the HIF-1 inhibitor, YC-1, inhibited this reprogramming, increased intratumoral ROS levels, and eventually suppressed the formation of metastatic lung tumors. These results indicate that HIF-1-mediated metabolic reprogramming is responsible for the survival of metastatic cancers during their colonization in lungs by reducing cytotoxic ROS levels; therefore, its blockade by HIF-1-inhibitors is a rational strategy to prevent tumor metastasis.

Earlier we observed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-deficient mice are more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than AhR-sufficient mice, and this phenomenon was associated with a lack of expression of cytochrome P450 1A enzymes. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor used in humans with gastric acid-related disorders, activates AhR in hepatocytes in vitro. However, the effects of omeprazole on AhR activation in the lungs and its impact on hyperoxia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inflammation are unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that omeprazole attenuates hyperoxia-induced cytotoxicity, ROS generation, and expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in human lung-derived H441 cells via AhR activation. Experimental groups included cells transfected with AhR small interfering RNA (siRNA). Hyperoxia resulted in significant increases in cytotoxicity, ROS generation, and MCP-1 production, which were significantly attenuated with the functional activation of AhR by omeprazole. The protective effects of omeprazole on cytotoxicity, ROS production, and MCP-1 production were lost in H441 cells whose AhR gene was silenced by AhR siRNA.

Overexpression of oncogene c-Myc is one of the most frequently encountered events present in ovarian carcinoma.

Our objective was to evaluate the potential effects of small-molecule c-Myc inhibitor, 10058-F4, on ovarian carcinoma cells and the underlying mechanisms by which 10058-F4 exerts its actions. Using MTT assay, colony formation, flow cytometry and Annexin V FITC assays, we found that 10058-F4 significantly inhibited cell proliferation of both SKOV3 and Hey ovarian cancer cells in a dose dependent manner through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle G1 arrest. Treatment with 10058-F4 reduced cellular ATP production and ROS levels in SKOV3 and Hey cells. Consistently, primary cultures of ovarian cancer treated with 10058-F4 showed induction of caspase-3 activity and inhibition of cell proliferation in 15 of 18 cases. The response to 10058-F4 was independent the level of c-Myc protein over-expression in primary cultures of ovarian carcinoma.

These neoplasms frequently exhibit marked confluent necrosis, in which hypoxia levels are extremely high, causing low responsiveness to chemotherapy and conferring basic resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-mediated immune escape may be an underlying source of resistance and a suitable target for specific therapy, but its role in PPCs is unclear.;In total, 122 PPCs were investigated. Paraffin-embedded tumour sections were stained with PD-L1 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) antibodies. Overexpression was denoted by moderate-to-strong PD-L1 membrane staining in ≥5% of tumour cells and HIF-1α nuclear staining in ≥10% of tumour cells. The presence of driver mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), telomerase reverse harscriptase gene (TERT), phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic alpha (PIK3CA), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and ROS1 (ROS1 proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase) genes were examined.;The overall frequencies of PD-L1 and HIF-1α overexpression and EGFR mutation were 70.5, 75.4, and 22.1%, respectively. High PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with that of HIF-1α (p < 0.001) and tumour necrosis (p < 0.001). HIF-1α expression was associated with EGFR mutation (p = 0.015). Advanced stage and high PD-L1 expression were two independent risks for poor overall survival.;High PD-L1 and HIF-1α co-expression was observed in PPCs compared with their expression in conventional non-small-cell lung carcinoma. The aggressive behaviour of PPC could be partially related to PD-L1-mediated immune escape and intratumoural hypoxia. High PD-L1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and may provide a rationale for the use of targeted immunotherapy in this subtype of high-grade PPC.",

Numerous studies have shown that CTD induced cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. However, there is no report to demonstrate that CTD induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the effect of CTD on the cell death via the induction of apoptosis in H460 human lung cancer cells. Flow cytometry assay was used for examining the percentage of cell viability, sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca²⁺ productions and the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm). Annexin V/PI staining and DNA gel electrophoresis were also used for examining cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to examine the changes of apoptosis associated protein expression and confocal microscopy for examining the translocation apoptosis associated protein. Results indicated that CTD significantly induced cell morphological changes and decreased the percentage of viable H460 cells. CTD induced apoptosis based on the occurrence of sub-G1 phase and DNA fragmentation. We found that CTD increased gene expression (mRNA) of caspase-3 and -8. Moreover, CTD increased ROS and Ca2+ production and decreased the levels of ∆Ψm. Western blot analysis results showed that CTD increased the expression of cleavage caspase-3 and -8, cytochrome c, Bax and AIF but inhibited the levels of Bcl-xL. CTD promoted ER stress associated protein expression such as GRP78, IRE1α, IRE1β, ATF6α and caspase-4 and it also promoted the expression of calpain 2 and XBP-1, but inhibited calpain 1 that is associated with apoptosis pathways. Based on those observations, we suggest that CTD may be used as a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of lung cancer in the future.",

Moreover, we found that rosline could induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit the phosphorylation of signaling molecule Akt in A549 cells. Alternatively, an antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated rosline's effects on the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspases 3/7 and 9 activities, cell viabilities and the phosphorylation of Akt.

Fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 3',4',5',7'‑tetrahydroxyflavone (luteolin) against NCI‑H460 and ‑H1299 non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were determined using 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Radiosensitizing activity was assessed in vitro by treating cells with luteolin prior to irradiation of γ‑ionizing radiation (IR), and performing cell count and clonogenic assays. Cell signaling pathways involved in the radiosensitizing effects of luteolin were examined using propidium iodide (PI) uptake, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and immunoblot assays, with or without specific chemical inhibitors. Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by PI uptake and immunoblot assays. In vivo radiosensitizing activity was tested using an NCI‑H460 cell xenograft model in nude mice. Tumor size was measured and apoptosis was determined with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in animals in four treatment groups: mock‑treated control, luteolin only, IR only, and luteolin plus IR. Treatment with luteolin or IR induced NSCLC cell death in vitro, but the combination of luteolin pre‑treatment and IR was more effective than either agent alone, yielding dose enhancement ratios (DERs) of 1.22 and 1.35 for NCI‑H460 and ‑H1299 cells, respectively. Combined treatment with luteolin and IR enhanced apoptotic cell death in association with downregulation of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and activation of caspase‑3, ‑8, and ‑9; it also induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ROS accumulation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK decreased ROS production, and inhibition of either p38 MAPK or ROS production attenuated apoptotic cell death and activation of caspase‑8 and ‑9. In a xenograft model, tumor growth was delayed by 21.8 days in the luteolin/IR combination group compared with controls, and apoptotic cell death was increased. The enhancement factor of the luteolin and IR combination was 1.83.

Preclinical studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated the enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human alveolar epithelial cells by proteasome inhibitors that up-regulate DR5 expression. This effect was blocked by DR5-neutralizing Ab. Using reporter assay, we demonstrated that the p53 and NF-kappaB elements on the DR5 first intron region were involved in proteasome inhibitor-induced DR5 expression. Both p53 small interfering RNA and NF-kappaB inhibitor suppressed DR5 expression, strengthening the significance of p53 and NF-kappaB in DR5 transcription. The protein stability, Ser(392) phosphorylation and Lys(373)/Lys(382) acetylation of p53 were enhanced by MG132. In addition to p53, IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB translocation was also observed. Moreover, the binding of p53 and p65 to the first intron of DR5 was demonstrated by DNA affinity protein-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation after MG132 treatment contributed to p53, but not p65 nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity. ROS scavenger dramatically inhibited the apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors plus TRAIL. The p53-null H1299 cells were resistant to proteasome inhibitor-induced DR5 up-regulation and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings reveal that proteasome inhibitor-mediated NF-kappaB and ROS-dependent p53 activation are contributed to intronic regulation of DR5 transcription, and resulted in the subsequent enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Transcript fusions as a result of chromosomal rearrangements have been a focus of attention in cancer as they provide attractive therapeutic targets. To identify novel fusion transcripts with the potential to be exploited therapeutically, we analyzed RNA sequencing, DNA copy number and gene mutation data from 4366 primary tumor samples. To avoid false positives, we implemented stringent quality criteria that included filtering of fusions detected in RNAseq data from 364 normal tissue samples. Our analysis identified 7887 high confidence fusion transcripts across 13 tumor types. Our fusion prediction was validated by evidence of a genomic rearrangement for 78 of 79 fusions in 48 glioma samples where whole-genome sequencing data were available. Cancers with higher levels of genomic instability showed a corresponding increase in fusion transcript frequency, whereas tumor samples harboring fusions contained statistically significantly fewer driver gene mutations, suggesting an important role for tumorigenesis. We identified at least one in-frame protein kinase fusion in 324 of 4366 samples (7.4%). Potentially druggable kinase fusions involving ALK, ROS, RET, NTRK and FGFR gene families were detected in bladder carcinoma (3.3%), glioblastoma (4.4%), head and neck cancer (1.0%), low-grade glioma (1.5%), lung adenocarcinoma (1.6%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (2.3%) and thyroid carcinoma (8.7%), suggesting a potential for application of kinase inhibitors across tumor types. In-frame fusion transcripts involving histone methyltransferase or histone demethylase genes were detected in 111 samples (2.5%) and may additionally be considered as therapeutic targets. In summary, we described the landscape of transcript fusions detected across a large number of tumor samples and revealed fusion events with clinical relevance that have not been previously recognized. Our results support the concept of basket clinical trials where patients are matched with experimental therapies based on their genomic profile rather than the tissue where the tumor originated. ",

The results demonstrated enhanced cell death following combination treatment of SWNT/GO and Tx indicating a synergistic effect. In addition, synergism was abrogated in the presence of an anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and was therefore shown to be reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent. It was further demonstrated using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay that treatment with CNs was associated with enhanced mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) activation that was ROS mediated.

SMMC-7721 cells exposed to fucoidan displayed growth inhibition and several typical features of apoptotic cells, such as chromatin condensation and marginalization, a decrease in the number of mitochondria, and in mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation. Fucoidan-induced cell death was associated with depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), accumulation of high intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and accompanied by damage to the mitochondrial ultrastructure, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, Δψm) and caspase activation. Moreover, fucoidan led to altered expression of factors related to apoptosis, including downregulating Livin and XIAP mRNA, which are members of the inhibitor of apoptotic protein (IAP) family, and increased the Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio.

In the present work, we have analyzed the role of MAP17 expression during mammary cancer progression. We have found that MAP17 is expressed in 60% human mammary tumors while it is not expressed in normal or benign neoplasias. MAP17 levels increased with breast tumor stage and were strongly correlated with mammary tumoral progression. A significant increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in MAP17-expressing cells, as compared with parental cells. This increase was further paralleled by an increase in the tumorigenic capacity of carcinoma cells but not in immortal non-tumoral breast epithelial cells, which provides a selective advantage once tumorigenesis has begun. Expression of specific MAP17 shRNA in protein-expressing tumor cells reduced their tumorigenic capabilities, which suggests that this effect is dependent upon MAP17 protein expression. Our data show that ROS functions as a second messenger that enhances tumoral properties, which are inhibited in non-tumoral cells. We have found that p38α activation mediates this response. MAP17 triggers a ROS-dependent, senescence-like response that is abolished in the absence of p38a activation. Furthermore, in human breast tumors, MAP17 activation is correlated with a lack of phosphorylation of p38α. Therefore, MAP17 is overexpressed in late-stage breast tumors, in which oncogenic activity relies on p38 insensitivity to induce intracellular ROS.",

We found that the relatively low concentrations of H2O2 ranging from 10 microM to 100 microM induced predominantly apoptosis, whereas higher concentration of H2O2 ranging 1 mM-10 mM induced predominantly necrosis in HFL-1 cells. Extracellular supplementation of glutathione (GSH) in culture media significantly abolished the H2O2-induced cell death, whereas GSH-depleted cells by pretreatment with buthionine sulfoxime (BSO) were likely to undergo cell death caused by a lower concentration of H2O2 than normal HFL-1 cells without BSO treatment.

Considering that PM is highly heterogeneous, the potential health risks of PM promoting tumor metastasis in lung cancer, as well as its chemical characteristics, remain elusive. In the present study, we collected PM2.5 and PM10 in a peri-urban residential site of Taiyuan and determined the concentration and source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results indicated that 18 PAHs, ranging from 38.21 to 269.69 ng/m(3) (for PM2.5) and from 44.34 to 340.78 ng/m(3) (for PM10), exhibited seasonal variations, and the PAHs in winter PM mainly originated from coal combustion. We calculated the benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent (BaPeq) and found that the PAH-bound PM in winter exhibited higher carcinogenic risks for humans.

Injured cells are replaced through increased proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Failure to modulate these processes leads to excessive cell proliferation, collagen deposition, fibrosis, and chronic lung disease. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is activated in response to DNA damage and participates in DNA repair, genomic integrity, and cell death. In this study, we evaluated the role of PARP-1 in lung repair during recovery after acute hyperoxia exposure. We exposed PARP-1 -/- and wild-type mice for 64 h to 100% hyperoxia and let them recover in air for 5-21 days. PARP-1-deficient mice exhibited significantly higher lung cell hyperplasia and proliferation than PARP-1 +/+ animals after 5 and 10 days of recovery. This was accompanied by an increased inflammatory response in PARP-1 -/- compared with wild-type animals, characterized by neutrophil infiltration and increased IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavages. These lesions were reversible, since the extent of the hyperplastic regions was reduced after 21 days of recovery and did not result in fibrosis. In vitro, lung primary fibroblasts derived from PARP-1 -/- mice showed a higher proliferative response than PARP-1 +/+ cells during air recovery after hyperoxia-induced growth arrest. Altogether, these results reveal an essential role of PARP-1 in the control of cell repair and tissue remodeling after hyperoxia-induced lung injury.",

The lungs are exposed daily to oxidants generated either endogenously or exogenously (air pollutants, cigarette smoke, etc.). Cells in aerobic organisms are protected against oxidative damage by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Recent epidemiologic investigations have shown associations between increased incidence of respiratory diseases and lung cancer from exposure to low levels of various forms of respirable fibers and particulate matter (PM), at occupational or urban air polluting environments. Lung cancer increases substantially for tobacco smokers due to the synergistic effects in the generation of ROS, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation with high DNA damage potential. Physical and chemical characteristics of particles (size, transition metal content, speciation, stable free radicals, etc.) play an important role in oxidative stress. In turn, oxidative stress initiates the synthesis of mediators of pulmonary inflammation in lung epithelial cells and initiation of carcinogenic mechanisms. Inhalable quartz, metal powders, mineral asbestos fibers, ozone, soot from gasoline and diesel engines, tobacco smoke and PM from ambient air pollution (PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅) are involved in various oxidative stress mechanisms. Pulmonary cancer initiation and promotion has been linked to a series of biochemical pathways of oxidative stress, DNA oxidative damage, macrophage stimulation, telomere shortening, modulation of gene expression and activation of transcription factors with important role in carcinogenesis.

To determine if targeting catalase (CAT) to the mitochondria provides better protection than cytosolic expression against H(2)O(2)-induced injury, the following two approaches were taken: 1) adenoviral-mediated transduction was performed using cytosolic (CCAT) or mitochondrial (MCAT) CAT cDNAs and 2) stable cell lines were generated overexpressing CAT in mitochondria (n = 3). Cells were exposed to 250 microM H(2)O(2), and cell survival, mitochondrial function, cytochrome c release, and JNK activity were analyzed. Although all viral transduced cells had a transient twofold increase in CAT activity, MCAT cells had significantly higher survival rates, the best mitochondrial function, and lowest JNK activity compared with CCAT and LacZ controls. The improved protection with MCAT was observed in primary type II lung epithelial cells and in transformed lung epithelial cells. In the three stable cell lines, cell survival directly correlated with extent of mitochondrial localization (r = 0.60572, P < 0.05) and not overall CAT activity (r = -0.45501, P < 0.05).

The direct effects of UFPs on vascular endothelium remain unknown. We hypothesized that exposure to UFPs leads to endothelial cell O(2)(-) generation via NADPH oxidase and results in activation of endothelial cells. Our results showed that UFPs, at a non-toxic dose, induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MPMVEC) that was inhibited by pre-treatment with the ROS scavengers or inhibitors, but not with the mitochondrial inhibitor, rotenone. UFP-induced ROS generation in MPMVEC was abolished by p67(phox) siRNA transfection and UFPs did not cause ROS generation in MPMVEC isolated from gp91(phox) knock-out mice. UFP-induced ROS generation in endothelial cells was also determined in vivo by using a perfused lung model with imaging. Moreover, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining results showed that MPMVEC treated with UFPs resulted in the translocation of cytosolic proteins of NADPH oxidase, p47(phox), p67(phox) and rac 1, to the plasma membrane. These results demonstrate that NADPH oxidase in the pulmonary endothelium is involved in ROS generation following exposure to UFPs. To investigate the activation of endothelial cells by UFP-induced oxidative stress, we determined the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in MPMVEC. Our results showed that exposure of MPMVEC to UFPs caused increased phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs that was blocked by pre-treatment with DPI or p67(phox) siRNA. Exposure of MPMVEC obtained from gp91(phox) knock-out mice to UFPs did not cause increased phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs. These findings confirm that UFPs can cause endothelial cells to generate ROS directly via activation of NADPH oxidase. UFP-induced ROS lead to activation of MAPKs through induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs that may further result in endothelial dysfunction through production of cytokines such as IL-6.

NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) has been reported to be a major source of ROS with pulmonary inflammation. NOX2 is expressed by both endothelial and immune cells. Here we use VCAM-targeted QDs in a mouse model to show that NOX2, specifically endothelial NOX2, induces VCAM expression with lung inflammation in vivo. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with increased incidence of ICU-related morbidity and mortality, primarily from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. One explanation is that alcohol regulates epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) via oxidant signaling to promote a pro- injury environment. We used small rodent models to mimic acute and chronic alcohol consumption and tested the hypothesis that ethanol (EtOH) would affect lung fluid clearance by up-regulating ENaC activity in the lung. Fluorescence labeling of rat lung slices and in vivo mouse lung revealed an increase in ROS production in response to acute EtOH exposure. Using western blots and fluorescein-5-maleimide labeling, we conclude that EtOH exposure modifies cysteines of α-ENaC while data from single channel patch clamp analysis confirm that 0.16% EtOH increased ENaC activity in rat alveolar cells. In vivo lung fluid clearance demonstrated a latent increase in fluid clearance in mice receiving EtOH diet. Ethanol mice given a tracheal instillation of LPS demonstrated early lung fluid clearance compared to caloric control mice and C57Bl/6 mice. Standard biochemical techniques reveal that chronic EtOH consumption resulted in greater protein expression of the catalytic gp91(phox) subunit and the obligate Rac1 protein. Collectively these data suggest that chronic EtOH consumption may lead to altered regulation of ENaC, contributing to a 'pro-injury' environment in the alcohol lung.",

RH-1 action is associated with;quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) which reduces this diaziridinylbenzoquinone into DNA-alkylating hydroquinone and is overexpressed in many tumors. Another suggested mechanism of RH-1 toxicity is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising from its redox cycling. In order to improve anticancer action of this and similar antitumor quinones, we investigated the involvement of different signaling molecules in cytotoxicity induced by RH-1 by using wild-type tumor suppressor p53 bearing nonsmall cell lung carcinoma A549 cells as a model. Gradual and prolonged increase of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK, P38, and JNK phosphorylation was observed during 24-h RH-1 treatment. In parallel, activation of DNA damage-sensing ATM kinase, upregulation, and phosphorylation of TP53 (human p53) took place. Inhibition studies revealed that RH-1-induced A549 apoptosis involved the NQO1-ATM-p53 signaling pathway and ROS generation. TP53 participated in ROS- and DNA damage-induced cell death differently. Moreover, MAP kinase JNK was another TP53 activator and death inducer in A549 cells. At the same time, rapid and prolonged activation of AKT kinase during RH-1 treatment was found, and it proved to be antiapoptotic kinase in our model system. Therefore, we identified that different and opposite cell death regulating signaling pathways, which may counteract one another, are induced in cancer cells during chemotherapeutic RH-1 treatment.",

Studies of silica, silicosis and lung cancer published from 1997 onwards are then reviewed in the search of any new advances in knowledge about silica carcinogenicity. Finally, other possible confounding factors contributing to inconsistent findings on silica, silicosis, and lung cancer are reviewed.;Host factors, physico-chemical characteristics of the surface of silica particles, exposure circumstances, and the mineral ore composition experimentally affect the ability of silica particles of inducing release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and TNF-alpha by alveolar macrophages, possibly accounting for the great variation in lung cancer risk among dust exposed workers across the individual studies. Most recent epidemiological studies do not consider such complex pattern of modifying factors, and they keep replicating inconsistent findings. The hypothesis of a silicosis-mediated pathway, although more consistent from an epidemiological perspectives, and reassuring in terms of the effectiveness of current standards in preventing lung cancer risk among silica exposed workers, does not seem to explain elevated risks at low silica exposure levels.;Future studies of lung cancer risk among workers exposed to silica-containing dust should consider measurement of ROS and TNF-alpha release by workplace dust samples as intermediate end-points predicting lung cancer risk better than silica concentration, allowing to more effectively address preventive action.",

Epidemiological evidence is ambiguous and conflicting. Experimental data show that high levels of CS cause lung cancer in rats, although not in other species, including mice, guinea pigs, or hamsters; but the relevance of such animal data to humans has been uncertain. This article applies recent insights into the toxicology of lung diseases caused by poorly soluble particles (PSPs), and by CS in particular, to model the exposure-response relation between CS and risk of lung pathologies such as chronic inflammation, silicosis, fibrosis, and lung cancer. An inflammatory mode of action is described, having substantial empirical support, in which exposure increases alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the alveolar epithelium, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, and eventual damage to lung tissue and epithelial hyperplasia, resulting in fibrosis and increased lung cancer risk among silicotics. This mode of action involves several positive feedback loops. Exposures that increase the gain factors around such loops can create a disease state with elevated levels of ROS, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils. This mechanism implies a \"tipping point\" threshold for the exposure-response relation. Applying this new model to epidemiological data, we conclude that current permissible exposure levels, on the order of 0.1 mg/m³, are probably below the threshold for triggering lung diseases in humans.",

We report here that cisplatin resistant lung cancer cell lines possess high basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when compared to normal cells and their parental cell counterparts. These resistant cells also have low thioredoxin (TRX) levels which may be one of the contributory factors to high ROS. N'(1),N'(3)-dimethyl-N'(1),N'(3)-bis(phenylcarbonothioyl) propanedihydrazide (elesclomol), an agent known to increase ROS is selectively toxic to cisplatin-resistant cells, while sparing normal cells and the parental counterpart. The cytotoxic effect of elesclomol in resistant cells is accompanied by further decreases in TRX and glutathione (GSH) antioxidant systems, while opposite results were found in parental cells. The ID(50) of elesclomol in cisplatin-resistant cells ranged from 5-10 nM, which is well within clinically achievable ranges. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), which is known to neutralize ROS, can abolish the cytotoxic effect of elesclomol, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect results from increased ROS. Overall, our data suggest that elesclomol selectively kills cisplatin-resistant tumor cells through increased ROS.

We hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibit NO-dependent pulmonary vasodilation following CH. To test this hypothesis, we examined responses to the EDNO-dependent vasodilator endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) in isolated lungs from control and CH rats in the presence or absence of ROS scavengers under normoxic or hypoxic ventilation. NOS was inhibited in lungs used for SNAP experiments to eliminate influences of endogenously produced NO. Additionally, dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence was measured as an index of ROS levels in isolated pressurized small pulmonary arteries from each group. We found that acute hypoxia increased DCF fluorescence and attenuated vasodilatory responses to ET-1 in lungs from control rats. The addition of ROS scavengers augmented ET-1-induced vasodilation in lungs from both groups during hypoxic ventilation. In contrast, upon NOS inhibition, DCF fluorescence was elevated and SNAP-induced vasodilation diminished in arteries from CH rats during normoxia, whereas acute hypoxia decreased DCF fluorescence, which correlated with augmented reactivity to SNAP in both groups. ROS scavengers enhanced SNAP-induced vasodilation in normoxia-ventilated lungs from CH rats similar to effects of hypoxic ventilation. We conclude that inhibition of NOS during normoxia leads to greater ROS generation in lungs from both control and CH rats.

To provide insight into whether the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin might attenuate oxidant-induced lung injury, we examined the effect of apocynin on (1) sepsis-induced lung injury in guinea pigs, (2) ROS generation by LPS-stimulated neutrophils measured by chemiluminescence (CL), and (3) LPS-stimulated neutrophil-mediated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) injury assessed by 51Cr release. Sepsis-induced lung injury in guinea pigs was assessed by comparing 125I-labeled albumin concentrations in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid relative to plasma (L/P and BAL/P), lung wet-to-dry weight ratios, and the number of neutrophils in BAL fluid. The lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, L/P, and the number of neutrophils in BAL fluid decreased after pretreatment and post-treatment with apocynin. BAL/P decreased upon pretreatment but not upon post-treatment with apocynin. Apocynin at concentrations from 10 to 100 micrograms/ml significantly reduced LPS-stimulated neutrophil CL and neutrophil-mediated HUVEC 51Cr release. We conclude that the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin attenuates (1) sepsis-induced lung injury in guinea pigs, (2) neutrophil ROS generation measured by CL, and (3) neutrophil-mediated HUVEC injury assessed by 51Cr release.",

All these conditions are characterised by an imbalance between the amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and available antioxidant defences. In the lung, ROS arise from endogenous sources, such as the influx of inflammatory cells or exogenous sources, such as from air pollution and cigarette smoke. When ROS production increases the redox balance of the airways alters, and this can lead to bronchial hyperactivity and further inflammation. The lung, like many other tissues, has a range of antioxidant defences which help to maintain a balanced redox status. These antioxidants are present in the intracellular, the vascular and extracellular respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) compartments. The reduced glutathione (GSH) content of RTLF is particularly high and new findings are beginning to reveal the role that the RTLF GSH pool plays in defending the lung.",

The susceptibility of lung cells to this injury is unknown - but is of great interest as oxygen is used in lung preservation. Therefore, we studied whether preservation injury to lung epithelial cells can be influenced by iron chelators.;A549 lung epithelial cells were preserved at 4°C for varying periods in either cell culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM), Bretschneider histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK), modified HTK, Celsior, or low potassium dextran (LPD) solution with/without the iron chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl, deferoxamine, or LK 614 and then rewarmed in cell culture medium (for 3h). Lethal cell injury (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release or propidium iodide uptake), metabolic activity, morphological alterations, and lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, TBARS) were assessed.;Lung epithelial cells sustained substantial damage after cold storage/rewarming (LDH release: DMEM 66±12% and 97±1%, HTK 73±14% and 97±1%, Celsior 81±16% and 97±1%, LPD 39±14% and 96±1% after 24h, n=7, and 7 days, n=6, respectively). TBARS were increased. Iron chelators strongly inhibited the damage in all solutions (LDH release after 7 days' cold storage in the presence of 2,2'-dipyridyl: below 8% in all solutions except LPD, LPD 15±4%). This was confirmed using the other iron chelators and the other parameters of injury.;Hypothermic storage of lung cells leads to iron-dependent oxidative cell injury. These results suggest that the addition of iron chelators to existing or novel preservation solutions might decrease lung preservation injury, and this should now be tested in experimental lung transplantation.",

IL-8, a major chemotactic cytokine for neutrophils and T lymphocytes, plays important roles in the development of lung injury. To further understand the role of ESAT-6 in lung pathology associated with tuberculosis development, we studied the effects of ESAT-6 on the regulation of IL-8 expression in lung epithelial cells. ESAT-6 induced IL-8 expression by increasing IL-8 gene transcription and mRNA stability. ESAT-6 induction of IL-8 promoter activity was dependent on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding and sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of PKC and ERK and p38 MAPK pathways. ESAT-6 activated ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation and rapidly induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Dimethylthiourea but not mannitol inhibited IL-8 induction by ESAT-6, further supporting the involvement of ROS in the induction of IL-8 expression. Exposure of mice to ESAT-6 induced localized inflammatory cell aggregate formation with characteristics of early granuloma concomitant with increased keratinocyte chemoattractant CXCL1 staining in bronchiolar and alveolar type II epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Our studies have identified a signal transduction pathway involving ROS, PKC, ERK, and p38 MAPKs and NF-κB and AP-1 in the ESAT-6 induction of IL-8 expression in lung epithelial cells. This has important implications for the understanding of lung innate immune responses to tuberculosis and the pathogenesis of lung injury in tuberculosis. ",

Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress is considered a major mechanism of quartz toxicity. Curcumin, a yellow pigment from Curcuma longa, has been considered as nutraceutical because of its strong anti-inflammatory, antitumour and antioxidant properties. The aim of our present study was to investigate whether curcumin can protect lung epithelial cells from the cytotoxic, genotoxic and inflammatory effects associated with quartz (DQ12) exposure. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements using the spin-trap DMPO demonstrated that curcumin reduces hydrogen peroxide-dependent hydroxyl-radical formation by quartz. Curcumin was also found to reduce quartz-induced cytotoxicity and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) mRNA expression in RLE-6TN rat lung epithelial cells (RLE). Curcumin also inhibited the release of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) from RLE cells as observed upon treatment with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). However, curcumin failed to protect the RLE cells from oxidative DNA damage induced by quartz, as shown by formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG)-modified comet assay and by immunocytochemistry for 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. In contrast, curcumin was found to be a strong inducer of oxidative DNA damage itself at non-cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory concentrations. In line with this, curcumin also enhanced the mRNA expression of the oxidative stress response gene heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1). Curcumin also caused oxidative DNA damage in NR8383 rat alveolar macrophages and A549 human lung epithelial cells. Taken together, these observations indicate that one should be cautious in considering the potential use of curcumin in the prevention or treatment of lung diseases associated with quartz exposure.",

Mice were injected intratracheally (IT) with LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (LPS, 1 or 5 mg/kg), either concurrently with LPS or 2 h later, and evaluated for lung injury 24 h later. MJ33 inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by lungs when measured at 24 h after LPS. LPS at either a low or high dose significantly increased lung infiltration with inflammatory cells, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-2), expression of lung vascular cell adhesion molecule, lung permeability (protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, leakage of FITC-dextran, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio), tissue lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, 8-isoprostanes), tissue protein oxidation (protein carbonyls), and activation of NF-κB. MJ33, given either concurrently or 2 h subsequent to LPS, significantly reduced all of these measured parameters. Previous studies of toxicity showed a high margin of safety for MJ33 in the intact mouse. Thus we have identified MJ33 as a potent, nontoxic, and specific mechanism-based inhibitor of NADPH oxidase type 2-mediated ROS generation that protects mice against lung injury associated with inflammation.

This new complex, [VO(dios)(OH)3]Na5·6H2O (VOdios), has been synthesized and characterized both in solid and solution states. The interaction of the metal ion through the sugar moiety of diosmin precluded the improvement of the antioxidant effects.

Persistent inhalation of the invading pathogens or toxic agents may result in overwhelming production of ROS. Oxidants initiate a number of pathologic processes, including inflammation of the airways, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or exacerbation of airways disease. During inflammation, enhanced ROS production may induce recurring DNA damage, inhibition of apoptosis, and activation of protooncogenes by initiating signal transduction pathways.

In the lungs of BLM-treated mice, the expression of TRX was strongly induced in bronchial epithelial cells. TRX expression was also up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in cultured BEC with the treatment with BLM. However, the expression of other major antioxidants, such as Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, was not affected by BLM. These observations suggest that the cellular reduction and oxidation (redox) state modified by TRX is involved in the BLM resistancy and the induction of TRX in bronchial epithelial cells might play a protective role in BLM-induced lung injury.",

In the present study, the anticancer effects of CuE on 95D lung cancer cells were investigated. CuE decreased cell viability, inhibited colony formation, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a concentration-dependent manner, which were reversed by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). CuE induced apoptosis as determined by JC-1 staining, expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, cleavage of caspases, and TUNEL staining. NAC and Ac-DEVD-CHO partially reversed CuE-induced cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP. Furthermore, CuE caused accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and concentration- and time-dependent expression of LC3II protein. Autophagy inhibitors chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 enhanced CuE-induced LC3II expression and cell death. CuE-triggered protein expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, Beclin-1, and p-ULK1 was partially reversed by NAC pretreatment. In addition, CuE treatment damaged F-actin without affecting β-tubulin as confirmed by immunofluorescence. In conclusion, CuE induced ROS-dependent apoptosis through Bcl-2 family and caspases in 95D lung cancer cells. Furthermore, CuE induced protective autophagy mediated by ROS through AKT/mTOR pathway. This study provides novel roles of ROS in the anticancer effect of CuE. ",

Studies have indicated that there is gain of Nrf2 function in lung cancer and other solid tumors because of mutations in the inhibitor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). More recently, several oncogenes have been shown to activate Nrf2 signaling as the main prosurvival pathway mediating ROS detoxification, senescence evasion, and neoplastic transformation. Thus, it is important to determine if there is any risk of enhanced lung tumorigenesis associated with prolonged administration of SFN using mouse models of cancer.;We evaluated the effect of prolonged SFN treatment on oncogenic K-ras (K-ras(LSL-G12D))-driven lung tumorigenesis. One week post mutant-K-ras expression, mice were treated with SFN (0.5 mg, 5 d/wk) for 3 months by means of a nebulizer. Fourteen weeks after mutant K-ras expression (K-ras(LSL-G12D)), mice were sacrificed, and lung sections were screened for neoplastic foci. Expression of Nrf2-dependent genes was measured using real time RT-PCR. We also determined the effect of prolonged SFN treatment on the growth of preclinical xenograft models using human A549 (with mutant K-ras and Keap1 allele) and H1975 [with mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) allele] nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.;Systemic SFN administration did not promote the growth of K-ras(LSL-G12D)-induced lung tumors and had no significant effect on the growth of A549 and H1975 established tumor xenografts in nude mice. Interestingly, localized delivery of SFN significantly attenuated the growth of A549 tumors in nude mice, suggesting an Nrf2-independent antitumorigenic activity of SFN.;Our results demonstrate that prolonged SFN treatment does not promote lung tumorigenesis in various mouse models of lung cancer.",

The results indicate that the methanolic extract of oil fumes can apparently lead to cytotoxicity and oxidative DNA damage. Glutathione (GSH) content, and the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as GSH reductase, GSH peroxidase and GSH S-transferase were adversely reduced by the methanolic extract of oil fumes. t-t-2,4-DDE could produce superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and form intracellular ROS, determined by dichlorofluorescein assay in A-549 cells. Moreover, t-t-2,4-DDE caused significant (P <0.05) oxidative damage of the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine formation in A-549 cells at concentrations from 50 to 200 microM.

Peroxiredoxin I (PrxI), an enzyme responsible for eliminating hydrogen peroxide, has been found to be elevated in many types of cancer cells. Since overexpression of PrxI promoted cancer cells' survival and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PrxI has been proposed as a therapeutic target for anticancer drugs. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anticancer efficacy of a small molecule inhibitor of PrxI.;By a high-throughput screening approach, we identified AMRI-59 as a potent inhibitor of PrxI. AMRI-59 increased cellular ROS, leading to the activation of both mitochondria- and apoptosis signal-regulated kinase-1-mediated signaling pathways, resulting in apoptosis of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma. AMRI-59 caused no significant changes in ROS level, proliferation, and apoptosis of PrxI-knockdown A549 cells by RNA interference. PrxI overexpression or N-acetylcysteine pretreatment abrogated AMRI-59-induced cytotoxicity in A549 cells. AMRI-59 rendered tumorigenic ovarian cells more susceptible to ROS-mediated death compared with nontumorigenic cells. Moreover, significant antitumor activity of AMRI-59 was observed in mouse tumor xenograft model implanted with A549 cells with no apparent acute toxicity.;This study offers preclinical proof-of-concept for AMRI-59, a lead small molecule inhibitor of PrxI, as an anticancer agent.;Our results highlight a promising strategy for cancer therapy that preferentially eradicates cancer cells by targeting the PrxI-mediated redox-dependent survival pathways.",

This review describes the sources of endogenous and exogenous ROS generation in the lung. Special emphasis is given to major sources of ROS in occupational and environmental exposures to asbestos, crystalline silica, coal, chromium, herbicides, bleomycin, and cigarette smoke. ROS-induced lung injury at different target levels may contribute to similar patterns of cell injury and alterations at the molecular level by initiation, propagation, and autocatalytic chain reactions. Intracellular signalling, activation and inactivation of enzymes, stimulation, secretion, and release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and nuclear factor activation and alterations are also common events.

Our earlier studies on the ischemia-induced mechanosignaling cascade showed that the pulmonary endothelium responds to stop of flow by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that ROS produced in this way led to induction of proinflammatory mediators. In this study, we used lungs or cells subjected to various periods of storage and evaluated the induction of several proinflammatory mediators. Isolated murine, porcine and human lungs in situ showed increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules; the damage-associated molecular pattern protein high-mobility group box 1 and the corresponding pattern recognition receptor, called the receptor for advanced glycation end products; and induction stabilization and translocation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and its downstream effector VEGFA, all of which are participants in inflammation.

Plasma NGS was then blindly performed on 48 patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC and a known tumor genotype, and explored in two patients with incomplete tumor genotyping.;NGS could identify mutations present in DNA dilutions at ≥ 0.4% allelic frequency with 100% sensitivity/specificity. Plasma NGS detected a broad range of driver and resistance mutations, including ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements, HER2 insertions, and MET amplification, with 100% specificity. Sensitivity was 77% across 62 known driver and resistance mutations from the 48 cases; in 29 cases with common EGFR and KRAS mutations, sensitivity was similar to droplet digital PCR. In two cases with incomplete tumor genotyping, plasma NGS rapidly identified a novel EGFR exon 19 deletion and a missed case of MET amplification.;Blinded to tumor genotype, this plasma NGS approach detected a broad range of targetable genomic alterations in NSCLC with no false positives including complex mutations like rearrangements and unexpected resistance mutations such as EGFR C797S. Through use of widely available vacutainers and a desktop sequencing platform, this assay has the potential to be implemented broadly for patient care and translational research.",

Although extensive studies suggested that phospodiesterase type 4B (PDE4B) may be related to inflammation, the underlying cell biological mechanism of ALI remains unclear. To further investigate the mechanism how PDE4B take part in inflammatory response and the maintenance of vascular integrity, we established the experimental model of ALI in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, we found that Cilomilast, Diazepam and PDE4B knockout could potently inhibit the LPS-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory response in multiple cell types, including lung epithelial cells (A549), pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Besides, PDE4B deletion attenuated the LPS-induced ROS generation. In vivo, PDE4B deletion could attenuate the lung water content, histological signs of pulmonary injury and elevate the ratio of partial pressure of arterial O2 to fraction of inspired O2 (PaO2/FIO2 ratio). Additionally, PDE4B deletion reduced LPS-induced vascular permeability. Collectively, our results strongly indicates that PDE4B is a valid target for anti-ALI.",

This review focuses on the cellular actions and interactions of key inflammatory cells and target cells in coal dust toxicity and related lung disorders, i.e. macrophages and neutrophils, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. Factors released from or affecting these cells are outlined in separate sections, i.e. (1) reactive oxygen species (ROS) and related antioxidant protection mechanisms, and (2) cytokines, growth factors and related proteins. Furthermore, (3) components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including the modifying role of ROS, cytokines, proteases and antiproteases are discussed in relation to tissue damage and remodelling in the respiratory tract. It is recognised that inhaled coal dust particles are important non-cellular and cellular sources of ROS in the lung, and may be significantly involved in the damage of lung target cells as well as important macromolecules including alpha-1-antitrypsin and DNA. In vitro and in vivo studies with coal dusts showed the up-regulation of important leukocyte recruiting factors, e.g. Leukotriene-B4 (LTB4), Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF alpha), as well as the neutrophil adhesion factor Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Coal dust particles are also known to stimulate the (macrophage) production of various factors with potential capacity to modulate lung cells and/or extracellular matrix, including O2-., H2O2, and NO, fibroblast chemoattractants (e.g. Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF beta), PDGF, and fibronectin) and a number of factors that have been shown to stimulate and/or inhibit fibroblast growth or collagen production such as (TNF alpha, TGF beta, PDGF, Insulin Like Growth Factor, and Prostaglandin-E2).

ROS have been known to play an important role in the initiation and promotion of multistage carcinogenesis. The cellular antioxidant defence plays a crucial role in neoplastic disease. However, very little is known about the tissue antioxidant defence in thyroid cancers. We therefore undertook a study to assess the role of ROS in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancers. Our samples consisted of post-operated thyroid tissues (normal, goiters, follicular adenomas, follicular carcinomas and papillary carcinomas). The parameters studied were lipid peroxidation (LP), antioxidant enzymes--superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)--and non-protein thiols (GSH). Compared to normal thyroid no changes were seen in goiters. LP was significantly higher in adenomas (16%) and carcinomas (60-69%). SOD was decreased by 15% in adenomas while in carcinomas it increased by 9-12%. GPx was raised in carcinomas by 10-21%. Follicular carcinomas showed a 4% increase in CAT activity while GSH was raised in adenomas and papillary carcinomas by 17%. Thus, in adenomas (initial stage) involvement of superoxide radicals and in carcinomas (later stage) hydrogen peroxide and, possibly, hydroxyl radical involvement cannot be ruled out. These ROS may be responsible for elevated LP observed in adenomas and carcinomas.",

In contrast, the diagnosis of other cancers at a young age has been demonstrated to define unique disease biology. Herein, we report on the association of young age with targetable genomic alterations and prognosis in a cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC.;To determine the relationship between young age at diagnosis and the presence of a potentially targetable genomic alteration, disease prognosis, and natural history.;A cohort of all 2237 patients with NSCLC who were genotyped at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between January 2002 and December 2014 were identified. Tumor genotype, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes were collected and studied at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between age and mutation status, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for survival analysis.;The frequency of targetable genomic alterations by defined age categories as well as the association of these age groups with survival. Age categories used in this analysis were younger than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years or older.;A cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC was studied. Of the 2237 participants, 1939 (87%) had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, 269 (12%) had NSCLC not otherwise specified, and 29 (1%) had squamous histologic findings; 1396 (63%) had either stage IIIB or IV cancers; and median (range) age was 62 (20-95) years. We found that gene mutations for EGFR (P = .02) and ALK (P < .001) were associated with cancer diagnosis at a younger age, and a similar trend existed for ERBB2 (P = .15) and ROS1 (P = .10) but not BRAF V600E (P = .43). Among patients tested for all 5 targetable genomic alterations (n = 1325), younger age was associated with an increased frequency of a targetable genotype (P < .001). Those diagnosed at 50 years or younger have a 59% increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype. While presence of a potentially targetable genomic alteration treated with a targeted agent was associated with improved survival, the youngest and oldest age groups had similarly poor outcomes even when a targetable genotype was present.;Younger age is associated with an increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype and is an underappreciated clinical biomarker in NSCLC. The survival of young patients with NCSLC is unexpectedly poor compared with other age groups, suggesting more aggressive disease biology. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive genotyping, including next-generation sequencing, in younger patients with lung cancer.",

B[a]P-mediated generation of ROS was detected in incubations with rat lung, but not with liver microsomes. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) by the non isoform-specific inhibitor SKF-525A resulted in a complete inhibition of B[a]P-dependent ROS formation, whereas ROS formation was not affected by inhibition of prostaglandin H synthase by indomethacin. Subsequently, bulky DNA adduct formation and 8-oxo-dG levels after a single oral dose of B[a]P were examined in vivo in rat lung and liver, in combination with urinary excretion of 8-oxodG. B[a]P exposure resulted in increased urinary 8-oxo-dG levels. On the contrary, 8-oxo-dG levels decreased in liver and lung after B[a]P exposure. Bulky DNA adducts reached higher levels and were more persistent in rat lung than in liver. These results indicate that ROS are generated during the CYP450 dependent metabolism of B[a]P, particularly in the rat lung, but this does not necessarily result in increased levels of oxidative DNA damage in vivo, possibly by induction of DNA repair mechanisms.",

Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) are shown to be produced and released during surgery, the effects of ROS on the liver vascular lining and tumour cell adhesion were investigated.;Human endothelial cell monolayers (human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human microvascular endothelial cells of the lung (HMEC-1s)) were exposed to ROS production, after which electrical impedance, cellular integrity and tumour cell adhesion were investigated. Furthermore, surgery-induced tumour cell adhesion as well as the role of ROS and liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) in this process were studied in vivo.;Production of ROS decreased cellular impedance of endothelial monolayers dramatically. Moreover, formation of intercellular gaps in endothelial monolayers was observed, exposing subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) on which colon carcinoma cells adhered via integrin molecules. Endothelial damage was, however, prevented in the presence of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Additionally, surgery induced downregulation of both rat and human liver tight junction molecules. Treatment of rats with the ROS scavenger edaravone prevented surgery-induced tumour cell adhesion and downregulation of tight junction proteins in the liver. Interestingly, depletion of Kupffer cells prior to surgery significantly reduced the numbers of adhered tumour cells and prevented disruption of expression of tight junction proteins.;In this study it is shown that surgery-induced ROS production by macrophages damages the vascular lining by downregulating tight junction proteins. This leads to exposure of ECM, to which circulating tumour cells bind. In light of this, perioperative therapeutic intervention, preventing surgery-induced inflammatory reactions, may reduce the risk of developing liver metastases, thereby improving the clinical outcome of patients with colorectal cancer.",

Alveolar macrophages contain a vesicle population, which is stained with LysoSensor probes but not by tetramethylrhodamine dextran. These vesicles, presumably secretory lysosomes, exhibit a higher pH in Cftr-deficient macrophages than the corresponding vesicles in lung macrophages isolated from wild-type (WT) mice. Alkalinization of these vesicles in Cftr-deficient macrophages correlates with a failure of the macrophages to respond to infection with various Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains by acutely activating acid sphingomyelinase, releasing ceramide, forming ceramide-enriched membrane platforms that serve to cluster gp91(phox), and, most importantly, releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, these events occur rapidly in WT lung macrophages postinfection. Inhibiting ROS in WT macrophages prevents the killing of P. aeruginosa. These findings provide evidence for a novel pH-controlled pathway from acid sphingomyelinase activation via ceramide and clustering of gp91(phox) to the release of ROS in lung macrophages.",

To study the role of mtALDH in hyperoxic lung injury, we overexpressed mtALDH in human lung epithelial cells (A549) and found that mtALDH significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced cell death. Compared with control cells (Neo-A549), the necrotic cell death in mtALDH-overexpressing cells (mtALDH-A549) decreased from 25.3 to 6.5%, 50.5 to 9.1%, and 52.4 to 15.1% after 24-, 48-, and 72-h hyperoxic exposure, respectively. The levels of intracellular and mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mtALDH-A549 cells after hyperoxic exposure were significantly lowered compared with Neo-A549 cells. mtALDH overexpression significantly stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation partially eliminated the protective effect of mtALDH in hyperoxia-induced cell death, suggesting ERK activation by mtALDH conferred cellular resistance to hyperoxia. mtALDH overexpression augmented Akt phosphorylation and maintained the total Akt level in mtALDH-A549 cells under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation by LY294002 in mtALDH-A549 cells significantly increased necrotic cell death after hyperoxic exposure, indicating that PI3K-Akt activation by mtALDH played an important role in cell survival after hyperoxia. Taken together, these data demonstrate that mtALDH overexpression attenuates hyperoxia-induced cell death in lung epithelial cells through reduction of ROS, activation of ERK/MAPK, and PI3K-Akt cell survival signaling pathways.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is closely associated with chemosensitivity of cancer cells. Overexpression of ATP binding cassette transporter MRP1 is correlated with resistance to platinum drugs. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that emodin, a potent ROS generator, may increase sensitivity of cisplatin-(cDDP-) resistant ovarian carcinoma cells to cDDP cytotoxicity via ROS-mediated suppression of MRP1 expression. Using the isogenic pair of the human ovarian carcinoma cell line COC1 and its cDDP resistant variant COC1/DDP, we found that ROS level in the cDDP-sensitive ovarian cancer cells was significantly higher than that in the cDDP-resistant cells. Emodin enhanced ROS production in COC1/DDP cells and consequently sensitized them to cDDP-induced apoptosis. These effects were reversed by addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Cotreatment with emodin and cDDP inhibited the tumor growth in vivo by increasing tumor cell apoptosis. The emodin-enhanced cDDP cytotoxicity was attributable to downregulation of multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) expression. Together, these results suggest that emodin could act as an adjunct to enhance the anticancer effect of cDDP likely through ROS-related downregulation of MRP1 expression, and may be of therapeutic potential in cDDP-refractory ovarian carcinomas.

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSC), express high levels of TWIST-1, which is down regulated during ex vivo expansion. Cultured BMSC over-expressing TWIST-1 display decreased capacity for osteogenic differentiation and an enhanced capacity to undergo adipogenesis, suggesting that TWIST-1 is a mediator of lineage commitment. However, little is known regarding the mechanism(s) by which TWIST-1 mediates cell fate determination. In this study, microarray analysis was used to identify a novel downstream TWIST-1 target, tyrosine kinase receptor c-ros-oncogene 1 (C-ROS-1), which was down regulated in TWIST-1 over-expressing BMSC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that TWIST-1 directly bound to two E-box binding sites on the proximal C-ROS-1 promoter. Knock-down of C-ROS-1 in human BMSC and cranial bone cells resulted in a decreased capacity for osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Conversely, suppression of C-ROS-1 in BMSC resulted in an enhanced capacity to undergo adipogenesis. Furthermore, reduced C-ROS-1 levels led to activation of different components of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signalling pathway during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Collectively, these data suggest that C-ROS-1 is involved in BMSC fate switching between osteogenesis and adipogenesis, mediated via PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signalling.",

Combination index (CI) values were calculated based on Chou-Talalay median-effect analyses. Dose reduction index (DRI) values were applied to calculate dose reduction of selenite. Contents of free thiols and GSH were determined by DTNB assay and intracellular ROS levels by DCFH-DA fluorescence labeling.;Compared with BBSKE or selenite single treatment, the combined application of ethaselen and a low fixed dose of selenite shortened the onset time of sodium selenite, reduced IC50 values, and increased the maximum inhibition rates, suggesting a possible molecular mechanism of the synergism. Obvious synergistic effects were observed after different times of combination treatment, especially after 24 h. Compared with selenite single treatment, dosage of selenite could be remarkably reduced in combination therapy to gain the same inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. Compared with BBSKE single treatment, the content of free thiols and GSH were significantly reduced and ROS levels greatly elevated in the combination group. For the combination treatment, cell viability increased as greater concentrations of GSH were added.;All these results indicate that the combination treatment of BBSKE and selenite showed synergism to inhibit A549 cell proliferation in vitro, and also reduced the selenite dosage to mitigate its toxicity which is very meaningful for combination chemotherapy of lung cancer. The synergism was probably caused by the accelerated exhaustion of intracellular reductive substances, such as free thiols and GSH, which ultimately leads to enhanced oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

Because viruses replicate in living cells, such metabolites influence the growth of viruses in addition to serving as a host defense mechanism. Low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in mitogenic activation, and the early phase of lytic and nonlytic virus infection indeed resembles that of mitogenic cell activation. In addition to these subtle cell-activating effects shared by many viruses, influenza and paramyxoviruses activate a respiratory burst in phagocytic cells. These viruses are toxic when injected in animals. Cells lavaged from the lungs of mice infected with influenza virus are primed for enhanced superoxide generation. Moreover, xanthine oxidase is enhanced and the buffering capacity of small molecular antioxidants is decreased in the lungs, suggesting that infection leads to oxidative stress. The wide array of cytokines produced in the lungs during influenza could contribute to the systemic effects of influenza. Oxidative stress has also been shown in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in humans. Via activation of NF kappa B, ROS may activate viral replication, but oxidants are believed to contribute also to the loss of CD4 T cells by apoptosis. Antioxidants, together with agents interfering with the harmful effects of cytokines and lipid mediators, may have a role in the treatment of viral diseases. Such agents could not only alleviate disease symptoms but also decrease the long-term effects of chronic oxidative stress, which have been linked to the development of cancer in some viral infections.",

Lung epithelial cell released IL-8 plays a crucial role in CS induced lung inflammation. CS and cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) both induce IL-8 secretion and subsequently, IL-8 recruits inflammatory cells into the lung parenchyma. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which CSE triggers IL-8 release remain not completely understood. In this study, we identified a novel extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule, CCN1, which mediated CSE induced IL-8 secretion by lung epithelial cells. We first found that CS and CSE up-regulated CCN1 expression and secretion in lung epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro. CSE up-regulated CCN1 via induction of reactive oxygen spices (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. p38 MAPK and JNK activation were also found to mediate the signal pathways in CSE induced CCN1. CCN1 was secreted into ECM via Golgi and membrane channel receptor aquaporin4. After CSE exposure, elevated ECM CCN1 functioned via an autocrine or paracrine manner. Importantly, CCN1 activated Wnt pathway receptor LRP6, subsequently stimulated Wnt pathway component Dvl2 and triggered beta-catenin translocation from cell membrane to cytosol and nucleus. Treatment of Wnt pathway inhibitor suppressed CCN1 induced IL-8 secretion from lung epithelial cells. Taken together, CSE increased CCN1 expression and secretion in lung epithelial cells via induction of ROS and ER stress. Increased ECM CCN1 resulted in augmented IL-8 release through the activation of Wnt pathway. ",

SBHA inhibited the growth of Calu-6 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells with an IC50 of 50 µM at 72 h. This agent induced apoptosis in Calu-6 cells and triggered to a G2/M phase arrest in NCI-H1299 cells. Although it also reduced the growth of normal human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells, the susceptibility of Calu-6 cells to SBHA was higher than that of HPF cells. In addition, SBHA did not affect the growth of human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC). Regarding ROS and antioxidant levels, SBHA increased ROS level and glutathione (GSH) depletion in Calu-6 and NCI-H1299 cells whereas it decreased ROS levels in HPF and HSAEC. SBHA also decreased thioredoxin1 (Trx1) level in Calu-6 cells. Although the down-regulation of Trx1 intensified apoptosis and ROS level in SBHA-treated Calu-6 cells, the overexpression of Trx1 attenuated apoptosis and ROS level in these cells. This down-regulation of Trx1 did not affect apoptosis-signaling regulating kinase1 (ASK1) activation. In conclusion, the down-regulation of Trx1 by SBHA was closely involved in cell death in Calu-6 cells.",

The antiproliferative effect of PPARγ activation can be prevented by suppressing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) or β-oxidation of fatty acids in vitro and in vivo. Our proposed mechanism also suggests that metabolic changes can rapidly and directly inhibit cell-cycle progression of cancer cells by altering ROS levels.",

Current animal models of lung fibrosis have clear involvement of ROS in their pathogenesis. New classes of antioxidant agents divided into catalytic antioxidant mimetics and antioxidant scavengers are being developed. The catalytic antioxidant class is based on endogenous antioxidant enzymes and includes the manganese-containing macrocyclics, porphyrins, salens, and the non-metal-containing nitroxides. The antioxidant scavenging class is based on endogenous antioxidant molecules and includes the vitamin E analogues, thiols, lazaroids, and polyphenolic agents.

This study aimed to synthesize the AgNPs using the leaf extract of Artemisia princeps as a bio-reductant. Furthermore, we evaluated the multidimensional effect of the biologically synthesized AgNPs in Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter felis, and human lung (L132) and lung carcinoma (A549) cells. UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that the AgNPs are specifically indexed to a crystal structure. The results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicate that biomolecules are involved in the synthesis and stabilization of AgNPs. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies showed the average size distribution of the particle between 10 and 40 nm, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that the AgNPs were significantly well separated and spherical with an average size of 20 nm. AgNPs caused dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and biofilm formation and increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA fragmentation in H. pylori and H. felis. Furthermore, AgNPs induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in A549 cells; conversely, AgNPs had no significant effects on L132 cells. The results from this study suggest that AgNPs could cause cell-specific apoptosis in mammalian cells. Our findings demonstrate that this environmentally friendly method for the synthesis of AgNPs and that the prepared AgNPs have multidimensional effects such as anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activity against H. pylori and H. felis and also cytotoxic effects against human cancer cells. This report describes comprehensively the effects of AgNPs on bacteria and mammalian cells. We believe that biologically synthesized AgNPs will open a new avenue towards various biotechnological and biomedical applications in the near future. ",

We have previously reported that cigarette smoke (CS) activates reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) sensitive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling leading to induction of lung inflammation. Paeonol, the main phenolic compound present in the Chinese herb Paeonia suffruticosa, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether paeonol has similar beneficial effects against CS-induced lung inflammation remains unclear. Using a murine model, we showed that chronic CS exposure for 4 weeks caused pulmonary inflammatory infiltration, increased lung vascular permeability, elevated lung levels of chemokines, cytokines, and 4-hydroxynonenal (an oxidative stress biomarker), and induced lung inflammation; all of these CS-induced events were suppressed by chronic treatment with paeonol. Using human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), we demonstrated that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) sequentially increased extracellular and intracellular levels of ROS, activated the MAPKs/NF-κB signaling, and induced interleukin-8 (IL-8); all these CSE-induced events were inhibited by paeonol pretreatment. Our findings suggest a novel role for paeonol in alleviating the oxidative stress and lung inflammation induced by chronic CS exposure in vivo and in suppressing CSE-induced IL-8 in vitro via its antioxidant function and an inhibition of the MAPKs/NF-κB signaling.

However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in Cd pulmonary toxicity. In the present study, the effects of Cd exposure on human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) were evaluated by determination of lipid peroxidation, intra-cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and changes of mitochondrial membrane potential. A time- and dose-dependent increase of both lactate dehydrogenase leakage and malondialdehyde formation was observed in Cd-treated cells. A close correlation between these two events suggests that lipid peroxidation may be one of the main pathways causing its cytotoxicity. It was also noted that Cd-induced cell injury and lipid peroxidation were inhibited by catalase and superoxide dismutase, two antioxidant enzymes. By using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, a significant increase of ROS production in Cd-treated MRC-5 cells was detected. The inhibition of dichlorofluorescein fluorescence by catalase, not superoxide dismutase, suggests that hydrogen peroxide is the main ROS involved. Moreover, the significant dose-dependent changes of mitochondrial membrane potential in Cd-treated MRC-5 cells, demonstrated by increased fluorescence of rhodamine 123 examined using a laser-scanning confocal microscope, also indicate the involvement of mitochondrial damage in Cd cytotoxicity.

We evaluated the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in the lung and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pulmonary circulation using a fluorescent imaging technique.

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes accumulated in the lung during atelectasis, and p47-phox was translocated to the plasma membrane, but no ROS production was observed. Marked PMN ROS production was observed after reexpansion of the collapsed lung with air. Little ROS production was observed when the lung was reexpanded with nitrogen. During atelectasis, PMNs accumulate in the lung, where they are primed for respiratory bursting.

In contrast to previous reports, we have found that peroxisomes are present in all cell types in human and mouse lungs.

Whereas catalase showed significant differences between distinct cell types, Pex14p proved to be the marker of choice for labeling all lung peroxisomes. In alveolar type II cells and alveolar macrophages peroxisomes contained significant amounts of the lipid transporter ABCD3 and beta-oxidation enzymes, suggesting their involvement in the modification and recycling of surfactant lipids and in the control of lipid mediators and ligands for nuclear receptors of the PPAR family.

Additional experiments showed that BAY 41-2272 diminished PMA-induced ROS production by NADPH oxidase.

        "Doc_abstract":"Arsenic is a wide spread carcinogen associated with several kinds of cancers including skin, lung, bladder, and liver cancers. Lung is one of the major targets of arsenic exposure. Angiogenesis is the pivotal process during carcinogenesis and chronic pulmonary diseases, but the role and mechanism of arsenic in regulating angiogenesis remain to be elucidated. In this study we show that short time exposure of arsenic induces angiogenesis in both human immortalized lung epithelial cells BEAS-2B and adenocarcinoma cells A549. To study the molecular mechanism of arsenic-inducing angiogenesis, we find that arsenic induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which activates AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and increases the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of ROS production suppresses angiogenesis by decreasing AKT and ERK activation and HIF-1 expression. Inhibition of ROS, AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways is sufficient to attenuate arsenic-inducing angiogenesis. HIF-1 and VEGF are downstream effectors of AKT and ERK1/2 that are required for arsenic-inducing angiogenesis. These results shed light on the mechanism of arsenic in regulating angiogenesis, and are helpful to develop mechanism-based intervention to prevent arsenic-induced carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in the future.",

We isolated 2-ethoxycarbonyl-2-β-hydroxy-A-nor-cholest-5-ene-4one (ECHC) from butanol extracts of scleractinian coral Acropora formosa and reported its potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activity as well as less toxicity against zebrafish Danio rerio. In the present study, we intend to explore p53-mediated apoptosis pathway enhanced by ECHC in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. This report shows that ECHC increases ROS generation and sensitizes mitochondrial membrane that leads to the release of cytochrome C (Cyto C) into cytosol. Further, ECHC decreases the expression of antiapoptotic genes such as TNF-α, IL-8, Bcl2, MMP2, and MMP9 which are actively involved in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis etc. It also increases the expression of apoptotic genes Cyto C, Bax, and p21, which are responsible for cell cycle arrest and cell death. The tumor suppressor p53 was also observed to be upregulated during ECHC treatment in untransformed cells and was more likely to result in cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Finally, ECHC also down regulates the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 which are the death stage of intrinsic apoptosis. Our findings suggested that ECHC enhances ROS generation and mitochondrial sensitization determines the threshold for irreversible p53-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. ",

Particulate matter (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are two major pollutants derived from coal combustion processes and co-existing in coal-smoke air pollution, but their potentially synergistic toxicity remains elusive thus far. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic responses of PM10 and SO2, singly and in binary mixtures, using human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells, followed by clarifying the possible mechanisms for their interaction. The results indicated that the concomitant treatment of PM10 and SO2 at low concentrations led to synergistic injury in terms of cell survival and apoptosis occurrence, while PM10 and SO2 alone at the same concentrations did not cause damage to the cells. Also, radical oxygen species (ROS) production followed by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation was involved in the above synergistic cytotoxicity, which was confirmed by the repression of the actions by an ROS inhibitor (NAC). This implies that assessment of health risk should consider the interactions between ambient PM and gaseous copollutants. ",

We recently reported that it potently inhibits proliferation of various cancer cells. In this project, we investigated the effect of CLEFMA on gene expression profile in H441 lung adenocarcinoma cells, and studied its mechanism of action. In microarray data, we observed a deregulation of genes involved in redox and glutamate metabolism. Based on the affected ontologies, we hypothesized that antiproliferative activity of CLEFMA could be a result of the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We tested this hypothesis by determining the levels of glutathione (GSH) and ROS in H441 cells treated with CLEFMA. We observed a rapid depletion of intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio. Using a cell-permeable fluorogenic substrate, we found that CLEFMA significantly induced ROS in a time- and dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Flow-cytometry with a mitochondria-selective fluorescent reporter of ROS indicated that the CLEFMA-induced ROS was of mitochondrial origin. In contrast to the cancer cells, the normal lung fibroblasts (CCL-151) did not show any increase in ROS and were resistant to CLEFMA-induced cell death. Furthermore, the addition of antioxidants, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and N-acetylcysteine, rescued cancer cells from CLEFMA-induced cell death. Gene expression pathway analysis suggested that a transcription factor regulator Nrf2 is a pivotal molecule in the CLEFMA-induced deregulation of redox pathways. The immunoblotting of Nrf2 showed that CLEFMA treatment resulted in phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in a time-dependent fashion. Based on these results, we conclude that induction of ROS is critical for the antiproliferative activity of CLEFMA and the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response fails to salvage H441 cells.",

Treatment with MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells with an IC(50) of approximately 20 microM at 24 hours.

        "Doc_abstract":"Tea is a popular beverage. The consumption of green tea is associated with a lower risk of several types of cancer, including stomach, esophagus, and lung. The cancer chemopreventive effect of tea has been attributed to its major phytopolyphenols. The tea polyphenols comprise about one-third of the weight of the dried leaf, and they show profound biochemical and pharmacological activities including antioxidant activities, modulation of carcinogen metabolism, inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. They intervene in the biochemical and molecular processes of multistep carcinogenesis, comprising tumor initiation, promotion, and progression. Several studies demonstrate that most tea polyphenols exert their scavenging effects against reactive oxygen species (ROS); excessive production of ROS has been implicated for the development of cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Recently, we have found that the major tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) suppresses extracellular signals and cell proliferation through epidermal growth factor receptor binding in human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells; EGCG also blocks the induction of nitric oxide synthase by down-regulating lipopolysaccharide-induced activity of the transcription factor NFKB in macrophages. Furthermore, EGCG blocks the cell cycle at the G1 phase in MCF-7 cells. We have demonstrated that EGCG inhibits the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4; meanwhile, EGCG induces the expression of the Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27. These results suggest that tumor promotion can be enhanced by ROS and oxidative mitotic signal transduction, and this enhancement can be suppressed by EGCG or other tea polyphenols.",

However, when its availability is not adequately controlled, iron, can catalyze the formation of a range of aggressive and damaging reactive oxygen species, and act as a microbial growth promoter. Depending on the concentrations formed such species can cause molecular damage or influence redox signaling mechanisms. This review describes recent knowledge concerning iron metabolism in the lung, during both health and disease. In the lower part of the lung a small redox active pool of iron is required for reasons that are at present unclear, but may be related to antimicrobial functions. When the concentration of iron is increased in the lung (usually because of environmental exposure), iron is deleterious and contributes to a range of chronic and acute respiratory diseases. Moreover, aberrant regulation of iron metabolism, and/or deficient antioxidant protection, is also associated with acute lung diseases, such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Iron, with the consequent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), microbial growth promotion, and adverse signaling is strongly implicated as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of numerous disease processes involving the lung. Heme oxgenase, an enzyme that produces reactive iron from heme catabolism, is also briefly discussed in relation to lung disease.",

We have investigated the significance of the particle surface reactivity of respirable quartz dust in relation to the in vivo generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and the associated induction of oxidative stress responses in the lung. Therefore, rats were intratracheally instilled with 2 mg quartz (DQ12) or quartz whose surface was modified by either polyvinylpyridine-N-oxide (PVNO) or aluminium lactate (AL). Seven days after instillation, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analysed for markers of inflammation (total/differential cell counts), levels of pulmonary oxidants (H2O2, nitrite), antioxidant status (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), as well as for markers of lung tissue damage, e.g. total protein, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. Lung homogenates as well as sections were investigated regarding the induction of the oxidative DNA-lesion/oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) using HPLC/ECD analysis and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Homogenates and sections were also investigated for the expression of the bifunctional apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 (APE/Ref-1) by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Significantly increased levels of H2O2 and nitrite were observed in rats treated with non-coated quartz, when compared to rats that were treated with either saline or the surface-modified quartz preparations. In the BALF, there was a strong correlation between the number of macrophages and ROS, as well as total cells and RNS. Although enhanced oxidant generation in non-coated DQ12-treated rats was paralleled with an increased total antioxidant capacity in the BALF, these animals also showed significantly enhanced lung tissue damage. Remarkably however, elevated ROS levels were not associated with an increase in 8-OHdG, whereas the lung tissue expression of APE/Ref-1 protein was clearly up-regulated. The present data provide further in vivo evidence for the crucial role of particle surface properties in quartz dust-induced ROS/RNS generation by recruited inflammatory phagocytes. Our results also demonstrate that quartz dust can fail to show steady-state enhanced oxidative DNA damage in the respiratory tract, in conditions were it elicits a marked and persistent inflammation with associated generation of ROS/RNS, and indicate that this may relate to compensatory induction of APE/Ref-1 mediated base excision repair.",

Growing evidence suggests that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) could play a pivotal role in various respiratory diseases; however, it remains unclear whether EndMT participates in the injury/repair process of septic acute lung injury. Here, we analyzed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice whose total number of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (PVECs) transiently decreased after production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the population of EndMT-PVECs significantly increased. NAD(P)H oxidase inhibition suppressed EndMT of PVECs. Most EndMT-PVECs derived from tissue-resident cells, not from bone marrow, as assessed by mice with chimeric bone marrow. Bromodeoxyuridine-incorporation assays revealed higher proliferation of capillary EndMT-PVECs. In addition, EndMT-PVECs strongly expressed c-kit and CD133. LPS loading to human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-Ls) induced reversible EndMT, as evidenced by phenotypic recovery observed after removal of LPS. LPS-induced EndMT-HMVEC-Ls had increased vasculogenic ability, aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and expression of drug resistance genes, which are also fundamental properties of progenitor cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LPS induces EndMT of tissue-resident PVECs during the early phase of acute lung injury, partly mediated by ROS, contributing to increased proliferation of PVECs.

We determined whether the catechins supplement may reduce cooking-oil-fumes-induced acute lung injury in rat. In the urethane-anesthetized Wistar rat subjected to 30-120 min of cooking-oil-fumes exposure, blood ROS significantly increased in the recovery stage. After 30-min cooking-oil-fumes exposure, the enhanced blood ROS level further increased in a time-dependent manner during the recovery stage (321 +/- 69 counts/10 s after 1 h, 540 +/- 89 counts/10 s after 2 h, and 873 +/- 112 counts/10 s after 4 h). Four hours after 30-min cooking-oil-fumes exposure, lung lavage neutrophils and ROS as well as lung tissue dityrosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal increased significantly. Two weeks of catechins supplememnt significantly reduced the enhanced lavage ROS, lung dityrosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal level. Cooking-oil-fumes-induced oxidative stress decreased lung Bcl-2/Bax ratio and HSP70 expression, but catechins treatment preserved the downregulation of Bcl-2/Bax ratio and HSP70 expression.

Moreover, morphological changes associated with apoptosis were examined using double staining with Hoechst 33258-propidium iodide (PI). The results showed that ACL was much more cytotoxic than DOX in all investigated cell lines. Furthermore, ACL induced a concentration- and time-dependent increase in ROS production and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. The drugs, especially ACL, also induced ROS mediated apoptosis and necrosis pathways in all cell lines depending on the length of the post-treatment time. All these processes were partially inhibited by the antioxidants: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and alpha-tocopherol. Of both drugs, DOX caused considerably weaker depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Its 10-fold higher concentration, as compared to ACL, was required to induce a similar effect, in accordance with the highly distinct cytotoxicity of these drugs towards investigated cells. In conclusion, ROS production preceded a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, but only changes in DeltaPsim were correlated with drug cytotoxicity in particular cell line.

Alveolar macrophages or lung epithelial cells exposed to BLM revealed the loss of cell viability and increase in caspase-3 activity. Ambroxol (10-100 microM) reduced the 75 mU/mL BLM-induced cell death and activation of caspase-3 in macrophages or epithelial cells. It reduced the condensation and fragmentation of nuclei caused by BLM in macrophages. Ambroxol alone did not significantly cause cell death. Treatment of alveolar macrophages with BLM resulted in the decrease in transmembrane potential in mitochondria, cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c, increase in formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of GSH. Ambroxol (10-100 microM) inhibited the increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability, ROS formation and decrease in GSH contents due to BLM in macrophages. Ambroxol exerted a scavenging effect on hydroxyl radicals and nitric oxide and reduced the iron-mediated formation of malondialdehyde and carbonyls in liver mitochondria. It prevented cell death due to SIN-1 in lung epithelial cells. The results demonstrate that ambroxol attenuates the BLM-induced viability loss in alveolar macrophages or lung epithelial cells.

Based on reports of a mechanosensory complex that includes platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and initiates signaling with mechanical force, we hypothesized that PECAM-1 could serve as a mechanosensor in sensing disruption of flow.

Lack of PECAM-1 did not affect NOX2 activation machinery or the caveolin-1 expression or caveolae number in the pulmonary endothelium. Stop of flow in vitro triggered an increase in angiogenic potential of WT pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC) but not of PECAM-1(-/-) PMVEC. Obstruction of flow in lungs in vivo showed that the neutrophil infiltration as observed in WT mice was significantly lowered in PECAM-1(-/-) mice. With stop of flow, WT lungs showed higher expression of the angiogenic marker VEGF compared with untreated (sham) and PECAM-1(-/-) lungs. Thus PECAM-1 (and caveolae) are parts of the mechanosensing machinery that generates superoxide with loss of shear; the resultant ROS potentially drives neutrophil influx and acts as an angiogenic signal.

However, the influence of galangin on human renal cancer cells remains to be elucidated. In the present study, proliferation of 786‑0 and Caki‑1 cells was suppressed following exposure to various doses of galangin. Cell invasion and wound healing assays were used to observe the effect of galangin on invasion and migration. The results demonstrated that Galangin inhibited cell invasion by suppressing the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), with an increase in the expression of E‑cadherin and decreased expression levels of N‑cadherin and vimentin. The apoptosis induced by galangin was analyzed by flow cytometry. The results revealed that galangin induced apoptosis in a dose‑dependent manner. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important contributing factor for the apoptosis of various types of cancer cell. The dichlorofluorescein-diacetate method was used to determine the level of ROS. Galangin induced the accumulation of intracellular ROS and malondialdehyde, and decreased the activities of total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase in renal cell carcinoma cells. Galangin exerted an antiproliferative effect and inhibited renal cell carcinoma invasion by suppressing the EMT. This treatment also induced apoptosis, accompanied by the production of ROS. Therefore, the present data suggested that galangin may have beneficial effects by preventing renal cell carcinoma growth, inhibiting cell invasion via the EMT and inducing cell apoptosis. ",

Similar data were obtained in other GU tumor cells. Combination of these two agents resulted in increased autophagy that was dependent on expression of ceramide synthase 6, with HDACIs enhancing MDA-7/IL-24 toxicity by increasing generation of ROS and Ca (2+). Knock down of CD95 protected cells from HDACI and MDA-7/IL-24 lethality. Sorafenib treatment further enhanced (HDACI + MDA-7/IL-24) lethality. Anoikis resistant renal carcinoma cells were more sensitive to MDA-7/IL-24 that correlated with elevated SRC activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD95. We employed a recently constructed serotype 5/3 adenovirus, which is more effective than a serotype 5 virus in delivering mda- 7/IL-24 to renal carcinoma cells and which conditionally replicates (CR) in tumor cells expressing MDA-7/IL-24 by virtue of placing the adenoviral E1A gene under the control of the cancer-specific promoter progression elevated gene-3 (Ad.5/3-PEG-E1A-mda-7; CRAd.5/3-mda-7, Ad.5/3-CTV), to define efficacy in renal carcinoma cells. Ad.5/3-CTV decreased the growth of renal carcinoma tumors to a significantly greater extent than did a non-replicative virus Ad.5/3-mda-7. In contralateral uninfected renal carcinoma tumors Ad.5/3-CTV also decreased the growth of tumors to a greater extent than did Ad.5/3-mda-7. In summation, our data demonstrates that HDACIs enhance MDA-7/IL-24-mediated toxicity and tumor specific adenoviral delivery and viral replication of mda-7/IL-24 is an effective pre-clinical renal carcinoma therapeutic.

Yet, it is well established that most anticancer therapies depend on ROS production for efficient tumor eradication. Using several non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, we have dissected how the site of ROS production and accumulation in various cell compartments affect cell fate. We demonstrate that high levels of exogenously generated H2O2 induce extensive DNA damage, ATP depletion, and severe cytotoxicity. Although these effects were independent of caspase activity, they could-at least in part-be prevented by RIP1 kinase inhibition. In contrast, low levels of exogenously produced H2O2 triggered a modest drop in ATP level, delayed toxicity, G2/M arrest, and cell senescence. Mitochondrially produced H2O2 induced a reversible ATP drop without affecting cell viability. Instead, the cells accumulated in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and became senescent. Concomitant inhibition of glycolysis was found to markedly sensitize cells to death in the presence of otherwise nontoxic concentrations of H2O2, presumably by the inhibition of ATP-restoring mechanisms. Combined, our data provide evidence that ROS might dictate different cellular consequences depending on their overall concentration at steady-state levels and on their site of generation.",

NAMPT, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the immediate precursor of NAD, is an attractive therapeutic target as inhibition of NAMPT reduces cellular NAD levels and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. However, there is limited understanding of the metabolic response to NAD depletion across cancer cell lines and whether all cell lines respond in a uniform manner. To explore this we selected two non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines that are sensitive to the NAMPT inhibitor GNE-617 (A549, NCI-H1334), one that shows intermediate sensitivity (NCI-H441), and one that is insensitive (LC-KJ). Even though NAD was reduced in all cell lines there was surprising heterogeneity in their metabolic response. Both sensitive cell lines reduced glycolysis and levels of di- and tri-nucleotides and modestly increased oxidative phosphorylation, but they differed in their ability to combat oxidative stress. H1334 cells activated the stress kinase AMPK, whereas A549 cells were unable to activate AMPK as they contain a mutation in LKB1, which prevents activation of AMPK. However, A549 cells increased utilization of the Pentose Phosphate pathway (PPP) and had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels than H1334 cells, indicating that A549 cells are better able to modulate an increase in oxidative stress. Inherent resistance of LC-KJ cells is associated with higher baseline levels of NADPH and a delayed reduction of NAD upon NAMPT inhibition. Our data reveals that cell lines show heterogeneous response to NAD depletion and that the underlying molecular and genetic framework in cells can influence the metabolic response to NAMPT inhibition.",

However, the mechanism through which lung fluid conductance is altered during malaria remains unclear. To define the role that the scavenger receptor CD36 may play in mediating this response, C57BL/6J (WT) and CD36-/- mice were infected with P. berghei ANKA and monitored for changes in pulmonary endothelial barrier function employing an isolated perfused lung system. WT lungs demonstrated a >10-fold increase in two measures of paracellular fluid conductance and a decrease in the albumin reflection coefficient (σalb) compared to control lungs indicating a loss of barrier function. In contrast, malaria-infected CD36-/- mice had near normal fluid conductance but a similar reduction in σalb. In WT mice, lung sequestered iRBCs demonstrated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To determine whether knockout of CD36 could protect against ROS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, mouse lung microvascular endothelial monolayers (MLMVEC) from WT and CD36-/- mice were exposed to H2O2. Unlike WT monolayers, which showed dose-dependent decreases in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) from H2O2 indicating loss of barrier function, CD36-/- MLMVEC demonstrated dose-dependent increases in TER. The differences between responses in WT and CD36-/- endothelial cells correlated with important differences in the intracellular compartmentalization of the CD36-associated Fyn kinase. Malaria infection increased total lung Fyn levels in CD36-/- lungs compared to WT, but this increase was due to elevated production of the inactive form of Fyn further suggesting a dysregulation of Fyn-mediated signaling. The importance of Fyn in CD36-dependent endothelial signaling was confirmed using in vitro Fyn knockdown as well as Fyn-/- mice, which were also protected from H2O2- and malaria-induced lung endothelial leak, respectively. Our results demonstrate that CD36 and Fyn kinase are critical mediators of the increased lung endothelial fluid conductance caused by malaria infection. ",

We investigated the effects of SAHA in a human lung-derived carcinoma cell line (H292). We analysed cell viability and cycle; oxidative stress markers; mitochondrial integrity; HSP60 protein and mRNA levels; and HSP60 post-translational modifications, and its secretion. We found that SAHA is cytotoxic for H292 cells, interrupting the cycle at the G2/M phase, which is followed by death; cytotoxicity is associated with oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and diminution of intracellular levels of HSP60; HSP60 undergoes a post-translational modification and becomes nitrated; and nitrated HSP60 is exported via exosomes. We propose that SAHA causes ROS overproduction and mitochondrial dysfunction, which leads to HSP60 nitration and release into the intercellular space and circulation to interact with the immune system. These successive steps might constitute the mechanism of the anti-tumor action of SAHA and provide a basis to design supplementary therapeutic strategies targeting HSP60, which would be more efficacious than the compound alone.

We have shown that cisplatin-resistant tumors have higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and can be exploited for targeted therapy. Here, we show that increased secretion of the antioxidant thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) resulted in lowered intracellular TRX1 and contributed to higher ROS in cisplatin-resistant tumors in vivo and in vitro. By reconstituting TRX1 protein in cisplatin-resistant cells, we increased sensitivity to cisplatin but decreased sensitivity to elesclomol (ROS inducer). Conversely, decreased TRX1 protein in parental cells reduced the sensitivity to cisplatin but increased sensitivity to elesclomol. Cisplatin-resistant cells had increased endogenous oxygen consumption and mitochondrial activity but decreased lactic acid production. They also exhibited higher levels of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and fumarase mRNA, which contributed to oxidative metabolism (OXMET) when compared with parental cells. Restoring intracellular TRX1 protein in cisplatin-resistant cells resulted in lowering ASS and fumarase mRNAs, which in turn sensitized them to arginine deprivation. Interestingly, cisplatin-resistant cells also had significantly higher basal levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Overexpressing TRX1 lowered ACC and FAS proteins expressions in cisplatin-resistant cells. Chemical inhibition and short interfering RNA of ACC resulted in significant cell death in cisplatin-resistant compared with parental cells. Conversely, TRX1 overexpressed cisplatin-resistant cells resisted 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA)-induced death. Collectively, lowering TRX1 expression through increased secretion leads cisplatin-resistant cells to higher ROS production and increased dependency on OXMET.

Murine lung epithelial (LA-4) cells and BALB/c mice were treated with a cytokine mixture (cytomix: TNFα, IL-1β, and IFNγ) to induce a generic inflammatory state. Cells were exposed to saline or DEP (25 μg/cm(2)) and examined for differential effects on redox balance and cytotoxicity. Likewise, mice undergoing nose-only inhalation exposure to air or DEP (2 mg/m(3) × 4 h/d × 2 d) were assessed for differential effects on lung inflammation, injury, antioxidant levels, and phagocyte ROS production.;Cytomix treatment significantly increased LA-4 cell NO production though iNOS activation. Cytomix +  DEP-exposed cells incurred the greatest intracellular ROS production, with commensurate cytotoxicity, as these cells were unable to maintain redox balance. By contrast, saline + DEP-exposed cells were able to mount effective antioxidant responses. DEP effects were mediated by: (1) increased ROS including superoxide anion (O(2)(·-)), related to increased xanthine dehydrogenase expression and reduced cytosolic superoxide dismutase activity; and (2) increased peroxynitrite generation related to interaction of O(2)(·-) with cytokine-induced NO. Effects were partially reduced by superoxide dismutase (SOD) supplementation or by blocking iNOS induction. In mice, cytomix +  DEP-exposure resulted in greater ROS production in lung phagocytes. Phagocyte and epithelial effects were, by and large, prevented by treatment with FeTMPyP, which accelerates peroxynitrite catalysis.;During inflammation, due to interactions of NO and O(2)(·-), DEP-exposure was associated with nitrosative stress in surface epithelial cells and resident lung phagocytes. As these cell types work in concert to provide protection against inhaled pathogens and allergens, dysfunction would predispose to development of respiratory infection and allergy.

This protective program has been shown to reduce carcinogenesis triggered by chemical and physical insults. However, it is also hijacked by established cancers to thrive and proliferate within the hostile tumor microenvironment and to gain resistance against chemo- and radiotherapies. Therefore, targeting the AOS response proteins that are exploited by cancer cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy. In order to identify the AOS genes that are suspected to support cancer progression and resistance, we analyzed the expression patterns of 285 genes annotated for being involved in oxidative stress in 994 tumors and 353 normal tissues. Thereby we identified a signature of 116 genes that are highly overexpressed in multiple carcinomas while being only minimally expressed in normal tissues. To establish which of these genes are more likely to functionally drive cancer resistance and progression, we further identified those whose overexpression correlates with negative patient outcome in breast and lung carcinoma. Gene-set enrichment, GO, network, and pathway analyses revealed that members of the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways are prominent components of this oncogenic signature and that activation of these pathways is common feature of many cancer entities. Interestingly, a large fraction of these AOS genes are downstream targets of the transcription factors NRF2, NF-kappaB and FOXM1, and relay on NADPH for their enzymatic activities highlighting promising drug targets. We discuss these findings and propose therapeutic strategies that may be applied to overcome cancer resistance. ",

However, little is known about the potential of new systems, designed for more efficient and targeted doxorubicin delivery (i.e. protein conjugates, polymeric micelles, liposomes, monoclonal antibodies), to induce oxidative stress (OS) in tumors and hematological malignancies. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine the relation between the toxicity of doxorubicin-transferring (DOX-TRF) conjugate and its capability to generate oxidative/nitrosative stress in solid tumor cells. Our research proves that DOX-TRF conjugate displays higher cytotoxicity towards lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (A549) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines than the reference free drug (DOX) and induces more extensive OS, characterized by a significant decrease in the total cellular antioxidant capacity, glutathione level and amount of -SH groups and an increase in hydroperoxide content. The intracellular redox imbalance was accompanied by changes in the transcription of genes encoding key antioxidant enzymes engaged in the sustaining of cellular redox homeostasis: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GP).

Some studies suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) by isoflurane play a crucial role for anesthetic-induced protective effects on the brain or the heart; however, it still remains controversial. In this study, we examined the role of isoflurane-derived ROS in isoflurane-induced inhibition of lung injury and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation in LPS-challenged rat lungs.;Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to inhalation of 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane for 60 minutes, and intratracheal LPS 0.1 mg was administered 60 minutes later. In some cases, ROS scavenger, 2-mercaptopropinyl glycine or N-acetylcysteine was given 30 minutes before isoflurane. ROS generation was measured by fluorometer before LPS challenge and 4 hours after. Isoflurane's preconditioning effect was assessed by histologic examination, protein content, neutrophil recruitment, and determination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Western blotting measured phosphorylation of inhibitory κB α (ser 32/36), NFκB p65, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression and immunofluorescence staining for iNOS were also assessed.;Isoflurane preconditioning reduced inflammatory lung injury and TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 release in the lung. Isoflurane upregulated ROS generation before LPS but inhibited a ROS burst after LPS challenge. ROS scavenger administration before isoflurane abolished the isoflurane preconditioning effect as well as isoflurane-induced inhibition of phosphorylation of inhibitory κBα, NFκB p65, iNOS activation, and mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in acute LPS-challenged lungs.;This study suggests a crucial role of upregulated ROS generation by isoflurane for modification of inflammatory pathways by isoflurane preconditioning in acute inflammation of the lung.",

Little or no change in the ADM sensitivity of parent cells is brought about by concentrations of VRP up to 15-20 microM. In the resistant line, a dose-related effect of VRP is seen with little effect below 1.0 microM and a gradual loss of resistance at higher doses.

In oral carcinoma cells, p62/SQSTM1 knockdown did not affect the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway but did significantly reduce GSH content with subsequent ROS accumulation, and caused cell growth inhibition in the irradiated condition. Finally, p62/SQSTM1 excess was associated with poor prognosis in a clinical cohort. In oral epithelial carcinogenesis, p62/SQSTM1 excess played a role in GSH induction rather than Nrf2 accumulation, and may cause resistance to cytotoxic stresses such as radiation or chemotherapy.

ROS are very reactive with biological molecules such as lipids, proteins and DNA, potentially resulting in cell dysfunction and tissue insult. Excessive NADPH oxidase activation and ROS overproduction are believed to participate in disorders such as joint, lung, vascular and intestinal inflammation. NADPH oxidase is a complex enzyme composed of six proteins: gp91phox (renamed NOX2), p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox and Rac1/2. Inhibitors of this enzyme could be beneficial, by limiting ROS production and inappropriate inflammation. A few small non-peptide inhibitors of NADPH oxidase are currently used to inhibit ROS production, but they lack specificity as they inhibit NADPH oxidase homologues or other unrelated enzymes. Peptide inhibitors that target a specific sequence of NADPH oxidase components could be more specific than small molecules. Here we review peptide-based inhibitors, with particular focus on a molecule derived from gp91phox/NOX2 and p47phox, and discuss their possible use as specific phagocyte NADPH oxidase inhibitors.",

Previous studies indicate that CFTR regulates cellular glutathione (GSH) transport and that dysfunctional CFTR is associated with chronic pulmonary oxidative stress. The cause and the source of this oxidative stress remain unknown. The current study examines the role of the mitochondria in CFTR-mediated pulmonary oxidative stress. Mitochondrial GSH levels and markers of DNA and protein oxidation were assessed in the lung mitochondria from CFTR-knockout mice. In addition, in vitro models using human CFTR-sufficient and -deficient lung epithelial cells were also employed. Mitochondrial GSH levels were found to be decreased up to 85% in CFTR-knockout mice, and 43% in human lung epithelial cells deficient in CFTR. A concomitant 29% increase in the oxidation of mitochondrial DNA, and a 30% loss of aconitase activity confirmed the existence of a mitochondrial oxidative stress. Flow cytometry revealed significantly elevated levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CFTR-deficient human lung cells. These studies suggest that dysfunctional CFTR leads to an increase in the level of ROS and mitochondrial oxidative stress. This oxidative stress, however, appears to be a consequence of lower mitochondrial GSH levels and not increased oxidation of GSH. Further studies are needed to determine how CFTR deficiency contributes to mitochondrial oxidative stress and the role this plays in CFTR-mediated lung pathophysiology.",

In previous studies, fast binding to albumin as well as transferrin could be shown. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is diversely being exploited for tumor targeting, could therefore be applicable for NKP-1339. Here we studied the serum dependence of its biological activity in various methods, influencing its cellular accumulation, cytotoxicity as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS lead to Nrf2 activation, which is known to activate antioxidant response gene transcription. GRP78 down-regulation on the protein level suggests ER associated protein degradation (ERAD) as a mode of action, as RNA levels are only mildly affected. Another important part for the mode of action is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as different factors are highly upregulated on the protein level. For example PERK, a transmembrane receptor which is released by GRP78 when the ER is disturbed, is upregulated and phosphorylated. EIF2α is phosphorylated, which leads to an inhibition of CAP-dependent translation and other stress responses. The transcription factor CHOP (DDIT3), which promotes ER stress dependent apoptosis, is time and concentration dependently upregulated. Finally cytotoxicity tests could prove that inhibition of ER stress and ER stress-mediated apoptosis leads to decreased cytotoxic effects of NKP-1339, which highlights the involvement of this mechanism in the mode of action.

In this study, changes in lung mitochondrial morphology, expression of mitochondrial fission/fusion markers, lipid peroxidation, and transport ATPase activity in SD rats exposed to ambient PM2.5 at different dosages were investigated. Also, the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the respiratory burst in rat alveolar macrophages (AMs) exposed to PM2.5 was examined by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (CL). The results showed that (1) PM2.5 deposited in the lung and induced pathological damage, particularly causing abnormal alterations of mitochondrial structure, including mitochondrial swelling and cristae disorder or even fragmentation in the presence of higher doses of PM2.5; (2) PM2.5 significantly affected the expression of specific mitochondrial fission/fusion markers (OPA1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Fis1, and Drp1) in rat lung; (3) PM2.5 inhibited Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), Na(+)K(+)-ATPase, and Ca(2+)-ATPase activities and elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) content in rat lung mitochondria; and (4) PM2.5 induced rat AMs to produce ROS, which was inhibited by about 84.1% by diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), an important ROS generation inhibitor. It is suggested that the pathological injury observed in rat lung exposed to PM2.5 is associated with mitochondrial fusion-fission dysfunction, ROS generation, mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, and cellular homeostasis imbalance.

The mechanisms of PM-mediated lung pathophysiology, however, remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that PM, via enhanced oxidative stress, disrupts lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity, thereby enhancing organ dysfunction. Using PM collected from Ft. McHenry Tunnel (Baltimore, MD), we assessed PM-mediated changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) (a highly sensitive measure of barrier function), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in human pulmonary artery EC. PM induced significant dose (10-100 microg/ml)- and time (0-10 h)-dependent EC barrier disruption reflected by reduced TER values. Exposure of human lung EC to PM resulted in significant ROS generation, which was directly involved in PM-mediated EC barrier dysfunction, as N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, 5 mM) pretreatment abolished both ROS production and barrier disruption induced by PM. Furthermore, PM induced p38 MAPK activation and HSP27 phosphorylation, events that were both attenuated by NAC. In addition, PM-induced EC barrier disruption was partially prevented by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (10 microM) as well as by reduced expression of either p38 MAPK beta or HSP27 (siRNA). These results demonstrate that PM induces ROS generation in human lung endothelium, resulting in oxidative stress-mediated EC barrier disruption via p38 MAPK- and HSP27-dependent pathways. These findings support a novel mechanism for PM-induced lung dysfunction and adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes.",

Nevertheless, evidence from rodent studies show that biopersistent engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) stimulate immune, inflammatory, and fibroproliferative responses in the lung, suggesting possible risks for lung diseases or systemic immune disorders as a consequence of occupational, environmental, or consumer exposure. Due to their nanoscale dimensions and increased surface area per unit mass, ENMs have a much greater potential to reach the distal regions of the lung and generate ROS. High aspect ratio ENMs (e.g., nanotubes, nanofibers) activate inflammasomes in macrophages, triggering IL-1β release and neutrophilic infiltration into the lungs. Moreover, some ENMs alter allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation by immunostimulation, immunosuppression, or modulating the balance between Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, thereby influencing the nature of the inflammatory response. ENMs also migrate from the lungs across epithelial, endothelial, or mesothelial barriers to stimulate or suppress systemic immune responses.",

The cytotoxic activities were determined using MTT assay. The apoptotic cell death was examined using Flow cytometry using PI staining and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. The activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were measured using ELISA. Intracellular ROS was measured by FCM using the fluorescent probe DCHF-DA, and the expression of DR4, DR5, CHOP, GPR78, and ATF4 proteins was analyzed using Western blot.;Our results demonstrated subtoxic concentrations of DMF sensitize HCC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and induce the death receptor 5 (DR5) expression level, accompanying the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of CHOP, GPR78, and ATF4 protein expression. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited DMF-induced upregulation of DR5, CHOP, GPR78, and ATF4 protein expression and blocked the cotreatment-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, DMF-mediated sensitization of HCC cells to TRAIL was reduced by administration of a blocking antibody or small interfering RNAs for DR5, salubrinal, an inhibitor of ER stress, and the small interfering RNAs for CHOP. However, DMF could not induce the upregulation of DR5 expression, generation of ROS, and sensitization of TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death in human embryo liver L-02 cells or normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).;The present study demonstrates that DMF selectively enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by ROS-stimulated ER-stress triggering CHOP-mediated DR5 upregulation in HCC.",

Although there are some reports about the cytotoxicity of nSiO2, the association between physical and chemical properties of nSiO2s and their cellular effects is still unclear. In this study, we examined the correlation between the physiochemical properties and cellular effects of three kinds of amorphous nSiO2s; sub-micro-scale amorphous SiO2, and micro-scale amorphous and crystalline SiO2 particles. The SiO2 particles were dispersed in culture medium and applied to HaCaT human keratinocytes and A549 human lung carcinoma cells. nSiO2s showed stronger protein adsorption than larger SiO2 particles. Moreover, the cellular effects of SiO2 particles were independent of the particle size and crystalline phase. The extent of cell membrane damage and intracellular ROS levels were different among nSiO2s. Upon exposure to nSiO2s, some cells released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), whereas another nSiO2 did not induce LDH release. nSiO2s caused a slight increase in intracellular ROS levels. These cellular effects were independent of the specific surface area and primary particle size of the nSiO2s. Additionally, association of solubility and protein adsorption ability of nSiO2 to its cellular effects seemed to be small. Taken together, our data suggest that nSiO2s do not exert potent cytotoxic effects on cells in culture, especially compared to the effects of micro-scale SiO2 particles. Further studies are needed to address the role of surface properties of nSiO2s on cellular processes and cytotoxicity.",

The large toad Rhinella marina is common in the cleared tropical forests of the Iquitos region and is regarded as poisonous. The venom from two different populations of R. marina was collected in the Departamento de Loreto, Perú. The samples were assessed for antiproliferative effect and composition. Some 29 compounds were identified or tentatively identified from the venom by spectroscopic and spectrometric means. The main free bufadienolide was marinobufagin 7 while marinobufotoxin 15 and bufalitoxin 9 were the main bufadienolide argininyl diacid derivatives. The alkaloids dehydrobufotenin 28 and bufotenidin 29 were present in both venoms. The main difference in the venoms was the relative ratio of argininyl diacids from bufadienolides to free bufadienolides. The argininyl diacids included derivatives from bufalin, marinobufagin, telocinobufagin, hellebrigenin, resibufogenin and bufotalinin. Four compounds, including undecadienoyl aginine 6 and three argininyl diacids from bufadienolides were tentatively identified for the first time in the samples. The venom showed a strong antiproliferative effect towards MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts (0.063-0.247 μg/mL), AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (0.076-0.272 μg/mL), SK-MES-1 human lung cancer cells (0.154-0.296 μg/mL), J82 human bladder carcinoma cells (0.169-0.212 μg/mL), and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia (0.071-0.283 μg/mL). The antiproliferative effect is mediated by ROS production and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231).

In this study, we investigated whether arsenite induces expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, composed of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta/ARNT subunits; and is involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Here we demonstrate that arsenite induces the expression of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-1beta subunit in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells. Arsenite also increases the expression of VEGF through the induction of HIF-1. We also found that arsenite activates PI3K and Akt that are required for arsenite-induced expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF. The induction of HIF-1 and VEGF by arsenite can not be inhibited by MAP kinase inhibitors. Arsenite causes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The major species of ROS required for the induction of HIF-1 and VEGF is H2O2.

We tested whether previous exposure to an acidic environment alters metastatic potential of two rat carcinoma cell lines in the animal model. In addition, we determined the effect of an acidic environment on motility and invasive capacity of AT-1 prostate carcinoma cells in culture. Exposure of tumor cells to an acidic environment (pH 6.6, 5 % CO2, 6 h) prior to tail vein injection in rats enhanced formation of lung metastases significantly. In culture, acidosis increased cellular motility of AT-1 cells. When the tumor cells were transferred back to pH 7.4, enhanced motility persisted for at least 3 h but vanished after longer periods (24 h), therefore presenting a \"short-term memory effect.\" Although acidosis augmented phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38, and inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation or of p38 kinase activity reduced basal motility at pH 7.4, acidosis-induced increase in motility was not dependent on ERK1/2 or p38 kinase. Src family kinases were not involved either. By contrast, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), known to be increased in AT-1 cells under acidic conditions, blunted acidosis-induced motility increase. Our data indicate that tumor cells may acquire enhanced motility in an acidic micromilieu, at least in part due to enhanced ROS formation. Because enhanced motility persists for at least 3 h after leaving the acidic environment, this may promote metastasis formation, as observed in our in vivo model.",

As a result, it was possible to overcome the unfavorable pharmacokinetic and short pharmacological properties of Trx. We hypothesized that HSA-Trx would attenuate the enhanced ROS production of species such as hydroxyl radicals by neutrophils during an influenza viral infection. The levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 3-nitrotyrosine were used as indices of the anti-oxidant activity of HSA-Trx. In addition, the cytoprotective effects of HSA-Trx were examined in PR8 (H1N1) influenza virus-induced lung injured mice. The findings show that HSA-Trx reduced the number of total cells, neutrophils, and total protein in BALF of influenza virus-induced lung injured mice. The HSA-Trx treatment significantly decreased the level of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 3-nitrotyrosine, but failed to inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, in the lungs of the virus-infected mice. On the other hand, Tamiflu(®) treatment also significantly suppressed the production of inflammatory cells and neutrophil infiltration, as well as the protein level in BALF and lung histopathological alterations caused by the influenza virus. The suppressive effect of Tamiflu(®) was slightly stronger than that of HSA-Trx. Interestingly, Tamiflu(®) significantly decreased virus proliferation, while HSA-Trx had no effect. These results indicate that HSA-Trx may be of therapeutic value for the treatment of various acute inflammatory disorders such as influenza-virus-induced pneumonia, by inhibiting inflammatory-cell responses and suppressing the overproduction of NO in the lung.

We aimed to identify the clinicoradiologic predictors of tumors with ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1), or RET (rearranged during transfection) fusions in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.A total of 539 pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinomas were included in this retrospective study. The baseline clinicopathologic characteristics were retrieved from the patients' medical records and the ALK/ROS1/RET fusion status was reviewed. Quantitative computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography imaging characteristics were evaluated using a radiomics approach. Significant features for the fusion-positive tumor prediction model were extracted from all of the clinicoradiologic features, and were used to calculate diagnostic performance for predicting 3 fusions' positivity. The clinicoradiologic features were compared between ALK versus ROS1/RET fusion-positive tumors to identify the clinicoradiologic similarity between the 2 groups.The fusion-positive tumor prediction model was a combination of younger age, advanced tumor stage, solid tumor on CT, higher values for SUV(max) and tumor mass, lower values for kurtosis and inverse variance on 3-voxel distance than those of fusion-negative tumors (sensitivity and specificity, 0.73 and 0.70, respectively). ALK fusion-positive tumors were significantly different in tumor stage, central location, SUV(max), homogeneity on 1-, 2-, and 3-voxel distances, and sum mean on 2-voxel distance compared with ROS1/RET fusion-positive tumors.ALK/ROS1/RET fusion-positive lung adenocarcinomas possess certain clinical and imaging features that enable good discrimination of fusion-positive from fusion-negative lung adenocarcinomas.",

Cigarette smoke causes oxidative stress and an inflammatory response in lung cells, which in turn may be involved in COPD and lung cancer development. The aim of this study was to identify differential proteomic profiles related to oxidative stress response that were potentially involved in these two pathological entities. Protein content was assessed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 60 patients classified in four groups: COPD, COPD and LC, LC, and control (neither COPD nor LC). Proteins were separated into spots by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF/TOF). A total of 16 oxidative stress regulatory proteins were differentially expressed in BAL samples from LC and/or COPD patients as compared with the control group. A distinct proteomic reactive oxygen species (ROS) protein signature emerged that characterized lung cancer and COPD. In conclusion, our findings highlight the role of the oxidative stress response proteins in the pathogenic pathways of both diseases, and provide new candidate biomarkers and predictive tools for LC and COPD diagnosis.",

We aimed to evaluate whether 3-NBA is able to deregulate critical steps in cell cycle control and apoptosis in human lung epithelial A549 cells. Increased intracellular Ca(2+) and caspase activities were detected upon 3-NBA exposure. As shown by cell cycle analysis, an increased number of S-phase cells was observed after 24 h of treatment with 3-NBA. Furthermore, 3-NBA was shown to inhibit cell proliferation when added to subconfluent cell cultures. The main metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-ABA, induced statistically significant increases in tail moment as judged by alkaline comet assay. The potential of 3-NBA and 3-ABA to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was demonstrated by flow cytometry using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA). The enzyme inhibitors allopurinol, dicumarol, resveratrol and SKF525A were used to assess the impact of metabolic conversion on 3-NBA-mediated ROS production. Resveratrol decreased dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence by 50%, suggesting a role for CYP1A1 in 3-NBA-mediated ROS production. Mitochondrial ROS production was significantly attenuated (20% reduction) by addition of rotenone (complex I inhibition) and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA, complex II inhibition). Taken together, the results of the present study provide evidence for a genotoxic potential of 3-ABA in human epithelial lung cells.

Exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia enhanced sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels in lung tissues; however, the role of increased S1P in the pathobiological characteristics of bronchopulmonary dysplasia has not been investigated. We hypothesized that an altered S1P signaling axis, in part, is responsible for neonatal lung injury leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. To validate this hypothesis, newborn wild-type, sphingosine kinase1(-/-) (Sphk1(-/-)), sphingosine kinase 2(-/-) (Sphk2(-/-)), and S1P lyase(+/-) (Sgpl1(+/-)) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75%) from postnatal day 1 to 7. Sphk1(-/-), but not Sphk2(-/-) or Sgpl1(+/-), mice offered protection against hyperoxia-induced lung injury, with improved alveolarization and alveolar integrity compared with wild type. Furthermore, SphK1 deficiency attenuated hyperoxia-induced accumulation of IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2 and NOX4 protein expression in lung tissue. In vitro experiments using human lung microvascular endothelial cells showed that exogenous S1P stimulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, whereas SphK1 siRNA, or inhibitor against SphK1, attenuated hyperoxia-induced S1P generation. Knockdown of NOX2 and NOX4, using specific siRNA, reduced both basal and S1P-induced ROS formation.

EMT markers were examined by western blot analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by specific fluorescence dyes and flow cytometry. All results were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by individual comparisons with post hoc test.;The present study has revealed for the first time that the zinc could induce EMT and related metastatic behaviors in lung cancer cells. Results showed that treatment of the cells with zinc resulted in the significant increase of EMT markers N-cadherin, vimentin, snail and slug and decrease of E-cadherin proteins. Zinc-treated cells exhibited the mesenchymal-like morphology and increased cancer cell motility with significant increase of activated FAK, Rac1, and RhoA. Also, tumorigenic abilities of lung cancer cells could be enhanced by zinc. Importantly, the underlying mechanism was found to be caused by the ability of zinc to generate intracellular superoxide anion. Zinc was shown to induce cellular superoxide anion generation and the up-regulation of EMT markers and the induced cell migration and invasion in zinc-treated cells could be attenuated by the treatment of MnTBAP, a specific superoxide anion inhibitor.;Knowledge gains from this study may highlight the roles of this important element in the regulation of EMT and cancer metastasis and fulfill the understanding in the area of cancer cell biology.",

It has recently been shown to function as a negative regulator of β2-integrin-dependent neutrophil recruitment to the lung following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, we demonstrate that siglec-E promoted neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following CD11b β2-integrin ligation with fibrinogen in a sialic acid-dependent manner, but it had no effect on ROS triggered by a variety of other stimulants. Siglec-E promotion of ROS was likely mediated via Akt activation, because siglec-E-deficient neutrophils plated on fibrinogen exhibited reduced phosphorylation of Akt, and the Akt inhibitor, MK2206, blocked fibrinogen-induced ROS. In vivo imaging showed that siglec-E also promoted ROS in acutely inflamed lungs following exposure of mice to LPS. Importantly, siglec-E-promoted ROS were required for its inhibitory function, as the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, reversed the siglec-E-mediated suppression of neutrophil recruitment and blocked neutrophil ROS production in vitro. Taken together, these results demonstrate that siglec-E functions as an inhibitory receptor of neutrophils via positive regulation of NADPH oxidase activation and ROS production.

Our results showed that exposure of MPMVEC from wild-type mice to UFPs or CSE, at a non-toxic dose, induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, increased phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2, and up-regulated early growth response -1 (Egr-1) and IL-6 genes. These effects were significantly enhanced when cells were co-exposed to both UFPs and CSE. However, exposure of MPMVEC from gp91(phox) knock-out mice did not induce the above effects. Furthermore, UFPs- and/or CSE-induced Egr-1 mRNA upregulation was attenuated significantly when cells were pre-treated with p38 specific inhibitor, SB 203580, or MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, and Egr-1 siRNA treatment abolished UFPs- and/or CSE-induced overexpression of IL-6. Our results suggest that UFPs and/or CSE caused activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in ROS generation that led to activation of MAPKs through induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs and upregulation of Egr-1. Those effects may further result in endothelial dysfunction through production of cytokines such as IL-6. Our results suggest that co-exposure to UFPs and CSE causes enhanced injury to endothelial cells.",

To investigate whether exposure to a proton beam can overcome radioresistance in hypoxic tumor cells, three kinds of cancer cells, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, hepatoma HepG2 and Molt-4 leukemia cells, were treated with a proton beam (35 MeV, 1, 2, 5, 10 Gy) in the presence or absence of hypoxia. Cell death rates were determined 72 h after irradiation. Hypoxic cells exposed to the proton beam underwent a typical apoptotic program, showing condensed nuclei, fragmented DNA ladders, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed a significant increase in Annexin-V-positive cells. Cells treated with the proton beam and hypoxia displayed increased expression of p53, p21 and Bax, but decreased levels of phospho-Rb, Bcl-2 and XIAP, as well as activated caspase-9 and -3. The proton beam with hypoxia induced cell death in wild-type HCT116 cells, but not in a p53 knockout cell line, demonstrating a requirement for p53. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also significantly increased, apoptosis could also be abolished by treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated by the treatment, and their respective DN mutants restored the cell death induced by either proton therapy alone or with hypoxia. In conclusion, proton beam treatment did not differently regulate cancer cell apoptosis either in normoxic or hypoxic conditions via a p53-dependent mechanism and by the activation of p38/JNK MAPK pathways through ROS.",

In this study, the viability of human lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, was investigated after exposure to this monomer. Exposure to HEMA reduced the viability of the BEAS-2B cells as a result of increased apoptosis, interruption of the cell cycle, and decreased cell proliferation. Depletion of cellular glutathione and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were seen after exposure of BEAS-2B cells to HEMA. The glutathione synthase inhibitor, L-buthioninesulfoximine (BSO), was used to study whether the reduced viability was caused by glutathione depletion and increased levels of ROS. Similarly to incubation with HEMA, incubation with BSO resulted in glutathione depletion and increased ROS levels, without increasing cell death or inhibiting cell growth. The results indicate that HEMA-induced cell damage is not caused exclusively by these mechanisms. Mechanisms other than glutathione depletion and ROS formation seem to be of importance for the toxic effect of HEMA on lung epithelial cells. ",

This seems to reduce transport of the enzyme into mitochondria, decreasing its defense capacity against oxidative stress. The present case-control study was conducted to investigate the association of SOD2 genetic polymorphism with individual susceptibility to lung cancer. Ala16Val polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping, and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques in 100 lung cancer patients and 50 healthy control subjects.

There was a combined effect of Val/Val genotype as a genetic factor with smoking as an environment factor (OR=2.24).

To investigate ROS' dependent pathophysiological processes during silicosis we studied the kinetic clearance of instilled stable nitroxide radicals (TEMPO). Antioxidant enzymes' superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and lipid peroxidation were also studied in whole lungs of rats exposed to crystalline silica (quartz) and sham exposed controls. Low frequency L-band electron spin resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the clearance of TEMPO in whole-rat lungs directly. The clearance of TEMPO followed first order kinetics showing significant differences in the rate for clearance between the diseased and sham exposed control lungs. Comparison of TEMPO clearance rates in the sham exposed controls and silicotic rats showed an oxidative stress in the rats exposed to quartz. Studies on the antioxidant enzymes SOD and GPx in the lungs of silicotic and sham exposed animals supported the oxidative stress and accelerated clearance of TEMPO by up regulated levels of enzymes in quartz exposed animals. Increased lipid peroxidation potential in the silicotics also supported a role for enhanced generation of ROS in the pathogenesis of silica-induced lung injury. These in vivo experiments directly demonstrate, for the first time, that silicotic lungs are in a state of oxidative stress and that increased generation of ROS is associated with enhanced levels of oxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation.

Here, we demonstrate that kallistatin levels were positively correlated with the concentration of total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from patients with sepsis-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), indicating a compensatory mechanism. Lower ratio of kallistatin to total protein in BALF showed a significant trend toward elevated neutrophil counts (P = 0.002) in BALF and increased mortality (P = 0.046). In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, expression of human kallistatin in lung by gene transfer with human kallistatin-encoding plasmid ameliorated acute lung injury (ALI) and reduced cytokine/chemokine levels in BALF. These mice exhibited attenuated lung epithelial apoptosis and decreased Fas/FasL expression compared to the control mice. Mouse survival was improved by kallistatin gene transfer or recombinant human kallistatin treatment after LPS challenge. In LPS-stimulated A549 human lung epithelial cells, kallistatin attenuated apoptosis, down-regulated Fas/FasL signaling, suppressed intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited ROS-mediated NF-κB activation and inflammation. Furthermore, LPS-induced apoptosis was blocked by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or NF-κB inhibitor via down-regulating Fas expression.

About 80% of adult CF patients have chronic P. aeruginosa infection, which accounts for much of the morbidity and most of the mortality. Both bacterial genetic adaptations and defective innate immune responses contribute to the bacteria persistence. It is well accepted that CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction impairs the airways-epithelium-mediated lung defence; however, other innate immune cells also appear to be affected, such as neutrophils and macrophages, which thus contribute to this infectious pathology in the CF lung. In macrophages, the absence of CFTR has been linked to defective P. aeruginosa killing, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. To learn more about macrophage dysfunction in CF patients, we investigated the generation of the oxidative burst and its impact on bacterial killing in CF macrophages isolated from peripheral blood or lung parenchyma of CF patients, after P. aeruginosa infection. Our data demonstrate that CF macrophages show an oxidative response of similar intensity to that of non-CF macrophages. Intracellular ROS are recognized as one of the earliest microbicidal mechanisms against engulfed pathogens that are activated by macrophages. Accordingly, NADPH inhibition resulted in a significant increase in the intracellular bacteria survival in CF and non-CF macrophages, both as monocyte-derived macrophages and as lung macrophages. These data strongly suggest that the contribution of ROS to P. aeruginosa killing is not affected by CFTR mutations. ",

Moreover, MSCs have been suggested to participate in the treatment of ALI/ARDS and COPD as a major cause of high morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in the treatment of ARDS/COPD were focused on cell engraftment and paracrine action. However, ROS-mediated therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs still remain largely unknown. Here, we review the key factors associated with cell cycle and chromatin remodeling to accelerate or delay the MSC aging process. In addition, the enhanced ROS production and its associated pathophysiological pathways will be discussed along with the MSC senescence process.

In the present study, we investigated whether the PKCα/Nox-2/ATF-2/MMP-9 signaling pathway is involved in the invasive behavior of lung cancer and whether curcumin could inhibit invasion by modulating this pathway. The cytotoxic effect of curcumin was evaluated by MTT assay and the capacity of invasion was assessed by Transwell assay. siRNA and plasmid transfection techniques were used to study the function of targeted genes. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the expression levels of PKCα, Nox-2, MMP-9 and the phosphorylation of ATF-2. The results showed that curcumin inhibited the proliferation and invasion of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of MMP-9 enhanced the invasion of A549 cells. However, inhibition of MMP-9 by siRNA or curcumin suppressed cell invasion. Moreover, we also demonstrated the catalytic role of PKCα in expression of MMP-9 and cellular invasion in A549 cells, which was dependent on the expression of Nox-2 and phosphorylation of ATF-2. Finally, we also showed that curcumin dose-dependently reduced the expression of PKCα, P47phox, Nox-2 and phosphorylated ATF-2, as well as intracellular ROS generation, suggesting the inhibitory effect of curcumin on the activation of the PKCα/Nox-2/ROS/ATF-2 pathway.

Genetic manipulation of CRT expression in A549 cells through small interferring RNA inhibition or overexpression demonstrated a positive correlation between CRT expression level and cell viability in subsequent prolonged hypoxia, which indicates that CRT is a key mediator of short-term hypoxia-induced cell protection. Importantly, CRT overexpression prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during prolonged hypoxia by inducing the expression of thioredoxin (TRX), an antioxidant, in A549 cells. Furthermore, CRT promoted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, the transcription factor of TRX. Finally, overexpressing an inactive TRX mutant reversed the effects of CRT on ROS accumulation and cell protection.

The total protein level in BALF and the level of 8-isoprostane, a marker of lipid peroxidation, in lung homogenate were decreased by inhalation of NAC. Inhaled NAC induced the overexpression of Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mRNA and protein, but did not alter the expressions of other antioxidant enzymes, including CuZnSOD, extracellular SOD, and glutathione peroxydase 1.;These findings suggest that the antioxidant properties of NAC in hyperoxic lung injury involve a decrease in mitochondrial ROS in association with the induction of MnSOD, in addition to its role as a precursor of GSH.",

AMA increased a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), p27 and decreased CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, as well as cyclin D1 and cyclin E in Calu-6 cells. AMA also induced apoptosis in Calu-6 cells. The apoptotic process in AMA-treated Calu-6 cells was accompanied by the up-regulation of Bax, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), and the activation of caspase-3 and -8. All of the tested caspase inhibitors, especially pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD), markedly rescued Calu-6 cells from AMA-induced Calu-6 cell death. Inhibitors of pan-caspase and caspase-8 also prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)).

Hence, we explored the expression of Nrf2 protein in skin cancers.;The Nrf2 protein expression in 24 specimens, including 6 malignant melanomas (MM), 6 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 6 basal cell carcinomas (BCC), and 6 normal skin tissues, was evaluated by western blotting.

The western blot revealed that the Nrf2 protein was definitely expressed in normal skin tissues, but the Nrf2 expression was decreased in MM, SCC, and BCC. Immunohistochemical examination showed that expression of Nrf2 was decreased in all skin cancer tissues compared to the normal skin tissues. Keap1 was not expressed in all malignant skin tumors and normal skin tissues by western blot.;ROS was increased in various types of cancers which proteins were highly expressed or underexpressed.

However the precise mechanisms of PQ‑induced dysfunction of the mitochondria, where ROS/RNS are predominantly produced, remain to be fully elucidated. Whether globular adiponectin (gAd), a potent molecule protective to mitochondria, regulates the mitochondrial function of alveolar type II cells to reduce PQ‑induced ROS/RNS production remains to be investigated. The current study aimed to investigate the precise mechanisms of PQ poisoning in the mitochondria of alveolar type II cells, and to elucidate the role of gAd in protecting against PQ‑induced lung epithelium injury. Therefore, lung epithelial injury was induced by PQ co‑culture of alveolar type II A549 cells for 24 h. gAd was administrated to and removed from the injured cells in after 24 h. PQ was observed to reduce cell viability and increase apoptosis by ~1.5 fold in A549 cells. The oxidative/nitrative stress, resulting from ROS/RNS and disordered mitochondrial function were evidenced by increased O2‑., NO production and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), adenosine 5'‑triphosphate (ATP) content in PQ‑poisoned A549 cells. gAd treatment significantly reversed the PQ‑induced cell injury and mitochondrial dysfunction in A549 cells. The protective effects of gAd were partly abrogated by an adenosine 5'‑monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, compound C. The results suggest that reduced ΔΨ and ATP content may result in PQ‑induced mitochondrial dysfunction of the lung epithelium, which constitutes a novel mechanism for gAd exerting pulmonary protection against PQ poisoning via AMPK activation.

Exposure to the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) evoked a rapid increase in transepithelial anion secretion across monolayers of the human submucosal gland serous cell line Calu-3. This increase was almost entirely abolished by the addition of diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC), implicating the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel in the response. The response was also reduced by inhibitors of basolateral K+ channels. Studies of electrically isolated apical and basolateral membranes revealed that H2O2 stimulated both apical Cl- and basolateral K+ conductances (G(Cl) and G(K)). Apical G(Cl) was sensitive to DPC, but unaffected by 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), suggesting that CFTR is the major anion conduction pathway mediating the response to H2O2. Additionally, H2O2 had no effect on G(Cl) in the presence of the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 or following maximal stimulation of G(Cl) with forskolin, implicating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway in the apical response to H2O2. Basolateral G(K) was reduced by the K+ channel inhibitors clotrimazole and clofilium, indicating roles for KCNN4 and KCNQ1 in the H2O2-stimulated response. We propose that ROS-stimulated anion secretion from serous cells plays an important role in keeping the airways clear from damaging radicals that could potentially initiate tissue destruction. Our finding that this response is CFTR dependent suggests that an important host defence mechanism would be dysfunctional in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. Loss of this compensatory protective mechanism could expose the CF lung to ROS for extended periods, which could be important in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease.",

Adult T cell leukemia derived factor (ADF), a polypeptide made of 104 amino acids, is induced by a variety of stresses including X-ray, ultraviolet, H2O2, and mitogen. ADF has a reducing activity, which catalyzes the proton transfer between thiol-radical of cystein-containing proteins. Furthermore, ADF has a protective activity of ROS which are formed by xanthine oxidase and other alternative pathways in vitro. Using a rat in vivo model of lung ischemia, we examined the protective effect of recombinant human ADF (rhADF) against ischemia reperfusion injury of the lung. Ischemia, lasting for 75 min, was induced in the left lung of rats at 23 degrees C. The lung was then reperfused. These animals were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 6, treatment with normal saline) and group 2 (n = 6, treatment with 28 micrograms/g of rhADF). One minute after the beginning of reperfusion, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) decreased significantly in both groups (p < 0.01), without any significant intergroup difference (55.5 +/- 9.8, 49.8 +/- 8.6 mm Hg, respectively). Twenty minutes after reperfusion, PaO2 was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in group 2 (113.0 +/- 8.1 mm Hg) than in group 1 (72.3 +/- 13.6 mm Hg). The wet/dry weight ratio was significantly higher in group 1 (7.31 +/- 0.54) than in group 2 (5.82 +/- 0.36). Histologically, lung injury tended to be milder in group 2 than in group 1.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human cancers usually evolve through multistep processes. These processes are driven by the accumulation of abundant genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. However, some lung cancers depend on a single activated oncogene by somatic mutation, termed 'driver oncogenic mutations', for their proliferation and survival. EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangement are typical examples of such driver oncogenic mutations found in lung adenocarcinomas. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or ALK-TKIs significantly improved treatment outcomes compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, respectively. Therefore, treatment strategies for lung cancers have dramatically changed from a 'general and empiric' to a 'personalized and evidence-based' approach according to the driver oncogenic mutation. Several novel driver oncogenic mutations, which are candidates as novel targets, such as ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET, have been discovered. Despite these successes, several limitations have arisen. One example is that some lung cancers do not respond to treatments targeting driver oncogenic mutations, as exemplified in KRAS-mutated lung cancers. Another is resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. Such resistance includes de novo resistance and acquired resistance. A number of molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance have been reported. These mechanisms can be roughly divided into three categories: alteration of the targeted oncogenes themselves by secondary mutations or amplification, activation of an alternative oncogenic signaling track, and conversion of cellular characteristics. Overcoming resistance is a current area of urgent clinical research.",

Recent studies indicate that ROS interfere with protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and elicit a compensatory response termed the \"unfolded protein response\" (UPR). The importance of the UPR lies in its ability to alter expression of a variety of genes involved in antioxidant defense, inflammation, energy metabolism, protein synthesis, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. The present study used comparative proteomic technology to test the hypothesis that chronic cigarette smoking induces a UPR in the human lung. Studies were performed on lung tissue samples obtained from three groups of human subjects: nonsmokers, chronic cigarette smokers, and ex-smokers. Proteomes of lung samples from chronic cigarette smokers demonstrated 26 differentially expressed proteins (20 were up-regulated, 5 were down-regulated, and 1 was detected only in the smoking group) compared with nonsmokers. Several UPR proteins were up-regulated in smokers compared with nonsmokers and ex-smokers, including the chaperones, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and calreticulin; a foldase, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI); and enzymes involved in antioxidant defense. In cultured human airway epithelial cells, GRP78 and the UPR-regulated basic leucine zipper, transcription factors, ATF4 and Nrf2, which enhance expression of important anti-oxidant genes, increased rapidly (< 24 h) with cigarette smoke extract. These data indicate that cigarette smoke induces a UPR response in the human lung that is rapid in onset, concentration dependent, and at least partially reversible with smoking cessation. We speculate that activation of a UPR by cigarette smoke may protect the lung from oxidant injury and the development of COPD.",

Among phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), PI3K-γ isoform has been shown to play an important role in a number of immune/inflammatory responses.;We investigated the role of PI3K-γ and its molecular basis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI using a selective inhibitor for PI3K-γ, AS 605240, and LPS-treated C57BL/6 mice.;Treatment of mice with LPS showed an increase of lung inflammation and vascular leakage. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-4, adhesion molecule, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was also increased. Administration of AS 605240 to LPS-treated mice markedly reduced the pathophysiological features of ALI and the increased production of ROS, cytokines, adhesion molecule, and VEGF in the lung. Our results also showed that treatment of mice with LPS activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and degradation of inhibitory κBα (IκBα) through PI3K-γ. Additionally, infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) and expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were significantly increased in the lung of LPS-treated mice, and inhibition of PI3K-γ reduced the infiltration of DCs and TLR4 expression in the lung.;These results indicate that PI3K-γ is critically involved in LPS-induced ALI by regulating IκBα/NF-κB pathway and innate immune responses. Based on our data, we suggest that PI3K-γ isoform is a promising target for the treatment of ALI.",

Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) activates anti-oxidant pathways, inhibits inflammation and provides cytoprotection; hence, we hypothesized that STC1 will inhibit thrombin/PAR1 signaling and protect from bleomycin-induced pneumonitis. We determined thrombin level and activity, thrombin-induced PAR-1-mediated signaling, superoxide generation and lung pathology after intra-tracheal administration of bleomycin to WT and STC1 Tg mice. Lungs of bleomycin-treated WT mice display: severe pneumonitis; increased generation of superoxide; vascular leak; increased thrombin protein abundance and activity; activation of ERK; greater cytokine/chemokine release and infiltration with T-cells and macrophages. Lungs of STC1 Tg mice displayed none of the above changes. Mechanistic analysis in cultured pulmonary epithelial cells (A549) suggests that STC1 inhibits thrombin-induced and PAR1-mediated ERK activation through suppression of superoxide. In conclusion, STC1 blunts bleomycin-induced rise in thrombin protein and activity, diminishes thrombin-induced signaling through PAR1 to ERK, and inhibits bleomycin-induced pneumonitis. Moreover, our study identifies a new set of cytokines/chemokines, which play a role in the pathogenesis of bleomycin-induced lung injury. These findings broaden the array of potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung diseases characterized by thrombin activation, oxidant stress and inflammation. ",

The present study shows that As(3+)-transformed human lung bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells (AsT cells) exhibit the property of apoptosis resistance. The level of basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) is very low in AsT cells in correlation with elevated expressions of both antioxidant enzymes and antiapoptotic proteins. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and p62 are constitutively expressed. These two proteins up-regulate antioxidant enzymes and antiapoptotic proteins. The knockdown of Nrf2 or p62 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced both ROS levels and As(3+)-induced apoptosis in transformed cells. AsT cells have autophagy deficiency as evidenced by reduced formation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II, GFP-LC3 puncta, and autophagy flux. Results obtained using a soft agar assay and shRNA Nrf2-transfected cells show that Nrf2 plays an antioncogenic role before transformation, whereas this transcription factor plays an oncogenic role after transformation. In addition, depletion of Nrf2 by shRNA dramatically inhibited growth and proliferation of transformed cells. Furthermore, the Nrf2 protein levels and antiapoptotic and antioxidant enzyme levels are higher in lung adenocarcinoma than in normal tissues. Collectively, this study demonstrates that a constitutively high level of Nrf2 in AsT cells up-regulates the antioxidant proteins catalase and superoxide dismutase as well as the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. The final consequences are decreased ROS generation and increased apoptotic resistance, cell survival and proliferation, and tumorigenesis.",

A novel instrument, the interfacial stress rheometer (ISR), uses an oscillating magnetic needle to measure the shear viscosity and elasticity of a surfactant monolayer at the air-water interface. The ISR reveals that calf lung surfactant, Infasurf, exhibits remarkable fluidity, even when exposed to air pollution residual oil fly ash (ROFA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or conditioned media from resting A549 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). However, when Infasurf is exposed to a subphase of the soluble fraction of ROFA- or H2O2-treated AEC conditioned media, there is a prominent increase in surfactant elasticity and viscosity, representing two-dimensional gelation. Surfactant gelation is decreased when ROFA-AEC are pretreated with inhibitors of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), or with a mitochondrial anion channel inhibitor, as well as when A549-rho0 cells that lack mitochondrial DNA and functional electron transport are investigated. These results implicate both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial ROS generation in ROFA-AEC-induced surfactant gelation.

Responses to hypoxia are thought to operate via hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), but the importance of co-factors that regulate HIF signaling within tumors is not well understood. Here, we elucidate a signaling pathway that physically and functionally couples tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin to HIF1α signaling and HIF1α-mediated tumor EMT. Primary human lung adenocarcinomas accumulate pY654-β-catenin and HIF1α. All pY654-β-catenin, and only the tyrosine phosphorylated form, was found complexed with HIF1α and active Src, both within the human tumors and in lung tumor cell lines exposed to hypoxia. Phosphorylation of Y654, generated by hypoxia mediated, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent Src kinase activation, was required for β-catenin to interact with HIF1α and Src, to promote HIF1α transcriptional activity, and for hypoxia-induced EMT. Mice bearing hypoxic pancreatic islet adenomas, generated by treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, accumulate HIF1α/pY654-β-catenin complexes and develop an invasive phenotype. Concurrent administration of the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine abrogated β-catenin/HIF pathway activity and restored adenoma architecture. Collectively, the findings implicate accumulation of pY654-β-catenin specifically complexed to HIF1α and Src kinase as critically involved in HIF1α signaling and tumor invasion. The findings also suggest that targeting ROS-dependent aspects of the pY654-β-catenin/ HIF1α pathway may attenuate untoward biological effects of anti-angiogenic agents and tumor hypoxia. ",

Phx-3 suppressed the viability of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and induced cellular apoptosis 6 h after treatment. Prior to these events, intracellular pH (pHi) was rapidly decreased from pH 7.65 to 7.10 within 30 min when A549 cells were treated with 7 microM Phx-3. This intracellular acidification continued for 3 h in the cells. Augmented production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was obseved 1 h after treatment of A549 cells with 7 microM Phx-3, and cell cycle arrest at G1 was indicated 3 h after treatment. The translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytosol to the nucleus was clearly indicated 1 h after the administration of Phx-3 to A549 cells, while it was significantly suppressed when Nac, a scavenger of ROS, was added to the cells with Phx-3. The Phx-3-induced apoptosis in A549 cells was significantly suppressed when Nac was administered to the cells. These results suggest that a decrease of pHi, caused by depolarization of the mitochondria, may trigger the dysfunction of mitochondria causing ROS production; therefore, both the translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and apoptosis induction were promoted in A549 cells. Microscopic examination of the cellular localization of Phx-3 in A549 cells revealed that Phx-3 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, but not in the nucleus. The present results indicate that Phx-3 might be a strong anticancer drug against lung cancer, which is intractable to chemotherapy, by causing various early events, including the decrease of pHi and ROS production, and finally inducing cellular apoptosis.",

However, the prognostic value of DUOX1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma patients is still unclear. We investigated the prognostic value of DUOX1 expression in liver cancer patients. DUOX1 mRNA expression was determined in tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues by real‑time PCR. For evaluation of the prognostic value of DUOX1 expression, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards model (univariate analysis and multivariate analysis) were employed. A simple risk score was devised by using significant variables obtained from the Cox's regression analysis to further predict the HCC patient prognosis. We observed a reduced DUOX1 mRNA level in the cancer tissues in comparison to the non‑cancer tissues. More importantly, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high DUOX1 expression had longer disease-free survival and overall survival compared with those with low expression of DUOX1. Cox's regression analysis indicated that DUOX1 expression, age, and intrahepatic metastasis may be significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival and overall survival. Finally, we found that patients with total scores of >2 and >1 were more likely to relapse and succumb to the disease than patients whose total scores were ≤2 and ≤1. In conclusion, DUOX1 expression in liver tumors is a potential prognostic tool for patients.

AIF knockout cells failed to form tumors in athymic mice or grow in soft agar.

The effect of preconditioning on the xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XOD) system in liver grafts subjected to 8 and 16 hours of cold ischemia was also evaluated. Increased xanthine levels and marked conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) to XOD were observed after hepatic cold ischemia. Xanthine/XOD could play a role in the liver and lung damage associated with liver transplantation. This assumption is based on the observation that inhibition of XOD reduced postischemic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and hepatic injury as well as ensuing lung inflammatory damage, including neutrophil accumulation, oxidative stress, and edema formation. Ischemic preconditioning reduced xanthine accumulation and conversion of XDH to XOD in liver grafts during cold ischemia. This could diminish liver and lung damage following liver transplantation. In the liver, preconditioning prevented postischemic ROS generation and hepatic injury as well as the injurious effects in the lung following liver transplantation. Administration of xanthine and XOD to preconditioned rats led to hepatic ROS and transaminase levels similar to those found after reperfusion and abolished the protective effect of preconditioning on the lung inflammatory damage. In conclusion, ischemic preconditioning reduces both liver and lung damage following liver transplantation.

We analyzed the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and cachexia-mediated cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha) in cocultures of human colon carcinoma spheroids prepared with cells derived from tumors of different grades with human normal colon epithelial and myofibroblast cells and normal endothelial cells. We also analyzed the influence of standard chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) combined with camptothecin (CPT-11) (IFL regimen with drug concentrations adjusted to in vitro conditions) on these parameters. The results indicated that adhesion of colon carcinoma spheroids to colon epithelium and myofibroblast monolayers induced O2- anion production but decreased NO levels compared to the sum of the radicals released by monocultures of the two types of cells. Coculture of colon carcinoma spheroids with endothelium was an exception to this rule, as only HT29 cells decreased NO production. In cocultures, anticancer drugs additionally, though only slightly and insignificantly, increased the production of the radicals compared to a nontreated coculture, but in monocultures, the drugs, and especially CPT-11, were ROS inducers and simultaneously NO production inhibitors. However, the levels of released ROS and NO were dependent on the stage of colon carcinoma that the cells were derived from. LS180 cells (grade B) grown in monocultures produced the lowest ROS levels but were the best producers of NO. Adhesion of tumor spheroids to normal cells influenced the microenvironmental cytokine network compared to monocultures, decreasing IL-1beta and TNF-alpha secretion but significantly enhancing L-6 levels. The addition of the drugs had no effect on IL-1beta levels but increased TNF-alpha production and lowered the amounts of IL-6. In conclusion, cytotoxic drugs may, dependent on the stage of tumor growth or the type of chemotherapy regimen administered, significantly influence the proinflammatory cytokine network and local ROS and NO levels. Moreover, in cocultures of tumor cells with normal epithelial, myofibroblast, and endothelial cells, ROS production seems to be involved in local cell injury, which was detected by confocal microscopy. On the other hand, high level of NO seems to facilitate tumor cell interactions with the endothelium and metastasis as NO production was the highest in a monoculture of HUVEC and remained at high levels in cocultures of colon cancer cells with HUVEC. Among the proinflammatory cytokines, only IL-6 seems to significantly influence colon carcinoma development and metastasis. Attenuation of IL-6 production after chemotherapy can be a useful prognostic factor of its effectiveness.",

Histological diagnosis disclosed precancerous lesions of the larynx in 34 cases and in 7 cases, squamous cell carcinoma Immunohistochemical study was performed using antibodies against the cell surface markers S-100, HLA-DR, CD20, CD45 RO, CD45 RA, and Lag. Typical dendritic cell distributions of the immunostained specimens were photographed and measured on a quantitative basis. The medical histories of the patients were then analyzed retrospectively.;HLA-DR+ cells could be detected in 14 of 16 cases in mild dysplastic lesions. The infiltration of the dysplastic lesions was sparse compared to cases with higher-graded dysplastic lesions. The distribution patterns of the dendritic cells in specimens with severe dysplastic lesions, but squamous cell carcinoma were extremely similar and markedly different from those in grades I and II specimens. Memory T lymphocytes (CD45 RO+) were detected more often in the group with severe dysplastic lesions (8 of 9 cases) than in the group with squamous cell carcinoma (3 of 8 cases). The inverse became evident for CD20 and CD45 RA immunolabeling.;Few dendritic cells were found in the precancerous lesions. This may suggest that these early lesions (grades I and H) are not efficiently monitored by the immune system. Therefore they may develop into carcinomas unimpaired by cytotoxic T cells.

Compound 25 (SAN7401), the hydroquinone form of 22, induced a significant release of intracellular ROS and apoptosis (EC50 = 1.3-2.6 μM) in cancer cell lines, including A549 and HCT-116.

Another hydroquinone tethering 12-carbon chain, 26 (SAN4601), generated reduced levels of ROS but showed more potent cytotoxicity (EC50 = 0.8-1.6 μM) in cancer cells, although it lacked selectivity over noncancerous cells, implying that the naturally occurring 17-carbon chain is also crucial for ROS production and a selective anticancer effect.

In cancer therapy, YPFS is being combined with chemotherapy drugs to achieve improved efficacy; however, scientific evidence to illustrate this combination effect is lacking. The present study aims to demonstrate the anti-drug resistance of YPFS in cisplatin (DDP)-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549/DDP). The application of YPFS exhibited a synergistic enhancement of DDP-induced cytotoxicity as well as of the apoptotic signalling molecules. DDP-induced expression of the multi-drug-resistance efflux transporters was markedly reduced in the presence of YPFS, resulting in a higher intracellular concentration of DDP. In addition, the application of YPFS increased DDP-induced ROS accumulation and MMP depletion, decreased p62/TRAF6 signalling in DDP-treated A549/DDP cells. The co-treatment of DDP and YPFS in tumour-bearing mice reduced the tumour size robustly (by more than 80%), which was much better than the effect of DDP alone. These results indicate that YPFS can notably improve the DDP-suppressed cancer effect, which may be a consequence of the elevation of intracellular DDP via the drug transporters as well as the down regulation of p62/TRAF6 signalling.

Treatment of rats with tempol (10, 30, or 100 mg/kg 15 min prior to carrageenan) attenuated the pleural exudation and the migration of polymorphonuclear cells caused by carrageenan dose dependently. Tempol also attenuated the lung injury (histology) as well as the increase in the tissue levels of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde caused by carrageenan in the lung. However, tempol did not inhibit the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the lungs. Immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine revealed positive staining in lungs from carrageenan-treated rats. Lung tissue sections from carrageenan-treated rats also showed positive staining for poly-(ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS). The degree of staining for nitrotyrosine and PARS was markedly reduced in tissue sections obtained from carrageenan-treated rats, which had received tempol (100 mg/kg). Furthermore, treatment of rats with tempol significantly reduced (i) the formation of peroxynitrite, (ii) the DNA damage, (iii) the impairment in mitochondrial respiration, and (iv) the fall in the cellular level of NAD(+) observed in macrophages harvested from the pleural cavity of rats treated with carrageenan. Tempol also attenuated the cell injury caused by hydrogen peroxide (1 mM) in cultured human endothelial cells.

AdipoR1/2 involved in adiponectin-activated NADPH oxidase and mitochondria, which further promoted intracellular ROS accumulation. Protein kinase C (PKC) may involve an adiponectin-activated NADPH oxidase. Similarly, p300 phosphorylation and histone H4 acetylation occurred in adiponectin-challenged A549 cells. Moreover, adiponectin-upregulated cPLA2 and COX-2 expression was significantly abrogated by ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine) or the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (apocynin), mitochondrial complex I (rotenone), PKC (Ro31-8220, Gö-6976, and rottlerin), and p300 (garcinol). Briefly, we reported that adiponectin stimulated cPLA2 and COX-2 expression via AdipoR1/2-dependent activation of PKC/NADPH oxidase/mitochondria resulting in ROS accumulation, p300 phosphorylation, and histone H4 acetylation. These results suggested that adiponectin promoted lung inflammation, resulting in exacerbation of pulmonary diseases via upregulating cPLA2 and COX-2 expression together with intracellular ROS production.

Altered mechanical stress is detected by a cell-associated complex involving caveolae and other membrane proteins that results in endothelial cell membrane depolarization and then the activation of specific kinases that lead to the assembly of NOX2 components. ROS generated by this enzyme amplify the mechanosignal within the endothelial cell to regulate activation and/or synthesis of proteins that participate in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and vascular remodeling.

Our results showed that thuja successfully induced apoptosis in functional p53-expressing mammary epithelial carcinoma cells. Abrogation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), prevention of p53-activation, knockdown of p53 or inhibition of its functional activity significantly abridged ROS generation. Notably, under these conditions, thuja-induced breast cancer cell apoptosis was reduced, thereby validating the existence of an ROS-p53 feedback loop. Elucidating this feedback loop revealed bi-phasic ROS generation as a key mediator of thuja-induced apoptosis. the first phase of ROS was instrumental in ensuring activation of p53 via p38MAPK and its nuclear translocation for transactivation of Bax, which induced a second phase of mitochondrial ROS to construct the ROS-p53 feedback loop. Such molecular crosstalk induced mitochondrial changes i) to maintain and amplify the thuja signal in a positive self-regulatory feedback manner; and ii) to promote the mitochondrial death cascade through cytochrome c release and caspase-driven apoptosis.

It also induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and p53 and increased expression of p21. When we pre-treated cells with ERK, JNK, p38, p53 inhibitor or NAC followed by WA treatment, only ERK and p53 inhibitors blocked WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. We further observed Ras (HRas, KRas and NRas) and Raf activation, and found that WA treatment increased HRas-Raf activation. Knockdown of HRas by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. HRas siRNA also halted Raf, ERK, p53 activation and p21 accumulation. Molecular docking analysis suggested that WA could bind to HRas-GTP, causing accumulation of Ras-GTP and excessive activation of Raf/ERK/p53-p21. The direct binding affinity was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In vivo, WA suppressed tumor growth without adverse toxicity and presented the same mechanism as that in vitro.

We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase derived from bone marrow (BM) cells contributes importantly to lung IR injury. An in vivo mouse model of lung IR injury was employed. Wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) mice, p47(phox) knockout (p47(phox)-/-) mice, or chimeras created by BM transplantation between WT and p47(phox)-/- mice were assigned to either Sham (left thoracotomy) or six study groups that underwent IR (1 h left hilar occlusion and 2 h reperfusion). After reperfusion, pulmonary function was assessed using an isolated, buffer-perfused lung system. Lung injury was assessed by measuring vascular permeability (via Evans blue dye), edema, neutrophil infiltration (via myeloperoxidase [MPO]), lipid peroxidation (via malondialdyhyde [MDA]), and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Lung IR resulted in significantly increased MDA in WT mice, indicative of oxidative stress. WT mice treated with apocynin (an NADPH oxidase inhibitor) and p47(phox)-/- mice displayed significantly reduced pulmonary dysfunction and injury (vascular permeability, edema, MPO, and MDA). In BM chimeras, significantly reduced pulmonary dysfunction and injury occurred after IR in p47(phox)-/--->WT chimeras (donor-->recipient) but not WT-->p47(phox)-/- chimeras. Induction of TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6, RANTES (CCL5), KC (CXCL1), MIP-2 (CXCL2), and MCP-1 (CCL2) was significantly reduced after IR in NADPH oxidase-deficient mice and p47(phox)-/--->WT chimeras but not WT-->p47(phox)-/- chimeras. These results indicate that NADPH oxidase-generated ROS specifically from BM-derived cells contributes importantly to lung IR injury. NADPH oxidase may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IR injury after lung transplantation.",

LDH release was measured using a detection kit. Cell cycle was analyzed using a flow cytometer. Intracellular ROS level was measured with the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein probe. Phosphorylation of p38 was determined using Western blot.;Compounds 5b, 5d, and 5e (40 and 80 μmol/L) caused significant decrease of A549 cell viability, while other 4 compounds had no effect on the cells.

The major vascular segment contributing to HPV, the intra-acinar artery, is mostly located in that part of the lung that cannot be selectively reached by the presently available techniques, e.g. hemodynamic studies of isolated perfused lungs, recordings from dissected proximal arterial segments or analysis of subpleural vessels. The aim of the present study was to establish a model which allows the investigation of HPV and its underlying mechanisms in small intra-acinar arteries.;Intra-acinar arteries of the mouse lung were studied in 200 mum thick precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). The organisation of the muscle coat of these vessels was characterized by alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry. Basic features of intra-acinar HPV were characterized, and then the impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, inhibitors of the respiratory chain and Krebs cycle metabolites was analysed.;Intra-acinar arteries are equipped with a discontinuous spiral of alpha-smooth muscle actin-immunoreactive cells. They exhibit a monophasic HPV (medium gassed with 1% O2) that started to fade after 40 min and was lost after 80 min. This HPV, but not vasoconstriction induced by the thromboxane analogue U46619, was effectively blocked by nitro blue tetrazolium and diphenyleniodonium, indicating the involvement of ROS and flavoproteins. Inhibition of mitochondrial complexes II (3-nitropropionic acid, thenoyltrifluoroacetone) and III (antimycin A) specifically interfered with HPV, whereas blockade of complex IV (sodium azide) unspecifically inhibited both HPV and U46619-induced constriction. Succinate blocked HPV whereas fumarate had minor effects on vasoconstriction.;This study establishes the first model for investigation of basic characteristics of HPV directly in intra-acinar murine pulmonary vessels. The data are consistent with a critical involvement of ROS, flavoproteins, and of mitochondrial complexes II and III in intra-acinar HPV. In view of the lack of specificity of any of the classical inhibitors used in such types of experiments, validation awaits the use of appropriate knockout strains and siRNA interference, for which the present model represents a well-suited approach.",

Hematologic study showed polyclonal hyper-gamma-globulinemia, positive anti-nuclear antibodies, and positive antibodies to Ro (SS-A) antigens. Ophthalmologic study demonstrated keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Parotid sialography showed an apple tree sign. Histopathologic features of labial salivary gland biopsy revealed agglomeration of at least 50 mononuclear cells. Chest CT showed non-segmental dense opacity in outer zones of middle and lower lung fields. Lung function test revealed a restrictive pattern with low diffusion capacity. Blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia (PaO2: 74 Torr, PaCO2: 32 Torr). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid disclosed increased lymphocytes, and histologic features of a transbronchial lung biopsy included thickening of alveolar walls, infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitium, and foamy cells in alveolar spaces. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with primary Sjögren syndrome with interstitial lung disease. Bakumondo-to (Mai men dong tang) was started for the troublesome dry cough. The cough was subjectively relieved, cough scores were decreased, QOL scores improved, and sensitivity of the cough reflex measured by inhalation of capsaicin improved, but the chest roentgenogram was unchanged. Steroid hormone therapy was added, and radiographic abnormalities improved subsequently. Bakumondo-to, a traditional Chinese blended medicine, has notable antitussive activity in bronchitic guinea-pigs and in patients with postinfectious cough.

Et Wils (Sargentodoxaceae), in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced acute lung inflammatory response and injury (ALI). The inflammatory mediator levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pathologic changes in lung tissues were evaluated via pathological section with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. To investigate the mechanism whereby liriodendrin regulates lung inflammation, the phosphorylation of the NF-kB (p65) and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by western blot assay. We show that liriodendrin treatment significantly improved the survival rate of mice with CLP-induced sepsis. Pulmonary histopathologic changes, alveolar hemorrhage, and neutrophil infiltration were markedly decreased by liriodendrin. In addition, liriodendrin decreased the production of the proinflammatory mediators including (TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, and IL-6) in lung tissues. Vascular permeability and lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) accumulation in the liriodendrin-treated mice were substantially reduced. Moreover, liriodendrin treatment significantly suppressed the expression of VEGF and activation of NF-kB in the lung. We further show that liriodendrin significantly reduced the production of proinflammatory mediators and downregulated NF-kB signaling in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Moreover, liriodendrin prevented the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by upregulating the expression of SIRT1 in RAW 264.7 cells.

Increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by TGFβ1 is a common pathological feature of fibrosis. In the present study, probucol and lovastatin, which are therapeutics used for hyperlipidemia and proposed to act as anti-oxidants, were examined in terms of their effect on TGFβ1-induced formation of ROS and expression of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), a myofibroblast marker, in human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL1 cells). The effects of anti-oxidative enzymes and reagents including N-acetyl-L-cysteine, α-tocopherol, and lecithinized-superoxide dismutase (SOD) on TGFβ1-induced expression of αSMA were also examined. Treatment with probucol (30 µM) and lovastatin (1 µM and 3 µM), in addition to lecithinized-SOD, significantly inhibited the TGFβ1-induced formation of ROS and αSMA. Other anti-oxidants including N-acetyl-L-cysteine had marginal effects on αSMA expression under the conditions.

Proteasome inhibitors are promising anticancer agents. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib effectively suppresses certain types of cancer, including multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. However, bortezomib poorly inhibits solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma. The activation of Akt represents an adaptive response that prevents bortezomib-induced cell apoptosis. In the present study, bortezomib induced phosphorylation of EGFR, Src and Akt in hepatoma cells and inhibition of Src reduced bortezomib-induced EGFR and Akt phosphorylation. Treatment of hepatoma cells with bortezomib led to an increase in the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibits bortezomib-induced ROS production and abrogates the phosphorylation of Src, epidermal growth factor receptor and Akt. The combination of bortezomib and saracatinib, a Src inhibitor, synergistically induced hepatoma cell apoptosis. The present study concluded that ROS mediated the activation of the Src-EGFR-Akt cascade by bortezomib.

Cabozantinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targets MET, VEGFR, RET, ROS1, and AXL, which are implicated in lung cancer tumorigenesis. We compared the efficacy of cabozantinib alone or in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC.;This three group, randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial was done in 37 academic and community oncology practices in the USA. Patients were eligible if they had received one or two previous treatments for advanced non-squamous, EGFR wild-type, NSCLC. Patients were stratified by performance status and line of therapy, and randomly assigned using permuted blocks within strata to receive open-label oral daily dosing of erlotinib (150 mg), cabozantinib (60 mg), or erlotinib (150 mg) and cabozantinib (40 mg). Imaging was done every 8 weeks. At the time of radiographic progression, there was optional crossover for patients in either single-drug group to receive combination treatment. The primary endpoint was to compare progression-free survival in patients given erlotinib alone versus cabozantinib alone, and in patients given erlotinib alone versus the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib. We assessed the primary endpoint in the per-protocol population, which was defined as all patients who were eligible, randomly assigned, and received at least one dose of treatment. The safety analysis population included all patients who received study treatment irrespective of eligibility. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01708954.;Between Feb 7, 2013, and July 1, 2014, we enrolled and randomly assigned 42 patients to erlotinib treatment, 40 patients to cabozantinib treatment, and 43 patients to erlotinib plus cabozantinib treatment, of whom 111 (89%) in total were included in the primary analysis (erlotinib [n=38], cabozantinib [n=38], erlotinib plus cabozantinib [n=35]). Compared with erlotinib alone (median 1·8 months [95% CI 1·7-2·2]), progression-free survival was significantly improved in the cabozantinib group (4·3 months [3·6-7·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·39, 80% CI 0·27-0·55; one-sided p=0·0003) and in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group (4·7 months [2·4-7·4]; HR 0·37, 0·25-0·53; one-sided p=0·0003). Among participants included in the safety analysis of the erlotinib (n=40), cabozantinib (n=40), and erlotinib plus cabozantinib (n=39) groups, the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhoea (three [8%] cases in the erlotinib group vs three [8%] in the cabozantinib group vs 11 [28%] in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group), hypertension (none vs ten [25%] vs one [3%]), fatigue (five [13%] vs six [15%] vs six [15%]), oral mucositis (none vs four [10%] vs one [3%]), and thromboembolic event (none vs three [8%] vs two [5%]). One death due to respiratory failure occurred in the cabozantinib group, deemed possibly related to either drug, and one death due to pneumonitis occurred in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group, deemed related to either drug or the combination.;Despite its small sample size, this trial showed that, in patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC, cabozantinib alone or combined with erlotinib has clinically meaningful, superior efficacy to that of erlotinib alone, with additional toxicity that was generally manageable.

        "Doc_abstract":"The mechanism underlying the inflammatory role of TRPA1 in lung epithelial cells (LECs) remains unclear. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) sequentially induced several events in LECs. The Ca(2+) influx was prevented by decreasing extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine, removing extracellular Ca(2+) with the chelator EGTA, or treating with the TRPA1 antagonist HC030031. NADPH oxidase activation was abolished by its inhibitor apocynin, EGTA, or HC030031. The increased intracellular ROS was halted by apocynin, N-acetyl-cysteine, or HC030031. The activation of the MAPKs/NF-κB signaling was suppressed by EGTA, N-acetyl-cysteine, or HC030031. IL-8 induction was inhibited by HC030031 or TRPA1 siRNA. Additionally, chronic cigarette smoke (CS) exposure in wild-type mice induced TRPA1 expression in LECs and lung tissues. In CS-exposure trpa1 (-/-) mice, the increased BALF level of ROS was similar to that of CS-exposure wild-type mice; yet lung inflammation was lessened. Thus, in LECs, CSE may initially increase extracellular ROS, which activate TRPA1 leading to an increase in Ca(2+) influx. The increased intracellular Ca(2+) contributes to activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in increased intracellular ROS, which activate the MAPKs/NF-κB signaling leading to IL-8 induction. This mechanism may possibly be at work in mice chronically exposed to CS. ",

Our objective was to examine whether exogenous administration of nebulized HA might interfere with lung inflammation in CF.;F508del homozygous mice (Cftr(F508del) ) and transgenic mice overexpressing the ENaC channel β-subunit (Scnn1b-Tg) were treated with nebulized HA (0.5 mg/mouse/day for 7 days). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, and macrophage infiltration were assessed on lung tissues.

Bound in an un-reactive state to various metalloproteins, e.g. ferritin, most lysosomal iron is kept separated from reactive oxygen species (ROS) by intracellular anti-oxidative enzyme systems. Some ROS may, however, escape this protective shield of antioxidants, react with small amounts of free redox-active iron within lysosomes, thereby causing peroxidative damage on lysosomes and possibly also ensuing cell death. Since macrophages, containing large amounts of lysosomal iron, are very resistant to TNF-alpha, we hypothesized that this cell type has developed specific defense mechanisms against TNF-alpha-induced ROS generation. Murine macrophages were exposed (or not) to non-toxic concentrations of TNF-alpha and/or iron and were then challenged with H(2)O(2). Iron-exposed oxidatively stressed cells exhibited extensive lysosomal disruption resulting in pronounced cell death. In contrast, TNF-alpha stabilized lysosomes and protected cells, particularly those iron-exposed, by reducing cellular iron and increasing H-ferritin. Intracellular generation of H(2)O(2) under oxidative stress was kept unchanged by TNF-alpha and/or iron. However, TNF-alpha increased basal levels of glutathione by up-regulating the synthesis of gamma-glutamylcystein synthetase, thereby strengthening the anti-oxidative capacity. TNF-alpha inhibitors would block this novel anti-oxidative defense system, possibly explaining their adverse effects on the lung.",

As2O3 induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and caused a massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was able to prevent As2O3-induced cell death, implying an involvement of ROS in the induction of As2O3-triggered apoptosis. Furthermore, As2O3 initiated apoptosis by triggering of the mitochondria apoptotic pathway as indicated by inhibited Bcl-2 expression, a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c and activation of the caspase cascade. However, these As2O3-induced events can be prevented by NAC.

Moreover, we had examined ETME's role in inducing intracellular ROS with the regulation of antioxidants and MAPK pathway.;Anticancer activity of ETME was thoroughly studied using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and western blotting; along with various biochemical assays for analysing ROS-induced regulation of antioxidant enzymes. Inhibition of invasion and migration of malignant cells by ETME were investigated by wound healing and zymographic studies. DNA-Protein interaction with ETME was also studied.;ETME inhibited the growth of both A549 (IC50 92.14 µg/ml) and MCF-7 cells (IC50 50.27 µg/ml) by inducing apoptosis, while remained non-toxic against nomral WI-38 cells (IC50 911.43 µg/ml). ETME treatment resulted in increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, BID truncation and activation of caspase cascade. This ultimately leads to PARP degradation and apoptosis through the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway in both A549 and MCF-7 cells. Wound healing and gelatin zymography studies revealed that ETME significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of both A549 and MCF-7 cells dose-dependently through the downregulation of MMP-9. Further investigations showed that ETME selectively induces intracellular ROS, regulated the levels of intracellular antioxidants and suppresses the activation of ERK1/2, JNK, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in both type of malignant cells. Further DNA and protein binding studies revealed that ETME strongly interact with DNA as well as protein attributing the possibilities of presence of components which are targeting the macromolecules in cancer cells. Moreover, when the identified compounds from ETME were examined for their cytotoxicities individually, it was found that they lost their specificities towards cancer cells and also attacked normal cells.;Our study suggests that ETME retards the growth of both lung and breast cancer cells, in vitro, through multivariate mechanisms, proving its candidature for the development of better and safer drugs against these cancers.",

ROS may contribute to pulmonary oxygen toxicity by overwhelming redox homeostasis, altering signaling cascades that affect cell fate, ultimately leading to hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI). HALI is characterized by pronounced inflammatory responses with leukocyte infiltration, injury, and death of pulmonary cells, including epithelia, endothelia, and macrophages.

In doing so, ROS impact numerous fundamental cellular processes, and have thus been implicated as critical mediators of both homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Vascular reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) is a major contributor of ROS within the lung. The generation of ROS in the pulmonary vasculature has a pivotal role in endothelial cell (EC) activation and function. Alterations in EC phenotype contribute to vascular tone, permeability, and inflammatory responses and, thus, have been implicated in numerous diseases of the lung, including pulmonary hypertension, ischemic-reperfusion injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

However, little is known about relationship between proteasome inhibition and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in normal lung cells. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of MAPK inhibitors on MG132-treated human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells in relation to cell growth inhibition, cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH). Treatment with 15 μM MG132 increased ROS levels including mitochondrial O(2•)(-) and GSH depleted cell numbers in HPF cells at 24 hours. MAP kinase or ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor did not significantly affect cell growth inhibition, cell death, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; ΔΨ(m)), ROS level and GSH depletion in MG132-treated HPF cells. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor attenuated the growth inhibition and death by MG132. This inhibitor also significantly decreased O(2•)(-) level in MG132-treated HPF cells. Although p38 inhibitor slightly enhanced HPF cell growth inhibition by MG132, this inhibitor and siRNA prevented HPF cell death induced by MG132. p38 inhibitor also attenuated d O(2•)(-) level and GSH depletion. Moreover, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), JNK or p38 siRNA did not strongly affect ROS levels in MG132-treated HPF cells. ERK and JNK siRNAs decreased anonymous ubiquitinated protein levels in MG132-treated HPF cells. In conclusion, MAPK inhibitors differently affected the growth inhibition and death of MG132-treated HPF cells. Especially, p38 inhibitor attenuated HPF cell death by MG132, which was in part related to changes in ROS and GSH levels.",

Furthermore, adhesion molecule expression is attenuated on mouse mastocytoma and human leukemia cells that survive short-term culture in the presence of paclitaxel. In the present study we show that MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells that survived culture for 72 h in the presence of submaximal cytotoxic concentrations of paclitaxel (0.02 and 0.01 microg/ml) showed decreased expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. Paclitaxel treatment of MDA-MB-435 cells was associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and the activation of caspase-3. The antioxidant glutathione protected MDA-MB-435 cells from paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity and reduced ICAM-1 expression. In addition, a selective inhibitor of caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK), as well as a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), partially prevented the decrease in ICAM-1 expression observed following paclitaxel treatment, but did not protect against paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity. We conclude that the paclitaxel-induced reduction in ICAM-1 expression by MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells is both ROS- and caspase-dependent, whereas paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity is ROS-dependent and does not involve caspases. Decreased ICAM-1 expression by breast carcinoma cells that survive paclitaxel treatment may negatively impact on cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated destruction of paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cells in the context of chemo-immunotherapy or chemo-adoptive immunotherapy.",

Treatment of the Riluzole leads to a suppression of cell proliferation in liver primary cancer cells and cancer cell lines. In addition, Riluzole induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in SNU449 and Huh7 cell lines. In a line with the known function of glutamate release inhibitor, we found Riluzole-treated cells have increased the level of inner cellular glutamate that in turn decrease the glutathione (GSH) level and finally augment the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We confirm this finding in vivo by showing the Riluzole-induced GSH and ROS changes in a Huh7 xenograft cancer model. Altogether, these data suggest the anti-cancer effect of Riluzole on hepatocellular carcinoma and the suppression of glutamate signaling might be a new target pathway for HCC therapy.",

It serves as an important scaffolding protein at focal adhesions by recruiting and binding to structural and signaling molecules. Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation at Y31 and Y118 is important for paxillin redistribution to focal adhesions and angiogenesis. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are potent stimulators of lamellipodia formation, a prerequisite for endothelial cell migration. The role played by paxillin and its tyrosine phosphorylated forms in HGF- or S1P-induced lamellipodia formation and barrier function is unclear. HGF or S1P stimulated lamellipodia formation, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at Y31 and Y118, and c-Abl in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). Knockdown of paxillin with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or transfection with paxillin mutants (Y31F or Y118F) mitigated HGF- or S1P-induced lamellipodia formation, translocation of p47 (phox) to lamellipodia, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HLMVECs. Furthermore, exposure of HLMVECs to HGF or S1P stimulated c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at Y31 and Y118 in a time-dependent fashion, and down-regulation of c-Abl with siRNA attenuated HGF- or S1P-mediated lamellipodia formation, translocation of p47 (phox) to lamellipodia, and endothelial barrier enhancement. In vivo, knockdown of paxillin with siRNA in mouse lungs attenuated ventilator-induced lung injury. Together, these results suggest that c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at Y31 and Y118 regulates HGF- or S1P-mediated lamellipodia formation, ROS generation in lamellipodia, and endothelial permeability.

In this study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on drug-induced cellular apoptosis against the cultured human lung adenocarcinoma cells and explored the role of histone deacetylase (HDAC) signaling in this process. The results showed that melatonin treatment led to a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the viability of human A549 and PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Additionally, melatonin exhibited potent anticancer activity in vitro, as evidenced by reductions of the cell adhesion, migration, and the intracellular glutathione (GSH) level and increases in the apoptotic index, caspase 3 activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A549 and PC9 cells. Melatonin treatment also influenced the expression of HDAC-related molecules (HDAC1 and Ac-histone H3), upregulated the apoptosis-related molecules (PUMA and Bax), and downregulated the proliferation-related molecule (PCNA) and the anti-apoptosis-related molecule (Bcl2). Furthermore, the inhibition of HDAC signaling using HDAC1 siRNA or SAHA (a potent pan-inhibitor of HDACs) sensitized A549 and PC9 cells to the melatonin treatment. In summary, these data indicate that in vitro-administered melatonin is a potential suppressor of lung adenocarcinoma cells by the targeting of HDAC signaling and suggest that melatonin in combination with HDAC inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic intervention for human lung adenocarcinoma.

Generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), secretion of cytokines, chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors are believed to play a role. Interleukin IL-1beta, encoded by the IL1B gene, is a key cytokine produced and secreted by many cell types after activation by biological or chemical agents. Several polymorphisms in the IL1B gene have been identified, and some are associated with increased risk for lung cancer. Especially, the IL1B -31T/C polymorphism has received attention. We have investigated the effect of the lung carcinogens cigarette-smoke condensate (CSC) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) on the promoters of the IL1B gene varying only at the site of the -31T/C polymorphism. The promoter fragments containing either C or T were cloned in luciferase reporter vectors and transfected into human lung epithelial NCI-H2009 cells. The results show that treatment of the transfected cells with CSC or B[a]P induced the promoter significantly above the control level.

Recent reports, however, revealed that p66Shc protein level is significantly elevated in several human cancer tissues and growth-stimulated carcinoma cells, suggesting a mitogenic and carcinogenic role for p66Shc. In this communication, we demonstrate for the first time that p66Shc mediates androgenic growth signals in androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cells through mitochondrial ROS production. Growth stimulation of prostate cancer cells with 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is accompanied by increased p66Shc level and ROS production, which is abolished by antioxidant treatments. However, antioxidant treatments do not affect the transcriptional activity of androgen receptor (AR) as observed by its inability to block DHT-induced prostate-specific antigen expression, an AR-dependent correlate of prostate cancer progression. Elevated expression of p66Shc by cDNA transfection increases the basal cell proliferation and, thus, reduces additional DHT-induced cell proliferation. Furthermore, DHT increases the translocation of p66Shc into mitochondria and its interaction with cytochrome c. Conversely, both redox-negative p66Shc mutant (W134F), which is deficient in cytochrome c interaction, and p66Shc small interfering RNA decrease DHT-induced cell proliferation. These results collectively reveal a novel role for p66Shc-ROS pathway in androgen-induced prostate cancer cell proliferation and, thus, may play a role in early prostate carcinogenesis.",

However, the causal role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from environmental exposures and inflammatory/interstitial cells in mediating fibrosis as well as how best to target an imbalance in ROS production in patients with fibrosis is not firmly established. We focus on the role of ROS in pulmonary fibrosis and, where possible, highlight overlapping molecular pathways in other organs. The key origins of oxidative stress in pulmonary fibrosis (e.g. environmental toxins, mitochondria/NADPH oxidase of inflammatory and lung target cells, and depletion of antioxidant defenses) are reviewed. The role of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis by mitochondria- and p53-regulated death pathways is examined. We emphasize an emerging role for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in pulmonary fibrosis. After briefly summarizing how ROS trigger a DNA damage response, we concentrate on recent studies implicating a role for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and repair mechanisms focusing on 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg1) as well as crosstalk between ROS production, mtDNA damage, p53, Ogg1, and mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2). Finally, the association between ROS and TGF-β1-induced fibrosis is discussed. Novel insights into the molecular basis of ROS-induced pulmonary diseases and, in particular, lung epithelial cell death may promote the development of unique therapeutic targets for managing pulmonary fibrosis as well as fibrosis in other organs and tumors, and in aging; diseases for which effective management is lacking.

In this study, we investigated the effect of curcumin on cell anoikis as a possible mechanism of anti-tumorigenic action of curcumin, and evaluated the potential role of Bcl-2 and Cav-1 in this process. Our results showed that ectopic expression of either Bcl-2 or Cav-1 induced anoikis resistance of lung carcinoma H460 cells. Curcumin downregulated Bcl-2 protein during anoikis and sensitized the cells to detachment-induced apoptosis, whereas it had no significant effect on Cav-1 protein expression. Bcl-2 down-regulation as well as anoikis enhancement by curcumin were inhibited by superoxide anion scavenger, Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride, but were unaffected by other ROS scavengers including catalase and deferoxamine, suggesting that superoxide anion is a key player in the downregulation of Bcl-2 by curcumin. Furthermore, we provided evidence that curcumin decreased Bcl-2 level through ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation which sensitized cells to detachment-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate a novel pathway for curcumin regulation of Bcl-2 and provide a key mechanism of anoikis regulation that may be exploited for metastatic cancer treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Both occupational and environmental exposure to particles is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Particles are thought to impact on genotoxicity as well as on cell proliferation via their ability to generate oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). For mechanistic purposes, one should discriminate between a) the oxidant-generating properties of particles themselves (i.e., acellular), which are mostly determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the particle surface, and b) the ability of particles to stimulate cellular oxidant generation. Cellular ROS/RNS can be generated by various mechanisms, including particle-related mitochondrial activation or NAD(P)H-oxidase enzymes. In addition, since particles can induce an inflammatory response, a further subdivision needs to be made between primary (i.e., particle-driven) and secondary (i.e., inflammation-driven) formation of oxidants. Particles may also affect genotoxicity by their ability to carry surface-adsorbed carcinogenic components into the lung. Each of these pathways can impact on genotoxicity and proliferation, as well as on feedback mechanisms involving DNA repair or apoptosis. Although abundant evidence suggests that ROS/RNS mediate particle-induced genotoxicity and mutagenesis, little information is available towards the subsequent steps leading to neoplastic changes. Additionally, since most of the proposed molecular mechanisms underlying particle-related carcinogenesis have been derived from in vitro studies, there is a need for future studies that evaluate the implication of these mechanisms for in vivo lung cancer development. In this respect, transgenic and gene knockout animal models may provide a useful tool. Such studies should also include further assessment of the relative contributions of primary (inflammation-independent) and secondary (inflammation-driven) pathways.",

Furthermore, following injury or infection, lung tissue faces the additional challenge of inflammation-induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Little is known about the identity or distribution of lung antioxidant enzymes under normal conditions or during infection-induced inflammation. Using a mouse model of influenza (H1N1 influenza virus A/PR/8/34 [PR8]) in combination with bioinformatics, we identified seven lung-abundant antioxidant enzymes: Glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3), Superoxide dismutase 3 (Sod3), Transferrin (Tf), peroxyredoxin6 (Prdx6), glutathione S-transferase kappa 1 (Gstk1), Catalase (Cat), and Glutathione peroxidase 8 (Gpx8). Interestingly, despite the demand for antioxidants during inflammation, influenza caused depletion in two key antioxidants: Cat and Prdx6. As Cat is highly expressed in Clara cells, virus-induced Clara cell loss contributes to the depletion in Cat. Prdx6 is also reduced due to Clara cell loss, however there is a coincident increase in Prdx6 levels in the alveoli, resulting in only a subtle reduction of Prdx6 overall. Analogously, Gpx3 shifts from the basement membranes underlying the bronchioles and blood vessels to the alveoli, thus maintaining balanced expression. Taken together, these studies identify key lung antioxidants and reveal their distribution among specific cell types. Furthermore, results show that influenza depletes key antioxidants, and that in some cases there is coincident increased expression, consistent with compensatory expression. Given that oxidative stress is known to be a key risk factor during influenza infection, knowledge about the antioxidant repertoire of lungs, and the spatio-temporal distribution of antioxidants, contributes to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of influenza-induced morbidity and mortality.",

The sequence of events leading to apoptosis following proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is unclear. Bortezomib effects on components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were examined: generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alteration in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. With human H460 lung cancer cells, bortezomib exposure at 0.1 microM showed induction of apoptotic cell death starting at 24 h, with increasing effects after 48-72 h of treatment. After 3-6 h, an elevation in ROS generation, an increase in Delta psi m, and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, were observed in a time-dependent manner. Co-incubation with rotenone and antimycin A, inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III, or with cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, resulted in inhibition of bortezomib-induced ROS generation, increase in Delta psi m, and cytochrome c release. Tiron, an antioxidant agent, blocked the bortezomib-induced ROS production, Delta psi m increase, and cytochrome c release. Tiron treatment also protected against the bortezomib-induced PARP protein cleavage and cell death. Benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of pan-caspase, did not alter the bortezomib-induced ROS generation and increase in Delta psi m, although it prevented bortezomib-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and apoptotic death. In PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells (with overexpression of Bcl-2), a reduction of bortezomib-induced ROS generation, Delta psi m increase was correlated with cellular resistance to bortezomib and the attenuation of drug-induced apoptosis. The transient transfection of wild type p53 in p53 null H358 cells caused stimulation of the bortezomib-induced apoptosis but failed to enhance ROS generation and Delta psi m increase. Thus ROS generation plays a critical role in the initiation of the bortezomib-induced apoptotic cascade by mediation of the disruption of Delta psi m and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.",

Our results reveal the genetic basis of 200 lung adenocarcinomas in Koreans including deep characterization of 87 surgical specimens by transcriptome sequencing. We identified driver somatic mutations in cancer genes including EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, MET, and CTNNB1.

We found 45 fusion genes, eight of which were chimeric tyrosine kinases involving ALK, RET, ROS1, FGFR2, AXL, and PDGFRA. Among 17 recurrent alternative splicing events, we identified exon 14 skipping in the proto-oncogene MET as highly likely to be a cancer driver. The number of somatic mutations and expression outliers varied markedly between individual cancers and was strongly correlated with smoking history of patients. We identified genomic blocks within which gene expression levels were consistently increased or decreased that could be explained by copy number alterations in samples.

The increased oxidant burden results from the fact that cigarette smoke contains over 4700 different chemical compounds and more than 10(15) oxidants/free radicals per puff. Other factors, such as air pollutants, infections, and occupational dusts that may exacerbate COPD, also have the potential to produce oxidative stress. These oxidants give rise to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) that are generated enzymatically by inflammatory and epithelial cells within the lung as part of an inflammatory immune response towards a pathogen or irritant. Thus, while ROS are necessary for host defence against invading pathogens, increased levels of ROS have been implicated in initiating inflammatory responses in the lungs through the activation of transcriptional factors, signal transduction pathways, chromatin remodelling and gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. However, the normal lung has developed defences to ROS-mediated damage, which include antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase.

In the present study, intratracheal instillation of this PKCδ inhibitor resulted in peptide distribution throughout the lung parenchyma and pulmonary endothelium and decreased neutrophil influx, with concomitant attenuation of sepsis-induced endothelial ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in this model. To further delineate the role of PKCδ in regulating neutrophil migration, we used an in vitro transmigration model with human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). Consistent with in vivo findings, inhibition of PMVEC PKCδ decreased IL-1β-mediated neutrophil transmigration. PKCδ regulation was stimulus-dependent; PKCδ was required for transmigration mediated by IL-1β and fMLP (integrin-dependent), but not IL-8 (integrin-independent). PKCδ was essential for IL-1β-mediated neutrophil adherence and NF-κB-dependent expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. In PMVECs, IL-1β-mediated production of ROS and activation of redox-sensitive NF-κB were PKCδ dependent, suggesting an upstream signaling role.

Here, we report that HO-1 and SOCS-3 were induced in A549 cells and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs) treated with (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). EGCG protected against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-mediated lung inflammation by down-regulation of oxidative stress and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression in A549 cells or HPAEpiCs and the lungs of mice. EGCG inhibited TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression, THP-1 cells adherence, pulmonary hematoma and leukocyte (eosinophils and neutrophils) count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in mice. In addition, EGCG also attenuated TNF-α-induced oxidative stress, p47(phox) translocation, MAPKs activation, and STAT-3 and activating transcription factor (ATF)2 phosphorylation. EGCG also reduced the formation of a TNFR1/TRAF2/Rac1/p47(phox) complex. Moreover, in this study, the observed suppression of TNF-α-stimulated ICAM-1 expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by EGCG was abrogated by transfection with siRNA of SOCS-3 or HO-1. These results suggested that HO-1 or SOCS-3 functions as a suppressor of TNF-α signaling, not only by inhibiting adhesion molecules expression but also by diminishing intracellular ROS production and STAT-3 and ATF2 activation in A549 cells or HPAEpiCs and the lungs of mice.",

Here, we explore whether APE1 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect ERK signaling and cell cycle progression following Pb exposure. We found that Pb induced APE1 expression and ROS generation in CL3 human lung cancer cells. The Pb-elicited ROS levels and cytotoxicity were further enhanced by introducing small interfering RNA specific for APE1 (siAPE1). E3330, an inhibitor of APE1 redox activity, also augmented the ROS levels and cytotoxicity in Pb-treated cells. Intriguingly, the capability of Pb to activate ERK was abolished under siAPE1 or E3330 co-treatments; conversely, forced expression of APE1 up-regulated the ERK activation by Pb or serum in both Cys65-redox activity dependent and independent manners. Moreover, APE1 formed complex with ERK2, and its redox activity could rescue ERK oxidative inactivation. APE1 redox activity also facilitated the Cyclin D1 expression and G1-to-S progression following Pb exposure. In summary, the results indicate that APE1 is a direct redox regulator of ERK for maintaining the kinase activity to promote cell proliferation.",

We therefore assessed hypoxia-induced changes in cytosolic ROS in PASMCs of precision-cut mouse lung slices expressing the redox-sensitive protein, RoGFP. Superfusion of lung slices with hypoxic media (1.5% O(2)) resulted in a significant oxidation of RoGFP from normoxic baseline that was attenuated by overexpression of cytosolic catalase. Hypoxic superfusion also increased [Ca(2+)](i) above normoxic baseline; this response was significantly attenuated by cytosolic catalase overexpression or by the administration of EUK134, a synthetic SOD-catalase mimetic. The hypoxia-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), indicating that ROS signals trigger entry of extracellular calcium.

However, apoptotic cells markedly increased in H460 and A549 cells. In WI38 and H1299 cells, DHC-induced catalase was correlated with a decrease of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an increase in the level of LC3II, an autophagy marker, and LC3 conversion was attenuated by the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) or by knockdown of the catalase gene. In A549 cells, DHC downregulated catalase, led to ROS accumulation, and blocked LC3 conversion. In H460 cells expressing limited amount of catalase, DHC caused ROS accumulation and blocked LC3 conversion. However, H460 cells overexpressing catalase were able to induce autophagy. In contrast to Earle's balanced salt solution and rotenone, H(2)O(2) treatment caused ROS accumulation and did not promote upregulation of catalase and LC3II in lung cell lines. Cytoplasmic vacuolization in WI38 and H1299 cells was blocked by treatment of 3AT and which enhanced caspase-3 activity and LDH release. Suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine also enhanced DHC-induced cell death through apoptotic and necrotic cell death. In A549 and H460 cells, treatment of rapamycin attenuated DHC-induced cell death.

Antioxidant enzymes, such as extracellular superoxide dismutase (ECSOD), may modulate the injury and repair components of the fibrogenic response. Here we determined whether ECSOD could attenuate experimental TGF-β1-induced persistent lung fibrosis. In this study, primary human lung fibroblasts, MRC-5 fibroblasts and A549 epithelial cells were exposed to recombinant active TGF-β1. An adenovirus vector that expresses human ECSOD (AdECSOD) was constructed and rats were endotracheally intubated with an adenoviral vector encoding active TGF-β1 (AdTGF-β1), AdECSOD or a control vector (AdDL70) alone or in combinations AdTGF-β1/AdDL70 or AdTGF-β1/AdECSOD. TGF-β1 alone induced fibrotic responses and significantly down-regulated endogenous ECSOD gene expression both in vitro and in vivo and caused oxidative stress in rat lung, associated with increased levels of activated TGF-β1 in lung fluid and tissue. ECSOD protein was markedly reduced in the interstitium and fibrotic foci in TGF-β1 induced experimental lung fibrosis. The fibrotic response caused by AdTGF-β1 was markedly attenuated by concomitant gene transfer using AdECSOD, detected by lung function measurements, histologic and morphometric analysis, hydroxyproline content and fibrosis-related gene expression. In addition, the oxidative stress and increased presence of activated TGF-β1 in rat lung induced by AdTGF-β1 was significantly reduced by ECSOD gene transfer. These findings suggest a substantial role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1 driven persistent pulmonary fibrosis and enhanced presence of ECSOD can inhibit latent TGF-β1 activation by ROS and diminish subsequent fibrotic responses.",

The present study investigates the role of P2X7 receptor in a murine model of silicosis. To that end wild-type (C57BL/6) and P2X7 receptor knockout mice received intratracheal injection of saline or silica particles. After 14 days, changes in lung mechanics were determined by the end-inflation occlusion method. Bronchoalveolar lavage and flow cytometry analyzes were performed. Lungs were harvested for histological and immunochemistry analysis of fibers content, inflammatory infiltration, apoptosis, as well as cytokine and oxidative stress expression. Silica particle effects on lung alveolar macrophages and fibroblasts were also evaluated in cell line cultures. Phagocytosis assay was performed in peritoneal macrophages. Silica exposure increased lung mechanical parameters in wild-type but not in P2X7 knockout mice. Inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition in lung parenchyma, apoptosis, TGF-β and NF-κB activation, as well as nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-1β secretion were higher in wild-type than knockout silica-exposed mice. In vitro studies suggested that P2X7 receptor participates in silica particle phagocytosis, IL-1β secretion, as well as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production.

Various groups of active compounds found in cigarette smoke such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), and reactive oxygen specicies (ROS) can induce EMT through different signaling pathways. The links between EMT and biological responses to cigarette smoke, such as hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative damages, are also discussed. The effect of cigarette smoke on EMT is not only limited to cancer types directly related to smoking, such as lung cancer, but has also been found in other types of cancer. Altogether, this review emphasizes the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms of the induction of EMT by cigarette smoking and will help in identifying novel small molecules for targeting EMT induced by smoking.

Treatment of mESCs with 20 ng/mL AA for 6 days under hypoxia further increased the expression of DE marker genes Sox17, Foxa2, and Cxcr4 by 501-, 1,483-, and 126-fold above maintenance cultures, respectively. Transient exposure to hypoxia, as short as 24 h, was sufficient to enhance AA-induced endoderm formation. The involvement of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the AA-induced endoderm enrichment was assessed using HIF-1α(-/-) mESCs and the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Under SP conditions, HIF-1α(-/-) mESCs failed to increase the expression of endodermal marker genes but rather shifted toward ectoderm. Hypoxia induced only a marginal potentiation of AA-induced endoderm differentiation in HIF-1α(-/-) mESCs. Treatment of mESCs with AA and NAC led to a dose-dependent decrease in Sox17 and Foxa2 expression. In addition, the duration of exposure to hypoxia in the course of a recently reported lung differentiation protocol resulted in differentially enhanced expression of distal lung epithelial cell marker genes aquaporin 5 (Aqp5), surfactant protein C (Sftpc), and secretoglobin 1a1 (Scgb1a1) for alveolar epithelium type I, type II, and club cells, respectively.

Cancer cells were exposed to carefully controlled hypoxic conditions and investigated for EMT changes and signal transduction by using morphological, cell and molecular biology techniques.

Experimental manipulation, including silencing of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and the specific inhibition of mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), revealed that early EMT-related events induced by hypoxia (GSK-3beta inhibition and SNAIL translocation) were dependent on transient intracellular increased generation of ROS whereas late migration and invasiveness were sustained by HIF-1alpha- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent mechanisms.

Despite intensive research, the underlying mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed as key mediators of HPV. However, there is ongoing discussion as to whether ROS really contribute to HPV regulation and if so, whether an increase or a decrease in ROS occurs during alveolar hypoxia. In this overview, we summarize our data that have led us to conclude that alveolar hypoxia induces an increase in superoxide and subsequently H2O2, and thus elicits HPV. This conclusion is drawn from investigations employing various inhibitors that interfere with ROS in isolated buffer-perfused rabbit lungs challenged with 10-minute periods of alveolar hypoxia. Targeting possible sources of a hypoxia-induced increase in ROS, our data are only partially in accordance with the hypothesis that mitochondria are the hypoxia-dependent ROS generators, and suggest NADPH oxidases as an alternative source. From measurements of intracellular and exhaled H2O2, we hypothesize that total lung ROS release is reduced in alveolar hypoxia, but that in specialized cells or sub-cellular structures an increased ROS release may occur, triggering HPV.",

Metabolic activation is a key prerequisite for PAHs to cause their deleterious effects. Using human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells, we provide evidence for the metabolic activation of (+/-)-trans-7,8dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol) by aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) to yield benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione (B[a]P-7,8-dione), a redox-active o-quinone. We show that B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol (AKR substrate) and B[a]P-7,8-dione (AKR product) lead to the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (measured as an increase in dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluores-cence) and that similar changes were not observed with the regioisomer (+/-)-trans-4,5-dihydroxy-4,5-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene or the diol-epoxide, (+/-)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9alpha,10beta-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-B[a]P. B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol and B[a]P-7,8-dione also caused a decrease in glutathione levels and an increase in NADP(+)/NADPH ratios, with a concomitant increase in single-strand breaks (as measured by the comet assay) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo). The specificity of the comet assay was validated by coupling it to human 8-oxo-guanine glycosylase (hOGG1), which excises 8-oxo-Gua to yield single-strand breaks. The levels of 8-oxo-dGuo observed were confirmed by an immunoaffinity purification stable isotope dilution ([(15)N(5)]-8-oxo-dGuo) liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MRM/MS) assay. B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol produced DNA strand breaks in the hOGG1-coupled comet assay as well as 8-oxo-dGuo (as measured by LC-ESI/MRM/MS) and was enhanced by a catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, suggesting that COMT protects against o-quinone-mediated redox cycling.

Exposure of the cells to both paraquat and hydrogen peroxide resulted in significantly higher mutation frequencies compared with untreated control cells. Mutation frequencies up to 27-fold higher than the spontaneous mutation frequencies were obtained. The majority of the reversion mutants contained frameshift mutations within the target sequence.

In this study, we studied the signaling processes associated between tobacco exposure and lung cancer. First, we detected and validated pathway-specific gene expression at bronchial epithelium. These proteins reflected the activation of signaling pathways relevant to tobacco exposure, including ATM, BCL2, GPX1, K-Ras, IKBKB, and SIRT1. Tobacco smoking was simulated via reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway. ROS not only arrested cell cycle at G1/S stage but also increased expressions of Sirt1 and p27. Further studies showed that the expression of p27 was dependent on ERK1/2 activation, and p27 itself could halt cell cycle by inhibiting the activation of CDKs. Moreover, activation of K-Ras, the key regulator of Ras/ERK pathway, was tightly regulated by enzyme activity of Sirt1. Deacetylation of K-Ras by Sirt1 increased the transformation of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, promoting the activation of downstream of ERK1/2. In reverse, Ras/ERK pathway could also regulate Sirt1 transcription. In conclusion, inhibition of Sirt1 may be an effective strategy for the prevention of tumor progression in high-risk patients or as a therapeutic strategy in established tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pulmonary oxidant stress plays an important pathogenetic role in disease conditions including acute lung injury/adult respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), hyperoxia, ischemia-reperfusion, sepsis, radiation injury, lung transplantation, COPD, and inflammation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), released from activated macrophages and leukocytes or formed in the pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells, damage the lungs and initiate cascades of pro-inflammatory reactions propagating pulmonary and systemic stress. Diverse molecules including small organic compounds (e.g. gluthatione, tocopherol (vitamin E), flavonoids) serve as natural antioxidants that reduce oxidized cellular components, decompose ROS and detoxify toxic oxidation products. Antioxidant enzymes can either facilitate these antioxidant reactions (e.g. peroxidases using glutathione as a reducing agent) or directly decompose ROS (e.g. superoxide dismutases [SOD] and catalase). Many antioxidant agents are being tested for treatment of pulmonary oxidant stress. The administration of small antioxidants via the oral, intratracheal and vascular routes for the treatment of short- and long-term oxidant stress showed rather modest protective effects in animal and human studies. Intratracheal and intravascular administration of antioxidant enzymes are being currently tested for the treatment of acute oxidant stress. For example, intratracheal administration of recombinant human SOD is protective in premature infants exposed to hyperoxia. However, animal and human studies show that more effective delivery of drugs to cells experiencing oxidant stress is needed to improve protection. Diverse delivery systems for antioxidants including liposomes, chemical modifications (e.g. attachment of masking pegylated [PEG]-groups) and coupling to affinity carriers (e.g. antibodies against cellular adhesion molecules) are being employed and currently tested, mostly in animal and, to a limited extent, in humans, for the treatment of oxidant stress. Further studies are needed, however, in order to develop and establish effective applications of pulmonary antioxidant interventions useful in clinical practice. Although beyond the scope of this review, antioxidant gene therapies may eventually provide a strategy for the management of subacute and chronic pulmonary oxidant stress.",

Lung fibroblasts are key participants in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix within the lung parenchyma. However, it still remains unknown how pulmonary fibroblasts are affected by cigarette smoking. Therefore, in this study, we isolated lung fibroblasts from mice and determined the apoptotic mechanism in response to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). When the lung fibroblasts were exposed to CSE, the generation of ROS was increased as shown by H2-DCFDA staining and Flow Cytometry. By immunocytochemistry, Ki67 expressing cells gradually decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The nitrite concentration in the supernatants increased, while the SOD activity and GSH recycling decreased in response to CSE. CSE increased the mRNA levels of TNF-α and COX-2, and the secretory proteins TNF-α and IL-6 increased as measured by ELISA. We next determined whether this inflammatory process is associated with the Bax/Bcl-2 apoptosis pathway. The Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio increased, and cleaved caspase-3 protein was activated in the lung fibroblasts treated with CSE. Moreover, CSE induced the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr701/Ser727 and increased the activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in the MAPK pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that CSE-mediated inflammation alters the redox regulation via the MAPK-STAT1 pathway, leading to intrinsic apoptosis of lung fibroblasts. ",

We therefore examined whether inhaled NAC inhibits lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin (BLM). Male ICR mice were given a single intravenous injection of BLM (150 mg/ kg). Thirty milliliters of NAC (70 mg/ml) or saline were inhaled twice a day for 28 d using an ultrasonic nebulizer. In the inflammatory phase (Day 7), NAC administration attenuated the cellular infiltration in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and alveolar tissues. At Day 28, the fibrotic changes estimated by Aschroft's criteria and hydroxyproline content in the NAC inhalation group were significantly decreased compared with the BLM-only group (p < 0.05). CXC chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (KC), and CC chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), in BALF were mostly elevated on Day 7 in the BLM-only group; however, these elevations were significantly repressed by NAC inhalation (p < 0.05). Lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) was also quantified in BALF. LPO was markedly increased on Day 3 in the BLM-only group, and this increase was significantly decreased by NAC inhalation (p < 0.05). These results revealed that aerosolized NAC ameliorated acute pulmonary inflammation induced by BLM injection via the repression of chemokines and LPO production, resulting in the attenuation of subsequent lung fibrosis. These findings are limited to the BLM-induced lung fibrosis animal model. However, NAC inhalation will be expected to be a potential therapy for patients with other interstitial pneumonias because ROS are involved in the pathogenesis of lung injury in most interstitial pneumonia.",

Previously, we reported the ability of a small molecule compound, C1, to induce ROS dependent autophagy associated apoptosis in human cancer cell lines and primary tumor cells (Wong C. et al. 2010). Our ongoing investigations have unraveled a hitherto undefined novel signaling network involving hyper-phosphorylation of Akt and Akt-mediated ROS production in cancer cell lines. Interestingly, drug-induced Akt activation is selectively seen in cell lines that carry mutant KRAS; HCT116 cells that carry the V13D KRAS mutation respond favorably to C1 while HT29 cells expressing wild type KRAS are relatively resistant. Of note, not only does the compound target mutant KRAS expressing cells but also induces RAS activation as evidenced by the PAK pull down assay. Corroborating this, pharmacological inhibition as well as siRNA mediated silencing of KRAS or Akt, blocked C1-induced ROS production and rescued tumor colony forming ability in HCT116 cells. To further confirm the involvement of KRAS, we made use of mutant KRAS transformed RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells. Notably, drug-induced ROS generation and death sensitivity was significantly higher in RWPE-1-KRAS cells than the RWPE-1-vector cells, thus confirming the results obtained with mutant KRAS colorectal carcinoma cell line. Lastly, we made use of HCT116 mutant KRAS knockout cells (KO) where the mutant KRAS allele had been deleted, thus expressing a single wild-type KRAS allele. Exposure of the KO cells to C1 failed to induce Akt activation and mitochondrial ROS production. Taken together, results show the involvement of activated Akt in ROS-mediated selective targeting of mutant KRAS expressing tumors, which could have therapeutic implications given the paucity of chemotherapeutic strategies specifically targeting KRAS mutant cancers.

The silicotic pathology owes its severity to the structural and chemo-physical properties of the particles such as shape, size and abundance of surface radicals. In earlier studies, we reported that significant amounts of surface radicals can be generated on crystalline silica by chemical aggression with ascorbic acid (AA), a vitamin naturally abundant in the lung surfactant, and this reaction led to enhanced cytotoxicity and production of inflammatory mediators in a macrophage cell line. However in the lung, other cells acting in the development of silicosis, like fibroblasts and endothelial cells, can come to direct contact with inhaled quartz. We investigated the cytotoxic/pro-inflammatory effects of AA-treated quartz microcrystals (QA) in human primary fibroblasts and endothelial cells as compared to unmodified microcrystals (Q). Our results show that, in fibroblasts, the abundance of surface radicals on quartz microcrystals (Q vs QA) significantly enhanced cell proliferation (with or without co-culture with macrophages), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, NF-κB nuclear translocation, smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, Bcl-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression and collagen production. Contrariwise, endothelial cells reacted to the presence of quartz microcrystals independently from the abundance of surface radicals showing similar levels of cytotoxicity, ROS production, cell migration, MCP-1, ICAM-I and fibronectin gene expression when challenged with Q or QA. In conclusion, our in vitro experimental model demonstrates an important and quite unexplored direct contribute of silica surface radicals to fibroblast proliferation and fibrogenic responses. ",

However, the role of non-canonical TGFβ-TAK1 signaling in EMT remains unclear. Herein, we show that TAK1 deficiency drives metastatic skin squamous cell carcinoma earlier into EMT that is conditional on the elevated cellular ROS level. The expression of TAK1 is consistently reduced in invasive squamous cell carcinoma biopsies. Tumors derived from TAK1-deficient cells also exhibited pronounced invasive morphology. TAK1-deficient cancer cells adopt a more mesenchymal morphology characterized by higher number of focal adhesions, increase surface expression of integrin α5β1 and active Rac1. Notably, these mutant cells exert an increased cell traction force, an early cellular response during TGFβ1-induced EMT. The mRNA level of ZEB1 and SNAIL, transcription factors associated with mesenchymal phenotype is also upregulated in TAK1-deficient cancer cells compared with control cancer cells. We further show that TAK1 modulates Rac1 and RhoA GTPases activities via a redox-dependent downregulation of RhoA by Rac1, which involves the oxidative modification of low-molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase. Importantly, the treatment of TAK1-deficient cancer cells with Y27632, a selective inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase and antioxidant N-acetylcysteine augment and hinders EMT, respectively. Our findings suggest that a dysregulated balance in the activation of TGFβ-TAK1 and TGFβ-SMAD pathways is pivotal for TGFβ1-induced EMT. Thus, TAK1 deficiency in metastatic cancer cells increases integrin:Rac-induced ROS, which negatively regulated Rho by LMW-PTP to accelerate EMT. ",

O2 toxicity is mediated through reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are constantly generated as byproducts of normal cellular metabolism, but their production is increased in various pathological states, and also upon exposure to exogenous oxidants, such as hyperoxia. Antioxidants, either enzymatic or nonenzymatic, protect the lung against the deleterious effects of ROS. Expression of various pulmonary antioxidants is developmentally regulated in many species so that the expression is increased toward term gestation, as if in anticipation of birth into an O2-rich extrauterine environment. Therefore, the lungs of prematurely born infants may be ill-adapted for protection against ROS. While premature birth interrupts normal lung development, the clinical condition necessitating the administration of high inhaled O2 concentrations may lead to permanent impairment of alveolar development.

We then employed this technique to characterize hypoxia-dependent ROS release, with specific attention paid to NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide formation as a possible vasoconstrictor pathway.;While perfusing lungs with CPH over a range of inspired oxygen concentrations (1-21 %), the rate of CP* formation exhibited an oxygen-dependence, with a minimum at 2.5 % O2. Addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to the buffer fluid illustrated that a minor proportion of this intravascular ROS leak was attributable to superoxide. Stimulation of the lungs by injection of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) into the pulmonary artery caused a rapid increase in CP* formation, concomitant with pulmonary vasoconstriction. Both the PMA-induced CPH oxidation and the vasoconstrictor response were largely suppressed by SOD. When the PMA challenge was performed at different oxygen concentrations, maximum superoxide liberation and pulmonary vasoconstriction occurred at 5% O2. Using a NADPH oxidase inhibitor and NADPH-oxidase deficient mice, we illustrated that the PMA-induced superoxide release was attributable to the stimulation of NADPH oxidases.;The perfusion of isolated lungs with CPH is suitable for detection of intravascular ROS release by ESR spectroscopy. We employed this technique to demonstrate that 1) PMA-induced vasoconstriction is caused \"directly\" by superoxide generated from NADPH oxidases and 2) this pathway is pronounced in hypoxia.

It is now becoming clear that these ROS generated secondarily after Ir have a variety of biological roles. Although mitochondria are assumed to be responsible for this Ir-induced ROS production, it remains to be elucidated how Ir triggers it. Therefore, we conducted this study to decipher the mechanism of Ir-induced mitochondrial ROS production. In human lung carcinoma A549 cells, Ir (10 Gy of X-rays) induced a time-dependent increase in the mitochondrial ROS level. Ir also increased mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration, and mitochondrial ATP production, suggesting upregulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function after Ir. Although we found that Ir slightly enhanced mitochondrial ETC complex II activity, the complex II inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid failed to reduce Ir-induced mitochondrial ROS production. Meanwhile, we observed that the mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial DNA level were upregulated after Ir, indicating that Ir increased the mitochondrial content of the cell. Because irradiated cells are known to undergo cell cycle arrest under control of the checkpoint mechanisms, we examined the relationships between cell cycle and mitochondrial content and cellular oxidative stress level. We found that the cells in the G2/M phase had a higher mitochondrial content and cellular oxidative stress level than cells in the G1 or S phase, regardless of whether the cells were irradiated. We also found that Ir-induced accumulation of the cells in the G2/M phase led to an increase in cells with a high mitochondrial content and cellular oxidative stress level. This suggested that Ir upregulated mitochondrial ETC function and mitochondrial content, resulting in mitochondrial ROS production, and that Ir-induced G2/M arrest contributed to the increase in the mitochondrial ROS level by accumulating cells in the G2/M phase.",

Here, we show a robust increase in MT-I/MT-II mRNA level and MT proteins in the livers and lungs of C57BL/6 mice exposed to the influenza A/PR8 virus that infects the upper respiratory tract and lungs. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) had a pronounced effect on the induction of these genes in the liver but not the lung. Treatment of the animals with RU-486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, inhibited induction of MT-I/MT-II in both liver and lung, revealing a direct role of glucocorticoid that is increased upon infection in this induction process. In vivo genomic footprinting (IVGF) analysis demonstrated involvement of almost all metal response elements, major late transcription factor/antioxidant response element (MLTF/ARE), the STAT3 binding site on the MT-I upstream promoter, and the glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE1), located upstream of the MT-II gene, in the induction process in the liver and lung. In the lung, inducible footprinting was also identified at a unique gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) response element (gamma-IRE) and at Sp1 sites. The mobility shift analysis showed activation of STAT3 and the glucocorticoid receptor in the liver and lung nuclear extracts, which was consistent with the IVGF data. Analysis of the newly synthesized mRNA for cytokines in the infected lung by real-time PCR showed a robust increase in the levels of IL-10 and IFN-gamma mRNA that can activate STAT3 and STAT1, respectively. A STAT1-containing complex that binds to the gamma-IRE in vitro was activated in the infected lung. No major change in MLTF/ARE DNA binding activity in the liver and lung occurred after infection. These results have demonstrated that MT-I and MT-II can be induced robustly in the liver and lung following experimental influenza virus infection by overlapping but distinct molecular mechanisms.",

Hyperoxia-induced lung injury was evaluated by using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis and pathology. Statistically significant interstrain variation was found for BALF inflammatory cells and protein (heritability estimates range: 33.6-55.7%). Genome-wide association mapping using injury phenotypes identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Comparative mapping of the chromosome 6 QTLs identified Chrm2 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 2, cardiac) as a candidate susceptibility gene, and mouse strains with a nonsynonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Chrm2 that causes an amino acid substitution (P265L) had significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced inflammation compared to strains without the SNP. Further, hyperoxia-induced lung injury was significantly reduced in neonatal mice with targeted deletion of Chrm2, relative to wild-type controls.

Particulate APN, APB, and APA activities were decreased in both ChRCC and RO (tumor vs. nontumor tissues). Interestingly, activities were downregulated in a tumor-type specific way and the intensities of the decreases were stronger in the benign tumor than in the malignant type. Moreover, when two key histopathological parameters for tumor prognosis (high vs. low stage and grade) were analyzed, increases of activity were also observed in several of these cell surface peptidases (APN, APB). Some soluble activities (APB, Asp-AP) were also downregulated in the RCCs. With respect to genetic expression, PSA and APN were in a positive correlation related to their activities in both ChRCC and RO; but not APB, Asp-AP, APA, and PGI.

Therefore, to search for indole compounds with more efficacy and less side effect for cancer therapy, we developed a novel indole compound SK228 and examined its effects and mechanisms on antitumor growth and invasion inhibition in cell and tumor xenografts in nude mice models. SK228 significantly inhibited growth of different lung and esophageal cancer cell lines at sub-micromolar range, but not normal lung cells. SK228 induced DNA damages mainly by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in apoptosis. SK228 treatment increased the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol along with the increased activity of caspase-3 and -9 without affecting caspase-8, whereas these effects were attenuated by ROS inhibitor. The expression levels of BCL-2 family regulators were also affected. Moreover, low-dose SK228 significantly reduced the invasion of cancer cells. The active phosphorylated form of FAK/Paxillin signaling pathway proteins and active form of RhoA were decreased. Moreover, the F-actin cytoskeleton was disrupted after low-dose SK228 treatment. Growth of an A549 tumor cell xenograft was markedly inhibited without significant side effects. SK228-induced apoptosis was confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and immunohistochemistry of cleaved caspase-3 in tumors from treated mice. Our study provides the first evidence that SK228 exhibits cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity by inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In addition, SK228 inhibits cancer cell invasion via FAK/Paxillin disruption at noncytotoxic doses. SK228 can be further tested as a pharmaceutical compound for cancer treatment.",

Recent studies demonstrate that SP cells isolated from various cancer cell lines and primary tumors possess stem-cell-like properties. Thus, targeting tumor SP cells may provide new strategies for treatment in clinic. We previously showed that 1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone (emodin), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator, enhanced sensitivity of gallbladder cancer SGC-996 cells to cisplatin (CDDP) via generation of ROS and downregulation of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). To determine whether emodin also acts effectively on cancer stem cells of gallbladder carcinoma, we use SP cells as a model of cancer stem-cell-like cells. Here, we found that emodin, via ROS-related mechanism and suppressing the function of ATP-binding cassette super-family G member (ABCG2), which is known to be associated with Hoechst dye efflux activity of SP cells, not only reduced the ratio, inhibited clone formation, and eliminated sphere formation of SP cells effectively, but also promoted obviously the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin, the main substrate of the efflux pump ABCG2. In addition, emodin could sensitize CDDP, via inhibition of expression of ABCG2, to overcome chemoresistance of SP cells. Importantly, similar to the experiment in vitro, emodin/CDDP co-treatment in vivo suppressed the tumor growth derived from SP cells through downregulating ABCG2 expression. Our results suggest that emodin is an effective agent targeting cancer stem-like SP cells of gallbladder carcinoma, either alone or acts as a chemotherapy enhancer.",

In the present study, we determined whether tissue hypoxia/hypoperfusion decreased MnSOD protein concentration or mRNA expression in the lung as well, changes that would suggest pretranslational regulation of enzyme activity. Expression of MnSOD may be critical in determining the degree of tissue injury during re-oxygenation because the mitochondrial electron transport system produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) both during hypoxia and re-oxygenation. We purified MnSOD protein from rabbit livers to a specific activity of approximately 3,500 U/mg protein and found the amino terminal sequence nearly identical to those of the rat and human MnSOD proteins. Lung MnSOD protein content was quantitated by immunoassay, and MnSOD mRNA content was determined by slot blotting. Results from five control and six experimental rabbits, the right lungs of which had been hypoxic/hypoperfused because of collapse for 7 days, demonstrated a 32% decrease (P < 0.03) in MnSOD protein content (42 +/- 8 micrograms/mg DNA in hypoxic lungs compared with 61 +/- 3 micrograms/mg DNA in contralateral lungs) that was not due to decreased numbers of mitochondria.

Previously we demonstrated that in cultured mouse lung epithelial cells exposed to bolus administration of H(2)O(2), TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity was inhibited, whereas c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was enhanced via a mechanism involving TNF receptor-1 (TNF-RI). In this study we used the nonphagocytic NADPH oxidase (Nox1) to study the effects of endogenously produced ROS on a line of mouse alveolar type II epithelial cells. Nox1 expression and activation inhibited TNF-alpha-induced inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK), and NF-kappaB while promoting JNK activation and cell death. Nox1-induced JNK activation and cell death were attenuated through expression of a dominant-negative TNF-RI construct, implicating a role for TNF-RI in Nox1 signaling. Furthermore, Nox1 used the TNF-RI adaptor protein TNF-receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), and the redox-regulated JNK MAP3K, apoptosis signal kinase-1 (ASK1), to activate JNK. In addition, ASK1 siRNA attenuated both Nox1-induced JNK activity and cell death.

However, its role in the transdifferentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) to type I cells (AECIs) is unclear and requires further investigation. In this study, newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 90% oxygen for up to 14 days to mimic BPD in human infants, with neonatal pups exposed to room air (21% oxygen) as controls. Primary rat AECIIs were cultured under hyperoxic conditions for up to 24 hours to further investigate the underlying mechanisms. This study found that hyperoxia promoted a significant and time-dependent increase of AECII marker surfactant protein (SP)-C in the lung. The increase of AECI marker T1α was repressed by hyperoxia during lung development. These results indicated an impaired AECII transdifferentiation. Pulmonary ROS concentration and expression of autophagic protein LC-3B were increased gradually in response to hyperoxia exposure. Furthermore, AECIIs produced more ROS when cultured under hyperoxic conditions in vitro. Both the LC3B expression and the conversion from LC3BI to LC3BII were enhanced in hyperoxic AECs. Interestingly, inhibition of LC3B either by ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) or adenovirus-mediated LC3B shRNA could partly restore AECII transdifferentiation under hyperoxia condition. In summary, the current study reveals a novel role of activated LC3B induced by hyperoxia in AECII transdifferentiation. ",

As demonstrated by the WST-8 assay, exposure to CSE (2.5%, 5%, and 10%) reduced the cell viability of A549 cells (84%, 64% and 53%) in a dose-dependent manner and treatment with ICT 10 μM dramatically attenuated CSE induced cytotoxicity (73% and 64%).

However, ICT-mediated upregulation of GCL transcription in CSE-treated cells were lost in Nrf2 siRNA-transfected cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling by LY294002 partially prevents ICT-induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and GCL transcription.

In this study, we evaluated the combination of 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), obtained from Alpinia galangal, and sodium butyrate, a major short chain fatty acid, on the growth of HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and found that treatment had a synergistic inhibitory effect. The number of HepG2 cells was synergistically decreased via apoptosis induction when cells were treated with both ACA and sodium butyrate. In ACA- and sodium butyrate-treated cells, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and NADPH oxidase activities were increased significantly. The decrease in cell number after combined treatment of ACA and sodium butyrate was diminished when cells were pretreated with catalase. These results suggest that an increase in intracellular ROS levels is involved in cancer cell death. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, plays an essential role in controlling processes related to tumor development. In ACA- and sodium butyrate-treated cells, AMPK phosphorylation was induced significantly, and this induction improved when cells were pretreated with catalase. These results suggest that the increase in intracellular ROS is involved in the increase of AMPK phosphorylation. In normal hepatocyte cells, treatment with ACA and sodium butyrate did not decrease cell numbers or increase ROS levels. In conclusion, combined treatment with ACA and sodium butyrate synergistically induced apoptotic cell death via an increase in intracellular ROS and phosphorylation of AMPK.

We focused our investigations on the antitumoral potential of amitriptyline in three human tumor cell lines: H460 (lung cancer), HeLa (cervical cancer), and HepG2 (hepatoma); comparing the cytotoxic effect of amitriptyline with three commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs: camptothecin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. We evaluated apoptosis, ROS production, mitochondrial mass and activity, and antioxidant defenses of tumor cells. Our results show that amitriptyline produces the highest cellular damage, inducing high levels of ROS followed by irreversible serious mitochondrial damage. Interestingly, an unexpected decrease in antioxidant machinery was observed only for amitriptyline. In conclusion, based on the capacity of generating ROS and inhibiting antioxidants in tumor cells, amitriptyline emerges as a promising new drug to be tested for anticancer therapy.",

We assessed cell differential in lavage fluid and evaluated two main functional parameters of AM phagocytic response, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and particle internalization.

Curcumin and resveratrol have been found to exhibit a synergistic anticancer effect in colon cancer. However, the combined effect of curcumin and resveratrol against hepatocellular carcinoma remains unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the combined effects of curcumin and resveratrol in hepatocellular carcinoma Hepa1-6 cells. The results showed that curcumin and resveratrol significantly inhibited the proliferation of Hepa1-6 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The combination treatment of curcumin and resveratrol elicited a synergistic antiproliferative effect in Hepa1-6 cells. The apoptosis of Hepa1-6 cells induced by the combination treatment with curcumin and resveratrol was accompanied by caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation, which was completely abrogated by a pan caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. Combination of curcumin and resveratrol upregulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in Hepa1-6 cells. The ROS scavenger, NAC, partially attenuated the apoptosis and caspase activation induced by the combination treatment of curcumin and resveratrol. In addition, the combination of curcumin and resveratrol downregulated XIAP and survivin expression.

Porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) have no detectable XDH/XO. This study was undertaken to examine 1) ROS production by hypoxic porcine PAEC and their mitochondria and 2) ROS production and injury in reoxygenated PAEC lacking XDH/XO activity. Intracellular H2O2 generation and extracellular H2O2 and O2 divided release were measured after exposure to normoxia (room air-5% CO2), hypoxia (0% O2-95% N-5% CO2), or hypoxia followed by normoxia or hyperoxia (95% O2-5% CO2). Exposure to hypoxia results in significant reductions in intracellular H2O2 formation and extracellular release of H2O2 and O2 by PAEC and mitochondria. The reductions occur with as little as a 2 h exposure and progress with continued exposure. During reoxygenation, cytotoxicity was not observed, and the production of ROS by PAEC and their mitochondria never exceeded levels observed in normoxic cells. The absence of XDH/XO may prevent porcine PAEC from developing injury and increased ROS production during reoxygenation.",

ROS generated due to oxidative stress can potentiate both cancer initiation and progression. Rotenone, which is an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, results in the activation of NOX2 and release of ROS, and has been shown to display anticancer activity through the induction of apoptosis in various cancer cells. The mechanistic link between rotenone-dependent activation of NOX2 and induction of apoptosis is still elusive. In this study, we used the human lung cancer A549 cells to study the molecular mechanism(s) involved between rotenone-dependent activation of NOX2 and impairment of autophagic machinery. We report that acute exposure to rotenone induced mild NOX2-dependnet oxidative stress, which impaired the autophagic flux, resulting in cytosolic accumulation of LC3 and p62/STSQM1. We further show that this induction occurs through the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. We furthermore show that chronic exposure to rotenone lead to excessive NOX2-dependent ROS generation, increases autophagy, and decreases p62 level via increased-autophagic flux. Taken together, this study is the first mechanistic elucidation of how rotenone can be used to potently target cancer cells without overhauling the entire cellular machinery. © 2016 IUBMB Life 68(5):388-393, 2016.

TXNL2 was found to be overexpressed in human cancers, including breast cancers. Knockdown of TXNL2 in human breast cancer cell lines increased ROS levels and reduced NF-κB activity, resulting in inhibition of in vitro proliferation, survival, and invasion. In addition, TXNL2 knockdown inhibited tumorigenesis and metastasis of these cells upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, analysis of primary breast cancer samples demonstrated that enhanced TXNL2 expression correlated with metastasis to the lung and brain and with decreased overall patient survival. Our studies provided insight into redox-based mechanisms underlying tumor growth and metastasis and suggest that TXNL2 could be a target for treatment of breast cancer.",

We showed that treatment with Gyp-L induces non-apoptotic and non-autophagic cytoplasmic vacuolation death in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Mechanically, Gyp-L initially increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which, in turn, triggered protein ubiquitination and unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in Ca(2+) release from endoplasm reticulum (ER) inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-operated stores and finally cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death. Interruption of the ROS-ER-Ca(2+) signaling pathway by chemical inhibitors significantly prevented Gyp-L-induced vacuole formation and cell death. In addition, Gyp-L-induced ER stress and vacuolation death required new protein synthesis. Overall, our works provide strong evidence for the anti-HCC activity of Gyp-L and suggest a novel therapeutic option by Gyp-L through the induction of a unconventional ROS-ER-Ca(2+)-mediated cytoplasmic vacuolation death in human HCC.

For experiments, male Wistar rats were submitted to FA inhalation (1%, 90 min daily) for 3 consecutive days. The treatments with apocynin and indomethacin before the FA exposure reduced the number of neutrophils recruited into the lung. Moreover, the treatments with apocynin and indomethacin blunted the effect of FA on the generation of IL-1β, while the treatments with L-NAME and apocynin reduced the generation of IL-6 by lung explants when compared to the untreated group. FA inhalation increased the levels of NO and hydrogen peroxide by BAL cells cultured and the treatments with apocynin and l-NAME reduced these generations. FA inhalation did not modify the activities of GPX, GR, GST and CAT but reduced the activity of SOD when compared to the naïve group. Significant increases in SOD-1 and -2, CAT, iNOS, cNOS and COX-1 expression were observed in the FA group compared to the naïve group. The treatments with apocynin, indomethacin and L-NAME reduced the gene expression of antioxidant and oxidant enzymes.

Not all smokers develop lung diseases associated with tobacco smoke, a fact that may reflect individual variation among human fibroblast strains. We hypothesize that fibroblasts from different human beings vary in their ability to undergo apoptosis after cigarette smoke exposure. This could account for emphysematous changes that occur in the lungs of some but not all smokers. Primary human lung fibroblast strains were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and assessed for viability, morphological changes, and mitochondrial transmembrane potential as indicators of apoptosis. We also examined the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and changes in glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels. Each human lung fibroblast strain exhibited a differential sensitivity to CSE as judged by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, viability, ROS generation, and glutathione production. Interestingly, the thiol antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine and GSH eliminated CSE-induced changes in fibroblast morphology such as membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and cell size and prevented alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and the generation of ROS. These findings support the concept that oxidative stress and apoptosis are responsible for fibroblast death associated with exposure to tobacco smoke.

Radiation pneumonitis is an acute phase side-effect which generally subsides after a few weeks and is followed by a chronic phase characterized by inflammation and fibrosis, that can develop months or years after irradiation. Carnosine is a dipeptide composed by the amino acids beta-histidine and l-alanine. The exact biological role of carnosine is not totally understood, but several studies have demonstrated that it possesses strong and specific antioxidant properties, protects against radiation damage,and promotes wound healing. The antioxidant mechanism of carnosine is attributed to its chelating effect against metal ions, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity, ROS and free radicals scavenging ability . Either its antioxidant or anti-inflammatuar properties, we propose that carnosine ameliorates irradiation-induced lung injury.

The oxidized phospholipid (OxPL) OxPAPC was identified to induce lung injury and cytokine production by lung macrophages via TLR4-TRIF. We observed OxPL production in the lungs of humans and animals infected with SARS, Anthrax, or H5N1. Pulmonary challenge with an inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus rapidly induces ALI and OxPL formation in mice. Loss of TLR4 or TRIF expression protects mice from H5N1-induced ALI. Moreover, deletion of ncf1, which controls ROS production, improves the severity of H5N1-mediated ALI. Our data identify oxidative stress and innate immunity as key lung injury pathways that control the severity of ALI.",

This study investigated the regulatory mechanism underlying adaphostin induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) which plays a significant role in modulation of drug-induced toxicity in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line model, NCI-H522.;The transcriptional response of NCI-H522 to adaphostin prominently involved oxidative stress genes, particularly HMOX1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement was additionally established by generation of ROS prior to modulation of adaphostin-toxicity with antioxidants. To identify up-stream regulatory elements of HMOX1, immunofluorescence was used to evaluate nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), in the presence of adaphostin. The PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, was employed as a pharmacological inhibitor of this process.;Generation of ROS provided a substantial foundation for the sensitivity of NCI-H522 to adaphostin. However, in contrast to leukemia cell lines, transcriptional response to oxidative stress was associated with induction of HMOX1, which was dependent on nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, Nrf2. Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin inhibited translocation of Nrf2 and induction of HMOX1. Wortmannin pretreatment was also able to diminish adaphostin induction of HMOX1, and as a consequence, enhance the toxicity of adaphostin to NCI-H522.;Adaphostin-induced oxidative stress in NCI-H522 was mediated through nuclear translocation of Nrf2 leading to upregulation of HMOX1. Inhibition of Nrf2 translocation by wortmannin inhibited this cytoprotective response, and enhanced the toxicity of adaphostin, suggesting that inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, such as wortmannin, might augment the antiproliferative effects of adaphostin in solid tumors that depend on the Nrf2/ARE pathway for protection against oxidative stress.",

We previously demonstrated that particulate matter (PM) exposure triggers massive oxidative stress in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), resulting in the loss of EC integrity and lung vascular hyperpermeability. We investigated the protective role of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous gaseous molecule present in the circulation, on PM-induced human lung EC barrier disruption and pulmonary inflammation. Alterations in EC monolayer permeability, as reflected by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER), the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and murine pulmonary inflammatory responses, were studied after exposures to PM and NaSH, an H(2)S donor. Similar to N-acetyl cysteine (5 mM), NaSH (10 μM) significantly scavenged PM-induced EC ROS and inhibited the oxidative activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Concurrent with these events, NaSH (10 μM) activated Akt, which helps maintain endothelial integrity. Both of these pathways contribute to the protective effect of H(2)S against PM-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, NaSH (20 mg/kg) reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in a murine model of PM-induced lung inflammation. These data suggest a potentially protective role for H(2)S in PM-induced inflammatory lung injury and vascular hyperpermeability.",

Here, we investigated the anti-cancer activities of OEL in human lung cancer cells. Our studies demonstrated that OEL induced both apoptosis and autophagy in A549 and H460 cells. OEL-induced autophagy was assessed by appearance of autophagic vacuoles, formation of acidic vesicular organelles, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, recruitment of LC3-II to the autophagosomes, and activation of autophagy genes. Furthermore, administration of autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine augments OEL-induced apoptotic cell death. The induction of autophagy and apoptosis by OEL links to NF-κB activation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interruption of NF-κB activation by specific inhibitor promotes apoptosis, but decreases autophagy. ROS antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine) attenuated both OEL-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Further experiments confirmed that OEL-induced activation of ROS was increased by NF-κB inhibitor whereas NF-κB activation was not affected by ROS inhibition. These findings suggest that OEL-elicited autophagic response plays a protective role that impedes cell death, and inhibition of autophagy could be an adjunctive strategy for enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect of OEL as an antitumor agent.

However the manufacture and extensive use of nanotubes raises concern about its safe use and human health. Very few studies have been carried out on toxicity of carbon nanotubes in experimental animals and humans, thus resulted in limiting their use. The extensive toxicological studies using in vitro and in vivo models are necessary and are required to establish safe manufacturing guidelines and also the use of SWCNT. These studies also help the chemists to prepare derivative of SWCNT with less or no toxicity. The present study was undertaken to determine the toxicity exhibited by SWCNT in rat lung epithelial cells as a model system. Lung epithelial cells (LE cells) were cultured with or without SWCNT and reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced were measured by change in fluorescence using dichloro fluorescein (DCF). The results show increased ROS on exposure to SWCNT in a dose and time dependent manner. The decrease in glutathione content suggested the depletion and loss of protective mechanism against ROS in SWCNT treated cells. Use of rotenone, the inhibitor of mitochondrial function have no effect on ROS levels suggested that mitochondria is not involved in SWCNT induced ROS production. Studies carried out on the effect of SWCNT on superoxide dismutase (SOD-1 and SOD-2) levels in LE cells, indicates that these enzyme levels decreased by 24 hours. The increased ROS induced by SWCNT on LE cells decreased by treating the cells with 1 mM of glutathione, N-Acetyl Cysteine, and Vitamin C. These results further prove that SWCNT induces oxidative stress in LE cells and shows loss of antioxidants.",

Scavenging superoxide with Tiron eliminated the stretch-induced increase in cell monolayer permeability, and similar results were reported for rats ventilated at large tidal volumes, suggesting that oxidative stress plays an important role in barrier impairment in ventilator-induced lung injury associated with large stretch and tidal volumes. In this communication we show that mechanisms that involve oxidative injury are also present in a novel precision cut lung slices (PCLS) model under identical mechanical loads. PCLSs from healthy rats were stretched cyclically to 37% change in surface area for 1 hour. Superoxide was visualized using MitoSOX. To evaluate functional relationships, in separate stretch studies superoxide was scavenged using Tiron or mito-Tempo. PCLS and RAEC permeability was assessed as tight junction (TJ) protein (occludin, claudin-4 and claudin-7) dissociation from zona occludins-1 (ZO-1) via co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot, after 1h (PCLS) or 10min (RAEC) of stretch. Superoxide was increased significantly in PCLS, and Tiron and mito-Tempo dramatically attenuated the response, preventing claudin-4 and claudin-7 dissociation from ZO-1. Using a novel PCLS model for ventilator-induced lung injury studies, we have shown that uniform, biaxial, cyclic stretch generates ROS in the slices, and that superoxide scavenging that can protect the lung tissue under stretch conditions. We conclude that PCLS offer a valuable platform for investigating antioxidant treatments to prevent ventilation-induced lung injury. ",

However, the exact cellular and molecular responses of epithelial cells to silica exposure remain unclear. We hypothesize that non-oxidant-mediated silica-cell interactions lead to the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), whereby TNF-alpha-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to the activation of the monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 genes. Using a murine alveolar type II cell line, murine lung epithelial (MLE)-15, we measured the early changes in TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and MIP-2 mRNA species after exposure of the cells to 18 micrograms/cm2 silica (cristobalite) in combination with various antioxidants. Total mRNA was isolated and assayed using an RNase protection assay after 6 h of particle exposure. We found that extracellular GSH could completely attenuate the cristobalite-induced expression of MCP-1 and MIP-2 mRNAs, whereas TNF-alpha mRNA levels were unaltered. We also found using the oxidant-sensitive dye 6-carboxy-2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate di(acetoxymethyl ester) that treatment of MLE-15 cells with cristobalite and TNF-alpha (1 ng/ml) resulted in ROS production. This ROS production could be inhibited with extracellular GSH treatment, and in the case of cristobalite-induced ROS, inhibition was also achieved with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody. The results support the hypothesis that TNF-alpha mediates cristobalite-induced MCP-1 and MIP-2 expression through the generation of ROS.",

Our results revealed that bleomycin induced the activation of PLD and generation of PA in a dose-dependent (5, 10, and 100 µg) and time-dependent (2-12 hours) fashion that were significantly attenuated by the PLD-specific inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI).

Furthermore, our study demonstrated the formation of ROS and loss of glutathione (GSH) in cells following bleomycin treatment, confirming oxidative stress as a key player in the bleomycin-induced PLD activation and PA generation in ECs. More noticeably, PLD activation and PA generation were observed to happen upstream of bleomycin-induced cytotoxicity in BLMVECs, which was protected by FIPI. This was also supported by our current findings that exposure of cells to exogenous PA led to internalization of PA and cytotoxicity in BLMVECs.

This study examined the effects of a LPS treatment on the intracellular calcium levels ([Ca(2+)]i) as well as the specific mechanisms of LPS-induced cell death in pneumocytes. In addition, the effects of taurine on the LPS-induced increase in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pneumocytes were investigated. The [Ca(2+)]i in cultured pneumocytes was determined using microfluorescence techniques. The level of activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Bax protein were measured by Western blotting. LPS at 10 and 100 ng/ml induced cell death and decreased the viability of MRC-5 cells. Moreover, the intracellular Ca(2+) and ROS levels were increased by LPS. The LPS treatment led to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and the activation of Bax. A pretreatment with 20 mM taurine reduced the LPS-induced production of ROS and MARK activity. These results show that a LPS treatment induces cell death in MRC-5 cells by increasing the intracellular ROS and Ca(2+) levels. The increase in the intracellular level of ROS promotes MAPKs activation and Bax translocation. Overall, LPS induces lung cell death by activating MAPKs. Furthermore, taurine decreased the LPS-induced generation of ROS and activation of MAPK and Bax.",

The most common clinical manifestations in patients with G6PD deficiency are neonatal jaundice and acute hemolytic anemia. The effects of microbial infection in patients with G6PD deficiency primarily relate to the hemolytic anemia caused by Plasmodium or viral infections and the subsequent medication that is required. We are interested in studying the impact of bacterial infection in G6PD-deficient cells. G6PD knock down A549 lung carcinoma cells, together with the common pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, were employed in our cell infection model. Here, we demonstrate that a lower cell viability was observed among G6PD-deficient cells when compared to scramble controls upon bacterial infection using the MTT assay. A significant increase in the intracellular ROS was detected among S. aureus-infected G6PD-deficient cells by observing dichlorofluorescein (DCF) intensity within cells under a fluorescence microscope and quantifying this signal using flow cytometry. The impairment of ROS removal is predicted to enhance apoptotic activity in G6PD-deficient cells, and this enhanced apoptosis was observed by annexin V/PI staining under a confocal fluorescence microscope and quantified by flow cytometry. A higher expression level of the intrinsic apoptotic initiator caspase-9, as well as the downstream effector caspase-3, was detected by Western blotting analysis of G6PD-deficient cells following bacterial infection. In conclusion, we propose that bacterial infection, perhaps the secreted S. aureus α-hemolysin in this case, promotes the accumulation of intracellular ROS in G6PD-deficient cells. This would trigger a stronger apoptotic activity through the intrinsic pathway thereby reducing cell viability when compared to wild type cells. ",

Osthole, an active component in Chinese herbal medicine, has drawn increasing attention because of its various pharmacological functions, including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of osthole on ALI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through intratracheal instillation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) and the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) were detected by real-time PCR, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. ROS production was measured by flow cytometry. Our results showed that osthole treatment improved the mice survival rates in the middle and high dosage groups, compared with the untreated LPS group. Moreover, osthole treatment significantly improved LPS-induced lung pathological damage, and it decreased the lung injury scores, lung wet/dry ratios and the total protein level in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Osthole treatment dramatically reduced the H2O2, MDA and OH levels in the lung homogenates. LDH and ROS were markedly reduced in the osthole+LPS group in vitro. Furthermore, osthole increased Nrf2 and Trx1 expression in terms of mRNA and protein in vivo and in vitro. Nrf2 siRNA (siNrf2) could suppress the beneficial effects of osthole on ALI. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that osthole exerted protective effects on LPS-induced ALI by up-regulating the Nrf-2/Trx-1 pathway. ",

Incubating the HCC cell with ApoG2 abrogated the interaction of Beclin-1 and Bcl-2/xL, stimulated ROS generation, increased phosphorylation of ERK and JNK, and HMGB1 translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm while suppressing mTOR. Moreover, inhibition of the ROS-mediated autophagy by antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) potentiates ApoG2-induced apoptosis and cell killing. Our results show that ApoG2 induced protective autophagy in HCC cells, partly due to ROS generation, suggesting that antioxidant may serve as a potential chemosensitizer to enhance cancer cell death through blocking ApoG2-stimulated autophagy.

Ligand-binding studies ([125I]Tyr11-SRIH) demonstrated mean dissociation constants ranging from 114-224 pmol/L, and 20-154 fmol/mg membrane protein mean receptor sites, in cell lines. Four cell lines were grown for 3 days in monolayers with SRIH analogs (octreotide or MK0678) at concentrations from 0.05-100 nmol/L in serum-free medium to assess changes in cell numbers. At the highest dose, MK0678 produced dose-dependent inhibition of growth in RO 87-M-1 and NPA87, each to about 70% of that in control cells. Octreotide produced dose-dependent stimulation of growth in RO 87-M-1 cells, but caused growth inhibition in NPA87 cells, with loss of effect at the highest dose. RO 82-W-1 did not respond to MK0678, yet caused biphasic inhibition with octreotide (75% and 45% of control cell numbers at 0.05 and 100 nmol/L doses, respectively). Anaplastic cells, RO 90-D-1, did not respond to either analog despite similar ligand binding. Addition of epidermal growth factor (100 micrograms/L) or TSH (200 mU/L) increased the sensitivity of RO 87-M-1 cells to growth inhibition by the lowest dose of MK0678, producing biphasic dose-response curves. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate specific SRIH binding to membranes of thyroid carcinoma cells and tissues as well as discordant growth effects of different SRIH analogs on the same cell lines. This may be a result of differential stimulation and regulation of distinct SRIH receptor subtypes.",

No significant difference regarding the performance of different antibody clones toward these driver mutations was observed, except that clone SP125 showed a higher sensitivity than 43B2 in the detection of p.L858R of EGFR.;In circumstances such as poor quality of nucleic acids or low content of tumor cells, IHC of EGFR mutation-specific antibodies could be used as an alternative method.

It has been reported that an extract of prostatic carcinoma and conditioned medium (CM) of a human prostatic carcinoma cell line, PC-3, established from a bone metastastic lesion, stimulate osteoblastic cell proliferation. However, there is little information about the effect of PC-3 CM on the differentiation of osteoblastic cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of PC-3 CM on the differentiation of two types of osteoblastic cells, primary fetal rat calvaria (RC) cells containing many undifferentiated osteoprogenitor cells, and ROS 17/2.8, a well-differentiated rat osteosarcoma cell line. PC-3 CM inhibited bone nodule formation and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALPase), an osteoblastic marker enzyme, on days 7, 14, and 21 (RC cells) or 3, 6, and 9 (ROS 17/2.8 cells) in a dose-dependent manner (5-30% CM). However, the CM did not affect cell proliferation or cell viability. PC-3 CM was found to markedly block the gene expression of ALPase and osteocalcin (OCN) mRNAs but had no effect on the mRNA expression of osteopontin (OPN), the latter two being noncollagenous proteins related to bone matrix mineralization. These findings suggest that PC-3 CM contains a factor that inhibits osteoblastic cell differentiation and that this factor may be involved in the process of bone metastasis from prostatic carcinoma.",

After preliminary screening for cytotoxicity for RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells, the non-toxic compounds were tested for anti-inflammatory activity using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 cells. Compounds 1h, 1i, and 1n reduced LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production, with respective ED50 values of 15 ± 2, 16 ± 2, and 17 ± 2 µM. They also reduced expression of inducible NO synthase and interleukin-6 (IL-6) without affecting cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Compound 1h also reduced secretion of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α by LPS-activated J774A.1 murine macrophage cells, primary mice peritoneal macrophages, and JAWSII murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and reduced NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion by LPS + adenosine triphosphate-activated J774A.1 and JAWSII cells. The underlying mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory activity of compound 1h were found to be a decrease in LPS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and NF-κB activation and a decrease in ATP-induced ROS production and PKC-α phosphorylation. These results provide promising insights into the anti-inflammatory activity of these conjugated polyenes and a molecular rationale for future therapeutic intervention in inflammation-related diseases.

The main biochemical and molecular alterations that are responsible for the syndrome are prematurely present in the progress of the disease and the identification of the early stages of cachexia can be useful in targetting patients who will benefit from early treatment. The aim of the present study was to delineate the bio-humoral profile of a group of lung cancer patients either non-cachectic or cachectic by evaluating serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress/antioxidant parameters (both recognized to be involved in cachexia pathogenesis) and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in PBMC (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells) of cancer patients. All serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress/antioxidant parameters significantly increased in neoplastic patients, but only TNF-alpha, ROS, GSH and vitamin E showed a significantly greater increase in cachectic patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression mirrored serum level behaviour except for IL-6 that was increased in serum but not as gene expression, suggesting its provenience from tumour tissue. Our data support that the simultaneous determination of ROS, GSH, vitamin E, together with TNF-alpha allows the identification of a lung cancer patient developing cancer-related cachexia. This bio-humoral profile should be used for the early diagnosis and follow-up of the syndrome. Moreover, the evaluation of gene expression in patient PBMC was helpful in differentiating tumour vs host factors, therefore being useful in the study of pathogenetic mechanisms in neoplastic cachectic patients.",

In the present study the authors hypothesized that cadmium exposure inducts changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that may be involved in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. The pathological changes of different pulmonary cells of ROS-cadmium-dependent effects were investigated in relation to the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Twelve animals were randomly assigned to two groups, control and experimental. The experimental group underwent ingestion of cadmium mixed with diet (200 mg/kg) for 7 weeks. Following the treatment conditions for each group, blood samples were collected and animals were sacrificed and the lung was isolated. Ultrastructure examination showed that cadmium resulted in desquamated pneumocyte type II with degenerated surfactant materials, thickened alveolar wall, and thickening of alveolar septum due to proliferation of endothelial cells lining the pulmonary capillaries as a result of an active transmigration. t-test results showed that cadmium caused a significant (p < .05) rise in leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes, which was a sign for chemotactic activity that enhanced transmigration from pulmonary microcirculation into inflammated tissue. In addition, lung tissue FR production, LDH, and GPx activities increased significantly (p < .05) from the baseline control of 88.17+/-17.70, 183.49+/-29.50, and 4466.79+/-1190.32 to 129.67+/-14.49.14 (Carr U), 339.17+/-75.28 (U/L), and 5943.08+/-695 (U/L) respectively, in the cadmium-treated group. Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that long-term cadmium exposure (ingestion mixed with food) results in cadmium deposition in the tissue of the vasculature of the lungs, such as pulmonary capillary endothelial, which induced the buildup of ROS, a possible proposed new mechanism that explains lung inflammation.",

The involvement of these intracellular effectors in PAR1/4-initiated migratory signalling was further supported by the findings that individual stimulation of Hep3B cells with the PAR1-AP and the PAR4-AP induced an increase in ROS production and the transactivation of Met and PDGFR. In addition, PAR1- and PAR4-mediated inhibition of total PTP activity and specifically PTP1B. ROS inhibition by N-acetyl-L-cysteine prevented the inhibition of PTP1B phosphatase activity induced by PAR1-AP and the PAR4-AP, but had no effect on PAR1/4-mediated activation of Met and PDGFR in Hep3B cells.;Collectively, our data indicate that PAR1 and PAR4 activate common promigratory signalling pathways in Hep3B liver carcinoma cells including activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases Met and PDGFR, the formation of ROS and the inactivation of PTP1B. However, PAR1/4-triggered Met and PDGFR transactivation seem to be mediated independently from the ROS-PTP1B signalling module.",

Exposure of the lung to hyperoxia is known to increase the production of ROS by mitochondria. We hypothesized that macrophages may also be a major contributor to this increase. Newborn rat pups were exposed to either air or 60% O(2) for 14 d and received either intraperitoneal gadolinium chloride (GdCl(3)) to abrogate macrophage influx, or inert vehicle. Lung homogenates were equilibrated in either 21% or 100% O(2) and total and cyanide-insensitive O(2) consumption, as well as nitric oxide accumulation were measured polarographically. Citrate synthase, a marker of mitochondrial mass, and nitrotyrosine, a marker of peroxynitrite formation, were quantified by Western blot. In addition to increased macrophage numbers, the lungs of 60% O(2)-exposed animals had greatly increased cyanide-insensitive O(2) consumption (p <.05 compared to air controls) and immunoreactive nitrotyrosine (p <.05), which were all completely abrogated by treatment with GdCl(3). Exposure to 60% O(2) for 14 d had no effect on peroxynitrite-independent nitric oxide release or mitochondrial mass. We conclude that increased ROS in the lungs of newborn rats exposed to 60% O(2) for 14 d was likely to be caused, in significant part, by the presence of increased numbers of macrophages.",

Sprague-Dawley rats were intratracheally dosed (i.t.) at day 0 with ROFA (R-Total) (1.0 mg/100 g body weight), the soluble fraction of ROFA (R-Soluble), the soluble sample subject to a chelator (R-Chelex), or phosphate-buffered saline (Saline). On day 3, rats were administered an i.t. dose of 5 x 10(4)Listeria monocytogenes. On days 6, 8, and 10, bacterial pulmonary clearance was monitored and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on days 3 (pre-infection), 6, 8, and 10. A concentrated first fraction of lavage fluid was retained for analysis of lactate dehydrogenase and albumin to assess lung injury. BAL cell number, phenotype, and production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) were assessed, and a variety of cytokines were measured in the BAL fluid. Rats pre-treated with R-Soluble showed elevated lung injury/cytotoxicity and increased cellular influx into the lungs. R-Soluble-treatment also altered ROS, RNS, and cytokine levels, and caused a degree of macrophage and T cell inhibition. These effects of R-Soluble result in increased pulmonary bacterial burden after infection. The results suggest that soluble metals in ROFA increase lung injury and inflammation, and alter both innate and adaptive pulmonary immune responses.",

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia leads to the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause acute inflammatory lung injury. One of the major effects of hyperoxia is the injury and death of pulmonary epithelium, which is accompanied by increased levels of pulmonary proinflammatory cytokines and excessive leukocyte infiltration. A thorough understanding of the signaling pathways leading to pulmonary epithelial cell injury/death may provide some insights into the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury. This review focuses on epithelial responses to hyperoxia and some of the major factors regulating pathways to epithelial cell injury/death, and proinflammatory responses on exposure to hyperoxia. We discuss in detail some of the most interesting players, such as NF-kappaB, that can modulate both proinflammatory responses and cell injury/death of lung epithelial cells. A better appreciation for the functions of these factors will no doubt help us to delineate the pathways to hyperoxic cell death and proinflammatory responses.",

The objective of the present work was to decipher the effect of CuNG on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant enzymes in normal and doxorubicin-resistant Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC/Dox)-bearing Swiss albino mice.;The effect of CuNG has been studied on ROS generation, multidrug resistance-associated protein1 (MRP1) expression and on activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).;CuNG increased ROS generation and reduced MRP1 expression in EAC/Dox cells while only temporarily depleted glutathione (GSH) within 2 h in heart, kidney, liver and lung of EAC/Dox bearing mice, which were restored within 24 h. The level of liver Cu was observed to be inversely proportional to the level of GSH. Moreover, CuNG modulated SOD, CAT and GPx in different organs and thereby reduced oxidative stress. Thus nontoxic dose of CuNG may be utilized to reduce MRP1 expression and thus sensitize EAC/Dox cells to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, CuNG modulated SOD, CAT and and GPx activities to reduce oxidative stress in some vital organs of EAC/Dox bearing mice.

Emerging evidence suggests that tumor metastasis and recurrence might be driven by a small subpopulation of stemness cells, so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs). Previous investigations have revealed that glioma and breast CSCs exhibit intrinsically low proteasome activity and that breast CSCs also reportedly contain a lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) level than corresponding nontumorigenic cells. Here we visualized two stem cell features, low proteasome activity and low intracellular ROS, in HCC cells using two-color fluorescence activated cell sorting to isolate cells with stem cell features. These cells were then analyzed for their division behavior in normoxia and hypoxia, expression of stem cell markers, tumorigenicity, metastatic potential, specific gene expression signatures, and their clinical implications. A visualized small subpopulation of HCC cells demonstrated asymmetric divisions. Their remarkable tumorigenicity in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice suggested the cancer initiation potential of these HCC CSCs. Comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed that chemokine-related genes were up-regulated in the CSCs subpopulation. Our identified HCC CSCs facilitated the migration of macrophages in vitro and demonstrated metastatic potential by way of recruitment of macrophages in vivo. In patients who undergo curative operation for HCC, the CSC-specific gene signature in the liver microenvironment significantly correlates with recurrence.;Based on these findings, the stem cell feature monitoring system proposed here is a promising tool to analyze the in vivo significance of CSC microenvironments in human HCCs.",

Studies have shown that oncogenic ras is not only able to promote cell growth or survival, but also apoptosis, depending upon circumstances. Using pancreatic cancer cell lines with or without expressing mutated K-ras, we demonstrated that the inhibition of endogenous PKC activity sensitized human pancreatic cancer cells (MIA and PANC-1) expressing mutated K-ras to apoptosis, which had no apoptotic effect on BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells that contain a normal Ras as well as human lung epithelial BAES-2B cells. In this apoptotic process, the level of ROS was increased and PUMA was upregulated in a p73-dependent fashion in MIA and PANC-1 cells. Subsequently, caspase-3 was cleaved. A full induction of apoptosis required the activation of both ROS- and p73-mediated pathways. The data suggest that PKC is a crucial factor that copes with aberrant K-ras to maintain the homeostasis of the pancreatic cancer cells harboring mutated K-ras.

To determine alveolar epithelial responses to acid, we viewed live alveoli of the isolated lung by fluorescence microscopy, then we microinjected the alveoli with HCl at pH of 1.5. The microinjection caused an immediate but transient formation of molecule-scale pores in the apical alveolar membrane, resulting in loss of cytosolic dye. However, the membrane rapidly resealed. There was no cell damage and no further dye loss despite continuous HCl injection. Concomitantly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased in the adjacent perialveolar microvascular endothelium in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. By contrast, ROS did not increase in wild-type mice in which we gave intra-alveolar injections of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-catalase, in mice overexpressing alveolar catalase, or in mice lacking functional NADPH oxidase (Nox2). Together, our findings indicate the presence of an unusual proinflammatory mechanism in which alveolar contact with acid caused membrane pore formation. The effect, although transient, was nevertheless sufficient to induce Ca(2+) entry and Nox2-dependent H(2)O(2) release from the alveolar epithelium. These responses identify alveolar H(2)O(2) release as the signaling mechanism responsible for lung inflammation induced by acid and suggest that intra-alveolar PEG-catalase might be therapeutic in acid-induced lung injury.",

We found previously that lung GM-CSF is dramatically suppressed in mice exposed to hyperoxia. Alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) are a major source of GM-CSF in the peripheral lung, and in vivo hyperoxia resulted in greatly reduced expression of GM-CSF protein by AEC ex vivo. We now explore the mechanisms responsible for this effect, using primary cultures of murine AEC exposed to hyperoxia in vitro. Exposure of AEC to 80% oxygen/5% CO(2) for 48 h did not induce overt toxicity, but resulted in significantly decreased GM-CSF protein and mRNA expression compared with cells in normoxia. Similar effects were seen when AEC were stressed with serum deprivation, an alternative inducer of oxidative stress. The effects in AEC were opposite those in a murine lung epithelial cell line (MLE-12 cells), in which hyperoxia induced GM-CSF expression. Both hyperoxia and serum deprivation resulted in increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AEC. Hyperoxia and serum deprivation induced significantly accelerated turnover of GM-CSF mRNA. Treatment of AEC with catalase during oxidative stress preserved GM-CSF protein and mRNA and was associated with stabilization of GM-CSF mRNA. We conclude that hyperoxia-induced suppression of AEC GM-CSF expression is a function of ROS-induced destabilization of GM-CSF mRNA. We speculate that AEC oxidative stress results in significantly impaired pulmonary innate immune defense due to effects on local GM-CSF expression in the lung.",

Both National Cancer Institute (NCI) and NTP have expressed great concern on the potential genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of dienaldehydes. Trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE or 2,4-De), a specific type of dienaldehyde, is abundant in heated oils and has been associated with lung adenocarcinoma development in women due to their exposure to oil fumes during cooking. Cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B cells) were exposed to 0.1 or 1.0 microM tt-DDE for 45 days, and oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, GSH/GSSG ratio, cell proliferation, and expression of TNFalpha and IL-1beta were measured. The results show that tt-DDE induced oxidative stress, an increase in ROS production, and a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio (glutathione status) in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of BEAS-2B cells with 1.0 microM tt-DDE for 45 days increased cell proliferation and the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha and IL-1beta. Cotreatment of BEAS-2B cells with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevented tt-DDE-induced cell proliferation and release of cytokines. Therefore, these results suggest that tt-DDE-induced changes may be due to increased ROS production and enhanced oxidative stress. Since increased cell proliferation and the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are believed to be involved in tumor promotion, our results suggest that tt-DDE may play a role in cancer promotion.

Moreover, the levels of ROS and mROS evoked by hypoxia were regulated by DRP1. Furthermore, we verified the apoptosis suppression of PASMCs under hypoxia due to the interaction between ROS/mROS and DRP1.

        "Doc_abstract":"As an efficient method for inducing tumor cell apoptosis, ROS can be constantly formed and accumulated in NADPH oxidase overactivated-cells, resulting in further mitochondrial membrane damage and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. In addition, JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK MAPK) signal also acts as a vital candidate pathway for inducing tumor cell apoptosis by targeting mitochondrial death pathway. However, the relationship between NADPH oxidase-ROS and JNK MAPK signal still remains unclear. Here, we discovered a novel self-driven signal circuit between NADPH oxidase-ROS and JNK MAPK, which was induced by a cytotoxic steroidal saponin (ASC) in hepatoma carcinoma cells. NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production was markedly activated by ASC and directly led to JNK MAPK activation. Moreover, antioxidant, NADPH oxidase inhibitor and specific knock-out for p47 subunit of NADPH oxidase could effectively block NADPH oxidase-ROS-dependent JNK activation, suggesting that NADPH oxidase is an upstream regulator of JNK MAPK. Conversely, a specific JNK inhibitor could inhibit ASC-induced NADPH oxidase activation and down-regulate ROS levels as well, indicating that JNK might also regulate NADPH oxidase activity to some extent. These observations indicate that NADPH oxidase and JNK MAPK activate each other as a signal circuit. Furthermore, drug pretreatment experiments with ASC showed this signal circuit operated continuously via a self-driven mode and finally induced apoptosis in hepatoma carcinoma cells. Taken together, we provide a proof for inducing hepatoma carcinoma cell apoptosis by activating the JNK-NADPH oxidase-ROS-dependent self-driven signal circuit pathway. ",

We evaluated FS in a murine model of pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) by dietary supplementation of 0% (control) or 10% (treatment) FS before IRI. Mice fed 0% FS undergoing IRI had a significant decrease in arterial oxygenation (Pa(O(2))) and a significant increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein compared with sham-operated mice. However, mice fed 10% FS undergoing IRI had a significant improvement in both Pa(O(2)) and BAL protein compared with mice fed 0% FS undergoing IRI. In addition, oxidative lung damage was decreased in 10% FS-supplemented mice undergoing IRI, as assessed by malondialdehyde levels. Immunohistochemical staining of lungs for iPF(2alpha)-III F(2) isoprostane, a measure of lipid oxidation, was diminished. FS-supplemented mice had less reactive oxygen species (ROS) release from the vascular endothelium in lungs in an ex vivo model of IRI, and alveolar macrophages isolated from FS-fed mice had significantly reduced ROS generation in response to oxidative burst. Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells produced less ROS in a flow cessation model of ischemia when preincubated with purified FS lignan metabolites. Pharmacological inhibition of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) resulted in only a partial reduction of FS protection in the same model. We conclude that dietary FS is protective against IRI in an experimental murine model and that FS affects ROS generation and ROS detoxification via pathways not limited to upregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1.",

Previously, we have shown that TiO2 NPs induces endothelial cell dysfunction and damage in glial cells. Considering that inhaled particles can induce systemic effects and the evidence that nanoparticles may translocate out of the lungs, we evaluated whether different types of TiO2 NPs can induce the expression of receptors for adhesion molecules on monocytes (U937 cell line). We evaluated the role of reactive oxygen spices (ROS) on these effects.;The expression of receptors for early (sLe(x) and PSGL-1) and late (LFA-1, VLA-4 and αVβ3) adhesion molecules was evaluated in U937 cells on a time course (3-24 h) using a wide range of concentrations (0.001-100 μg/mL) of three types of TiO2 NPs (<25 nm anatase, 50 nm anatase-rutile or < 100 nm anatase). Cells exposed to TNFα were considered positive controls, and unexposed cells, negative controls. In some experiments we added 10 μmolar of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to evaluate the role of ROS.;All tested particles, starting at a concentration of 0.03 μg/mL, induced the expression of receptors for early and late adhesion molecules. The largest increases were induced by the different molecules after 3 h of exposure for sLe(x) and PSGL-1 (up to 3-fold of the positive controls) and after 18 h of exposure for LFA-1, VLA-4 and αVβ3 (up to 2.5-fold of the positive controls). Oxidative stress was observed as early as 10 min after exposure, but the maximum peak was found after 4 h of exposure. Adhesion of exposed or unexposed monocytes to unexposed or exposed endothelial cells was tested, and we observed that monocytes cells adhere in similar amounts to endothelial cells if one of the two cell types, or both were exposed. When NAC was added, the expression of the receptors was inhibited.;These results show that small concentrations of particles may activate monocytes that attach to endothelial cells. These results suggest that distal effects can be induced by small amounts of particles that may translocate from the lungs.

Moderate serum NSE elevation has been reported in some patients with benign lung diseases. We decided to investigate whether the elevation of serum NSE in non-neoplastic lung diseases is connected with hypoxemia and to what extent the recovery of sufficient ventilation with a respirator may influence NSE concentrations. Serum NSE was estimated by means of radioimmunoassay in 83 patients with various non-neoplastic lung diseases. Serum NSE exceeding 12.5 micrograms/L was significantly more frequent in patients with marked hypoxemia (PaO2 < 6.67 kPa; p = 0.03) than in others. The median NSE value in the group of patients without respiratory failure (Ro) was 7.2 micrograms/L (10% > 12.5 micrograms/L), in the group of patients with respiratory failure not requiring mechanical ventilation (Rf) it was 8.5 micrograms/L (24% > 12.5 micrograms/L), and in the group of patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (Rfv) 13.1 micrograms/L (60% > 12.5 micrograms/L). The differences between the Rfv group and the other two groups (Rf and Ro) were significant (P = 0.049 and p = 0.0004, respectively). During successful mechanical ventilation elevated serum NSE decreased to values below the cutoff in 8/10 patients.

In a separate set of experiments, the neonatal rat pups were exposed to 21% or >95% O2 for 14 days with or without intraperitoneal administration of SP. On day 14, the animals were sacrificed and the lungs were processed for histology and biochemical analysis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used for the detection of apoptosis. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), oxidative stress was assessed by determining the extent of formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), activities of NADPH oxidase activity, and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The activity of phospho-p38 (p-p38) and -ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) proteins and expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) were detected by Western blot, and the expression of p-p38 was detected by immunofluorescence analysis. Compared with the hyperoxia treatment, the lung damage was significantly ameliorated following the SP treatment. Furthermore, the lungs from the pups exposed to hyperoxia TUNEL-positive nuclei increased markedly and decreased significantly after SP treatment. The levels of MDA decreased and that of GSH-Px and SOD increased following the SP treatment. The SP treatment significantly suppressed the activity of NADPH oxidase and reduced ROS production. SP stimulation may result in blocking p38 MAPK and ERK signaling pathways, and the activities of p-p38 and p-ERK, and expression of NRF2 decreased following the SP treatment. These findings indicate that SP can ameliorate hyperoxic lung injury through decreasing cell apoptosis, elevating antioxidant activities, and attenuating oxidative stress.",

AY4 induced death of C-643, U-HTH 7, HTH83, and SW1736 cells. To elucidate the role of ROS generation in AY4-induced apoptosis of ATC cells, U-HTH 7 and SW1736 cells were pretreated with an antioxidant (N-acetyl cysteine, NAC) followed by AY4 treatment.

To examine the link between the apoptotic response and Bcl-xL protein expression, U-HTH 7 cells were transfected with Bcl-xL plasmid. The consequence of the overexpression of Bcl-xL appeared to decrease AY4-mediated cell death by blocking ROS generation in U-HTH 7 cells. By contrast, Bcl-xL knockdown using small interfering RNA of Bcl-xL enhanced AY4 sensitivity in HTH83 and C-643 cells and rendered the cells sensitive to AY4-induced cell death.

The intracellular ROS formation was determined by following the oxidative production of 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), and anti-nitrotyrosine antibody immunofluorescence. Histamine was assayed using a fluorometric analyzer, leukotrienes by radioimmunoassay, intracellular Ca2+ levels by confocal scanning microscopy, and PLA(2) activity using prelabeling of [3H]arachidonic acid.;ROS detected by DCFH-DA weakly increased in mast cells activated with OVA (1.0 g/ml), and the ROS so generated was inhibited by ebselen (50 microM).

The animals received endotracheally a single dose of BLM (2.5 U/kg body weight dissolved in 0.25 ml of 0.9% NaCl) or saline (0.9% NaCl) and were divided into eight groups (n=8): saline; BLM; saline+NAC; BLM+NAC; saline+DFX; BLM+DFX; saline+NAC+DFX; BLM+NAC+DFX. Treatments with NAC (20mg/kg) or DFX (30 mg/kg) were administered for 60 days after BLM exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and total cell count, neutrophil and protein concentration were determined in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lipid peroxidation thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), oxidative protein damage (carbonyl contents), and catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were determined in the lung tissue. BLM administration resulted in lung lesion as determinated lung histology, which is almost completely prevented by NAC plus DFX. The results of total cell counts and neutrophils and LDH increased after BLM exposure and were reduced with NAC. DFX and NAC plus DFX also caused a significant decrease of LDH activity. The increased malondialdehyde equivalents and carbonyl contents in lung tissue produced by BLM were also prevented by NAC plus DFX. However, the isolated use of NAC increased lipid peroxidation. SOD activity increased after BLM exposure only in the group treated with DFX and catalase activity not was altered in the presence of BLM. Data presented here indicates that the isolated use of NAC had limited effects on BLM-induced pulmonary oxidative stress in mice. The use of DFX improves the defense response and in association with NAC may be a good alternative in the treatment or prevention of diseases that have ROS and iron involved in their pathogenesis.",

Recent reports suggest that gossypol stimulates the generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in leukemia and colorectal carcinoma cells; however, gossypol-mediated cell death in leukemia cells was reported to be ROS-independent. This study was conducted to clarify the effect of ApoG2-induced ROS on mitochondria and cell viability, and to further evaluate its utility as a treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We tested the photocytotoxicity of ApoG2 to the poorly differentiated NPC cell line CNE-2 using the ROS-generating TL/10 illumination system. The rapid ApoG2-induced cell death was partially reversed by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), but the ApoG2-induced reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was not reversed by NAC. In the presence of TL/10 illumination, ApoG2 generated massive amounts of singlet oxygen and was more effective in inhibiting cell growth than in the absence of illumination. We also determined the influence of light on the anti-proliferative activity of ApoG2 using a CNE-2-xenograft mouse model. ApoG2 under TL/10 illumination healed tumor wounds and suppressed tumor growth more effectively than ApoG2 treatment alone. These results indicate that the ApoG2-induced CNE-2 cell death is partly ROS-dependent. ApoG2 may be used with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to treat NPC.",

Although the mechanism underlying the correlation between PM2.5 exposure and adverse effects has not fully elucidated, PM2.5-induced oxidative stress has been considered as an important molecular mechanism of PM2.5-mediated toxicity. In this work, human lung epithelial A549 cells were used to further investigate the biological effects of PM2.5 on autophagy. The cell viability showed both time- and concentration-dependent decrease when exposure to PM2.5, which can be attributed to increase of the levels of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in A549 cells. Moreover, PM2.5-induced oxidative damage in A549 cells was observed through the alteration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities compared to the unexposed control cells. PM2.5-induced autophagy was indicated by an increase in microtubule-associated protein light chain-3 (LC3) puncta, and accumulation of LC3 in both time- and concentration-dependent manner. PM2.5-induced mRNA expression of autophagy-related protein Atg5 and Beclin1 was also observed compared with those of the unexposed control cells. These results suggest the possibility that PM2.5-induced oxidative stress probably plays a key role in autophagy in A549 cells, which may contribute to PM2.5-induced impairment of pulmonary function.",

Our previous study demonstrated that the kidney form of glutaminase (GLS1) is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and can be used as a target for effective anticancer therapy. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels leading to cytotoxicity in cancer cells. However, the heterogeneity of cancer cells often leads to differing responses to oxidative lesions. For instance, cancer cells with high ratio of GSH/GSSG, a critical ROS scavenger, are resistant to ROS-induced cytotoxicity. We postulate that a combinatorial strategy firstly disrupting redox homeostasis followed by DHA might yield a profound antitumor efficacy. In this study, when HCC cells were treated with a GLS1 inhibitor 968, the ROS elimination capacity was significantly reduced in HCC cells, which rendered HCC cells but not normal endothelial cells more sensitive to DHA-mediated cytotoxicity. We further confirmed that this synergistic antitumor efficacy was mediated by excessive ROS generation in HCC cells. NAC, a ROS inhibitor, partly rescued the combinatorial cytotoxic effect of 968 and DHA. Given that GLS1 is a potential antitumor target and DHA has been safely used in clinic, our findings provide new insight into liver cancer therapy targeting glutamine metabolism combined with the ROS generator DHA, which can be readily translated into cancer clinical trials.",

Continuous administration of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a ROS inhibitor, before or after NNK treatment significantly blocked tumor development, although less effectively when BHA is administered after NNK treatment. Strikingly, BHA abolished the occurrence of F4/80+ macrophages with similar efficiency no matter whether it was administered before or after NNK treatment. Detection of cells from bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) confirmed that BHA markedly inhibited the accumulation of macrophages while slightly reducing the number of lymphocytes that were induced by NNK. Immunohistological staining showed that BHA specifically abolished the occurrence of CD206+ TAMs when it was administered before or after NNK treatment. Western blot analysis of TAMs markers, arginase I and Ym-1, showed that BHA blocked NNK-induced TAMs accumulation.

Geminin was sufficient to prevent the occurrence of multiple replications via interaction with Cdt1 after MTX treatment, and DHFR amplification proceeded in v-K-ras transfectants that possess a functional p53 in the absence of geminin.

The occurrence of hypermutable P. aeruginosa isolates was investigated directly in the sputum of 79 CF patients and among 141 isolates collected from 11 CF patients (10 to 15 isolates/patient) collected from the 1st and up to the 25th year of their chronic lung infection. The level of oxidized guanine moiety 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which is a frequently investigated DNA oxidative lesion, was measured. Hypermutable P. aeruginosa isolates were found in the sputum bacterial population of 54.4% of the CF patients. The earliest mutator P. aeruginosa isolates were found after 5 years from the onset of the chronic lung infection, and once they were present in the CF lung, the prevalence increased with time. The hypermutable isolates were significantly more resistant to antipseudomonal antibiotics than nonhypermutable isolates (P<or=0.001).

According to previous reports, chrysophanic acid-induced cell death shares features of necrotic cell death. However, the molecular and cellular processes underlying chrysophanic acid-induced cell death remain poorly understood.;Chrysophanic acid-induced cell death was monitored by cell viability assay and Annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) staining of renal cell carcinoma Caki-2 cells. The induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by chrysophanic acid and the suppression of ROS by anti-oxidants were evaluated by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate staining. The expression and phosphorylation of proteins that are involved in apoptosis and necroptosis were detected by immunoblotting.;The extent of chrysophanic acid-induced cell death was concentration and time dependent, and dead cells mainly appeared in the PI-positive population, which is a major feature of necrosis, upon fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Chrysophanic acid-induced cell death was associated with the generation of intracellular ROS, and this effect was reversed by pretreatment with N-acetyl cysteine. Chrysophanic acid-induced cell death was not associated with changes in apoptotic or necroptotic marker proteins.;The cell death induced by chrysophanic acid resembled neither apoptotic nor necroptotic cell death in human renal cell carcinoma Caki-2 cells.",

However the undesirable biological consequence, especially upon inhalation of the particle, requires further investigations. This study aimed to elucidate the nano-biointeractions of PEGylated reduced graphene oxide (PrGO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with that of lung alveolar epithelial cells (A549). Both nanomaterials showed dose dependent decrease in cell viability and alteration of cell morphology after 24h. Upon intracellular uptake of PrGO, it elicited oxidative stress mediated apoptosis in the cells by inducing ROS, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and inflammatory response by NF-κB activation. Conversely, rGO was found to scavenge ROS efficiently except at high dose after 24h. It was found that ROS at high dose of rGO prompted loss of MMP. rGO was found to adhere to the cell membrane, where it is assumed to bind to cell surface Toll like receptors (TLRs) thereby activating NF-κB mediated inflammatory response. All these events culminated in an increase in apoptosis of A549 cells after 24h of rGO exposure. It was also noticed that both the nanomaterials did not initiate lysosomal pathway but instead activated mitochondria mediated apoptosis. This study highlights the possible adverse toxic effect of PrGO and rGO upon inhalation and persistence of these particles in the lungs. Further research is required to comprehend the biological response of PrGO and rGO so as to advance its biomedical application and safety. ",

Treatments designed to increase intracellular cGMP attenuate ROS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis in several cell types, but the mechanisms are not understood, and the effect of cGMP on pulmonary endothelial cell death remains controversial. In the current study, increasing intracellular cGMP by either 8pCPT-cGMP (50 microM) or atrial natriuretic peptide (10 nM) significantly attenuated cell death in H(2)O(2)-challenged mouse lung microvascular (MLMVEC) monolayers. 8pCPT-cGMP also decreased perfusate LDH release in isolated mouse lungs exposed to H(2)O(2) or ischemia-reperfusion. The protective effect of increasing cGMP in MLMVECs was accompanied by enhanced endothelial H(2)O(2) scavenging (measured by H(2)O(2) electrode) and decreased intracellular ROS concentration (measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin fluorescence) as well as decreased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Akt. The cGMP-mediated cytoprotection and increased H(2)O(2) scavenging required >2 h of 8pCPT-cGMP incubation in wild-type MLMVEC and were absent in MLMVEC from protein kinase G (PKG(I))-/- mice suggesting a PKG(I)-mediated effect on gene regulation. Catalase and glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx-1) protein were increased by cGMP in wild-type but not PKG(I)-/- MLMVEC monolayers. Both the cGMP-mediated increases in antioxidant proteins and H(2)O(2) scavenging were prevented by inhibition of translation with cycloheximide. 8pCPT-cGMP had minimal effects on catalase and Gpx-1 mRNA. We conclude that cGMP, through PKG(I), attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity in MLMVEC by increasing catalase and Gpx-1 expression through an unknown posttranscriptional effect.",

The involvement of inflammatory mediators in ARDS has been the subject of intense investigation, and oxidant-mediated tissue injury is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of ARDS. In response to various inflammatory stimuli, lung endothelial cells, alveolar cells, and airway epithelial cells, as well as alveolar macrophages, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). In addition, the therapeutic administration of oxygen can enhance the production of these toxic species. As the antioxidant defense system, various enzymes and low-molecular weight scavengers are present in the lung tissue and epithelial lining fluid. In addition to their contribution to tissue damage, ROS and RNS serve as signaling molecules for the evolution and perpetuation of the inflammatory process, which involves genetic regulation. The pattern of gene expression mediated by oxidant-sensitive transcription factors is a crucial component of the machinery that determines cellular responses to oxidative stress. This review summarizes the recent progress concerning how redox status can be modulated and how it regulates gene transcription during the development of ARDS, as well as the therapeutic implications.",

Studies to date have largely focused on silica-induced production of ROS by lung phagocytes. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that particulate silica (DQ12) can also induce elevations in intracellular ROS in a cancer-target cell type, i.e., human bronchial epithelial cells (BECs), via an indirect mechanism that involves ROS-inducing extracellular factor(s) that occur upon the interaction of silica with culture medium. The intracellular production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in BECs was assessed by flow cytometry via monitoring dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence. Culture medium containing 10% human serum was incubated with silica particles in concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 microg/ml, and following incubation for 1 h and removal of the particles, the resulting supernatants were added to BECs. Silica-treated medium induced significant increases in intracellular H(2)O(2) after the medium had been treated with as little as 10 microg/ml of the particles. Further, the level of ROS increases in BECs in response to silica-treated medium was found to be virtually identical to that induced in cells that were directly treated with silica in suspension. Based on enzyme inhibitory studies, the mechanism for this increased generation of intracellular ROS appears to involve both mitochondrial respiration and a NAD(P)H oxidase-like system. Spectrofluorimetric experiments with the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase showed that superoxide anions (O2*-) and H(2)O(2) are generated in silica-treated medium, but these ROS do not fully account for the induction of the intracellular ROS response. Iron, on the other hand, was found to be crucial to the process. Our collective results suggest silica-aqueous medium interactions can lead to the generation of factor(s) that induce the intracellular production of potentially DNA-damaging ROS in BECs in a manner that does not require direct particle-cell interactions.",

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an autocrine and paracrine acting cytokine/growth factor that promotes lung adenocarcinoma cell motility, anchorage-independence and neo-angiogenic potential. Several recent studies indicate that the only known homolog of MIF, D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT - also referred to as MIF-2), has functionally redundant activities with MIF and cooperatively promotes MIF-dependent pro-tumorigenic phenotypes. We now report that MIF and D-DT synergistically inhibit steady state p53 phosphorylation, stabilization and transcriptional activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. The combined loss of MIF and D-DT by siRNA leads to dramatically reduced cell cycle progression, anchorage independence, focus formation and increased programmed cell death when compared to individual loss of MIF or D-DT. Importantly, p53 mutant and p53 null lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were only nominally rescued from the cell growth effects of MIF/D-DT combined deficiency suggesting only a minor role for p53 in these transformed cell growth phenotypes. Finally, increased p53 activation was found to be independent of aberrantly activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that occurs in response to MIF/D-DT-deficiency but is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) that mediate aberrant AMPK activation in these cells. Combined, these findings suggest that both p53 wildtype and mutant human lung adenocarcinoma tumors rely on MIF family members for maximal cell growth and survival. ",

ARG2 silencing changed tumor properties of thyroid cancer cells promoting apoptosis and reduced expression of cell proliferation markers. These results, coupled with enhanced nitric oxide production and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, account for the altered intracellular redox environment.

Additionally, a positive correlation of ARG2 with eNOS and related genes was investigated in thyroid tumors, further substantiating our in vitro findings. Our results suggest that ARG2 and eNOS may work in a coordinated manner and the underlying mechanism might be of major significance for thyroid tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression pathways.

Inhibition of ROS generation by ROS scavengers or by overexpression of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase effectively inhibited LA-induced apoptosis, indicating the role of ROS, especially hydroperoxide and superoxide anion, in the apoptotic process. Apoptosis induced by LA was found to be mediated through the mitochondrial death pathway, which requires caspase-9 activation. Inhibition of caspase activity by the pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-FMK) or caspase-9-specific inhibitor (z-LEHD-FMK) completely inhibited the apoptotic effect of LA. Likewise, the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor rotenone potently inhibited the apoptotic and ROS-inducing effects of LA, supporting the role of mitochondrial ROS in LA-induced cell death. LA induced down-regulation of mitochondrial Bcl-2 protein through peroxide-dependent proteasomal degradation, and overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein prevented the apoptotic effect of LA.

To identify miRNAs involved in redox regulation relevant for IPF, we performed arrays in human lung fibroblasts exposed to ROS. miR-9-5p was selected as the best candidate and we demonstrate its inhibitory effect on TGF-β receptor type II (TGFBR2) and NOX4 expression. Increased expression of miR-9-5p abrogates TGF-β1-dependent myofibroblast phenotypic transformation. In the mouse model of bleomycin-induced LF, miR-9-5p dramatically reduces fibrogenesis and inhibition of miR-9-5p and prevents its anti-fibrotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

Animal models may help in understanding the molecular processes involved in this condition and define therapeutic targets. Our goal was to identify molecular pathways using the earlier described preterm rabbit model of hyperoxia induced lung-injury. Transcriptome analysis by mRNA-sequencing was performed on lungs from preterm rabbit pups born at day 28 of gestation (term: 31 days) and kept in hyperoxia (95% O2) for 7 days. Controls were preterm pups kept in normoxia. Transcriptomic data were analyzed using Array Studio and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), in order to identify the central molecules responsible for the observed transcriptional changes. We detected 2217 significantly dysregulated transcripts following hyperoxia, of which 90% could be identified. Major pathophysiological dysregulations were found in inflammation, lung development, vascular development and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. To conclude, amongst the many dysregulated transcripts, major changes were found in the inflammatory, oxidative stress and lung developmental pathways. This information may be used for the generation of new treatment hypotheses for hyperoxia-induced lung injury and BPD. ",

Previous studies have shown decreased glutathione levels, linked to increased apoptosis, in lung homogenates and isolated Clara cells 3 h following styrene or styrene oxide (SO) administration or in vitro exposure. The objective of the current studies was to determine what effects styrene and its active metabolites, primarily styrene oxide, had on indicators of oxidative stress and attendant apoptosis in order to understand better the mechanism of styrene-induced toxicity. Three hours following in vitro exposure of Clara cells to styrene or SO there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Following administration of styrene or styrene oxide ip, increases in ROS, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation were observed. Since increases in ROS have been linked to increases in apoptosis ratios of bax/bcl-2, mRNA and protein expression were determined 3-240 h following the administration of styrene and R-styrene oxide (RSO). The bax/bcl-2 mRNA ratio increased 12 and 24 h following R-SO and 120 h following styrene administration. However, the bax/bcl-2 protein ratio was not increased until 240 h following R-SO, and 24 and 240 h following styrene administration. However, only a slight increase in caspase 3 was observed. These results indicated that oxidative stress occurred 3h following styrene or styrene oxide as evidenced by increased ROS and SOD. This increased ROS may be responsible for the increased 8-OHdG formation. Our findings of limited apoptosis in Clara cells following acute exposure to styrene or SO are in agreement with others and may reflect the minimal extent to which apoptosis plays a role in acute styrene toxicity. It is clear, however, that oxidative stress and oxidative effects on DNA are increased following exposure to styrene or styrene oxide, and these may play a role in the lung tumorigenesis in mice.",

However, little is known about how ICAM-1 is up-regulated in human airway epithelial cells. In this study, we show that tumor TNF-alpha induces monocyte adhesion to A549 human lung airway epithelium and also up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression. These effects were significantly diminished by pre-treatment with diphenyliodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase-like flavoenzyme. In addition, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased in response to TNF-alpha in A549 cells, suggesting a potential role of ROS in the TNF-alpha-induced signaling to ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion to airway epithelium. Further, we found out that expression of RacN17, a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, suppressed TNF-alpha-induced ROS generation, ICAM-1 expression, and monocyte adhesion to airway epithelium. These findings suggest that Rac1 lies upstream of ROS generation in the TNF-alpha-induced signaling to ICAM-1 expression in airway epithelium. Finally, pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, reduced TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 expression and both DPI and RacN17 significantly diminished NF-kappaB activation in response to TNF-alpha. Together, we propose that Rac1-ROS-linked cascade mediate TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 up-regulation in the airway epithelium via NF-kappaB-dependent manner.",

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with the CYP1A inducer beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF) (80 mg/kg/day), once daily for 4 days, followed by exposure to hyperoxic environment (O2 > 95%) or room air (normoxia) for 60 h. Pleural effusions were measured as estimates of lung injury. Activities of hepatic and pulmonary CYP1A1 were determined by measurement of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) activity. Northern hybridization and Western blot analysis of lung and liver were performed to assess mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Our results showed that beta-NF-treated animals, which displayed the highest pulmonary and hepatic induction in EROD activity (10-fold and 8-fold increase over corn oil (CO) controls, respectively), offered the most protective effect against hyperoxic lung injury, p < 0.05.

Several mechanisms may lead to oxidative stress in tumor-bearing patients, among others chronic inflammation. Inflammatory cells, especially macrophages and neutrophil leukocytes, may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which participate in carcinogenesis and tumor-associated immunosuppression. The aim of the study presented in this paper was to compare the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)--superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)--by neutrophils isolated from the blood of 16 patients with larynx carcinoma and 15 healthy controls. The serum activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase as well as the total peroxidase activity in serum have also been estimated. The production of ROS, especially spontaneous and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced O2-, was relatively higher in the patients with larynx carcinoma than in the healthy controls and increased parallel with the tumor stage (tumor, node, metastasis-TNM staging). The serum activity of catalase and peroxidase was also highest in the patients with stage T3 and T4 larynx carcinoma. After partial or total laryngectomy, a significant decrease in ROS production and the serum activity of catalase and peroxidase was observed. In contrast, the serum level of superoxide dismutase, which had been low prior to surgery, especially in the patients with advanced tumor stages (T3-T4), increased significantly afterwards. The results indicate the existence of oxidative stress in the blood of patients with larynx carcinoma and its significant decrease after partial or total laryngectomy.",

In genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for Kras-driven lung cancer, autophagy prevents the accumulation of defective mitochondria and promotes malignancy. Autophagy-deficient tumor-derived cell lines are respiration-impaired and starvation-sensitive. However, to what extent their sensitivity to starvation arises from defective mitochondria or an impaired supply of metabolic substrates remains unclear. Here, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of wild-type or autophagy-deficient (Atg7(-/-)) Kras-driven lung tumors. Although Atg7 deletion resulted in increased mitochondrial mutations, there were too few nonsynonymous mutations to cause generalized mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, pulse-chase studies with isotope-labeled nutrients revealed impaired mitochondrial substrate supply during starvation of the autophagy-deficient cells. This was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower energy charge, and a dramatic drop in total nucleotide pools. While starvation survival of the autophagy-deficient cells was not rescued by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, it was fully rescued by glutamine or glutamate (both amino acids that feed the TCA cycle and nucleotide synthesis) or nucleosides. Thus, maintenance of nucleotide pools is a critical challenge for starving Kras-driven tumor cells. By providing bioenergetic and biosynthetic substrates, autophagy supports nucleotide pools and thereby starvation survival. ",

We have confirmed this observation by interrogating four separate in vivo models that use complementary methodology including the use of p47(phox-/-) mice, p47(phox-/-) bone marrow chimera mice, adoptive transfer of macrophages from p47(phox-/-) mice, and an isolated perfused lung edema model that all point to a relationship between excessive acute inflammation and p47(phox) deficiency in macrophages.

Dysfunction of mitochondria and the role of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species produced by mitochondria have already been proposed in the pathogenesis of sepsis; however, the exact molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Oxidative stress induces cyclophilin D (CypD)-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), leading to organ failure in sepsis. In previous studies mPT was inhibited by cyclosporine A which, beside CypD, inhibits cyclophilin A, B, C and calcineurin, regulating cell death and inflammatory pathways. The immunomodulatory side effects of cyclosporine A make it unfavorable in inflammatory model systems. To avoid these uncertainties in the molecular mechanism, we studied endotoxemia-induced ALI in CypD(-/-) mice providing unambiguous data for the pathological role of CypD-dependent mPT in ALI. Our key finding is that the loss of this essential protein improves survival rate and it can intensely ameliorate endotoxin-induced lung injury through attenuated proinflammatory cytokine release, down-regulation of redox sensitive cellular pathways such as MAPKs, Akt, and NF-κB and reducing the production of ROS. Functional inhibition of NF-κB was confirmed by decreased expression of NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory genes. We demonstrated that impaired mPT due to the lack of CypD reduces the severity of endotoxemia-induced lung injury suggesting that CypD specific inhibitors might have a great therapeutic potential in sepsis-induced organ failure.

The contribution of phagocyte-derived ROS to inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage responses was investigated in the lungs of C57BL/6J wild-type and p47(phox-/-) mice, 24h after pharyngeal aspiration of DQ12 quartz (100 mg/kg bw). Bone-marrow-derived neutrophils from wild-type and p47(phox-/-) mice were used for parallel in vitro investigations in coculture with A549 human alveolar epithelial cells. Quartz induced a marked neutrophil influx in both wild-type and p47(phox-/-) mouse lungs. Significant increases in mRNA expression of the oxidative stress markers HO-1 and γ-GCS were observed only in quartz-treated wild-type animals. Oxidative DNA damage in lung tissue was not affected by quartz exposure and did not differ between p47(phox-/-) and WT mice. Differences in mRNA expression of the DNA repair genes OGG1, APE-1, DNA Polβ, and XRCC1 were also absent. Quartz treatment of cocultures containing wild-type neutrophils, but not p47(phox-/-) neutrophils, caused increased oxidative DNA damage in epithelial cells. Our study demonstrates that neutrophil-derived ROS significantly contribute to pulmonary oxidative stress responses after acute quartz exposure, yet their role in the associated induction of oxidative DNA damage could be shown only in vitro.",

In this study, we found that CAFs could induce prostate cancer cell EMT and invasion through a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway, which exploits reactive oxygen species (ROS) to drive a migratory and aggressive phenotype of prostate carcinoma cells. Moreover, CAFs was able to increase CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor expression in prostate cancer cells.

However, conflicting studies suggest that the importance of particle-derived formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) requires further examination. The present study focuses on whether oxidative stress in the form of H(2)O(2)-exposure may mimic the effects of quartz particles on chemokine responses in epithelial lung cells. The results show that H(2)O(2) and quartz exposure induced almost identical levels of CXCL8 (interleukin-8) release in the alveolar epithelial cell line A549, but in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, H(2)O(2)-exposure did not affect CXCL8 release significantly, whereas quartz induced a 16-fold increase. Among 17 different cytokine and chemokine genes H(2)O(2) induced up-regulation of only IL-5 in BEAS-2B cells, while quartz increased the expression of 8 different cytokines and chemokines. In A549 cells, however, there was a moderate but significant correlation between the cytokine/chemokine gene-expression profiles induced by the two agents. Thus, the response to oxidative stress may vary considerably between different lung cell lines.

ROFA was collected from a precipitator at Boston Edison Co., Everett, MA, USA. ROFA (ROFA-total) was suspended in saline, incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C, centrifuged, and separated into its soluble (ROFA-sol.) and insoluble (ROFA-insol.) fractions. Sprague-Dawley rats were intratracheally instilled with saline or ROFA-total or ROFA-sol. or ROFA-insol. (1 mg/100 g body wt.). Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage cells were harvested at 4, 24, and 72 h after instillation. Chemiluminescence (CL) of recovered cells was measured as an index of ROS production, and tissue-lipid-peroxidation was assessed to determine oxidative injury. Significant amounts of Al, Fe, and Ni were present in ROFA-sol., whereas ROFA-insol. contained Fe, V, and Al. Using electron spin resonance (ESR), significantly more hydroxyl radicals were measured in ROFA-sol. as compared to ROFA-insol. None of the ROFA samples had an effect on CL or lipid peroxidation at 4 h. Treatment with ROFA-total and ROFA-insol. caused significant increases in both CL (at 24 h) and lipid peroxidation (at 24 and 72 h) when compared to saline control value. ROFA-sol. significantly reduced CL production at 72 h after treatment and had no effect on lipid peroxidation at any time point. In summary, ROFA, particularly its soluble fraction, generated a metal-dependent hydroxyl radical as measured by a cell-free ESR assay. However, cellular oxidant production and tissue injury were observed mostly with the ROFA-total and ROFA-insol. particulate forms. ROS generated by ROFA-sol. as measured by ESR appear not to play a major role in the lung injury caused after ROFA exposure.",

We recently demonstrated that ATO-induced apoptosis in Calu-6 lung cancer cells is correlated with glutathione (GSH) content. Here, the effects of ATO and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors on Calu-6 cells were investigated in relation to cell growth, cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and GSH levels. Treatment with ATO inhibited the growth of the Calu-6 cells at 72 hours. ATO induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; DeltaPsi(m)). While general nonspecific ROS decreased in the ATO-treated Calu-6 cells, the intracellular superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) level including mitochondrial O(2)(-) increased. ATO also induced GSH depletion in the Calu-6 cells. The treatment with MAP kinase kinase (MEK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 inhibitors intensified the cell growth inhibition, cell death, MMP (DeltaPsi(m)) loss, and GSH depletion in the ATO-treated Calu-6 cells. In addition, the JNK and p38 inhibitors significantly increased the ROS levels including O(2)(-) in the ATO-treated Calu-6 cells. In conclusion, all the MAPK inhibitors slightly intensify cell death in the ATO-treated Calu-6 cells and the changes of ROS and GSH brought about by ATO and/or MAPK inhibitor treatment partially influence cell growth and death in Calu-6 cells.",

Moreover, thymoquinone-mediated apoptosis caused downregulation of c-FLIP and Bcl-2, the master regulators of the anti-apoptotic mechanism. However, we did not find any changes in mRNA expression level of c-FLIP, therefore; this regulation of c-FLIP was a result of post-translation modification by thymoquinone. In contrast, expression of the Bcl-2 protein was observed at both transcriptional and translational level. However, we also observed that thymoquinone enhanced the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Caki cells, which resulted in reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cytochrome c release into cytoplasm.

Based on those findings, the potential of suppressive ODN to prevent acute murine silicosis was examined. In vitro studies indicate that suppressive ODN blunt silica-induced macrophage toxicity. This effect was associated with a reduction in ROS production and p47phox expression (a subunit of NADPH oxidase key to ROS generation). In vivo studies show that pretreatment with suppressive (but not control) ODN reduces silica-dependent pulmonary inflammation, as manifest by fewer infiltrating cells, less cytokine/chemokine production, and lower levels of ROS (p < 0.01 for all parameters).

Arsenic increased β-catenin expression level and its promoter activity. ROS played a major role in arsenic-induced β-catenin activation. Treatment of DLD1 cells by arsenic enhanced both transformation and tumorigenesis of these cells. The tumor volumes of arsenic treated group were much larger than those without arsenic treatment.

Cytotoxicity was assayed in terms of cell viability, DNA damage status, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage.

In addition, the toxic effects of OPFRs in Caco-2 cells were relatively severer than those in HepG2 and A549 cells, which might result from some possible mechanisms apart from oxidative stress pathway. In conclusion, TBP, TPP, TBEP and TCPP could induce cell toxicity in various cell lines at relatively high concentrations as evidenced by suppression of cell viability, overproduction of ROS, induction of DNA lesions and increase of LDH leakage.

Berberine induced dose- and time-dependent irreversible inhibition of cell growth and cellular DNA synthesis. This was also confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy which showed that berberine induced morphological changes in HSC-3 cells.

Flow cytometric studies of the cell cycle distribution showed that berberine induced mainly G0/G1-phase arrest. Flow cytometric examinations also showed that berberine induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ production, as well as the dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which were correlated with apoptosis. In conclusion, our data support that berberine initially induces an endoplasmic reticulum stress response based on ROS and Ca2+ production which is followed by dysfunctions of the mitochondria, resulting in apoptosis of these oral cancer HSC-3 cells.

We histochemically studied the level of HA in breast carcinoma cells and their stroma and compared it with the expression of NO(*) synthases (NOSs), major antioxidant enzymes, and nitrotyrosine. We also assessed whether the level of HA correlates with traditional prognostic factors of breast cancer and survival. Stromal HA level was moderate or high in all the samples studied (n=185), and 84% of the lesions showed HA-positive carcinoma cells. Intense stromal HA signal was associated with high neuronal NOS expression (p=0.009), whereas tumor-cell associated HA was inversely correlated with nitrotyrosine expression (p=0.027). Of the traditional prognostic factors, tumor cell-associated HA was correlated with poor differentiation (p=0.011), and high stromal HA levels were associated with aggressive features of the carcinomas such as large primary tumor (p=0.002), poor differentiation (p=0.019), and estrogen (p=0.012) and progesterone receptor negativity (p=0.009). High stromal HA level also significantly predicted poorer survival. The strong positive correlation between neuronal NOS and stromal HA could reflect NO(*)-stimulated synthesis of HA, an extracellular matrix alteration that favors breast cancer progression. Furthermore, it is suggested that, while acting as a scavenger of NO(*)-derived radicals, cell-associated HA undergoes partial fragmentation, release from receptors, and further degradation in lysosomes, and thus becomes undetectable in histological sections.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Rapid increase in multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) production for their industrial and biomedical applications has led to concerns over the effects of MWCNTs on human health and the environment. Both animal and in vitro studies have provided important findings about MWCNT-induced effects on the lung cells or tissues. In vitro studies have provided a considerable amount of fundamental information on MWCNT-induced effects on the specific lung cells. However, the cell culture systems used in those studies were limited by the absence of dynamic nature of lung tissues. We hypothesized that MWCNT-induced cellular responses such as proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress under dynamic cell growth environment may differ from those under static cell growth environment.;In this study, we used a dynamic cell growth condition to mimic mechanically dynamic environment of the lung and characterized interleukin 8 (IL-8), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), and cell proliferation for three days following exposure of MWCNTs at different concentrations (5, 10, and 20 μg/ml) to A549 cell monolayer under both static and dynamic cell growth conditions. Our results demonstrated the distinct differences in the levels of inflammatory response and oxidative stress between static and dynamic cell growth conditions.;In conclusion, the dynamic cell growth system used in this study provided important changes in cellular responses that were not found in the static cell growth system and were similar to animal studies. The dynamic cell growth system can be considered as a viable alternative to in vivo test system in combination with existing in vitro static cell growth systems to evaluate the effect of MWCNTs on cellular responses in the respiratory system.",

One body of evidence specific to irradiation leukemogenesis documents the role of irradiated murine stromal cells in the cell biologic changes associated with evolution of leukemia in cocultivated, nonirradiated stem cells. Stem cell phenotypic changes that have been documented include upregulation of cell surface c-fms, downregulation of growth requirement for obligatory growth factors, and the appearance of novel transcripts detected by differential display. A second body of evidence documents the potential role of stromal cells functioning as biologic tumor promoters through their release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and production of altered adhesion molecules or growth factors during the chronic response to chemical or physical carcinogens. These molecular biologic mechanisms, potentially operative in stromal cells, can block apoptosis and induce DNA strand breaks in closely associated self-renewing stem cells. In an in vivo model of irradiation effects on lung stromal cells, we have irradiated the lungs of control C57BL/6J mice or other mice with orthotopic Lewis lung tumors and shown that TGF-beta release is increased following irradiation. The TGF-beta increase by irradiation may specifically be inhibited by administering an inhalation plasmid liposome mixture containing a transgene for human manganese superoxide dismutase prior to irradiation. An appreciation of the role of stromal cells in leukemogenesis and carcinogenesis may also be very relevant to the design of new therapeutic strategies for treatment of cancer, particularly since current strategies focus on eradication of stem cell transformants and do not rigorously address the persistence of surviving stromal cells.",

Free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals (OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), are considered to be the final causative molecules in the pathogenesis of ALI. Hydrogen, a new antioxidant, can selectively reduce OH and ONOO(-). In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that hydrogen inhalation could ameliorate ALI induced by intra-tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5mg/kg body weight). Mice were randomized into three groups: sham group (physiological saline+2% hydrogen mixed gas), control group (LPS+normal air) and experiment group (LPS+2% hydrogen mixed gas). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed to determine the total protein concentrations and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lung tissues were assayed for oxidative stress variables, wet/dry (W/D) ratio, histological, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting examinations. Our experiments exhibited that hydrogen improved the survival rate of mice and induced a decrease in lung W/D ratio. In addition, hydrogen decreased malonaldehyde and nitrotyrosine content, inhibited myeloperoxidase and maintained superoxide dismutase activity in lung tissues and associated with a decrease in the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and total protein concentrations in the BALF. Hydrogen further attenuated histopathological alterations and mitigated lung cell apoptosis. Importantly, hydrogen inhibited the activation of P-JNK, and also reversed changes in Bax, Bcl-xl and caspase-3. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that hydrogen inhalation ameliorated LPS-induced ALI and it may be exerting its protective role by preventing the activation of ROS-JNK-caspase-3 pathway.",

UPF1 is a synthetic GSH analog that was shown to have 60 times the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) in comparison to GSH.

However, NAC (200 mg/kg) ip and GSH (600 mg/kg), administered orally prior to R-SO (300 mg/kg) ip, showed significant protection against liver toxicity as measured by SDH activity. Unexpectedly, a synthetic GSH analog, UPF1 (0.8 mg/kg), administered intravenously (iv) prior to R-SO, produced a synergistic effect with regard to liver and lung toxicity. Treatment with UPF1 (0.8 mg/kg) iv every other day for 1 wk for preconditioning prior to R-SO ip did not result in any protection against liver and lung toxicity, but rather enhanced the toxicity when administered prior R-SO.

The binding of 3H-TAM to the AEBS was determined after preincubation (30 min) of the cells with excess 17 beta-estradiol (2 mumol/L). Specific and saturable binding of 3H-TAM to the cells was observed. Displacement of the tracer from its binding site was dose dependent. Scatchard analysis revealed a dissociation constant (Kd) of 73 nmol/L, indicating a binding site with moderate affinity and capacity (72 pmol/10(6) cells). Using this assay we were also able to demonstrate the presence of an endogenous ligand for the AEBS in ethanol extracts of human serum. Cell growth and 3H-thymidine incorporation by the follicular thyroid carcinoma cells were inhibited when the cells were exposed to TAM (1.5 mumol/L). In conclusion, TAM is able to bind to a specific receptor on this follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line, and a natural circulating ligand present in ethanol extracts of human serum interferes with its binding.",

Apoptosis of SHEE85 was confirmed by means of DNA fragmentation stained by Hoechst 33342, Sub-G1 cells scored by flow cytometry and ultrastructure of cells by electron microscopy. To evaluate the level of ROS, the chemiluminescent method was used for measuring the production of superoxide anion (O(-)*2). Lipid peroxide (malondialdehyde, MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured respectively by the photometry method. In the cells treated with As2O3 at a concentration of 5.0 micromol/l for 2-24 h, the content of cellular O(-)*2 and MDA was increased, but SOD and GSH-Px were significantly lower in the process of apoptosis in SHEE85. As2O3 at concentration of 0.5 micromol/l did not cause cell apoptosis but promoted cell proliferation. These results suggest that As2O3 at a high dosage (5 micromol/l) causes cell apoptosis and at a low dosage (0.5 micromol/l) causes cell proliferation.

We found that the novel polysaccharide suppressed MKN45 cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and arrested the cells at G2/M phase. Furthermore, we observed that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p53, caspase-9 and -3 were induced in the polysaccharide-treated MKN45 cells. In addition, pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and SP600125, the inhibitor of ROS and JNK, induced MKN45 cell proliferation, prevented the cell apoptosis and released the cells from cycle arrest.

The kininase I inhibitor, DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropionic acid (MGTPA), has no effect on the BK-induced contraction. BK is more potent in contracting parenchymal lung strips than other contractile agents (histamine, carbachol and substance P), however the BK-induced maximal contraction is lower than those obtained with histamine and carbachol.

These findings stand in contrast to the earlier observations in the Ro subline of ZR-75-1 cells in which IL-6 induces cell-cell separation without detachment of the cells from the substratum, with the cells displaying pseudopodia, increased motility, and decreased proliferation. The IL-6-induced ZR-75-1-Tx cell detachment and rounding are reversible by incubation of the treated cells in IL-6-free medium for several days. The distinctive changes induced by IL-6 in ZR-75-1-Ro cells are similarly reversible. Either acidic fibroblast growth factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate can replace serum as a cofactor in IL-6-induced ZR-75-1-Tx cell detachment.

We investigated the effects of hypothermia on ROS-induced cell damage in human alveolar type II cells. A549 cells were exposed to H2O2 and cultured at different temperatures, namely, normthermia (37°C), mild hypothermia (34°C), or moderate hypothermia (32°C). Cell damage was measured using various assays. The biochemical studies demonstrated a significant increase in apoptosis and intracellular ROS at 32°C in uninjured A549 cells. After exposure to H2O2, a marked decrease in cell viability (<50%) was demonstrated, and this was significantly ameliorated upon culture at 32°C. Significantly intracellular damage was found to affect the 24-hour H2O2-exposed cells in 37°C (P < .05), including an increase in apoptosis and necrosis, intracellular ROS, caspase-3 activity, HMGB1 protein expression, and some alterations to the cell cycle. On hypothermic treatment, the 24-hour H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation was significantly suppressed in cells cultured at both 32°C and 34°C (P < .05 versus 37°C). The cell cycle changes in 24-hour H2O2-exposed cells were significantly diminished when the cells were cultured in 32°C (P < .05 versus 37°C). However, these intracellular alterations were not seen in 6-hour H2O2-exposed cells. We concluded that moderate hypothermia (32°C) of alveolar epithelial A549 cells seems to provide protection against H2O2-induced 24-hour oxidative stress by attenuating cell death and intracellular damage. However, moderate hypothermia might cause minor damage to uninjured cells, so the use of hypothermic treatment needs to be judiciously applied.",

The role of pulmonary intravascular leukocytes in fMLP-induced eicosanoid production in rat lungs was studied, as was the effect of a calcium antagonist (Ro 40-5967). ETX increased the levels of 6-keto PGF1 alpha, but not the levels of TXB2 or LTB4. A second challenge with fMLP in ETX-primed rats resulted in increased production of these three eicosanoids, and increased neutrophil accumulation, as assessed by myeloperoxidase assay. The calcium antagonist attenuated both the production of eicosanoids and the accumulation of neutrophils in the lung. The levels of both 6-keto PGF1 alpha and TXB2 correlated well with lung neutrophil accumulation. Leukocytes isolated from the pulmonary vasculature released TXB2 and LTB4 when stimulated with fMLP in vitro. The amount of these eicosanoids released from pulmonary intravascular leukocyte suspension was well correlated with neutrophil counts in a leukocyte suspension. These data indicate that fMLP-induced production of eicosanoids in the lung, especially production of TXB2, is mediated by pulmonary intravascular neutrophils, and that calcium antagonists can attenuate eicosanoid production by decreasing the accumulation of neutrophils in the lung.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The induction of apoptosis by the synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR) has been documented in vitro in various cancer types. A role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in apoptosis induced by 4HPR in some cancer cells has been demonstrated recently. We studied five different human head and neck and five lung cancer cell lines to determine whether the ROS play a general role in 4HPR-induced apoptosis. We found that 4HPR induced apoptosis in all of the cell lines; however, this effect was blocked by antioxidants in only 2 of the 10 cell lines. 4HPR induced a greater than 4-fold increase in the generation of intracellular ROS in these two cell lines compared with a much lower effect in other cell lines. Furthermore, these two cell lines were most sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by 4HPR. The level of the cellular antioxidant thiol and superoxide dismutase activity were relatively lower in cells, which responded to 4HPR with a high level of ROS generation. These results indicate that although ROS can mediate 4HPR-induced apoptosis in some cells, which may have a low endogenous cellular antioxidant levels, other mechanisms exist for 4HPR-induced apoptosis. One such mechanism may involve retinoic acid receptors (RARs) because an RAR antagonist was able to block partially 4HPR-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, 4HPR-induced apoptosis involves at least three different mechanisms, which are complex and can overlap in the same cell line: (a) one mechanism involving 4HPR-induced ROS; (b) one involving RARs; and (c) at least one that does not involve ROS or RARs and remains unclear.",

Autoradiographic study of renal ACE using 125I-Ro 31-8472 or 125I-351A showed the same distribution of radioligand binding across kidney sections and identical radioligand binding for purified lung and testis ACE by Western blot, confirming that the same protein bound both radioligands. Analysis of displacement of 125I-Ro 31-8472 binding from ACE by ACE inhibitors 351A and lisinopril yielded biphasic curves for pulmonary, renal, and plasma ACE and a monophasic curve for ACE from the testis. Analysis by LIGAND suggested two binding sites in ACE from plasma or somatic sources and one binding site in ACE of testicular origin, as predicted by molecular biology studies. Displacement of 125I-351A binding from lung and testis ACE by Ro 31-8472 and 351A was monophasic. LIGAND analysis revealed interaction with a single class of binding sites on lung and testis ACE, in agreement with previous studies using 125I-351A. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for the carboxyl-terminal (KdI) and amino-terminal (KdII) binding sites of purified ACE, using 125I-Ro 31-8472, were similar for Ro 31-8472 (lung kdI, 65 +/- 7 pM; KdII, 175 +/- 38 pM) but were clearly different for 351A (lung KdI, 19 +/- 2 pM; KdII, 2771 +/- 489 pM; p less than 0.01). Cell membrane-associated somatic ACE and plasma ACE, which is devoid of a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic anchor region, had similar absolute values and differences in 351A binding affinities at the two ACE binding sites. Kd in testis was 46 +/- 6 pM for Ro 31-8472 and 16 +/- 3 pM for 351A, corresponding to estimates at the carboxyl-terminal binding site of somatic ACE. The 65-200-fold reduction in 351A binding affinity at the amino binding site may limit the detection of two binding sites on somatic ACE by 125I-351A radioligand binding analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

In this study we investigated if the observed cytokine responses were associated with the soluble or insoluble components of the stone particles and if there was a relationship between the differential cytokine release and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Exposure of the human alveolar cell line A549 to the different particle leachates (pH 7.4 and 4.0) did not induce corresponding differential increases in the IL-8 release as observed with whole particles. Increase in ROS production, measured as dichlorofluorescein-fluorescence, was only demonstrated after exposure of A549 cells to the pH 4.0 extract from basalt. Furthermore, generation of ROS was found in neutrophils but not in A549 cells and primary macrophages after exposure to suspensions of the solid particles. However, no obvious differences in potency among the different particles were demonstrated. In summary, other mechanisms than particle-induced ROS formation seem to be responsible for the differential induction of IL-8.

Although the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is widely thought to be responsible for the cell death observed following exposure to hyperoxia, it is not clear whether they act upstream of activation of the cell death pathway or whether they are generated as a result of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase activation. We hypothesized that the generation of ROS was required for hyperoxia-induced cell death upstream of Bax activation. In primary rat alveolar epithelial cells, we found that exposure to hyperoxia resulted in the generation of ROS that was completely prevented by the administration of the combined superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic EUK-134 (Eukarion, Inc., Bedford, MA). Exposure to hyperoxia resulted in the activation of Bax at the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and cell death. The administration of EUK-134 prevented Bax activation, cytochrome c release, and cell death. In a mouse lung epithelial cell line (MLE-12), the overexpression of Bcl-XL protected cells against hyperoxia by preventing the activation of Bax at the mitochondrial membrane. We conclude that exposure to hyperoxia results in Bax activation at the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent cytochrome c release.

The results of MTT assay showed dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity in BGC-823 cells with lobaplatin. Flow cytometry (FCM) assay indicated that lobaplatin affected BGC-823 cells' survival by inducing apoptosis. Western blot analysis also demonstrated that the occurrence of its apoptosis was associated with activation of Cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, lobaplatin could also increase the reactive oxygen species (ROS) slightly and decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔYm) obviously, elucidating that lobaplatin may induce apoptosis via mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, lobaplatin markedly blocked BGC-823 cells migration and invasion, and the reduction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression were also observed in vitro.

However, the contribution of mitochondrial ROS to normal cell proliferation has not been well investigated thus far. A previous report showed that Romo1 was responsible for the high ROS levels in tumour cells. Here, we show that endogenous ROS generated by Romo1 are indispensable for cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase in normal WI-38 human lung fibroblasts. The ROS level in these cells was down-regulated by Romo1 knockdown, resulting in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This arrest was associated with an increase in the level of p27(Kip1). These results demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS generated by Romo1 expression is required for normal cell proliferation and it is suggested that Romo1 plays an important role in redox signalling during normal cell proliferation.",

While the oncoprotein Mucin-1 (MUC1) performs multiple roles in the development of diverse human tumors, whether MUC1 is involved in acquired chemoresistance has not been determined. Using an acquired chemoresistance lung cancer cell model, we show that MUC1 expression was substantially increased in cells with acquired apoptosis resistance (AR). Knockdown of MUC1 expression effectively increased the sensitivity of these cells to the apoptotic cytotoxicity of anticancer therapeutics, suggesting that MUC1 contributes to acquired chemoresistance. Decreased catalase expression and increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were found to be associated with MUC1 overexpression. Scavenging ROS with butylated hydroxyanisole or supplying exogenous catalase dramatically suppressed MUC1 expression through destabilizing MUC1 protein, suggesting that reduced catalase expression mediated ROS accumulation is accounted for MUC1 overexpression. Further, we found that increased miR-551b expression in the AR cells inhibited the expression of catalase and potentiated ROS accumulation and MUC1 expression. Finally, by manipulating MUC1 expression, we found that MUC1 promotes EGFR-mediated activation of the cell survival cascade involving Akt/c-FLIP/COX-2 in order to protect cancer cells from responding to anticancer agents. Thus, our results establish a pathway consisting of miR-551b/catalase/ROS that results in MUC1 overexpression, and intervention against this pathway could be exploited to overcome acquired chemoresistance.

Through genetic and biochemical approaches, progress in the characterization of ROS points to distinctive roles in the program of epithelial cell differentiation during the development of a variety of organs. Although substantial, these advances remain hampered by the absence of an identified ligand, making ROS one of the last two remaining orphan receptor tyrosine kinases. Recent studies on the oncogenic activation of ROS as a result of different chromosomal rearrangements found in brain and lung cancers have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ROS transforming activities. ROS and its oncogenic variants therefore constitute clinically relevant targets for cancer therapeutic intervention.

However, limited studies have evaluated the pulmonary toxicity of PHMB associated with inflammatory responses. The aim of this study was to elucidate the inflammatory responses and its mechanisms induced by PHMB in lung cells. A549 cells exposed to PHMB showed decreased viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. The cells showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and slight generation of ROS. PHMB triggered inflammatory cytokine secretion and NF-κB activation by modulating the degradation of IκB-α and the accumulation of nuclear p65. TNF-α plays important roles in IL-8 expression as well as NF-κB activation. Moreover, IL-8 production induced by PHMB was completely suppressed by a NF-κB inhibitor, but not by a ROS scavenger.

Efficiency improvement on radiotherapy is demanded to achieve cancer treatment. We focused on radiation-induced normal cell damage, and are concerned about inflammation reported to act as a main limiting factor in the radiotherapy. Psoralidin, a coumestan derivative isolated from the seed of Psoralea corylifolia, has been studied for anti-cancer and anti-bacterial properties. However, little is known regarding its effects on IR-induced pulmonary inflammation. The aim of this study is to investigate mechanisms of IR-induced inflammation and to examine therapeutic mechanisms of psoralidin in human normal lung fibroblasts and mice. Here, we demonstrated that IR-induced ROS activated cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway in HFL-1 and MRC-5 cells. Psoralidin inhibited the IR-induced COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production through regulation of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathway. Also, psoralidin blocked IR-induced LTB(4) production, and it was due to direct interaction of psoralidin and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) in 5-LOX pathway. IR-induced fibroblast migration was notably attenuated in the presence of psoralidin. Moreover, in vivo results from mouse lung indicate that psoralidin suppresses IR-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-6 and IL-1 α/β) and ICAM-1. Taken together, our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism of IR-induced pulmonary inflammation in human normal lung fibroblast and mice, and suggest that psoralidin may be useful as a potential lead compound for development of a better radiopreventive agent against radiation-induced normal tissue injury.",

This study investigated the anti-tumor activity of sinomenine hydrochloride (SH), a hydrochloride form of sinomenine, in human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that SH potently inhibited cell viability of a broad panel of breast cancer cell lines. Two representative breast cancer cell lines, namely ER(-)/PR(-) MDA-MB-231 and ER(+)/PR(+) MCF-7, were used for further investigation. The results showed that SH induced G1/S cell cycle arrest, caused apoptosis and induced ATM/Chk2- and ATR/Chk1-mediated DNA-damage response in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The anti-cancer effect of SH was regulated by increased expression levels of p-ERK, p-JNK and p-38 MAPK. Further studies showed that SH resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) almost blocked SH-induced DNA damage but only mitigated SH-induced MAPK expression changes, suggesting that both ROS-dependent and -independent pathways were involved in MAPK-mediated SH-induced breast cancer cell death.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagen and glycosaminoglycans, are known to be sensitive to oxidative fragmentation. Heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan, is highly abundant in the ECM and tightly binds EC-SOD. We investigated the protective role of EC-SOD by evaluating the interaction of EC-SOD with heparan sulfate in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that ROS-induced heparin and heparan sulfate fragments induced neutrophil chemotaxis across a modified Boyden chamber, which was inhibited by the presence of EC-SOD by scavenging oxygen radicals. Chemotaxis in response to oxidatively fragmented heparin was mediated by Toll-like receptor-4. In vivo, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from EC-SOD knockout mice at 1, 14, and 28 days after asbestos exposure showed increased heparan sulfate shedding from the lung parenchyma.

It is also associated with the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study the effects of NAC were examined in cultured human fibroblasts during prolonged exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB), ultraviolet A (UVA) and visible irradiation (280-700 nm), delivered by a 150 W xenon-arc lamp. The alkaline comet assay was used to assess the DNA damage in individual cells. It was found that incubating skin and lung fibroblasts at 37 degrees C for 1 h with an optimal 6 mM NAC supplement prior to light exposure, significantly reduced the level of DNA damage in both cell types, however, the skin fibroblasts were less sensitive to xenon-arc lamp irradiation than lung fibroblasts. NAC incubation resulted in an initial delay in DNA damage when the cells were irradiated. There was also a significant reduction in the overall levels of DNA damage observed with continued irradiation. NAC significantly reduced the DNA damage produced in lung fibroblasts depleted of normal GSH protection by the glutamylcysteinyl synthetase inhibitor, L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine. Although the specific mechanism of NAC protection has not yet been elucidated, these results support the hypothesis that NAC may protect the cells directly, by scavenging ROS induced by UVA and visible radiation, and indirectly by donating cysteine for GSH synthesis.",

We performed a biopsy of a resistant tumor and identified an acquired mutation leading to a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 2032 in the ROS1 kinase domain. Although this mutation does not lie at the gatekeeper residue, it confers resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through steric interference with drug binding.

This is the result of vesicant-induced modifications of proteins important in maintaining the integrity of the lung. Cytochrome P450s are the major enzymes in the lung mediating detoxification of sulfur mustard and its metabolites. NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase is a flavin-containing electron donor for cytochrome P450. The present studies demonstrate that the sulfur mustard analog, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), is a potent inhibitor of human recombinant cytochrome P450 reductase, as well as native cytochrome P450 reductase from liver microsomes of saline and beta-naphthoflavone-treated rats, and cytochrome P450 reductase from type II lung epithelial cells. Using rat liver microsomes from beta-naphthoflavone-treated rats, CEES was found to inhibit CYP 1A1 activity. This inhibition was overcome by microsomal cytochrome P450 reductase from saline-treated rats, which lack CYP 1A1 activity, demonstrating that the CEES inhibitory activity was selective for cytochrome P450 reductase. Cytochrome P450 reductase also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) via oxidation of NADPH. In contrast to its inhibitory effects on the reduction of cytochrome c and CYP1A1 activity, CEES was found to stimulate ROS formation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that sulfur mustard vesicants target cytochrome P450 reductase and that this effect may be an important mechanism mediating oxidative stress and lung injury.",

Recently, a large prospective case controlled clinical study of cardiac surgery patients demonstrated that despite implementation of male donors, a high incidence of TRALI still occurred and suggested a need for additional interventions in susceptible patient populations. To examine if intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be effective, a murine model of antibody-mediated acute lung injury that approximates human TRALI was examined. When BALB/c mice were injected with the anti-major histocompatibility complex class I antibody 34-1-2s, mild shock (reduced rectal temperature) and respiratory distress (dyspnea) were observed and pre-treatment of the mice with 2 g/kg IVIg completely prevented these symptoms. To determine IVIg's usefulness to affect severe lung damage, SCID mice, previously shown to be hypersensitive to 34-1-2s were used. SCID mice treated with 34-1-2s underwent severe shock, lung damage (increased wet/dry ratios) and 40% mortality within 2 hours. Treatment with 2 g/kg IVIg 18 hours before 34-1-2s administration completely protected the mice from all adverse events. Treatment with IVIg after symptoms began also reduced lung damage and mortality. While the prophylactic IVIg administration did not affect 34-1-2s-induced pulmonary neutrophil accumulation, bone marrow-derived neutrophils from the IVIg-treated mice displayed no spontaneous ROS production nor could they be stimulated in vitro with fMLP or 34-1-2s. These results suggest that IVIg prevents murine antibody-mediated acute lung injury at the level of neutrophil ROS production and thus, alleviating tissue damage.",

These events were associated with substantial up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes including c-myc, FADD, Bax and cleaved-caspase-3, -8, and -9, while down-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2. Besides, CPS-treatment activated P38 and JNK MAPK pathways, yet P38 and JNK inhibitors afforded protection against CPS-induced apoptosis by abolishing activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9.

Mechanisms involved in TGF-β-mediated EMT and cell motility are unclear. Recent studies showed that p53 affects TGF-β/SMAD3-mediated signalling, cell migration, and tumorigenesis. We previously demonstrated that Nox4, a Nox family NADPH oxidase, is a TGF-β/SMAD3-inducible source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) affecting cell migration and fibronectin expression, an EMT marker, in normal and metastatic breast epithelial cells. Our present study investigates the involvement of p53 in TGF-β-regulated Nox4 expression and cell migration.;We investigated the effect of wild-type p53 (WT-p53) and mutant p53 proteins on TGF-β-regulated Nox4 expression and cell migration. Nox4 mRNA and protein, ROS production, cell migration, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation were examined in three different cell models based on their p53 mutational status. H1299, a p53-null lung epithelial cell line, was used for heterologous expression of WT-p53 or mutant p53. In contrast, functional studies using siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous p53 were conducted in MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast epithelial cells that express p53-R280K and MCF-10A normal breast cells that have WT-p53.;We found that WT-p53 is a potent suppressor of TGF-β-induced Nox4, ROS production, and cell migration in p53-null lung epithelial (H1299) cells. In contrast, tumour-associated mutant p53 proteins (R175H or R280K) caused enhanced Nox4 expression and cell migration in both TGF-β-dependent and TGF-β-independent pathways. Moreover, knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 (R280K) in TGF-β-treated MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast epithelial cells resulted in decreased Nox4 protein and reduced phosphorylation of FAK, a key regulator of cell motility. Expression of WT-p53 or dominant-negative Nox4 decreased TGF-β-mediated FAK phosphorylation, whereas mutant p53 (R280K) increased phospho-FAK. Furthermore, knockdown of WT-p53 in MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells increased basal Nox4 expression, whereas p53-R280K could override endogenous WT-p53 repression of Nox4. Remarkably, immunofluorescence analysis revealed MCF-10A cells expressing p53-R280K mutant showed an upregulation of Nox4 in both confluent and migrating cells.;Collectively, our findings define novel opposing functions for WT-p53 and mutant p53 proteins in regulating Nox4-dependent signalling in TGF-β-mediated cell motility.",

It is envisioned that estrogen-induced ROS mediated signaling is a key congruent mechanism that drives the modulation of uncoupled proteins in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. The present study investigates that estrogens may increase mitochondrial ROS production by repressing uncoupling proteins, which offers a new perspective on the understanding of why thyroid cancer occurs three times more often in females than in males, and the occurrence decreases after menopause.",

These so-called bystander effects remain an area of interest as it may provide enhanced efficacy in killing carcinomas with minimal radiation. It is well known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are ubiquitous among most biological activities. However, the role of ROS in bystander effects has not been thoroughly elucidated. We hypothesized that gradient irradiation (GI) has enhanced therapeutic effects via the ROS-mediated bystander pathways as compared to uniform irradiation (UI). We evaluated ROS generation, viability, and apoptosis in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) exposed to UI (5 Gy) or GI (8-2 Gy) in radiation fields at 2, 24 and 48 h after IR. We found that extracellular ROS release induced by GI was higher than that by UI at both 24 h (p < 0.001) and 48 h (p < 0.001). More apoptosis and less viability were observed in GI when compared to UI at either 24 h or 48 h after irradiation. The mean effective doses (ED) of GI were ~130% (24 h) and ~48% (48 h) higher than that of UI, respectively. Our results suggest that GI is superior to UI regarding redox mechanisms, ED, and toxic dosage to surrounding tissues.",

H(2)O(2) < 1 mM did not affect transport, whereas 1 mM H(2)O(2) activated (22)Na uptake (+200%) but inhibited (86)Rb uptake (-30%). Also hyperoxia, aminotriazole plus menadione, and diethyldithiocarbamate inhibited (86)Rb uptake. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, diphenyleneiodonium, and tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl, used to reduce ROS, inhibited (86)Rb uptake, thus mimicking the hypoxic effects, whereas deferoxamine, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were ineffective. Also, hypoxic effects on ion transport were not prevented in the presence of H(2)O(2), diethyldithiocarbamate, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine.

For hematopoietic stem cells, low levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS(Low)) is known to help sustain stemness properties. In this report, we evaluated the hypothesis that ROS(Low) character conferred CIC properties in HNSCC. Sphere cultures define CIC in HNSCC cell populations (HN-CIC). We found that ROS(Low) cells in HN-CIC defined in this manner were more numerous than in parental HNSCC cells. Further, ROS(Low) cells frequently coexpressed CIC surface markers such as memGrp78 and Glut3. Exploiting flow cytometry to sort cells on the basis of their ROS level, we found that isolated ROS(Low) cells displayed relatively more CIC properties, including quiescence, chemoresistance, in vitro malignant properties, and tumorigenicity. Pharmacological depletion of ROS modulators in cisplatin-treated HN-CIC reduced CIC properties, enhancing cell differentiation and enhancing cisplatin-induced cell death. Overall, our work defined cell subpopulations in HNSCC on the basis of differential intracellular ROS levels, which associated with stemness and chemoresistance properties. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that strategies to promote intracellular ROS levels may heighten the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy used for HNSCC treatment.",

Cell viability was measured by the Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK8). Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry as well as cell cycle and reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis. Western blot analysis was used to detect the active form of caspase-3 as well as Bax and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) expressions after cells were treated with different concentrations of ponicidin. The results revealed that ponicidin could inhibit the growth of MKN28 cells significantly in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. The cell cycle was blocked and ROS generation was increased after the cells were treated with ponicidin. Bcl-2 expression was down-regulated remarkably while Bax expression and the active form of caspase-3 were increased after apoptosis occurred. We therefore conclude that ponicidin exhibited significant growth inhibition of gastric carcinoma cell line MKN28 and induced apoptosis of MKN28 cells via the signaling pathway regulated by Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3).

Therefore, our aim was to further explore the ability of sodium arsenite to induce MCF-7 epithelial breast cell proliferation and some of its underlying mechanisms by studying ROS production, c-Myc and HO-1 protein levels, 8-OHdG formation and NF-kappaB activation. Low arsenite concentrations (0.5-5 microM) induced ROS production and ROS-related depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane suggesting that mitochondria played an important role in the oxidative effects of As. ROS-mediated DNA damage as measured by the presence of 8-OHdG DNA-adducts in their nuclei, IkappaB phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation and increases in c-Myc and HO-1 protein levels were also observed, suggesting that these factors play a relevant role in the arsenite induced MCF-7 cell recruitment into the S-phase of the cell cycle and cell proliferation observed.

However, because both nuclear DNA and mtDNA control mitochondrial respiratory function, it is difficult to exclude the possible contribution of nuclear DNA mutations to mitochondrial respiration defects and the resultant expression of tumor phenotypes. Therefore, it is important to generate transmitochondrial cybrids sharing the same nuclear DNA background but carrying mtDNA with and without the mutations by using intercellular mtDNA transfer technology. Our previous studies isolated transmitochondrial cybrids and showed that specific mtDNA mutations enhanced tumor progression as a consequence of overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study assessed whether mtDNA mutations inducing ROS overproduction always enhance tumor progression. We introduced mtDNA from senescence-accelerated mice P1 (SAMP1) into C57BL/6J (B6) mice-derived Lewis lung carcinoma P29 cells, and isolated new transmitochondrial cybrids (P29mtSAMP1 cybrids) that overproduced ROS. The inoculation of the cybrids into B6 mice unexpectedly showed that mtDNA from SAMP1 mice conversely induced tumor suppression. Moreover, the tumor suppression of P29mtSAMP1 cybrids in B6 mice occurred as a consequence of innate immune responses of the host B6 mice. Enzyme pretreatment experiments of P29mtSAMP1 cybrids revealed that some peptides encoded by mtDNA and expressed on the cell surface of P29mtSAMP1 cybrids induce increased IL-6 production from innate immune cells (dendritic cells) of B6 mice, and mediate augmented inflammatory responses around the tumor-inoculated environment. These observations indicate presence of a novel role of mtDNA in tumor phenotype, and provide new insights into the fields of mitochondrial tumor biology and tumor immunology. ",

The involvement of DR5 in the mechanism whereby TIIA exerts its effects is unknown. This study aimed to explore the mechanism underlying TIIA augmentation of TRAIL-induced cell death in ovarian carcinoma cells. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to assess the mRNA and protein expression of relating signaling proteins. Transcriptional activation was explored by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. We found that TIIA sensitized human ovarian carcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced extrinsic apoptosis. Combined treatment with subtoxic concentrations of TIIA and TRAIL was more effective than single treatments with respect to cytotoxicity, clonogenic inhibition, and the induction of caspase-8 and PARP activity in ovarian carcinoma cell lines TOV-21G and SKOV3. TIIA induced DR5 protein and mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner. DR5/Fc treatment markedly suppressed the TRAIL cytotoxicity enhanced by TIIA. These results indicate that DR5 plays an essential role in TIIA-induced TRAIL sensitization and that induction of DR5 by TIIA is mediated through the up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Knockdown of CHOP gene expression by shRNA attenuated DR5 up-regulation and rescued cell viability under the treatment of TIIA-TRAIL combination. TIIA promoted JNK-mediated signaling to up-regulated CHOP and thereby inducing DR5 expression as shown by the ability of a JNK inhibitor to potently suppress the TIIA-mediated activation of CHOP and DR5. In addition, the quenching of ROS using NAC prevented the induction of JNK phosphorylation and CHOP induction. Furthermore, inhibition of ROS by NAC significantly attenuated TRAIL sensitization by TIIA. Taken together, these data suggest that TIIA enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulating DR5 receptors through the ROS-JNK-CHOP signaling axis in human ovarian carcinoma cells. ",

DDH belongs to a family of aldoketo reductases that are involved in the detoxification of several endogenous and exogenous substrates. DDH1 and DDH2 in particular have been shown to be involved in the detoxification (activation?) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Based on the involvement of DDH in the detoxification of electrophilic PAH intermediates, the effect of DDH on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line was investigated in the current study. In addition to the overexpression of DDH1 and DDH2, increased expression of DDH3 was demonstrated in the cisplatin-resistant 2008/C13* cells, compared to the parental 2008 cells. However, as assessed by RT-PCR, neither cell line expressed DDH4. The 2008/C13* cells were eightfold resistant to cisplatin, and transfection experiments utilizing cisplatin-sensitive 2008 cells suggest that this could be mediated by overexpression of either DDH1, DDH2, or DDH3. The 2008/C13* cells had lower basal intracellular ROS level as compared to the 2008 cells and ROS production was decreased in the recombinant 2008 cells with forced, constitutive overexpression of either, DDH1, DDH2, or DDH3. Transfection of siRNA against DDH1 or DDH2 in the cisplatin-resistant 2008/C13* cells not only significantly decreased their cisplatin-resistance index (as assayed by MTT and colony formation assay) but also led to an increase in the basal levels of ROS production (although transfection of siRNA against DDH3 resulted in cell death). The 2008/C13* cells were found to be cross-resistant to the cytotoxic effects of hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide and knockdown of either DDH1 or DDH2 expression (using siRNA) resulted in sensitization of the resistant cells to these agents. These results support the conclusion that the increased levels of DDH in the 2008/C13* cells are directly responsible for the reduced production of ROS and that this may play a role in the development of cisplatin resistance.",

Here we report that CS extract (CSE) increased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating AMPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and NF-κB, as well as inducing IL-8, in human macrophages. N-acetyl-cysteine (ROS scavenger) or hexamethonium [nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist] attenuated the CSE-induced increase in intracellular ROS, activation of AMPK and NF-κB, as well as IL-8 induction, which suggests that nAChRs and ROS are important. Prevention of AMPK activation by compound C or AMPK siRNA reduced CSE-induced IL-8 production, confirming the role of AMPK. Compound C or AMPK siRNA also inhibited the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB by CSE, which suggests that these molecules are downstream of AMPK. Additionally, exposure of human macrophages to nicotine activated AMPK and induced IL-8 and that these effects were lessened by hexamethonium or compound C, implying that nicotine in CS may be causative. Furthermore, chronic CS exposure in mice promoted AMPK phosphorylation and expression of MIP-2 (an IL-8 homolog) in infiltrated macrophages and in lung tissues, as well as induced lung inflammation, all of which were reduced by compound C treatment. Thus, we identified a novel nAChRs-dependent, ROS-sensitive, AMPK/MAPKs/NF-κB signaling pathway, which seems to be important to CS-induced macrophage IL-8 production and possibly to lung inflammation.",

However, the role of CXCL1 in mediating neutrophil leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production is unclear, as is the contribution of these factors to host immunity. In this study, we investigated 1) the role of CXCL1 in LTB(4), NADPH oxidase, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression in lungs and neutrophils, and 2) whether LTB(4) postinfection reverses innate immune defects in CXCL1(-/-) mice via regulation of NADPH oxidase and iNOS. Our results demonstrate reduced neutrophil influx, attenuated LTB(4) levels, and decreased ROS and iNOS production in the lungs of CXCL1(-/-) mice after Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Using neutrophil depletion and repletion, we found that neutrophils are the predominant source of pulmonary LTB(4) after infection. To treat immune defects in CXCL1(-/-) mice, we intrapulmonarily administered LTB(4). Postinfection, LTB(4) treatment reversed immune defects in CXCL1(-/-) mice and improved survival, neutrophil recruitment, cytokine/chemokine expression, NF-κB/MAPK activation, and ROS/RNS production. LTB(4) also enhanced myeloperoxidase, H(2)O(2,) RNS production, and bacterial killing in K. pneumoniae-infected CXCL1(-/-) neutrophils. These novel results uncover important roles for CXCL1 in generating ROS and RNS in neutrophils and in regulating host immunity against K. pneumoniae infection. Our findings suggest that LTB(4) could be used to correct defects in neutrophil recruitment and function in individuals lacking or expressing malfunctional CXCL1.",

AA reduced the recruitment of inflammatory cells and MCP-1 expression in lung tissue of CS exposure mice.

Furthermore, AA increased HO-1 expression and inhibited the reduced expression of SOD3 in lung tissue.

Suppression of AKR1C3 via RNAi or its chemical inhibitors restored the sensitivity of the acquired tumor cells and xenograft BALB/c nude mice to ionizing radiation (IR). Cellular monitoring of the oxidative stress in the AKR1C3-elevated cells indicated that IR-induced ROS accumulation and the concomitant DNA damage was significantly alleviated, and such protective consequence disappeared upon AKR1C3 knockdown. These findings uncover the potential involvement of AKR1C3 in removal of cellular ROS and explain, at least partially, the acquired radioresistance by AKR1C3 overexpression.

In order to identify various relevant factors affected by the E7 oncogene, we established a stable cell line, which constitutively expressed E7 using the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. The increased expression and activity of catalase in the E7-expressing HaCaT cells (HaCaT/E7) were verified via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight, Western blot, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses. The regulation of catalase by E7 was investigated by the detection of catalase promoter activity. E7 enhanced the activities of both the catalase promoter and nuclear factor-kappaB, one of the major transcription factors regulating the expression of the catalase gene. HaCaT/E7 cells produced lower quantities of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and appeared to be more resistant to H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. Moreover, in order to test the specific effects of E7 on catalase induction, the HaCaT/E7 cells were transiently transfected with E7 antisense vector, resulting in reductions in both the expression and activity of catalase, and a recovery of intracellular ROS levels, thus resulting in recovered sensitivity to H(2)O(2)-induced cell death.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of periodic-hyperoxia training on biological antioxidants (BAP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and free radicals (FR) production. Thirty adult male rats, matched with age and body weigh, were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group served as control (C) and the second (HP) was exposed to hyperoxia for 48. Animals in the third group (HP-T) were trained on hyperoxia for 1.5 h daily for three weeks. Following the exposure period for each group animals were sacrificed and lungs tissues were homogenized for BAP, LDH and FR determinations. LDH activity was determined by Randox protocol (Randox - UK). BAP and FR were determined using dROM method (H&D - Italy). Results showed that mean (±SD) BAP activity increased significantly (p < 0.05) from the baseline control of 7105.88 ± 2021.49 to 8611.20 ± 1245.26 (U/L) after hyperoxia training; then dropped to 6784.00 ± 1879.50 during hyperoxia exposure for 48 h.

Transiently increased gamma-GCSh expression using tetracycline-inducible gamma-GCSh adenoviral expression system also showed down-regulation of MMP3 and MMP10, but not MMP1.

We investigated oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by wood smoke extract (SE) in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) and delineated their relationship. We found that SE increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), depleted intracellular glutathione, and upregulated Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and heme oxygenase-1 (2 antioxidant enzymes), but it failed to alter the expression of catalase and glutathione peroxidase. In addition, SE promoted apoptosis as indicated by the external exposure of membrane phosphatidylserine, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase in the level of Bax (a proapoptotic protein), and enhanced DNA fragmentation. This apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial-to-nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG) (2 apoptogenic proteins) but was independent of caspase cascade activation. Whereas N-acetylcysteine (an antioxidant) effectively reversed the SE-induced increase in ROS and depletion of glutathione, it also suppressed SE-induced nuclear translocation of either AIF or EndoG and prevented the enhanced DNA fragmentation that would have resulted from this. We conclude that 1) although SE upregulates Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and heme oxygenase-1, it nevertheless increases intracellular oxidative stress in HPAECs, and 2) SE promotes oxidative stress-mediated caspase-independent HPAEC apoptosis that involves mitochondrial-to-nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG.

Chronic BHT exposure is accompanied by pulmonary inflammation and several studies indicate that elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in its promoting activity. The link between BHT and elevated ROS involves formation of quinone methide (QM) metabolites; these electrophiles form adducts with a variety of lung proteins including several enzymes that protect cells from oxidative stress. Studies in vitro demonstrated that QM alkylation of cytoprotective enzymes is accompanied by inactivation, so an objective of the present investigation was to determine if inactivation also occurs in vivo. Two groups of mice were exposed to BHT by intraperitoneal injection, one for 10 days and the other for 24 days, and proteins from lung cytosols were examined for damage. Analysis by Western blotting demonstrated that BHT treatment caused substantial increases in protein carbonylation, nitration and adduction by 4-hydroxynonenal, confirming the occurrence of sustained oxidative and nitrosative stress over the treatment period required for tumor promotion. Effects of BHT on the activities and/or levels of a representative group of antioxidant/protective enzymes in mouse lung also were assessed; NAD(P)H:quinone reductase and glutathione reductase were unaffected, however carbonyl reductase activity decreased 50-60%. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities increased 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit expression increased 32-39% relative to untreated mice. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity decreased 50-60% but concentrations of the predominant isoforms, GSTM1 and P1, were not affected. GSTP1 was substantially more susceptible than M1 to adduction and inhibition by treatment with BHT-QM in vitro, suggesting that lower GST activity in mice after BHT treatment is due to adduction of the P1 isoform. The results of this study provide additional insight into mechanisms of BHT-induced oxidative damage and further support a link between inflammation and tumor promotion in mouse lung.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The generation of reactive oxygen radicals in mammalian cells profoundly affects numerous critical cellular functions, and the absence of efficient cellular detoxification mechanisms which remove these radicals can result in several human diseases. Growing evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells act as second messengers in intracellular signaling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells. ROS are tumorigenic by virtue of their ability to increase cell proliferation, survival, cellular migration, and also by inducing DNA damage leading to genetic lesions that initiate tumorigenicity and sustain subsequent tumor progression. However, it is also known that ROS can induce cellular senescence and cell death and can therefore function as anti-tumorigenic agents. Therefore, the mechanisms by which cells respond to reactive oxygen species depends on the molecular background of cell and tissues, the location of ROS production and the concentration of individual ROS species. Carcinoma cells produce ROS at elevated rates in vitro, and in vivo many tumors appear persistent to oxidative stress. Thus, the finding that a diet rich in antioxidants or the elimination of ROS by antioxidant compounds prevents the development of certain cancers provided the setting for subsequent investigation of the tumorigenic actions of reactive oxygen species. This review outlines the current knowledge on the various roles of ROS in tumor development and progression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a distinctive, rarely metastasizing mesenchymal neoplasm composed of fascicles of spindle cells with a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. Roughly 50% of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harbor ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene rearrangements. Such tumors are usually positive for ALK by immunohistochemistry. The molecular pathogenesis of ALK-negative inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors is largely unknown. A recent study identified rearrangements of ROS1 (another tyrosine kinase receptor) in a subset of ALK-negative inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Immunohistochemistry for ROS1 has been shown to correlate with ROS1 rearrangement in lung adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether immunohistochemistry for ROS1 could predict ROS1 rearrangement in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. In total, 30 inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors were evaluated, including 21 ALK-positive tumors (10 confirmed to harbor ALK rearrangements, with TPM3, CLTC, RANPB2, and FN1 fusion partners) and 9 ALK-negative tumors (including 2 known to harbor ROS1 rearrangements). Immunohistochemistry was performed on whole tissue sections following pressure cooker antigen retrieval using a rabbit anti-ROS1 monoclonal antibody. The results were scored as 'positive' or 'negative,' and the pattern of staining was recorded. Three ALK-negative inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (including both tumors with known ROS1 rearrangements) showed immunoreactivity for ROS1, whereas all ALK-positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors were negative for ROS1. One ROS1-positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (with YWHAE-ROS1 fusion) showed strong, diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining; one case (with TFG-ROS1 fusion) showed weak, diffuse and dot-like cytoplasmic staining; and one case (fusion partner unknown) showed moderate, diffuse and dot-like cytoplasmic staining. Expression of ROS1 correlates with ROS1 gene rearrangement in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. These findings suggest that immunohistochemistry for ROS1 may be useful to support the diagnosis of a subset of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors and may select some clinically aggressive cases for targeted therapy directed against ROS1.

By comparing two subpopulations of the B16 mouse melanoma (B16-F0 and B16-F10) endowed with different lung metastasis capacities (low and high, respectively) we found that both the expression/phosphorylation of c-Met and the steady-state levels of ROS positively correlated with metastatic growth. shRNA-mediated downregulation of c-Met in F10 cells led to a parallel decrease in the generation of oxygen species and in metastatic capacity, suggesting that oxidants may mediate the pro-metastatic activity of the HGF receptor. c-Met activation by a ligand elicits the formation of oxidant species through the oxidase-coupled small GTPase Rac-1, a relevant downstream target of the HGF-R. Moreover, cell treatment with the catalytic ROS scavengers EUK-134 and EUK-189 attenuates Met signaling to ERKs and inhibits the anchorage-independent growth of F10 cells, consistent with a critical role for oxygen species in HGF signaling and in aggressive cell behavior. Finally, genetic manipulation of the Rac-ROS cascade at different levels demonstrated its crucial role in the pro-metastatic activity of c-Met in vivo. Thus, we have outlined a novel cascade triggered by c-Met and mediated by ROS, linked to metastasis and potentially targetable by new antimetastatic, redox-based therapies.",

Although ABT-737, as a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, has recently emerged as a novel cancer therapeutic reagent, apoptosis induced by ABT-737 is often blocked in several types of cancer cells. This study investigated whether the combination of the small-molecule BH3 mimetic ABT-737 and the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine was an effective strategy for treating renal cancer cells. We found that the combination of ABT-737 and chloroquine synergistically decreased cell viability when compared to treatment with either single reagent. Cell apoptosis induced by a combined treatment was markedly inhibited by the caspase inhibitors z-DEVD-FMK and z-VAD-FMK. It was also inhibited by cathepsin inhibitor E-64 and CTSI (cathepsin inhibitor), which suggested that apoptosis was dependent on the cascade of caspase activation and cathepsins released from lysosomes. Furthermore, we found that ABT-737 could increase the cell level of ROS, which triggers cathepsin-mediated cell death and augments the role of chloroquine in cell death. So the combination of ABT-737 and chloroquine was an effective strategy for the treatment of renal cancer cells, and this combined strategy may widen the therapeutic window of ABT-737 and chloroquine as well as enhance the clinical efficacy of synergistic drug combinations.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mustard gas exposure causes inflammatory lung diseases. Many inflammatory lung diseases are associated with oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the maintenance of physiological functions. In tissues, it is therefore essential to maintain a steady-state level of antioxidant activity to allow both for the physiological functions of ROS to proceed and at the same time preventing tissue damage. We have recently reported that mustard gas exposure decreases the overall activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In the present study, we investigated the effects of mustard gas on each of the three isozymes: SOD-1 (Cu/Zn), SOD-2 (Mn), and SOD-3 (extracellular). Adult guinea pigs were intratracheally injected single doses of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) (2 mg/kg body weight) in ethanol. Control animals were injected with vehicle in the same way. The animals were sacrificed after 7 days, and lungs were removed after perfusion with physiological saline. Lung injury was established by measuring the leakage of iodinated-BSA into lung tissue. Mustard gas exposure caused a significant increase in the activity of SOD-1 (35%). However, the SOD-3 activity which is the predominant type in lung was significantly decreased (62%), whereas no change was observed in SOD-2 activity. Thus the decrease in the total activity of SOD was primarily due to the SOD-3 isozyme. Northern blot analysis indicated 3.5-fold increased expression of SOD-1 in mustard gas exposed lung, but no significant change in the expression of SOD-2 and SOD-3 was observed. Mustard gas exposure did not cause mutation in the coding region of SOD-1 gene while causing modulation in expression levels. The protein levels of SOD-1, SOD-2, and SOD-3 were not altered significantly in the mustard gas exposed lung. Our results indicate that the overall decrease in the activity of SOD by mustard gas exposure is probably mediated by direct inactivation of the SOD-3 gene or the enzyme itself. This decrease in the activity of SOD-3 may be due to the cleavage of active form of the protein to an inactive form. The existence of active and inactive forms of SOD-3 as a result of shifts in Cys-Cys disulfide bonding has been described in human, recently. Studies are underway in our laboratory to investigate whether mustard gas induced inactivation of SOD-3 in lung is similarly mediated by a change in Cys-Cys disulfide bonding.",

Furthermore, capsaicin effectively inhibited cell proliferation, prevented invasiveness of K-ras-transformed pancreatic cancer cells, and caused minimum toxicity to parental E6E7 cells. In vivo, capsaicin exhibited antitumor activity against pancreatic cancer and showed oxidative damage to the xenograft tumor cells.;K-ras oncogenic signaling causes increased ROS stress through NOX, and abnormal ROS stress can selectively kill tumor cells by using NOX inhibitors.

In this study, we showed that GSK-3β inhibits ROS-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cell death by suppressing ASK1. We first found that ectopic expression of GSK-3β suppressed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in HepG2 cells and knockdown of endogenous GSK-3β expression exhibited opposite effects. Moreover, GSK-3β expression clearly inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of ASK1 in HepG2 cells, in association with a decrease in ASK1 protein level. Further exploration revealed that GSK-3β induced ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of ASK1 via inhibition of ubiquitin-specific protease USP9X. Our results thus suggest that GSK-3β is a key factor involved in ASK1 activation and ROS-induced cell death. ",

Inhibition of ER stress by CHOP knockdown or treatment with the ER stress inhibitors, salubrinal and 4-phenylbutyric acid, reduced LicA-induced cell death. LicA also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine reduced LicA-induced cell death and CHOP expression. In addition, LicA increased the levels of cytosolic Ca(2+), which was blocked by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (an antagonist of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor) and BAPTA-AM (an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator). 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and BAPTA-AM inhibited LicA-induced cell death. Interestingly, LicA induced phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) and inhibition of PLCγ1 reduced cell death and ER stress. Moreover, the multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sorafenib and sunitinib, reduced LicA-induced cell death, ER stress, and cytosolic Ca(2+) and ROS accumulation.

A previous study (Carpenter et al., 2011) has measured ROS level in human lung bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells and arsenic-transformed BEAS-2B cells and found that ROS levels were higher in transformed cells than that in parent normal cells. Based on these observations, the authors concluded that cell transformation induced by arsenic is mediated by increased cellular levels of ROS. This conclusion is problematic because this study only measured the basal ROS levels in transformed and parent cells and did not investigate the role of ROS in the process of arsenic-induced cell transformation. The levels of ROS in arsenic-transformed cells represent the result and not the cause of cell transformation. Thus question concerning whether ROS are important in arsenic-induced cell transformation remains to be answered. In the present study, we used expressions of catalase (antioxidant against H2O2) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2, antioxidant against O2(-)) to decrease ROS level and investigated their role in the process of arsenic-induced cell transformation. Our results show that inhibition of ROS by antioxidant enzymes decreased arsenic-induced cell transformation, demonstrating that ROS are important in this process. We have also shown that in arsenic-transformed cells, ROS generation was lower and levels of antioxidants are higher than those in parent cells, in a disagreement with the previous report. The present study has also shown that the arsenic-transformed cells acquired apoptosis resistance. The inhibition of catalase to increase ROS level restored apoptosis capability of arsenic-transformed BEAS-2B cells, further showing that ROS levels are low in these cells. The apoptosis resistance due to the low ROS levels may increase cells proliferation, providing a favorable environment for tumorigenesis of arsenic-transformed cells. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Isoprostanes are prostaglandin isomers produced from the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the cellular membrane. They have been used as a specific index of cellular lipoperoxidation and as an indirect measure of oxidative stress. However, these molecules also present several biological activities. An oxidative environment measured as the presence of other indirect measurements of reactive oxygen species lipoperoxidation has recently been described in basal cell carcinoma, the most frequent type of non-melanoma skin cancer. This study aims to measure the levels of 8-isoprostaglandin F2alpha, an isoprostane widely studied in other models as a by-product of ROS-induced lipid peroxidation, in basal cell carcinoma and in UVA irradiated healthy skin. We found that 8-iso-PGF2 alpha is present in higher levels in BCC specimens compared to healthy non sun-exposed skin, confirming previous studies on the production of lipoperoxidation in this tumor. Moreover, we demonstrated that topical pre-treatment with a compound containing vitamin E is capable of reducing 8-iso-PGF2 alpha formation in UV irradiated skin suggesting a role for isoprostanes in UV induced inflammation and eventually carcinogenesis and confirming the function of vitamin E as an antioxidant in this model.",

However, few studies concerning the role and mechanism of EGCG in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are available. Therefore, the antitumor mechanism of EGCG needs to be investigated. The present study aimed to examine the antitumor effect of EGCG on the human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, Eca-109 and Te-1, in vitro and in vivo. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay and tumor formation and growth in murine xenograft models with or without EGCG treatment. Cell cycle analysis and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using flow cytometry. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin/propidium iodide staining. Caspase-3 cleavage and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression were detected using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in tumor cell lines and tumor xenografts, respectively. The results showed that EGCG inhibited proliferation in the Eca-109 and Te-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Tumor cells were arrested in the G1 phase and apoptosis was accompanied by ROS production and caspase-3 cleavage. In a mouse model, EGCG significantly inhibited the growth of Eca-109 tumors by increasing the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and decreasing VEGF protein levels. Taken together, the results suggest that EGCG inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis through ROS production, caspase-3 activation, and a decrease in VEGF expression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, EGCG may have future clinical applications for novel approaches to treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Oxidative stress is one of the major pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) is one of the paramount antioxidant enzymes in COPD. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which is activated by specific ligands such as rosiglitazone (RGZ), exerting multiple biological effects. PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a PPARgamma coactivator, which binds to PPARgamma by induction of PPARgamma ligands, co-activating PPARgamma target genes. Growing evidence has suggested that PPARgamma/PGC-1alpha can regulate multiple antioxidant genes. However, the effect of PPARgamma/PGC-1alpha on gamma-GCS during the development of COPD remains unclear. Here, we measured the expression levels of PPARgamma, PGC-1alpha and gamma-GCS, gamma-GCS activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents in lungs of rats treated by cigarette smoke (CS) + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CS + LPS + RGZ, as well as lungs of patients suffered from COPD. Compared with lungs from CS + LPS-treated rats, lungs of RGZ-treated rats demonstrated markedly lower ROS contents, and remarkable increase of gamma-GCS activity and increase of the expression levels of PPARgamma, PGC-1alpha, and gamma-GCS. Furthermore, compared with controls, expression levels of PPARgamma, PGC-1alpha, and gamma-GCS significantly increased in the lungs of mild COPD patients, and progressively decreased in lungs of patients with moderate and severe COPD. gamma-GCS protein was positively correlated with FEV(1)%. PPARgamma and PGC-1alpha proteins were positively correlated with gamma-GCS activity and mRNA level. In conclusion, gamma-GCS showed compensatory upregulation in the early stage of COPD, which progressively decompensate with increasing COPD severity. The activation of the PPARgamma/PGC-1alpha pathway may protect against COPD progression by upregulating gamma-GCS and relieving oxidative stress.",

Radioresistant tumour models were originally established from human colon cancer cells, and we evaluated their molecular basis. Next, the growth inhibitory effects of newly synthesized vitamin K2 (VK2)-related compounds were tested. Here, we showed that these novel compounds have growth inhibitory effects not only on cancer cells of various origins, but also on radioresistant cells, through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Human colon, lung, and breast cancer cell lines were used for testing the growth inhibitory activities of several chemical compounds. Radioresistant tumour models were established by fractionated radiation exposure. Irradiated cells were selected by a single cell cloning method, and their sensitivity to ionizing radiation was evaluated by a colony-forming assay. The VK2 derivatives (named MQ-1, MQ-2, and MQ-3) were chemically synthesized. To evaluate the generation of ROS, flow cytometer analyses were performed. A radioresistant tumour model was established from the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line. The radioresistant cells from HCT116 also showed resistance to cisplatin. In the radioresistant cells, NF-κB was highly activated. MQ-1, MQ-2, and MQ-3 showed greater growth inhibitory activities than VK2 not only in various cancer cells but also in radioresistant cells through the generation of ROS. In conclusion, a radioresistant tumour model was originally established from colon cancer cell lines through NF-κB activation, and it could be a useful tool for evaluating anti-tumour agents. Newly synthesized VK2 derivatives (MQ-1, MQ-2 and MQ-3) seemed to be potential anti-tumour agents in various cancers and radioresistant cancers.

Due to its large surface area and blood supply, the lung is susceptible to oxidative injury in the form of myriads of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals. In order to provide defense against the oxidative burden, the lungs produce various endogenous agents called antioxidants. The antioxidant species help the lungs ward off the deleterious consequences of a wide variety of oxidants/ROS, either of endogenous or environmental origin. Several mechanisms are related to the potential connection between COPD and oxidative stress. One of the most important actions of the oxidative stress is the influence of the molecular mechanisms involved in the expression proinflammatory genes. There is plenty of evidence supporting an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in the lung and systemic circulation of smokers and COPD patients. Detection of the oxidative burden and evaluation of their progression and phenotypes by oxidative stress biomarkers have proven challenging and difficult. Both invasive and non-invasive techniques have provided different biomarkers which contribute to the oxidative burden of the airways. An effective wide-spectrum antioxidant therapy with bioavailability is urgently needed to control the local and systemic oxidative burst in COPD. In that direction, several antioxidant agents have been evaluated as potential candidates for the management of COPD.

Hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation contributes to the development of BPD in premature infants. Adrenomedullin (AM) is an endogenous peptide with potent angiogenic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Whether AM regulates hyperoxic injury in fetal primary human lung cells is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that AM-deficient fetal primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) will have increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and cytotoxicity compared to AM-sufficient HPMEC upon exposure to hyperoxia. Adrenomedullin gene (Adm) was knocked down in HPMEC by siRNA-mediated transfection and the resultant AM-sufficient and -deficient cells were evaluated for hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, cytotoxicity, and Akt activation. AM-deficient HPMEC had significantly increased hyperoxia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cytotoxicity compared to AM-sufficient HPMEC. Additionally, AM-deficient cell culture supernatants had increased macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and 1β, indicating a heightened inflammatory state. Interestingly, AM deficiency was associated with an abrogated Akt activation upon exposure to hyperoxia. These findings support the hypothesis that AM deficiency potentiates hyperoxic injury in primary human fetal HPMEC via mechanisms entailing Akt activation. ",

Mutations are found throughout the gene, and common molecular consequences of different types of mutation are not known. Knowledge of common molecular consequences would provide insight into molecular etiology of disease. The objective of this study was to determine common molecular consequences across classes of BMPR2 mutation. METHODS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; RESULTS: Increased superoxide and peroxide production, and alterations in genes associated with oxidative stress were a common consequence of stable transfection of vascular smooth muscle cells with three distinct classes of BMPR2 mutation, in the ligand binding domain, the kinase domain, and the cytoplasmic tail domain. Measurement of oxidized lipids in whole lung from transgenic mice expressing a mutation in the BMPR2 cytoplasmic tail showed a 50% increase in isoprostanes and a twofold increase in isofurans, suggesting increased ROS of mitochondrial origin. Immunohistochemistry on BMPR2 transgenic mouse lung showed that oxidative stress was vascular-specific. Electron microscopy showed decreased mitochondrial size and variability in pulmonary vessels from BMPR2 mutant mice. Measurement of oxidized lipids in urine from humans with BMPR2 mutations demonstrated increased ROS, regardless of disease status. Immunohistochemistry on HPAH patient lung confirmed oxidative stress specific to the vasculature.

We hypothesize that ozone-triggered inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1 production regulate neutrophilic airway inflammation through IL-17A. Pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation was induced by extended (72 h) low-dose (0.7 ppm) exposure to ozone. IL-1 receptor 1 (Il1r1)(-/-), Il17a(-/-) mice and the caspase-1 inhibitor acetyl-YVAD-chloromethylketone (Ac-YVAD-cmk) were used for in vivo studies. Cellular inflammation and protein levels in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), cytokines, and IL-17A-producing γδT-cells, as well as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release, and inflammasome activation in lung macrophages were analyzed. Ozone-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation, accompanied an increased production of IL-1β, IL-18, IL-17A, Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), Interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and BALF protein in the lung. Ozone-induced IL-17A production was predominantly in γδT-cells, and Il17a-knockout mice exhibited reduced airway inflammation. Lung macrophages from ozone-exposed mice exhibited higher levels of mitochondrial ROS, enhanced cytosolic mtDNA, increased caspase-1 activation, and higher production of IL-1β. Il1r1-knockout mice or treatment with Ac-YVAD-cmk decreased the IL-17A production and subsequent airway inflammation. Taken together, we demonstrate that ozone-induced IL-17A and neutrophilic airway inflammation is orchestrated by the caspase-1-IL-1 cascade. ",

HepG2 cells treated with B4G2 showed a depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome c, activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). However, Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, did not attenuate B4G2-induced apoptosis, implying that the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis by B4G2 may be independent of caspases. Moreover, pre-treatment with MgCl2, a blocker of Ca2+-dependent permeability transition (PT) pores, attenuated the depolarization of the mitochondrial potential and decreased the population of apoptotic cells, indicating that B4G2-induced apoptosis was partly dependent on the opening of the Ca2+-dependent PT pores. B4G2 also increased the levels of intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, an ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), markedly decreased the accumulation of intracellular calcium and apoptosis.;This is the first demonstration that B4G2 inhibits the growth of HCC cells and induces mitochondrial apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by the ROS-mediated opening of Ca2+-dependent permeability transition pores.",

Many chemotherapeutic agents, such as taxol, docetaxel, and vinblastine, interact with microtubules and then induce apoptosis. It has been suggested that 2-Me acts on microtubules and results in G(2)/M-cycle arrest of tumor cells. Whether 2-Me induces apoptosis in gastric carcinoma cell lines is not known. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by 2-Me may be involved in cytotoxicity of tumor cells. Thus, another objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between cell cycle arrest, ROS formation, and caspase activity levels after 2-Me treatment in gastric carcinoma cells.;It was determined whether 2-Me directly induced apoptosis in two gastric carcinoma cell lines (SC-M1 and NUGC-3) through caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and, eventually, induced DNA fragmentation. To clarify the effect of 2-Me-induced G(2)/M arrest in apoptosis, calcium ionophore, A23187, and thapsigargin were used to modulate 2-Me-induced cell cycle responses. Moreover, the role of 2-Me-induced ROS formation in the cell cycle responses also was evaluated.;It was found that 2-Me treatment resulted in G(2)/M-cycle arrest, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. In addition, the 2-Me induced, concomitant increases of peroxide and superoxide anions were correlated with G(2)/M-cycle arrest. Treatment with calcium ionophore A23187 and thapsigargin partially reversed the 2-Me-induced G(2)/M-cycle arrest, with a concomitant decrease in both peroxide and superoxide levels. Moreover, A23187 blocked the 2-Me-induced caspase-3 activation, whereas thapsigargin had no effect. Treatment with calcium channel blockers did not affect 2-Me-induced cell cycle arrest or caspase-3 activation.;These results suggest that the 2-Me-induced apoptosis of gastric carcinoma cells by DNA fragmentation accompanied caspase activation.

We have therefore investigated the effect of an organic extract of diesel exhaust particles on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) status in human neutrophil granulocytes and rat alveolar macrophages in vitro. ROS formation were studied by three different assays namely the use of DCFH-DA, lucigenin and luminol. The organic extract increased ROS assayed with DCFH-DA, but it decreased the amount of ROS in cells stimulated by PMA in all three assays. The identities of the ROS affected were further studied in cell free systems. The cell free studies confirmed that the extract had scavenging effects against superoxide, hypochlorite and to a smaller extent against peroxynitrite, but not against the hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide.

        "Doc_abstract":"A gas-exchange structure interacts with the environment and is constantly challenged by contaminants that may elicit defense responses, thus compromising its primary function. It is also exposed to high concentrations of O(2) that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Revisiting the lung of mammals, an integrative picture emerges, indicating that this bronchi-alveolar structure deals with inflammation in a special way, which minimizes compromising the gas-exchange role. Depending on the challenge, pro-inflammatory or antiinflammatory responses are elicited by conserved molecules, such as surfactant proteins A and D. An even broader picture points to the participation of airway sensors, responsive to inflammatory mediators, in a loop linking the immunological and nervous systems and expanding the role played by respiratory organs in functions other than gas-exchange. A byproduct of exposure to high concentration of O(2) is the formation of superoxide ( ), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), hydroxyl radical (HO(•)), and other ROS, which are known to be toxic to different types of cells, including the lung epithelium. A balance between antioxidants and oxidants exists; in pulmonary epithelial cells high intracellular and extracellular levels of antioxidants are found. Antioxidant adaptations related to plant and animal life-styles involve a broad range of overlapping strategies based on well-conserved molecules. Glutathione (GSH) is an abundant and ubiquitous thiol-tripeptide antioxidant, also present in lungs, whose role in providing information on the intracellular redox state of animals and plants is well established. In these organisms, GSH influences gene expression associated with stress, maximizing defense responses. Several enzymatic antioxidants, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase participate in the redox system; in animals that are stress-tolerant GPx is a key element against oxidative assaults. Most importantly, alternative roles of ROS as signaling molecules have been found in all plants and animals. For example, alveolar macrophages produce that act as second messengers, in addition to having a bactericidal role. The nonradical ROS H(2)O(2) signals inflammation in mammalian lungs, apoptosis in different animal tissues, and is also involved in stomatal closure, root development, gene expression, and defense responses of plants. Antioxidant adaptations in some water-breathing animals involve the excretion of H(2)O(2) by diffusion through gas-exchange structures. The fine balance among a multitude of factors and cells makes the difference between damage and protection in animals and plants.

The protein levels of HIF1alpha, pyruvate dehydrogenease (PDH), phosphorylated PDH, and pyruvate dehydrogenease kinase 2 (PDK2), together with ROS generation, were compared between the mutant and the wild type.

We also found that the chronic CSE treatment enhanced HIF1α accumulation through increased pyruvate and lactate production in a manner selectively reversible by ascorbate. Use of a HIF1α small molecule inhibitor blocked the growth induced by chronic CSE treatment in OKF6 cells.

Since cisplatin is known to increase intracellular levels of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in cisplatin toxicity selectively in cancer cells could result from further increasing the cisplatin-elevated ROS levels by targeting antioxidant genes upregulated in ovarian cancers. The serine/threonine kinase Mirk/dyrk1B is a transcriptional co-activator which increased the expression of the antioxidant genes superoxide dismutase 2 and ferroxidase in ovarian cancer cells. As a result, depletion of Mirk increased cellular ROS levels in each of 4 ovarian cancer cell lines. Mirk depletion averaged only about 4 fold, yet combined with cisplatin treatment enabled low levels of drug to increase ROS to toxic levels in both SKOV3 and TOV21G ovarian cancer cells. Lowering ROS levels by treatment with N-acetyl cysteine limited cisplatin toxicity, resulting in higher cell numbers and decreased cleavage of the apoptotic proteins PARP and caspase 3. Mirk has also been shown to block cells in G1 by inducing proteolysis of cyclin D1. Mirk depletion increased cyclin D1 levels in 3 of 4 ovarian cancer cell lines, implying that some Mirk depleted cells could more readily enter cycle, potentially increasing their sensitivity to cisplatin. Since Mirk is upregulated in a large subset of human ovarian cancers, but is expressed at low levels in most normal tissues, and embryonic knockout of Mirk results in viable and fertile mice, targeting Mirk may sensitize ovarian cancers to lower levels of cisplatin, while sparing normal tissues.",

In this study, we assessed the effects and potential mechanisms of a ruthenium-based water-soluble CO carrier [tricarbonylchloroglycinate-ruthenium(II) (CORM-3)] in the modulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) inflammatory responses in an experimental model of sepsis. Sepsis in mice was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. CORM-3 (3 mg/kg iv) was administered 15 min after the induction of cecal ligation and puncture. PMN accumulation in the lung (myeloperoxidase assay), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and lung vascular permeability (protein content in BAL fluid) were assessed 6 h later. In in vitro experiments, human PMNs were primed with LPS (10 ng/ml) and subsequently stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP; 100 nM). PMN production of ROS (L-012/dihydrorhodamine-123 oxidation), degranulation (release of elastase), and PMN rolling, adhesion, and migration to/across human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were assessed in the presence or absence of CORM-3 (1-100 muM). The obtained results indicated that systemically administered CORM-3 attenuates PMN accumulation and vascular permeability in the septic lung. Surprisingly, in in vitro experiments, treatment of PMNs with CORM-3 further augmented LPS/fMLP-induced ROS production and the release of elastase. The latter effects, however, were accompanied by an inability of PMNs to mobilize elastase to the cell surface (plasma membrane), an event required for efficient PMN transendothelial migration. The CORM-3-induced decrease in cell surface levels of elastase was followed by decreased PMN rolling/adhesion to HUVECs and complete prevention of PMN migration across HUVECs. In contrast, treatment of HUVECs with CORM-3 had no effect on PMN transendothelial migration. Taken together, these findings indicate that, in sepsis, CORM3-released CO, while further amplifying ROS production and degranulation of PMNs, concurrently reduces the levels of cell surface-bound elastase, which contributes to suppressed PMN transendothelial migration.",

As mutations caused by UV may lead to skin cancer due to oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation, efficient safeguard mechanisms have been developed during evolution. These enclose induction of apoptosis and formation sunburn cells aiming at the removal of premalignant cells. The keratinocyte apoptotic machinery in response to UV consists of both intrinsic/mitochondrial and extrinsic/death receptor-mediated cell-death pathways, which are particularly regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, JNK and p38) and the tumor-suppressor protein p53. For development of skin cancer, it appears that critical steps in apoptosis control are dysregulated leading to resistance both to death ligand-mediated and intrinsic proapoptotic pathways. These particularly include inactivation of p53, as well as activation of EGFR, COX-2 and MAPKs, which result in specific regulation of Bcl-2 proteins, death ligands and death receptors.

Therefore, the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2-) in the pathogenesis of IP in this autoimmune-prone model has been investigated. Nitrite/nitrate levels were increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum from SEB-injected mice. The signal of the NO-(N-(dithiocarboxy) sarcosine)2-Fe2+ complex was detected in the SEB-injected lung and whole blood by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.

Xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the lung, BAL fluid, and plasma was increased with instillation of SEB, and 4-amino-6-hydroxypyrazolo(3,4-d)-pyrimidine (AHPP) significantly inhibited XO activity. Moreover, both AG and AHPP significantly decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, numbers of infiltrated cells in BAL fluid, and the area of thickened alveolar septa in the SEB-injected lung.

Also, the expression of NOX4 was studied in PAFB isolated from the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).

Our current study aimed at defining the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of one set of commercially available 60-nm diameter WC-Co NPs on three human cell lines representative of potential target organs: A549 (lung), Hep3B (liver), and Caki-1 (kidney). The cytotoxicity of WC-Co NPs was determined by evaluating cell impedance (xCELLigence), cell survival/death, and cell cycle checkpoints. Flow cytometry was used to not only evaluate cell cycle checkpoints, but to also estimate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, γ-H2Ax foci detection (confocal microscopy), considered to be the most sensitive technique for studying DNA double-strand breaks, was utilized to evaluate genotoxicity. As a final part of this study, we assessed the cellular incorporation of WC-Co NPs, first byflow cytometry (side scatter), and then by confocal microscopy (light reflection) to ensure that the NPs had entered cells. Overall, our current findings demonstrate that WC-Co NPs induce cell mortality, DNA double-strand breaks, and cell cycle arrest in human renal (Caki-1) and liver (Hep3B) cell lines, but do not induce significant cytotoxic effects in A549 lung cells. Interestingly, although WC-Co NPs effectively entered the cells in all 3 lines tested, ROS were detected in Caki-1 and Hep3B, but not in A549.

Resveratrol had substantially high antioxidant capacity (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity value) compared to trolox and vitamin E since the concentration of resveratrol was more than 50 μM. Nanoparticles prepared from β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) were successfully developed. The β-lg nanoparticle showed 60 to 146 nm diameter in size with negatively charged surface. Non-cytotoxicity was observed in Caco-2 cells treated with β-lg nanoparticles. Fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated β-lg nanoparticles were identified into the cell membrane of Caco-2 cells, indicating that nanoparticles can be used as a delivery system. Hydrogen peroxide caused accumulation of ROS in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

We investigated whether roflumilast N-oxide (RNO), the active metabolite of roflumilast, can modulate in vitro the oxidative effects of BLM on human lung fibroblasts (HLF). In addition, since BLM increases the production of F₂-isoprostanes that have per se fibrogenic activity, the effect of RNO on oxidative stress and fibrogenesis induced by the F₂-isoprostane 8-epi-PGF₂α was investigated. HLF were preincubated either with the vehicle or with RNO and exposed to either BLM or 8-epi-PGF₂α. Proliferation and collagen synthesis were assessed as [(3)H]-thymidine and [(3)H]-proline incorporation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and F₂-isoprostanes were measured. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) protein and mRNA were also evaluated. BLM increased both cell proliferation and collagen synthesis and enhanced ROS and F₂-isoprostane production. These effects were significantly prevented by RNO. Also, RNO significantly reduced the increase in both NOX4 mRNA and protein, induced by BLM. Finally, 8-epi-PGF₂α   per se stimulated HLF proliferation, collagen synthesis, and NOX4 expression and ROS generation, and RNO prevented these effects. Thus, the antifibrotic effect of RNO observed in vivo may be related to its ability to mitigate ROS generation via downregulation of NOX4.",

The pathogenesis of HCC is closely associated with chronic liver inflammation fired by a variety of stimulates such as virus infection and metabolic stress. Recent work indicates that autophagy, a homeostatic self-degradation process, which decides cell survival or death upon stress, acts as an effector machinery of immune systems in defending microbial invasion and carcinogenesis. SQSTM1 is a selective target and receptor of autophagy, and the protein content of SQSTM1 reflects the level of autophagic flux in cells. Through degrading SQSTM1, decreasing SQSTM1 aggregates, and therefore interrupting the positive feedback between SQSTM1 aggregates and ROS production, autophagy plays a protective role against hepatocellular carcinoma. Indeed, our studies indicate that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated immune activities in the genotoxic carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-injured liver tissue provide essential nutrient stimulates to induce intracellular senescence, which can ensure the activation and maturation of autophagy in liver cells. Loss of TLR2-mediated immune activity and senescence leads to the attenuation of autophagic flux, which cannot eliminate SQSTM1 aggregates, ROS accumulation, and DNA damage, and facilitates the development and progression of HCC.",

The effect of inhibiting lung antioxidant defense on in vivo development of AIPT was evaluated in hamsters. Lung glutathione reductase activity was inhibited by 66%, 6 hours following administration of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) (20 mg/kg i.p.). When AM (1.83 mumol) was administered intratracheally 6 hours after BCNU, toxicity was enhanced, as indicated by lung hydroxyproline content and histological evaluation 21 days later. However, BCNU treatment did not affect AM-induced alterations in lung glutathione, suggesting that the increased toxicity was not due to decreased antioxidant capacity following BCNU. The effect of BCNU on AM cytotoxicity in vitro was evaluated using rabbit lung alveolar macrophages. Incubation with 5 microM BCNU for 2 hours caused greater than 95% inhibition of glutathione reductase activity. However, BCNU treatment had no effect on 146 microM AM-induced cytotoxicity, as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase latency following 12 hours of incubation. Rabbit macrophages loaded with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein, which is oxidized by ROS to fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), were used to evaluate ROS generation by AM. Incubation of macrophages with AM (73 or 146 microM) for 1 hour, with or without the catalase inhibitor sodium azide (1 mM), did not result in DCF formation. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis that AIPT is due to ROS action.",

Other less frequent causes are associated with indirect cigarette smoke, air pollutants, biomass fuels, and genetic mutations. COPD is often associated with heart disease, lung cancer, osteoporosis and conditions can worsen in patients with sudden falls. COPD also affects both innate and adaptive immune processes. Cigarette smoke increases the expression of matrix metalloproteases and proinflammatory chemokines and increases lung titers of natural killer cells and neutrophils. Yet, neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by the phagocytic respiratory burst and phagocytosis is impaired by nicotine. In contrast to innate immunity in COPD, dendritic cells represent leukocytes recruited to the lung that link the innate immune responses to adaptive immune responses by activating naïve T cells through antigen presentation. The autoimmune process that is also a significant part of inflammation associated with COPD. Moreover, coupled with restricted FEV1 values, are the prevalence of patients with single or multiple infections by bacteria, viruses and fungi. Finally, we focus on one of the more problematic infectious agents, the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Specifically, we delve into the development of highly problematic biofilm infections that are highly refractory to conventional antibiotic therapies in COPD.

In this study, we examined a late caspase-independent apoptosis as well as an early caspase-dependent apoptosis in cisplatin-treated HN4 cells. While z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, blocked the caspase activities and protected cells from the early apoptosis, it did not provide protection against delayed apoptosis occurring after extended exposure (16 hr) to cisplatin, suggesting that the delayed apoptotic response in the presence of z-VAD-fmk was caspase-independent. Cisplatin treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and nuclear translocation of endonuclease G (EndoG). Small interfering RNA mediated-knockdown of EndoG significantly protected cells from the delayed apoptosis induced by cisplatin in the presence of z-VAD-fmk. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in HN4 cells prevented loss of MMP, nuclear translocation of EndoG and protected cells from the delayed apoptosis induced by cisplatin in the presence of z-VAD-fmk. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, prevented both ROS generation, loss of the MMP and nuclear translocation of EndoG. Together, our data indicate that cisplatin treatment induced ROS-mediated loss of the MMP, and, then, the nuclear translocation of EndoG, which played a crucial role in caspase-independent apoptosis of HN4 cells in the presence of z-VAD-fmk.

The data indicate that VOPP1 knockdown induces cell death at 72 h post-transfection and this is caused by the induction of apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. Analysis of microarray gene expression profiling showed that genes whose expression was affected by VOPP1 knockdown exhibited enrichment in annotations of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Reporters of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential show that ROS levels become elevated and mitochondrial dysfunction occurs with VOPP1 knockdown at time points before the activation of effector caspases and cell death seen at later time points. Furthermore, the introduction of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine was able to abrogate the induction of apoptosis observed with VOPP1 knockdown in a dose-responsive manner. Reporter constructs for NF-κB-mediated transcription are not affected in SCC cell lines by VOPP1 knockdown.

        "Doc_abstract":"The mechanisms controlling apoptosis remain largely obscure. Because apoptosis is an integral part of the developmental program and is frequently the end-result of a temporal course of cellular events, it is referred to as programmed cell death. While there is considerable variation in the signals and requisite cellular metabolic events necessary to induce apoptosis in diverse cell types, the morphological features associated with apoptosis are highly conserved. Free radicals, particularly reactive oxygen species (ROS), have been proposed as common mediators for apoptosis. Many agents that induce apoptosis are either oxidants or stimulators of cellular oxidative metabolism. Conversely, many inhibitors of apoptosis have antioxidant activities or enhance cellular antioxidant defenses. Mammalian cells, therefore, exist in a state of oxidative siege in which survival requires an optimum balance of oxidants and antioxidants. The respiratory tract is subjected to a variety of environmental stresses, including oxidizing agents, particulates and airborne microorganisms that, together, may injure structural and functional lung components and thereby jeopardize the primary lung function of gas exchange. To cope with this challenge, the lung has developed elaborate defense mechanisms that include inflammatory-immune pathways as well as efficient antioxidant defense systems. In the absence of adequate antioxidant defenses, the damage produced is detected by the cell leading to the activation of genes responsible for the regulation of apoptosis, conceivably through stress-responsive transcription factors. Oxidative stress, in addition, may cause a shift in cellular redox state, which thereby modifies the nature of the stimulatory signal and which results in cell death as opposed to proliferation. ROS/redox modifications, therefore, may disrupt signal transduction pathways, can be perceived as abnormal and, under some conditions, may trigger apoptosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activated oncogenes induce premature cellular senescence, a permanent state of proliferative arrest in primary rodent and human fibroblasts. Recent studies suggest that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in oncogenic Ras-induced premature senescence. However, the signaling mechanism controlling this oxidant-mediated irreversible growth arrest is not fully understood. Here, we show that through the Ras/MEK pathway, Ras oncogene up-regulated the expression of superoxide-generating oxidases, Nox1 in rat REF52 cells and Nox4 in primary human lung TIG-3 cells, leading to an increase in intracellular level of ROS. Ablation of Nox1 and Nox4 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) blocked the RasV12 senescent phenotype including β-galactosidase activity, growth arrest and accumulation of tumor suppressors such as p53 and p16Ink4a. This suggests that Nox-generated ROS transduce senescence signals by activating the p53 and p16Ink4a pathway. Furthermore, Nox1 and Nox4 siRNAs inhibited both Ras-induced DNA damage response and p38MAPK activation, whereas overexpression of Nox1 and Nox4 alone was able to induce senescence. The involvement of Nox1 in Ras-induced senescence was also confirmed with embryonic fibroblasts derived from Nox1 knockout mice. Together, these findings suggest that Nox1- and Nox4-generated ROS play an important role in Ras-induced premature senescence, which may involve DNA damage response and p38MAPK signaling pathways.",

Research has suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as signaling molecules in cancer cell proliferation and migration. However, the mechanisms linking eIF5A2 and ROS are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the effects of ROS on the eIF5A2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration in six hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Western hybridization, siRNA transfection, transwell migration assays, wound-healing assays, and immunofluorescence analysis were used. The protein levels of eIF5A2 in tumor and adjacent tissue samples from 90 HCC patients with detailed clinical, pathological, and clinical follow-up data were evaluated. Overexpression of eIF5A2 was found in cancerous tissues compared with adjacent tissues. We found that eIF5A2 overexpression in HCC was associated with reduced overall survival. Knockdown of eIF5A2 and intracellular reduction of ROS significantly suppressed the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. Interestingly, N1-guanyl-1, 7-diaminoheptane (GC7) suppressed the intracellular ROS levels. After blocking the EMT, administration of GC7 or N-acetyl-L-cysteine did not reduce cell migration further. Based on the experimental data, we concluded that inhibition of eIF5A2 alters progression of the EMT to decrease the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells via ROS-related pathways. ",

The synthesis of 80 piperlongumine analogs has revealed structural modifications that retain, enhance, and ablate key piperlongumine-associated effects on cells, including elevation of ROS, cancer cell death, and selectivity for cancer cells over nontransformed cell types. Structure/activity relationships suggest that the electrophilicity of the C2-C3 olefin is critical for the observed effects on cells. Furthermore, we show that analogs lacking a reactive C7-C8 olefin can elevate ROS to levels observed with piperlongumine but show markedly reduced cell death, suggesting that ROS-independent mechanisms, including cellular cross-linking events, may also contribute to piperlongumine's induction of apoptosis. In particular, we have identified irreversible protein glutathionylation as a process associated with cellular toxicity.

Here, we report that exercise-induced T-lymphocyte apoptosis is a systemic phenomenon occurring in various lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. The apoptosis rate could be related to exercise intensity and type. Although in some tissues, such as the spleen and Peyer's patches, an early start of apoptosis (1-3 h postexercise) could be detected, a delayed apoptosis (24 h postexercise) was observed in lung, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Further analysis showed a similar apoptosis distribution among lymphocyte subpopulations. We tested whether components of the extrinsic or the intrinsic apoptotic pathways or both were involved in these processes. Elevated levels of lipid peroxidation-product malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were found after exercise in Peyer's patches, lung, and spleen, but not in lymph nodes. Application of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) prevented exercise-induced T-cell apoptosis completely in spleen and bone marrow, partially in lung and Peyer's patches, while it was ineffective in lymph nodes. Additionally, exercise addressed the Fas-mediated apoptosis. The percentage of Fas-receptor (Fas+) and Fas-ligand positive (FasL+) lymphocytes was enhanced in Peyer's patches after exercise. Moreover, FasL+ T cells were increased in the lung, while in lymph nodes Fas+ cells were increased. The critical role of Fas signaling in exercise-induced apoptosis was supported by using Fas-deficient MRL/lpr-mice. In Fas-deficient mice, exercise-induced T-lymphocyte apoptosis was prevented in spleen, lung, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, but not in Peyer's patches. These data demonstrate that exercise-induced lymphocyte apoptosis is a transient systemic process with tissue-type specific apoptosis-inducing mechanisms, whose relevance for the adaptive immune competence remains to be shown.",

A panel of eleven human cancer cell lines, glioblastoma and carcinoma, were exposed to serial dilutions of ascorbic acid (5-100 mmol/L). The purpose of this study was to analyse the impact of catalase, an important hydrogen peroxide-detoxifying enzyme, on the resistance of cancer cells to ascorbic acid mediated oxidative stress.;Effective concentration (EC(50)) values, which indicate the concentration of ascorbic acid that reduced the number of viable cells by 50%, were detected with the crystal violet assay. The level of intracellular catalase protein and enzyme activity was determined. Expression of catalase was silenced by catalase-specific short hairpin RNA (sh-RNA) in BT-20 breast carcinoma cells. Oxidative cell stress induced apoptosis was measured by a caspase luminescent assay.;The tested human cancer cell lines demonstrated obvious differences in their resistance to ascorbic acid mediated oxidative cell stress. Forty-five percent of the cell lines had an EC(50) > 20 mmol/L and fifty-five percent had an EC(50) < 20 mmol/L. With an EC(50) of 2.6-5.5 mmol/L, glioblastoma cells were the most susceptible cancer cell lines analysed in this study. A correlation between catalase activity and the susceptibility to ascorbic acid was observed. To study the possible protective role of catalase on the resistance of cancer cells to oxidative cell stress, the expression of catalase in the breast carcinoma cell line BT-20, which cells were highly resistant to the exposure to ascorbic acid (EC(50): 94,9 mmol/L), was silenced with specific sh-RNA. The effect was that catalase-silenced BT-20 cells (BT-20 KD-CAT) became more susceptible to high concentrations of ascorbic acid (50 and 100 mmol/L).;Fifty-five percent of the human cancer cell lines tested were unable to protect themselves against oxidative stress mediated by ascorbic acid induced hydrogen peroxide production.

In this study with OVA-inhaled mice, the increased ROS generation, the increased levels of Th2 cytokines and VEGF, the increased vascular permeability, the increased mucus production, and the increased airway resistance in the lungs were significantly reduced by the administration of AD4. We also found that the administration of AD4 decreased the increases of the NF-kappaB and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) levels in nuclear protein extracts of lung tissues after OVA inhalation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Subchronic exposure to arsenic increases the incidence of human cancers such as skin, lung, colon, and rectal cancer. The mechanism for arsenic-induced tumorigenesis is still not clear. It is generally believed that DNA damage and genomic instability, generated by arsenic-promoted oxidative stress, account largely for this process. The major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are arsenic-damaged mitochondria. Autophagy is a catabolic process functioning in turnover of long-lived proteins and dysfunctional organelles such as mitochondria. Defects of autophagy under stress conditions promote genomic instability and increase the risk of tumorigenesis. In the present study using a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B cells, we investigated the role of autophagy in arsenic-induced cell transformation, an important step in arsenic tumorigenesis. Our results show that subchronic arsenic exposure induces BEAS-2B cell transformation accompanied with increased ROS generation and autophagy activation. However, the patterns for ROS and autophagy alteration are different. Arsenic exposure generated a prolonged and steady increase of ROS levels, whereas the activation of autophagy, after an initial boost by arsenic administration, decreases in response to subchronic arsenic exposure, although the activity is still higher than a nontreated control. Further stimulation of autophagy increases mitochondria turnover and decreases ROS generation and arsenic-induced cell transformation. Contrarily, inhibition of autophagy activity decreases mitochondria turnover and enhances arsenic-induced ROS generation and cell transformation. In addition, the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway is involved in arsenic-mediated autophagy activation. Our results suggest that autophagy is a cell self-protective mechanism against arsenic-induced cell transformation.",

Biol. 10:57-69, 2009.-Hypoxic preco759nditioning (HPC) provides robust protection against injury from subsequent prolonged hypobaric hypoxia, which is a characteristic of high altitude and is known to induce oxidative injury in lung by increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing the effectiveness of the antioxidant defense system. We hypothesize that HPC with cobalt might protect the lung from subsequent hypobaric hypoxia-induced lung injury. HPC with cobalt can be achieved by oral feeding of CoCl(2) (12.5 mg kg(-1)) in rats for 7 days. Nonpreconditioned rats responded to hypobaric hypoxia (7619 m) by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. They also showed a marked increase in lipid peroxidation, heat-shock proteins (HSP32, HSP70), metallothionins (MT), levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1), and SOD, GPx, and GST enzyme activity. In contrast, rats preconditioned with cobalt were far less impaired by severe hypobaric hypoxia, as observed by decreased ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory cytokine release and an inceased GSH/GSSG ratio. Increased expression of antioxidative proeins Nrf-1, HSP-32, and MT was also observed in cobalt- preconditioned animals. A marked increase in the protein expression and DNA binding activity of hypoxia-inducible transcriptional factor (HIF-1alpha) and its regulated genes, such as erythropoietin (EPO) and glucose transporter-1 (glut-1), was observed after HPC with cobalt. We conclude that HPC with cobalt enhances antioxidant status in the lung and protects from subsequent hypobaric hypoxia-induced oxidative stress.",

Our present study aims to investigate the antihepatocellular carcinoma effects of LQ both in cell and animal models. LQ strikingly reduced cell viability, enhanced apoptotic rate, induced lactate dehydrogenase over-release, and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and caspase 3 activity in both PLC/PRL/5 and HepG2 cells. The expression of cleaved PARP, the hall-marker of apoptosis, was enhanced by LQ. LQ treatment resulted in a reduction of the expressions of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), and an increase of the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and P38. LQ-mediated cell viability reduction, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis related protein abnormal expressions, and JNK and P38 activation were partially abolished by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (a ROS inhibitor) pretreatment. Moreover, LQ suppressed the activation of extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERKs) and reduced the translocation of phosphor-ERKs from cytoplasm to nucleus. This antitumor activity was further confirmed in PLC/PRL/5-xenografted mice model. All these data indicate that the antihepatocellular carcinoma effects of LQ are related to its modulation of the activations of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs). The study provides experimental evidence supporting LQ as a potential therapeutic agent for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment. ",

Although various mechanisms for the effects of LLLT have been proposed, and intracellular ROS were indicated as the one of the key factors, direct measurement of intracellular ROS of several types of cells after different wavelength lasers irradiation has not been reported.;Various types of cells were used in this study: mouse preadipocytes (3T3-L1), prechondrocytes (ATDC5), myoblasts (C2C12), mesenchymal stromal cells (KUSA-A1), lung cancer cells (LLC), insulinoma cells (MIN6), fibroblasts (NIH-3T3), human cervix adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), macrophages differentiated from lymphocytes (THP-1) after treatment with phorbol ester, and rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). Cells were irradiated with a blue laser (wavelength: 405 nm), a red laser (wavelength: 664 nm) or a near infrared laser (wavelength: 808 nm) at 100 mW/cm(2) for 60 or 120 sec. Intracellular ROS levels were measured by fluorometric assay using the intracellular ROS probe, CM-H2DCFDA in a flow cytometer.;After a blue laser irradiation, intracellular ROS levels were increased in all types of cells. In contrast, intracellular ROS generation was not observed after irradiation with a red laser or near-infrared laser.;Potential sources of intracellular ROS were excited by blue laser irradiation, resulting in ROS production within cells. Although the low-level intracellular ROS should be generated after a red or a near-infrared laser irradiation, the only high level intracellular ROS were detected by the ROS probe used in this study. As ROS are considered to be key secondary messengers, the specific functional regulation of cells by laser irradiation will be studied in a future study.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Search for novel anticancer lead molecules continues to be a major focus of cancer research due to the limitations of existing drugs such as lack of tumor selectivity, narrow therapeutic index and multidrug resistance of cancer types. Natural molecules often possess better pharmacokinetic traits compared to synthetic molecules as they continually evolve by natural selection process to interact with biological macromolecules. Microbial metabolites constitute nearly half of the pharmaceuticals in market today. Endophytic fungi, owing to its rich chemical diversity, are viewed as attractive sources of novel bioactive compounds. In the present study, we report the purification and characterization of a novel steroidal saponin, cholestanol glucoside (CG) from Saraca asoca endophytic fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae. The compound was assessed for its cytotoxic potentialities in six human cancer cell lines, A549, PC3, HepG2, U251, MCF7 and OVCAR3. CG exhibited significant cytotoxicities towards A549, PC3 and HepG2 among which A549 cells were most vulnerable to CG treatment. However, CG treatment exhibited negligible cytotoxicity in non malignant human lung fibroblast cell line (WI-38). Induction of cell death by CG treatment in A549 cells was further investigated. CG induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane permeability loss followed by apoptotic cell death. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptotic cell death in CG treated A549 cells were completely blocked in presence of an antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Hence it could be concluded that CG initiates apoptosis in cancer cells by augmenting the basal oxidative stress and that the generation of intracellular ROS is crucial for the induction of apoptosis.

RNS had a differential effect against cytotoxicity of MMC depending on concentration. Viability loss in cells exposed to MMC was decreased by inhibitors of caspase-3, -8 and -9 and attenuated by antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine, dithiothreitol, ascorbate and rutin). Addition of 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) differentially affected the MMC-induced cell death and GSH depletion concentration dependently with a maximal inhibitory effect at 150 microM. Ascorbate, superoxide dismutase and haemoglobin prevented the inhibitory effect of 150 microM SIN-1 on 10 microg/ml MMC-induced cell death. SIN-1 inhibited the MMC-induced nuclear damage, loss in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation, increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and depletion of GSH. SIN-1 also attenuated cell death due to H(2)O(2). The cytotoxicity of MMC in the presence of oxidants or RNS producers was much less than the sum of the each effect of MMC and producer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidemiological studies demonstrate associations between increasing levels of ambient particles and morbidity in the elderly with cardiopulmonary disease. Such findings have been challenged partly because particles may not act alone to cause these effects. We hypothesized that carbonaceous ambient ultrafine particles and ozone can act together to induce greater oxidative stress and inflammation in the lung than when administered alone and that these effects would be amplified in the compromised, aging lung. Two models of a compromised lung were used: endotoxin priming and old-age emphysema (TSK mice). Young (10 wk) and old (22 mo) male F344 rats and male TSK mice (14-17 mo) were exposed to ultrafine carbon particles (count median diameter 25 nm, 110 micrograms/m3) and to ozone (1 ppm) alone and in combination for 6 h. Inhalation of low-dose endotoxin (70 and 7.5 units estimated alveolar deposited dose in rats and mice, respectively) was used to model respiratory-tract infection. Cellular and biochemical lavage parameters and oxidant release from lung lavage cells were assessed 24 h after exposure. Inflammatory cell influx into the alveolar space was observed for both species and age groups: The combination of inhaled ultrafine carbon and ozone after endotoxin priming resulted in the greatest increase in lavage-fluid neutrophils. In general, the unstimulated and stimulated release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from lavage inflammatory cells correlated well with the neutrophil response. There were significant effects of carbon particles as well as a consistent interaction between carbon and ozone as determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, this interaction was in the opposite direction in young rats versus old rats and old TSK mice: Carbon and ozone interacted such that ROS activity was depressed in young rats, whereas it was enhanced in old rats and old TSK mice, indicating age-dependent functional differences in elicited pulmonary inflammatory cells. These results demonstrate that ultrafine carbonaceous particles inhaled for short periods of time can induce significant pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress that are modified by age, copollutants, and a compromised respiratory tract.",

Thus, to evaluate the toxic and genotoxic effect of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on lung cells in vivo, eight-week-old rats were divided into four groups (each group = 25 animals), a fresh air control (0 mg/m(3)), low (0.17 mg/m(3)), middle (0.49 mg/m(3)), and high (0.96 mg/m(3)) dose group, and exposed to MWCNTs via nose-only inhalation 6 h per day, 5 days per week for 28 days. The count median length and geometric standard deviation for the MWCNTs determined by TEM were 330.18 and 1.72 nm, respectively, and the MWCNT diameters ranged from 10 to 15 nm. Lung cells were isolated from five male and five female rats in each group on day 0, day 28 (only from males) and day 90 following the 28-day exposure. The total number of animals used was 15 male and 10 female rats for each concentration group. To determine the genotoxicity of the MWCNTs, a single cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet assay) was conducted on the rat lung cells. As a result of the exposure, the olive tail moments were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the male and female rats from all the exposed groups when compared with the fresh air control. In addition, the high-dose exposed male and middle and high-dose exposed female rats retained DNA damage, even 90 days post-exposure (p < 0.05). To investigate the mode of genotoxicity, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, TGF- β, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-γ) were also measured. For the male rats, the H2O2 levels were significantly higher in the middle (0 days post-exposure) and high- (0 days and 28 days post-exposure) dose groups (p < 0.05). Conversely, the female rats showed no changes in the H2O2 levels. The inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid did not show any statistically significant difference.

The results indicate that 15d-PGJ2 caused cytotoxicity and increased the amount of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these cells. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors (carbonyl cyanide m-chloro-phenylhydrazone, oligomycin, cyclosporin A and rotenone), NADPH oxidase inhibitor (diphenyleneiodonium), xanthine oxidase inhibitor (allopurinol) and NO synthase inhibitor (N-monomethyl-L-arginine acetate) did not reduce the generation of ROS. However, catalase, N-acetyl-cysteine and the iron chelator desferri-oxamine decreased the intracellular ROS of 15d-PGJ2-treated CG3 cells. Furthermore, 15d-PGJ2 enhanced the accumulation of iron in the CG3 cells.

Recent evidence suggests oxidative stress as a key player in the establishment/progression of lung fibrosis in animal models and possibly in human IPF. The aim of the present study was to characterize the cellular phenotype of fibroblasts derived from IPF patients and identify underlying molecular mechanisms.;We first analyzed the baseline differentiation features and growth ability of primary lung fibroblasts derived from 7 histology proven IPF patients and 4 control subjects at different culture passages. Then, we focused on the redox state and related molecular pathways of IPF fibroblasts and investigated the impact of oxidative stress in the establishment of the IPF phenotype. IPF fibroblasts were differentiated into alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive myofibroblasts, displayed a pro-fibrotic phenotype as expressing type-I collagen, and proliferated lower than controls cells. The IPF phenotype was inducible upon oxidative stress in control cells and was sensitive to ROS scavenging. IPF fibroblasts also contained large excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the activation of an NADPH oxidase-like system, displayed higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and were more resistant to oxidative-stress induced cell death. Interestingly, the IPF traits disappeared with time in culture, indicating a transient effect of the initial trigger.;Robust expression of α-SMA and type-I collagen, high and uniformly-distributed ROS levels, resistance to oxidative-stress induced cell death and constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase(s) signalling are distinctive features of the IPF phenotype. We suggest that this phenotype can be used as a model to identify the initial trigger of IPF.",

NFkappaB activation by 2.5 microm particulates (PM2.5) was evident from the degradation of an NFkappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha, and a luciferase reporter assay for NFkappaB activity. In these experiments, a pre-treatment of the cells with antioxidants N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and dimethylthiourea (DMTU) or an iNOS inhibitor l-N6-1-iminoethyl-lysine (L-NIL) clearly inhibited the NFkappaB activation by PM2.5. The inhibitory effect of L-NIL was also observed on the PM2.5-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression both at the transcriptional and protein levels.

The cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic death invoked by the depletion of Fer were found to depend on the activity of p53. Accordingly, down regulation of Fer led to the activation of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated protein (ATM) and its down-stream effector-p53. Knock-down of Fer also increased the level of Reactive-Oxygen Species (ROS) in CC cells, and subjection of Fer depleted cells to ROS neutralizing scavengers significantly decreased the induced phosphorylation and activation of ATM and p53. Notably, over-expression of Fer opposed the Doxorubicin driven activation of ATM and p53, which can be mediated by ROS.

In the present study we investigated the cytotoxic effects of increasing ROS level using bortezomib in combination with cisplatin on HLRCC cells in vitro and in an in vivo xenograft model. The cytotoxic effect of several ROS inducers on FH-deficient cells was assessed by synthetic lethality. ROS inducers had a pronounced impact on the viability of FH-deficient cells. Because of its high potency, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was further investigated. Bortezomib induced apoptosis in vitro in HLRCC cells and inhibited HLRCC tumour growth in vivo. Bortezomib-associated cytotoxicity was highly correlated with cellular ROS level: combining bortezomib with other ROS inducers enhanced cytotoxicity, while combining bortezomib with a ROS scavenger inhibited its cytotoxic effect. Finally, HLRCC murine xenografts were treated with bortezomib and cisplatin, another ROS inducer. This regimen induced HLRCC tumour regression in vivo. These findings suggest that increasing ROS level in HLRCC above a certain threshold can induce HLRCC-tumor cell death.

Importantly, in nude mice inoculated with HCC Huh7 cells, we demonstrated a synergistic inhibitory effect of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone and the AKT inhibitor triciribine on tumor growth. In conclusion, we observed a negative feedback loop between oxidative stress and AKT hyperactivation in PPARγ agonist-mediated suppressive effects on HCCs.

Here, we review the evidence from epidemiology, toxicology, and lung bioavailability as to whether iron oxides are likely to act as human lung carcinogens. Current evidence suggests that observed lung tumors in rats result from a generic particle overload effect and local inflammation that is rat-specific under the dosing conditions of intratracheal instillation. This mode of action therefore, is not relevant to human exposure. However, there are emerging differences seen in vitro, in cell uptake and cell bioavailability between \"bulk\" iron oxides and \"nano\" iron oxides. \"Bulk\" particulates, as defined here, are those where greater than 70% are >100 nm in diameter. Similarly, \"nano\" iron oxides are defined in this context as particulates where the majority, usually >95% for pure engineered forms of primary particulates (not agglomerates), fall in the range 1-100 nm in diameter. From the weight of scientific evidence, \"bulk\" iron oxides are not genotoxic/mutagenic. Recent evidence for \"nano\" iron oxide is conflicting regarding genotoxic potential, albeit genotoxicity was not observed in an in vivo acute oral dose study, and \"nano\" iron oxides are considered safe and are being investigated for biomedical uses; there is no specific in vivo genotoxicity study on \"nano\" iron oxides via inhalation. Some evidence is available that suggests, hypothetically due to the larger surface area of \"nano\" iron oxide particulates, that toxicity could be exerted via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. However, the potential for ROS generation as a basis for explaining rodent tumorigenicity is only apparent if free iron from intracellular \"nano\" scale iron oxide becomes bioavailable at significant levels inside the cell. This would not be expected from \"bulk\" iron oxide particulates. Furthermore, human epidemiological evidence from a number of studies suggests that iron oxide is not a human carcinogen, and therefore, based upon the complete weight of evidence, we conclude that \"bulk\" iron oxides are not human carcinogens.

Apoptosis was detected by the change of cell morphology and flow cytometry analysis. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and mitochondria membrane potential (Δψm) were determined by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to quantify the expression of apoptosis-related and stress-induced signaling molecules.;Subamolide A selectively induced apoptosis in two cancerous human urothelial carcinoma cell lines (NTUB1 and T24) in comparison with normal immortalized uroepithelial cells (SV-HUC-1). Subamolide A reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and caused apoptosis of NTUB1 cells. Subamolide A increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratios, the amount of cytochrome c released from the mitochondria, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, activated p53 and ERK1/2 and ultimately led to apoptosis in NTUB1 cells. Furthermore, a higher dose (10μM) of subamolide A synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and gemcitabine in NTUB1 cells.;The current study demonstrated that subamolide A triggered the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways and p53 and ERK1/2 activation in the human urothelial carcinoma cell line NTUB1. In addition, subamolide A synergistically enhanced cytotoxic effect of CDDP and Gem in NTUB1. These data suggested that subamolide A exhibited a potent anti-proliferation activity.

To date, seven members of this family have been reported, including Nox1-5 and Duox1 and -2. With the exception of Nox2, the regulation of the Nox enzymes is still poorly understood. Nox1 is highly expressed in the colon, and it requires two cytosolic regulators, NoxO1 and NoxA1, as well as the binding of Rac1 GTPase, for its activity. In this study, we investigate the role of the tyrosine kinase c-Src in the regulation of ROS formation by Nox1. We show that c-Src induces Nox1-mediated ROS generation in the HT29 human colon carcinoma cell line through a Rac-dependent mechanism. Treatment of HT29 cells with the Src inhibitor PP2, expression of a kinase-inactive form of c-Src, and c-Src depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduce both ROS generation and the levels of active Rac1. This is associated with decreased Src-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the Rac1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2. Consistent with this, Vav2 siRNA that specifically reduces endogenous Vav2 protein is able to dramatically decrease Nox1-dependent ROS generation and abolish c-Src-induced Nox1 activity. Together, these results establish c-Src as an important regulator of Nox1 activity, and they may provide insight into the mechanisms of tumor formation in colon cancers.",

Here we report an investigation on the effect of a combined treatment on human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 cells using low-intensity ultrasound (US) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).;The uptake of 5-FU was measured by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). DNA damage was detected by the comet assay. MTT assay was used to examine cell viability. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were respectively detected by the fluorescent probes DCFH-DA or JC-1. Endogenous apoptosis-associated proteins were analyzed by the western blot and immunohistochemistry. Histopathological changes were evaluated by the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by the TUNEL and flow cytometry assays. Cell proliferation was measured using the immunohistochemical staining of PCNA.;Our results showed that low-intensity US (1.1 MHz, 1.0 W/cm2, 10% duty cycle) significantly enhanced the uptake of 5-FU, 5-FU-mediated DNA damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The increased ROS production up-regulated the p53 protein level, which led to the up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2. The enhancement of ROS generation and the activation of the apoptosis-associated proteins further triggered the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol and activated the mitochondria-caspase pathway, and cell apoptosis. Such enhanced effects could be partially blocked by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Overall, low-intensity US combined with 5-FU led to an effective inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged overall survival of BEL-7402 HCC-bearing nude mice by more than 15% compared with 5-FU treatment alone.;Our results showed that low-intensity ultrasound combined with 5-FU produced much enhanced synergistic anti-tumor effects via enhanced ROS production in treating HCC.",

In patients with CF, lack of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel function leads to progressive pulmonary damage and ultimately to death. Severe and persistent polymorphonuclear neutrophil-dominated endobronchial inflammation and chronic bacterial infection are characteristic hallmarks of CF lung disease. Whether CFTR dysfunction results directly in an increased predisposition to infection and whether inflammation arises independent of infection remains to be established. The loss of functional CFTR in airway epithelial cells promotes depletion and increased oxidation of the airway surface liquid. Activated neutrophils present in airways produce large amounts of proteases and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Together these changes are associated with diminished mucociliary clearance of bacteria, activation of epithelial cell signalling through multiple pathways, and subsequent hyperinflammatory responses in CF airways. The NF-kappaB pathway and Ca(2+) mobilization in airway epithelial cells are believed to be of key importance for control of lung inflammation through regulated production of mediators such as interleukin-8 that participate in recruitment and activation of neutrophils, modulation of apoptosis, and control of epithelial barrier integrity. In this review, the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which airway epithelial cells contribute to abnormal lung inflammation in CF, as well as the anti-inflammatory strategies that can be proposed are discussed.",

While the signaling pathways activated after binding of TNF to the TNF receptor (TNFR) and subsequent insertion of Bid/Bax/Bik into the outer mitochondrial membrane are relatively well known, other cell death pathways and the participating signaling molecules remain to be clarified. BNip3 is a pro-death protein and a member of the BH3-only Bcl-2 family. When ectopically overexpressed or induced by hypoxia, BNip3 induces various types of cell death via mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial death cascades. In this study using A549 alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, we show that BNip3 is transcriptionally and translationally upregulated by TNF, and its expression level determines the sensitivity to necroptosis induced by TNF. However, BNip3 does not appear to be involved in caspase-8/Bid-dependent apoptotic cell death in these alveolar lung cells. Finally, we show that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for mitochondrial insertion of BNip3, which is an important step in BNip3-induced mitochondrial catastrophe.

The increased oxidative stress in patients with COPD is the result of an increased burden of inhaled oxidants, as well as increased amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by various inflammatory, immune and epithelial cells of the airways. Oxidative stress has important implications on several events of lung physiology and for the pathogenesis of COPD. These include oxidative inactivation of antiproteases and surfactants, mucus hypersecretion, membrane lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial respiration, alveolar epithelial injury, remodeling of extracellular matrix, and apoptosis. An increased level of ROS produced in the airways is reflected by increased markers of oxidative stress in the airspaces, sputum, breath, lungs, and blood in patients with COPD. The biomarkers of oxidative stress such as H2O2, F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal have been successfully measured in breath condensate. ROS and aldehydes play a key role in enhancing the inflammation through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and redox-sensitive transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B and activator protein-1. Oxidative stress also alters nuclear histone acetylation and deacetylation leading to increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in the lung. Oxidative stress may play a role in the poor clinical efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD. Since a variety of oxidants, free radicals, and aldehydes are implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD it is likely that a combination of antioxidants may be effective in the treatment of COPD.

The antioxidant enzymes (AOEs) superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (which decompose and H(2)O(2), respectively), conjugated with an antibody to platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), bind to endothelial cells and alleviate oxidative stress in cell culture models. Here, we studied the effects of these antioxidant conjugates in mouse models of vascular oxidative stress. Anti-PECAM/catalase and anti-PECAM/SOD conjugates, in contrast to control IgG/AOE conjugates, accumulated in the lungs and vascularized organs after intravenous injection in wild-type, but not PECAM KO mice. Anti-PECAM/catalase, but not anti-PECAM/SOD, protected mice from lung injury induced by H(2)O(2) produced by glucose oxidase deposited in the pulmonary vasculature. Anti-PECAM/catalase also reduced alveolar edema and attenuated decline in arterial oxygen in mice that underwent unilateral lung ischemia/reperfusion, whereas anti-PECAM/SOD was not effective, implying the key role of H(2)O(2) in tissue damage in this pathology. In contrast, anti-PECAM/SOD, but not anti-PECAM/catalase prevented oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin and normalized vasoreactivity in the vessels of mice rendered hypertensive by pretreatment with angiotensin-II. This outcome agrees with reports implicating superoxide and peroxynitrite in altered endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in hypertension. Therefore, the use of endothelial cell-targeted antioxidants identifies the key specific species of ROS involved in various forms of vascular disease and holds promise for the mechanistically tailored treatment of these pathologies.",

The particular focus of these studies was the efficacy of EUK-189 when given after irradiation (mitigation).;We exposed whole or lower lungs of female Sprague-Dawley rats to doses ranging from 10 to 20.5 Gray (Gy) of (60)Co gamma rays. Animals in the EUK-189 treated groups received 2 or 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) at various times postirradiation (PI). A micronucleus assay was used to examine DNA damage at various times up to 16 weeks PI.;Our results indicated that EUK-189 administration after irradiation is effective at reducing micronucleus formation in lung fibroblasts at various times following radiation exposure. Treatment with EUK-189 in the first 3 days after thoracic irradiation did not, however, modify the dose required to cause severe morbidity at 2-3 months after irradiation.;The protection produced when Eukarion-189 was given shortly after irradiation suggests that DNA damage observed in the lung may be caused by chronic production of ROS induced by a chronic inflammatory response initiated by the radiation treatment. We speculate that our failure to observe protection against severe morbidity at 2-3 months may be because our treatment regime only blocked the initial wave of ROS production and that treatment needs to be more prolonged to suppress the effects of a chronic inflammatory response.",

SIRT3 is localized in the mitochondria, where it deacetylates and activates several enzymes involved in cellular redox balance and defense against oxidative damage.;We found that compared with normal human oral keratinocytes (HOK), SIRT3 is highly expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines, but the enzymatic deacetylation is significantly reduced. We also sequenced the entire coding region of SIRT3 and found the same mutation in 2 different OSCC cell lines. This point mutation is located in close proximity to the active site of deacetylase in the SIRT3 protein, and reduces the overall enzymatic efficiency of deacetylation. Furthermore, up-regulation of SIRT3 inhibited the cell growth of OSCCs and decreased the levels of basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both OSCC lines. To verify that the SIRT3 sequence variation was associated with oral carcinogenesis, we sequenced the SIRT3 gene from 21 OSCC patients, and 5 of the 21 patients (23.8%) carried the heterozygous missense mutation, p.Val208Ile. The heterozygous missense mutation in these patients was present in gremlin DNA isolated from both normal and tumor tissues.;Our findings provide a valuable insight into the potential role of SIRT3 in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, by showing that a non-synonymous point mutation in SIRT3 contributes to reduced catalytic activity of the protein and affects redox balance in OSCCs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Neutrophil release of NO/ONOO- induces endothelial cell barrier dysfunction in inflammatory acute lung injury (ALI). Previous studies using zymosan-triggered inflammation and ALI model revealed that zymosan promotes inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression in neutrophils, and that isoflurane inhibits zymosan-induced oxidative stress and iNOS biosynthesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We found here that in zymosan-primed neutrophils, iNOS is transcriptionally activated by NF-κB, whose nuclear translocation is triggered by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequently activated p38 MAPK. ROS production is attributed to zymosan-initiated Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling, in which the adaptor MyD88 recruits and activates c-Src, and c-Src activates NADPH oxidase to generate ROS. Subanesthetic isoflurane counteracts the aforementioned zymosan-induced signaling by targeting N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptor and thereby suppressing calcium influx and c-Src activation. Whereas iNOS accelerates NO/ONOO- production in neutrophils which eventually promote protein leak from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC), isoflurane reduced NO/ONOO- release from zymosan-treated neutrophils, and thus relieves trans-PMVEC protein leak. This study provides novel insights into the roles of neutrophils and the underlying mechanisms in zymosan-induced ALI, and has implications for the therapeutic potential of subanesthetic isoflurane in attenuating inflammatory responses causing lung endothelial cell damage.

Because NF-kappaB plays a central role in carcinogenesis, we examined the mechanism of mROS-mediated NF-kappaB activation and the fate of cancer cells during hypoxia after mitochondrial reduced glutathione (mGSH) depletion. Hypoxia generated mROS in hepatoma (HepG2, H35), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and colon carcinoma (DLD-1) cells, leading to hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha-dependent gene expression and c-Src activation that was prevented in cells expressing a redox-insensitive c-Src mutant (C487A). c-Src stimulation activated NF-kappaB without IkappaB-alpha degradation due to IkappaB-alpha tyrosine phosphorylation that was inhibited by rotenone/TTFA or c-Src antagonism. The c-Src-NF-kappaB signaling contributed to the survival of cells during hypoxia as c-Src inhibition or p65 down-regulation by small interfering RNA-sensitized HepG2 cells to hypoxia-induced cell death. Moreover, selective mGSH depletion resulted in an accelerated and enhanced mROS generation by hypoxia that killed SH-SY5Y and DLD-1 cells without disabling the c-Src-NF-kappaB pathway. Thus, although mROS promote cell survival by NF-kappaB activation via c-Src, mROS overgeneration may be exploited to sensitize cancer cells to hypoxia.",

To define the region, the upright lung was divided into four equal sampling areas dorsally along the paravertebral space. The Kubicek formula was used to calculate pulmonary perfusion. Regional base resistance (Ro) decreased from the top to about 3/4 down the lung and then leveled off. The regional perfusion (Qz) showed an increase from the apex to about 3/4 down the lung and thereafter decreased toward the base, except at TLC. The regional distribution of the electrical derivative of resistance (dR/dt) resembled that of Qz because there was no statistically significant difference in ventricular ejection time or heart rate among studies. The value of the arithmetic sum of regional Ro was significantly larger than that of Ro for the total sampling field while the reverse was true for Qz. These discrepancies can be explained on the basis of the lead field theory applied to IPG. The regional perfusion gradient determined by IPG represents the pulsatile perfusion gradient in vivo because the outputs from the impedance analyzer are intimately linked to the pulse-synchronous pulsatile nature of pulmonary blood flow. Safe, simple, and noninvasive IPG can be used to study regional pulmonary perfusion in clinical situations, high altitude, or unusual environments.",

Lung contusion is also a risk factor for the development of pneumonia, severe clinical acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Infiltrating neutrophils are considered to be central mediators of lung injuries after blunt trauma. Recent studies have demonstrated that antioxidants reduced pulmonary inflammation in different models of lung damage. This study examined the effect of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) on the progression of lung inflammation after exposure to a moderate level of blast overpressure (140 kPa). Rats were administered with NACA (i.p. 100 mg/kg) or placebo (PBS) 30, 60 min and 24 h after exposure. Nonblasted sham-injected animals served as controls. Neutrophil infiltration measured by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung was significantly increased at 2 days after blast and returned to controls at 8 days. This increase corresponded with activation of integrin CD11b mRNA and lung inflammatory chemokine mRNA expression; macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1), monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 (MCP-1), and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1). At 8 days, all inflammatory mediators returned to control levels. In addition, expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA increased at 2 days after exposure. No changes were detected in the lung manganase superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) or glutathione reductase (GR) mRNA expression after blast. N-Acetylcysteine amide significantly reduced infiltration of neutrophils and CD11b mRNA activation in lungs, and completely blocked activation of MIP-1, MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA. The relatively higher inhibition of chemokine mRNAs compared with reduction in MPO activity and CD11b is in accordance with an antioxidant effect of NACA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, rather than by an effect on neutrophil sequestration. The inhibition of HO-1 mRNA activation after blast was likely also related to the drug antioxidant effect.",

The reaction with NADPH is dramatically accelerated by various oxido-reductases including thioredoxin reductase. In vitro studies with various cancer cell lines have shown an increase in ROS and intracellular free zinc in cells treated with MGd. MGd increases cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and various chemotherapy agents and may be directly cytotoxic to tumor cells under certain conditions. MGd selectively localizes in tumors, perhaps due to their metabolic perturbations. MGd treatment in murine models enhances tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy agents. In controlled, randomized clinical trials, combining MGd treatment with ionizing radiation improves time to neurologic progression in lung cancer patients with brain metastases.

Purified HSA from LC patients (LC-HSA) contained higher levels of carbonyls than did HSA from healthy subjects (normal-HSA; P<0.01). LC-HSA was conformationally altered and showed greater exposure of its hydrophobic regions. Collectively, the oxidation of plasma proteins, especially HSA, might enhance oxidative stress in LC patients.",

Despite the fact that metastatic disease results in death in the majority of bladder cancer cases, the molecular events regulating the invasive phenotype of aggressive bladder cancer are not well understood. In this study, immunohistochemical examination showed that the leukotriene B(4) receptor BLT2 is overexpressed in advanced malignant bladder cancers (human transitional cell carcinomas) in proportion to advancing stages, with high prognostic significance (p<0.001). Blockade of BLT2 with the specific antagonist LY255283 or siRNA knockdown significantly suppressed the invasiveness of highly aggressive 253J-BV bladder cancer cells. Moreover, our results demonstrated that BLT2 mediates invasiveness through a signaling pathway dependent on NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox) 1- and Nox4-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent NF-kappaB stimulation. Metastasis of 253J-BV cells in mice was also dramatically suppressed by inhibition of BLT2 or its signaling. These findings suggest that a BLT2-Nox-ROS-NF-kappaB cascade plays a critical role in bladder cancer invasion and metastasis.",

Biological results suggested that the induction of G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and cell death by 9 may associate with increased expression of p21 and cyclin B1, elevation of Bax and p53 levels, and generation of ROS in the cell.

Antioxidation has been considered as an efficient treatment. Besides, liposomes are widely investigated as potential drug carriers due to their ability to protect and carry drug molecules to the target organ such as the lung. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether dipyridamole (DIP), delivered as a liposomal preparation, can ameliorate the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI due to the changes of its biodistribution. First, the liposomes entrapping DIP were prepared by film hydration for treating ARDS. Subsequently, the characterizations including entrapment efficiency, size, span and micrograph of DIP liposomes were measured. The concentration change of DIP in tissues and plasma of mice after intravenous administration of DIP injection and DIP liposomes was determined by RP-HPLC and calculated to lung targeting parameters. To prove the therapeutic efficiency, the effects of DIP liposomes on LPS-induced ALI were studied compared with DIP injection. The results showed DIP liposomes have the relative high entrapment efficiency and satisfying particle size. Compared with DIP injection, the liposomes increased the accumulation of DIP in the lung on a vast scale. Furthermore, DIP liposomes alleviated the ALI induced by LPS significantly.

The cytotoxic effect of GOS was mediated by its induction of apoptosis as characterized by the occurrence of DNA ladders, apoptotic bodies and chromosome condensation in both COLO205 and HT29 cells. Activation of caspase 3, 6, 8 and 9, but not caspase 1, accompanied by the appearance of cleaved fragments of PARP (85 kDa), and caspase 3 (p17/p15), was identified in GOS-treated cells. Decreases in Bcl-xL and phosphorylated Bad proteins were found in GOS-treated cells. GOS induction of ROS production was detected by in vitro plasmid digestion, and an increase in the intracellular peroxide level was observed in GOS-treated COLO205 cells by the DCHF-DA assay. Antioxidants including N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), catalase (CAT), tempol (TEM) and melatonin (MEL), but not allopurinol (ALL), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or diphenylene iodonium (DPI), significantly inhibited GOS-induced Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through blocking the occurrence of apoptosis. GOS induced mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by a loss of the mitochondria membrane potential via DiOC6 staining, and the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the cytoplasm was observed. Removing mitochondria by ethidium bromide (EtBr) treatment significantly reduced the apoptotic effect of GOS in COLO205 cells. Furthermore, an intraperitoneal injection of GOS or gossypol acetic acid (GAA) significantly reduced the growth of colorectal carcinoma induced by a subcutaneous injection of COLO205 cells in nude mice.

In this study we observed that alpha-hederin caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis of murine leukemia P388 cells. In order to evaluate the possible mechanisms for apoptosis, the effects of alpha-hederin on intracellular thiol concentration, including reduced glutathione (GSH), and protein thiols, and the effects of pretreatment with N-acetlycysteine (NAC), a precursor of intracellular GSH synthesis, or buthionine sulfoxime (BSO), a specific inhibitor of intracellular GSH synthesis, on alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis were investigated. It was found that alpha-hederin rapidly depleted intracellular GSH and protein thiols prior to the occurrence of apoptosis. NAC significantly alleviated alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis, while BSO augmented alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis significantly. The depletion of cellular thiols observed after alpha-hederin treatment caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) and subsequently increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in P388 cells at an early time point. Bongkrekic acid (BA), a ligand of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator, and cyclosporin (CsA) attenuated the alpha-hederin-induced loss of deltapsi(m), and ROS production. Thus, oxidative stress after alpha-hederin treatment is an important event in alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis. As observed in this study, permeability transition of mitochondrial membrane occurs after depletion of GSH and precedes a state of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, we observed that alpha-hederin caused the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol, leading to caspase-3 activation. Our findings thus demonstrate that changes in intracellular thiols and redox status leading to perturbance of mitochondrial functions are important components in the mechanism of alpha-hederin-induced cell death.",

Thioredoxin (Trx) is an antioxidant that prevents oxidative stress-induced cell death, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The aim of this study was to determine the role of Trx in the pathogenesis of hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury. Alveolar type II epithelial cells from fetal rat lung were exposed to hyperoxia in vitro in the presence or absence of recombinant human Trx (rhTrx 2 µg/ml). Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Apoptosis and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathways were detected by Western blotting. We also investigated the effects of rhTrx on the following antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase). Trx significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced cell death and increased cell viability. In addition, ROS generation in type II cells was inhibited by rhTrx under hyperoxic conditions. We demonstrated that rhTrx protected type II cells against hyperoxic injury via sustaining the extracellular signal regulated kinase and PI3K activation, and decreasing of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase and p38 activation. The results also showed manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were increased by rhTrx in type II cells exposed to hyperoxia.Taken together, these results demonstrate that rhTrx administration markedly attenuates hyperoxia-induced type II cell injury through reduction of ROS generation, elevation of antioxidant activities and regulation of both MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.",

The comparative expression of one of the identified genes, RAS homolog enriched in the brain (RHEB), was further explored using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Microarray analysis was performed on tissue samples from five patients with fibroadenoma. In the fibroadenoma samples, the genes HDAC1, ROS1, TNFRSF10A, WASP2, TYRP1, WEE1, and RHEB were expressed at levels more than twofold higher than in the normal tissues. RT-PCR for RHEB indicated increased expression of RHEB in fibroadenoma compared to breast cancer. When studied with real-time PCR, the average RHEB/beta-actin ratio in fibroadenoma samples was 1.99, 2.46-fold greater than the average RHEB/beta-actin ratio in breast carcinoma of 0.81 (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemistry and PCR followed by microdissection shows increased expression of RHEB in epithelial cells compared to the stromal cells of fibroadenoma. Therefore, RHEB could be used cytopathologically to distinguish fibroadenoma from malignant breast carcinomas as a secondary diagnostic tool.",

Pulmonary ischemia studied with the isolated murine lung or flow adapted pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in vitro results in endothelial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO. The response requires caveolae and is initiated by endothelial cell depolarization via K(ATP) channel closure followed by activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX2) and NO synthase (eNOS), signaling through MAP kinases, and endothelial cell proliferation.

Compared with tanshinone IIA, TDT showed more cytotoxic effects on the 95D cells. Annexin V/7-AAD double staining, the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (Δψ), the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as cleaved-PARP, cleaved-caspase-3, Bax, and Bad, and the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were evidence of TDT-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, TDT-induced autophagy as demonstrated by monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and the up-regulation of autophagy-associated proteins, such as LC3-II, Beclin-1, Atg3, Atg5, Atg7, and Atg12. Autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and bafilomycin A1, enhanced TDT-induced cell death. 3-MA pretreatment enhanced the TDT-induced up-regulation of Bax and cleaved-PARP. In addition, TDT induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was reversed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC also reversed TDT-induced depolarization of Δψ, MDC staining, up-regulation of Bax, cleaved-PARP, Beclin-1, LC3-II, and cell viability.

Increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lungs of such patients are reflected by elevated concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the breath, airways, lung tissue and blood. Traditionally, the measurement of these biomarkers has involved invasive procedures to procure the samples or to examine the affected compartments, to the patient's discomfort. As a consequence, there is a need for less or non-invasive approaches to measure oxidative stress. The collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has recently emerged as a non-invasive sampling method for real-time analysis and evaluation of oxidative stress biomarkers in the lower respiratory tract airways. The biomarkers of oxidative stress such as H2O2, F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, antioxidants, glutathione and nitrosative stress such as nitrate/nitrite and nitrosated species have been successfully measured in EBC. The reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity of the methodologies used in the measurements of EBC oxidative stress biomarkers are discussed. Oxidative stress biomarkers also have been measured for various antioxidants in disease prognosis. EBC is currently used as a research and diagnostic tool in free radical research, yielding information on redox disturbance and the degree and type of inflammation in the lung.

        "Doc_abstract":"The molecular and cellular basis of inflammation has become a topic of great interest of late because of the association between mechanisms of inflammation and risk for cancer. Inflammatory-mediated events, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activation of growth factors (for wound repair), and the altering of signal-transduction processes to activate cell-proliferation (to replace necrotic/apoptotic tissue cells), events that also can occur independently of inflammation, are all considered to be components of risk for a variety of cancers. Using scar cancer of the lung as an example, mechanisms of inflammation associated with recurring infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis are discussed in the context that they may, in fact, be the major or sole cause of a cancer. Production of ROS, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines in pulmonary tissues is greatly enhanced due to a cell-mediated immune response against macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis. These responses lead to the extensive fibrosis associated with recurring infections, possibly leading to decreased clearance of lymph and lymph-associated particles from the infected region. They also will enhance rates of cell division by inhibiting synthesis of P21, leading to enhanced progression from G0 arrest to G1 phase, from G1 to Sphase, and from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. By increasing rates of oxidative DNA damage and inhibiting apoptosis by enhancing synthesis of BCL-2, mutagenesis of progeny cells is enhanced, and these effects coupled with enhanced angiogenesis stimulated by COX-2 products lead to an environment that is highly conducive to tumorigenesis. Based on the evidence, it appears that but for an inflammatory response to recurring infections, some cases of scar cancer would not exist. By making appropriate lifestyle and dietary changes, a variety of anti-inflammatory effects can be produced, which should attenuate inflammation-induced risk for cancer.",

Here we report that HB-EGF can be exported from the nucleus during stimulated processing and secretion of the growth factor. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulted in mobilization of the HB-EGF precursor, proHB-EGF, from the nucleus of TCCSUP bladder cancer cells to a detergent-resistant membrane compartment, where the growth factor was cleaved by a metalloproteinase-mediated mechanism and shed into the extracellular space. Inhibition of nuclear export suppressed HB-EGF shedding. Production of ROS resulted in EGF receptor (EGFR) and Akt1 phosphorylation in HB-EGF-expressing cells. HB-EGF also stimulated cell proliferation and conferred cytoprotection when cells were challenged with cisplatin. These findings show that the nucleus can serve as an intracellular reservoir for a secreted EGFR ligand and, thus, can contribute to an autocrine loop leading to cell proliferation and protection from apoptotic stimuli.",

Although it has been logically hypothesized that NF-kappaB is a major target of PS-341, the underlying mechanism by which PS-341 inhibits tumor cell growth is unclear. Here we found that PS-341 potently activated the caspase cascade and induced apoptosis in human HNSCC cell lines. Although PS-341 could inhibit NF-kappaB activation, the inhibition of NF-kappaB was not sufficient to initiate apoptosis in HNSCC cells. Using biochemical and microarray approaches, we found that proteasome inhibition by PS-341 induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HNSCC cells. The inhibition of ROS significantly suppressed caspase activation and apoptosis induced by PS-341. Consistently, PS-341 could not induce the ER stress-ROS in PS-341-resistant HNSCC cells. Taken together, our results suggest that in addition to the abolishment of the prosurvival NF-kappaB, PS-341 might directly induce apoptosis by activating proapoptotic ER stress-ROS signaling cascades in HNSCC cells, providing novel insights into the PS-341-mediated antitumor activity.",

The present study investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt in fibrogenesis of human lung fibroblasts and its regulation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Exposure of lung fibroblasts to bleomycin, a known inducer of fibrosis, resulted in rapid activation of PI3K/Akt and a parallel increase in fibroblast proliferation and collagen production, characteristics of lung fibrosis. Bleomycin had no significant effect on total Akt protein expression but induced phosphorylation of the protein at threonine 308 and serine 473 positions. Inhibition of this phosphorylation by PI3K inhibitors or by dominant-negative Akt (T308A/S473A) expression abrogated the effects of bleomycin on fibroblast proliferation and collagen production, suggesting the role of PI3K/Akt in the fibrogenic process. Activation of PI3K/Akt by bleomycin also led to transcriptional activation and protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor, which contributed to the fibroproliferative and collagen-inducing effects of bleomycin. The fibrogenic effects of bleomycin were dependent on ROS generation, particularly superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, which were induced by bleomycin. Inhibition of ROS generation by antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTBAP, abrogated the fibrogenic effects of bleomycin as well as its induction of PI3K/Akt and HIF-1alpha activation. Together, our results indicate a novel role of PI3K/Akt in fibrogenesis of human lung fibroblasts and its regulation by ROS, which could be exploited for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and related disorders.",

We initially generated radioresistant laryngeal cancer cell lines from human HEp-2 cells with fractionated radiation. These RR-HEp-2 cells and isolated clones displayed more radioresistant and anti-apoptotic phenotypes than parental HEp-2 cells after radiation. Characteristics of RR-Hep-2 cell lines were confirmed by upregulation of radioresistance-related genes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, Hsp90, and Bcl-xl. Subsequently, we examined proteome changes between HEp-2 and RR-HEp-2 cells and identified 16 proteins showing significantly altered expression levels. Interestingly, protein expression of chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) was markedly suppressed in RR-HEp-2 cells, compared with non-irradiated control cells. Suppression of CLIC1 with an indanyloxyacetic acid-94 or small interfering RNA led to radioresistance in HEp-2 cells by suppressing the radiation-induced cellular ROS level. However, ectopic overexpression of CLIC1 induced radiosensitivity in RR-HEp-2 cells via induction of ROS level after radiation, suggesting that the protein acts as a positive regulator of ROS production. Our results collectively indicate that suppression of CLIC1 contributes to acquisition of the radioresistance phenotype of laryngeal cancer cells via inhibition of ROS production, implying that this protein is an important candidate molecule for radiotherapy in radioresistant laryngeal cancer cells.",

Here, we further investigated the mechanism involved in the apoptotic process in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (ASTC-a-1) at a laser irradiation fluence of 120 J/cm(2) (633 nm). Cytochrome c release was ascribed to mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) because the release was prevented by cyclosporine (CsA), a specific inhibitor of MPT. Furthermore, mitochondrial permeability for calcein (approximately 620 Da) was another evidence for the MPT induction under HF-LPLI treatment. A high-level intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was observed after irradiation. The photodynamically produced ROS caused onset of MPT, as the ROS scavenger docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevented the MPT. However, CsA failed to prevented cell death induced by HF-LPLI, indicating the existence of other signaling pathways. Following laser irradiation, Bax activation occurred after mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release, indicating Bax activation was a downstream event. In the presence of CsA, Bax was still activated at the end-stage of apoptotic process caused by HF-LPLI, suggesting that Bax was involved in an alternative-signaling pathway, which was independent of MPT. Under HF-LPLI treatment, cell viabilities due to pre-treatment with DHA, CsA, or Bax small interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that the MPT signaling pathway was dominant, while Bax signaling pathway was secondary, and more importantly ROS mediated both pathways. Taken together, these results showed that HF-LPLI induced cell apoptosis via the CsA-sensitive MPT, which was ROS-dependent. Furthermore, there existed a secondary signaling pathway through Bax activation. The observed link between MPT and triggering ROS could be a fundamental phenomenon in HF-LPLI-induced cell apoptosis.",

With alveolar macrophages (AM) being the main line of defense in lung environments, the influence of free heme on AM activity and function was investigated. We observed that heme in a concentration range found during hemolytic episodes (3-30 μM) elicits AM to present a proinflammatory profile, stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) generation and inducing IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion. ROS production is NADPH oxidase-dependent, being inhibited by DPI and apocynin, and involves p47 subunit phosphorylation. Furthermore, heme induces NF- κB nuclear translocation, iNOS, and also HO-1 expression. Moreover, AM stimulated with free heme show enhanced phagocytic and bactericidal activities. Taken together, the data support a dual role for heme in the inflammatory response associated with lung hemorrhage, acting as a proinflammatory molecule that can either act as both an adjuvant of the innate immunity and as an amplifier of the inflammatory response, leading tissue injury. The understanding of heme effects on pulmonary inflammatory processes can lead to the development of new strategies to ameliorate tissue damage associated with hemorrhagic episodes.",

The alveolar epithelium is composed of type-I and type-II epithelial cells (ATI and ATII respectively) and is bathed in pulmonary surfactant. The effect of native human ATII cell secretions on nanoparticle toxicity is not known. We investigated the cellular uptake and toxicity of silver nanowires (AgNWs; 70 nm diameter, 1.5 μm length) with human ATI-like cells (TT1), in the absence or presence of Curosurf® (a natural porcine pulmonary surfactant with a low amount of protein) or harvested primary human ATII cell secretions (HAS; containing both the complete lipid as well as the full protein complement of human pulmonary surfactant i.e. SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D). We hypothesised that Curosurf® or HAS would confer improved protection for TT1 cells, limiting the toxicity of AgNWs. In agreement with our hypothesis, HAS reduced the inflammatory and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating potential of AgNWs with exposed TT1 cells. For example, IL-8 release and ROS generation was reduced by 38% and 29%, respectively, resulting in similar levels to that of the non-treated controls. However in contrast to our hypothesis, Curosurf® had no effect. We found a significant reduction in AgNW uptake by TT1 cells in the presence of HAS but not Curosurf. Furthermore, we show that the SP-A and SP-D are likely to be involved in this process as they were found to be specifically bound to the AgNWs. While ATI cells appear to be protected by HAS, evidence suggested that ATII cells, despite no uptake, were vulnerable to AgNW exposure (indicated by increased IL-8 release and ROS generation and decreased intracellular SP-A levels one day post-exposure).

In this study, we examined whether the stress-activated protein kinase p38α (Mapk14) controls ROS metabolism and development of fibrosis and cancer in mice given thioacetamide to induce chronic liver injury. Liver-specific p38α ablation was found to enhance ROS accumulation, which appears to be exerted through the reduced expression of antioxidant protein HSP25 (Hspb1), a mouse homolog of HSP27. Its reexpression in p38α-deficient liver prevents ROS accumulation and thioacetamide-induced fibrosis. p38α deficiency increased expression of SOX2, a marker for cancer stem cells and the liver oncoproteins c-Jun (Jun) and Gankyrin (Psmd10) and led to enhanced thioacetamide-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. The upregulation of SOX2 and c-Jun was prevented by administration of the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole. Intriguingly, the risk of human HCC recurrence is positively correlated with ROS accumulation in liver. Thus, p38α and its target HSP25/HSP27 appear to play a conserved and critical hepatoprotective function by curtailing ROS accumulation in liver parenchymal cells engaged in oxidative metabolism of exogenous chemicals.

To test this hypothesis, we examined vasodilatory and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) Ca2+ responses to the NO donor spermine NONOate in UTP-constricted, isolated pressurized small pulmonary arteries from control and CH rats. Consistent with our previous findings in perfused lungs, we observed attenuated NO-dependent vasodilation following CH in endothelium-intact vessels.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) is a powerful inducer of myofibroblast differentiation and is implicated in pathogenensis of tissue fibrosis. This study was undertaken to determine the role of mitochondrial deacetylase, SIRT3 in TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiqtion in vitro and lung fibrosis in vivo. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts with TGFβ1 resulted in increased expression of fibrosis markers, smooth muscle alpha-actin (α-SMA), collagen-1 and fibronectin. TGF-β1 treatment also caused depletion of endogenous SIRT3, which paralleled with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and subsequent reduction in levels of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), an enzyme that hydrolyzes oxidized-guanine (8-Oxo-dG), and thus protects DNA from oxidative damage. Overexpression of SIRT3 by adenovirus-mediated transduction reversed the effects of TGF-β1 on ROS production and mitochondrial DNA damage, and inhibited TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation. To determine the anti-fibrotic role of SIRT3 in vivo, we used the bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. Compared to wild-type controls, SIRT3-KO mice showed exacerbated fibrosis after intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. Increased lung fibrosis was associated with decreased levels of OGG1 and concomitant accumulation of 8-Oxo-dG and increased mitochondrial DNA damage. In contrast, the transgenic mice with whole body SIRT3 overexpression were protected from bleomycin-induced mtDNA damage and development of lung fibrosis. These data demonstrate a critical role of SIRT3 in the control of myofibroblast differentiation and lung fibrosis.",

SARS-CoV PLpro dose- and time-dependently up-regulates TGF-β1 and vimentin in A549 cells. Dual luciferase reporter assays with TGF-β1 promoter plasmids indicated that TGF-β1 promoter region between -175 to -60, the Egr-1 binding site, was responsible for TGF-β1 promoter activation induced by SARS-CoV PLpro. Subcellular localization analysis of transcription factors showed PLpro triggering nuclear translocation of Egr-1, but not NF-κB and Sp-1. Meanwhile, Egr-1 silencing by siRNA significantly reduced PLpro-induced up-regulation of TGF-β1, TSP-1 and pro-fibrotic genes. Furthermore, the inhibitors for ROS (YCG063), p38 MAPK (SB203580), and STAT3 (Stattic) revealed ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway involving in Egr-1 dependent activation of TGF-β1 promoter induced by PLpro.

In addition, DATS inhibited the production of serum nitric oxide NO and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the lungs of Kunming mice.

In order to explain this it has been suggested that at high serum levels of beta-carotene, prooxidant characteristics of beta-carotene may become manifest, yielding reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducing oxidative DNA damage. It has further been hypothesized that cigarette smoke carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and/or B[a]P metabolites, may directly react with beta-carotene. Furthermore, beta-carotene oxidation products may have a role in the bioactivation of B[a]P analogous to the peroxide shunt pathway of cytochrome P450 supported by cumene hydroperoxide. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of beta-carotene on the formation of B[a]P-DNA adducts and oxidative DNA damage in vitro in isolated DNA, applying as metabolizing systems rat liver and lung metabolizing fractions and lung metabolizing fractions from smoking and non-smoking humans. We established that beta-carotene in the presence of various metabolizing systems was unable to induce oxidative DNA damage (8-oxo-dG), although beta-carotene is capable of generating ROS spontaneously in the absence of metabolizing fractions. We also could not find an effect of beta-carotene on DNA adduct formation induced by B[a]P upon metabolic activation.

To accomplish this, female BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA), and examined for the following typical asthmatic reactions: increased numbers of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); production of Th1 cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in BALF); production of Th2 cytokines (such as interleukin IL-4 and IL-5) in BALF; presence of total and OVA-specific immunoglobulins (Ig)E in serum; presence of oxidative stress; hyperplasia of goblet cells in the lung; and marked influx of inflammatory cells into the lung. Our results collectively show that schizandrin exerts profound inhibitory effects on accumulation of eosinophils into the airways and reduces the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IFN-γ, and TNF-α in BALF. Additionally, schizandrin suppresses the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibits goblet cell hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue. Thus, schizandrin has anti-asthmatic effects, which seem to be partially mediated by reduction of oxidative stress and airway inflammation, in a murine allergic asthma model.

We previously reported that high concentrations of tetrandrine induce apoptosis in liver cancer cells. Here, we found that in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, a low dose of tetrandrine (5 μm) induced the expression of LC3-II, resulted in the formation of acidic autophagolysosome vacuoles (AVOs), and caused a punctate fluorescence pattern with the GFP-LC3 protein, which all are markers for cellular autophagy. Tetrandrine induced the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and treatment with ROS scavengers significantly abrogated the tetrandrine-induced autophagy. These results suggest that the generation of ROS plays an important role in promoting tetrandrine-induced autophagy. Tetrandrine-induced mitochondrial dysfunction resulted in ROS accumulation and autophagy. ROS generation activated the ERK MAP kinase, and the ERK signaling pathway at least partially contributed to tetrandrine-induced autophagy in HCC cells. Moreover, we found that tetrandrine transcriptionally regulated the expression of autophagy related gene 7 (ATG7), which promoted tetrandrine-induced autophagy. In addition to in vitro studies, similar results were also observed in vivo, where tetrandrine caused the accumulation of ROS and induced cell autophagy in a tumor xenograft model. Interestingly, tetrandrine treatment also induced autophagy in a ROS-dependent manner in C. elegans muscle cells. Therefore, these findings suggest that tetrandrine is a potent autophagy agonist and may be a promising clinical chemotherapeutic agent.",

In mouse lung epithelial cells that express Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, p22(phox), p47(phox), p67(phox), and Noxo1, overexpression of Nox1 delayed cell cycle withdrawal by maintaining AP-1-dependent expression of cyclin D1 in low serum conditions. In cycling cells, the effects of Nox1 were dose dependent: levels of Nox1 that induced 3- to 10-fold increases in ROS promoted phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and expression of cyclin D1, whereas expression of Nox1 with Noxo1 and Noxa1 (or expression of Nox4 alone) that induced substantial increases in intracellular ROS inhibited cyclin D1 and proliferation. Catalase reversed the effects of Nox1 on cyclin D1 and cell proliferation. Diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase activity, did not affect dosedependent responses of ERK1/2 or Akt to serum, but markedly inhibited the sequential expression of c-Fos and Fra-1 required for induction of cyclin D1 during cell cycle re-entry. These results indicate that Nox1 stimulates cell proliferation in actively cycling cells by reducing the requirement for growth factors to maintain expression of cyclin D1, whereas during cell cycle re-entry, NADPH oxidase activity is required for transcriptional activation of Fos family genes during the immediate early gene response.",

In this study, human ESCC cell line SHEEC and parental normal cell line SHEE were used. The anti-tumor effect of PDT was determined by evaluating cell viability using CCK-8 assay, apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PDT induced significant apoptosis in SHEEC and SHEE cells in a time- and photofrin-II dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PDT treatment induced significant death of SHEEC, instead of SHEE cells. The apoptotic outcome was accompanied by concurrent generation of ROS.

The regulation of the TGF-beta family of growth factors is unique because they are targeted to the extracellular matrix in a biologically inactive form. The release from pericellular matrices and the activation of TGF-beta are important mechanisms in several pathophysiologic conditions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate TGF-beta either directly or indirectly via the activation of proteases. In addition, TGF-beta itself induces ROS production as part of its signal-transduction pathway. The lung is a unique organ, because its structures act as boundaries between gaseous and aqueous phases, allowing the utilization of inhaled oxygen. However, this renders pulmonary tissues vulnerable to the toxic effects of inhaled air. The oxidant pathways are especially relevant in the lung, where TGF-beta is known to have a role in tissue repair and connective tissue turnover. In pulmonary fibrosis, TGF-beta activation is considered as a hallmark of disease progression. More recently, the oxidative effects of cigarette smoking have been found to activate TGF-beta in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease consisting of emphysema, airway fibrosis, and focal lung fibrosis.",

The surface of 1HTO was smooth, and the surface of 2HTO was much rougher. The negative charge on the surface increased in the order of 2HTO, 3HTO, and 1HTO, whereas the surface area increased in the order of 3HTO, 1HTO, and 2HTO. The lung is a main exposure route of nanoparticles. On day 28 after a single instillation (1 mg/kg), three nanowires induced a Th2-type inflammatory response together with the relative increase in CD4⁺ T cells, especially by 2HTO. In vitro, three TiO₂ nanowires (10 μg/ml) commonly induced the generation of cell debris in eight cell lines which may be the potential target organ of nanoparticles, especially by 2HTO. It seemed that the generation of cell debris coincides with the increase in autophagosome-like vacuoles in the cytosol. In further study using BEAS-2B cells originated from the lung, the protein amount from cells exposed to 2HTO decreased more clearly although the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was less compared to 1HTO and 3HTO. Based on these results, we suggest that surface area may act as an important factor depends on the biological response by TiO₂ nanowires.

We tried to optimize PDT using the light-activated (320-400 nm) St John's Wort-derived compound, Hyp (hypericin). The work highlights the potential mode of cell death and the increased efficacy of the technique associated with multiple Hyp-PDT treatment. SCC cells were exposed to different concentrations of Hyp and activated with light at 1 J/cm2 for 1 or 2 days. Thereafter with the optimum dose of Hyp proliferation, ROS (reactive oxygen species), and apoptosis were analysed by XTT [2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] assay, FACS analysis and Fluorescent/Phase contrast microscopy was carried out for morphological studies.

Peat fires often produce larger amounts of smoke and last longer than forest fires, however few studies have reported on their toxicity. Moreover, reliable alternatives to traditional animal toxicity testing are needed to reduce the number of animals required for hazard identification and risk assessments.;Size-fractionated particulate matter (PM; ultrafine, fine, and coarse) were obtained from the peat fire while smoldering (ENCF-1) or when nearly extinguished (ENCF-4). Extracted samples were analyzed for chemical constituents and endotoxin content. Female CD-1 mice were exposed via oropharyngeal aspiration to 100 μg/mouse, and assessed for relative changes in lung and systemic markers of injury and inflammation. At 24 h post-exposure, hearts were removed for ex vivo functional assessments and ischemic challenge. Lastly, 8 mm diameter lung slices from CD-1 mice were exposed (11 μg) ± co-treatment of PM with polymyxin B (PMB), an endotoxin-binding compound.;On an equi-mass basis, coarse ENCF-1 PM had the highest endotoxin content and elicited the greatest pro-inflammatory responses in the mice including: increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and MIP-2), neutrophils and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Exposure to fine or ultrafine particles from either period failed to elicit significant lung or systemic effects. In contrast, mice exposed to ENCF-1 ultrafine PM developed significantly decreased cardiac function and greater post-ischemia-associated myocardial infarction. Finally, similar exposures to mouse lung slices induced comparable patterns of cytokine production; and these responses were significantly attenuated by PMB.;The findings suggest that exposure to coarse PM collected during a peat fire causes greater lung inflammation in association with endotoxin and ROS, whereas the ultrafine PM preferentially affected cardiac responses. In addition, lung tissue slices were shown to be a predictive, alternative assay to assess pro-inflammatory effects of PM of differing size and composition. Importantly, these toxicological findings were consistent with the cardiopulmonary health effects noted in epidemiologic reports from exposed populations.",

Regulators of ROS (i.e. antioxidants), alveolarization (i.e. matrix metalloproteinases - MMPs) and microvascular maturation (i.e. vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGF) are altered in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We tested the hypothesis that early treatment with MnTBAP, a superoxide dismutase mimetic and superoxide anion and peroxynitrite scavenger, alters lung biomarkers of angiogenesis and alveolarization during hyperoxia with intermittent hypoxia (IH) in neonatal rats. Neonatal rats were exposed to 50% O2 with brief IH episodes (12% O2) from P0 to P14, or to room air (RA). On P0, P1 & P2, the pups received a daily IP injection of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg MnTBAP, or saline. At P14, the pups were either euthanized, or allowed to recover in RA until P21. RA littermates were similarly treated. Lung VEGF, sVEGFR-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were determined. Low-dose MnTBAP (1 mg/kg) prevented the increase in lung VEGF induced by intermittent hypoxia noted in the control group. This dose was also effective for decreasing MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect for MnTBAP. IH decreased MMP-2 with no ameliorating effect by MnTBAP. Our data demonstrate that brief, repeated intermittent hypoxia during hyperoxia can alter biomarkers responsible for normal microvascular and alveolar development.

We postulated that Rtp801 is not only increased by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TS, but it is instrumental in creating a feedforward process leading to amplification of endogenous ROS generation. We used cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to model the effect of TS in wild type (Wt) and knockout (KO-Rtp801) mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF).

Both, superoxide production and increase in the cytoplasmic redox were inhibited by apocynin. Reduction of activity of Sod, and the decreases in expression of Sod2 and Gpx1 genes were associated with Rtp801 CSE-induction.

Chamaejasmine inhibited the growth of A549 cells in a time and dose-dependent manner. The IC₅₀ value was 7.72 µM after 72 h treatment. Chamaejasmine arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway. Western blot analysis showed that chamaejasmine inhibited Bcl-2 expression and induced Bax expression to desintegrate the outer mitochondrial membrane and causing cytochrome c release. Mitochondrial cytochrome c release was associated with the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 cascade, and active-caspase-3 was involved in PARP cleavage. All of these signal transduction pathways are involved in initiating apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the cytotoxic activity of chamaejasmine towards A549 in vitro.",

The objective of this study was to determine if (-)-deprenyl, an antioxidant with antiapoptotic properties, would attenuate HS-induced vascular hyperpermeability. In rats, HS was induced by withdrawing blood to reduce the MAP to 40 mmHg for 60 min followed by resuscitation for 60 min. To study hyperpermeability, we injected the rats with fluorescein isothiocyanate--albumin (50 mg/kg), and the changes in integrated optical intensity of the mesenteric postcapillary venules were obtained intravascularly and extravascularly using intravital microscopy. Mitochondrial ROS formation and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) were studied using dihydrorhodamine 123 and JC-1, respectively. Mitochondrial release of cytochrome c was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and caspase-3 activity by a fluorometric assay. Parallel studies were performed in rat lung microvascular endothelial cells using proapoptotic BAK as inducer of hyperpermeability. Hemorrhagic shock induced vascular hyperpermeability, mitochondrial ROS formation, DeltaPsim decrease, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation (P G 0.05). (-)-Deprenyl (0.15 mg/kg) attenuated all these effects (P < 0.05). Similarly in rat lung microvascular endothelial cells, (-)-deprenyl attenuated BAK peptide-induced monolayer hyperpermeability (P < 0.05), ROS formation, DeltaPsim decrease, cytochrome c release (P<0.05), and caspase-3 activation (P < 0.05). The protective effects of (-)-deprenyl on vascular barrier functions may be due to its protective effects on DeltaPsim, thereby preventing mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and caspase-3--mediated disruption of endothelial adherens junctions.",

Although the mechanisms of RSV-induced airway disease remain incompletely defined, the lung inflammatory response is thought to play a central pathogenetic role. In the past few years, we and others have provided increasing evidence of a role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as important regulators of RSV-induced cellular signaling leading to the expression of key proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines. In addition, RSV-induced oxidative stress, which results from an imbalance between ROS production and airway antioxidant defenses, due to a widespread inhibition of antioxidant enzyme expression, is likely to play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of RSV-associated lung inflammatory disease, as demonstrated by a significant increase in markers of oxidative injury, which correlate with the severity of clinical illness, in children with RSV infection. Modulation of ROS production and oxidative stress therefore represents a potential novel pharmacological approach to ameliorate RSV-induced lung inflammation and its long-term consequences.",

Flow cytometry and measurement of their caspase-3 activities revealed that knockdown of LYRM1 increased P19 cell apoptosis. Observation of morphological changes using an inverted microscope and expression analysis of specific differentiation marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that knockdown of LYRM1 significantly inhibited the differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR applied to detect mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number implied that there was no significant difference in the LYRM1 knockdown group compared with the control group. Cellular ATP production investigated by luciferase-based luminescence assay was dramatically decreased in differentiated cells transfected with LYRM1 RNAi. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometery were used to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) showed that the level of ROS was dramatically increased and MMP was obviously decreased in differentiated cells transfected with LYRM1 RNAi. Collectively, knockdown of LYRM1 promoted apoptosis and suppressed proliferation and differentiation in P19 cells.

Silica taken up by alveolar macrophages causes phagolysosomal membrane damage and leakage of lysosomal material into the cytoplasm to initiate apoptosis. We investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this membrane damage by studying the spatiotemporal generation of ROS. In macrophages, ROS generated by NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) was detected in phagolysosomes containing either silica particles or nontoxic latex particles. ROS was only detected in the cytoplasm of cells treated with silica and appeared in parallel with an increase in phagosomal ROS, as well as several hours later associated with mitochondrial production of ROS late in apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of NOX activity did not prevent silica-induced phagolysosomal leakage but delayed it. In Cos7 cells, which do not express NOX2, ROS was detected in silica-containing phagolysosomes that leaked. ROS was not detected in phagolysosomes containing latex particles. Leakage of silica-containing phagolysosomes in both cell types was transient, and after resealing of the membrane, endolysosomal fusion continued. These results demonstrate that silica particles can generate phagosomal ROS independent of NOX activity, and we propose that this silica-generated ROS can cause phagolysosomal leakage to initiate apoptosis.

Additional studies indicated that CA1P induced microtubule depolymerization-mediated AKT inactivation, which resulted in GSK-3β activation, Wnt/β-Catenin pathway inhibition, and Mcl-1 down-regulation. The induction of HepG2 cell apoptosis by CA1P was prevented by a GSK-3β-specific inhibitor.

CA1P induced TAM apoptosis in vitro through the same mechanism observed with HepG2 cells, and it eliminated TAMs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo. In TME, the expression of TGF-β and TNF-α was also altered. The adoptive transfer of macrophages partly rescued the growth of tumor inhibited by CA1P.

Loss of GSTP1 expression via promoter hypermethylation is the most common epigenetic alteration observed in human prostate cancer. Silencing of GSTP1 can increase generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage in cells. In this study we investigated whether loss of GSTP1 contributes to increased DNA damage that may predispose men to a higher risk of prostate cancer. We found significantly elevated (103%; P < 0.0001) levels of 8-oxo-2'-deoxogunosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative DNA damage marker, in adenocarcinomas, compared to benign counterparts, which positively correlated (r = 0.2) with loss of GSTP1 activity (34%; P < 0.0001). Silencing of GSTP1 using siRNA approach in normal human prostate epithelial RWPE1 cells caused increased intracellular production of ROS and higher susceptibility of cells to H2 O2 -mediated oxidative stress. Additionally, human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells, which contain a silenced GSTP1 gene, were genetically modified to constitutively express high levels of GSTP1. Induction of GSTP1 activity lowered endogenous ROS levels in LNCaP-pLPCX-GSTP1 cells, and when exposed to H2 O2 , these cells exhibited significantly reduced production of ROS and 8-OHdG levels, compared to vector control LNCaP-pLPCX cells. Furthermore, exposure of LNCaP cells to green tea polyphenols caused reexpression of GSTP1, which protected the cells from H2 O2 -mediated DNA damage through decreased ROS production compared to nonexposed cells. These results suggest that loss of GSTP1 expression in human prostate cells, a process that increases their susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, may be an important target for primary prevention of prostate cancer.",

Hepatocyte-targeted delivery of catalase was successfully achieved by galactosylation, which was highly effective in inhibiting the hepatic metastasis of colon26 cells. PEGylation, which increased the retention of catalase in the circulation, effectively inhibited the pulmonary metastasis of the cells. To examine which processes in tumor metastasis are inhibited by catalase derivatives, the tissue distribution and proliferation of tumor cells in mice was quantitatively analyzed using firefly luciferase-expressing tumor cells. An injection of PEG-catalase just before the inoculation of melanoma B16-BL6/Luc cells significantly reduced the number of the tumor cells in the lung at 24 h. Daily dosing of PEG-catalase greatly inhibited the proliferation of the tumor cells, and increased the survival rate of the tumor-bearing mice.

In tumor-bearing mice, low-dose simvastatin (0.2 mg/kg) induced upregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) skewed vessels to a pericyte-coated and stable pattern, while high-dose simvastatin (10 mg/kg) remarkably deceased reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, attenuating VEGF-drived tumor vessel hyperpermeability. These changes ultimately improved intratumoral perfusion and decreased tumor hypoxia. Administration of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide to the simvastatin-treated mice resulted in slower tumor growth.

        "Doc_abstract":"Patients with acute lung injury develop hypoxia, which may lead to lung dysfunction and aberrant tissue repair. Recent studies have suggested that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to pulmonary fibrosis. We sought to determine whether hypoxia induces EMT in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). We found that hypoxia induced the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and vimentin and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in transformed and primary human, rat, and mouse AEC, suggesting that hypoxia induces EMT in AEC. Both severe hypoxia and moderate hypoxia induced EMT. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger Euk-134 prevented hypoxia-induced EMT. Moreover, hypoxia-induced expression of alpha-SMA and vimentin was prevented in mitochondria-deficient rho(0) cells, which are incapable of ROS production during hypoxia. CoCl(2) and dimethyloxaloylglycine, two compounds that stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-alpha under normoxia, failed to induce alpha-SMA expression in AEC. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active HIF-1alpha did not induce alpha-SMA. However, loss of HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha abolished induction of alpha-SMA mRNA during hypoxia. Hypoxia increased the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, and preincubation of AEC with SB431542, an inhibitor of the TGF-beta1 type I receptor kinase, prevented the hypoxia-induced EMT, suggesting that the process was TGF-beta1 dependent. Furthermore, both ROS and HIF-alpha were necessary for hypoxia-induced TGF-beta1 upregulation. Accordingly, we have provided evidence that hypoxia induces EMT of AEC through mitochondrial ROS, HIF, and endogenous TGF-beta1 signaling.",

Thus, heavy smokers are at high risk for development, impairment and failed response to treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The article is an update regarding the influence of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species on COPD; however, we do not intend to describe ROS and RNS actions on the entire lung tissue. Here, we focus on the airways, because in human most of the described effects of ROS and RNS species are measured on respiratory epithelial cells obtained by bronchoscopy. ROS and RNS species are physiological compounds in cells and risk factors for several respiratory diseases. In general, both kinds of species are thermodynamically stabile, but their reaction behaviors in cellular environments are very different. For example, the life times of the superoxide anion radical range from micro/milliseconds up to minutes and even hours in in-vitro model systems. Oxidative stress by cigarette smoke was investigated in detail by the authors of this article. In addition, original studies by the authors on the amount of fine particulate matter and trace elements in lung biopsies after defined inhalation indicate a distortion of the equilibrium between oxidants and antioxidants. We also try to present some modern views with respect to genomic medicine for future therapeutic perspectives, although this is an upcoming sector of COPD therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Selenite may exert its cytotoxic effects against cancer cells via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We investigated sources of, and the cellular response to, superoxide radical anion (O2 (·-)) generated in human A549 lung cancer cells after treatment with selenite. A temporal delay was observed between selenite treatment and increases in O2 (·-) production and biomarkers of apoptosis/necrosis, indicating that the reduction of selenite by the glutathione reductase/NADPH system (yielding O2 (·-)) is a minor contributor to ROS production under these conditions. By contrast, mitochondrial and NADPH oxidase O2 (·-) generation were the major contributors. Treatment with a ROS scavenger [poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated superoxide dismutase (SOD) or sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate] 20 h after the initial selenite treatment inhibited both ROS generation and apoptosis determined at 24 h. In addition, SOD1 was selectively upregulated and its perinuclear cytoplasmic distribution was colocalised with the cellular distribution of selenium. Interestingly, messenger RNA for manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, inducible haem oxygenase 1 and glutathione peroxidase either remained unchanged or showed a delayed response to selenite treatment. Colocalisation of Cu and Se in these cells (Weekley et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133:18272-18279, 2011) potentially results from the formation of a Cu-Se species, as indicated by Cu K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra. Overall, SOD1 is upregulated in response to selenite-mediated ROS generation, and this likely leads to an accumulation of toxic hydrogen peroxide that is temporally related to decreased cancer cell viability. Increased expression of SOD1 gene/protein coupled with formation of a Cu-Se species may explain the colocalisation of Cu and Se observed in these cells.",

Treatment with the selective RARalpha agonist Ro 40-6055 completely mimicked the effects of ATRA on growth and transactivation of a betaRAREx2-luciferase reporter construct, while RARbeta- and gamma-specific analogues were ineffective. Furthermore, ATRA-regulated growth and transactivation could be completely blocked by a RARalpha-selective receptor antagonist. Thus, ATRA potently inhibits anchorage-independent growth in HT29 cells and this effect is mainly if not exclusively mediated by the retinoic acid receptor alpha.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage to biomolecules have been postulated to be involved in the causation and progression of several chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, the two major causes of morbidity and mortality in Western world. Consequently dietary antioxidants, which inactivate ROS and provide protection from oxidative damage are being considered as important preventive strategic molecules. Carotenoids have been implicated as important dietary nutrients having antioxidant potential, being involved in the scavenging of two of the ROS, singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) and peroxyl radicals generated in the process of lipid peroxidation. Carotenoids are lipophilic molecules which tend to accumulate in lipophilic compartments like membranes or lipoproteins. Chronic ethanol consumption significantly increases hydrogen peroxide and decreases mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) in cells overexpressing CYP2E1. The depletion of mitochondrial GSH and the rise of hydrogen peroxide are responsible for the ethanol-induced apoptosis. Increased intake of lycopene, a major carotenoid in tomatoes, consumed as the all-trans-isomer attenuates alcohol induced apoptosis in 2E1 cells and reduces risk of prostate, lung and digestive cancers. Cancer-preventive activities of carotenoids have been associated as well as with their antioxidant properties and the induction and stimulation of intercellular communication via gap junctions which play a role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Gap junctional communication between cells which may be a basis for protection against cancer development is independent of the antioxidant property.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been successfully used to treat various solid tumors. However, some cancer types respond poorly to PDT, including urothelial carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. The therapeutic recalcitrance is in part due to the use of photosensitizers with suboptimal optical/ photochemical properties and unfavorable pharmacokinetics.;To circumvent these drawbacks, a second-generation photosensitizer with improved optical/photochemical properties, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPC), was encapsulated in interstitially targeted, polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes (ITLs) intended for systemic administration. The ZnPC-ITLs were examined for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidation capacity and validated for tumoricidal efficacy in human extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Sk-Cha1) cells. ZnPC-ITL uptake and the mechanism and mode of PDT-induced cell death were studied.;The ITL formulation was optimized on the basis of fluorescence spectroscopy and photon correlation spectroscopy. The extent of ROS generation, protein oxidation, and membrane oxidation were determined by the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, tryptophan oxidation, and calcein leakage assays, respectively. PDT efficacy was evaluated by measuring mitochondrial activity and apoptosis-/necrosis-specific staining in combination with flow cytometry. The uptake of fluorescently labeled ITLs was assayed by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and fluorescence spectroscopy.;ZnPC-ITLs exhibited maximum ROS-generating and oxidation potential at a ZnPC:lipid molar ratio of 0.003. PDT of Sk-Cha1 cells incubated with ZnPC-ITLs induced cell death in a lipid concentration- dependent manner. The mode of PDT-induced cell death comprised both apoptosis and necrosis, with necrotic cell death predominating. Post-PDT cell death was attributable to pre-PDT ZnPC-ITL uptake by cancer cells, which was more efficient at smaller ITL diameters and a more positive surface charge.;ZnPC-ITLs constitute a nanoparticulate photosensitizer delivery system capable of inducing apoptosis and necrosis in cultured extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells by PDT-mediated oxidative processes. PDT-induced cell death is dependent on the extent of ITL uptake, which in turn relies on ITL size and zeta potential.",
