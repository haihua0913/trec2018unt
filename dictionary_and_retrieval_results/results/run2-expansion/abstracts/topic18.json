PD-L1 may be expressed by metastatic melanoma (MM). However, its clinical and biological significance remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether expression of PD-L1 in MM identifies a biologically more aggressive form of the disease, carrying prognostic relevance.;PD-L1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using two different antibodies in primary tumors and paired metastases from 81 melanoma patients treated at a single institution. Protein expression levels were correlated with PD-L1 mRNA, BRAF mutational status and clinical outcome. PD-L1(+) and PD-L1(-) subsets of the A375 cell line were stabilized in vitro and compared using gene expression profiling and functional assays. Results were confirmed using xenograft models.;PD-L1 membrane positivity was detected in 30/81 (37%) of patients. By multivariate analysis, Breslow thickness and PD-L1 membrane positivity were independent risk factors for melanoma-specific death {PD-L1 5% cutoff [hazard ratio (HR) 3.92, confidence interval (CI) 95% 1.61-9.55 P < 0.003], PD-L1 as continuous variable (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04 P < 0.002)}. PD-L1 expression defined a subset of the BRAF-mutated A375 cell line characterized by a highly invasive phenotype and by enhanced ability to grow in xenograft models.;PD-L1 is an independent prognostic marker in melanoma.

In the overall cohort, PD-L1 expression was geographically associated with infiltrating immune cells (P < 0.001), although lymphocyte-rich regions were not always associated with PD-L1 expression. Expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells and immune infiltrates was significantly associated with expression of PD-1 on lymphocytes. PD-L2, the second ligand for PD-1, was associated with PD-L1 expression. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression correlated with objective response to anti-PD-1 therapy, when analyzing either the specimen obtained closest to therapy or the highest scoring sample among multiple biopsies from individual patients. These correlations were stronger than borderline associations of PD-1 expression or the presence of intratumoral immune cell infiltrates with response.;Tumor PD-L1 expression reflects an immune-active microenvironment and, while associated other immunosuppressive molecules, including PD-1 and PD-L2, is the single factor most closely correlated with response to anti-PD-1 blockade.

Expression of PD-L1 on the cell surface of either tumor cells or infiltrating immune cells is associated with a higher likelihood of response to PD-1 blockade in multiple studies. Most mAbs to PD-L1 in use are directed to its extracellular domain and immunohistochemically stain tumor tissue with a mixture of cytoplasmic and membrane staining. Cytoplasmic staining obscures the interpretation of a positive reaction on the tumor cell membrane, and thus affects the accuracy of PD-L1 scoring systems. We developed a mAb to the cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, 405.9A11 (9A11), which is both more selective for membranous PD-L1 and more sensitive in IHC and Western blotting, compared with previous mAbs specific for the PD-L1 extracellular domain. Here, we compare immunohistochemical staining patterns of PD-L1 expression in five types of tumors, using five PD-L1 mAbs: 9A11, 7G11, and three commercially available mAbs.

Endothelial cells within the melanomas were laminin-receptor-positive. As laminin is found primarily in basement membranes, laminin receptors are expressed mainly by cells in contact with these structures, e.g., endothelial, epithelial, and carcinoma cells. The nonepithelial uveal melanomas, which produce only little basement membrane material, if any, seem to have no need for laminin receptors, at least provided that basement membranes do not have to be traversed.

In malignant melanoma, its potential contribution to chemoresistance is uncertain. Here, we show that ABCB5, which functions as a determinant of membrane potential and regulator of cell fusion in physiologic skin progenitor cells, is expressed in clinical malignant melanoma tumors and preferentially marks a subset of hyperpolarized, CD133+ stem cell phenotype-expressing tumor cells in malignant melanoma cultures and clinical melanomas. We found that ABCB5 blockade significantly reversed resistance of G3361 melanoma cells to doxorubicin, an agent to which clinical melanomas have been found refractory, resulting in a 43% reduction in the LD50 from 4 to 2.3 micromol/L doxorubicin (P < 0.05). Our results identified ABCB5-mediated doxorubicin efflux transport as the underlying mechanism of resistance, because ABCB5 blockade significantly enhanced intracellular drug accumulation. Consistent with this novel ABCB5 function and mechanism in doxorubicin resistance, gene expression levels of the transporter across a panel of human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute for drug screening correlated significantly with tumor resistance to doxorubicin (r = 0.44; P = 0.016). Our results identify ABCB5 as a novel drug transporter and chemoresistance mediator in human malignant melanoma. Moreover, our findings show that ABCB5 is a novel molecular marker for a distinct subset of chemoresistant, stem cell phenotype-expressing tumor cells among melanoma bulk populations and indicate that these chemoresistant cells can be specifically targeted via ABCB5 to enhance cytotoxic efficacy.",

Purified gangliosides in aqueous solution form micelles and, at high density, form lactones. Their antigenic expression (physical conformation and orientation) on the cell surface is governed by the nature of the sphingosine and the fatty acids they contain. Evidence is accruing to show that the nature of the fatty acid moiety of gangliosides differs in normal and neoplastic cells. Gangliosides per se are not immunogenic and require extrinsic adjuvanticity. Preparation of a melanoma cell vaccine for active immunotherapy requires an understanding of the ganglioside profile of melanoma, the ganglioside-associated heterogeneity of melanoma, and the role of shed melanoma gangliosides in the immunosuppression of cell mediated and humoral immunity. In addition, the role of some of the anti-ganglioside antibodies in the elimination of shed gangliosides, the cytotoxic killing of tumor cells, as well as in the down-regulation of lymphocyte functions must be considered in the formulation of vaccine.

        "Doc_abstract":"Carcinosarcomas of the gynecologic tract, also known as malignant mixed MÃ¼llerian tumors, are aggressive neoplasms with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed, which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study.;Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2), fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor.;Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components.;This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases are of epithelial origin. This finding may serve as a basis for possible therapeutic approaches using antibodies that have already shown significant value in a number of other malignant tumors.",

Although evidence describing the function of CAV1 in several cancer types has recently accumulated, its role in melanoma tumor formation and progression remains poorly explored. Here, by using B16F10 melanoma cells as an experimental system, we directly explore the function of CAV1 in melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. We first show that CAV1 expression promotes proliferation, whereas it suppresses migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro. When orthotopically implanted in the skin of mice, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 form tumors that are similar in size to their control counterparts. An experimental metastasis assay shows that CAV1 expression suppresses the ability of B16F10 cells to form lung metastases in C57Bl/6 syngeneic mice. Additionally, CAV1 protein and mRNA levels are found to be significantly reduced in human metastatic melanoma cell lines and human tissue from metastatic lesions. Finally, we show that following integrin activation, B16F10 cells expressing CAV1 display reduced expression levels and activity of FAK and Src proteins. Furthermore, CAV1 expression markedly reduces the expression of integrin Î²(3) in B16F10 melanoma cells. In summary, our findings provide experimental evidence that CAV1 may function as an antimetastatic gene in malignant melanoma.",

The identification of intrinsic mechanisms fostering melanoma dedifferentiation may provide actionable therapeutic targets to improve current treatments. Here, we identify NFATc2 transcription factor as an intrinsic regulator of human melanoma dedifferentiation. In panels of melanoma cell lines, NFATc2 expression correlated inversely with MITF at both mRNA and protein levels. NFATc2(+/Hi) melanoma cell lines were CD271(+) and deficient for expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens (MDAs) MART-1, gp100, tyrosinase and of GPNMB, PGC1-Î± and Rab27a, all regulated by MITF. Targeting of NFATc2 by small interfering RNA, short hairpin RNA and by an NFATc2 inhibitor upregulated MITF, MDAs, GPNMB, PGC-1Î±, tyrosinase activity and pigmentation and suppressed CD271. Mechanistically, we found that NFATc2 controls melanoma dedifferentiation by inducing expression in neoplastic cells of membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-Î± (mTNF-Î±) and that melanoma-expressed TNF-Î± regulates a c-myc-Brn2 axis. Specifically, NFATc2, mTNF-Î± and expression of TNF receptors were significantly correlated in panels of cell lines. NFATc2 silencing suppressed TNF-Î± expression, and neutralization of melanoma-expressed TNF-Î± promoted melanoma differentiation. Moreover, silencing of NFATc2 and TNF-Î± neutralization downmodulated c-myc and POU3F2/Brn2. Brn2 was strongly expressed in NFATc2(+/Hi) MITF(Lo) cell lines and its silencing upregulated MITF. Targeting of c-myc, by silencing or by a c-myc inhibitor, suppressed Brn2 and upregulated MITF and MART-1 in melanoma cells. The relevance of NFATc2-dependent melanoma dedifferentiation for immune escape was shown by cytolytic T-cell assays. NFATc2(Hi) MITF(Lo) MDA(Lo) HLA-A2.1(+) melanoma cells were poorly recognized by MDA-specific and HLA-A2-restricted CTL lines, but NFATc2 targeting significantly increased CTL-mediated tumor recognition. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of NFATc2 promotes melanoma dedifferentiation and immune escape. ",

MIC-1 is also expressed at higher levels in melanomas; however, its role in tumorigenesis is unknown. This report identifies a novel function for MIC-1 in cancer. MIC-1 was overexpressed in approximately 67% of advanced melanomas, accompanied by fivefold to six-fold higher levels of secreted protein in serum of melanoma patients compared with normal individuals. Constitutively active mutant (V600E)B-Raf in melanoma regulated downstream MIC-1 expression. Indeed, small-interfering RNA-mediated targeting of MIC-1 or (V600E)B-Raf reduced expression and secretion by three-fold to fivefold. This decrease in MIC-1 levels reduced melanoma tumorigenesis by approximately threefold, but did not alter cultured cell growth, suggesting a unique function other than growth control. Instead, inhibition of MIC-1 was found to mechanistically retard melanoma tumor vascular development, subsequently affecting tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. This role in melanoma angiogenesis was confirmed by comparing MIC-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) function in chick chorioallantoic membrane and matrigel plug assays. Similar to VEGF in melanomas, MIC-1 stimulated directional vessel development, acting as a potent angiogenic factor. Thus, MIC-1 is secreted from melanoma cells together with VEGF to promote vascular development mediated by (V600E)B-Raf signaling.",

As other proteases, in particular matrix metalloproteinases and some cathepsins, but not catK, have been described to mediate melanoma invasion, we studied catK in melanoma. Immunostaining revealed strong catK expression in most primary melanomas and all cutaneous melanoma metastases. Melanocytic nevi also demonstrated catK expression, but it was less intense than in melanomas. Melanoma lines express both the pro- and the active form of catK and internalize extracellular collagen into lysosomes. Inhibition of catK greatly reduced melanoma cell invasion through Matrigel basement membrane matrix and increased detection of internalized collagen.

Classically, MT1-MMP regulates a verity of cellular functions including cell-to-cell interaction and cell-to-matrix communication. Recently, MT1-MMP has been found to also modulate gene expression. To specifically assess MT1-MMP dependent gene regulation in melanoma, microarray gene expression analysis was performed in a melanoma cell line whose metastatic properties depend on the activity of MT1-MMP. We identified the tumor suppressor gene SPRY4 as a new transcriptional target of MT1-MMP that is negatively regulated by the protease. Knockdown of MT1-MMP enhances SPRY4 expression at the mRNA and protein level. SPRY4 expression inversely correlates with that of MT1-MMP in melanoma samples and importantly, correlates with melanoma patient survival. SPRY4 modulates MT1-MMP dependent cell migration such that inhibition of SPRY4 rescues cell migration that has been impaired by MT1-MMP knock down. MT1-MMP decreases SPRY4 in part through an MMP2/RAC1 axis we previously show promotes cell motility downstream of MT1-MMP.

Positive reactions against all cell lines were found in serum from each group of donors. The degree of reactivity was dependent on the cell line used. Sequential absorption with AB Rh+ and pooled platelets of more than 200 donors either reduced the titer of sera or rendered a great part of the sera negative, demonstrating that antibodies against HL-A antigens and other tissue antigens were involved. The remaining positive sera were further absorbed with pooled cells from 6- to 8-week-old fetuses. This step abolished the reactivity of most sera, indicating the relatively high frequency of antibodies in males and females against fetal antigens expressed also on melanoma and other cells. In order to determine the specificity of the few remaining positive sera, absorptions with three different melanoma cell lines, a brain tumor and fibroblasts were carried out. The results showed only partial cross-reactivity between different cell lines. No evidence was obtained from this study for the existence of a common cross-reacting membrane-associated antigen on human malignant melanoma.

We explored the function of melanoma-derived exosomes in the formation of primary tumors and metastases in mice and human subjects. Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently 'educating' bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and Met. Reducing Met expression in exosomes diminished the pro-metastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating CD45(-)C-KIT(low/+)TIE2(+) bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. RAB1A, RAB5B, RAB7 and RAB27A, regulators of membrane trafficking and exosome formation, were highly expressed in melanoma cells. Rab27A RNA interference decreased exosome production, preventing bone marrow education and reducing, tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70, an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Our data show that exosome production, transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis, has prognostic value and offers promise for new therapeutic directions in the metastatic process.",

Moreover, treatment of melanoma cells with MAb F10-44-2 enhances their migration through gelatin-coated membranes and invasion through reconstituted basement membranes. Treatment of melanoma cells with several known CD44 ligands, including hyaluronate, extracellular-matrix proteins, and osteopontin, did not induce MMP-2 production.

We could identify a CD4(+) T cell epitope derived from the human melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP) (also known as high m.w.-melanoma-associated Ag), which is strongly expressed on >90% of human melanoma lesions and is important for the motility and invasion of melanoma cells. However, MCSP is not strictly tumor specific, because it is also expressed in a variety of normal tissues. Therefore, self tolerance should prevent the induction of strong T cell responses against these Ags by vaccination strategies. In contrast, breaking self tolerance to this Ag by effectively manipulating the immune system might mediate antitumor responses, although it would bear the risk of autoimmunity. Surprisingly, we could readily isolate CD4(+) Th cells from the blood of a healthy donor-recognizing peptide MCSP(693-709) on HLA-DR11-expressing melanoma cells. Broad T cell reactivity against this Ag could be detected in the peripheral blood of both healthy donors and melanoma patients, without any apparent signs of autoimmune disease. In some patients, a decline of T cell reactivity was observed upon tumor progression.

From 12 patients metastatic tissue samples were also examined. In addition to ezrin staining, Mib-1 proliferation antigen, p53 and Bcl-2 were evaluated.

The intensity of ezrin immunoreactivity was associated with tumor thickness (Breslow, P=0.0008) and with tumor invasion level (Clark, P=0.004), thicker tumors having stronger immunoreactivity. Also, there was a correlation between higher Mib-1 index in tumors and strong ezrin expression. All metastatic samples (n=12) showed positive ezrin immunoreactivity. In univariate analysis of survival, patients (n=76) with positive ezrin immunoreactivity had worse clinical disease behavior than those (n=19) without ezrin immunoreactivity, but the difference was not significant (P=0.19). In multivariate analysis of survival, the ezrin immunoreactivity was not a significant marker.

Primarily, we observed characteristic changes in cell morphology, and also found re-established cell-cell contacts in MIA-deficient cell clones grown in monolayer culture. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a downregulation of N-cadherin expression and a reinduction of E-cadherin expression in the MIA-deficient cell clones. Further, both cancer cDNA array and protein arrays verified a marked downregulation of several other melanoma-associated genes (e.g. membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase tissue-type plasminogen activator integrin beta3, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteins and fibronectin) in the MIA-deficient melanoma cells, confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting.

The results show that MCSP expression in radial growth phase, vertical growth phase, or metastatic cell lines causes sustained activation of Erk1,2, enhanced growth, and motility which all require the cytoplasmic domain of the MCSP core protein. MCSP expression in a radial growth phase cell line also promotes an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition based on changes in cell morphology and the expression of several epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Finally, MCSP enhances the expression of c-Met and hepatocyte growth factor, and inhibiting c-Met expression or activation limits the increased growth and motility of multiple melanoma cell lines.

We have previously shown that RhoA GTPase and its effector ROCK negatively control FasL membrane expression in murine melanoma B16F10 cells. In this study, we found that B16F10 treatment with the ROCK inhibitor H1152 reduced melanoma development in vivo through FasL membrane overexpression. Although H1152 treatment did not reduce tumor growth in vitro, pretreatment of tumor cells with this inhibitor delayed tumor appearance, and slowed tumor growth in C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice. Thanks to the use of mice-bearing mutated Fas receptors (B6/lpr), we found that reduced tumor growth, observed in immunocompetent mice, was linked to FasL overexpression induced by H1152 treatment. Tumor growth analysis in immunosuppressed NUDE and IFN-Î³-KO mice highlighted major roles for T lymphocytes and IFN-Î³ in the H1152-induced tumor growth reduction. Histological analyses of subcutaneous tumors, obtained from untreated versus H1152-treated B16F10 cells, showed that H1152 pretreatment induced a strong intratumoral infiltration of leukocytes. Cytofluorometric analysis showed that among these leukocytes, the number of activated CD8 lymphocytes was increased. Moreover, their antibody-induced depletion highlighted their main responsibility in tumor growth reduction. Subcutaneous tumor growth was also reduced by repeated intravenous injections of a clinical ROCK inhibitor, Fasudil. Finally, H1152-induced ROCK inhibition also reduced pulmonary metastasis implantation independently of T cell-mediated immune response.

Moreover, we show that PTP4A3 and MMP14 colocalize and that the vesicular trafficking of MMP14 is faster in the presence of active PTP4A3. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of MMP14 expression in uveal melanoma cells expressing PTP4A3 impairs their migration in vitro and invasiveness in vivo.;Our observations indicate that PTP4A3 increases cell membrane accumulation of MMP14 as a result of increased cellular trafficking of the metalloprotease. We also show that downregulation of MMP14 expression reduced PTP4A3-induced cell migration and invasiveness. Taken together, our findings suggest that PTP4A3-related subcellular localization of MMP14 is an important event in metastasis induction.",

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) plays a major role in oncogenesis through its various functions in lipid transport, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction. Increased expression of Cav-1 in tumor cells has been associated with aggressiveness and poor survival. More recently, loss of stromal Cav-1 expression was linked to poor survival and increased metastatic potential in breast and prostate cancer. To date, there is no study addressing the clinical significance of Cav-1 expression in malignant melanoma (MM). Our study consisted of 44 cases of MM: 12 MM lymph node metastases from patients with short survival, 12 MM lymph node metastases from patients with long survival and 20 primary MM. All cases were stained with Cav-1 antibodies. Cav-1 expression in melanoma and stromal cells was quantified using a 3 point scale: 0 = no staining, 1 = diffuse weak staining or strong staining in < 30% of cells, and 2 = diffuse strong staining. A score of 0-1 represented low Cav-1 expression and a score of 2 represented high Cav-1 expression. In patients with MM lymph node metastases, a low stromal Cav-1 expression was associated with shorter survival when compared to the high stromal Cav-1 expression group (median survival 252 days versus 3,508 days, p value 0.0054). Conversely, high Cav-1 expression in melanoma cells was associated with a longer survival in primary MM (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, high expression of stromal Cav-1 correlates with longer survival in malignant melanoma metastases, and high expression of Cav-1 in melanoma cells correlates with longer survival in primary malignant melanoma.",

Soluble CD44 can abolish the cell proliferation-promoting effect of HA on melanoma cell lines, suggesting that a better understanding of the shedding process might identify ways of blocking tumor cell proliferation. ADAM10, ADAM17, and MMP14 have previously been implicated in the shedding of CD44 from various tumor cells. Using immunohistochemistry we demonstrate that ADAM10 and ADAM17 but not MMP14 are significantly expressed on melanoma cells in histological sections. In human melanoma cell lines expression of these proteases could be blocked by transfection with appropriate siRNAs. However, only blocking of ADAM10 expression led to decreased shedding of CD44. In parallel, cell proliferation was promoted. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that ADAM10 and CD44 colocalize on the cell surface.

MT1-MMP can degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins directly and/or indirectly by activating soluble MMPs such as pro-MMP-2. Although MT1-MMP is upregulated in malignant melanoma, the biological consequences of elevated MT1-MMP expression for tumor progression are not entirely understood. In the current study, we have utilized the Bowes melanoma line for evaluating MT1-MMP in invasion and growth. Our studies extend the earlier observations to demonstrate that MT1-MMP expression in Bowes melanoma cells promotes selective invasion into matrigel but not matrices consisting of type-I collagen. Furthermore, MT1-MMP expressing melanoma cells exhibit increased migration in response to laminin 1 but not to type-I or type-IV collagen. MT1-MMP expression results in enhanced 3 dimensional growth in agarose gels and in long-term cultures within matrigel. The hydroxymate inhibitor BB94 inhibits MT1-MMP enhanced invasion and growth in 3 dimensional culture systems, but had no effect on increased motility. We demonstrated that MT1-MMP expression significantly facilitated tumorigenicity and growth by intradermal injection.

These tumors induced numerous lymphatics at the invasive front, and compressed or destroyed VEGF receptor (R)-3-positive lymphatics were observed within the solid tumors. The lymphatics in the CAM and in the A375 melanomas could also be demonstrated with an antibody against Prox 1, a highly specific marker of lymphatic endothelial cells.

Lymphangiogenesis was inhibited to some extent when A375 melanoma cells were transfected with cDNA encoding soluble VEGFR-3 (sflt4), and the BrdU labeling index of the lymphatics in these tumors was 3.9%.

Identification of patients at high risk of metastases may provide indication for a frequent follow-up for early detection of metastases and treatment. The analysis of the gene expression profiles of primary human uveal melanomas showed high expression of SDCBP gene (encoding for syndecan-binding protein-1 or mda-9/syntenin), which appeared higher in patients with recurrence, whereas expression of syndecans was lower and unrelated to progression. Moreover, we found that high expression of SDCBP gene was related to metastatic progression in two additional independent datasets of uveal melanoma patients. More importantly, immunohistochemistry showed that high expression of mda-9/syntenin protein in primary tumors was significantly related to metastatic recurrence in our cohort of patients. Mda-9/syntenin expression was confirmed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in cultured uveal melanoma cells or primary tumors. Interestingly, mda-9/syntenin showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in cell lines and in a fraction of patients, suggesting its possible involvement in nuclear functions. A pseudo-metastatic model of uveal melanoma to the liver was developed in NOD/SCID/IL2RÎ³ null mice and the study of mda-9/syntenin expression in primary and metastatic lesions revealed higher mda-9/syntenin in metastases. The inhibition of SDCBP expression by siRNA impaired the ability of uveal melanoma cells to migrate in a wound-healing assay. Moreover, silencing of SDCBP in mda-9/syntenin-high uveal melanoma cells inhibited the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-triggered invasion of matrigel membranes and inhibited the activation of FAK, AKT and Src. Conversely syntenin overexpression in mda-9/syntenin-low uveal melanoma cells mediated opposite effects. These results suggest that mda-9/syntenin is involved in uveal melanoma progression and that it warrants further investigation as a candidate molecular marker of metastases and a potential therapeutic target.",

However, other factors could be implicated, such as the balance of soluble versus membrane-bound forms or the secretion of death ligands on the surface of microvesicles, as described previously by our group in human T cells. In the present study, we analyzed the expression and secretion of FasL and APO2 ligand (APO2L)/TRAIL in the human melanoma cell line MelJuSo. We have observed the expression of preformed FasL and APO2L/TRAIL in these cells, their secretion associated with microvesicles upon melanoma activation with PHA or with alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and the toxicity of these microvesicles against normal human T cell blasts. We have also observed that the mechanism of secretion of FasL and APO2L/TRAIL from melanoma cells is depending both on microtubules and actin filaments. From these data, it can be concluded that the MelJuSo melanoma cell line has the possibility to \"counterattack\" against activated immune effector cells.

Tumor angiogenesis represents an integral component of cancer metastasis prompting us to investigate a possible role of mda-9/syntenin in inducing angiogenesis. Genetic (gain-of-function and loss-of-function) and pharmacologic approaches were used to modify mda-9/syntenin expression in normal immortal melanocytes, early radial growth phase melanoma, and metastatic melanoma cells. The consequence of modifying mda-9/syntenin expression on angiogenesis was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo assays, including tube formation assays using human vascular endothelial cells, chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays and xenograft tumor animal models. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments confirm that MDA-9/syntenin induces angiogenesis by augmenting expression of several proangiogenic factors/genes. Experimental evidence is provided for a model of angiogenesis induction by MDA-9/syntenin in which MDA-9/syntenin interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM), activating Src and FAK resulting in activation by phosphorylation of Akt, which induces hypoxia inducible factor 1-Î± (HIF-1Î±). The HIF-1Î± activates transcription of insulin growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which is secreted thereby promoting angiogenesis and further induces endothelial cells to produce and secrete VEGF-A augmenting tumor angiogenesis. Our studies delineate an unanticipated cell nonautonomous function of MDA-9/syntenin in the context of angiogenesis, which may directly contribute to its metastasis-promoting properties. As a result, targeting MDA-9/syntenin or its downstream-regulated molecules may provide a means of simultaneously impeding metastasis by both directly inhibiting tumor cell transformed properties (autonomous) and indirectly by blocking angiogenesis (nonautonomous).",

Laminin, a major glycoprotein integrated into basement membranes, is observed in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. A recent study described an association between melanoma cells and endothelial cells via an amorphous matrix containing laminin. In the current study, we have examined 45 cases of human primary and metastatic melanomas by electron microscopy for the presence of an amorphous matrix. We observed an amorphous matrix without a clearly delineated lamina or basement membrane in 41 of the 45 melanomas studied. 28 cases with tissue blocks available for study were examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of laminin and type IV collagen. We observed the presence of an angiocentric matrix containing laminin in 24 of the 28 melanomas studied. Since laminin is involved in tumor migration, the presence of laminin between melanoma cells and small vessels suggests a role for this material in periendothelial tumor migration. However, further study is required to characterize the nature of this material and the mechanisms involved.",

While the role of BRAF(V600E) in tumorigenesis is well established, its involvement in metastasis that is clinically observed in melanoma patients remains a topic of debate. Here, we show that BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells have extensive invasion activity as assayed by the generation of F-actin and cortactin foci that mediate membrane protrusion, and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) blocks melanoma cell invasion. In a BRAF(V600E)-driven murine melanoma model or in patients' tumor biopsies, cortactin foci decrease upon inhibitor treatment. In addition, genome-wide expression analysis shows that a number of invadopodia-related genes are downregulated after BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) induces phosphorylation of cortactin and the exocyst subunit Exo70 through ERK, which regulates actin dynamics and matrix metalloprotease secretion, respectively. Our results provide support for the role of BRAF(V600E) in metastasis and suggest that inhibiting invasion is a potential therapeutic strategy against melanoma. ",

Metformin caused a G(2)/M cell cycle arrest associated with apoptotic death of melanoma cells, as confirmed by the flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle/DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure and caspase activation. Metformin-mediated apoptosis of melanoma cells was preceded by induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, measured by flow cytometry in cells stained with appropriate fluorescent reporter dyes. The expression of tumor suppressor protein p53 was increased, while the mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 were reduced by metformin, as revealed by cell-based ELISA and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Treatment with metformin did not stimulate expression of the cycle blocker p21, indicating that p21 was dispensable for the observed cell cycle arrest. The activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was not required for the anti-melanoma action of metformin, as AMPK inhibitor compound C completely failed to restore viability of metformin-treated B16 cells. Metformin induced autophagy in B16 cells, as demonstrated by flow cytometry-detected increase in intracellular acidification and immunoblot-confirmed upregulation of autophagosome-associated LC3-II. Autophagy inhibitors ammonium chloride and wortmannin partly restored the viability of metformin-treated melanoma cells. Finally, oral administration of metformin led to a significant reduction in tumor size in a B16 mouse melanoma model. These data suggest that anti-melanoma effects of metformin are mediated through p21- and AMPK-independent cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy associated with p53/Bcl-2 modulation, mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress.",

Knockdown of RPS3 by siRNA suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Further mechanism studies showed that RPS3 knockdown in melanoma cells triggered the release of cytochrome C (Cyto C) from mitochondrial, increased the location of BID on mitochondrial membrane and the cleavage of the pro-apoptotic proteins (PARP, caspase-3 and -9), promoted the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and the flooding of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) into the mitochondrial, and decreased the expression of the Ca(2+) gatekeeper MICU1 and its location on the mitochondrial. We also found that knockdown of RPS3 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a melanoma xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, we showed that RPS3 was highly expressed in melanoma cell lines and melanoma tumor tissues, and overexpression of RPS3 was associated with the poor prognosis of melanoma patients.

This phenomenon may indicate differentiation plasticity, a feature melanoma cells may share with stem cells in the developing embryo. Recent studies have indicated that VM and tumorigenicity of human malignant melanoma may depend on the signaling pathways of an embryonic morphogen, Nodal. However, given the secretory nature of Nodal protein and melanoma cell heterogeneity, it remains unclear whether the Nodal-expressing cells participate directly or indirectly in VM that is potentially related to tumorigenic growth. We have developed a humanized murine xenograft model in which developing human melanomas may be sequentially studied during early stages of tumorigenic growth within a physiological human dermal microenvironment. Nodal protein localized diffusely to melanoma cell membranes, with occasional foci of accentuated reactivity in patterns suggestive of channel formation. Similar findings were detected in a limited number of patient-derived tumors. In situ hybridization confirmed Nodal mRNA to be restricted to tumor cells within xenografts that formed arborizing networks in patterns consistent with VM. These data indicate that Nodal gene expression is associated with formation of VM-like structures in a physiologically relevant model of human melanoma tumorigenesis, and further support a key role for Nodal expression in the formation of channel-like structures. The humanized xenograft model should be useful in future studies to define the mechanistic pathways responsible for VM and melanoma progression.",

It engages in several functions, including cell polarity and migration, and in Hippo signaling during development. Homozygous deletions in oral cancer suggest that FAT1 may play a tumor suppressor role, although overexpression of FAT1 has been reported in some other cancers. Here we show using Northern blotting that human melanoma cell lines variably but universally express FAT1 and less commonly FAT2, FAT3, and FAT4. Both normal melanocytes and keratinocytes also express comparable FAT1 mRNA relative to melanoma cells. Analysis of the protein processing of FAT1 in keratinocytes revealed that, like Drosophila FAT, human FAT1 is cleaved into a non-covalent heterodimer before achieving cell surface expression. The use of inhibitors also established that such cleavage requires the proprotein convertase furin. However, in melanoma cells, the non-cleaved proform of FAT1 is also expressed at the cell surface together with the furin-cleaved heterodimer. Moreover, furin-independent processing generates a potentially functional proteolytic product in melanoma cells, a persistent 65-kDa membrane-bound cytoplasmic fragment no longer in association with the extracellular fragment. In vitro localization studies of FAT1 showed that melanoma cells display high levels of cytosolic FAT1 protein, whereas keratinocytes, despite comparable FAT1 expression levels, exhibited mainly cell-cell junctional staining. Such differences in protein distribution appear to reconcile with the different protein products generated by dual FAT1 processing. We suggest that the uncleaved FAT1 could promote altered signaling, and the novel products of alternate processing provide a dominant negative function in melanoma.",

Twenty-six of the 27 tumor samples showed a significant increase (up to 15-fold) in the perlecan mRNA levels when compared with normal tissue. This change correlated with a vast deposition of perlecan protein core in the pericellular matrix of metastatic melanomas. Furthermore, we have established a relationship between perlecan expression in clonal melanoma cells (70W) stimulated with neurotrophins and their increased invasiveness. Interestingly, perlecan mRNA levels were up-regulated within 10 min of neurotrophin stimulation, indicating that perlecan is an early response gene.

Efforts to define the cytoarchitecture of the angiogenic response and to ascertain molecular determinants of polarized endothelial migration have been impeded by lack of sensitive and specific immunologic markers for endothelium and vessel wall components. In this study, we utilized monoclonal antibody to platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), a cell-cell adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, to determine extent and patterns of angiogenesis in metastatic melanomas before (N = 7) and after (N = 3) induction of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte responses provoked by administration of experimental melanoma vaccine. PECAM-1 proved to be a more reliable marker for angiogenesis than antibodies to von Willebrand Factor. Although both normal and tumor vessels exhibited prominent staining for PECAM-1, different patterns of endothelial reactivity were observed. Formation of new vessels was associated with i) PECAM-1 redistribution from a constitutive circumferential membrane pattern to a pattern restricted to cell-cell junctions; ii) formation of endothelial cords formed by cell-cell interactions; and iii) eventual development of open lumens. Vessels within inflamed (vaccine-treated) and non-inflamed melanomas did not differ with regard to patterns of PECAM-1 expression. Forming vessels of inflamed melanomas failed to express the cytokine-inducible activation marker, E-selectin. Although normal microvessels and reactive vessels of healing wounds demonstrated prominent staining for alpha 6 laminin receptor, vessels within melanomas showed apparently diminished expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Migration and invasion of tumor cells requires secretion of proteases to facilitate remodeling of the extracellular matrix including basement membranes. Here we used a reconstructed skin model to investigate melanoma growth and invasion in vitro. Using this model we show that the dermoepidermal basement membrane prevents the invasion of metastatic melanoma BLM and MV3 cells in the absence of a stratified epidermis. In the reconstructed skin model, matrix metalloproteinase-9, a protease activated early in melanoma development, is secreted by the keratinocytes and subsequently activated by an unknown soluble factor secreted by the melanoma cells. The dynamic interplay between keratinocytes and melanoma cells is further shown by an altered growth pattern of melanoma cells and the finding that a reconstructed epidermis induces invasion. Overall, our findings show that the invasive behavior of melanoma cells is determined by the melanoma cells themselves, but that the interplay between surrounding keratinocytes and the melanoma cells plays an important role in melanoma invasion.",

Evidence about the role of CXCR4/CXCL12 axis has been reported in several cancers including melanoma. Our goal was to investigate if CXCR4 expression has a prognostic value in malignant melanoma.;Immunohistochemical expression of CXCR4 was evaluated on 71 specimens of primary cutaneous melanoma with a Breslow tumor thickness of >1 mm after radical resection. Associations between baseline patient features and tumors were analyzed by chi(2) test. The prognostic value of CXCR4 expression was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses adjusted by age, sex, Breslow tumor thickness, presence of ulceration, and sentinel lymph node metastases.;CXCR4 expression was detected in 31 of 71 (43.6%) primary cutaneous melanomas. Membrane or cytoplasmic staining for CXCR4 protein was absent in 56% of the tumors. The positive cases were divided into three score classes according to their staining: low in 15 cases (21%), moderate in 10 (14%), and high in 6 (8%). After a median follow-up of 38 months, 26 patients progressed (16 of 26 expressed CXCR4) and 19 died (12 of 19 expressed CXCR4). The CXCR4 expression on tumor cells was correlated with an unfavorable prognosis with a median disease-free and overall survival of 22 and 35 months, respectively. The hazard ratios of relapse and death, compared with patients with CXCR4-negative tumors, were 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.1) and 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-7.2), respectively. Median time-to-event (progression and survival) was not reached in patients with CXCR4-negative tumors. In the multivariate analysis, CXCR4 expression, presence of ulceration, and sentinel lymph node status emerged as independent prognostic factors.;This article provides the first evidence that CXCR4 expression could be an independent and powerful prognostic marker in primary cutaneous malignant melanomas.",

As a result, the tumor-associated antigens (TAA) used as targets have to be expressed on the cell surface membrane of malignant cells. Furthermore, since most of the TAA used for active specific immunotherapy are self-antigens, a challenge facing tumor immunologists is to develop strategies which are effective in breaking tolerance to self-antigens. This chapter describes one strategy which relies on the use of peptide mimics of the human high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) as immunogens to implement active specific immunotherapy in patients with malignant melanoma. These mimics, which are isolated from phage display peptide libraries by panning with anti-HMW-MAA monoclonal antibodies, are expected to induce both humoral and cellular anti-HMW-MAA immunity.",

We also examined the expression and distribution of MUC18 in paraffin sections of primary uveal melanomas (n = 23; 5/23 spindle; 18/23 mixed and epithelioid) and normal eyes (n = 3) using a polyclonal goat anti-human antibody to MUC18 visualized with peroxidase and Vector NovaRED. Distribution and intensity of immunostaining was graded semi-quantitatively (grade 0 to 3) by 2 independent observers. All cell lines expressed MUC18 mRNA and protein ( approximately 130 kDa), and showed punctate cell membrane MUC18 immunostaining. Primary melanomas displayed heterogeneous cell membrane and cytoplasmic MUC18, with moderate to strong immunolabelling (> or =grade 2) in approximately 70% of tumours. Vasculature in tumours and in retina and choroid of all melanoma-affected and normal eyes showed intense MUC18 immunostaining.

In the present study, we investigated whether targeting IL-8 by a fully human anti-IL-8 antibody (ABX-IL8) could be a potential therapeutic strategy to control angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of melanoma. The human melanoma cells A375SM (high IL-8 producer) and TXM-13 (intermediate IL-8 producer) were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, which were then treated with ABX-IL8 (1 mg/3 times weekly, i.p., for 3 weeks). Tumor growth of both melanomas in ABX-IL8-treated mice was significantly inhibited when compared with control IgG-treated animals. ABX-IL8 treatment also suppressed experimental metastasis when the melanoma cells were injected intravenously. IL-8 blockade by ABX-IL8 significantly inhibited the promoter activity and the collagenase activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 in human melanoma cells, resulting in decreased invasion through reconstituted basement membrane in vitro. In vivo, ABX-IL8 treatment resulted in decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, and decreased vascularization (angiogenesis) of tumors concomitant with increased apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, in an in vitro vessel formation assay, ABX-IL8 directly interfered with the tubule formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Taken together, these results point to the potential utility of ABX-IL8 as a modality to treat melanoma and other solid tumors either alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy or other anti-tumor agents.",

We investigated here the contribution of elastin-derived peptides (ED), degradation products of elastin, the main component of elastic fibers in melanoma cells invasion and MMP-1 and -2 expression. Our results evidenced fragmentation of elastin at the invasive front of melanoma, particularly in the most invasive tumors where those fibers nearly totally vanished. By electron microscopy, elastolysis was found to occur mainly at the periphery of melanoma cells, where close contact between elastic fibers and cells could be noticed. Therefore, we showed in vitro that plating melanoma cells high tumorigenic potential on ED-coated dishes, selectively enhanced MMP-2, as membrane-type MMP-1 (MT1-MMP) production and activation. Nevertheless, pro-MMP-2 activation was not observed owing to the parallel increase in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 expression. The effects of ED on melanoma cells were found to be mediated by splicing form of beta-galactosidase (S-Gal) occupancy, as being suppressed by lactose. Supplementing collagen lattices with ED led to consistent activation of MMP-2 that can be attributed to TIMP-2 downregulation. Upregulation of MMP-2 activation by ED led to enhanced melanoma cells invasion through S-Gal occupancy. Immunohistochemistry studies, confirmed that S-Gal expression was more prominent at the melanoma invasion site associated with a strong expression of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. We hypothesize that ED following interactions with S-Gal elastin receptor can favor melanoma cells invasion through a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix by upregulating MMP-2 activation.",

How amoeboid migration is regulated by extracellular signals and sustained over time by transcriptional changes is not fully understood. Transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) is well known to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and contribute to metastasis, but melanocytes are neural crest derivatives that have undergone EMT during embryonic development. Surprisingly, we find that in melanoma, TGF-Î² promotes amoeboid features such as cell rounding, membrane blebbing, high levels of contractility, and increased invasion. Using genome-wide transcriptomics, we find that amoeboid melanoma cells are enriched in a TGF-Î²-driven signature. We observe that downstream of TGF-Î², SMAD2 and its adaptor CITED1 control amoeboid behavior by regulating the expression of key genes that activate contractile forces. Moreover, CITED1 is highly upregulated during melanoma progression, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis. CITED1 is coupled to a contractile-rounded, amoeboid phenotype in a panel of 16 melanoma cell lines, in mouse melanoma xenografts, and in 47 human melanoma patients. Its expression is also enriched in the invasive fronts of lesions. Functionally, we show how the TGF-Î²-SMAD2-CITED1 axis promotes different steps associated with progression: melanoma detachment from keratinocytes, 2D and 3D migration, attachment to endothelial cells, and in vivo lung metastatic initial colonization and outgrowth. We propose a novel mechanism by which TGF-Î²-induced transcription sustains actomyosin force in melanoma cells and thereby promotes melanoma progression independently of EMT.",

To enhance the immunogenicity of GM-CSF-secreting tumor cell vaccines, a novel approach expressing GM-CSF as a membrane-bound form (mbGM-CSF) on the tumor cell surface was investigated. The intent was to enhance antigen presentation by increasing interactions between the tumor cell lines in the vaccine and GM-CSF receptor positive antigen presenting cells (APC), notably the patient's Langerhans cells residing within the intradermal injection site. B16.F10 cells engineered to express either membrane-bound or secreted GM-CSF were compared in the B16.F10 mouse melanoma model. We observed that mbGM-CSF on the tumor cell surface retarded growth and induced protective immunity to subsequent wild-type tumor challenge more effectively than tumor cells secreting GM-CSF. Vaccination with irradiated mbGM-CSF B16.F10 also provided strong protection from wild-type tumor challenge, improved therapeutic effects against established tumors, and retarded lung metastases. These results demonstrate that mbGM-CSF B16.F10 cells can induce strong systemic immunity that protects against and therapeutically treats B16.F10 melanoma more effectively than analogous vaccines containing only secreted GM-CSF.

We investigated Fas expression and function in 53 cutaneous melanocytic lesions and 13 melanoma cell lines grown in vitro. Immunohistochemical analysis of Fas expression in cutaneous melanocytic lesions showed moderate to high levels of Fas in common benign melanocytic naevi, but low to undetectable levels in atypical naevi, primary (superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma) and cutaneous melanoma metastases. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of Fas expression in melanoma cell lines revealed undetectable or low levels of cell surface Fas expression in five of the 13 melanoma cell lines. Analysis of Fas signalling by quantification of cell death following exposure to recombinant FasL showed that a reduction in Fas expression results in resistance to FasL-mediated cell death. Furthermore, two of the 13 melanoma cell lines were found to be resistant to FasL-mediated cell death despite conserved Fas expression. Thus seven of the 13 melanoma cell lines were found to have impaired Fas signalling.

Normal human melanocytes contained the lowest levels of both PLA(2)s. Cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) were also expressed in cultured tumor cells as measured by Western blots. The most pronounced overexpression of iPLA(2) and COX-1 was found in two melanoma-derived cells, M14 and COLO38. Normal human melanocytes and the M10 melanoma cell line displayed no COX-2 expression. Using subcellular fractionation, Western blot and confocal microcopy analyses, in paradigmatic SK-MEL28 and SK-MEL93 cells we showed that iPLA(2), COX-1 and even cPLA(2) were equally located in the cytosol, membrane structures and perinuclear region while COX-2 was preferentially associated with the cytosol. Specific inhibitors of these three enzymes significantly reduced the basal proliferation rate either in melanocytes or in melanoma cell lines. These results, coupled with the inhibition of the cell proliferation by electroporation of melanoma cells with cPLA(2) or COX-2 antibodies, demonstrate that a possible correlation between PLA(2)-COX expression and tumor cell proliferation in the melanocytic system does exist. In addition, the high expression level of both PLA(2)s and COXs suggests that eicosanoids modulate cell proliferation and tumor invasiveness.",

Endothelial cells were cultured to confluence on Matrigel before the seeding of melanoma cells. Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that, prior to migration, melanoma cells appeared round and showed cortical F-actin staining. The initial stage of transmigration was characterized by numerous membrane blebs protruding from basolateral surfaces of the melanoma cells, and contact regions showed an abundance of filaments arising in the underlying endothelial cells. Later, pseudopods from the melanoma cells inserted into contact regions between endothelial cells. Eventually, the melanoma cells intercalated with the endothelial cells. At this stage, many endothelial filament bundles terminated at contacts between the endothelial cells and the transmigrating melanoma cell, suggesting active interactions between the two cell types. Upon contact with the Matrigel, melanoma cells began to spread beneath the endothelium, displaying a fibroblastic morphology with prominent stress fibers. To reestablish the monolayer, adjacent endothelial cells extended processes over the melanoma cell. Tumor necrosis factor alpha did not affect the transmigration of melanoma cells from cell lines isolated from several stages of metastasis. However, tumor necrosis factor did promote the transmigration of melanoma cells derived from a non-metastatic lesion. These results thus define cell attachment and cell penetration of the monolayer as two distinct steps in transmigration and suggest that tumor necrosis factor may enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells.",

Advanced melanoma, nevertheless, remains a prime example of poor treatment response that may, in part, be the consequence of activated N-Ras oncoproteins. Besides oncogenic Ras, wild-type Ras gene products also play a key role in receptor tyrosine kinase growth factor signaling, known to be of importance in oncogenesis and tumor progression of a variety of human neoplasms, including malignant melanoma; therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that a pharmacological approach that curtails Ras activity may represent a sensible approach to inhibit melanoma growth. To test this concept, the antitumor activity of S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), a recently discovered Ras antagonist that dislodges Ras from its membrane-anchoring sites, was evaluated. The antitumor activity of FTS was assessed both in vitro and in vivo in two independent SCID mouse xenotransplantation models of human melanoma expressing either wild-type Ras (cell line 518A2) or activated Ras (cell line 607B). We show that FTS (5-50 microM) reduces the amounts of activated N-Ras and wild-type Ras isoforms both in human melanoma cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts, interrupts the Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase in melanoma cells, inhibits the growth of N-Ras-transformed fibroblasts and human melanoma cells in vitro and reverses their transformed phenotype. FTS also causes a profound and statistically significant inhibition of 518A2 (82%) and 607B (90%) human melanoma growth in SCID mice without evidence of drug-related toxicity. Our findings stress the notion that FTS may qualify as a novel and rational treatment approach for human melanoma and possibly other tumors that either carry activated ras genes or rely on Ras signal transduction more heavily than nonmalignant cells.",

In contrast, type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen were present at the periphery of the nevus cell clusters in agreement with the presence of an intact lamina densa. Aggregated tumor cells in malignant melanomas were bordered by a lamina densa when located in a junctional position and lacked this structure when they had migrated into the dermis. This process was accompanied by a drastically reduced staining for collagen type IV and nidogen, whereas laminin was still detectable.

Successful invasion into the brain by tumor cells must include attachment to microvessel endothelial cells, penetration through the blood-brain barrier, and, of relevance, a response to brain survival and growth factors. Neurotrophins (NTs) are important in brain-invasive steps. Human melanoma cell lines express low-affinity NT receptor p75NTR in relation to their brain-metastatic propensity with their invasive properties being regulated by NGF, or nerve growth factor, the prototypic NT. They also express functional TrkC, the putative receptor for the invasion-promoting NT-3. In brain-metastatic melanoma cells, NTs promote invasion by enhancing the production of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degradative enzymes such as heparanase, an enzyme capable of locally destroying both ECM and the basement membrane of the blood-brain barrier. Heparanase is an endo-beta-d-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) chains of ECM HS proteoglycans, and it is a unique metastatic determinant because it is the dominant mammalian HS degradative enzyme. Brain-metastatic melanoma cells also produce autocrine/paracrine factors that influence their growth, invasion, and survival in the brain. Synthesis of these factors may serve to regulate NT production by brain cells adjacent to the neoplastic invasion front, such as astrocytes. Increased NT levels have been observed in tumor-adjacent tissues at the invasion front of human brain melanoma. Additionally, astrocytes may contribute to the brain-metastatic specificity of melanoma cells by producing NT-regulated heparanase. Trophic, autocrine, and paracrine growth factors may therefore determine whether metastatic cells can successfully invade, colonize, and grow in the CNS.",

By flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, expression of P-glycoprotein was not detectable on the protein level in the 10 cell lines analyzed, although by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, MDR-1 gene expression was demonstrated in 2 of 10 cell lines. In addition, immunohistology revealed P-glycoprotein expression in only 1 of 71 melanocytic lesions. In contrast, MRP was detected in a subset of melanoma cell lines by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistology (4 of 10). LRP expression was observed in 8 of 10 melanoma cell lines by immunochemistry and in 10 of 10 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, MRP was detected immunohistologically in almost 50% of primary and metastatic melanoma specimens, although no significant differences were found between metastases taken before or after chemotherapy. Expression of LRP was detected in a subset of nevi with nevus cells exhibiting up to 25% positive LRP reactivity. In 13 of 21 primary melanomas and 23 of 37 metastases, more than 25% of tumor cells were stained by the LRP-56 monoclonal antibody.

Although the expression of membrane transport proteins may explain only the chemoresistance toward lipophilic, natural compounds and not resistance against alkylating agents, the lack of P-glycoprotein expression after chemotherapeutic treatment and the significant expression of MRP and LRP in melanoma cells provide first insights into the drug-resistant phenotype in melanoma.

Ectopic expression of HLA-G by tumor cells provides them with an additional mechanism of escape from immunosurveillance by host cytotoxic effector mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of nonclassical HLA-G antigens in ex vivo human melanoma biopsies. HLA-G mRNA levels corresponding to both membrane-bound and soluble protein isoforms were analyzed in tumor specimens obtained from primary or metastatic melanomas of 23 patients. High levels of HLA-G transcription were detected in tumor specimens in 5 of 23 patients and found to be comparable in both lymph node and skin metastases. HLA-G mRNA transcript levels at tumor sites in 18 of these patients were compared with those in samples of their own healthy skin and were higher in the tumor tissue in 12 patients. Differential expression of mRNA transcripts corresponding to soluble and membrane-bound HLA-G was also observed in some tumor biopsies. HLA-G protein expression was detected in tumors that exhibited high levels of HLA-G transcription by immunofluorescence of frozen sections and Western blot analysis of both tumor and healthy skin biopsies, using anti-HLA-G-specific monoclonal antibodies. This work provides evidence that HLA-G gene transcription and protein expression can be up-regulated ex vivo in melanoma. Our finding that several of the tumors studied expressed high levels of HLA-G provides additional clues as to how a tumor can be selected in vivo to escape from cytotoxic antitumor responses, constituting a new parameter to be considered in the design of therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing antitumor immune responses.",

RB18A/MED1 chromosome localization on locus 17q12-q21.1 suggests its involvement in human cancers. We herein analyzed RB18A/MED1 expression in human melanoma cell lines. We found that RB18A/MED1 is either highly or weakly expressed in melanoma cells, depending on their respectively non or highly-tumorigenic phenotype. We therefore investigated the possible existence of a relationship between the RB18A/MED1 expression level and melanoma cell phenotype. For this purpose, we down-regulated RB18A/MED1 expression by transfecting melanoma cells with a RB18A/MED1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), specific to the 3'-untranslated region of native RB18A/MED1 RNA, already demonstrated to inhibit specifically RB18A/MED1 protein expression. A nonspecific (scrambled) siRNA was used as control. This RB18A/MED1 siRNA did not modify the expression of cathepsin L forms or lamin A/C, nor the secretion of procathepsin L and MMP2 in transfected cells. Analysis using a microarray membrane with 113 cancer-related genes, western blot and specific tests, demonstrated that RB18A/MED1 knockdown significantly inhibits tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 expression, and increases uPAR expression, two genes well known to be involved in melanoma cell invasion, through modifications of the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, RB18A/MED1 knockdown in melanoma cells in vitro increased their invasive properties, without modification of cell proliferation. Furthermore, RB18A/MED1 knockdown in vivo switched melanoma phenotype from non to strongly-tumorigenic in nude mice. Our data thus demonstrated for the first time that a decrease of RB18A/MED1 expression in human melanoma cells increases their tumorigenic phenotype.",

Successful invasion into distant organs by tumor cells must include attachment to microvessel endothelial cells, and degradation of basement membranes and extracellular matrix (ECM). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are essential and ubiquitous macromolecules associated with the cell surface and ECM of a wide range of cells and tissues. Heparanase (HPSE-1) is an ECM degradative enzyme, which degrades the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HSPG at specific intrachain sites. To investigate effects of changes in heparanase gene expression in metastatic melanoma cells, we constructed adenoviral vectors containing the full-length human HPSE-1 cDNA in both sense (Ad-S/hep) and antisense orientations (Ad-AS/hep). We found increased HPSE-1 expression and activity in melanoma cell lines following Ad-S/hep infection by Western blot analyses and specific HPSE-1 activity assay. Conversely, HPSE-1 content was significantly inhibited following infection with Ad-AS/Hep. Importantly, HPSE-1 modulation by these adenoviral constructs correlated with invasive cellular properties in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that HPSE-1 not only contributes to the invasive phenotype of melanoma cells, but also that the Ad-AS/hep-mediated inhibition of its enzymatic activity can be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of melanoma metastasis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The Hippo signaling pathway comprises a series of cytoplasmic tumor suppressor proteins including Merlin and the Lats1/2 and MST1/2 kinases, and is thought to play a critical role in determining the sizes of organs and tissues. The Hippo pathway is regulated upstream by extracellular mechanosensory signaling arising from cell shape and polarity, as well as by a variety of extracellular signaling molecules. When active, the pathway maintains the transcriptional activators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TAZ in phosphorylated forms in the cytoplasm, preventing cell proliferation. When the Hippo pathway is inactivated, YAP and TAZ are translocated to the nucleus and induce the expression of a variety of proteins concerned with entry into the cell division cycle, such as cyclin D1 and Fox M1, as well as the inhibition of apoptosis. The failure of the Hippo pathway has been implicated in the development of many different types of cancer but there is limited information available as to its involvement in melanoma. We hypothesize here firstly that the Hippo pathway is involved in maintaining density of cutaneous melanocytes on the basement membrane at the junction of the epidermis and the dermis, and secondly, that its function is disturbed in melanoma. We have analyzed a series of 23 low passage human melanoma lines as well as cultured normal melanoma, and find that melanocytes, as well as all melanoma cell lines examined express TAZ. Melanocytes and most melanoma lines also express YAP. E-cadherin, an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, and Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase regulated by the Hippo pathway, are expressed in melanocytes and in several melanoma cell lines. These observations, together with published evidence for the presence of Merlin, Lats1/2, and MST1/2 in melanocytes and melanoma cells, support the hypothesis that the Hippo pathway is an important component of melanocyte and melanoma behavior.",

The present study aimed to investigate the signaling pathways that mediated GA-induced inhibition of human malignant skin melanoma proliferation.;The study was conducted using A375 cells and the corresponding tumor transplanted in nude mice.;Incubation of A375 cells with 1-10 Î¼g/ml GA decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. GA concentration-dependently increased p66shc expression and intracellular ROS levels. GA also decreased the oxygen consumption rate and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in A375 cells. Experimental inhibition of p66shc by siRNA suppressed GA-induced increase of ROS, decrease of oxygen consumption rate, MMP and cell viability, whilst suppressing GA-induced increase of apoptosis. GA concentration-dependently upregulated p53 and Bax expression in A375 cells. GA also increased p53-TA-luciferase activity and p53-binding to Bax promoter, which was inhibited by Sip53. Experimental inhibition of p53 with Sip53 blocked GA-induced decrease of the oxygen consumption rate and cell viability, and blocked the increase of apoptosis. In tumor-bearing nude mice, GA notably inhibited tumor growth, and this action was suppressed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, and by PFT-Î±, a p53 inhibitor. In A375 tumors transplanted in nude mice, GA increased both p66shc and p53 expression. NAC and PFT-Î± treatment did not significantly affect p66shc expression in tumors grown in mice treated with GA. In contrast, both NAC and PFT-Î± treatment inhibited GA-induced p53 expression in mouse tumors.;Results provided novel preclinical insights into the chemotherapeutic use of GA by highlighting the importance of p66shc/ROS-p53/Bax pathways in the antitumor effect of GA in malignant melanoma.",

These antitumor CD8+ T cells recognize peptide antigens presented on the surface of tumor cells by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The MHC class I molecule is a heterodimer composed of an integral membrane glycoprotein designated the alpha chain and a noncovalently associated, soluble protein called beta2-microglobulin (beta 2m). Loss of beta 2m generally eliminates antigen recognition by antitumor CD8+ T cells.;We studied the loss of beta 2m as a potential means of tumor escape from immune recognition in a cohort of patients receiving immunotherapy.;We successfully grew 13 independent tumor cell cultures from tumor specimens obtained from 13 patients in a cohort of 40 consecutive patients undergoing immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma and for whom tumor specimens were available. These cell lines, as well as another melanoma cell line (called 1074mel) that had been derived from tumor obtained from a patient in a cytokine-gene therapy study, were characterized in vitro cytofluorometrically for MHC class I expression and by northern and western blot analyses for messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression, respectively, and ex vivo by immunohistochemistry.;After one melanoma cell line (1074mel) was found not to express functional beta 2m by cytofluorometric analysis, four (31%) of the 13 newly established melanoma cell lines were found to have an absolute lack of functional MHC class I expression. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from the five cell lines exhibiting no functional MHC class I expression showed that these cells contained normal levels of alpha-chain mRNA but variable levels of beta 2m mRNA. In addition, no immunoreactive beta 2m protein was detected by western blot analysis. When human beta 2m was transiently expressed with the use of a recombinant vaccinia virus, cell-surface MHC class I expression was reconstituted and the ability of these five cell lines to present endogenous antigens was restored. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections revealed a lack of immunoreactive MHC class I in vivo, supporting the notion that the in vitro observations were not artifactual. Furthermore, archival tumor sections obtained from patients prior to immunotherapy were available from three patients and were found to be beta 2m positive. This result was consistent with the hypothesis that loss of beta 2m resulted from immunotherapy.;These data suggest that the loss of beta 2m may be a mechanism whereby tumor cells can acquire immunoresistance.

J. Immunol. 136:2534). We report that C-resistant melanoma cells express a membrane proteinase that can cleave C3b, generating a cleavage product with a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa. The C3-cleaving proteinase was identified on the melanoma cells by its cross-reaction with antiserum to p57, a C3-cleaving proteinase previously isolated from human E membranes (C. Charriaut-Marlangue, M. Barel, R. Frade. 1986. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 140:1113). Preincubation of the C-resistant melanoma cells with anti-p57 IgG or their F(ab')2 fragments increased their susceptibility to complement killing from 25% to approximately 50% and reduced the rate of C3b cleavage and the amount of the 30-kDa fragment generated on the cells. Anti-p57 IgG stained C-resistant melanoma cells by indirect immunofluorescence and precipitated a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa. This membrane protein, termed p65, was not detectable on C-susceptible melanoma cells. Membrane extracts from C-resistant melanoma cells also showed C3-cleaving activity when incubated with purified C3 or C3b, similarly generating a C3 fragment of approximately 35 kDa. This fluid-phase C3 cleaving activity could be partially inhibited by anti-p57 IgG. These data suggest that p65 is a C3-cleaving proteinase, antigenically related to p57, that is expressed on C-resistant melanoma cells and responsible for the C resistance of these cells.

However, elucidating biological insights from these large data sets has been challenging. Previously, we identified a gene expression-based classification of primary uveal melanomas that accurately predicts metastatic death. Class 1 tumors have a low risk and class 2 tumors a high risk for metastatic death. Here, we used genes that discriminate these tumor classes to identify biological correlates of the aggressive class 2 signature. A search for Gene Ontology categories enriched in our class-discriminating gene list revealed a global down-regulation of neural crest and melanocyte-specific genes and an up-regulation of epithelial genes in class 2 tumors. Correspondingly, class 2 tumors exhibited epithelial features, such as polygonal cell morphology, up-regulation of the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin, colocalization of E-cadherin and beta-catenin to the plasma membrane, and formation of cell-cell adhesions and acinar structures. One of our top class-discriminating genes was the helix-loop-helix inhibitor ID2, which was strongly down-regulated in class 2 tumors. The class 2 phenotype could be recapitulated by eliminating Id2 in cultured class 1 human uveal melanoma cells and in a mouse ocular melanoma model. Id2 seemed to suppress the epithelial-like class 2 phenotype by inhibiting an activator of the E-cadherin promoter. Consequently, Id2 loss triggered up-regulation of E-cadherin, which in turn promoted anchorage-independent cell growth, a likely antecedent to metastasis. These findings reveal new roles for Id2 and E-cadherin in uveal melanoma progression, and they identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

We have studied the effects of a chemical conjugate of pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) and the antibody 9.2.27, which recognizes the high molecular weight melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA) expressed in most malignant melanomas and melanoma cell lines. We demonstrate that the 9.2.27PE immunotoxin (IT) induces cell death in malignant melanoma cells through protein synthesis inhibition followed by some morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis, like rounding up of cells, chromatin condensation and inactivation of PARP. Unlike previous results with the 425.3PE IT in breast cancer cells, we detected no depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane after 9.2.27PE IT treatment. This is likely due to the lack of strong activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. The lack of depolarization suggests that cytochrome c, a molecule that triggers activation of caspase-3, was retained within the mitochondria. In addition, the protein level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 did not decrease in contrast to other antiapoptotic molecules belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis and the Bcl-2 family. This suggests that Bcl-2 may play a role in maintaining the mitochondrial membrane integrity in the 9.2.27PE-treated cells.

Masking of CD59 by 2.5 micrograms/ml of the anti-CD59 mAb YTH53.1 induced or enhanced C-mediated lysis of melanoma cells sensitized with 2.5 micrograms/ml of mAb R24; the latter phenomenon was found to be directly correlated (r > 0.865, p < 0.01) with levels of cell membrane CD59. CD59 is bound to melanoma cells by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor: treatment of C-resistant melanoma cells Mel 97, by increasing doses of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), progressively decreased cell-surface expression of CD59 and increased C-mediated lysis of cells sensitized with mAb R24. Staining of 38 benign and malignant lesions of melanocytic origin by mAb YTH53.1 demonstrated that CD59 is consistently expressed in vivo and confirmed the heterogeneous expression detected in vitro. Our data, altogether, demonstrate that CD59 is the main restriction factor of C-mediated lysis of melanoma cells and that levels of CD59 may account for their differential resistance to C-mediated lysis. The analysis of the levels of CD59 could represent an useful strategy in selecting melanoma patients who may benefit from immunotherapeutic treatment(s) that trigger C activation.",

In this in vitro study the potential anti-tumoral activity of tea tree oil, distilled from Melaleuca alternifolia, was analyzed against human melanoma M14 WT cells and their drug-resistant counterparts, M14 adriamicin-resistant cells. Both sensitive and resistant cells were grown in the presence of tea tree oil at concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 0.03%. Both the complex oil (tea tree oil) and its main active component terpinen-4-ol were able to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis of melanoma cells and this effect was more evident in the resistant variant cell population. Freeze-fracturing and scanning electron microscopy analyses suggested that the effect of the crude oil and of the terpinen-4-ol was mediated by their interaction with plasma membrane and subsequent reorganization of membrane lipids. In conclusion, tea tree oil and terpinen-4-ol are able to impair the growth of human M14 melanoma cells and appear to be more effective on their resistant variants, which express high levels of P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane, overcoming resistance to caspase-dependent apoptosis exerted by P-glycoprotein-positive tumor cells.",

The mechanisms for upregulation of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule during melanoma progression are still poorly understood. In this study, we show further evidence that melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. Using a combination of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter assays and DNA mobility shift experiments, we investigated the role played by three putative melanoma cell adhesion molecule regulatory elements, namely the initiator sequence, the SCA element, and the ASp element. The SCA and the ASp boxes can potentially interact with the transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2. Sp1 binding to both sites was confirmed, but only the SCA sequence could form a complex with AP-2. AP-2-driven downregulation of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule promoter, however, did not depend only on a functional SCA element. The pyrimidine-rich CTCACTTG initiator, which overlaps the RNA start site, was essential for promoter function and was shown to interact with proteins related to basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. Binding in nonmetastatic melanoma cells was induced by cAMP. In metastatic cells, however, binding was constitutive, but could be markedly decreased upon treatment with phorbol esters. As melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression is modulated by cAMP and phorbol ester signaling, these results suggest that the initiator is the central element that mediates cAMP and phorbol ester sensitivity and initiates melanoma cell adhesion molecule overexpression in melanomas.",

Unfortunately, the disease is generally resistant to standard chemotherapy, and surgical excision remains the best treatment option whenever possible. However, complete spontaneous regression of melanoma has been observed in some patients, a phenomenon thought to be mediated by the immune system. This has stimulated attempts to manipulate the immune system for therapeutic purposes. Vaccination is a form of active specific immunotherapy, such that the response against the tumor is actively generated by the patient's immune system, and is directed against a particular cellular target or specific membrane antigen. Numerous approaches to vaccination for melanoma have been investigated, and have become more complex as our understanding of anti-tumor immunity has increased. Vaccines have been shown to induce measurable immunologic responses that may be correlated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma. Large phase III clinical trials using peptide, ganglioside, and whole-cell tumor antigens are ongoing. Although anti-tumor vaccination has shown promising results in patients with melanoma, to date no vaccine has been approved for routine therapy of melanoma. Recently, a phase III trial evaluating the Canvaxin whole-cell vaccine in stage IV melanoma was halted because of a low likelihood of significant benefit.

In the present study we have investigated possible mechanisms by which recombinant human interferons, IFN-alpha, -beta and -gamma, alter the antigenic profile of long- and short-term human melanoma cultures. IFN-alpha and -beta induced similar changes in the synthesis, expression and shedding of two TAAs, a HMW-MAA and a Cyt-MAA, in the established melanoma cell line Colo 38, whereas IFN-gamma exerted a differential effect on these melanoma associated antigens. Moreover, IFN-gamma was relatively more effective than IFN-alpha or -beta in upregulating the synthesis, expression and shedding of class I MHC antigens. At the same time a dramatic differential effect of the interferons was observed with class II MHC antigens. IFN-alpha or -beta induced a modest increase in the synthesis and expression of these antigens, whereas IFN-gamma was greater than 3-fold more active in inducing the synthesis and expression of DR/DP antigens and greater than 4- and greater than 10-fold more effective in increasing the synthesis and expression, respectively, of DQ antigens. Analysis of the levels of cytoplasmic mRNA for the DR-alpha and DQ-beta genes indicated no significant difference between IFN-alpha, beta or -gamma treated cells suggesting that IFN-gamma enhancement of the synthesis of DR and DQ antigens may occur at a posttranscriptional level. In the case of a newly established human melanoma cell line (MG-3) IFN-gamma enhanced the synthesis but not the expression of DR antigens and did not alter either the synthesis or expression of DQ antigens. Our studies indicate that the effects of interferons on the antigenic phenotype of melanoma cells will vary depending on the type of interferon employed, the antigen monitored and the target cell studied. In addition, it is also apparent that some of the biosynthetic steps involved in regulating the synthesis, expression and shedding of antigens may be coordinately regulated in some melanoma cells, whereas these processes may be under independent control in other melanoma populations.",

Endocytosis is thought to play an essential role in the catabolism of HA due to the intracellular compartmentalization of the HA degrading hyaluronidase enzymes. Previous investigations have shown that keratinocytes, chondrocytes and breast tumor cell lines endocytose HA via the cell surface glycoprotein, CD44. However, other cell types endocytose HA using a CD44-independent mechanism that remains to be defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate HA endocytosis in B16-F10 melanoma cells. We found that B16-F10 melanoma cells expressed CD44 on their surfaces. Unexpectedly, CD44 did not play a role in the endocytosis of HA. Electron microscopy studies revealed that B16-F10 melanoma cells exhibited membrane ruffling, a characteristic feature of macropinocytosis, only after incubating the cells with the HA co-polymer. Moreover, B16-F10 melanoma cells endocytosed HA via macropinocytosis as assessed by drug inhibition studies and the co-localization of fluorescently labeled HA with fluorescent tracers under confocal microscopy. Based on these results, we conclude that induced macropinocytosis may provide a previously unrecognized avenue for HA endocytosis in some cell types.",

After adjustment by Cox regression for tumor size, cell type, microvascular loops and networks, and microvascular density, a clinically meaningful 0.15 difference in 10-year melanoma-specific survival persisted.;The presence of ezrin immunoreactivity in uveal malignant melanoma is associated with higher mortality and with two independent high-risk characteristics: microvascular density and number of infiltrating macrophages.

However, emerging cell biology data suggest a novel cdk-independent cytoplasmic function of p27 in cell migration. Here, we find cytoplasmic p27 in 70% of invasive and metastatic melanomas. In contrast, no cytoplasmic p27 was detected in noninvasive, basement membrane-confined melanoma in situ, suggesting a late oncogenic role for cytoplasmic p27 in metastasis. Targeted cytoplasmic expression of wild-type or non-cdk-binding p27 at subphysiologic levels induced melanoma motility and resulted in numerous metastases to lymph node, lung, and peritoneum.

Kindlin-3 is expressed in platelets, hematopoietic cells, and endothelial cells. Kindlin-3 promotes integrin activation, clustering and outside-in signaling. Aberrant expression of kindlin-3 was reported in melanoma and breast cancer. Intriguingly, kindlin-3 has been reported to either positively or negatively regulate cancer cell metastasis. In this study, we sought to clarify the expression of kindlin-3 in melanoma cells and its role in melanoma metastasis. Two widely used metastatic mouse and human melanoma cell lines B16-F10 and M10, respectively, were examined and found to lack kindlin-3 mRNA and protein expression. When kindlin-3 was ectopically expressed in these cells, cell migration was markedly reduced. These are attributed to aberrant Rac1 and RhoA activation and overt membrane ruffling. Our data demonstrate for the first time that despite its well established role as a positive regulator of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, aberrant expression of kindlin-3 could lead to imbalanced RhoGTPases signaling that impedes rather than promotes cell migration.",

The surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) and major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules was higher in DCs pulsed with AbOmpA alone or with a combination of B16F10 cell lysates than that of DCs pulsed with B16F10 cell lysates.

The zonula occludens (ZO) protein-1 is a membrane-associated component of both the tight and adherens junctions found at sites of cell-cell contact. In most cancers, levels of ZO-1 are typically down-regulated, leading to increased motility. Here we report the novel observation that ZO-1 expression is up-regulated in melanoma cells and is located at adherens junctions between melanoma cells and fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies showed co-localization of ZO-1 with N-cadherin. Down-regulation of ZO-1 in melanoma cells through RNA interference produced marked changes in cell morphology--leading to a less-dendritic, more rounded phenotype. Consistent with a role in N-cadherin-based adhesion, RNAi-treated melanoma cells were less adherent and invasive when grown in a collagen gel. These data provide the first evidence that increased ZO-1 expression in melanoma contributes to the oncogenic behavior of this tumor and further illustrate that protein products of genes, such as ZO-1, can function in either a pro- or anti-oncogenic manner when expressed in different cellular contexts.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Failure of current therapeutic modalities to treat melanoma remains a challenge for clinical and experimental oncology. The aggressive growth and apoptotic resistance of this tumor are mediated, in part, by aberrantly activated protein kinase B/Akt (PKB). In many cells, PKB signaling depends on integrity of cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains (rafts). However, it is still unclear if rafts support deregulated PKB activity in melanoma. In this study, ablation of rafts in murine (B16BL6-8, JB/RH1) and human (GA) melanoma lines by cholesterol-chelating methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) reduced levels of constitutively active PKB in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while reconstitution of microdomains restored PKB activity. PKB was sensitive to the membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid tetra (acetocymethyl) ester and to the calmodulin antagonist N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphtalenesulfonamide (W7) implying the contribution of Ca2+ signaling to PKB deregulation. Indeed, malignant and apoptosis-resistant clone of B16BL6 melanoma (B16BL6-8) displayed significantly higher [Ca2+](i) and store-operated Ca2+ influx (SOC) relative to non-malignant apoptosis-sensitive B16BL6 clone (Kb30) expressing barely detectable basal levels of active PKB. Raft ablation in B16BL6-8 cells robustly inhibited SOC and decreased [Ca2+](i) to levels comparable with those detected in Kb30 cells. Treating cells by PKB-inhibiting doses of M beta CD dramatically impaired their apoptotic resistance and capacity to generate tumors. Furthermore, weekly intraperitoneal injections of M beta CD to mice grafted with melanoma cells at doses of 300 and 800 mg/kg significantly attenuated tumor development. Our data implicate membrane rafts in enhancing the resistance of melanoma to apoptosis and indicate that targeting raft microdomains is a potentially effective strategy to cure this frequently fatal form of cancer.",

However, as shown in the present study and several other studies melanoma cells usually do not express classical ERs. In the present study we investigated whether the cytotoxic effect of TAM on melanoma cells could depend on interference with the expression or function of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a plasma membrane receptor important for cell survival in this tumor cell type. Several melanoma cell lines were included in the analysis. Administration of TAM at a concentration of 15 microm or more resulted in cell death of the melanoma cells within 48 h. TAM treatment was correlated to a slight to moderate inhibition of IGF-1 binding to IGF-1R. Since it has been reported that TAM can increase the release of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) we then investigated whether this mechanism could underly the decreased IGF-1 binding. However, we could demonstrate that the amount of released IGFBPs were unchanged or decreased in TAM-treated cells. Whereas TAM did not have any strong effect on IGF-1 binding and the expression of IGF-1R at the cell surface, it was was found to efficently block tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R beta-subunit. Taken together, our data suggest that TAM-induced cytotoxicity of malignant melanoma cells can be due to inactivation of IGF-1R.",

B16-F10 metastatic murine melanoma cells and a derived clone (B16-F10L) were prelabeled with 0.1 muCi/ml of [14C]thymidine for 20-24 h in serum-free medium at 37 degrees C. Following incubation, fetal bovine serum was added to a concentration of 5 per cent, and the cells were allowed to grow to confluency for the next 24-28 h. The labeled cells were seeded onto amniotic membranes situated in Membrane Invasion Culture System (MICS) chambers at a density of 2.5 X 10(4) per well. At various times points, radioactivity of tumor cells that completely traversed the membrane was determined using an under-the-membrane sampling method. The average percent invasion demonstrated by the B16-F10 line was 2.75 per cent, and 3.65 per cent exhibited by the B16-F10L cell line after 48-53 h in vitro. Since it was apparent that some variability in thickness existed among membrane samples, a morphological analysis was performed on five sectors of a three-inch-diameter sample from four different placentae. Differences and similarities in BM thickness within the same sector were noted by this technique and could possibly contribute to some variability observed in tumor cell invasion in this model. Another parameter examined was the proliferation of tumor cells in the upper and lower wells of the MICS chambers. By 48 h, approximately 32.1 per cent of the B16-F10 cell line as well as the clone had replicated in the upper wells associated with the BMs compared with a 32.9 per cent replication in the lower wells, which reaffirmed the viability of the tumor cells under experimental conditions and insured similarly replicating populations of cells. In order to quantify the invasiveness of radiolabeled tumor cells accurately through a biological membranous barrier, the proper concentration of cells must be used, tumor cell heterogeneity should be taken into consideration, the technique of sampling radiolabeled invasive cells should be critically analysed, and thickness of the membranous barrier should all be considered as possible important factors in the quantitative analyses.",

The three agents were found to inhibit the proliferation of B16 melanoma cells. Only tiazofurin, as expected, induced a significant decrease in GTP levels. Lovastatin and H-7 altered p21 subcellular localization. They reduced membrane expression of p21 ras, while increasing its expression in the cytosol. Following tiazofurin treatment a trend towards increased membranal p21 was observed. These results suggest that p21 is a target for the action of signal transduction inhibitors. However, the relationship between growth inhibition and altered p21 expression is not yet clear.",

In the present study Hsp70 membrane expression was studied on primary malignant melanomas, melanoma metastases, melanocytes, human skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes, together with expression of the melanoma-associated markers Mel-1, Mel-2 and Mel-5, major histocompatibility complex class I and the fibroblast-specific marker ASO2. As previously shown, fibroblasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy human volunteers were found to be negative for Hsp70 and for the melanoma-associated markers Mel-1, Mel-2 and Mel-5. Human melanocytes from healthy human donors were also negative for Hsp70, but were positive for Mel-1 and Mel-5. Independent of the Clark's level, all the malignant melanomas (n = 9) and metastases (n = 11) exhibited were positive for both Mel-1 and Mel-2. The primary melanomas could be divided into two groups according to their Hsp70 and Mel-5 expression pattern: those with an Hsp70-negative and a Mel-5-positive phenotype (-/+) (five out of nine), and those with an Hsp70-positive and a Mel-5-negative phenotype (+/-) (four out of nine). All the melanoma metastases (n = 11) had an Hsp70-positive, Mel-5-negative phenotype (+/-). These data provide the first hint that the marker combination Hsp70 positive/Mel-5 negative might be useful in estimating the metastatic potential of a melanoma.

In particular, our group has recently demonstrated that PAF receptor antagonists can effectively inhibit the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells in nude mice. Furthermore, we showed that PAF stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 in metastatic melanoma cells, which resulted in overexpression of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. Our data indicate that PAF acts as a promoter of melanoma metastasis in vivo.

Previous reports have suggested that CD63 may play an important role in inhibiting melanoma progression, and this was supported by our studies showing that CD63 was associated with suppression of the growth of melanoma in nude mice. Recently, we and others have shown that CD63 may form noncovalent associations with beta1 integrins, which suggests that the function of CD63 may be related to that of integrins. To further explore the role of CD63 in melanoma, we transfected CD63 into a highly motile, CD63-negative melanoma cell line, KM3, which was shown to express alpha(v)beta5 as the predominant integrin with only trace amounts of beta1 integrins. Following transfection, CD63 was shown to associate with beta1 integrins, and beta1 expression appeared to be up-regulated. Cell motility in serum-containing media was markedly suppressed following transfection of CD63. This inhibition was potentiated by mAbs to CD63, and correlated with the level of CD63 expression. The CD63-transfected, but not the untransfected, melanoma cells showed increased adhesion and migration on the beta1 substrates, fibronectin, laminin, and collagen, whereas rates of migration were similar on the beta5 substrate, vitronectin. These results show that CD63 is involved in regulation of the motility of melanoma cells and their adhesion and migration on substrates associated with beta1 integrins. We suggest they provide further insights into the role of CD63 in tumor progression.",

In this state of homeostasis, keratinocytes control melanocyte growth and behaviour through a complex system of paracrine growth factors and cell-cell adhesion molecules. Alteration of this delicate homeostatic balance and can lead to altered expression of cell-cell adhesion and cell communication molecules and to the development of melanoma. Melanoma cells escape from this control by keratinocytes through three major mechanisms: (1) down-regulation of receptors important for communication with keratinocytes such as E-cadherin, P-cadherin, desmoglein and connexins, which is achieved through growth factors produced by fibroblasts or keratinocytes; (2) up-regulation of receptors and signalling molecules not found on melanocytes but important for melanoma-melanoma and melanoma-fibroblast interactions such as N-cadherin, Mel-CAM, and zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1); (3) loss of anchorage to the basement membrane because of an altered expression of the extracellular-matrix binding integrin family.

Interference with MMP-2 expression further confirms its important role during this invasion. Vav proteins are guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases that regulate actin dynamics and gene expression. We show that melanoma cells express Vav1 and Vav2, which are activated by CXCL12 involving Jak activity. Blocking Vav expression by RNA interference results in impaired activation of Rac and Rho by CXCL12 and in a remarkable inhibition of CXCL12-promoted invasion. Importantly, up-regulation of MT1-MMP expression by CXCL12, a mechanism contributing to melanoma cell invasion, is blocked by knocking down Vav expression or by inhibiting Jak.

No differences in nm23 expression were observed between ND and LT cells, and nm23 expression varied between different isolates. Previously, we showed that metastatic potential of 1-ND cells decreases and is not altered in 1-LT cells after prolonged in vitro cell passage; however, nm23 expression is equivalently increased by 2-fold. In 2-ND and 2-LT cells, expression of nm23 is not different at higher in vitro cell passage. Expression of nm23 decreased about 2-fold when phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was removed from Mel-ab cells, which induces these cells to become quiescent. Although membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) activity decreased after prolonged PMA treatment in all cells, neither nm23 expression nor proliferation of ND and LT cells was affected by PMA.

Here, we analyzed the expression of RECK, TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, MT1MMP, MMP2, and MMP9 in two publicly available melanoma microarray datasets and in a panel of human melanoma cell lines. We found that RECK is downregulated in malignant melanoma, accompanied by upregulation of MT1MMP and TIMP2. In both datasets, we observed that the group of samples displaying higher RECK levels show lower median expression levels of MT1MMP and TIMP2 and higher levels of TIMP3. When tested in a sample-wise manner, these correlations were statistically significant. Inverse correlations between RECK, MT1MMP, and TIMP2 were verified in a panel of human melanoma cell lines and in a further reduced model that includes a pair of matched primary tumor-derived and metastasis-derived cell lines.

Routine histological examination showed that the lesion was composed of diffusely scattered atypical cells with round, spindle-shaped and irregular nuclei and scanty fibrous connective tissue. A fascicular arrangement was often found in the lesion, and no cancer nests were observed. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated positive staining for S-100 protein in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Electron microscopic examination revealed that cell organelles were abundant, and an interrupted basal lamina was often found along the cell membrane. The preliminary diagnosis was a non-epithelial malignant tumor. After surgery, histological examination of metastases in lymph nodes from the submandibular region revealed that the tumor cells contained melanin pigment in the cytoplasm, as confirmed by Masson's melanin stain. The final pathological diagnosis was therefore amelanotic melanoma. Immunohistochemical staining for S-100 protein may be useful for differential diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma in conjunction with electron microscopic examination.",

The melanoma nature of the cells growing in MoAb 225.28S coated dishes is indicated by the specific reactivity with anti-HMW-MAA MoAb, by its detection in spent culture medium and by morphological criteria. The specificity of the procedure is proven by the lack of growth of cells seeded in fetal calf serum (FCS) coated dishes, as well as of cells lacking the HMW-MAA in MoAb 225.28S coated dishes. The adherence of melanoma cells to plastic dishes is influenced by the concentration of the plastic bound MoAb 225.28S and by the incubation time. Melanoma cells isolated by adherence to MoAb 225.28S coated plates do not display any detectable change in their growth curve and colony forming ability.

        "Doc_abstract":"Emergence of the invasive phenotype is a key event in the progression of human melanoma from benign proliferative lesions to malignant lesions. Recently we successfully selected in vivo from a poorly metastatic M4Beu. human melanoma cell line two variants (7GP and T1P26) that generate a higher frequency of spontaneous metastases to the lungs into immune-suppressed neonatal rats. Both cell lines showed no significant differences in the integrin profile of the subunits analyzed except for beta3, which was reduced to a background level in metastatic variants. To investigate how these variant sublines of human melanomas manage to sustain growth in the absence of alpha(v)beta3, a subtractive immunization approach was used to elicit host antibody response against cell surface proteins expressed on metastatic variants. In this study, a new monoclonal antibody (MoAb), LY1, that is highly specific for the 7GP and T1P26 variants, was isolated. LY1 identifies a membrane protein of Mr 55,000 on melanoma variants with epitopes that were resistant to sugar-cleaving enzymes. Immunostaining cells from variants by LY1 showed that staining is distributed to the cell periphery with high labeling intensity at the cell-to-cell contact points. This MoAb significantly inhibited invasion of metastatic variants through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) in vitro. Moreover, tumor growth of melanoma variants was dramatically affected in vivo with this MoAb. In vitro studies indicate that the LY1 MoAb does not inhibit chemotactic migration of the metastatic variants, the adhesion of tumor cells to vitronectin, collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin, or cell proliferation. Expression of this antigen is high in human striated muscle, heart, spleen, brain, and lung and absent in kidney, liver, and pancreas. Using 59 fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues of human melanomas and nevi, LY1-reactive cells were not observed in melanocytes, nevi, or radial growth phase primary melanomas. In sharp contrast, LY1 selectively stained melanocytes derived from the vertical growth phase of many primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas. These results provide evidence that the Mr 55,000 protein expressed by selected variants with increased metastatic properties in vivo plays a functionally important role in determining metastasis. This molecule may represent a new metastatic risk marker in human melanoma and may be of biological importance in the identification of fatal metastatic subpopulations that have acquired competence for metastasis production.",

        "Doc_abstract":"An understanding of signaling pathways is a basic requirement for the treatment of melanoma. Currently, kinases are at the center of melanoma therapies. According to our research, additional alternative molecules are equally important for development of melanoma. In this regard, cancer progression is, among other factors, driven by an altered adhesion via cadherins. For instance, the de-regulated expression of the adhesion molecule T-cadherin is found in various cancer types, including melanoma, and influences migration and invasion. T-cadherin is thought to affect cellular function largely through its signaling and not its adhesion properties because the molecule is anchored into the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. However, detailed knowledge about the consequences of the loss of T-cadherin in melanoma is currently lacking. For this reason, we were interested in assessing which signaling pathways are initiated by T-cadherin. The tumor growth of subcutaneously injected T-cadherin-positive melanoma cells was diminished compared with T-cadherin-negative cells in nude mice. The difference in tumor volume was not due to decreased proliferation but rather due to increased apoptosis. After the expression of T-cadherin was induced, we detected V-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) and FoxO3a hypophosphorylation accompanied by the downregulation of the antiapoptotic molecules BCL-2, BCL-x and Clusterin. Furthermore, we detected a diminished transcriptional activity of CREB and AP-1. We demonstrated that T-cadherin functions as a pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor that antagonizes AKT/CREB/AP-1/FoxO3a signaling, whereas NFÎºB, TCF/LEF and mTOR are not part of the T-cadherin signaling pathway. Notably, we found that the restoration of T-cadherin in melanoma cells causes sensitization to apoptosis induced by CD95/Fas antibody CH-11.",

This pro-apoptotic activity was not detectable with resiquimod, a closely related structural analogue whose pro-inflammatory activity is even greater than that of imiquimod. Unresponsiveness of some melanoma metastases to imiquimod in vivo corresponded to resistance towards imiquimod-induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. At the molecular level, the pro-apoptotic activity of imiquimod was independent of membrane-bound death receptors, but depended on Bcl-2 expression as demonstrated by overexpression of Bcl-2 in melanoma cells.

Here, we demonstrate that activation of ET(B)R by endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 leads to loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and associated catenin proteins and gain of N-cadherin expression. Exposure of melanoma cells to ET-1 leads to a 60% inhibition in intercellular communication by inducing phosphorylation of gap junctional protein connexin 43. Additionally, activation of the ET(B)R pathway increases alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(2)beta(1) integrin expression and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, membrane type-1-MMP activation, and tissue inhibitor MMP-2 secretion. The ET(B)R pathway results into the downstream activation of focal adhesion kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways, which lead to enhanced cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and MMP-dependent invasion. The small molecule A-192621, an orally bioavailable nonpeptide ET(B)R antagonist, significantly inhibits melanoma growth in nude mice.

Cells interact with the microenvironment via complex autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Proteolytic enzymes in melanoma may activate or release growth factors from the microenvironment or act directly on the microenvironment itself, thereby facilitating angiogenesis or tumor cell migration. This review summarizes recent findings regarding the expression, structure and function of proteolytic enzymes at or near the cell surface in cell-cell and cell-stroma interactions during melanoma progression. Cell-surface (membrane) peptidases are a multi-functional group of ectoenzymes that have been implicated in the control of growth and differentiation of many cellular systems.

Herein, we found that the invasive growth of melanoma cells in three-dimensional-Matrigel/collagen-I matrices is dramatically increased on their co-culture with embryonic or adult skin fibroblasts. Studies with fluorescent-labeled cells revealed that the melanoma cells first activate the fibroblasts, which then take the lead in invasion. To identify the physiologically relevant invasion-related proteases involved, we performed genome-wide microarray analyses of invasive human melanomas and benign nevi; we found up-regulation of cysteine cathepsins B and L, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and -9, and urokinase- and tissue-type plasminogen activators. The mRNA levels of cathepsins B/L and plasminogen activators, but not MMPs, correlated with metastasis. The invasiveness/growth of the melanoma cells with fibroblasts was inhibited by cell membrane-permeable inhibitors of cathepsins B/L, but not by wide-spectrum inhibitors of MMPs. The IHC analysis of primary melanomas and benign nevi revealed cathepsin B to be predominantly expressed by melanoma cells and cathepsin L to be predominantly expressed by the tumor-associated fibroblasts surrounding the invading melanoma cells. Finally, cathepsin B regulated TGF-Î² production/signaling, which was required for the activation of fibroblasts and their promotion of the invasive growth of melanoma cells.

Melanoma sera were autologous to melanoma membrane preparations. The isolated immunoglobulins showed immunoreactivity against antigens prepared from melanoma, sarcoma, and carcinoma cells by complement fixation but not against antigens prepared from normal human liver and lung tissues. Absorption of the isolated immunoglobulins with rabbit anti-human immunoglobulin immunobeads resulted in complete elimination of the complement-fixing antibody titer in one instance, whereas reduction occurred in other samples. Similar absorption with rabbit anti-human immunoglobulin M immunobeads resulted in reduction, but not complete elimination, of the antibody titers against target tumor cell preparations. These results suggest the presence of immunoreactive immunoglobulin G in all immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin M in some. Absorption of the isolated immunoglobulins with cultured sarcoma cells reduced but did not completely abolish antibody activity against autologous or allogeneic melanoma target antigen, whereas it did completely abolish activity against sarcoma target antigen. However, absorption with cultured allogeneic melanoma cells abolished the antibody activity against melanoma as well as sarcoma target antigens. The antibody titers of the isolated immunoglobulins were not affected by absorption with cultured lymphoblastoid cells.

This is clearly a departure from all previously described cases, in which a leptomeningeal (pial-arachnoidal) origin was either defined or assumed. Clinically, this case was remarkable in its rarity, its presentation as a cerebellopontine angle syndrome, and its occurrence in a Negro, a race in which melanomas are uncommon. Ultrastructurally, the tumor did demonstrate the presence of basement membrane abnormalities and numerous endothelial fenestrations. However, it was found to be made up of a homogenous cell population, consisting only of electron-lucent, melanin-laden cells. The mixed cell population noted previously in a primary leptomeningeal melanoma was not found in this tumor. In view of the fact that this patient continues to do well 1 1/2 years after operation, with no evidence of tumor recurrence, it is suggested that a homogenous cell population noted on electron microscopy could indicate a better prognosis. In addition, it may also indicate a pachymeningeal rather than a leptomeningeal origin for the tumor.

In this study we present evidence that MT1-MMP plays a key role for the in vitro invasiveness of malignant melanoma. Melanoma cell lines secreted latent MMP-2 when cultured on plastic. However, when cells were grown in floating type I collagen lattices, only high invasive melanoma cells activated proMMP-2. Activation could be inhibited by antibodies against MT1-MMP, by addition of recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 and by inhibition of MT1-MMP cleavage. MT1-MMP protein was detected as an inactive protein in all cell lines cultured as monolayers, whereas in collagen gels, active MT1-MMP protein was detected in the membranes of both high and low invasive melanoma cells. Production of TIMP-2 was about 10-fold higher in low invasive cells as compared with high invasive melanoma cells and was further increased in the low invasive cells upon contact to collagen. Thus, in melanoma cells TIMP-2 expression levels might regulate MT1-MMP-mediated activation of proMMP-2. High invasive melanoma cells displayed increased in vitro invasiveness, which was inhibited by TIMP-2. These data indicate the importance of these enzymes for the invasion processes and support a role for MT1-MMP as an activator of proMMP-2 in malignant melanoma.",

Plasma membrane lipid rafts contribute to the compartmentalization of signaling complexes thereby regulating their function, but how they may affect the properties of adhesion molecules remains elusive. In this study, we addressed the question whether lipid rafts in melanoma cells may contribute to the compartmentalization of N-cadherin. We show that a fraction of N-cadherin in a complex with catenins is associated with cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains in aggressive melanoma cells in vitro and experimental melanomas in vivo. Partitioning of N-cadherin in membrane rafts is not modulated by growth factors and signaling pathways relevant to melanoma progression, is not necessary for cell-cell junctions' establishment or maintenance, and is not affected by cell-cell junctions' and actin cytoskeleton disruption. These results reveal that two independent pools of N-cadherin exist on melanoma cell surface: one pool is independent of lipid rafts and is engaged in cell-cell junctions, while a second pool is localized in membrane rafts and does not participate in cell-cell adhesions. Targeting to membrane rafts may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism regulating N-cadherin function in melanoma cells.",

Limited proteolytic digestion of melanoma cells with trypsin or with pronase rendered these cells refractory to lysis by the chimpanzee antiserum and complement. Longer periods of incubation of higher concentrations of enzyme caused an increased sensitivity to lysis. Digestion of melanoma cells with neuraminidase apparently exposed antigens reactive with natural antibodies in rabbit complement because cells so treated had a marked increase in sensitivity to cytolysis. Absorption of the complement with either neuraminidase-treated human melanoma cells or washed human spleen cells prior to its use in the cytotoxicity assay removed this activity. When absorbed complement was used, neuraminidase had no noticeable effect on the expression of malanoma TAA. These results suggest that proteolytic digestion of melanoma cells may prove to be a useful means of solubilizing TAA. The spontaneous release of melanoma cell membrane TAA was studied. Protein precipitated by (NH4)2SO4 from four of six samples of tissue culture medium used to feed malanoma cell lines contained significant antigenic activity compared to a control \"antigen\" preparation, whereas one preparation contained only limited TAA activity. One melanoma cell line that apparently failed to release TAA into the culture medium had previously become nonreactive with the chimpanzee antiserum. From these data, we conclude that melanoma cells growing in tissue culture rapidly release large amounts of TAA into the culture media and, as a result, the spent culture medium may be a good source for obtaining TAA for further study. The significance of these results is discussed.",

Previous studies show that upon cell contact, various membrane-associated proteins, such as Ras-family proteins, transfer from B to T and NK lymphocytes. Mutations in RAS genes that encode constitutively active, GTP-bound, oncoproteins are rather common in human cancers; for instance, melanoma. Cancer immunoediting has been postulated to contribute to the elimination of malignant melanoma. Thus, we asked whether Ras oncoproteins can transfer from melanoma to T cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and subsequently induce functional effects in the adopting T cells. To explore this issue, we genetically engineered an HLA-A2(+) melanoma cell line, MEL526, to express GFP or GFP-tagged H-Ras mutants stably. In this study, we show by an in vitro coculture system that GFP-tagged H-Ras, but not GFP, transfers from MEL526 to T cells and localizes to the inner aspect of their plasma membrane. This cell-contact-dependent process was increased by TCR stimulation and did not require strict Ag specificity. Importantly, we found a positive correlation between the levels of the acquired constitutively active H-RasG12V and ERK1/2 phosphorylation within the adopting TILs. We also show a significant increase in IFN-Î³ production and cytotoxic activity in TILs that acquired H-RasG12V compared to TILs that acquired a different H-Ras mutant. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a hitherto unknown phenomenon of intercellular transfer of Ras oncoproteins from melanoma to TILs that consequently augments their effector functions.",

However, some cancer cell types including malignant melanoma cells are resistant             to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Here, we show that diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a garlic             organosulfur compound, sensitizes melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis while             sparing normal cells. DATS also potentiates apoptosis induced by agonistic antibodies             against death receptors (DR) 4 and DR5. The amplification of DR-mediated apoptosis             was associated with increased mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and caspase-3/7             activation. However, these events were not sufficient for full sensitization.             TRAIL also induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by the activation             of X-box-binding protein 1 and caspase-12 and DATS poten-tiated both events. Moreover,             inhibition of caspase-12, but not caspase-4, abolished the amplification of apoptosis,             indicating that ER stress plays a crucial role. On the other hand, DATS and/or             TRAIL induced minimal apoptosis and caspase-12 activation in melanocytes despite             their substantial expression of DR4 and DR5 on the cell surface. Our data suggest             that DATS amplifies death ligand-induced melanoma cell death by disrupting their             adaptation to ER-mediated death pathway.

DPPIV has numerous functions including involvement in T-cell activation, cell adhesion, digestion of proline containing peptides in the kidney and intestines, HIV infection and apoptosis, and regulation of tumorigenicity in certain melanoma cells. Constitutively expressed on numerous epithelial cell types, DPPIV is often disregulated in a variety of human malignancies. The most striking evidence of DPPIV down-regulation is found in transformed melanocytes. where nearly 100% of melanomas lack DPPIV expression. We have identified DPPIV as a gene that can alter the invasive potential of a number of melanoma cell lines. By transfecting the full-length cDNA of DPPIV, we have established stable melanoma cell lines that express comparable levels of the DPPIV protein as normal epidermal melanocytes. Matrigel invasion assays were utilized to study the effects of DPPIV expression on the invasive potential of these cells. The parental and vector transfectants readily migrated across the Matrigel while the invasiveness of DPPIV transfected cells was reduced by greater than 75%. The effects on cellular invasion are not attributed to overall growth characteristics, as both DPPIV expressing and non-expressing cells behave comparably in culture. We have also constructed mutants of DPPIV that lack either the extra-cellular serine protease activity or the six amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Both mutants were stably expressed in melanoma cells. Matrigel invasion assays performed with cells expressing the two mutant forms of the protein revealed phenotypic effects similar to wild type function. In this study. we have demonstrated that expression of a proteolytically active form of the DPPIV protein inhibits the invasiveness of malignant melanoma cell lines lacking endogenous DPPIV expression.

Methodologies were developed to visualize these receptors by fluorescence microscopy. Multiple copies (10-20) of both [Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH, a superpotent analog of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and a fluorophore, were conjugated to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Incubation in the presence of the multivalent macromolecular conjugate (FITC-PVA-MSH) resulted in binding of human epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes and human melanoma cells (both melanotic and amelanotic) to the fluorescent conjugate. Binding of the conjugate to the cells exhibited a unique cluster pattern (capping) suggesting a receptor internalization related phenomenon. Most importantly, every cell of every melanoma cell line, melanotic or amelanotic, possessed receptors as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Since the cells were not synchronized, some binding apparently took place during all phases of the cell cycle. Therefore, receptor expression appears not to be cell-cycle dependent. Specificity of binding of FITC-PVA-MSH was demonstrated by several studies. (i) Binding of the conjugate to melanoma cells could be blocked by prior incubation of the cells in the presence of the unconjugated hormone analog; [Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH. (ii) The macromolecular conjugate lacking bound ligand (FITC-PVA) did not bind to the melanoma cells. (iii) Another peptide, a substance-P analog, attached to the substrate (FITC-PVA-SP) failed to bind to the cells. (iv) With the exception of keratinocytes, other cells of nonmelanocyte origin (e.g., fibroblasts, spleen, liver, kidney cells, and mammary cancer cells, lung cancer cells) did not bind to the conjugate. Thus, cell-specific melanotropin receptors appear to be characteristic cell surface markers of epidermal melanocytes, keratinocytes, and melanoma cells. In several human melanoma cell lines these receptors appeared to be functional since [Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH stimulated tyrosinase activity. Fluorescent melanotropin conjugates might prove useful in determining whether all human melanoma (primary and metastatic) tumors possess such receptors. These receptors might then provide targets for melanotropic peptides for the identification, localization, and chemotherapy of melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Uveal melanoma is the most frequent primary intraocular tumor in the adult population. This malignancy has a high mortality rate and responds poorly to existing chemotherapy. Recently, the tumor environment has been found to exert a profound influence on drug response through cell interaction with components from the extracellular matrix (ECM). In the present study, we investigated whether individual components from the ECM may affect cell survival and/or cell death induced by the cytotoxic agent cisplatin on the SP6.5 uveal melanoma cell line. Tumor cells were shown by immunofluorescence analyses to be surrounded by the ECM proteins fibronectin (FN), type IV collagen (CIV) and laminin (LM), both at the primary and metastatic sites. Binding of SP6.5 cells to FN, LM and CIV is primarily dictated by the expression of membrane bound integrins from the beta1 family as revealed by cell adhesion assays conducted on ECM-coated culture plates. Analysis of cell death by flow cytometry demonstrated that culturing SP6.5 cells in the presence of FN, CIV and LM, substantially reduced the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis after cisplatin treatment when compared with those seeded on a non-permissive matrix. These results suggest that adhesion of the SP6.5 uveal melanoma cells to the ECM proteins FN, CIV and LM might therefore confer resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. The cellular resistance induced by the ECM proteins toward cisplatin could explain in part the local recurrence of metastasis derived from uveal melanoma often observed clinically after chemotherapy.",

MT1-MMP is a membrane-associated matrix metalloproteinase that controls pericellular proteolysis and is an important, invasion-promoting, pro-tumorigenic MMP in cancer. We show that deregulation of MT1-MMP expression happens as early as the transition from nevus to primary melanoma and continues to increase during melanoma progression. Furthermore, MT1-MMP expression is associated with poor melanoma patient outcome, underscoring a pivotal role of MT1-MMP in melanoma pathogenesis. We demonstrate that MT1-MMP is directly required for melanoma cells to metastasize, as cells deprived of MT1-MMP fail to form distant metastasis in an orthotopic mouse melanoma model. We show that MT1-MMP affects cell invasion by activating its target MMP2. Importantly, we demonstrate, for the first time, that activation of MMP2 by MT1-MMP is required to sustain RAC1 activity and promote MT1-MMP-dependent cell motility. These data highlight a novel MT1-MMP/MMP2/RAC1 signaling axis in melanoma that may represent an intriguing molecular target for the treatment of invasive melanoma. ",

Among them, the TGF-beta family is one of the most intriguing because it has been reported either to decrease or promote cancer progression. In the present paper, we studied the effect of TGF-beta1 in a mouse melanoma model. In vivo, TGF-beta1 inhibited tumor growth after subcutaneous injection of B16F1 cells in syngenic mice. In vitro, TGF-beta1 did not alter B16F1 cell proliferation, but strongly decreased their migration through Matrigel-coated membranes. The protease production was analyzed by zymography, Western blot, or RT-PCR. MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expression were not altered by TGF-beta1. In contrast, TGF-beta1 triggered a large decrease of uPA and tPA, as well as a decrease of uPA and uPAR mRNAs. By Western blot and RT-PCR analyses, TGF-beta1 was shown to induce a strong increase of PAI-1 synthesis. Collectively, these results suggest that TGF-beta1 may inhibit melanoma tumor growth by specifically decreasing plasmin activity of tumor cells and play a protective role during the earliest stages of tumor progression.",

Analysis by biochemical and immunologic methods indicated that the isolated HR9 extracellular matrix was composed of laminin, type IV collagen, entactin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans--all basement membrane-specific macromolecules. Ultrastructurally, the extracellular matrix elaborated by the HR9 cells appears as a meshwork of finely fibrillar material. B16 melanoma cells were found to adhere rapidly to the isolated HR9 matrix, but significant penetration into the structure was not observed. However, the melanoma cells did induce an extensive solubilization of 35S-sulfate-labeled heparan sulfate to fragments that were approximately one-third the size of the intact heparan sulfate chains. Only the B16 melanoma sublines exhibited this unique pattern of proteoglycan degradation, which suggests that they possess an endoglycosidase specific for heparan sulfate chains. B16 melanoma cells seeded onto HR9 matrices labeled with [1H]leucine or [3H]proline caused no detectable increase in matrix protein solubilization compared to controls.

We found that suppression of SPARC expression in human melanoma cells compromised cell migration, adhesion, cytoskeleton structure, and cell size. These changes involved the Akt/mTOR pathway. Re-expression of SPARC or protein addition restored all the cell features. Suppression of SPARC expression was associated with increased Rac1-GTP levels and its membrane localization. Expression of the dominant negative mutant of Rac1 counteracted almost all the changes observed in SPARC-deficient cells. Overall, these data suggest that most of the SPARC-mediated effects occurred mainly through the blockade of Rac1 activity. ",

The seprase and Gelatinase A activities of these cell lines were also investigated. Seprase and active gelatinase A are found in cell membranes of LOX and RPM17951 cells but not those of SKMEL28 cells. Experiments using anti-seprase monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with a cell fractionation technique indicate that seprase consists of M(r) 97,000 polypeptides and is enriched on the ventral membrane of LOX in contact with planar extracellular matrix substratum. Confocal microscopy further substantiates our biochemical findings that seprase, as well as Gelatinase A, is localized on invadopodia membranes with a 6-fold increase of seprase and 4-fold increase of Gelatinase A intensity over the level expressed on dorsal membranes. In addition, LOX cells expressing higher levels of seprase at the cell surface, as selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, are significantly more degradative than LOX cells with lower seprase expression. Taken together, our data show a concordance between seprase and Gelatinase A expression on the cell surface at invadopodia and the matrix-degrading activity of human malignant melanoma cells.

LAK cells were generated by stimulation of non-adherent peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from human donors with recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2). The selection of target cells was based on GM2 content and included 11 human melanoma cell lines and 2 human leukemia lines. Using a single-cell binding assay, LAK cell binding to target lines expressing high levels of GM2 was significantly greater than to those expressing minimum GM2. This cell-binding was specifically inhibited by addition of purified GM2 but not by other gangliosides. LAK-melanoma cell-binding was also specifically inhibited by anti-GM2 monoclonal antibody (MAb). For further analysis LAK cell lysis of melanoma target cells expressing various amounts of GM2 was assessed. A significant correlation occurred with GM2 expression and LAK cell lysis (p less than 0.025; r = 0.623). Three other gangliosides commonly expressed on human melanoma, GM3, GD3 and GD2, had no correlation with LAK cell lysis.

SLs inhibited the proliferation of three human melanoma cell lines: SK-28, 624 mel and 1363 mel in a dose-dependent manner. We further investigated SLs mechanism of action using SK-28 as a representative cell line model. SLs caused cell-cycle arrest at G(2)/M, accompanied by the appearance of a sub-G0 fraction, indicative of apoptotic cell death. Induction of apoptosis was further confirmed by changes in membrane phospholipids, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) and by detection of Caspase-3 activity. Rapid inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 (Thr14 and Tyr15) was seen early after treatment, followed by a later decrease in the expression level of both Cyclin b1 and Cdc2. Induction of p53 and p21(waf1) proteins and phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 were also detected early after treatment. The anti-apoptotic proteins, p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and Survivin were reduced in a dose-dependent manner.

The direct correlation between serum MIA levels of patients with progressing melanomas and tumor load supports a role for MIA as a melanoma progression factor. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), activating ras mutation, or loss of p53 function on MIA expression and release from melanoma cells. We previously showed that transfection of a mutant constitutively active ras into the melanoma cell line, WM35, induces a phenotypic change from radial to vertical growth, exhibiting increased proliferation and migration. Here, we report that MIA release was elevated in a ras-transfected cell line. In addition, loss of functional p53, using a dominant negative construct, substantially lowered the level of MIA release compared to control. UVR stimulated release of MIA into the extracellular compartment in both the control and ras-transfected cell lines. In addition, MIA mRNA was increased following UVR in all cell lines tested. By inducing either apoptosis or necrosis, we were able to confirm that MIA protein is not released from cells due to cell death alone. We have identified a transcriptional effect of UVR on MIA expression and have shown that release of MIA protein is dependent upon functional p53. We propose that UVR-induced production and release of MIA may promote the detachment of radial and vertical growth phase melanomas from basement membrane or matrix proteins, serving as a unique progression mechanism for melanoma.",

The elevated expression of PKCÎµ in advanced metastatic melanoma results in the increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2 on threonine 52, which causes its nuclear localization and confers its oncogenic activities. The nuclear-to-mitochondrial translocation of ATF2 following genotoxic stress promotes apoptosis, a function that is largely lost in melanoma cells, due to its confined nuclear localization. Therefore, promoting the nuclear export of ATF2, which sensitizes melanoma cells to apoptosis, represents a novel therapeutic modality.;We conducted a pilot high-throughput screen of 3,800 compounds to identify small molecules that promote melanoma cell death by inducing the cytoplasmic localization of ATF2. The imaging-based ATF2 translocation assay was conducted using UACC903 melanoma cells that stably express doxycycline-inducible GFP-ATF2.;We identified two compounds (SBI-0089410 and SBI-0087702) that promoted the cytoplasmic localization of ATF2, reduced cell viability, inhibited colony formation, cell motility, and anchorage-free growth, and increased mitochondrial membrane permeability. SBI-0089410 inhibited the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-l3-acetate (TPA)-induced membrane translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, whereas both compounds decreased ATF2 phosphorylation by PKCÎµ and ATF2 transcriptional activity. Overexpression of either constitutively active PKCÎµ or phosphomimic mutant ATF2(T52E) attenuated the cellular effects of the compounds.;The imaging-based high-throughput screen provides a proof-of-concept for the identification of small molecules that block the oncogenic addiction to PKCÎµ signaling by promoting ATF2 nuclear export, resulting in mitochondrial membrane leakage and melanoma cell death.",

The lesions included banal nevi, junctional and compound nevi with melanocytic dysplasia, nontumorigenic radial growth phase melanoma, tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanoma, and metastatic melanoma. We found intense membrane staining in normal melanocytes and mast cells. Staining in compound nevi was strongest in junctional and superficial dermal components, whereas dermal nevi showed weak reactivity. Dysplastic nevi stained strongly, particularly in junctional cells. In melanoma, strong reactivity was most prominent in radial growth phase disease, but there was little or no staining in vertical growth phase and metastatic melanomas. In summary, c-kit protein is expressed in normal melanocytes, benign nevi, dysplastic nevi and nontumorigenic melanoma, but expression is lost in tumorigenic primary melanomas and metastases.

Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections with CD44 isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies to the CD44 standard (s) and variant isoforms (v) v5 and v6. CD44s, v5, and v6 were strongly expressed in a membranous pattern in SM in situ, early invasive SM, and in uninvolved respiratory/squamous epithelium. In invasive SM, membranous CD44s expression was identified in a large proportion of melanoma cells. Membranous staining of CD44v5 and v6 was lost in invasive SM, independently of the histological subtype. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining was observed focally in invasive SM and loss of cytoplasmic expression of CD44v6 and v5 was associated with advanced tumour stage in the linear-by-linear association test (p = 0.042 and 0.066, respectively). CD44s may not be important for malignant transformation, as it is expressed in both benign and malignant melanocytes.

To determine whether these changes reflect the differential expression of HLA antigens and MAA by melanocytes at different stages of differentiation, we have studied the effect of the reversible induction of differentiation by fibroblast interferon (interferon beta) and/or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) on the expression of HLA antigens and MAA by the melanoma cell lines DU-2, FO-1 and HO-1. The three melanoma cell lines differed in their sensitivity to the differentiating and antiproliferative activity of these two compounds and displayed an increased growth suppression and induction of differentiation, when incubated with the combination of TPA and interferon beta. Incubation of the three melanoma cell lines with interferon beta, TPA or their combination resulted in a differential modulation of the expression of membrane-bound high-molecular-mass melanoma-associated antigen, 115-kDa MAA, 100-kDa MAA, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, HLA class I antigens and gene products of the HLA-D region. Each melanoma cell line displayed a unique pattern of antigenic modulation when exposed to the two differentiating agents alone or in combination. No direct relationship was found between the effects of interferon beta and/or TPA on the growth and differentiation of the three melanoma cell lines and the expression of HLA antigens or the MAA evaluated in the present study. These findings argue against a direct role of any of the antigens tested in the reversible induction of human melanoma cell differentiation in the in vitro system.",

Inherited mutations or auto-antibodies targeting collagen XVII cause blistering skin disease. Collagen XVII is down-regulated in mature keratinocytes but re-expressed in skin cancer. By recently detecting collagen XVII in melanocyte hyperplasia, here we tested its expression in benign and malignant melanocytic tumors using endodomain and ectodomain selective antibodies. We found the full-length collagen XVII protein in proliferating tissue melanocytes, basal keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma whereas resting melanocytes were negative. Furthermore, the cell-residual 60Â kDa endodomain was exclusively detected in 62/79 primary and 15/18 metastatic melanomas, 8/9 melanoma cell lines, HT199 metastatic melanoma xenografts and atypical nests in 8/63 dysplastic nevi. The rest of 19 nevi including common, blue and Spitz subtypes were also negative. In line with the defective ectodomain, sequencing of COL17A1 gene revealed aberrations in the ectodomain coding region including point mutations. Collagen XVII immunoreaction-stained spindle cell melanomas, showed partly overlapping profiles with those of S100B, Melan A and HMB45. It was concentrated at vertical melanoma fronts and statistically associated with invasive phenotype. Antibody targeting the extracellular aa507-529 terminus of collagen XVII endodomain promoted apoptosis and cell adhesion, while inhibiting proliferation in HT199 cells. These results suggest that the accumulation of collagen XVII endodomain in melanocytic tumors is associated with malignant transformation to be a potential marker of malignancy and a target for antibody-induced melanoma apoptosis.",

Furthermore, the value of the FIF method in both classification and diagnosis of pigment-producing tumor cells after certain forms of therapy is emphasized. Experimental studies with nevus cell nevi have gained important findings on the histogenesis of nevus cells. These results indicate that nevus cells are possibly derivatives of normal melanocytes, for nevus cells in junctional nests still show a dendritic pattern like melanocytes. Based on photocatamnestic studies it can be concluded that the initial growth of melanoma may be very protracted. There are many indications that pigment spots which had sometimes existed for decades and were mistaken for nevi were malignant from the very beginning and had developed from the melanocytes of the epidermis. The development of melanomas on nevus cell nevi seems to be an exception. However, in these cases, too, malignant transformation occurs in the melanocytes of the epidermis overlying the nevus rather than in the nevus cells. This is confirmed by the findings obtained by the FIF method; under certain conditions dendritic cells may be demonstrated in all types of melanoma, which gives support to the unitary melanocytogenic origin of the tumor. However, typical dendritic tumor cells in great numbers are only visible in lentigo maligna. In the other tumors (e.g., SSM or NM), the shape of the tumor cells and the growth of the melanoma are probably dependent on the varying degree of cell dedifferentiation, the ability or unability for horizontal spreading growth as well as on terrain factors. However, there is every reason to believe that melanoma cells originate from melanocytes of the skin (or mucous membranes).",

In a hypoxic environment, tumor cells generally up-regulate glycolysis and, therefore, generate more lactate that must be expelled from the cell through proton transporters to prevent intracellular acidosis. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) is a major proton transporter in mammalian cells that transports monocarboxylates, such as lactate and pyruvate, together with a proton across the plasma membrane. Melanocytic neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs, but the prognosis is highly site-dependent. In this study, 50 oral canine melanomas, which were subdivided into 3 histologic subtypes, and 17 ocular canine melanocytic neoplasms (14 melanocytomas and 3 melanomas) were used to examine and compare MCT1 expression. Immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal chicken anti-rat MCT1 antibody showed that most oral melanoma exhibited cell membrane staining, although there were no significant differences observed among the 3 histologic subtypes. In contrast, the majority of ocular melanocytic tumors were not immunoreactive. Additionally, we documented the presence of a 45-kDa band in cell membrane protein Western blots, and sequencing of a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction band of expected size confirmed its identity as a partial canine MCT1 transcript in 3 oral tumors. Increased MCT1 expression in oral melanomas compared with ocular melanocytic tumors may reflect the very different biology between these tumors in dogs. These results are the first to document canine MCT1 expression in canine tumors and suggest that increased MCT1 expression may provide a potential therapeutic target for oral melanoma.",

During log growth from Day 1 (1.2 +/- 0.08 X 10(4) cells/cm2) to Day 4 (20.4 +/- 3.01 X 10(4) cells/cm2), antigen density increased from 4.09 +/- 0.29 to 6.86 +/- 0.29. By Day 8 (26.5 +/- 2.86 X 10(4) cells/cm2) when the cells had been confluent for 3 days, antigen density decreased to 2.54 +/- 0.26 which was significantly lower than other days measured (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that tumor cell proliferation and cell density can modulate antigen expression in this system and, therefore, this may be a useful model to study tumor cell escape from immunotherapy.",

The function of GMR in these nonhematopoietic cells is unknown. We studied the function of GMR in human melanoma cell lines. Six of seven cell lines tested (clones 1-5 and 3.44 of SK-MEL-131, SK-MEL-188, SK-MEL-23, SK-MEL-22, and SK-MEL-22A) expressed mRNA encoding the membrane-bound and soluble isoforms of the alpha subunit of the GMR. Melanoma cell lines in early stages of differentiation expressed the largest quantities of alpha-subunit mRNA. Although five of these lines expressed trace levels of mRNA encoding the beta subunit of the GMR, Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data derived from three of the cell lines showed that they expressed only low-affinity GMR. Clones 3.44 and 1-5 of SK-MEL-131, and SK-MEL-188 cells expressed receptors with a dissociation constant (kd) for GM-CSF in the following ranges: 0.7 to 0.8, 1.2 to 1.8, and 0.4 to 0.8 nmol/L, respectively. GM-CSF stimulated glucose uptake in four of the melanoma cell lines expressing the alpha subunit, presumably through facilitative glucose transporters, as uptake was blocked by cytochalasin B but not cytochalasin E. Stimulation of glucose uptake was transient, with maximum stimulation occurring at approximately 30 minutes in the presence of 1 nmol/L GM-CSF. GM-CSF stimulated glucose uptake 1.4- to 2.0-fold but did not stimulate cell proliferation. These results suggest a metabolic role for the low-affinity GMR in melanoma cell lines and indicate that the alpha subunit of the GMR can signal for increased glucose uptake in nonhematopoietic tumor cells.",

Roughley, F.X. Maquart, Y. Wegrowski, Identification of beta1 integrin as mediator of melanoma cell adhesion to lumican, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 365 (2008) 266-272]. The aim of the present work was to study beta1 integrin, focal adhesion complexes, actin distribution and expression in the presence of lumican substratum in comparison to type I collagen or fibronectin substrata in A375 human melanoma cells. The protein distribution was investigated by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. In parallel, their expression was evaluated by Western immunoblotting and Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR analyses. The interaction of melanoma cells with the lumican substratum resulted in heterogeneous distribution of beta1 integrin on cell membrane after 24h of seeding. Concomitantly, a reorganization of actin stress fibers and a significant decrease in vinculin immunostaining at focal adhesion complexes were observed. No alteration of the expression was detected at protein and mRNA levels. However, a cytosolic accumulation of vinculin focal adhesion protein was observed on lumican substratum by confocal microscopy. Moreover, vinculin expression was significantly increased in cytosolic fractions in comparison to cells seeded on type I collagen or fibronectin substrata. Our results suggest that lumican induces an alteration of the link between actin filaments and beta1 integrin, characterized by a cytosolic accumulation of vinculin focal adhesion protein, which could lead to a destabilization of focal adhesion complexes. In addition, focal adhesion kinase phosphorylated at tyrosine-397 (pFAK) was significantly decreased. Therefore, the cytoskeleton remodeling and the decreased pFAK phosphorylation induced by lumican in melanoma cells might explain, at least in part, the anti-invasive effect of this SLRP.",

Logarithmic and stationary growth phases in culture were clearly distinguished by nuclear cell staining with the proliferation marker Ki-67. PKC-beta I and -beta II were expressed exclusively in normal melanocytes but not in melanoma cells, whereas PKC-gamma was not found in any of the cultures studied. Low PKC-delta, -epsilon and -zeta mRNA levels were detected by RT-PCR in proliferating melanoma cells and higher in confluent non-proliferating cells, whereas levels of PKC-alpha mRNA remained rather stable. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting revealed accordingly low expression of PKC-alpha, -delta, -epsilon, and -zeta in the logarithmic growth phase of melanoma cells, with subsequent increase of expression and of membrane association in the stationary phase. Only weak differences were detected between the growth phases in normal melanocytes for the respective PKC isozymes, except for membrane-associated PKC-beta I and -beta II which were clearly elevated in confluent melanocyte cultures.

However, little is known about the regulation of CREB and ATF-1 activities and their phosphorylation within the tumor microenvironment. We analyzed the effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent phospholipid mediator of inflammation, for its ability to activate CREB and ATF-1 in eight cultured human melanoma cell lines, and we found that PAF receptor (PAFR) was expressed in all eight lines. In metastatic melanoma cell lines, PAF induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation via a PAFR-mediated signal transduction mechanism that required pertussis toxin-insensitive Galphaq protein and adenylate cyclase activity and was antagonized by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and p38 MAPK inhibitors. Addition of PAF to metastatic A375SM cells stimulated CRE-dependent transcription, as observed in a luciferase reporter assay, without increasing the CRE DNA binding capacity of CREB. Furthermore, PAF stimulated the gelatinase activity of MMP-2 by activating transcription and MMP-2 expression. MMP-2 activation correlated with the PAF-induced increase in the expression of an MMP-2 activator, membrane type 1 MMP. PAF-induced expression of pro-MMP-2 was causally related to PAF-induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation; it was prevented by PAFR antagonist and inhibitors of p38 MAPK and protein kinase A and was abrogated upon quenching of CREB and ATF-1 activities by forced overexpression of a dominant-negative form of CREB. PAF-induced MMP-2 activation was also down-regulated by p38 MAPK and protein kinase A inhibitors. Finally, PAFR antagonist PCA4248 inhibited the development of A375SM lung metastasis in nude mice. This result indicated that PAF acts as a promoter of melanoma metastasis in vivo. We proposed that metastatic melanoma cells overexpressing CREB/ATF-1 are better equipped than nonmetastatic cells to respond to PAF within the tumor microenvironment.",

Variants of murine B16 melanoma having different metastatic potentials (in the order BL6 greater than or equal to F10>F1>WA4) have been characterized by the same decreasing order of cell surface G(M3) expression level, relative adhesiveness to nonactivated ECs, and relative degree of G(M3)-dependent adhesion to Gg3Cer- or LacCer-coated plates. Degree of integrin-dependent cell adhesion and adhesion to IL-1-activated ECs was similar for BL6, F10, and F1. These results suggest that metastatic potential of these B16 variants is closely dependent on relative adhesion to nonactivated ECs, which is based on G(M3)-Gg3Cer or G(M3)-LacCer interaction. This possibility has been supported by further studies showing that blocking of G(M3)-dependent melanoma adhesion by mu M-order concentrations of G(M3) or Gg3Cer in liposomes, or by sialidase treatment of melanoma cells, strongly inhibited BL6 metastasis to lung. Paragloboside or sialylparagloboside did not affect G(M3)-dependent BL6 cell adhesion and did not inhibit metastasis. Spontaneous metastasis from subcutaneously-grown tumors was significantly reduced if G(M3)- or Gg3Cer-liposomes were intravenously injected during tumor growth.

Galectin-1 is a laminin binding protein that recognizes poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains on this major basement membrane glycoprotein. In this study, we analyzed the possibility that galectin-1 could modulate interactions between human melanoma cells and laminin. We demonstrated that A375 and A2058 cell lines express galectin-1 both intracellularly and on the cell surface. In an in vitro assay, recombinant galectin-1 increased melanoma cell attachment to laminin in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was abolished by lactose. Anti-galectin-1 inhibited adhesion of melanoma cells to laminin in a dose-dependent fashion. However, neither galectin-1 nor anti-galectin-1 antibody affected melanoma cell spreading on laminin in vitro. These data indicate that galectin-1 might participate in melanoma cell adhesion to laminin and therefore could be a modulator of invasion and metastasis.",

Melanoma cells at initial stages of the disease show reduction or loss of E-cadherin expression, but recovery of its expression is frequently found at advanced phases. We overexpressed E-cadherin in the highly invasive BRO lung metastatic cell melanoma cell line to investigate whether it could influence CXCL12-promoted cell invasion. Overexpression of E-cadherin led to defective invasion of melanoma cells across Matrigel and type I collagen in response to CXCL12. A decrease in individual cell migration directionality toward the chemokine and reduced adhesion accounted for the impaired invasion. A p190RhoGAP-dependent inhibition of RhoA activation was responsible for the impairment in chemokine-stimulated E-cadherin melanoma transfectant invasion. Furthermore, we show that p190RhoGAP and p120ctn associated predominantly on the plasma membrane of cells overexpressing E-cadherin, and that E-cadherin-bound p120ctn contributed to RhoA inactivation by favoring p190RhoGAP-RhoA association. These results suggest that melanoma cells at advanced stages of the disease could have reduced metastatic potency in response to chemotactic stimuli compared with cells lacking E-cadherin, and the results indicate that p190RhoGAP is a central molecule controlling melanoma cell invasion.",

In this study, we demonstrate that low levels of adriamycin, a widely used anticancer drug, can inhibit the invasion of highly metastatic K1735-M2 mouse melanoma cells in vitro through a reconstituted basement membrane extract. Adriamycin-induced inhibition of melanoma cell invasion occurred at levels of the drug (i.e. 1 ng/ml) that did not inhibit tumor cell growth, suggesting that the observed inhibition in tumor cell invasion was not due to the well-documented ability of adriamycin to interfere with DNA and/or RNA synthesis. Rather, these studies indicated that adriamycin-induced inhibition of melanoma cell invasion was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the ability of adriamycin-treated tumor cells to migrate in response to several isolated ECM components including fibronectin, laminin and basement membrane (type IV) collagen. The decreased migration of adriamycin-treated tumor cells was not accompanied by a decrease in the adhesion or spreading of the adriamycin-treated cells on substrata coated with these ECM components. Instead, adriamycin-treated cells actually exhibited a slightly increased propensity (compared to untreated control cells) to adhere on fibronectin-, laminin-, and type IV collagen-coated substrata. Additionally, adriamycin treatment caused a dramatic increase in focal contact formation by these melanoma cells, as assessed by fluorescent microscopy of actin and vinculin. In addition to providing a useful model for which to study the molecular and cellular basis for focal contact formation, these results further emphasize the results of several other investigators that have suggested an important role for focal contacts in modulating tumor cell motility, invasion and metastasis.",

In order to explore the prognostic significance of these molecules in melanoma, total SCF, SCF splice variants and c-Kit expression were studied in normal skin melanocytes and in 11 different melanoma cell lines, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nine of the 11 melanoma cell lines expressed SCF-1 mRNA, only two of them SCF-2, and these two also SCF-1. Coexpression of both SCF-1 and c-Kit was noted in five cell lines, and only one cell line as well as normal melanocytes expressed both SCF-1 and SCF-2 as well as c-Kit. Corresponding results were obtained on immunocytochemical staining. Of three exemplary melanoma cell lines studied, two expressing SCF mRNA also released SCF spontaneously and on stimulation, whereas the line lacking SCF and c-kit mRNA (SK-Mel-23) failed to do so. These data demonstrate thus that melanoma cell lines, particularly those known to metastasize in vivo, lose the ability to express SCF-2 mRNA, suggesting that this molecule may serve, next to c-Kit, as a prognostic marker for malignant melanoma.",

This seemed to correlate with relative resistance of freshly isolated melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We show in this study that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer, tunicamycin, selectively up-regulated the cell surface expression of TRAIL-R2, but not other members of the TNF receptor family, and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cultured melanoma cells and fresh melanoma isolates. Tunicamycin-mediated sensitization of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was associated with increased activation of the caspase cascade and reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and was inhibited by a recombinant TRAIL-R2/Fc chimeric protein. Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 on the melanoma cell surface was associated with increased transcription of TRAIL-R2 and its total protein levels. Two signaling pathways of the ER stress-induced unfolded protein response mediated by inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1alpha (IRE1alpha) and activation of transcription factor 6 (ATF6), respectively, seemed to be involved. In one melanoma line, there was clear evidence of activation of the IRE1alpha pathway, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of IRE1alpha substantially reduced the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2. Similarly, there was evidence for the activation of the ATF6 pathway, and siRNA knockdown of ATF6 had a delayed effect on TRAIL-R2 expression in one but not another melanoma cell line. Moreover, the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein seemed to be involved in the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by tunicamycin, but its role varied between different melanoma lines. Taken together, our results suggest that agents that induce ER stress may enhance TRAIL-R2 expression and increase the therapeutic response to TRAIL in melanoma.",

In M14 cells, recombinant IL2 (36 pM) induces the down modulation of ICAM-1 expression at the surface of M14 cells.

The determination of PAF synthesized by IFN gamma-stimulated tumor cells revealed that 70% of newly synthesized PAF was released into growth media, while the remaining 30% was associated with the cell bodies. An experimental protocol based on the use of WEB 2086, a PAF receptorial antagonist, was designed to explore which of the two fractions of PAF synthesized by IFN gamma-stimulated F10-M3 cells (released into the growth medium or associated with the cell bodies) is essential to their capacity to migrate through Matrigel. We found that the PAF secreted into growth medium is the fraction responsible for the enhanced invasiveness of melanoma cells stimulated with IFN gamma. We also investigated whether motility of melanoma cells is stimulated by IFN gamma, and, if so, whether PAF is involved in this effect. We found that WEB 2086 prevented the remodeling of stress fibers, examined as an index of cell motility, that we observed in F10-M3 cells stimulated with IFN gamma. Furthermore, the observation that PAF receptor is expressed in IFN gamma-stimulated melanoma cells suggests that the invasive phenotype (e.g. migration through a reconstituted basement membrane and motility) promoted by PAF is based on an autocrine mechanism.

In a previous study, we determined the expression of a short truncated 50 kDa form of P-cadherin only consisting of the N-terminal part in malignant melanoma. Further analysis revealed that this short 50 kDa form of P-cadherin representing the N-terminal, extracellular region, is secreted by melanoma cells in contrast to the membrane bound form in melanocytes. In order to define the functional relevance of expression of the 50 kDa P-cadherin variant in malignant melanoma, antisense P-cadherin cell clones were generated. The clones in which P-cadherin expression is reduced show no changes in proliferation or in attachment-independent growth when compared to controls. However, a strong reduction of migratory and invasive properties was observed in these cells, suggesting that truncated P-cadherin promotes melanoma cell invasion and migration and therefore has an important role in the progression of malignant melanoma. Functionally, the secreted form of P-cadherin could play a role as regulator of the homophilic interaction between P-cadherin molecules by antagonizing their biological role acting as a dominant negative form to interrupt cell-cell attachment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We previously demonstrated that membrane vesicles shed by the F10 variant of the murine B16 melanoma cell line inhibited the induction by interferon-gamma (IFN) of murine macrophage immune response region-associated (Ia) antigen expression. In this paper we present evidence that the inhibition of macrophage Ia antigen expression is a selective effect of vesicles and characterize its temporal requirements. Membrane vesicles shed from F10 cells did not affect the expression of macrophage H-2K or H-2D antigens under conditions shown to profoundly inhibit Ia antigen expression. Similarly, the induction of plasminogen activator and interleukin 1 from macrophages was not inhibited by the vesicles. The vesicles did not measurably decrease total cellular RNA or protein synthesis. Macrophages were sensitive to the inhibitory effects of the vesicles during the induction and maintenance phases of Ia expression. Pretreatment of macrophages with vesicles before culture with IFN did not reduce the induction of Ia. The rate of decline of Ia expression after removal of IFN was unaffected by the presence of vesicles. Removal of vesicles from cultures of IFN-treated macrophages resulted in only a partial recovery of Ia expression, suggesting that the inhibition of Ia expression may be a slowly reversible process. The selective and partially reversible inhibition of Ia expression by vesicles shed from the plasma membrane of tumor cells is a possible mechanism whereby tumor-bearing hosts may become immunocompromised.",

We investigated the feasibility of targeting melanin, an intracellular melanocyte pigment, to deliver cytotoxic radiation to human melanoma cells in vivo by using a melanin-binding mAb (6D2). Nude mice bearing MNT1 pigmented human melanoma tumors were treated with mAb 6D2 labeled with 1.5 mCi (1 Ci = 37 GBq) of the beta-emitter 188-Rhenium (188Re) and manifested inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival. mAb 6D2 bound tumor melanin and demonstrated no crossreactivity with normal melanized tissues in black mice. The mechanism of melanin targeting involved Ab binding to extracellular melanin released during tumor cell turnover or to dying cells with permeable membranes. In this approach, the cytotoxic radiation emanating from labeled Ab bound to melanin is presumably delivered by \"crossfire\" effect to the adjacent viable tumor cells. Our results establish the feasibility of targeting melanin released from dead melanoma cells in tumors with radiolabeled Abs to achieve a therapeutic effect. In contrast to conventional tumor antigens, melanin is insoluble, resistant to degradation, and can be expected to accumulate in targeted tissues, suggesting that the efficacy of therapy could increase with each subsequent treatment cycle.",

Laminin-332 was not detected. In functional assays, laminin-111, laminin-332, and laminin-511, but not laminin-211 and laminin-411, strongly promoted haptotactic cell migration either constitutively or following stimulation with insulin-like growth factors. Both placenta and recombinant laminin-511 preparations were highly active, and the isolated recombinant IVa domain of LMÎ±5 also promoted cell migration. Function-blocking antibodies in cell migration assays revealed Î±6Î²1 integrin as the major receptor for laminin-111, and both Î±3Î²1 and Î±6Î²1 integrins for laminin-332 and laminin-511. In contrast, isolated LMÎ±5 IVa domain-promoted melanoma cell migration was largely mediated via Î±VÎ²3 integrin and inhibited by RGD peptides. Given the ubiquitous expression of Î±5 laminins in melanoma cells and in melanoma-target tissues/anatomical structures, as well as the strong migration-promoting activity of these laminin isoforms, the Î±5 laminins emerge as putative primary extracellular matrix mediators of melanoma invasion and metastasis via Î±3Î²1 and other integrin receptors.",

In this study, it was demonstrated that stellettin A (1), obtained from Geodia japonica, inhibited the growth of B16F10 murine melanoma cells by the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins. Immunoblotting analysis revealed abnormal glycosylation patterns of two melanoma marker proteins, tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1, and the retention of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Compound 1 induced the upregulation of the unfolded protein chaperone, glucose-regulated protein 78, in a dose-dependent manner. Increase of autophagosome-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) in a membrane-bound form (LC3II) and its immunofluorescence co-localization with tyrosinase suggest the possible removal of deglycosylated and unfolded proteins by autophagy of the cells.

The events resulting in tumour cell killing by lymphocytic effectors have not been completely clarified, and the same target cell determinants regulating responsiveness to immune cytolysis have not yet been identified. Indeed, changes in the differentiative status of leukemia cells as well as in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens have been described to modulate sensitivity to cytotoxic effectors; moreover surface expression of adhesion factors or extracellular matrix proteins by the cancer cells can promote the activation of the cytolytic effectors and has been described to correlate with tumour cell sensitivity to cytolytic cells. We reasoned that treatment with differentiation inducers could modulate melanoma cell sensitivity to NK and LAK cells. The present study demonstrates that human melanoma GLL-19 cells, when treated with the phorbol diester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in vitro, undergo growth inhibition and neuron-like differentiation. Moreover, PMA treatment induces an evident inhibition of GLL-19 cell sensitivity to NK- and LAK-mediated cytotoxicity. GLL-19 cells express constitutively MHC class I antigens. PMA treatment, however, does not modify the expression of MHC class I and class II DR antigens in human melanoma GLL-19 cells. We have finally evaluated the effects of PMA on the expression at the cell surface of adhesion factors such as ICAM-1, and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin; we have also studied the expression of the integrin vitronectin receptor, a membrane receptor for adhesive proteins. While adhesion factors and extracellular matrix proteins appear to play an important role in the interaction between immune effector and tumour target, it can be supposed that the modulation of such membrane-associated proteins or glycoproteins induces NK and LAK resistance in cancer cells. We indeed found that PMA treatment induced in GLL-19 a marked reduction of membrane expression of collagen IV and ICAM-1; moreover PMA reduced the cell membrane expression of the integrin vitronectin receptor. On the other hand, membrane expression of fibronectin and laminin was not affected by PMA. These data indicate that the acquisition of a NK- and LAK-resistant phenotype by GLL-19 cells occurs together with cell differentiation, down-regulation of membrane expression of collagen IV, ICAM-1 and vitronectin receptor, but in the absence of changes in MHC antigens.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although overexpression of the low-affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is frequently associated with advanced stages of human melanoma progression, the functional significance of this finding is unknown. We examined whether the degree of cell surface expression of p75NTR in human melanoma cell variants determines their extent of invasion stimulated by nerve growth factor (NGF). Treatment of MeWo melanoma cells or a metastatic spontaneous wheat germ agglutinin-resistant variant subline (70W) of MeWo cells with 2.5S NGF resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of invasion through a reconstituted basement membrane. This effect was most pronounced with the 70W subline that exhibits brain-metastasizing potential in nude mice but was not found with a poorly metastatic MeWo variant subline (3S5). The expression of p75NTR as determined by Northern blotting and immunoprecipitation analysis of 125I-labeled cell surface proteins correlated with NGF-stimulated invasion. The MeWo melanoma sublines used in this study did not express p140proto-trkA mRNA or any p140proto-trkA variant transcripts including p70trkA as determined by Northern analysis and RT-PCR analysis. Thus, these melanoma cells would not be expected to form functional p75-p140 heterodimers or p140-p140 homodimers capable of transducing an NGF-generated signal to p140proto-trkA cytoplasmic substrates. These cells did express authentic p145trkC transcripts. However, NGF did not catalytically activate p145trkC receptors via increased tyrosine phosphorylation as would be expected if p145trkC participated in the signaling established by NGF. Furthermore, a NGF-stimulated purine-analogue-sensitive kinase activity was found to coimmunoprecipitate with p75NTR. This p75NTR-associated kinase may coordinate initial signaling events evoked by p75NTR ligand interaction. Addition of 2.5S NGF, at concentrations that should saturate cell surface p75NTR, to matrix-adherent cultures of human MeWo and 70W but not 3S5 melanoma cells suppressed the expression of 92-kDa type IV collagenase and stimulated the production of 72-kDa type IV collagenase in its fully active 68-kDa form. In the absence of p140proto-trkA, the matrix-dependent effects of NGF on metalloproteinase expression of brain-metastatic 70W melanoma cells suggest a signaling role for the low-affinity melanoma p75NTR receptor and its associated purine-analogue-sensitive kinase in signaling enhanced matrix penetration of NGF-rich stromal microenvironments such as the brain.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Experience has shown that markers created in research laboratories can be adapted to everyday surgical pathology practice for malignant melanomas. These studies are feasible and readily conducted on frozen tissue as is routinely done in typing of lymphoma. The demonstration of heterogeneity using this monoclonal antibody panel, and other antibodies yet to come, may be important for prognostication. Tumor cell heterogeneity of surface antigens reflects disruption of the tumor cell's patterned gene expression. This should be regarded as an indication of different clones of cells (subsets) with a tumor, whether primary or secondary. It is entirely possible that autologous immune cells can kill or at least restrict the growth of subsets of melanoma cells having certain surface antigenic phenotypes while they are incompetent to handle other subsets. This would enable a particular phenotype within a primary melanoma to survive and escape the immunologic regression known to occur in 3 to 6 percent of these tumors. Such patients may present years later with metastases in the brain, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or lymph nodes. There are also implications in chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy for melanoma in this regard. It could be theorized that these agents may dispose of or restrict the growth of some phenotypes, leaving others in a resistant state. Perhaps the MDR gene is activated. Alternatively a tumor suppressor gene(s) could be absent or inactivated, as in neuroblastoma and carcinoma of the breast and lung. Markers present at the cell membrane surfaces and in the membranes themselves constitute an important field for study in the understanding of tumorigenesis. Many of these markers are present in embryos as early as the 4-to-8-cell stage and in blastocysts. Embryonic antigens in the intercell mass of blastocysts are stage-specific embryonic antigens. They are signals for organ development and the differentiation of cells. At various stages of this development, these markers disappear, especially upon differentiation into tissue types and specific organs. These cell signals are therefore organogenesis markers. Detecting a given antigen is not simple because it may be present but not immunohistochemically detectable because glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or sulfation have not taken place, or have resulted in a structural conformation not recognized by monoclonal antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Proteases play an important role in tumor cell invasion as these enzymes are able to degrade most components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and thus enable cells to penetrate interstitial connective tissues and basement membranes. We developed an improved culture model that allows the detailed study of melanoma cell invasion in vitro. In this model, high (BLM) or low (530) invasive melanoma cells were seeded on the dermal side of dead deepidermized dermis (DDD) and cultured for 14 days at the air/liquid interface. The high invasive cells invaded the tissue, leading to dermal tumor formation, whereas the low invasive cells did not. Analysis of the enzymatic activity of gelatinases by in situ gelatin zymography at neutral pH revealed proteolysis only in those composites cultured with high invasive melanoma cells. Interestingly, in situ zymograms performed at more acidic conditions, favoring the activity of cysteine proteases, exhibited markedly enhanced and widespread gelatinolysis compared to neutral pH. Cysteine protease inhibitors (E-64 and leupeptin) significantly reduced invasion of melanoma cells into these composites. These results indicate an important role of cysteine proteases for tumor invasion.",

CCN3 affects two fundamental features of melanocyte physiology: it inhibits melanocyte proliferation and stimulates their adhesion to the basement membrane. Here we report that expression of CCN3 is downregulated in advanced melanomas. Aggressive melanoma cell lines did not respond to treatment with CCN3 inducers, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), while less aggressive melanoma cell lines responded similarly to melanocytes. Immunostaining analyses revealed that CCN3 was present in melanoma cells close to the epidermal-dermal interface, but not in melanoma cells that had invaded deep into the dermis or had metastasized to lymph nodes. Contrary to our expectations, overexpression of CCN3 in 1205Lu metastatic melanoma cells did not affect their adhesion to collagen IV. However, CCN3 decreased the transcription and activation of matrix metalloproteinases and suppressed the invasion of 1205Lu melanoma cells. These results suggest that the lack of CCN3 in advanced melanoma cells contributes to their invasive phenotype. Whereas major matricellular proteins, such as osteopontin, tenascin or secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), are strongly upregulated in melanoma cells; CCN3 is the first member of this family that is downregulated.",

To identify suitable targets to develop novel approaches of treating canine melanoma, CSPG4 was studies to see whether it is expressed in canine malignant melanomas. Immunohistochemical staining of 65 canine malignant melanomas with an anti-human CSPG4-specific antibody detected CSPG4 in 37 cases (56.9%). Positive staining was more frequent, albeit not significantly, in amelanotic compared to melanotic tumours and was statistically associated with tumours having both melanin and the epithelioid histotype. The frequency of CSPG4 expression was similar to that of other melanoma antigens used as diagnostic markers for canine malignant melanoma, such as Melan A and the protein recognized by the PNL2 monoclonal antibody.

Monolayers of melanoma cells were grown on tissue culture-treated clusters and irradiated with up to 1.0 J/cmÂ². Surviving cells were stained with trypan blue and counted using a hemacytometer. The phosphate buffered saline absorbance was measured with a nanodrop spectrophotometer to detect melanin leakage from the melanoma cells post-laser irradiation. Photoacoustic signal magnitude was studied at both wavelengths using piezoelectric sensors. TRI with 6 ns resolution was used to image plasma membrane damage. Cell survival decreased proportionally with increasing laser fluence for both wavelengths, although the decrease is more pronounced for 355 nm radiation than for 532 nm. It was found that melanin leaks from cells equally for both wavelengths. No significant difference in photoacoustic signal was found between wavelengths.

MIB-1/Ki-67 was analyzed as an example for a common proliferation marker. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV/CD26 was analyzed as a marker affecting both proliferation and invasion of malignant melanocytic tumors. Semiquantitative assessment of both immunolocalization and immunoreactivity of retinoblastoma protein and phospho-retinoblastoma protein Ser795, MIB-1/Ki-67, matrix metalloproteinase-1, matrix metalloproteinase-2, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 and integrin beta3 revealed no consistent differences between deep penetrating nevi (n=14) and matched cases of nodular malignant melanomas (n=10). Matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 immunostaining of some deep penetrating nevi even exceeded that of nodular malignant melanomas. Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression scores of nodular malignant melanomas were higher than those of deep penetrating nevi, which was, however, not significantly discriminative. In contrast, immunostaining of dipeptidyl peptidase IV was significantly discriminative due to a consistent lack of dipeptidyl peptidase IV-expression in nodular malignant melanomas. These results add evidence that among the selected markers supposed to be relevant for melanoma progression the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase IV can be used to support diagnosis of deep penetrating nevi in doubtful cases. As loss of dipeptidyl peptidase IV may also be causally linked to the transition of invasive to metastatic phenotypes, the molecular mechanisms downstream of dipeptidyl peptidase IV deserve to be studied in more detail in future investigations.",

Vaccination with this DC-mv-based dual vaccine induced specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)-dependent tumor rejection and suppressed the growth of both types of tumor xenografts in mice. In addition, induction of CTL by this vaccine resulted in cross-protection responses and consequently enabled significant enhanced anti-tumor effects, indicating the synergistic anti-tumor activity.

P18 peptide initially binds to the melanoma cell membrane via electrostatic interaction, causing the cell membrane to rupture.

This was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lowering of total cellular ATP levels, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and reduced cell viability. The latter was rescued by the antioxidant vitamin E and high extracellular glucose levels (25Â mM), indicating the involvement of ROS-induced cell death and a dependence on glycolysis for cell survival upon BAY 87-2243 treatment. BAY 87-2243 significantly reduced tumor growth in various BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenografts and patient-derived melanoma mouse models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that inhibition of mutated BRAF using the specific small molecule inhibitor vemurafenib increased the OXPHOS dependency of BRAF mutant melanoma cells.

The relative proportion of positive cells and intensity of staining was higher in neoplastic cells, compared to normal cutaneous cells. Of the 76 cases of common melanocytic naevi (CMN) studies, 46 were weakly reactive with MAb 263. Heterogeneity of immunoreactivity was found in primary melanoma lesions with a variable range of positive cells. Of 37 cases studied, 34 were moderately to strongly positive. Immunoreactivity showed subcellular localization of the GH-receptor in cell membranes, was predominantly cytoplasmic, but strong nuclear immunoreaction was also apparent in many instances. The nuclear localization of immunoreactivity is the result of nuclear GH-receptor/binding protein, identically to the cytosolic and plasma growth hormone binding protein. Intense immuno-reactivity was also observed in the cellular Golgi area of established cell lines and cultured tissue-derived cells in exponential growth phase, indicating cells are capable of GH-receptor synthesis. In the primary lesions, dermal tumour cells tended to be more immunoreactive relative to those seen in the dermal region. Metastatic lesions in various organs also expressed growth hormone receptors in secondary tumour cells and all of the metastatic cases were positive.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is a disease characterized by clinical evidence of host defense, possibly immunologically mediated. It is a disease which tends to be refractory to both radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy has been used in three phases of the disease. 1. Intralesional immunotherapy with a nonspecific immune adjuvant in patients with local intradermal or soft tissue recurrence. This treatment produces approximately 15% regression of both injected and uninjected lesions, and about 60% regression of injected lesions only. Both clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this regression is immunologically mediated. 2. Patients with surgical removal of all clinically demonstrable tumor, either primary disease alone or regional node recurrence, active nonspecific, and specific, immunotherapy has been used in an adjuvant setting. There is considerable controversy about the benefits accruing to such immunotherapy, but most large scale prospective and randomized studies have suggested that if benefit does result it is modest in degree and probably cannot be measured in terms of increase in cure rate. 3. Immunotherapy has also been used as a nonspecific active adjuvant to single drug or polychemotherapy in patients with disseminated melanoma. Whereas complete response rate may be slightly increased by this maneuver there is no convincing evidence that immunotherapy markedly increases the total objective response rate to polychemotherapy, and survival is only marginally superior when immunotherapy is added to chemotherapy in this setting. Further studies need to be done with active specific immunotherapy with tumor cell membrane extracts; as an adjuvant in patients with minimal body burden of tumor cells; and to study the inaction between chemotherapy and immunotherapy in this disease. Furthermore, studies of chemically defined fractions of either bacterial cell wall or tumor cell extracts must be evaluated both in terms of their ability to augment cell mediated immune responses in the melanoma patient, and also in terms of their ability to induce objective benefit for the patient. The possible use of immunotherapy in patients with primary melanoma has been briefly explored but needs further study. Possible additive effects with radiotherapy and immunotherapy should also be looked at in this disease utilizing high dose fractions and other new forms of radiotherapeutic technique.",

Prevention of metastasis is an important aspect of successful treatment; however, it is known that metastasis can be induced by different treatment modalities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of electrochemotherapy with cisplatin on the metastatic potential of human malignant melanoma cells. Cells treated by electrochemotherapy with cisplatin were tested for their ability to migrate and invade through Matrigel-coated porous membrane. In addition, RNA was isolated from cells after treatment and differentially expressed genes were investigated by microarray analysis to evaluate the effect of electrochemotherapy with cisplatin on gene expression. There were no significant changes observed in cell migration and invasion of melanoma cells after electrochemotherapy. In addition, there were no changes observed in cell adhesion on Matrigel. Gene expression analysis showed that a very low number of genes were differentially expressed after electrochemotherapy with cisplatin. Two genes, LAMB3 and CD63 involved in cell migration, were both downregulated after electrochemotherapy with cisplatin and the expression of metastasis promoting genes was not increased after electrochemotherapy.

Inconsistent effects from growth stimulation to induction of apoptosis of malignant tumor cells, however, have been reported. Melanoma is an increasingly common and potentially lethal malignancy. It was reported that melanoma cells were more susceptible to ascorbate toxicity than any other tumor cells. The mechanisms accounting for ascorbate-induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells, however, have remained unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of sodium ascorbate on cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human malignant melanoma A375.S2 cells. A375.S2 cells were incubated with a certain range of concentrations of sodium ascorbate for various time periods. In order to examine the effects of sodium ascorbate on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis, we performed 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride assays and flow cytometry analysis. Polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the mRNA levels of p53, p21, p27, cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4, which are associated with cell cycle S-phase arrest and apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed that sodium ascorbate significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the A375.S2 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. The increased expressions of p53 and p21, and the decreased expressions of cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4, indicated the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase after the cells had been treated with sodium ascorbate. Induction of apoptosis involved an increase in the levels of p53, p21 and cellular Ca, and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase 3 before culminating in apoptosis in sodium ascorbate-treated A375.S2 cells.",

We found that melanoma cells expressed the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 in the cytoplasm. Cell membrane extension and migration of melanoma cells were inhibited by SIRT1 inhibitors or SIRT1 knockdown, whereas SIRT1 activators enhanced elongation of protrusion and cellular motility. In B16F1 cells, growth factor stimulation induced lamellipodium extension, a characteristic feature at the leading edge of migrating cells, and SIRT1 was found in the lamellipodium. SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) or SIRT1 small interfering RNAs suppressed the lamellipodium extension by serum or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The lamellipodium formation by dominant-active Rac1 was also inhibited by NAM, a SIRT1 inhibitor. NAM inhibited the accumulation of phosphorylated Akt at the submembrane by serum or PDGF. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we found that NAM impaired PDGF-dependent increase in the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate level at the leading edge. NAM inhibited the abdominal metastasis of transplanted B16F1 melanoma cells in C57BL6/J mice and improved survival. Finally, SIRT1-knockdown B16F1 cells showed significantly reduced metastasis in transplanted mice compared with that in control B16F1 cells.

In the present study, we applied the technique to comparative studies on common glycoproteins present in the matched patient primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines. Metastatic melanoma cells (WM266-4) contained a large amount of polyLacNAc-type N-glycans in comparison with primary melanoma cells (WM115). To identify the glycoproteins expressing these N-glycans, glycopeptides having polyLacNAc-type N-glycans were captured by a Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA)-immobilized agarose column. The captured glycopeptides were analyzed by LC/MS after removing N-glycans, and some glycoproteins such as basigin, lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1), and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) were identified in both WM115 and WM266-4 cells.

In addition, sulfation patterns of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains in CSPG4 showed dramatic changes between these cell lines.

Here, we offer the first evidence that an antioxidant enzyme has a key role in this transition. We found that the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) inversely correlated with the metastatic capacity of human melanoma cells. Silencing Prx2 expression stimulated proliferation and migration, whereas ectopic expression of Prx2 produced the opposite effect. Mechanistic investigations indicated that Prx2 negatively regulated Src/ERK activation status, which in turn fortified adherens junctions function by increasing E-cadherin expression and phospho-Y654-dependent retention of Î²-catenin in the plasma membrane. In murine melanoma cells, Prx2 silencing enhanced lung metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, the natural compound gliotoxin, which is known to exert a Prx-like activity, inhibited proliferation and migration as well as lung metastasis of Prx2-deficient melanoma cells. Overall, our findings reveal that Prx2 is a key regulator of invasion and metastasis in melanoma, and also suggest a pharmacologic strategy to effectively decrease deadly malignant forms of this disease.",

The CD9 cDNA-transfected cells with elevated CD9 expression displayed increased MMP-2 and decreased MMP-9 expression when compared with the mock transfectant cells.

Phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK and c-Jun in MelJuso cells were also significantly increased by CD9 transfection. In addition, the down-regulation of p38 MAPK and JNK by siRNA transfection resulted in a decrease in MMP-2 expression by MelJuso cells. Promoter analysis and gel shift assay showed that the CD9-induced MMP-2 expression is mediated by a functional AP-1 site through interactions with AP-1 transcription factors including c-Jun.

The cytotoxicity on B16 melanoma cells was evaluated on an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system with a novel modified chip. In vivo anti-melanoma effect of the ethosome gel was explored. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometric investigations were done. The MTO ethosomes had the size of 78nm and the zeta potential of -55mV. The ethosomes were flexible vesicles and showed much higher in vitro permeability across the rat skin than MTO aqueous solutions. The ethosomes had significant cytotoxicity and higher in vivo anti-melanoma effect than MTO solutions. The calreticulin membrane translocation of B16 cells was improved by the MTO ethosomes and the cell uptake of MTO was confirmed.

Without beta(2)m, the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules cannot assemble, thereby abolishing their transport to the cell membrane and the subsequent recognition by antigen-specific T cells. Here we report a case of defective antigen presentation caused by the expression of a beta(2)m with a Cys-to-Trp substitution at position 25 (beta(2)m(C25W)). This substitution causes misfolding and degradation of beta(2)m(C25W) but does not result in complete lack of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule expression on the surface of melanoma VMM5B cells. Despite HLA class I expression, VMM5B cells are not recognized by HLA class I-restricted, melanoma antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes even following loading with exogenous peptides or transduction with melanoma antigen-expressing viruses. Lysis of VMM5B cells is restored only following reconstitution with exogenous or endogenous wild-type beta(2)m protein. Together, our results indicate impairment of antigenic peptide presentation because of a dysfunctional beta(2)m and provide a mechanism for the lack of close association between HLA class I expression and susceptibility of tumor cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes-mediated lysis in malignant diseases.",

In mouse melanoma cells, Met expression is increased by alphaMSH via the activation of the cAMP pathway. However, the mechanism by which cAMP regulates MET and the biological consequences of this increase were not known. In the present report, we show that alphaMSH regulates MET expression in both human melanocytes and mouse melanoma cells through a transcriptional mechanism that requires MITF. Furthermore, the adenovirus driven expression of MITF is sufficient to increase MET in melanoma cells. Functional analysis of the MET promoter allows us to identify an E-box motif conserved in both human and mouse promoter that mediates the effect of MITF. Interestingly, up-regulation of MET expression by cAMP leads to an exacerbated HGF signaling and allows HGF to protect melanocytes and melanoma cells from apoptosis. Thus, physiological stimuli or pathological events that would induce MITF expression may lead to increased MET expression thereby favoring melanoma survival. These observations strengthen the roles of MITF and MET in melanoma development.",

A subset of 5 clones with the highest susceptibility to lysis had increased ICAM-1 antigen expression. Phenotype analysis for the presence of extracellular matrix receptors in the beta 1- and beta 3-integrin families revealed that the tumor clones with the highest susceptibility to lysis were also characterized by frequent expression or increased expression of multiple receptors in the beta 1 family including VLA-1, -2, -3, -4 and -6. The correlation between phenotypic markers and susceptibility to lysis, seen at the clonal level, was confirmed by selection experiments on the uncloned metastasis Me665/2. In fact, the neoplastic population surviving 3 cycles of immunoselection with IL-2-activated lymphocytes exhibited, in comparison to the unselected metastasis: (1) reduced susceptibility to lysis and (2) reduced expression of ICAM-1 and of VLA antigens. In contrast, enhanced susceptibility to lysis and up-regulation of ICAM-1, VLA-1 and VLA-3 antigens were observed on melanoma cells recovered after invading a reconstituted basement membrane. These data indicate that melanoma cells with enhanced susceptibility to cell-mediated lysis can be identified on the basis of phenotypic characteristics (ICAM-1 and VLA antigen profile) and functional features (invasive ability on reconstituted basement membranes).",

Both the extractable activator content [8.66 +/- 7.8 \"Committee on Thrombolytic Agents\" (CTA) U/g tissue] and the activator secretion rates (0.90 +/- 1.6 CTA U/g/hr) were low in comparison with values for other human tumors.

On the average, 77% of the activator activity was of the urokinase type in the extracts, and 90% in the culture fluids. Immunoperoxidase reaction for the detection of urokinase showed this enzyme to be localized mainly in the cell membrane of the melanoma cells; stromal elements showed no specific staining. These results are of interest in view of the findings made recently by investigators in several laboratories that in all but one of the melanoma cell cultures derived from metastatic human tumors, only the vascular type (\"tissue activator\") was cell associated or was secreted into the culture medium.

This study proposes a wide panel of 22 markers having important functions in different biological functions (cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair proteins and membranous receptors) to provide a combination of proteins associated with either benign or malignant phenotype. Using tissue microarrays, we compared protein expression profiles in 28 typical Spitz nevi and 62 primary vertical growth phase non-spitzoid melanomas. Most of the significant differences were linked to cell-cycle deregulation such as overexpression of cyclin D1 and p21 in Spitz nevi compared with non-spitzoid melanomas (74 vs 16% and 91 vs 27%, respectively) and mitotic rate including Ki-67, highly expressed in deep areas of non-spitzoid melanomas (37%), whereas it is not expressed in Spitz nevi (0%), topoisomerase IIalpha (79% in non-spitzoid melanomas vs 15% in Spitz nevi) and nuclear survivin (69% in melanomas vs 0% in Spitz nevi). A combination of biological markers differentially expressed in Spitz nevi from non-spitzoid melanomas is defined, thus providing a potential tool for histopathological differential diagnostic between Spitz nevus and melanoma. Nevertheless, more studies including atypical Spitz nevi and spitzoid melanomas are necessary to further establish a reliable panel to differentiate among difficult cases.",

In addition to collagenases-1 and -3 that have been implicated in invasive growth behaviour of various malignant tumours, we analysed the levels of 72-kDa gelatinase and its activators MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 in cultured melanoma cells. The lesions examined included three cases of lentigo maligna and 28 cases of Clark grade I-V melanomas. The premalignant as well as the grade I tumours were consistently negative for collagenase-1 and -3 and TIMP-1 and -3. The collagenases were predominantly expressed in the cancer cells of Clark grade III and IV tumours. TIMP-1 and -3 were abundantly expressed in the cancer and/or stromal cells of grade III and IV melanomas, while TIMP-2 protein was detected also in melanomas representing lower invasive potential. Northern analysis of seven melanoma cell lines showed that the expression of collagenase-1 and TIMPs-1 and -3 was associated with 72-kDa gelatinase positivity. All melanoma cell lines were positive for MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 mRNAs. Our results suggest that overexpression of collagenases-1 and -3 and TIMPs-1 and -3 is induced during melanoma progression.

A decrease in macrophage Ia expression is associated with a decrease in immune function in vitro. However, the effect of diseases accompanied by immunosuppression, such as cancer, on macrophage Ia expression has not been studied. The expression of Ia antigen was induced by the culture of murine peritoneal macrophages with recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN). Maximal expression was achieved after 4 days of culture. Membrane vesicles shed from the murine B16 F10 melanoma cell line inhibited the in vitro induction of Ia expression by 40 to 90% in allogeneic and syngeneic systems. Inhibition was not due to toxicity, a reduction in IFN activity, phagocytosis or contamination of the vesicle preparation with endotoxin, which is an inhibitor of Ia expression. Inhibition exerted by vesicles was prostaglandin-dependent and was over-come by increasing concentrations of IFN. It is possible that the reduction of macrophage Ia antigen expression by tumor cell products, such as shed membrane vesicles, contributes to the immunosuppression of tumor-bearing hosts.

In addition, the treatment of melanoma cells with CH11 or TNF-alpha induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the phosphorylation of Fas-associated domain (FADD), the cleavage of caspase-8, and truncation of Bid. Using RNA interference and pharmacological inhibitors, we could confirm the pro-apoptotic activity of IDO and address the mechanisms, which are responsible for its transcriptional regulation and the modulation of its pro-apoptotic activity during death receptor activation in melanoma cells.

The results showed that at relatively high concentrations (100 microg/mL), PEP005 killed melanoma cells mainly by induction of necrosis. In 20% of cell lines, evidence of apoptosis was observed. Apoptosis was caspase-dependent and associated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential that were not inhibitable by overexpression of Bcl-2 or inhibition of caspases but were blocked by inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). Low concentrations (1 or 10 microg/mL) of PEP005 either increased or decreased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a cell line-dependent manner. These changes in TRAIL-induced apoptosis seemed to be due to activation of PKC and varying levels of PKC isoenzymes in different melanoma cell lines.

We demonstrate that melanoma cell lines release, in vitro and in vivo (when transplanted in nude mice), soluble gp130 (sgp130), a potential antagonist of cytokines from the IL-6 family.

PCR and Northern blot analysis only identified one gp130 membrane mRNA, suggesting that the soluble form of gp130 is generated by proteolytic cleavage. OSM reproducibly increases sgp130 released by melanoma cell lines, whereas leukemia inhibitory factor stimulates the production of sgp130 in only one of three cell lines tested. This tumor-derived sgp130 is functional because it binds in solution to the IL-6-soluble IL-6 receptor (gp80) complex. Recombinant sgp130 inhibits the growth inhibitory activity of the IL-6-soluble IL-6 receptor complex and OSM on some melanoma cell lines.

        "Doc_abstract":"The rapid increase in the incidence of malignant melanomas has not been associated with improved therapeutic options over the years. Indeed melanomas have proven resistant to apoptosis (type I programmed cell death (PCD)) and consequently to most chemotherapy and immunotherapy. It is believed that this resistance can be partly overcome by proautophagic drugs inducing type II (autophagy) PCD. Change at the genomic, transcriptional, and post-translational level of G-proteins and protein kinases, including Ras, plays an important role in the ability of melanomas to resist apoptosis. Ras transformation itself requires membrane anchorage and the overexpression of galectin-1 increases membrane-associated Ras. In this study, it has been found that decreasing galectin-1 expression in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells in vitro by means of an anti-galectin-1 small interfering RNA approach does not modify their sensitivity to type I and type II PCD. However, it does induce heat shock protein 70-mediated lysosomal membrane permeabilization, a process associated with cathepsin B release into the cytosol, which in turn is believed to sensitize the cells to the proautophagic effects of temozolomide when grafted in vivo. Furthermore, temozolomide when compared to the proapoptotic drug cisplatin, significantly increased the survival times of mice in the B16F10 melanoma model.",

However, some cancer cell types, including malignant melanoma cells, are resistant             to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, drugs that can amplify TRAIL cytotoxicity             are urgently required. Depolarization of the plasma membrane potential is associated             with apoptosis induced by a variety of death-inducing agents but its role in apoptosis             remains a matter of debate. We found that TRAIL treatment resulted in robust depolarization             in human melanoma cells with a considerable lagÂ (2-4Â h). Moreover, membrane-depolarizing             agents, including K+ and ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel inhibitors glibenclamide             and U37883A enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. On the contrary, inhibitors of calcium-             and voltage-dependent K+ channels and mitochondrial KATP channels had no such             effects. Melanocytes were insensitive to TRAIL-induced depolarization and apoptosis             as well as to the sensitization by membrane-depolarizing agents despite their             substantial surface expression of death receptors. TRAIL induced robust activation             of X-box-binding protein-1 and caspase-12, both of which were enhanced by the             K+ and KATP channel inhibitors, but not by other K+ channel inhibitors. Finally,             caspase-12-selective inhibitor completely abolished the amplification of apoptosis.             These findings suggest that depolarization promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated             death pathway, thereby amplifying TRAIL cytotoxicity. Thus, membrane-depolarizing             agents such as KATP channel inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in the treatment             of TRAIL-resistant cancer cells without impairing tumor-selectivity.",

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments assessed the association of Pgp with the adhesion molecule CD44 in multidrug resistant (MDR) melanoma cells, compared with parental ones. In MDR cells, the two proteins colocalized in the plasma membrane as visualized by confocal microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin cryosections. MDR melanoma cells displayed a more invasive phenotype compared with parental cells, as demonstrated by quantitative transwell chamber invasion assay. This was accomplished by a different migration strategy adopted by resistant cells (\"chain collective\") previously described in tumor cells with high metastatic capacity. The Pgp molecule, after stimulation with specific antibodies, appeared to cooperate with CD44, through the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins. This activation led to an increase of metalloproteinase (MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9) mRNAs, and proteolytic activities, which are associated with an increased invasive behavior.

        "Doc_abstract":"A major prerequisite for the success of tumor vaccines is their effective uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and transport of these APCs to the draining lymph nodes, where the processed and presented tumor-associated antigens activate tumor-specific naive T cells. We previously suggested that the immunogenicity of autologus tumor vaccines in humans may be augmented by engineering vaccinating tumor cell membranes to express alpha-galactosyl (alpha-gal) epitopes (i.e., Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc-R). Subsequent in situ binding of natural anti-Gal IgG molecules to these epitopes would result in the formation of immune complexes that target tumor vaccines for uptake by APCs, via the interaction of the Fc portion of anti-Gal with Fcgamma receptors on APCs. This hypothesis was tested in a unique experimental animal model of knockout mice for alpha1,3galactosyltransferase (alpha1,3GT) and the mouse melanoma B16-BL6 (referred to here as BL6). Like humans, these mice lack alpha-gal epitopes and produce anti-GaL BL6 melanoma cels are highly tumorigenic, and like human tumor cells, they lack alpha-gal epitopes. Expression of alpha-gal epitopes on these melanoma cells was achieved by stable transfection with alpha,3GT cDNA. The transfected melanoma cells (termed BL6alphaGT) express approximately 2 x 10(6) alpha-gal epitopes per cell and readily form immune complexes with anti-Gal. Vaccination of the mice with 2 x 10(6) irradiated melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes, followed by challenge with 0.5 x 10(6) live parental melanoma cells, resulted in protection for at least 2 months (i.e, no tumor growth) in one-third of the mice, whereas all mice immunized with irradiated parental melanoma cells developed tumors 21-26 days post-challenge. The proportion of protected mice doubled when the mice were immunized twice with irradiated melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes and challenged with 0.2 x 10(6) live BL6 cells. Histological studies on the developing tumors in challenged mice that were immunized with melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes demonstrated extensive infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages, whereas no mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in tumors of mice immunized with parental tumor cells. Overall, these studies imply that immunization of alpha1,3GT knockout mice with BL6 melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes elicits, in a proportion of the population, protective immune response against the same tumor lacking such epitopes. These studies further suggest that similar immunization of cancer patients with autologous tumor vaccines that are engineered to express alpha-gal epitopes may increase the immune response to autologous tumor-associated antigens and, thus, may elicit immune-mediated destruction of metastatic cells expressing these antigens.",

Paraffin sections of untreated uveal melanomas (n=18, 3/18 spindle; 11/18 mixed, and 4/18 epithelioid) were examined for MMP-1 (collagenase 1), MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinases A and B), MT1-MMP (membrane-type 1-MMP), MMP-19, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 (tissue inhibitors of MMPs), using indirect peroxidase immunohistochemistry. The distribution and intensity of immunolabelling was graded semi-quantitatively (0-3) by 2 independent observers. Non-parametric analyses were used to test for associations between tumour cell type, and the average grade of MMP or TIMP expression. Immunostaining for MMP-1, -9, -19 and MT1-MMP was > or =Grade 2 in more than 70% of specimens, and a heterogeneous pattern of MMP-1, -9, MT1-MMP and TIMP-3 expression was observed. At the tumour-scleral interface (TSI), melanoma cells had a flattened morphology and a much reduced MMP and TIMP expression, with a high expression in tumour areas adjacent to the TSI. Tumour vasculature and stromal cells strongly expressed MMP-2. We also observed heterogeneous immunostaining of the vasculature by MMP-1, -9, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 antibodies, and of the extravascular matrix by MMP-9 antibody. The distinct immunostaining patterns observed for MMPs and TIMPs within uveal melanoma are consistent with their involvement in tumour growth and angiogenesis. In particular, the heterogeneous expression within regions of the tumours, and the localized expression in vasculature and stromal cells emphasises the importance of the tumour microenvironment in the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma (and other tumours).",

Similar melanoma growth inhibition was obtained for mice treated with encapsulated or non-encapsulated endostatin-expressing cells. The treatment of mice bearing melanoma tumor with encapsulated endostatin-expressing cells was decreased by 50.0%, whereas a decrease of 56.7% in tumor thickness was obtained for mice treated with non-encapsulated cells. Treatment of Ehrlich tumor-bearing mice with non-encapsulated endostatin-expressing cells reduced tumor thickness by 52.4%, whereas lower tumor growth inhibition was obtained for mice treated with encapsulated endostatin-expressing cells: 24.2%. Encapsulated endostatin-secreting fibroblasts failed to survive until the end of the treatment. However, endostatin release from the devices to the surrounding tissues was confirmed by immunostaining. Decrease in vascular structures, functional vessels and extension of the vascular area were observed in melanoma microenvironments.;This study indicates that immunoisolation devices containing endostatin-expressing cells are effective for the inhibition of the growth of melanoma and Ehrlich tumors.Macroencapsulation of engineered cells is therefore a reliable platform for the refinement of innovative therapeutic strategies against tumors.",

The first population is defined as the 'responder' cells and the second as the 'stimulator' cells. We found that the presence of 10(5) B16F1 stimulator cells during the growth of responder B16F1 cells from approximately 10(4) to approximately 10(6) cells resulted in cells with an increased metastatic phenotype (greater than 8-fold increase in median number of lung tumors relative to untreated B16F1 parental cells). The presence of stimulator cells also increased the metastatic phenotype of nascent clones, which were grown to a population size of less than 10(6) cells, suggesting that the rate of generation of metastatic variants of the responder B16F1 clones was affected by the stimulator cells. Other cell lines, including highly metastatic B16F10 and BL6 melanoma cells, and KHT35-L1 fibrosarcoma cells, were effective stimulator cells when as few as 10(4) cells were added to transwells. In addition, normal immortalized NIH 3T3 cells were effective stimulator cells only at 10(5) cells/transwell.

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer. Unfortunately, there is currently no chemotherapeutic agent available to significantly prolong the survival of the most patients with metastatic melanomas. Here we report that the Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761), one of the most widely sold herbal supplements in the world, potently induces apoptosis in human melanoma cells by disturbing the balance between pro- and anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins. Treatment with EGb761 induced varying degrees of apoptosis in melanoma cell lines but not in melanocytes. Induction of apoptosis was caspase-dependent and appeared to be mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, in that it was associated with reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of Bax and Bak. Although EGb761 did not cause significant change in the expression levels of the BH3-only Bcl-2 family proteins Bim, Puma, Noxa, and Bad, it significantly downregulated Mcl-1 in sensitive but not resistant melanoma cells, suggesting a major role of Mcl-1 in regulating apoptosis of melanoma cells induced by EGb761. Indeed, siRNA knockdown of Mcl-1 enhanced EGb761-induced apoptosis, which was associated with increased activation of Bax and Bak. Taken together, these results demonstrate that EGb761 kills melanoma cells through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and that Mcl-1 is a major regulator of sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by EGb761. Therefore, EGb761 with or without in combination with targeting Mcl-1 may be a useful strategy in the treatment of melanoma. ",

In order to understand the basis for this difference, the levels of the sialyltransferase that converts GM3 to GD3 (CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid:GM3 sialyltransferase or GD3 synthase, EC 2.4.99.8) were analyzed in melanoma and other cell lines. Enzyme levels were determined in vitro using membrane preparations and measuring the addition of [14C]-N-acetylneuraminic acid from CMP-[14C]-N-acetylneuraminic acid to GM3 in the presence of Triton CF-54. Sialyltransferase levels in 44 human cancer cell lines (including melanoma, neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, various carcinomas, and leukemias) and cultures of normal melanocytes and kidney epithelial cells were compared, and the products were identified by thin layer chromatography and fluorography. Melanoma cell lines exhibited the highest levels of incorporation and GD3 was found to be the major product. GM3 was also formed, apparently from endogenous lactosylceramide. Very low levels of GD3 synthase were found in normal melanocytes. Neuroblastoma and some astrocytoma cell lines also had significant levels of GD3 synthase. Some other cell lines incorporated high levels of radioactivity but the products did not correspond to GD3 and the major product was usually GM3. In general the levels of GD3 synthase correlated with the expression of GD3 in the various cell types. These results point to higher levels of GD3 synthase being directly responsible for the enhanced expression of GD3 in melanoma.",

The absence of any sign of intravasation and the pericytic location of tumor cells in this typical image raised the question of the role of these complexes in promoting tumorigenesis. Using the mouse B16 melanoma model, we observed an increase of angio-tumoral complexes with tumor progression, again without any evidence of intravasation.

The level of beta-catenin is regulated through GSK-3beta phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues, all of which are encoded for in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1). Mutations altering the GSK-3beta phosphorylation sites lead to cellular accumulation of beta-catenin and constitutive transcription of Tcf/Lef target genes. Such mutations have previously been found in melanoma cell lines. In our study, primary melanomas and their corresponding metastases were screened for CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis. One of 31 primary tumors and 1 of 37 metastases, both originating from the same patient, had a TCT to TTT mutation at codon 45, changing serine to phenylalanine. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed membranous localization of beta-catenin in a majority of the samples. The mutated primary tumor and metastasis, however, displayed widespread cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of beta-catenin. An additional 30% of the primary tumors showed focal cytoplasmic and nuclear staining.

MTf is expressed at very low levels in normal tissues and in high amounts in melanoma cells although its function remains elusive. To understand the function of MTf, we utilized whole-genome microarray analysis to examine the gene expression profile of five models after modulating MTf expression. These models included two new stably transfected MTf hyper-expression models (SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma and LMTK- fibroblasts) and one cell type (SK-Mel-28 melanoma) where MTf was down-regulated by post-transcriptional gene silencing. These findings were compared with alterations in gene expression identified using the MTf-/- mice. In addition, the changes identified from the microarray data were also assessed in a new model of MTf down-regulation in SK-Mel-2 melanoma cells. In the cell line models, MTf hyper-expression led to increased proliferation, whereas MTf down-regulation resulted in decreased proliferation. Across all five models of MTf down- and up-regulation, we identified three genes modulated by MTf. These included ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5, whose change in expression mirrored MTf down- or up-regulation. In addition, thiamine triphosphatase and transcription factor 4 were inversely expressed relative to MTf levels across all five models. The products of these three genes are involved in membrane transport, thiamine phosphorylation and proliferation/survival, respectively. This study identifies novel molecular targets directly or indirectly regulated by MTf and the potential pathways involved in its function, including modulation of proliferation.",

The identification and understanding of molecular mechanisms which ensure the integration of particular dendrimeric nanostructures in tumor cellular environment can provide valuable guidance in their coupling strategies with antitumor or diagnostic agents. Two structurally distinct maltose-shell modified 5th generation (G5) poly(propylene imine) (PPI) glycodendrimers fluorescently labeled, (a) with open maltose shell, cationic charged G5-PPI-OS and (b) with dense maltose shell and nearly neutral G5-PPI-DS, were tested in relation with several melanoma cell lines. We found that three melanoma cell lines internalize G5-PPI-DS structure more efficiently than non tumoral HEK297T cells. Furthermore, the internalization pathways of G5-PPI-OS and G5-PPI-DS are characteristic for each tumor cell phenotype and include more than one mechanism. As a general trend, large amounts of both G5-PPI-OS and G5-PPI-DS are internalized on cholesterol-dependent pathway in MJS primary melanoma cells and on non conventional pathways in SK28 metastatic melanoma cells. G5-PPI-OS, temporarily retained at plasma membrane in both cell lines, is internalized slower in metastatic than in primary phenotype. Unlike G5-PPI-OS, G5-PPI-DS is immediately endocytosed in both cell lines. The unconventional internalization pathway and trafficking, exclusively used by G5-PPI-DS in metastatic cells, is described at molecular level. The decay kinetics of fluorescent labeled G5-PPI-OS and G5-PPI-DS is distinct in the two cellular phenotypes.

It is expressed by various epithelial and non-epithelial cells, and notably by stem and cancer stem cells. In non-cancerous cells such as neuro-epithelial and hematopoietic stem cells, prominin-1 is selectively concentrated in plasma membrane protrusions, and released into the extracellular milieu in association with small vesicles. Previously, we demonstrated that prominin-1 contributes to melanoma cells pro-metastatic properties and suggested that it may constitute a molecular target to prevent prominin-1-expressing melanomas from colonizing and growing in lymph nodes and distant organs. Here, we report that three distinct pools of prominin-1 co-exist in cultures of human FEMX-I metastatic melanoma. Morphologically, in addition to the plasma membrane localization, prominin-1 is found within the intracellular compartments, (e.g., Golgi apparatus) and in association with extracellular membrane vesicles. The latter prominin-1-positive structures appeared in three sizes (small, â¤40 nm; intermediates ~40-80 nm, and large, >80 nm). Functionally, the down-regulation of prominin-1 in FEMX-I cells resulted in a significant reduction of number of lipid droplets as observed by coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering image analysis and Oil red O staining, and surprisingly in a decrease in the nuclear localization of beta-catenin, a surrogate marker of Wnt activation. Moreover, the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) promoter activity was 2 to 4 times higher in parental than in prominin-1-knockdown cells.

In this report, focusing our attention on ciglitazone, we show that ciglitazone inhibits melanoma growth by inducing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, whereas normal melanocytes are resistant to ciglitazone. In melanoma cells, ciglitazone-induced apoptosis is associated with caspase activations and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Induction of cell-cycle arrest by ciglitazone is associated with changes in expression of key cell-cycle regulators such as p21, cyclin D1, and pRB hypophosphorylation. Cell-cycle arrest occurs at low ciglitazone concentrations and through a PPARgamma-dependent pathway, whereas the induction of apoptosis is caused by higher ciglitazone concentrations and independently of PPARgamma. These results allow an effective molecular dissociation between proapoptotic effects and growth inhibition evoked by ciglitazone in melanoma cells. Finally, we show that in vivo treatment of nude mice by ciglitazone dramatically inhibits human melanoma xenograft development. The data presented suggest that ciglitazone might be a better candidate for clinical trials in melanoma treatment than the thiazolidinediones currently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, such as rosiglitazone, which is devoid of a proapoptotic PPARgamma-independent function.",

Shih et al., Cancer Res., 54: 2514-2520, 1994), we showed that Mel-CAM is a cell-cell adhesion molecule with a possible role in melanoma invasion and metastasis. Here, we define the molecular mechanism responsible for cell-cell adhesion of Mel-CAM and demonstrate its role in melanoma-endothelial cell interactions. Most of human melanoma cells, including Mel-CAM-negative SBcl-2 cells, adhered to nitrocellulose-immobilized Mel-CAM produced by baculovirus recombinants. This adhesion can be blocked by full-length Mel-CAM or polyclonal antiserum against Mel-CAM. Adhesion is not affected by the presence of EDTA, truncated Mel-CAM extracellular domain, or heparan sulfate proteoglycan. In cell aggregation assays, Mel-CAM-negative SBcl-2 cells cluster with U937TM cells (U937 transfected with Mel-CAM cDNA) but not with control nontransfectants, suggesting that SBcl-2 cells express the ligand for Mel-CAM. SBcl-2 cells also form heterotypic aggregates with Mel-CAM-positive human endothelial cells but not with Mel-CAM-negative but ligand-positive smooth muscle cells.

By EDI-OCT, choroidal features included optical shadowing in 36 (100%) and overlying choriocapillaris thinning in 37 (100%). Outer retinal features included shaggy photoreceptors in 18 (49%), as well as absence (structural loss) of photoreceptors in 9 (24%), inner segment-outer segment junction in 24 (65%), external limiting membrane in 16 (43%), outer nuclear layer in 6 (16%), and outer plexiform layer in 4 (11%). Inner retinal features included irregularity of inner nuclear layer in 3 (8%), inner plexiform layer in 3 (8%), ganglion cell layer in 3 (8%), and nerve fiber layer in 2 (5%). Also identified were subretinal fluid in 34 (92%), subretinal lipofuscin deposition in 35 (95%), and intraretinal edema in 6 (16%). Using EDI-OCT, a comparison with similar-sized choroidal nevus revealed that small choroidal melanoma showed increased tumor thickness, subretinal fluid, subretinal lipofuscin deposition, and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy. Statistically significant EDI-OCT features for small choroidal melanoma included intraretinal edema (P=.003), shaggy photoreceptors or loss of photoreceptors (P=.005), loss of external limiting membrane (P=.008), loss of inner segment-outer segment junction (P=.02), irregularity of inner plexiform layer (P=.04), and irregularity of ganglion cell layer (P=.04) (t test and Ï2 test). Shaggy photoreceptors were found overlying small choroidal melanoma in 18 (49%) but were not observed overlying choroidal nevus (P<.001).;Small choroidal melanoma tumor thickness was overestimated by 55% on ultrasonography compared with EDI-OCT.

This binding was independent of melanin content of cells and could be classified, based on competition experiments, as a Ro 5-4864-like binding type. Specific [3H]spiperone binding to these cell lines clearly revealed at least two types of binding sites: a low affinity, high capacity type of binding site (Kd greater than 100 nM, Bmax about 50 pmol/mg protein) and a high affinity, low capacity binding site (Kd less than 1 nm, Bmax 30 fmol/mg protein). Binding of spiperone to the low affinity, high capacity site appeared displaceable by NM 113 and dependent on melanin content of the cells and probably represents binding to melanin.

A few B16 cells penetrate the basement membrane and invade the connective tissue interior of the mesentery where they flatten out and assume a fibroblastic morphology.

Studies from several laboratories have implicated tumor cell adhesion and migration in response to laminin as a major contributing factor in tumor cell invasion. The current studies address the direct role of type IV collagen in promoting tumor cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. The observations of type IV collagen-mediated cellular behavior are contrasted with cellular behavior on type I collagen. The highly metastatic K1735 M4 melanoma cell line adhered, spread, and migrated in response to type IV collagen in a concentration-dependent manner. Functional assays using well-defined proteolytic fragments of type IV collagen demonstrated that melanoma cells interact with multiple domains of this protein. Highly metastatic melanoma cells adhered, spread, and exhibited motile behavior in response to 0.2 to 200 nM concentrations of a purified pepsin-generated, triple helix-rich domain of type IV collagen. In contrast, cells adhered and spread but were essentially nonmotile in response to a purified major noncollagenous domain of the protein. In addition, de novo protein synthesis was required for cell adhesion to the major noncollagenous domain, whereas adhesion to the helical domain was less dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-related peptides were used to study the adhesion and spreading of melanoma cells on type IV collagen. The results demonstrated that a serine containing RGD-related peptide (GRGDSP) has virtually no effect on melanoma cell adhesion on type IV collagen-coated substrata, whereas this peptide inhibited melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated substrata in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, when threonine was substituted for serine (GRGDTP), cell adhesion to type IV collagen was significantly (45%) inhibited. The threonine-containing peptide virtually eliminated cell adhesion on substrata coated with type I collagen. These data demonstrate that adhesion, spreading, and migration of melanoma cells on type IV collagen have a complex molecular basis which is partially dependent on RGD-related sequences.",

Previously, we have demonstrated that SFN inhibits the metastasis of B16F-10 melanoma cells in both in vivo and in vitro models. Melanomas are among the aggressive tumor types because of their notorious resistance to treatment and their high tendency to metastasize. In this study, we investigated the influence of SFN on the induction of apoptosis in B16F-10 melanoma cells, which was evidenced by morphological changes such as membrane blebbing, presence of apoptotic bodies, DNA condensation, and also by nuclear DNA fragmentation. SFN-induced apoptosis was associated with the activation of caspases 3 and 9, Bax, and p53 and the downregulation of Bcl-2, caspase-8, Bid, and NF-kB. Caspase-3 is a most likely candidate to mediate SFN-induced apoptosis. In addition to the caspase-dependent pathway, our results also showed the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, IL-12p40, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the nuclear translocation of factors kappa B (NF-ÎºB) p65, NF-ÎºB p50, NF-ÎºB c-Rel, c-FOS, ATF-2, and CREB-1 in SFN-induced apoptosis.

Hence there are few examples of genetically-related paired human melanoma cell lines for study in which one member of the pair is from a curable early-stage lesion and the partner is a more aggressive malignant variant. A rapid method of obtaining such variants is described. It consists of injecting cells from established early-stage radial growth phase or vertical growth phase melanoma cell lines--which are normally non- or poorly tumorigenic in nude mice--into such hosts, where the cell inoculum is co-mixed with Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane extract. This resulted in the rapid formation of progressively growing solid tumors from which permanent cell lines were established. Subsequently, the sublines were found to be frankly tumorigenic upon retransplantation into new nude mouse hosts in the absence of Matrigel co-injection. This process was repeated a second time, resulting in the isolation of secondary sublines, manifesting a stepwise increase in tumorigenic properties. The tumorigenic variant sublines were examined for their relative sensitivity to a panel of different cytokines that are normally growth inhibitory for melanoma cells from early-stage primary lesions. All the sublines were found to express an increased resistance to the cytokines transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and did so in a stable manner. Thus the results support the hypothesis that a progressive multicytokine resistance accompanies the progression of human melanoma. The availability of such related sublines should provide a valuable resource to help study the changes associated with, and perhaps causative of, disease progression in human malignant melanomas.",

Testing of numerous treatment strategies has identified dacarbazine as the most active single drug; however, its response rates in various clinical settings are quite limited. Defective apoptosis in combination with oncogenic proteins (such as activated Ras) in cell proliferation pathways plays a key part in both the development and disease progression of human melanoma. Farnesyl thiosalicylic acid, a novel Ras inhibitor, dislodges Ras proteins from the cell membrane, leading to inhibition of cell transformation and tumor growth. In this study we evaluated the effect of farnesyl thiosalicylic acid treatment on established human melanoma xenografts grown in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency as well as the chemosensitizing effect of farnesyl thiosalicylic acid in combination with dacarbazine. Daily administration of 10, 20, or 40 mg per kg of farnesyl thiosalicylic acid resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in tumor growth, with growth inhibition reaching a mean value of 45+/-7%, at the highest concentration. The combination of farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (10 mg per kg per day) and dacarbazine (80 mg per kg per day) resulted in a significant reduction of 56%+/-9%, in mean tumor growth. Analysis of toxicologic parameters (mouse weight, blood cell counts, and blood chemistry) showed an acceptable and similar toxicity profile for both the single-agent farnesyl thiosalicylic acid treatment and the combination of farnesyl thiosalicylic acid plus dacarbazine treatment. Given the observed preclinical treatment responses and the low toxicity, our results support the notion that farnesyl thiosalicylic acid in combination with dacarbazine may qualify as a rational treatment approach for human melanoma.",

Ten serum samples from five patients with stage II melanoma at 1 and 4 months prior to the clinical detection of recurrent disease were selected for study. The CIC were dissociated with low pH and ultrafiltered through a 100 x 10(3) dalton exclusion limit membrane. The low pH treatment resulted in an increase in antibody titer in eight of ten serum samples. The antibody activity in membrane immunofluorescence was quantitatively inhibited by the filtered antigen fraction and purified FA, suggesting the presence of anti-FA antibodies in the treated serum, which possibly were complexed with FA in the untreated sample. As determined by competitive inhibition in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the filtrate (antigen fraction) contained an antigen that was immunologically similar to FA. These results clearly demonstrate that FA, expressed on the cell surface of melanoma cells, is present in CIC of selected melanoma patients.",

The oncofetal antigen GPC3 is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored membrane protein and may be secreted. It is a novel tumor marker for human HCC: GPC3 protein was present in sera from 40-50% of HCC patients, but was not detected in sera from patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, or in sera from healthy individuals. alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) and PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II), are well known major tumor markers for HCC. Generally, AFP shows high positivity for HCC but also high false-positivity in detection assays. Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) is a recently described marker of HCC. Detection of AFP-L3 shows a much higher specificity than AFP, but a lower sensitivity. On the other hand, detection of PIVKA-II shows a lower false-positivity, but is not always sensitive enough to detect low levels secreted by small HCCs. There was no correlation between the three tumor markers, AFP, PIVKA-II, and GPC3 in terms of their presence in HCC cells. All three tumor markers showed similar positivity in patients with HCC, detecting 80% of patients with the disease. GPC3 is also a novel tumor marker for the diagnosis of human melanoma, especially in the early stages of the disease. Expression of GPC3 mRNA and protein was evident in tumor cells from >80% of patients with melanoma and melanocytic nevus, which is a common benign lesion. GPC3 protein was detected in sera from 40% (36/91) of melanoma patients, but not in sera from those with large congenital melanocytic nevus, or from healthy donors. Surprisingly, we detected serum GPC3 even in patients with stage 0, in situ melanoma. The positive detection rate of serum GPC3 at stage 0, I, and II (44.4%, 40.0%, 47.6%, respectively) was significantly higher than that of 5-S-cysteinyldopa, a well known tumor marker for melanoma (0.0%, 8.0%, and 10.0%, respectively). Interestingly, GPC3 was highly immunogenic in mice and elicited effective anti-tumor immunity with no evidence of autoimmunity. Thus, GPC3 is useful for diagnosis of HCC and melanoma and may also have a role in immunotherapy or tumor prevention. However, studies in humans are warranted.",

The antigen was measured in a double determinant enzyme immunoassay (DDEIA) using NKI/C-3 as catcher antibody. Results from in vitro experiments indicated that the antigen is actively shed from living cells. In sera from melanoma patients with a small tumor burden, the antigen concentrations were in the range of those of controls (0-22 U/ml). Significantly increased values (33-600 U/ml) were found in sera from patients with a moderate or large tumor burden. The antigen concentrations in sera from patients with multiple metastases of other tumors were within the range of controls. Several sera from patients with multiple metastases of colon, pancreatic, and stomach carcinoma, however, contained increased antigen concentrations (45-80 U/ml). These results correspond with the reactions of NKI/C-3 in tissue sections of some malignancies other than melanoma.

Pharmacological concentration of arsenic in combination with a widely known oxidant, menadione was explored in this study to synergistically sensitize malignant melanoma cells to apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of apoptosis and the signaling-pathways involved were thoroughly investigated. MATERIALS METHODS AND RESULTS: Menadione synergized NaAsO(2) to significantly increase ROS generation and facilitate the major apoptotic signaling events: alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 down-regulation and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 followed by poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 cleavage. Antioxidant N-acetyl-L: -cysteine antagonized these events. Investigation of the signaling-pathway revealed significant suppression of AP-1 activity but not NF-kappaB upon NaAsO(2) and menadione application. An increase in p38 phosphorylation and p53 protein expression did also dictate the apoptotic response. Suppression of p38 activation with SB203580 and inhibition of p53 expression by siRNA attenuated apoptosis. Transfection of p53, in p53 null HCT cells augmented the apoptotic events. Moreover, the treatment also led to tumor size reduction in BALB/c mice developed by intra-dermal B16 mouse melanoma cell injection; however, it had no detectable pro-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effect on non-tumor keratinocytes, normal fibroblasts or PBMC.;This study thus provides an insight into innovative mechanisms of melanoma sensitization, a proper cure against which is still elusive.

In vitro studies have suggested that the 72 kD type IV collagenase (MMP-2) may be important in melanoma invasion. It has recently been demonstrated that the expression of MMP-2 immunoreactive protein increased with increasing atypia in melanocytic tumours and was associated with later haematogenous metastases in melanoma. This paper investigates the value of MMP-2 as a possible prognostic marker in melanoma. The expression of MMP-2 immunoreactive protein was studied with immunoperoxidase staining in paraffin-embedded sections of 50 cases of primary skin melanoma by using specific, affinity purified antibodies. Positive immunostaining was quantified by counting the percentage of positive cancer cells and was compared with clinical patient characteristics and survival. Sixty-four per cent of the primary melanoma cases displayed positive cytoplasmic immunostaining for MMP-2 in tumour cells. Marked overexpression of MMP-2 protein (> or = 34 per cent of melanoma cells positive) correlated with the 5-year survival of the patients when compared with patients with lower MMP-2 positivity, 55 per cent vs. 85 per cent, respectively (P < 0.05). Male patients displayed positive staining more often than females (75 per cent vs. 54 per cent, respectively). There was no correlation between MMP-2 positivity and Clark level or Breslow classification. A distinct group with unfavourable prognosis was identified. The 10-year survival for MMP-2-positive male melanoma patients was 39 per cent as opposed to 79 per cent with the other melanoma patients (P < 0.05). In the hierarchic Cox regression model for survival, MMP-2 immunoreactive protein was found to be independent of Clark level and Breslow classification. Overexpression of MMP-2 protein indicated a 4.5-fold relative risk of dying from melanoma. It is concluded that MMP-2 immunoreactive protein in melanoma cells is an independent prognostic factor for survival. High MMP-2 expression in male melanoma patients indicates an unfavourable prognosis.",

In cultured WM-115 melanoma cells, curcumin induced mitochondrial membrane potential (MPP) decrease, cyclophilin-D (CyPD)-adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT-1) (two mPTP components) mitochondrial association and cytochrome C release, indicating mPTP opening. The mPTP blocker sanglifehrin A (SfA) and ANT-1 siRNA-depletion dramatically inhibited curcumin-induced cytochrome C release and WM-115 cell death. CyPD is required for curcumin-induced melanoma cell death. The CyPD inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) or CyPD siRNA-depletion inhibited curcumin-induced WM-115 cell death and apoptosis, while WM-115 cells with CyPD over-expression were hyper-sensitive to curcumin. Finally, we found that C6 ceramide enhanced curcumin-induced cytotoxicity probably through facilitating mPTP opening, while CsA and SfA as well as CyPD and ANT-1 siRNAs alleviated C6 ceramide's effect on curcumin in WM-115 cells. Together, these results suggest that curcumin-induced melanoma cell death is associated with mPTP opening.",

It also has a substantial affinity for malignant melanomas. This has been attributed to specific dopamine D2 receptor binding on melanoma cells because melanocytes and dopaminergic neurons share the same ectodermal origin and are both able to produce melanin. However, IBZM binding to melanoma metastases occurs predominantly 24 hr after injection, which is much later than maximal specific D2 receptor binding is expected. Furthermore, IBZM binding is not consistent in melanoma patients. This points to another mechanism of IBZM binding to melanoma cells. The aim of this study was to characterize IBZM-binding metastatic melanoma patients clinically and histologically to shed light on the nature of this mechanism.;Twenty-one patients with proven or suspected metastases of a malignant melanoma entered this prospective study after surgical removal of the primary tumor. Whole-body scans, planar scintigrams and SPECT scans were performed 2-5 hr and 1 day after intravenous injection of 185 MBq IBZM.;The suspected diagnosis of metastatic cancer was later confirmed in 17 patients by histology, clinical follow-up, x-ray, CT or other radiologic methods. Four patients were free of tumor tissue at the time of investigation and remained stable for 2 yr thereafter. Twelve of the 17 patients had a melanotic and 5 had an amelanotic subtype of the tumor. Iodine-123-IBZM accumulation occurred in the metastases of 10 of the 12 patients with melanotic melanoma and in 0 of the 5 patients with the amelanotic tumor type (p < 0.01; chi-square test). Furthermore, IBZM accumulation occurred in 0 of the 11 amelanotic metastases but in 20 of the 25 melanotic metastases (p < 0.001). The sensitivity is, thus, 83% for the detection of melanotic melanoma metastases on a patient basis and 80% on a lesion basis. Iodine-123-IBZM scintigraphy demonstrated one previously unknown metastasis. Six initially suspected lesions were not due to melanoma metastases and were IBZM-negative. No false-positive IBZM accumulations occurred in our patients.;Iodine-123-IBZM binds to melanotic malignant melanomas with high specificity and moderate sensitivity but not to amelanotic melanomas. Our data suggest that the tracer does not bind to membrane dopamine receptors of the tumor but is built in or closely bound to intracellular melanin.",

We show that both blocking Rap1 activation and expressing a constitutively active form of Rap1 reduced the ability of B16F1 melanoma cells to extravasate from the microvasculature and form metastatic lesions in the lungs. This correlated with a decreased ability of the tumor cells to undergo transendothelial migration (TEM) in vitro and form dynamic, F-actin-rich pseudopodia that penetrate capillary endothelial walls in vivo. Using multiple tumor cell lines, we show that the inability to form these membrane protrusions, which likely promote TEM and extravasation, can be explained by altered adhesion dynamics and impaired cell polarization that result when Rap1 activation or cycling is perturbed. Thus, targeting Rap1 could be a useful approach for reducing the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells that undergo active TEM.",

The promoter and adjacent regulatory sequences of the 92-kD type IV collagenase have been identified previously and three cis-acting elements homologous to the binding sites for AP-1, NF-KB and SP-1 proteins contributed to induction of the promoter activity by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in HT1080 cells. To date, no direct correlation between promoter activity and expression of the 92-kD type IV collagenase has been reported in normal or cancer cells. In this study, the effects of the transcriptional stimulation of the 92-kD type IV collagenase gene on the expression of the enzyme in human A2058 melanoma cells was analyzed by zymography experiments. Quantitative immunoblots using a monoclonal antibody that recognized specifically and exclusively the 92-kD type IV collagenase, confirmed that the 92-kD gelatinase was 92-kD type IV collagenase. Stimulation of the promoter activity resulted in increased gelatinase activity in the culture medium of A2058 cells. A direct correlation between TPA- and TNF-alpha-mediated promoter stimulation of the 92-kD type IV collagenase gene and its expression was also demonstrated in the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Interleukin-1 alpha failed to induce 92-kD gene promoter activity and type IV collagenase expression in melanoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines.

Clinical prognosis of aggressive neuroectodermal cancers remains dismal, therefore the search for novel therapies against such tumors is warranted. Curcumin is a phytochemical compound widely studied for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Recently, we have synthesized and tested in vitro various curcumin-related compounds in order to select new anti-tumor agents displaying stronger and selective growth inhibition activity on neuroectodermal tumors.;In this work, we have demonstrated that the new alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone D6 was more effective in inhibiting tumor cells growth when compared to curcumin. Normal fibroblasts proliferation was not affected by this treatment. Clonogenic assay showed a significant dose-dependent reduction in both melanoma and neuroblastoma colony formation only after D6 treatment. TUNEL assay, Annexin-V staining, caspases activation and PARP cleavage unveiled the ability of D6 to cause tumor cell death by triggering apoptosis, similarly to curcumin, but with a stronger and quicker extent. These apoptotic features appear to be associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. In vivo anti-tumor activity of curcumin and D6 was surveyed using sub-cutaneous melanoma and orthotopic neuroblastoma xenograft models. D6 treated mice exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth compared to both control and curcumin treated ones (Melanoma: D6 vs control: P < 0.001 and D6 vs curcumin P < 0.01; Neuroblastoma: D6 vs both control and curcumin: P < 0.001).;Our data indicate D6 as a good candidate to develop new therapies against neural crest-derived tumors.",

We found that STIM1 and Orai1 isoforms were abundantly expressed in human melanoma tissues and multiple melanoma/melanocyte cell lines. We confirmed that these cell lines exhibited SOCE, which was inhibited by knockdown of STIM1 or Orai1, or by a pharmacological SOCE inhibitor. Inhibition of SOCE suppressed melanoma cell proliferation and migration/metastasis. Induction of SOCE was associated with activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and was inhibited by inhibitors of calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) or Raf-1, suggesting that SOCE-mediated cellular functions are controlled via the CaMKII/Raf-1/ERK signaling pathway.

MIF inhibition showed shedding of melanoma antigens in the culture medium. Ethanol, methanol, formalin, trichloroacetic acid, and acetone yielded sharp MIF.

Cells cultured for six hours in medium supplemented with 0.5 mM pyridoxal took up and incorporated 13 and 32% less [3H]thymidine, respectively, than did control cultures. A 17% reduction in [3H]glucose uptake was observed at this time point. When the incubation time was decreased to three hours, an inhibition of cellular uptake of [3H]thymidine (22%), [3H]uridine (14%), and [3H]glucose (15%) was observed; however, little or no inhibition in incorporation was detected.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids were also increased in the latter group. The results indicate that in melanoma cells and in a percentage of normal melanocytes from melanoma patients, an imbalance in the antioxidant system can be detected that can lead to endogenous generation of reactive oxygen species and to cellular incapability of coping with exogenous peroxidative attacks.

NK cells select and differentiate both healthy and transformed stem-like cells, resulting in target cell maturation and shaping of their microenvironment. In our recent studies, we have observed that oral, pancreatic, and melanoma CSCs were capable of forming large tumors in humanized bone marrow, liver, thymus (hu-BLT) mice with fully reconstituted human immune system. In addition, major human immune subsets including NK cells, T cells, B cells, and monocytes were present in the spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood, and tumor microenvironment. Similar to our previously published in vitro data, CSCs differentiated with split anergized NK cells prior to implantation in mice formed smaller tumors. Intravenous injection of functionally potent osteoclast-expanded NK cells inhibited tumor growth through differentiation of CSCs in humanized mice. In this review, we present current approaches, advances, and existing limitations in studying interactions of the immune system with theÂ tumor, in particular NK cells with CSCs, using in vivo preclinical hu-BLT mouse model.

A predominantly epithelioid cell tumor appeared viable by light microscopy, and a low degree of mitotic activity persisted, despite therapy. The tumor cells, however, displayed degenerative changes ultrastructurally, presumably results of the radiotherapy. These consisted of numerous cytoskeletal filaments, lipid vacuoles, prominent phagolysosomes, and nuclear convolutions and fragmentations. The mitochondria were fewer in number in the present tumor than typically encountered in epithelioid cells. A rare leptomeric structure was discovered, probably an organizational modification of the cytoplasmic filaments. The tumor's capillaries showed radiation-induced changes in terms of thickened basement membranes and perivascular fibrin deposition. The foregoing features are indicative of cellular and metabolic injury from the radiotherapy, but these were evidently not sufficiently injurious to sterilize the tumor.",

Six stable hybridomas were cloned from six separate lymphocyte parents obtained from three patients. Ascites were obtained from nude mice after i.p. injection with cultured hybridoma cells. The monoclonal antibodies, four immunoglobulin Gs and two pentameric immunoglobulin Ms, were partially purified to remove mouse immunoglobulin and then conjugated to biotin for immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical studies. With the avidin:biotin:peroxidase complex method to detect and amplify binding by the biotin-conjugated human monoclonal antibodies, we found the six antibodies to be reactive against cytoplasmic determinants in five short-term melanoma cultures and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanoma tumors from four patients. The antigenic target of the antibodies identified was not carcinoembryonic antigen. Two antibodies, 2-139-1 and 6-26-3, were studied in more detail. Each stained 25 of 25 specimens of melanomas. Little or no reactivity was detected against fixed sections of normal skin, which included tissues such as epidermis, dermis, monocytes, lymphocytes, and vascular endothelium. More striking was the absence of binding to melanocytes in the basal layer of the skin or to pigmented nevus cells. Both antibodies showed cross-reactivity against other tumors, in particular colonic and prostatic carcinomas. In the normal colon, reactivity was restricted to the surface of the columnar epithelium; no reactivity was detected against normal prostatic epithelium. Reactivity was also not observed against liver and lung. However, the epithelia of the renal tubules, pancreatic ducts, and salivary ducts were all reactive. These human monoclonal antibodies identify cytoplasmic melanoma-associated tumor antigens that appear different from the membrane antigens defined by serological approaches and by most mouse monoclonal antibodies.",

In these studies we describe a melanoma cell system that should be useful in addressing the regulation of cell-matrix interactions and the roles they play in regulating differentiation and cell invasiveness. CS (suspension)-1 melanoma cells are relatively well differentiated: they are melanotic, responsive to melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and express TA99, a melanosome membrane differentiation marker. Their repertoire of integrin receptors for extracellular matrix ligands is limited; in particular, they lack receptors for vitronectin, accounting for the observation that they are nonadherent when cultured in the presence of serum. CS-1 cells are noninvasive as well, and express low levels of both metalloproteinases and activated plasminogen activators. Treatment of these cells with melanocyte-stimulating hormone causes them to increase melanin production and assume an arborized phenotype, suggesting that it promotes their further differentiation. In contrast, treatment of CS-1 with the thymidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine, converts them to a highly invasive cell population (termed BCS-1) that loses its differentiated properties and responsiveness to melanocyte-stimulating hormone, acquires a broad integrin repertoire (including vitronectin receptors), and expresses elevated levels of metalloproteinases and activated urokinase. From these observations and findings of others on BrdU treatment of other developmental lineages, we hypothesize that BrdU both suppresses differentiation and promotes invasiveness of CS-1 cells. The demonstrated manipulability of CS-1 cells should make them extremely useful for studying the regulation of both terminal differentiation and tumor progression in the melanocyte lineage.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The initial site of melanoma cell metastasis is frequently the regional lymph nodes, and the appearance of lymph node metastasis correlates with poor prognosis. Lymph node adhesion is mediated by an interaction between the tumor cell integrin alphavbeta3 and lymph node vitronectin. In this study, we explored the relationship between adhesion and proteolysis by examining the direct effect of vitronectin receptor ligation on matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) production by B16F1 and B16F10 melanoma cells. We report a dose-dependent increase in secretion of both MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) in response to vitronectin. Cellular invasiveness was also enhanced by vitronectin, as shown by the increased ability of vitronectin-treated cells to invade a synthetic basement membrane (Matrigel). Both the vitronectin-induced MMP-2 production and vitronectin-enhanced invasion were blocked by the peptide ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS). Furthermore, neither plasmin-degraded vitronectin nor the peptide ligand RGDS stimulated MMP-2 secretion or invasiveness, indicating that a multivalent ligand-receptor interaction rather than simple receptor occupancy was required for MMP-2 induction. MMP-2 and MMP-2/TIMP-2 interaction with the plasma membrane of melanoma cells resulted in enhanced catalytic activity against 14C-labeled gelatin, suggesting that membrane association may function in posttranslational regulation of MMP-2 activity. This is supported by data showing increased cellular invasion by cells containing membrane-bound MMP-2. Binding of proMMP-2 and proMMP-2/TIMP-2 to melanoma cells was not inhibited by RGDS, and melanoma cell adhesion to vitronectin was unaffected by pro- or active MMP-2, indicating that MMP-2 did not interact with the murine vitronectin receptor. Together, these data provide evidence for a functional link between adhesion and proteolysis and suggest a potential mechanism whereby adhesion of an invasive cell to the extracellular matrix regulates subsequent invasive behavior.",

Although it has been suggested previously that TASK-3 channels are expressed in the mitochondrial membranes, their role here remains elusive. In this study, a transient transfection of TASK-3 knockdown melanoma cell cultures was produced to show the significance of TASK-3 expression. Reduction of the TASK-3 protein biosynthesis induced characteristic changes in cell morphology, reduced the amount of DNA and decreased metabolic activity and mitochondrial function of melanoma cells when compared with control. These findings indicate that TASK-3 channel expression and function is indispensable for the proliferation and/or survival of the melanoma cells, as they seem to contribute to their mitochondrial functions. The significance is that, in this study, we have shown that TASK-3 channels are expressed in the mitochondria of melanoma malignum cells, and they are essential for maintaining cellular integrity and viability. The TASK-3 knockdown melanoma cell line had altered morphology, reduced DNA content, decreased metabolic activity and impaired mitochondrial function.

To address this issue, we used a complex of PIC and cationic liposome (PIC liposome) and examined its anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo. PIC liposome could directly suppress the growth of B16F10 melanoma in vitro and repeated peritumoral injections of PIC liposome inhibited melanoma growth in a dose-dependent manner. This treatment induced tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2)-tetramer(+) CD8(+) cells in the lymph nodes. As the mechanism for its anti-tumor immune response, we showed that the intradermal injection of PIC liposome induced the maturation of dendritic cells (DC). Moreover, the intratumoral injection of immature DC after treatment with PIC liposome significantly increased the number of TRP-2-specific IFN-gamma-producing cells in the lymph nodes as well as spleen, which resulted in an augmentation of the anti-tumor immune response.

However, the oncogenic signals that alter membrane homeostasis and their specific contribution to cancer progression remain unclear. Understanding the upstream drivers and downstream regulators of aberrant vesicular trafficking is distinctly important in melanoma. This disease is notorious for its inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Nevertheless, melanomas uniformly overexpress a cluster of endolysosomal genes, being particularly addicted to the membrane traffic regulator RAB7. Still, the underlying mechanisms and temporal determinants of this dependency have yet to be defined. Here we addressed these questions by combining electron microscopy, real time imaging and mechanistic analyses of vesicular trafficking in normal and malignant human melanocytic cells. This strategy revealed Class I PI3K as the key trigger of a hyperactive influx of macropinosomes that melanoma cells counteract via RAB7-mediated lysosomal degradation. In addition, gain- and loss-of-function in vitro studies followed by histopathological validation in clinical biopsies and genetically-engineered mouse models, traced back the requirement of RAB7 to the suppression of premature cellular senescence traits elicited in melanocytes by PI3K-inducing oncogenes. Together, these results provide new insight into the regulators and modes of action of RAB7, broadening the impact of endosomal fitness on melanoma development. ",

However, the molecular consequences of RAF inhibition in melanoma cells remained largely elusive. Here, we investigated the effects of the pan-RAF inhibitor L-779,450, which inhibited cell proliferation both in BRAF-mutated and wild-type melanoma cell lines. It furthermore enhanced apoptosis in combination with the death ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and overcame TRAIL resistance in melanoma cells. Enhanced apoptosis coincided with activation of mitochondrial pathways, seen by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Subsequently, caspase-9 and -3 were activated. Apoptosis induction by L-779,450/TRAIL was prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression and was dependent on Bax. Thus, activation of Bax by L-779,450 alone was demonstrated by Bax conformational changes, whereas Bak was not activated. Furthermore, the BH3-only protein Bim was upregulated in response to L-779,450. The significant roles of Smac, Bax, and Bim in this setting were proven by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown experiments. L-779,450 also resulted in morphological changes indicating autophagy confirmed by the autophagy marker light chain 3-II (LC3-II). The pro-apoptotic effects of L-779,450 may explain the antitumor effects of RAF inhibition and may be considered when evaluating RAF inhibitors for melanoma therapy. ",

Our results indicate that human A375 melanoma cells express 50-fold more PS than non-cancerous HaCaT cells. The expression of cell surface PS in various cancer cell lines closely correlated with their ability to be recognized, bound and killed by temporin-1CEa. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of temporin-1CEa against A375 cells can be ameliorated by annexin V, which binds to cell surface PS with high affinity. Moreover, the data of isothermal titration calorimetry assay further confirmed a direct binding of temporin-1CEa to PS, at a ratio of 1:5 (temporin-1CEa:PS). Interestingly, the circular dichroism spectra analysis using artificial biomembrane revealed that PS not only provides electrostatic attractive sites for temporin-1CEa but also confers the membrane-bound temporin-1CEa to form Î±-helical structure, therefore, enhances the affinity and membrane disrupting ability of temporin-1CEa.

To screen its target proteins, the recombinant ADAM15 disintegrin domain (RADD) was expressed in Escherichia coli, biotinylated and used in a protein pull-down assay in vitro. A total of eight kinds of proteins were identified by 2DE/LC-MS-MS. One of them, p38 kinase, was selected for further investigation of its involvement in the anti-proliferative effect of RADD on melanoma cells. Phosphorylation of p38 kinase in melanoma cells was detected upon treatment with RADD. Furthermore, the suppression of p38 kinase activity resulted in a decrease in the RADD inhibitory effect on melanoma cell proliferation. These results provide evidence that RADD inhibits melanoma cell proliferation partly through p38 kinase activation.",

These processes critically depend on the interaction of tumor cells with various extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Because only little quantitative information about expression of ECM gene products in general and expression in response to alterations of the surrounding environment is available, the present study was designed. Four human glioblastoma cell lines (U373MG, U138MG, U251MG, GaMG) as well as four human melanoma cell lines (MV3, BLM, 530, IF6) were tested with semiquantitative RT-PCR for their ability to express mRNA of different human ECM components (fibronectin, decorin, tenascin, collagen I, collagen IV, versican). In addition, two human medulloblastoma (MHH-Med 1, MHH-Med 4) and two fibrosarcoma (HT1080, U2OS) cell lines were analyzed. Cells which were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FCS expressed most of the analyzed protein components. When the same medium, but depleted of ECM proteins by filtrating through a membrane with cut-off at > 100 kD was used, basal mRNA expression of the ECM proteins was changed in most of the examined cell lines. Using serum free conditions, most of the cell lines again showed a variation in the expression pattern of mRNA encoding for the different ECM proteins compared to the other medium conditions. Comparing different cell lines from one tumor entity or different tumor groups, ECM expression was heterogeneous with regard to the different tumor entities as well as within the entities themselves. Migration assays revealed heterogeneous responses between the different cell lines, ECM components and culture conditions, making it difficult to correlate ECM expression patterns and migratory behavior. Our results revealed that all examined cell lines are able to produce ECM proteins in vitro. This suggests that tumor cells can modulate their microenvironment in vitro which has to be taken into consideration for studies related to migration and invasion.",

We used short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated RNA interference to knock down TF expression in the human metastatic melanoma cell line LOX-L. After transfection with the shRNA construct, 3 stable clones with significantly downregulated TF expression were established. They exhibited decreased proliferation in vitro as determined by (14)C thymidine incorporation and soft agar assay. The in vivo metastatic potential was assessed in an experimental pulmonary metastasis model in which cells from different clones were injected into the tail vein of nude mice. The incidence of pulmonary tumors was significantly lower in mice receiving shRNA-expressing cells (33% +/- 15%) than in control mice injected with wild-type cells or cells stably transfected with empty expression vector (90% +/- 10%). The mice injected with TF-downregulated cells had markedly longer survival time (69 +/- 17 days) compared to the control mice (35.6 +/- 5 days; p = 0.03). Thus, reduction of TF levels in LOX-L cells significantly delayed and reduced lung tumor formation. As a first step in elucidating the molecular basis for this effect, we compared the global gene expression profile in TF-downregulated cells and control cells by using cDNA microarray analysis. Forty-four known human genes were found to be significantly upregulated (> 2-fold; p < 0.05) and 228 genes significantly downregulated (>or= 3-fold; p < 0.05) in TF-downregulated cells compared to control cells. The differentially expressed genes encode proteins functioning in transcription, translation, cell communication and cell growth/death. The results provide a basis for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of TF on the metastatic capacity of LOX-L melanoma cells.",

In this study, we compared the growth and behavior of four melanoma cell lines originating from primary and metastatic human cutaneous melanomas (AN, RU, M14, and WK) in in-vitro human skin equivalents (HSEs) generated with four different dermal matrices: human fibroblast-seeded rat tail collagen, human fibroblast-derived matrix (FDM), noncellular human de-epidermized dermis (DED), and a novel fully cellular human DED with an intact pre-existent basement membrane. Melanoma cells showed proliferation in all HSEs, indicating that the microenvironment formed in all HSEs studied here allows the growth of melanoma cells in concert with epidermal keratinocytes for multiple weeks in vitro. Melanoma cells did not affect epidermal proliferation and terminal differentiation. Growth of melanoma cells in the dermal compartment, as a measure of invasive potential, differs markedly between the four types of in-vitro human melanoma models. Notably, the growth of melanoma cells in the dermal matrix was observed in all HSEs cultured with cell lines originating from metastatic melanoma, except for cDED-based HSEs, and the growth of melanoma cells of nonmetastatic origin was observed in the dermal compartment of FDM-based HSEs.

Integrins are cell surface molecules which mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions and are likely to be important for tumor cell survival and dissemination. The purpose of this study was to characterize the integrin and proteolytic enzyme repertoire from low (A375P), medium (A375M) and high metastatic (A375SM) human melanoma cell lines. These cell lines are also invasive through human amniotic membranes in vitro and their invasiveness parallels the reported metastatic phenotype. The types and levels of expression of the various integrin receptors were analysed by quantitative immunoprecipitation using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed to known integrin subunits. In addition, cDNA probes to the integrin subunits were used in quantitative northern blot analysis. These data show that the integrin alpha v beta 3 increases 50- to 100-fold as these cells progress to a more metastatic phenotype. alpha 4 beta 1 levels also appeared to increase several fold, while other beta 1 integrins did not differ in their expression levels. The increased alpha v beta 3 expression in the more metastatic cells resulted in an increased adhesion to vitronectin and fibrinogen substrates in cell attachment assays. However, alpha v- and beta 3-specific antibodies did not inhibit A375 cell invasion through the amnion. Each cell line was found to release similar quantities of a 72-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase and tissue type plasminogen activator.

Accordingly, our aim was to establish in vitro models to examine (a) the influence of sex steroids and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) on tumour invasion and the influence of (b) ECM proteins and (c) adjacent cells on melanoma invasion. In the first model, melanoma cell invasion through fibronectin over 20 hr under serum-free conditions was used to investigate the effects of 17beta-oestradiol and oestrone on the invasion of human melanoma cell lines, A375-SM and HBL. A375-SM, but not HBL cells, proved very susceptible to inhibition by female steroids. However, invasion of the HBL line was inhibited by alpha-MSH. Using the second model of reconstructed human skin based on de-epidermised acellular dermis, we found that the HBL cells on their own failed to invade into the dermis (irrespective of the presence or absence of the basement membrane). However, there was a significant synergistic interaction between keratinocytes, fibroblasts and HBL cells, such that a modest invasion of HBLs into the dermis was seen within 2 weeks when other skin cells were present. In contrast, A375-SM cells showed a significant ability to invade the dermis in the absence of other cells, with less invasion when other skin cells were present. In summary, these models have provided new information on the extent to which melanoma cell invasion is sensitive to oestrogenic steroids and to alpha-MSH and to interaction, not only with adjacent skin cells but also to the presence of basement membrane antigens.",

The immunostaining of Cx26 showed no noticeable change after electroporation at different time points. However, Western blot showed a significant reduction in Cx26 30 min after electroporation. Our results showed that electroporation interferes transiently in the expression of Connexin 26 in melanoma and are consistent with the idea that electroporation is a process of intense stress that promotes cell homeostatic imbalance and results in disruption of cell physiological processes such as transcription and translation.",

At the cellular level constitutive activation of transcriptional regulators of the hypoxic response leads to the emergence of clones with aggressive phenotypes. The primary interface between the cell and the hypoxic environment is the plasma membrane. A detailed investigation of this organelle is expected to yield further targets for therapeutic perturbation of the response to hypoxia. In the present study, quantitative proteomic analysis of plasma membrane from hypoxia-adapted murine B16F10 melanoma was performed using differential 16O/18O stable isotopic labeling and multidimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The analysis resulted in the identification of 24,853 tryptic peptides, providing quantitative information for 2,433 proteins. For a subset of plasma membrane and secreted proteins, quantitative RT-PCR was used to gain further insight into the genomic regulatory events underlying the response to hypoxia. Consistent increases at the proteomic and transcriptomic levels were observed for aminopeptidase N (CD13), carbonic anhydrase IX, potassium-transporting ATPase, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and stromal cell derived factor I (SDF-1). Antibody-based analysis of a panel of human melanoma cell lines confirmed that CD13 and SDF-1 were consistently upregulated during hypoxia.

Clinical imaging of cell-death may be useful in addressing this need, as induction of tumor cell-death is the primary mechanism of action of most anticancer drugs. In this study, we examined the performance of N,N'-Didansyl-L-cystine (DDC), a member of the ApoSense family of novel small molecule detectors of cell-death, as a potential tool for monitoring cell-death in cancer models. Detection of cell-death by DDC was examined in fluorescent studies on B16 melanoma cells both in vitro and ex vivo following its in vivo administration. In vitro, DDC manifested selective uptake and accumulation within apoptotic cells that was highly correlated with Annexin-V binding, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase activation. Uptake was not ATP-dependent, and was inducible by calcium mobilization. In vivo, DDC selectively targeted cells undergoing cell-death in melanoma tumors, while not binding to viable tumor cells. Chemotherapy caused marked tumor cell-death, evidenced by increased DDC uptake, which occurred before a detectable change in tumor size and was associated with increased animal survival. These data confirm the usefulness of imaging of cell-death by DDC as a tool for early monitoring of tumor response to anti-cancer therapy.",

There is no therapy for advanced-stage melanoma and its metastasis because of their high resistance to various anticancer therapies. Human skin is an important metabolic organ in which occurs photoinduced synthesis of vitamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). 7-DHC, the precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis, is highly reactive and easily modifiable to produce 7-DHC-derived compounds. The intracellular levels of 7-DHC or its derivatives can have deleterious effects on cellular functionality and viability. In this study we evaluated the effects on melanoma cell lines of 7-DHC as such and for this aim we used much care to minimize 7-DHC modifications. We found that from 12 to 72 h of treatment 82-86% of 7-DHC entered the cells, and the levels of 7-DHC-derived compounds were not significant. Simultaneously, reactive oxygen species production was significantly increased already after 2h. After 24 h and up to 72 h, 7-DHC-treated melanoma cells showed a reduction in cell growth and viability. The cytotoxic effect of 7-DHC was associated with an increase in Bax levels, decrease in Bcl-2/Bax ratio, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in apoptosis-inducing factor levels, unchanged caspase-3 activity, and absence of cleavage of PARP-1. These findings could explain the mechanism through which 7-DHC exerts its cytotoxic effects. This is the first report in which the biological effects found in melanoma cells are mainly attributable to 7-DHC as such.",

By cell binding analysis, 155.8 was shown to react with seven of eight cultured melanoma cell lines, but not with a variety of lymphoblastoid cell lines or cultured tumor cells derived from other solid tumor types. Indirect immunoprecipitation of the 155.8 antigen from intrinsically labeled melanoma cells revealed a glycoprotein of Mr = 250,000 and a sulfated molecule of Mr greater than 400,000. The antigen was identified as a chondroitin sulfate type A/C proteoglycan synthesized by melanoma cells on the basis of its sensitivity to chondroitinase ABC digestion and the identification of sulfated glycosaminoglycans released from the antigen immunoprecipitated by 155.8. The determinants recognized by antibodies 155.8 and 9.2.27, another anti-chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, immunoprecipitate only a proteoglycan from high density cesium chloride gradient fractions, (1.487 g/liter); however, they immunoprecipitate a free glycoprotein of Mr = 250,000 from low density fractions (1.317 g/liter). This demonstrated that the 155.8 and 9.2.27 determinants, both of which reside on the glycoprotein of Mr = 250,000, are also present in the proteoglycan, suggesting that this glycoprotein is the proteoglycan core protein. Monoclonal antibody 155.8 reacts with a determinant on the core protein distinct from that recognized by 9.2.27. Proteoglycans bearing 155.8 determinants are distributed on the surface of cultured melanoma cells in a punctated fashion that apparently resolves to short, filamentous structures at high magnification.

In this study, our findings show that SD suppresses cell multiplication and diminishes membrane permeability for ethidium bromide (EB), a model marker used to measure cell permeability for CaÂ²âº ions. SD also decreases protein levels of COX-2, and increases degradation of phospholipases PLAâ and PLC(Î³)1 and diminishes enzymatic activity of the CaÂ²âº-dependent cPLAâ. This lower membrane permeability for CaÂ²âº-ions, associated with SD, is most likely due to the diminished content of lysophosphosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) within cell membranes caused by the effect of SD on PLAâ. The decrease in diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IPâ) due to inhibition of PLC(Î³)1, leads to the downregulation of CaÂ²âº-dependent processes within the cell and also inhibits the formation of tumors.

The first, found in Sephadex fraction II and PAGE region a appears specific for melanoma. Allogeneic extracts have produced positive reactions in many patients with skin or ocular melanoma, and have given negative reactions in patients with other types of cancer or in patients with ocular lesions simulating melanoma. The second group of antigens, in Sephadex fraction III and PAGE region b were less specific. These antigens produced positive skin reactions in some patients with breast cancer, as well as in patients with melanoma. Reactivity to PAGE region a appeared to be confined to one protein band, but three different bands in region b gave positive reactions. A study was made of the presence or absence of similar antigens in metastatic deposits of malignant melanoma. Metastatic lesions in the following tissues were analyzed: liver, lung, adrenal, skin, and colon. These were compared with pooled primary skin melanomas by skin testing in the same patients. The tumor-associated melanoma antigen, found in Sephadex fraction II and PAGE region a appeared to be strongest in adrenal, lung, and liver metastases. It was found that the protein yield in this region was not indicative of the strength of the antigen. Therefore, a careful, detailed analysis of the protein bands present in PAGE regions a and b from primary skin melanoma was conducted. Only one band in PAGE region a was found to be responsible for positive skin reactivity. This band was found to be a glycolipoprotein. Further studies were also conducted in order to determine whether or not some of the antigens present might be fetal antigens. Some of the protein bands present in Sephadex fraction III and PAGE region b of melanoma appeared to be similar to some of the PAGE region b proteins present in fetal skin cells. Two bands from fetal skin also had the same location on PAGE as two bands from ductal breast cancer, although the relationship to melanoma region b antigens was not exact. These fetal proteins, which seemed to be present both in ductal breast cancer cell membranes and in melanoma cell membranes, might account for the positive skin reactivity seen in this region, and also for the cross reactivity of skin tests with this antigen.",

Under normal physiological conditions degradation of the ECM is a finely regulated process, and altered homeostasis of ECM degradation (excessive or insufficient) is associated with many diseases [2-5] such as cancer, fibrosis, arthritis, nephritis, encephalomyelitis and chronic ulcers. The remodeling of the ECM is carried out by a family of enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). MMPs constitute a large group of multidomain, zinc dependent endopeptidases capable of hydrolyzing all protein components of the ECM [6]. Additional functions of MMPs have also been identified. MMPs, and in particular MT1-MMP, the prototypic membrane-tethered matrix metalloproteinase, are no longer only ECM remodeling enzymes but rather regulators of several cellular functions including growth, migration, invasion and gene expression. Here we will focus on the role of the membrane bound MT1-MMP in melanoma growth, invasion and metastasis. MT1-MMP has in fact emerged as a multifaceted protease capable of influencing melanoma metastasis by canonical means, i.e. ECM degradation, but also via regulation of genes involved in several pro-tumorigenic functions including tumor cell growth and motility.

We recently showed that down-regulation of O-acetyl-GD3 expression in hamster melanoma cells by introducing the influenza C virus O-acetylesterase cDNA into the cells resulted in induction of dendricity, with a concomitant increased expression of GD3. To examine the effect of the increased GD3 expression in the plasma membrane on the dendricity of the AbC-1 cells, we first established the cDNA coding for hamster GD3-synthase. We then targeted the sialyltransferase gene expression by the antisense knockdown experiment, and the results showed that inhibition of the expression of gangliosides GD3 and O-acetyl-GD3 induced dendricity in the hamster melanoma AbC-1 cell line. These GD3- and O-acetyl-GD3-depleted cells also demonstrated a decreased rate of cell growth, but their melanogenic potential was not affected. These results rule out the possibility that GD3 may serve as an active molecule for dendrite outgrowth in this cell line and suggest that the enhanced expression of O-acetyl-GD3 ganglioside may stimulate cellular growth and suppress certain differentiated phenotypes such as dendrite formation, but not melanogenesis, in our system.",

Whereas the proapoptotic protein Bim was activated and localized to the mitochondrial membrane in all cell lines regardless of apoptotic sensitivity, Bmf activation and cytosolic translocation was exclusive to sensitive cells. In resistant cells, Bmf remained sequestered to the cytoskeleton through dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) binding. Overexpression of Bmf in resistant cells did not enhance apoptosis, whereas expression of mutant BmfA69P, which has decreased binding to DLC2, promoted cell death. Expression of BmfA69P mutants possessing the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain mutation L138A, which impairs BH3 interactions, did not enhance apoptosis in resistant cells. RNA interference targeting Bim and Bmf provided protection from apoptosis induced by MEK inhibition. These results show a novel role for Bmf in promoting apoptosis and provide insight into the mechanism of apoptotic resistance to MEK inhibition in melanoma.",

PCR array data showed that M2 had a higher expression of several matrix metalloproteinase proteins (MMPs) compared to M1.

To support the search for possible sensitizers, we explored the effects of the cellular oncoproteins c-Myc and N-Ras, which can decrease the clonogenic potential of irradiated p53-negative IGR39D melanoma cells. Using stable transfectants of this cell line, we showed that mutant N-Ras decreased the proliferation rate by inducing a prolonged cell cycle arrest. In contrast, c-Myc made these melanoma cells more prone to radiation-induced cell death. Membrane blebbing, the formation of apoptotic bodies and caspase activation, as measured by cleavage of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) substrate and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), indicate that these cells die by an apoptotic process. c-Myc also sensitized these p53-deficient melanoma cells to treatment with various cytotoxic drugs and heat shock. Similar results were obtained in inducible c-Myc models of IGR39D and in another melanoma cell line, 9007, which expresses functional p53. Together, these findings indicate that c-Myc is capable of sensitizing typically resistant tumour cells and that this occurs irrespective of the functional status of the p53 protein.

The expression of biomarkers can be detected intracellularly or on the cell membrane of melanoma cells or noncancer cells in association with the melanoma. Some of these molecules can then be released extracellularly and be found in body fluids such as the serum. Actually, with the emergence of new targeted therapies for cancer and the increasing range of therapeutic options, the challenge for the clinician is to assess the unique risk/response ratio and the prognosis for each patient. New serum biomarkers of melanoma progression and metastatic disease are still awaited in order to provide efficient rationale for followup and treatment choices. LDH as well as S100B levels have been correlated with poor prognosis in AJCC stage III/IV melanoma patients.

In this study, we engineered murine B16 melanoma cells to secrete high levels of soluble TWEAK and examined their properties. TWEAK production by B16 cells preferentially activated the non-canonical NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and increased the expression of several previously described TWEAK-inducible genes, including Fn14. TWEAK overexpression in B16 cells inhibited both cell growth and invasion in vitro. The TWEAK-mediated reduction in B16 cell invasive capacity was dependent on activation of the non-canonical NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Finally, we found that this same signaling pathway was also important for TWEAK-stimulated human DU145 prostate cancer cell invasion. Therefore, even though TWEAK:Fn14 binding activates non-canonical NF-ÎºB signaling in both melanoma and prostate cancer cells, this shared cellular response can trigger a very different downstream outcome (inhibition or stimulation of cell invasiveness, respectively).",

Parthenolide, an active component of feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), inhibits proliferation and kills various cancer cells mainly by inducing apoptosis. The aim of the study was to examine anticancer effects of parthenolide in melanoma cells in vitro. The cytotoxicity of parthenolide was tested in melanoma cell lines and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells directly derived from a surgical excision. Adherent cell proliferation was measured by tetrazolium derivative reduction assay. Loss of the plasma membrane integrity, hypodiploid events, reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, and caspase-3 activity were assessed by flow cytometric analysis. Microscopy was used to observe morphological changes and cell detachment. Parthenolide reduced the number of viable adherent cells in melanoma cultures. Half maximal inhibitory concentration values around 4 mumol/l were determined. Cell death accompanied by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase-3 activation was observed as the result of parthenolide application. Interestingly, the melanoma cells from vertical growth phase and melanocytes were less susceptible to parthenolide-induced cell death than metastatic cells when drug concentration was at least 6 mumol/l. Reactive oxygen species level was not significantly increased in melanoma cells. However, preincubation of parthenolide with the thiol nucleophile N-acetyl-cysteine protected melanoma cells from parthenolide-induced cell death suggesting the reaction with intracellular thiols as the mechanism responsible for parthenolide activity. In conclusion, the observed anticancer activity makes parthenolide an attractive drug candidate for further testing in melanoma therapy.",

The plasma membrane enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), which plays a crucial role in cellular handling of thiols, is often expressed in malignant tumors, including melanoma, although its expression levels may vary widely among different tumors or cells of the same tumor. In an attempt to better understand the functional significance of GGT overexpression, we have examined the relationships between intra- and extra-cellular thiol metabolism and GGT expression. Intra- and extra-cellular distribution of glutathione and other low mol. wt. thiols and disulfides was investigated in two different Me665/2 human melanoma clones that originated from the same metastasis, but exhibiting high (2/60 clone) and low (2/21 clone) GGT activity. Intracellular content of glutathione was lower in GGT-rich 2/60 cells, in spite of high GGT expression. A lower utilization of extracellular cystine was also observed in these cells. In both clones, a direct secretion of cysteine in the extracellular medium was detected, which was independent of GGT-mediated catabolism of extracellular glutathione. Substantial amounts of glutathione, GSSG and glutathione-cysteine disulfide were accumulated extracellularly only in the case of GGT-poor 2/21 cells, while the same event was apparent in 2/60 cells only after the following inhibition of GGT activity. When exposed to the trinuclear platinum compound BBR 3464 or hydrogen peroxide, which are very reactive for sulfur-containing nucleophiles, the 2/60 clone showed higher sensitivity than the 2/21 clone to both agents. These results suggest that the clone-specific balance between transport of sulfur aminoacids and GGT activity results in profound differences in the capability of each clone to modify the thiol redox status of the extracellular milieu. The finding may have important implications in tumor cell behavior with particular reference to chemosensitivity, since thiols are recognized factors in modulation of cell sensitivity to platinum-based anticancer drugs.",

B16 cell lines were examined for rates of de novo glutathione synthesis from extracellular glutathione and for their sensitivity to gamma-irradiation and glutathione synthesis inhibition. The GGTP inhibitors were examined for their effect on the radiosensitivity of B16 melanoma cells.;B16-F10-BL6 (BL6) melanoma cells were shown to express a 20-fold higher level of GGTP than the B16-F1 melanoma variant cells. Cultures of BL6 and B16-F1 cells depleted extracellular glutathione at rates of 2.4 and < 0.1 nmol glutathione/10(6) cells/h, respectively, and BL6 cells exported glutathione at a rate 7.2-fold higher than B16-F1 cells (710 and 98 pmol glutathione/10(6) cells/h, respectively). BL6 melanoma cells replenished exhausted intracellular glutathione levels from an extracellular glutathione source at a rate of 1.21 nmol glutathione/h (18% basal glutathione/h); however, B16-F1 cells lacked the capacity to replenish intracellular glutathione despite the presence of exogenous glutathione in the culture medium. BL6 melanoma cells were radioresistant compared to the B16-F1 cell line, exhibiting extrapolation numbers (Ã±) of 14.9 and 1.0, respectively, and a lower surviving fraction to a wide range of radiation doses. The GGTP inhibitor combination of L-serine and sodium borate blocked the repletion of intracellular glutathione and in the presence or absence of buthionine sulfoximine-mediated depletion of glutathione reverses the radiation resistance in BL6 melanoma cells to near baseline levels observed with the B16-F1 parent clone. Serine-borate treatment of low-GGTP expressing B16-F1 cells had no effect on the Ã± value or the surviving fraction of cells to a range of ionizing irradiation doses.;These results suggest that GGTP plays an important role in the extracellular metabolism and transport of glutathione, which also provides radioresistance to BL6 melanoma cells in vitro.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In the preceding paper we have demonstrated an increase in presentation of both major histocompatibility complex antigens (MHC) and a tumor-associated antigen of the weakly immunogenic B16 melanoma by a straight-forward technique. The method consists in modulating the tumor cell membrane by hydrostatic pressure and simultaneous chemical crosslinking of the cell-surface proteins. In B16-BL6 melanoma, the induced antigenic modulation was found to persist for over 48 h, which permitted the evaluation of the ability of modified B16-BL6 cells to induce immunity against unmodified B16-BL6 cells. In the present study, we have shown that a significant systemic immunity was induced only in mice that were immunized with modified B16-BL6 melanoma cells, whereas immunization with unmodified B16-BL6 cells had only a marginal effect when compared to the results in control sham-immunized mice. The induced immunity was specific since a single immunization affected the growth of B16-BL6 tumors but had no effect on MCA 106, an antigenically unrelated tumor. The addition of interleukin-2 to the immunization regimen had no effect on the antitumor responses induced by the modified B16-BL6 cells. The cell-mediated immunity conferred by immunization with treated B16-BL6 cells was confirmed in experiments in vitro where splenocytes from immunized mice could be sensitized to proliferate by the presence of B16-BL6 cells. In addition, the altered antigenicity of these melanoma cells appeared to correlate with their increased susceptibility to specific effectors. Thus, 51Cr-labeled B16-BL6 target cells, modified by pressure and crosslinking, in comparison to control labeled target cells, were lysed in much greater numbers by effectors such as lymphokine-activated killer cells and allogeneic cytotoxic lymphocytes (anti-H-2b), while such cells remained resistant to lysis by natural killer cells. Our findings indicate that the physical and chemical modifications of the tumor cells that are described here may be considered as a simple yet effective method for the preparation of tumor vaccines, which could be applied in tumor-bearing hosts.",

Recently, TIM-3 was reported to be expressed aberrantly in melanoma cells, contributing to the low adhesion ability of tumor cells and promoting the survival of melanoma cells. We investigated TIM-3 expression in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), and further analyzed whether the aberrant expression of TIM-3 is related to the prognosis for patients with lung cancer. Tumor tissue samples from 30 patients with NSCLC were involved. Results of immunohistochemical analysis showed that TIM-3 stained positive on tumor cells in 86.7% (26/30) patients with primary NSCLC. The TIM-3 expression in NSCLC tumor cells was correlated with histologic type and pathologic T classification of the disease (P < .05). More importantly, patients with TIM-3-positive tumor cells had a significantly shorter survival time than those with TIM-3-negative tumors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the significant role of TIM-3 expression in tumor cells as an independent prognostic factor for patients with NSCLC (relative risk, 4.481; 95% confidence interval, 1.790-11.22; P = .0005).

Melanoma A375 cells were transfected with siRNAs directed against gelsolin. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the level of gelsolin. The ability of actin to inhibit DNase I activity was used to quantify monomeric and total actin level and calculate the state of actin polymerization. Fluorescence confocal microscopy was applied to observe gelsolin and vinculin distribution along with actin cytoskeleton organization.;Increased level of gelsolin expression leads to its accumulation at the submembranous region of the cell accompanied by distinct changes in the state of actin polymerization and an increase in the migration of LS180 cells. In addition, LS180 cells overexpressing gelsolin form podosome-like structures as indicated by vinculin redistribution and its colocalization with gelsolin and actin.

We examined the effect of TNF-alpha on melanoma expression/activation of type IV gelatinases matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMPs -2 and -9) and general proteolytic enzymes. Stimulation with TNF-alpha significantly increased both melanoma cell migration at 24 h (+21%) and invasion through fibronectin (+35%) but did not upregulate/activate the expression of latent MMP-2 constitutively produced by these cells and did not upregulate their general protease activity. However, the increased cell migration and invasion through fibronectin observed following stimulation with TNF-alpha were inhibited by the general protease inhibitor alpha(2) macroglobulin. These findings suggest that the promigratory and proinvasive effect of TNF-alpha on this melanoma cell line may be mediated to some extent by induction of localised cell membrane-bound degradative enzyme activity, which is not readily detected in biochemical assays.",

As an exception from this rule, patients with regional or solitary metastases may be treated vigorously to improve survival: However, (a) regional tumor resection with or without radiotherapy; (b) regional perfusion of tumor-bearing extremities, and (c) indicator chemotherapy, followed by the resection of solitary metastases and sometimes secondary adjuvant treatment with the same cytostatic regimen, will cure only about 20% of these patients. Systemic treatment with cytostatic agents given alone or in combination fail to reproducibly reach an objective remission rate of more than 20% or a gain in median survival of more than 6 months. The addition of biomodulators may even worsen these results and endocrine treatments are rarely helpful. Current research therefore concentrates on defining a well selected patient population with skin-, soft tissues-, and lung-metastases, who will benefit from systemic treatment, as well as on the development of drug derivatives with fewer side effects. Another small step forward may be expected from sophisticated techniques such as linking cytotoxins to monoclonal antibodies for selective cell killing, or rendering tumor cell membranes vulnerable to endogenous and/or exogenous attacks by altering their structure with the help of biomodulators (Interferons, DNCB etc.), or priming lymphokine-activated killer cells for specific lysis of vital tumor-associated antigens.

Tumor cells may escape from NK lysis by counteracting NK cytotoxicity activating signals with inhibitory ones. Among the molecules that mediate an NK inhibitory signal, HLA-G1, a non-classical MHC Class I antigen, is of particular interest. HLA-G1 is ectopically expressed in various tumors, including melanoma and constitutes the major NK inhibitory ligand in the M8 melanoma cell line when coexpressed with HLA-A, -B, -C and -E molecules. We have evaluated the balance between 2 powerful signals that affect NK cell tumor lysis, one inhibitory and the other one activating, respectively HLA-G1 and MICA. For this purpose, we transfected the M8 melanoma cell line, which spontaneously expresses MICA, with HLA-G1 cDNA, using it as a target for the NKL effector. We carried out cytotoxicity assays, using antibodies that disrupt interactions between the MICA and HLA-G1 ligands and their respective NK effector counterparts, the NKG2D activating and ILT2 inhibitory receptors. Results showed that 1) MICA expressed in the M8 melanoma cell line triggered NK cell tumor lysis and 2) HLA-G1 coexpression mediated the inhibition of NK cytotoxicity by mitigating the MICA activating signal. HLA-G1 expression in a tumor cell line in which MICA is switched on would therefore appear to be a powerful way to turn off NK cells, supporting the emerging idea that the balance between positive and negative NK cytolysis signals critically influences tumor progression.",

NADH oxidase activity was inhibited preferentially in the A-375 melanoma cells but not in the primary melanocytes, by capsaicin. Inhibition of growth and the NADH oxidase by capsaicin could be induced in resistant SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells by co-administration of capsaicin with t-butyl hydroperoxide, a mild oxidising agent. Death of the inhibited cells was accompanied by nuclear changes suggestive of apoptosis. With B16 mouse melanoma, capsaicin inhibited both the NADH oxidase activity and growth in culture. Growth of B16 melanoma, transplanted in C57BL/6 mice, was significantly inhibited by capsaicin injected directly into the tumour site when co-administered with t-butyl hydroperoxide.

Metabolic profiles for two groups of human G3361 melanoma cells were compared, i.e. wildtype melanoma cells with intact ABCB5 expression (ABCB5-WT) and corresponding melanoma cell variants with inhibited ABCB5 expression, through shRNA-mediated gene knockdown (ABCB5-KD). A comprehensive metabolomic analysis was performed by using proton and phosphorus NMR spectroscopy of cell extracts to examine water-soluble metabolites and lipids. Parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis of absolute and relative metabolite levels yielded significant differences for compounds involved in glucose, amino acid and phospholipid (PL) metabolism. By contrast, energy metabolism was virtually unaffected by ABCB5 expression. The sum of water-soluble metabolites per total protein was 17% higher in ABCB5-WT vs. ABCB5-KD G3361 variants, but no difference was found for the sum of PLs. Enhanced abundance was particularly pronounced for lactate (+ 23%) and alanine (+ 26%), suggesting an increase in glycolysis and potentially glutaminolysis. Increases in PL degradation products, glycerophosphocholine and glycerophosphoethanolamine (+ 85 and 123%, respectively), and redistributions within the PL pool suggested enhanced membrane PL turnover as a consequence of ABCB5 expression. The possibility of glycolysis modulation by an ABCB5-dependent IL1Î²-mediated mechanism was supported by functional studies employing monoclonal antibody (mAb)-dependent ABCB5 protein inhibition in wildtype G3361 melanoma cells. Our metabolomic results suggest that the underlying biochemical pathways may offer targets for melanoma therapy, potentially in combination with other treatment forms. ",

(Shields et al. 1991) Although new diagnostic and therapeutic tools have been developed during the most recent years, only the eye conservation rate has been achieved, while the survival rate remains poor. The reason for this liver-homing is largely unknown, but it is conceivable that hepatic environmental factors may be implicated in the growth, dissemination, and progression of this malignancy. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) that binds to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is mainly produced in the liver. It has been shown to be crucial for tumor transformation, maintenance of malignant phenotype, promotion of cell growth, and prevention of apoptosis. (Baserga 1995) The hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is another growth factor produced in the liver and exerts its biological effects through binding to the plasma membrane receptor c-Met. The activation of this receptor by HGF/SF ligand can induce proliferation, motility, adhesion, and invasion of tumor cells. (Cruz et al. 2003) Metastasis is a process involving many components, including tumor cell adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis, and invasion. The tumor cells undergo intravasation, disperse via the vascular and the lymphatic systems, and finally extravasate to invade the secondary sites. In all these steps, proteolytic enzyme systems are involved, including the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system and the plasminogen activation system. The migration of a malignant cell through the ECM and the basement membrane requires proteolytic activities. (Stetler-Stevenson et al. 1993). Efforts to target the IGF-I system has been made with different types of cancer but not with uveal melanoma.",

Stimulation of CD8+ T cells from melanoma patients with HR-gp100-loaded DC was visualized by confocal microscopy using stained target cells, and was quantitatively measured by the production of IFN-gamma using an ELISPOT assay. The results showed that HR-gp100 protein, produced either in bacteria or in yeast, when loaded on DC from melanoma patients, stimulated autologous CD8+ lymphocytes. By direct visualization, these lymphocytes were found in close contact with dead melanoma cells, and to contain membrane material transferred from stained melanoma cells; in cultures containing control lymphocytes stimulated with unloaded DC, no melanoma cell killing was observed. In ELISPOT assays, increased number of IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T lymphocytes from patients, but not from healthy controls, were measured upon stimulation with HR-gp100-loaded DC. HR-gp100 could represent a useful tool to load DC with multiple immunogenic epitopes/antigen-derived epitopes for the immunotherapy of melanoma.",

Recently, several signaling pathways have been shown to contribute to melanoma tumorigenesis, including constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, Akt, and Stat-3. The activation of multiple pathways may account in part for the difficulty in treatment of melanoma. In a recent screen of compounds, we found that an organopalladium compound, Tris (dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (Tris DBA), showed significant antiproliferative activity against melanoma cells. Studies were carried out to determine the mechanism of action of Tris DBA.;Tris DBA was tested on efficacy on proliferation of human and murine melanoma cells. To find the mechanism of action of Tris DBA, we did Western blot and gene array analyses. The ability of Tris DBA to block tumor growth in vivo was assessed.;Tris DBA has activity against B16 murine and A375 human melanoma in vivo. Tris DBA inhibits several signaling pathways including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, Akt, Stat-3, and S6 kinase activation, suggesting an upstream target. Tris DBA was found to be a potent inhibitor of N-myristoyltransferase-1, which is required for optimal activity of membrane-based signaling molecules. Tris DBA showed potent antitumor activity in vivo against melanoma.;Tris DBA is thus a novel inhibitor of N-myristoyltransferase-1 with significant antitumor activity and is well tolerated in vivo. Further preclinical evaluation of Tris DBA and related complexes is warranted.",

Vaccines consisting of a 1:1 mix of fusing allogeneic and autologous cells led to dramatic increases in survival of mice in both prophylactic and therapy models, dependent upon T cells, the mechanism of tumor-tumor cell fusion, and the nature of the fusion partner. Syncytia activate macrophages and fusogenic membrane glycoprotein-mediated cell killing very efficiently promotes cross-priming of immature dendritic cells with a model tumor antigen.

The specificity of the reactions was analyzed by absorption experiments using 12 melanoma sera selected for their high binding activity. Pools of human erythrocytes or leukocytes did not remove, except in 1 case respectively, the activity of the sera, suggesting that it was not directed against alloantigens. Quantitative absorption experiments were done with the 2 melanoma lines and with 1 colon carcinoma line. The results, evaluated on the basis of absorption capacity per cell, indicate that the 2 melanoma lines had a similar amount of shared antigens, whereas the colon line was also effective in absorbing out the serum activity, but less frequently and less efficiently. Further experiments performed to analyze the influence of culturing the target cells in presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), showed that the activity of sera was removed, at various degrees for different sera, by absorption with free FBS, with FBS coupled to Sepharose 4B, and with normal leukocytes cultured overnight with 10% FBS.

This action is based on the ability of HSP70 to penetrate tumor cells and extract its endogenous homolog. To enhance the efficacy of HSP70 cycling, we employed phloretin, a flavonoid that enhances the pore-forming activity of the chaperone on artificial membranes. Phloretin increased the efficacy of HSP70 penetration in B16 mouse melanoma cells and K-562 human erythroblasts; this was accompanied with increased transport of the endogenous HSP70 to the plasma membrane. Importantly, treatment with HSP70 combined with phloretin led to the elevation of cell sensitivity to cytotoxic lymphocytes by 16-18Â % compared to treatment with the chaperone alone. The incubation of K-562 cells with biotinylated HSP70 and phloretin increased the amount of the chaperone released from cells, suggesting that chaperone cycling could trigger a specific anti-tumor response. We studied the effect of the combination of HSP70 and phloretin using B16 melanoma and a novel method of HSP70-gel application. We found that the addition of phloretin to the gel reduced tumor weight almost fivefold compared with untreated mice, while the life span of the animals extended from 25 to 39Â days. The increased survival was corroborated by the activation of innate and adaptive immunity; interestingly, HSP70 was more active in induction of CD8+Â cell-mediated toxicity and Î³IFN production while phloretin contributed largely to the CD56+ cell response. In conclusion, the combination of HSP70 with phloretin could be a novel treatment for efficient immunotherapy of intractable cancers such as skin melanoma. ",

Polarized cells generate an extracellular proton gradient at their surface that increases from the rear end to the leading edge of the lamellipodium along the direction of movement. This gradient collapses upon NHE1 inhibition by HOE642. NHE1 stimulation by intracellular acidification increases the difference in pH(em) between the tips of lamellipodia and the cell body in a Na(+) dependent way.

To test the hypothesis that coexpression of vimentin and keratins by melanoma cells contributes to a more migratory and invasive phenotype, we co-transfected a vimentin-positive human melanoma cell line, A375P (of low invasive ability), with cDNAs for keratins 8 and 18. The resultant stable transfectants expressed vimentin- and keratin-positive intermediate filaments showed a two- to threefold increase in their invasion of basement membrane matrix and migration through gelatin in vitro. These findings were further corroborated by video cinematography. During attachment and spreading on fibronectin, the transfectants containing vimentin and keratins 8 and 18 demonstrated an increase in focal adhesions that stained positive for beta 1 integrin and phosphotyrosine, along with enhanced membrane ruffling and actin stress fiber formation.

Sixty percent of all lymphocytes were recovered in this monocyte-depleted lymphocyte fraction (LF). In contrast, with the corresponding unfractionated lymphocytes (UL) the LF cells were not spontaneously cytotoxic on T24 bladder carcinoma, NKI-1, NKI-7, NKI-8, NKI-10 melanoma, and MC-1 mammary carcinoma cell line cells and target cells derived from two short-term melanona cultures (Me 215 and Me 223). SC of the LF could be restored by reconstitution with autologous monocytes, which were obtained > 80% pure in the same velocity sedimentation procedure. Addition of 4-8% monocytes was sufficient to restore the SC of the LF to the level achieved with the corresponding UL, whereas maximal induction of SC was observed after addition of 8-16% monocytes. Higher numbers of monocytes had suboptimal effects. SC of the LF could also be restored by monocyte culture supernatants. The spontaneous cytotoxic effector cells were characterized as non-E rosette-forming, membrane sIg-negative Fc-receptor-bearing lymphocytes, a proportion of which probably also bear C3-receptors. Since the LF was not spontaneously cytotoxic, in spite of the presence of Fc-receptor bearing lymphocytes, it is concluded that monocyte help, mediated via soluble factors, is required. Evidence is presented that the lack of SC by the LF might be attributable to the failure of these cells to make appropriate contact with the target cells. LF/target cell contact followed by target cell kill occurred after addition of monocytes. Effector/target cell contacts, artificially established by agglutinins, did not result in target cell kill. Thus the effector/target cell contacts observed in the presence of monocytes suggest recognition of particular membraner determinants involved in SC. An identical requirement for monocytes was observed with LF cells from 5 stage 1 and 5 stage 11 melanoma patients tested for SC against both melanoma and non-melanoma target cells. This indicates that either the cytotoxicity against melanoma cells with lymphocytes from melanoma patients is of the same nature as the SC of lymphocytes from healthy donors, or that specific melanoma-associated cellular cytotoxicioty also requires monocyte help.",

The levels of spermidine-derived protein cross-links were found to be inversely related with the metastatic potential of the 2 melanoma lines. Characterization of TGase activity in the 2 tumor cell lines showed 3 types of enzyme. The soluble cellular TGase activity (TGase C) was higher, and increased more, during the growth of the least metastasizing clone B16-F10Lr6 than in the B16-F10 line, which is the most metastasizing. Consistently, N1,N8-bis(gamma-glutamyl) spermidine, which is responsible for protein cross-link formation, was present in greater amount in B16-F10Lr6 cells. The enhancement by theophylline of soluble-TGase activity and spermidine-dependent protein cross-links of B16-F10 cells reduced, with linear dose dependence, the ability of these cells to penetrate through human fibronectin-coated membrane in an in vitro assay of invasiveness.

One delivery enhancement method which has been evaluated is in vivo electroporation (EP), a contact-dependent delivery technique where electric pulses are hypothesized to augment the transfer of DNA into cells and tissues through the induction of temporary cell membrane pores. Previous work by members of our group, as well as others, has demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of DNA plasmids expressing the cytokines IL-12 and IL-15. In this report the potential anti-tumor activity of a relatively newly-described cytokine, IL-28, was measured when administered intratumorally as a DNA expression plasmid (designated pIL28) to established murine (B16.F10) melanoma tumors. The administration of the IL-28 expressing plasmid was performed through enhanced delivery methods. One method was EP and the other a non-contact dependent technique using a helium plasma stream. IL-28 is a member of the type III interferon family of cytokines that has been characterized as possessing potent anti-viral activity. This cytokine has been demonstrated to function as an adjuvant in small animal model vaccination protocols and stimulates CD8+ CTL responses. In addition, stimulation of anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated in several studies using IL-28. Based on these activities, it was hypothesized that this cytokine could, when delivered through a DNA expression plasmid, mediate anti-tumor activity. The results of this study indicated that enhanced delivery of pIL-28 resulted in attenuation of tumor growth, compared with non-enhanced delivery. Of note, this is the first proof-of-concept experiment, of our knowledge, documenting the ability of a non-contact dependent helium plasma-based delivery method to mediate the enhancement of an anti-tumor effect by a cytokine-expressing DNA plasmid. This suggests the use of the helium plasma delivery method as an alternative or adjunctive method to EP for the effective delivery of agents that possess potential anti-tumor activity.",

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of heat killed saprophytic bacterium Mycobacterium indicus pranii (Mw) on B16F10 melanoma cell invasion. Mw reported to be an immunomodulator has antitumor activity however, its effect on cancer cell invasion has not been studied. Highly invasive B16F10 melanoma was found sensitive to Mw which downregulated MMP-9 expression. Mw treatment inhibited nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional activity and respective DNA binding to MMP-9 promoter. Moreover, Mw also overcame the promoting effects of PMA on B16F10 cell invasion. Mw decreased PMA-induced transcriptional activation of NF-ÎºB and AP-1 by inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT and ERK-1/2. Furthermore, Mw strongly suppressed PMA-induced membrane localization of protein kinase C Î± (PKCÎ±) since PKCÎ± inhibition caused a marked decrease in PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion as well as AKT/ERK-1/2 activation. These results suggest that Mw may be a promising anti-invasive agent as it blocks tumor growth and inhibits B16F10 cell invasion by reducing MMP-9 activation through inhibition of PKCÎ±/ AKT/ ERK-1/2 phosphorylation and NF-ÎºB/AP-1 activation.",

A 58-year-old woman presented with a three-month history of dysphagia, retrosternal pain and weight loss. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 3 cm, non pigmented, polypoid mass of the middle esophagus and biopsy was consistent with undifferentiated carcinoma. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a 0.5 cm, polypoid lesion of the right aspect of the epiglottis consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma. The esophageal neoplasm was treated by subtotal esophagectomy while the squamous cell carcinoma of the epiglottis was referred to radiotherapy 1 month after surgery. Microscopy showed diffuse proliferation of anaplastic cells with multiple mitotic figures, marked nuclei and multilobulated nucleoli. The neoplasm stained positive for HBM-45 antigen and S-100 protein. Tumor stage was pT1N0M0. Review of patient's medical history and exploration of skin and mucous membranes failed to reveal malignant lesions and definitive diagnosis was primary amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus.

In a quest for alternative therapy targets, we had previously identified Signal Sequence Receptor 2 (SSR2) as a gene with high expression in a subgroup of human primary melanomas. Now we show that SSR2 exerts a prosurvival functionality in human melanoma cells and that high expression levels of SSR2 are associated with an unfavourable disease outcome in primary melanoma patients. Consistent with SSR's role in translocation of proteins from the ribosome across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, our data supports induction of SSR2 as a part of the ER stress response. This response included SSR2 upregulation upon development of therapy resistance to BRAF inhibitors, as well as the dependency of cell survival of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells on SSR2. Complementary gain and loss of function data showed the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to ER stress as an inducer of SSR2 via transcriptional regulation through X-Box Binding Protein 1s (XBP1s) and support an ER stress-UPR-Transcription Factor XBP1s-SSR2 response axis in human melanocytic cells. Together with its dispensability for survival in normal human cells, these data propose SSR2 as a potential therapeutic target in (therapy-resistant) human melanoma. ",

Refractory melanoma cells show either an increased capability of drug inactivation, which is known to be associated with elevated intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH), or a decreased melphalan uptake. The aim of this study was to explore a biochemical and a biophysical strategy, and their combination, to overcome melphalan resistance in melanoma cells. The biochemical strategy was based on the treatment of melanoma cells with DL-buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) to deplete the GSH levels, thus reducing melphalan inactivation. In the biophysical strategy, cell membrane electroporation was used to increase melphalan uptake. The SK-MEL 28-resistant human melanoma cell line was pretreated with 50âÎ¼mol/l BSO for 24âh and then treated with increasing melphalan doses, with or without electroporation. Spectrophotometric quantification of cell viability was used to determine melphalan cytotoxicity. Intracellular total GSH was measured using a kinetic enzymatic assay. BSO induced 3.50-fold GSH depletion in untreated cells and a similar reduction was also maintained in melphalan-treated cells. BSO pretreatment produced a 2.46-fold increase in melphalan cytotoxicity. Electroporation increased melphalan cytotoxicity 1.42-fold. The combination of both BSO pretreatment with melphalan plus electroporation led to a 4.40-fold increase in melphalan cytotoxicity compared with melphalan alone. Pretreatment with BSO and cell membrane permeabilization by electroporation enhanced the cytotoxic activity of melphalan in melanoma cells. Their rational combination deserves further investigation and may improve the efficacy of locoregional chemotherapy of melanoma. ",

In this report we identified proteins bearing beta1-6 GlcNAc branched N-glycans in three human melanoma cell lines: WM35--from the primary tumour site, as well as WM239 and WM9 from different metastatic sites: the skin and the lymph node, respectively, by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on PHA-L agarose bound material, followed by immunochemical identification.

Based on our previous results that suggested mitochondrial expression of TASK-3 channels, we hypothesized that TASK-3 channels have roles in maintaining mitochondrial activity. In the present work we studied the effect of reduced TASK-3 expression on the mitochondrial function and survival of WM35 and A2058 melanoma cells. TASK-3 knockdown cells had depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential and contained a reduced amount of mitochondrial DNA. Compared to their scrambled shRNA-transfected counterparts, they demonstrated diminished responsiveness to the application of the mitochondrial uncoupler [(3-chlorophenyl)hydrazono]malononitrile (CCCP). These observations indicate impaired mitochondrial function. Further, TASK-3 knockdown cells presented reduced viability, decreased total DNA content, altered cell morphology, and reduced surface area. In contrast to non- and scrambled shRNA-transfected melanoma cell lines, which did not present noteworthy apoptotic activity, almost 50Â % of the TASK-3 knockdown cells exhibited strong Annexin-V-specific immunofluorescence signal. Sequestration of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, increased caspase 3 activity, and translocation of the apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to cell nuclei were also demonstrated in TASK-3 knockdown cells. Interference with TASK-3 channel expression, therefore, induces caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis of melanoma cells, most likely via causing mitochondrial depolarization. Consequently, TASK-3 channels may be legitimate targets of future melanoma therapies. ",

Metastases-derived human melanoma MIM cells have an invasive ability in vitro which is dependent on metalloproteinases. In the present study we analysed the role of type I collagenase (MMP-1) in melanoma invasion using MIM cells in which the constitutive expression of MMP-1 was suppressed by stable transfection with a plasmid vector expressing a 777 bp antisense fragment of MMP-1 genomic DNA. Two clones were isolated in which MMP-1 mRNA expression was blocked by 90-96% with a corresponding loss in protein synthesis. In their morphological appearance and growth rate in vitro these cells were indistinguishable from wild type cells or control cells transfected with the same vector expressing the MMP-1 fragment in the sense orientation. Their mRNA and protein levels for type IV collagenase (MMP-2) were unchanged as assessed by Northern and Western blot analyses and by gelatin zymography. However, when the invasive ability of the cells was measured, we found that in addition to type I collagen, invasion through type IV collagen and a reconstituted, type IV collagen-containing basement membrane (Matrigel) were also significantly inhibited as compared to normal or sense-transfected cells.

In recent years, it has become evident that LHRH might act as a growth modulatory factor in tumors of the reproductive system. We have shown that in prostate cancer cells LHRH is expressed, together with its receptors, to negatively regulate cell proliferation. In these cells, LHRH acts as an antimitogenic factor through the activation of the Gi-cAMP intracellular signaling pathway. More recently, we investigated whether an LHRH-based autocrine system might also be expressed in tumors that are not classically related to the reproductive tract, such as melanoma. Malignant melanoma is known to be characterized not only by a high proliferation rate, but also by an aggressive metastatic behavior. We have demonstrated that both LHRH and LHRH receptors are expressed in human melanoma cells (BLM and Me15392). Activation of LHRH receptors by means of a potent LHRH agonist (Zoladex) significantly inhibited cell proliferation. The LHRH agonist also reduced the ability of melanoma cells to invade a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) and to migrate in response to a chemotactic stimulus. These data indicate that: (a) in prostate cancer cells the LHRH receptor is coupled to a Gi-cAMP signal transduction pathway; (b) LHRH and LHRH receptors are also expressed in tumors that are not classically related to the reproductive system, such as melanoma; in melanoma cells, LHRH might act as an inhibitory factor on both cell proliferation and metastatic behavior.

For the tolerization step, pre-immunization of Balb/c mice with a membrane-rich preparation of glioblastoma U87 cells was used. The subsequent immunizations with SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells elicited antibodies strongly reacting with 50 and 55 kDa proteins, identified as WT1. Remarkably, this was the only component strongly reactive with these antibodies in a melanoma cell lysate. WT1 was then chosen as a target for selecting internally bioactive peptides. A hydrophilic Trojan peptide containing most of the zinc finger-2 domain of WT1 was synthesized and shown to inhibit SK-MEL-28 melanoma growth in vitro. The peptide WT1-pTj was also protective in vivo in a metastatic melanoma model and peptide-stimulated syngeneic dendritic cells reproduced the anti-melanoma effect of the unprotected peptide.

Lysosomal content was released into the culture medium directly after irradiation and such conditioned media stimulated the growth of non-irradiated cell cultures. By comparing melanocytes and melanoma cells, it was found that only the melanoma cells spontaneously secreted cathepsins into the surrounding medium. Melanoma cells from a primary tumour showed pronounced invasion ability, which was prevented by addition of inhibitors of cathepsins B, D and L. Proliferation was reduced by cathepsin L inhibition in all melanoma cell lines, but did not affect melano-cyte growth.

Orbital exenteration including superior and inferior palpebrae was performed, and the removed tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy. In the temporal bulbar conjunctiva, melanocytes containing abundant fine melanin granules proliferated over almost the whole area of the epithelial layer. Cellular atypia and karyomitosis were not observed. The basement membrane remained intact with no proliferation of melanocytes in the substantia propria. However, in the perivascular area, in addition to the moderately prominent infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells, infiltration by melanophages was observed relatively frequently. Based on these findings, it was confirmed that the primary lesion of the bulbar conjunctiva was an acquired melanosis of Stage IB as classified by Zimmerman. The black nodular tumors of the superior palpebral conjunctiva and inferior palpebral skin consisted of melanoma cells showing markedly prominent cellular and nuclear atypia. The nuclei showed indentations in the membrane with electron-lucent karyoplasm, each having one nucleolus. The cytoplasm contained many round or elongated melanosomes in various developmental stages, with sizes of about 0.7 micron. Scattered among melanoma cells were a number of melanophages which had phagocytized many melanosomes at various stages of maturity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

An indole carboxylate-PBD hybrid with six-carbon spacer structure (IN6CPBD) has been previously demonstrated to induce melanoma cell apoptosis and reduce metastasis in mouse lungs. This study aimed at investigating the efficacy of the other hybrid compound with four-carbon spacer (IN4CPBD) and elucidating its anti-metastatic mechanism. Human melanoma A375 cells with IN4CPBD treatment underwent cytotoxicity and apoptosis-associated assays. Transwell migration assay, Western blotting, and ELISA were used for mechanistic study. IN4CPBD exhibited potent melanoma cytotoxicity through interrupting G1/S cell cycle progression, increasing DNA fragmentation and hypodipoidic DNA contents, and reducing mitochondrial membrane potential. Caspase activity elevation suggested that both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways were involved in IN4CPBD-induced melanoma apoptosis. IN4CPBD up-regulated p53 and p21, thereby concomitantly derailing the equilibrium between Bcl-2 and Bax levels. Transwell migration assay demonstrated that stromal cell-derived factor-1Î± (SDF-1Î±) stimulated A375 cell motility, while kinase inhibitors treatment confirmed that Rho/ROCK, Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK pathways were involved in SDF-1Î±-enhanced melanoma migration. IN4CPBD not only abolished the SDF-1Î±-enhanced chemotactic motility but also suppressed constitutive MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Mechanistically, IN4CPBD down-regulated Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK total proteins and MYPT1 phosphorylation. In conclusion, beyond the fact that IN4CPBD induces melanoma cell apoptosis at cytotoxic dose, the interruption in the VEGF expression and the SDF-1Î±-related signaling at cytostatic dose may partially constitute the rationale for its in vivo anti-metastatic potency.",

We used 3 human melanoma cell lines (GLL-19, Mel Juso and G361) which lack receptors to alpha-MSH and express CALLA, and, as a control, one CALLA-negative melanoma cell line (HBL) with specific receptors for alpha-MSH. Radioimmunoassays give evidence that alpha-MSH was degraded in the presence of the 4 melanoma cell lines and that disappearance of the peptide was significantly reduced by phosphoramidon in 2 lines (GLL-19 and G361). Upon incubation of alpha-MSH with GLL-19 and G361 cell membranes, 3 degradation products were completely abolished in the presence of phosphoramidon. Amino acid content analysis of alpha-MSH fragments produced by purified E-24.11 permitted identification of 6 peptide bonds in the sequence of alpha-MSH susceptible to cleavage by the enzyme. It is concluded that alpha-MSH is a substrate in vitro for purified E-24.11 and for the enzyme present on the human melanoma cell lines GLL-19 and G361, expressing a high level of endopeptidase activity.

Although RA failed to exhibit direct toxicity on this variant at the concentration used, the immunologic aberrations induced by the tumors were diminished by i.p. RA administration (at 45 micrograms twice/week for 3 weeks). In mice bearing B16-F10 tumors, tumor burdens were decreased from 2.9% of body weight to 1.6%.

The presence of these tumor cells decreased the absolute number of CD4- and CD8-positive splenic lymphocytes. Following RA treatment, the CD8-positive population was increased in tumor-bearing mice, while the CD4+ population was not significantly altered. Since previous studies indicated that plasma membrane fragments (or vesicles) could alter lymphocyte distributions and proliferative capacities, the in vitro shedding of membrane fragments from B16-F10 tumor cells was assayed and observed to be decreased after continuous treatment of cultures with 10(-6) M RA for 21 days.

Until recently, treatment options for patients with stages III-IV metastatic disease were limited and offered marginal, if any, improvement in overall survival. The situation changed with the introduction of B-RAF inhibitors and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 immunotherapies into the clinical practice. With only some patients responding well to the immune therapies and with very serious side effects and high costs of immunotherapy, there is still room for other approaches for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Targeted radionuclide therapy of melanoma could be divided into the domains of radioimmunotherapy (RIT), radiolabeled peptides, and radiolabeled small molecules. RIT of melanoma is currently experiencing a renaissance with the clinical trials of alpha-emitter (213)Bi-labeled and beta-emitter (188)Rhenium-labeled monoclonal antibodies in patients with metastatic melanoma producing encouraging results. The investigation of the mechanism of efficacy of melanoma RIT points at killing of melanoma stem cells by RIT and involvement of immune system such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The domain of radiolabeled peptides for targeted melanoma therapy has been preclinical so far, with work concentrated on radiolabeled peptide analogues of melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor and on melanin-binding peptides. The field of radiolabeled small molecule produced radioiodinated benzamides that cross the cellular membrane and bind to the intracellular melanin. The recent clinical trial demonstrated measurable antitumor effects and no acute or midterm toxicities. We are hopeful that the targeted radionuclide therapy of metastatic melanoma would become a clinical reality as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with the immunotherapies such as anti-PD1 programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibodies within the next few years.

Treatment of M2R cells with PMA resulted in a significant loss of beta-MSH binding. The effect was both time- and concentration-dependent. The inhibition of beta-MSH binding resulted from a decrease (greater than 85%) in active membranal receptors available on the external cell surface and not from either enhanced internalization or change in the binding affinity. Agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation was profoundly increased in a non-selective manner following short-term incubation (3 h) with PMA. This effect was completely reversed during long-term (72-96 h) incubation with the tumor promoting agent. Long-term culturing of M2R cells with PMA resulted in enhanced (+50%) proliferation of the melanoma cells. This enhancement was blocked by the addition of agents which stimulate the production of cAMP. Hence, phorbol esters are powerful growth promoters in transformed melanocytes and our findings indicate that the effects of melanotropins are selectively impaired during the process of growth promotion.",

Membrane fractions prepared by differential centrifugation of sonicated B-16 melanoma cells were shown here to contain a collagenase stimulatory factor(s) (CSF). Trypsin treatment of intact B-16 cells prior to membrane fractionation led to loss of 90% of the total activity, indicating that CSF is localized on the outer surface of the cells. Stimulation of fibroblast collagenase production was also observed with dialyzed octylglucoside extracts of the B-16 membranes. Additional of exogenous lipid, ie, a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, to the detergent extract of the membranes followed by dialysis and centrifugation at 100,000g resulted in 80% recovery of the factor activity in the pellet containing reconstituted lipid vesicles. Fractionation of tritium-labeled, reconstituted lipid vesicles on a Sephacryl S-300 column revealed that the collagenase stimulatory factor coeluted with the radioactive lipid vesicles. The fractionated lipid vesicles lost stimulatory activity completely after trypsin treatment or heating at 65 degrees C, indicating that the factor is a protein.",

The aim of the present study was to check and estimate spontaneous apoptosis of cells from cell cycle phases. Cytometric cell cycle analysis was performed by staining cells with propidium iodide (PI). Apoptosis estimated by the TUNEL method, alterations in the plasma membrane structure (annexin V staining), changes in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential--delta psi m (JC-1 staining) showed that amelanotic melanoma cells have decreased ability to undergo spontaneous apoptosis. The obtained results showing that in the native melanotic line about 30% of cells are in S+G2/M phases and that 33% of these cells undergo apoptosis could lead to the conclusion that the slower growth of this melanoma line is the result of lower proliferation activity and higher rate of apoptosis of these tumor cells. The number of cells in S+G2/M phases in amelanotic melanoma line increases up to 40% and only 7% of them undergo apoptosis. This observation seems to suggest that the expansive growth of this melanoma line depends mainly on the decreased ability to undergo spontaneous apoptosis, especially in case of cells from S+G2/M phases. Moreover, the obtained results indicate that alteration of melanotic line into amelanotic one, accompanied by differences in many biological features also concerns basic cell processes such as cell cycle and cell death.",

These have been classified according to the extent of their expression on cells of other tissues, but it is evident that a more precise classification based on their biochemical nature is possible. Several monoclonal antibodies appear to define antigens restricted to melanoma cells and fetal tissues. Many antibodies recognize antigens shared with gliomas and nevi, whereas other groups can be defined which recognize antigens on melanocytes or other carcinomas. One of the commonly detected antigens was shown to be a high molecular weight (MW) proteoglycan which may be involved in reactions with other cells and the intercellular matrix. A second antigen was shown to be a ganglioside which may have receptor functions in cells. A third was shown to be a glycoprotein with iron transport functions. The latter antigen and the large MW proteoglycan have been a focus of attention for in vivo targeting studies in treatment and diagnosis. The ganglioside, large MW proteoglycan and a melanocarcinoma antigen may be detected in the circulation of patients and are being evaluated for monitoring of disease activity in patients with melanoma. Several monoclonals may be of value in histological evaluation of melanoma, e.g. diagnosis of preneoplastic lesions, metastatic lesions of unknown origin and identification of cell structures related to metastatic behaviour in the host.

Whereas p57 was purified from human erythrocytes, p65 was identified using polyclonal anti-p57 antibodies on a human melanoma cell line resistant to complement lysis. Analysis of cell distribution of C3-cleaving proteinases established that DSm, a murine melanoma cell line, expressed a C3-cleaving proteinase distinct from p57 and p65 proteinases. Thus we purified the C3-cleaving proteinase solubilized from membranes of DSm cells. The purified proteinase, termed 'p39' on the basis of its molecular mass of 39 kDa, was identified, using specific proteinase inhibitors, as a cysteine proteinase. Anti-p39 antibodies, prepared against highly purified p39, localized the p39 C3-cleaving proteinase mainly at the cell surface and demonstrated that p39 is also secreted. Anti-p39 antibodies inhibited solubilized C3-cleaving activity. Preincubation of DSm cells with anti-p39 F(ab')2 fragments increased up to 60% complement cell susceptibility. Amino acid analysis of N-terminal and three other regions of p39 demonstrated that this C3-cleaving proteinase carries 100% identity within four regions of procathepsin L. This is the first demonstration that a melanoma cell line expresses on its surface and secretes a p39 C3-cleaving cysteine proteinase that shares sequence identities with procathepsin L.

The activation of pro-MMP-2 correlates with increased occurrence of metastases. Increased MMP-2 activity has been demonstrated in many human tumors. In the present communication, we studied cell surface-associated activation of MMP-2 (72 kDa collagenase type IV) in the moderately metastatic human melanoma cell line A375.;Activation of purified 72 kDa collagenase type IV, pro-MMP-2 from cervical cancer tissue homogenate and from serum-free culture medium of HT1080 cells grown in presence of concanavalin A, by A375 cells, was shown by gelatin zymography. A375 cells activated only pro-MMP-2 from purified MMP-9/MMP-2 mixture indicating that the activation is specific for MMP-2. Activation of MMP-2 and purified collagenase type IV by A375 membrane fraction and membrane extract was also demonstrated by gelatin zymography. When A375 cells were first incubated with anti-MT1-MMP polyclonal antibody, activation of collagenase type IV was significantly decreased, indicating that membrane-associated MMP-2 activation is MT1-MMP-mediated. Immunocytochemistry showed MT1-MMP localization at focal adhesion sites. The presence of the components of activation complex-MT1-MMP and integrin alphavbeta3-were confirmed by Western blot, cell adhesion assay, and integrin subunit assay.;Our experimental findings furnish another example of the unique membrane-associated MMP-2 activation mechanism in A375 melanoma cells and clearly indicate the role of MT1-MMP in MMP-2 activation.

In vitro studies of melanoma cell lines have shown invasion suppressor and promoter roles for E-cadherin and N-cadherin, respectively. In the present study, we investigated the effect of P-cadherin on aggregation and invasion using melanoma cells retrovirally transduced with human P-cadherin. De novo expression of P-cadherin in P-cadherin-negative cell lines (BLM and HMB2) promoted cell-cell contacts and Ca2+-dependent cell-cell aggregation in two- and three-dimensional cultures, whereas it counteracted invasion. These effects were not observed following P-cadherin transduction of endogenously P-cadherin-positive MeWo cells. In addition, P-cadherin-transduced BLM cells coaggregated with keratinocytes and showed markedly reduced invasion in a reconstructed skin model. The proadhesive and anti-invasive effects of P-cadherin were abolished on targeted mutation of its intracellular juxtamembrane domain or its extracellular domain. For the latter mutation, we mimicked a known missense mutation in P-cadherin (R503H), which is associated with congenital hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Surface galactosyltransferase (GT) has been described on a variety of cells where it is believed to be involved in cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion. Here we show that B16 metastatic murine melanoma cells exhibit a 5-fold higher cell surface GT activity than their nonmetastatic counterparts, although total GT activity in NP-40 solubilized cells is similar for both melanoma variants. Interestingly, on living cells, this cell surface GT almost exclusively galactosylates an endogenous glycoprotein (Mr = 110,000). This metastasis-associated GT is specific for terminal D-N-acetylglucosamine, catalyzes the formation of a beta 1-4 linkage, does not recognize polylactosaminoglycans, and has its specificity altered from D-N-acetylglucosamine to D-glucose by alpha-lactalbumin; yet the Mr = 110,000 protein is not a major substrate when exogenous bovine GT is used on the outside of living cells. In addition to this protein-specific endogenous GT activity, another cell surface GT activity that selectively galactosylates glucosylceramide is also prominent. Endogenous galactosylation of both protein and glycolipid substrates is reduced when the membrane is solubilized by the detergent NP-40 but remains unaltered in the presence of digitonin, which permeabilizes but does not dissolve the membrane. These data suggest that the GTs and their substrates are associated on the cell surface. Chloroquine treatment of intact cells leads to a 4-fold and a 3-fold increase in galactosylation of the Mr = 110,000 protein and glucosylceramide, respectively, suggesting that these two substrates normally reside mostly in the lysosomal or Golgi compartments. The increased expression of lysosomal membrane proteins on the surfaces of highly metastatic cells may, in part, also explain the galactosylation differences observed. These studies further suggest that increased surface localization of certain glycosyltransferases with highly restricted in situ substrate specificities may be a common feature of highly metastatic tumor cells.",

The associated mechanisms were also investigated. We demonstrated that ABT-737 significantly sensitized curcumin-induced activity against melanoma cells (WM-115 and B16 lines), resulting in substantial cell death and apoptosis with co-administration. At the molecular level, curcumin and ABT-737 synergistically induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening in melanoma cells, the latter was evidenced by mitochondrial membrane potential (MPP) reduction and mitochondrial complexation between cyclophilin-D (CyPD) and adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT-1). Significantly, mPTP blockers, including cyclosporin A and sanglifehrin A, remarkably inhibited curcumin and ABT-737 co-administration-induced cytotoxicity against melanoma cells. Meanwhile, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CyPD or ANT-1, the two key components of mPTP, alleviated WM-116 cell death by the co-treatment. Collectively, we show that ABT-737 sensitizes curcumin-induced anti-melanoma cell activity probably through facilitating mPTP death pathway.

Significant levels of GGT activity are expressed by malignant tumours, and in melanoma cell lines they were found to correlate with the malignant behaviour. As hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants can affect signal transduction pathways at several levels, the present study was aimed to verify: (i) the occurrence of GGT-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide in melanoma cells; (ii) the effects of GGT-dependent prooxidant reactions on known redox-sensitive cellular targets, i.e. protein thiols, the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B and p53. Two melanoma Me665/2 cell clones, exhibiting traces of (clone 2/21) or high (clone 2/60) GGT activity, were studied. The occurrence of GGT-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide was apparent in 2/60 cells, in which it was accompanied by lower levels of cell surface protein thiols. In 2/60 cells, GGT expression was also associated with higher levels of NF-kappa B activation, as compared to GGT-poor 2/21 cell clone. Indeed, stimulation or inhibition of GGT activity in 2/60 cells resulted in progressive activation or inactivation of NF-kappa B, respectively. An analysis of the p53 gene product indicated lack of protein expression in 2/60 cells, whereas a mutant protein was highly expressed in 2/21 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of GGT activity can provide melanoma cells with an additional source of hydrogen peroxide, and that such prooxidant reactions are capable to modify protein thiols at the cell surface level. In addition, GGT expression results in an up-regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, which could explain the higher metastatic behaviour reported for GGT-rich melanoma cells as compared to their GGT-poor counterparts.",

The patients developed high levels of cytotoxic (CTX) and complement-fixing (CF) antibodies to the UCLA-SO-M14 (M14) cells, one of the three melanoma cell lines in the MCV. Significant rises in CTX and CF antibodies occurred one month post-immunotherapy. While the level of CTX antibodies was maintained for 11 months thereafter, the titer of CF antibodies was sustained for seven months, then gradually declined. When the sera were absorbed with lymphoblastoid (ML14) cells which are autologous to the M14 cells, two residual peaks of CTX antibodies, one and four months postimmunotherapy and two peaks of CF antibodies, one and seven months postimmunotherapy, emerged. Two sera that exhibited high levels of CTX and CF antibodies one month postimmunotherapy were absorbed with ML14 cells and human fetal brain tissue. The reactivity of one serum in both the CDAC and MCF assays were abolished, whereas the reactivity of the other serum was not significantly diminished in either assay. These data indicate that the stage II post-surgical melanoma patients developed a humoral immune response to at least two distinct tumor antigens on the membrane of the M14 cells.

Fibroblasts showed a rapid drop in thymidine pool size and decreased incorporation of thymidine and uridine when treated with EGTA, followed during the next 48 hr by a decrease in plasma membrane potential and by development of a proliferative block in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The calcium-independent melanoma line MM96 exhibited an early decrease in thymidine pool size and enhanced incorporation of nucleosides but continued to proliferate with little perturbation of the cell cycle or change in membrane potential. Tumor cell DNA may therefore be selectively labeled in the presence of normal cells. The anomalous, calcium-dependent melanoma line (MM170) showed an immediate increase in the thymidine pool size and in nucleoside incorporation and subsequently accumulated in G1 and G2 with diminution of membrane potential and of DNA and RNA synthesis. The proliferative block in MM170 cells could be reversed by addition of calcium ion or by replacement with control medium. Addition to the medium of all 8 nucleosides (50 microM), singly or together, did not prevent EGTA-induced cytostasis in fibroblasts or MM170; transport of thymidine across the cell membrane was enhanced by 24-hr EGTA treatment in fibroblasts, MM96, and MM170. Thus, although calcium affected thymidine utilization rapidly and differently in each of the three cell types, nucleoside starvation per se did not appear to be responsible for either type of proliferative block.",

Here we provide evidence that the arrest of intravascular B16F1 melanoma cells in the liver induces a rapid local release of nitric oxide (NO) that causes apoptosis of the melanoma cells and inhibits their subsequent development into hepatic metastases. B16F1 melanoma cells (5 x 10(5)) labeled with fluorescent microspheres were injected into the portal circulation of C57BL/6 mice. The production of NO in vivo was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy ex vivo using an exogenous NO-trapping agent. A burst of NO was observed in liver samples examined immediately after tumor cell injection. The relative electron paramagnetic resonance signal intensity was 667 +/- 143 units in mice injected with tumor cells versus 28 +/- 5 units after saline injection (P < 0.001). Two-thirds of cells arrested in the sinusoids compared with the terminal portal venules (TPVs). By double labeling of B16F1 cells with fluorescent microspheres and a TdT-mediated UTP end labeling assay, we determined that the melanoma cells underwent apoptosis from 4-24 h after arrest. The mean rate of apoptosis was 2-fold greater in the sinusoids than in the TPVs at 4, 8, and 24 h after injection (P < 0.05-0.01). Apoptotic cells accounted for 15.9 +/- 0.8% of tumor cells located in the sinusoids and 7.1 +/- 0.9% of tumor cells in the TPVs. The NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester completely blocked the NO burst (P < 0.001) and inhibited the apoptosis of B16F1 cells in the sinusoids by 77%. However, the rate of tumor cell apoptosis in the TPVs was not changed. There were 5-fold more metastatic nodules in the livers of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester-treated mice (P < 0.05). The inactive enantiomer N(G)-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester had no effect on the initial NO burst or on apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. Both annexin V phosphatidylserine plasma membrane labeling and DNA end labeling of apoptotic cells were demonstrated after a 5-min exposure (a time equivalent to the initial transient NO induction in vivo) of B16F1 cells to a NO donor in vitro. These results identify the existence of a natural defense mechanism against cancer metastasis whereby the arrest of tumor cells in the liver induces endogenous NO release, leading to sinusoidal tumor cell killing and reduced hepatic metastasis formation.",

We have recently identified melanin as a target for radionuclide therapy of melanoma and demonstrated the feasibility of this approach using a 188-rhenium ( (188)Re)-radiolabeled melanin-binding decapeptide to fungal melanin known as 4B4. Although the results indicated that radiolabeled melanin-binding decapeptide had activity against melanoma, that peptide also manifested high kidney uptake and this might become a concern during clinical trials. We hypothesized that by identifying peptides with different amino acid composition against tumor melanin we might be able to decrease their kidney uptake. Using the Heptapeptide Ph.D.-7 Phage Display Library, we identified three heptapeptides that bind to human tumor melanin. These peptides were radiolabeled with (188)Re via HYNIC ligand, and their comprehensive biodistribution in A2058 human metastatic melanoma tumor-bearing nude mice was compared to that of (188)Re-4B4 decapeptide. While tumor uptake of heptapeptides was quite similar to that of (188)Re-4B4 decapeptide, there was dramatically less uptake in the kidneys at both 3 h (6% ID/g vs 38%) and 24 h (2% ID/g vs 15%) postinjection. Administration of one of the generated heptapeptides, (188)Re-HYNIC-AsnProAsnTrpGlyProArg, to A2058 human metastatic melanoma-bearing nude mice resulted in significant retardation of the tumor growth. Immunofluorescence showed that in spite of their relatively small size heptapeptides were not able to penetrate through the membranes of viable melanoma cells and bound only to extracellular melanin, which provides assurance that they will be safe to healthy melanin-containing tissues during radionuclide therapy. Thus, these heptapeptides appear to have potentially significant advantages for targeted therapy of melanoma relative to existing melanin-binding peptides.",

Immunohistochemical studies were done to localize the LAK cells as well as electron microscopical observations for effector/target membrane contacts. Proliferation of the nodules was tested and also that of the LAK cells after coculturing using tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA. Cell death was determined by arrest of thymidine incorporation and total nodule disintegration. Infiltration rate of LAK cells into the nodules was low: after coculturing 5% of the nodule cells were LAK cells. Although close membrane contacts and cytoplasmic fusions between effector and target cells leading to tumor cell apoptosis were observed, this direct cytolytic process seemed to be too infrequent for the induction of total nodule disintegration at day 6. Therefore, the indirect pathway to cytolysis might be predominant implying, among other cytokines, soluble TNF. On the other hand, LAK cell proliferation diminished strongly after coculturing (down to 11%) but the cytotoxicity was significantly enhanced (18% higher) suggesting an enhancement of differentiation.

The extent of peak-splittings due to 2H-quadrupole interaction decreased as the temperature rose, and a definite point of phase transition was not observed. At elevated temperature, 2H-labeled lipids undergo fast exchange between the bilayer and an isotropic phase such as oil phase of triolein or inverted micelles in lipid polymorphs. We further analyzed the change of membrane organization in mouse B16 melanoma cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which strongly inhibited melanogenesis. The magnitude of the quadrupole splitting at 19 degrees C in membranes from TPA-treated cells was significantly less (40%) than in the untreated control. This is mainly explained by decreased molecular ordering (fluidity) due to the increased amount of unsaturated fatty acids in the membranes of TPA-treated cells.",

However, podoplanin expression in metastatic GCTs and other metastatic tumors has not been extensively examined. The goal of this study was to evaluate the distribution and specificity of podoplanin using monoclonal antibody D2-40 in primary testicular and metastatic GCTs in comparison with other metastatic neoplasms. In total, 122 tumors were studied: 43 primary GCTs, 33 metastatic GCTs, 11 metastatic melanomas, 25 metastatic carcinomas, and 10 lymphomas. All foci of seminoma showed strong, diffuse membranous staining in more than 90% of cells in primary and metastatic GCTs. In contrast, other GCT components showed only focal cytoplasmic and/or partial membranous staining in a subset of cases. Among non-GCTs, only 1 metastatic melanoma, 1 lymphoma, and 3 metastatic carcinomas showed focal, weak cytoplasmic staining. Diffuse membranous immunoreactivity for podoplanin as detected by monoclonal antibody D2-40 is highly sensitive and specific for primary and metastatic seminoma.

Causes of secondary MG (15Â % of cases), namely solid or haematological cancers, are common, with parallel development between the two diseases suggesting paraneoplastic syndrome.

We report a case of a patient with stage III melanoma presenting MG developing in parallel to the melanoma.;A 61-year-old man was referred for melanoma on the right side with a Breslow index of 3mm, and without ulceration. While the patient had no adenopathy, he was presenting severe hypertension diagnosed two months earlier as well as diffuse pitting oedema, with weight gain of 15kg in one month. Additional treatment of the patient's melanoma included extended excision, examination of the two right axillary sentinel nodes (positive), and axillary lymph node dissection revealing four more metastatic nodes. A thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CAT scan showed no further metastasis. Investigation of the oedema revealed nephrotic syndrome with hypoalbuminaemia of 14g/L and proteinuria of 5g/24h. Renal biopsy resulted in the diagnosis of MG. Histological and immunohistochemical examination (HMB-45, Melan A, S100 protein) showed no tumour cells in the kidney, and urinary cytology was negative. Non-tumoral causes of MG were thus ruled out. The oedema regressed rapidly following surgical treatment of the melanoma, with no specific renal or oncological treatment being given. Two years after axillary lymph node dissection, the patient was in complete remission of his melanoma and renal tests showed spontaneous regression of nephrotic syndrome, with disappearance of the oedema, normalisation of blood pressure and gradual correction of serum albumin (40g/L) and proteinuria (1g/24h).;Paraneoplastic MG has been described particularly in patients with gastrointestinal and pulmonary cancer.

J. Cancer Res., 75:418-426, 1984). The structure defined by this antibody was identified as GM3 (Hirabayashi, Y., et al., J. Biol.

Since GM3 lactone was found to be highly immunogenic, we subsequently immunized C57BL/6 mice with GM3 lactone coated on Salmonella minnesotae and established hybridoma DH2, secreting an IgG3 antibody showing preferential reactivity with GM3 lactone over GM3 under certain conditions. The reactivity of the DH2 antibody was competitively inhibited by M2590, and it showed a preferential reactivity with melanoma cells and displayed various immunochemical and immunobiological properties similar to those of M2590. However, DH2 antibody inhibited melanoma cell growth in vivo, induced antibody-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro, and showed a preferential accumulation in melanoma growth in vivo. These properties are characteristic of the IgG3 subclass, in striking contrast to IgM antibody M2590, which does not inhibit cell growth in vivo or in vitro and does not induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. Thus, immunization with lactone forms of tumor-associated ganglioside antigens might be useful in the production of antibodies and prevention of tumor cell growth in vivo (antitumor vaccines).",

Here, we investigated the influence of spermidine (SPD) incorporation by TG into basement membrane components i.e. laminin (LN) or Matrigel (MG), on the adhesion and invasion of B16-F10 melanoma cells by these TG/SPD-modified substrates. The adhesion assays showed that cell binding to the TG/SPD-modified LN was reduced by 30%, when compared to untreated LN, whereas the reduction obtained using TG/SPD-modified MG was 35%. Similarly, tumor cell invasion by the Boyden chamber system through TG/SPD modified LN or MG was respectively reduced by 45%, and by 69%. Evaluation of matrix metalloproteinase (gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9) activities by gel-zymography showed that MMP-2 activity was unaffected, while MMP-9 activity was reduced by about 32% using TG/SPD-modified substrate. These results strongly suggest that the observed antiinvasive effect of TG activation in the host may be ascribed to the covalent incorporation of polyamines, which led to the post-translational modification of some components of the cell basement membrane. This modification may interfere with the metastatic property of melanoma cells, affecting the proteolytic activity necessary for their migration and invasion activities.",

The receptor was identified as a 55,000-60,000 kDa cell surface protein. Although M24met cells secrete uPA, they are unable to efficiently utilize this enzyme for invasion, unless it is bound to its receptor. This contention is based on the finding that an antibody against uPAR (monoclonal antibody 3936) inhibited invasion of M24met cells through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) up to 33%, while a reduction of uPA catalytic activity by its plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 resulted in 46% inhibition of invasion. Furthermore, uPAR is involved in signal transduction events in M24met cells, since both uPA and its amino-terminal fragment stimulated the migration of melanoma cells toward Matrigel, resulting in maximal increases of 32 and 72%, respectively. Our results indicate that both uPA and uPAR are involved in melanoma metastasis and that uPAR contributes to at least two important steps in this process, matrix dissolution and migration.",

Mouse models have been broadly utilized to study tissue morphogenesis in vivo. However mouse and human skin have significant differences in cellular architecture and physiology, which makes it difficult to extrapolate mouse studies to humans. Since melanocytes in mouse skin are mostly localized in hair follicles, they have distinct biological properties from those of humans, which locate primarily at the basal layer of the epidermis. The recent development of 3D human skin reconstruct models has enabled the field to investigate cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions between different cell types. The reconstructs consist of a \"dermis\" with fibroblasts embedded in a collagen I matrix, an \"epidermis\", which is comprised of stratified, differentiated keratinocytes and a functional basement membrane, which separates epidermis from dermis. Collagen provides scaffolding, nutrient delivery, and potential for cell-to-cell interaction. The 3D skin models incorporating melanocytic cells recapitulate natural features of melanocyte homeostasis and melanoma progression in human skin. As in vivo, melanocytes in reconstructed skin are localized at the basement membrane interspersed with basal layer keratinocytes. Melanoma cells exhibit the same characteristics reflecting the original tumor stage (RGP, VGP and metastatic melanoma cells) in vivo. Recently, dermal stem cells have been identified in the human dermis (6). These multi-potent stem cells can migrate to the epidermis and differentiate to melanocytes.",

Increased levels of circulating glycosaminoglycans have been observed in suramin-treated cancer patients, suggesting that it may inhibit glycosaminoglycan catabolism. Melanoma-derived heparanase, a heparan sulfate-specific endo-beta-D-glucuronidase that plays an important role in metastatic melanoma cell invasion through basement membranes, is inhibited by suramin in a dose-dependent manner: 100% inhibition was observed at a concentration of approximately 100 microM. Structurally related polysulfonated compounds, such as trypan blue and Evans blue, had lower heparanase inhibitory activities: the concentrations required for 50% heparanase inhibition (ID50) were 310-320 microM and six times higher than for suramin (ID50 = 46 microM). Oversulfated heparin tetrasaccharide, whose average molecular size is similar to suramin, had also much lower heparanase inhibitory activity than suramin. The inhibition constants (Ki) for suramin and oversulfated heparin tetrasaccharide were 48 and 290 microM, respectively. Suramin had a remarkable inhibitory activity against B16 melanoma cell invasion through reconstituted basement membranes (ID50 less than 10 microM). The inhibitory effects of suramin on melanoma heparanase and cell invasion appeared to be completely independent of its antiproliferative activity, because significant effects on melanoma cell growth were not observed at the concentrations of suramin used in this study.

Biochemical and immunocytochemical evidence shows that the platelet integrin receptor alpha IIb beta 3 is present on the cell surface, at focal adhesion plaques and in the perinuclear region of metastatic B16a murine melanoma cells. Antibody to the fibronectin receptor alpha 5 beta i, inhibits basal adhesion by approx. 30%, whereas antibodies to alpha IIb beta 3 are ineffective. The surface immunoreactivity of tumor cells for alpha IIb beta 3 can be enhanced by pre-treatment (5 min) with a lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid [i.e. 12-(S)-HETE] in a dose-dependent manner (max. effect approx. 0.1 microM). Other lipoxygenase metabolites are ineffective. B16a cells possess a large intracellular pool of alpha IIb beta 3, from which the receptor complex translocates to the cell surface following 12-(S)-HETE pretreatment. This pre-treatment of tumor cells enhances their adhesion to fibronectin, which is mediated exclusively by alpha IIb beta 3 receptors. 12-(S)-HETE also facilitates the redistribution of alpha IIb beta 3 in the plasma membrane with localization at the focal adhesion plaques. The cytoskeleton of the B16a cell is characterized by an absence of distinct microtubules in interphase cells and the presence of prominent microfilaments and vimentin intermediate filaments. In B16a cells, the disruption of intermediate filaments and/or microfilaments prevents the 12-(S)-HETE-induced increase in plasma membrane alpha IIb beta 3 and enhanced tumor-cell adhesion to fibronectin. The microtubule-disrupting agent, colchicine, is ineffective in both respects. We conclude that the lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid, 12-(S)-HETE, regulates the surface expression and function of the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin in B16a cells. Further, these data support the hypothesis that microfilaments and intermediate filaments have a profound role in regulating the expression of a multifunctional integrin in B16a tumor cells.",

To determine the mechanisms of PEITC inhibition of cell growth, the following end points were determined in A375.S2 cells: cell morphological changes, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and fragmentation assays and morphological assessment of nuclear change, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) generations, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, and nitric oxide and 10-N-nonyl acridine orange productions, expression and activation of caspase-3 and -9, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax), Bcl-2, poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase, and cytochrome c release, apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G. PEITC induced morphological changes in time- and dose-dependent manner. PEITC induced G2/M phase arrest and induced apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway. Western blot analysis showed that PEITC promoted Bax expression and inhibited Bcl-2 expression associated with the disintegration of the outer mitochondrial membrane causing cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase-9 and -3 cascade leading to apoptosis. We conclude that PEITC-triggered apoptotic death in A375.S2 cells occurs through ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathways. ",

The migration of two melanoma cell lines, A375 and Mewo, was potentiated by conditioned media of A431 epidermoid cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The enhancement of A375 melanoma cell motility induced by the conditioned medium was blocked by antibodies against either alpha3 or beta1 integrin subunit. The motility-stimulating activity was recovered in the same fraction as the alpha3 integrin-dependent adhesion-promoting activity in a high-molecular-weight (>200 kDa) fraction on Superose 12 gel chromatography, and adsorbed with an anti-laminin-5 antibody. Purified laminin-5 was capable of potentiating melanoma cell migration as measured in either the chemotaxis assay with a soluble form of laminin-5 or the haptotaxis assay with membranes coated with a mixture of laminin-5 and Matrigel. Furthermore, immobilized laminin-5 induced A375 melanoma cells to secrete matrix metalloproteinase-9 (type IV collagenase) into the culture medium. These results strongly suggest that the interaction of laminin-5 produced in the epidermis with alpha3beta1 integrin on melanoma cells is involved in cell migration, invasion, and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins.",

It was found by several methodologic approaches that the 6 human melanoma cell lines varied significantly in their amount of sialic acid susceptible to Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase, but had similar amounts of total sialic acid residues. Cells in the LT group exhibited twice as much cell surface sialic acid residue susceptible to this enzyme as cells in the HT group. Specific fluorescent labeling of external cell surface sialic acid residues showed that the LT cells present a patch-like distribution of the label, whereas the HT cells are characterized by a more homogeneous distribution of the label.

Because the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) has been shown to cause extracellular acidification by pumping protons, we studied the role of V-ATPase in distant metastasis. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the high-metastatic B16-F10 melanoma cells strongly expressed the a3 isoform V-ATPase compared to the low-metastatic B16 parental cells. Consistent with this, B16-F10 cells created acidic environments in lung metastases by acridine orange staining and strong a3 V-ATPase expression in bone metastases by immunohistochemistry. Immunocytochemical analysis showed B16-F10 cells expressed a3 V-ATPase not only in cytoplasm but also plasma membrane, whereas B16 parental cells exhibited its expression only in cytoplasm. Of note, knockdown of a3 V-ATPase suppressed invasiveness and migration with reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in B16-F10 cells and significantly decreased lung and bone metastases, despite that tumor growth was not altered. Importantly, administration of a specific V-ATPase a3 inhibitor FR167356 reduced bone metastasis of B16-F10 cells. These results suggest that a3 V-ATPase promotes distant metastasis of B16-F10 cells by creating acidic environments via proton secretion. Our results also suggest that inhibition of the development of cancer-associated acidic environments by suppressing a3 V-ATPase could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer metastasis.",

A major potential use of liposomes is for the delivery of antineoplastic agents to malignant tissue. However, liposome-cell interactions with both normal and neoplastic cells must be characterized in vitro to identify neoplastic tissues for which this approach may be most applicable in vivo. In this study, mouse melanoma-liposome interactions were examined in vitro. Small, unilamellar vesicle liposomes of three different phospholipid-cholesterol compositions were synthesized incorporating an aqueous phase fluorescent marker. Mouse melanoma had a significantly greater affinity for phosphotidylcholine-cholesterol liposomes than did mouse hepatocytes, as determined by comparing quantities of free intracellular 6-carboxyfluorescein in cells after a 15-min incubation with each of the three different liposome preparations (P less than 0.001). In addition, the efficiency of liposome internalization, calculated as the percentage of total cell-associated 6-carboxyfluorescein present as free, intracellular 6-carboxyfluorescein, was significantly greater for melanoma than for hepatocytes with all three liposome preparations (P less than 0.05). Therefore, in vitro liposome uptake by melanoma depends on lipid characteristics of the liposome preparation. Because melanoma uptake of liposomes appears to be a very efficient process in vitro, liposomes may be a useful vesicle for delivery of antineoplastic agents to melanoma in vivo.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Until today effective therapies are lacking for metastatic melanoma. The death ligand TRAIL appears as promising in cancer treatment; however, melanoma cells reveal both preexisting and inducible TRAIL resistance. Here, we present evidence that the recently described indirubin derivative 8-Rha-Î² enhances melanoma cell sensitivity for death ligands and overcomes resistance to TRAIL and CD95 agonists. Indirubin is known from traditional Chinese medicine and is a potent kinase inhibitor. Unraveling of apoptotic signaling pathways revealed that TRAIL resulted in a quick (within 8h) downregulation of both agonistic TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5, in a kind of negative feed-back loop. Treatment with indirubin, however, mediated upregulation of both receptors, thus compensating this negative feed-back loop by TRAIL. Furthermore, indirubin activated intrinsic apoptosis pathways, seen in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. The mitochondrial response appeared as related to upregulation of Bax and Bad and to downregulation of Mcl-1. Remarkably, indirubin in combination with TRAIL was also able to overcome apoptosis resistance due to ectopic Bcl-2 overexpression. The tumor suppressor p53 appeared as master regulator of these propapoptotic changes and is the transactivator of proapoptotic proteins which was upregulated by indirubin. Taking into account the physiological role of death ligands in immune surveillance, sensitization of melanoma cells for death ligands may be supportive for an anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, combinations with kinase inhibitors, such as indirubin 8-Rha-Î² may help for a breakthrough of TRAIL-mediated strategies in melanoma.",

We recently reported that synthetic Pho-s has potent effects on a wide variety of tumor cells. To determine if Pho-s has a potential antitumor activity, in this study we evaluated the activity of Pho-s against the B16-F10 melanoma both in vitro and in mice bearing a dorsal tumor. The treatment of B16F10 cells with Pho-s resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. At low concentrations, this activity appears to be involved in the arrest of the cell cycle at G2/M, while at high concentrations Pho-s induces apoptosis. In accordance with these results, the loss of mitochondrial potential and increased caspase-3 activity suggest that Pho-s has dual antitumor effects; i.e. it induces apoptosis at high concentrations and modulates the cell cycle at lower concentrations. In vivo, we evaluated the effect of Pho-s in mice bearing B16-F10 melanoma. The results show that Pho-s reduces the tumoral volume increasing survival rate. Furthermore, the tumor doubling time and tumor delays were substantially reduced when compared with untreated mice. Histological analyses reveal that Pho-s induces changes in cell morphology, typical characteristics of apoptosis, in addition the large areas of necrosis correlating with a reduction of tumor size. The results presented here support the hypothesis that Pho-s has antitumor effects by the induction of apoptosis as well as the inhibition of cell proliferation by arrest at G2/M. Thus, Pho-s can be regarded as a promising agent for the treatment of melanoma.",

The expression of osteopontin (OPN or OP), a protein ligand for the integrin alpha v beta 3, also correlates with metastatic potential of some tumors. Analysis of signal transduction, stimulated by OPN/alpha v beta 3 in human melanoma cells (M21), revealed activation of pp60c-src associated with the integrin. pp60c-src stimulation by OPN was dose dependent, and it was inhibited in vitro by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin-A. To determine the need for the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha v-subunit, in the association of pp60c-src with alpha v beta 3, a cell line expressing truncated alpha v was studied. M21-L cells lacked alpha v expression but stably transfected with complementary DNAs encoding alpha v full length protein alpha v 1018 or alpha v 995 (lacking 23 carboxyl-terminal amino acids), and a fibroblast cell line (FG) expressing alpha v beta 5 but not alpha v beta 3, were used. Western analysis and immune complex kinase assays of anti- alpha v immunoprecipitates demonstrated that M21-L/alpha v995 cells did not exhibit pp60c-src association with alpha v, whereas the alpha v1018 complementary DNA transfected cells and FG cells had pp60c-src associated with the alpha v integrins. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed pp60c-src, alpha v beta 3 integrin, and actin distribution along the plasma membrane of M21 cells. 35S-labeling of cells and analysis of complexes immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody against alpha v beta 3 demonstrated association of actin with the immune complexes.

In contrast, B16-LS9 cells grew at slower rates in vitro than B16-F10, unless hepatocytes in coculture, or a liver plasma membrane-extract, were present. In vivo, tumors produced by B16-LS9 cells after subcutaneous or intrafootpad injection also grew at slower rates than those produced by B16-F10, and appeared to progressively lose their liver specificity. However, after intravenous (tail vein) or intrasplenic inoculation, liver colonization was much more pronounced with B16-LS9 than B16-F10 cells. These data indicate that liver colonization by the B16-LS9 cell line depends primarily on the inability of these cells to grow efficiently at sites other than the liver.

As p33ING2 shares 58.9% homology with p33ING1b, we hypothesized that p33ING2 shares functional similarities with p33ING1b. We previously found that p33ING1b cooperates with p53 to enhance UVB-induced apoptosis. Here, we report that overexpression of p33ING2 enhanced apoptosis in UVB-irradiated and non-irradiated melanoma MMRU cells. We demonstrate that enhancement of apoptosis by p33ING2 requires the presence of functional p53. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of p33ING2 significantly downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 after UVB irradiation, resulting in an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Moreover, we found that p33ING2 promoted Bax translocation to mitochondria, altered the mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced cytochrome c release and thus the activation of caspases 9 and 3. In addition, we showed that under non-stress conditions p33ING2 upregulates Fas expression and activates caspase 8. Taken together, we demonstrate that p33ING2 cooperates with p53 to regulate apoptosis via activation of both the mitochondrial/intrinsic and death-receptor/extrinsic apoptotic pathways.",

To correlate the induction of SOCS 3 by interferons (IFNs) on messenger RNA and protein levels with STAT 1 phosphorylation in human malignant melanoma cell lines, we used a unique collection of 18 established malignant melanoma cell lines and six human non-malignant normal cells (two melanocytes, two skin keratinocytes and two fibroblasts). IFN-gamma induced SOCS 3 in 83% of melanoma cell lines, whereas IFN-alpha stimulated SOCS 3 expression in only 11% of cases. Similarly, melanocytes showed strong induction of SOCS 3 by IFN-gamma and, to a lesser extent, by IFN-alpha. In most cases, SOCS 3 expression was paralleled by STAT 1 phosphorylation at tyrosine residues (Y701). In several lines, however, SOCS 3 was not induced despite STAT 1 phosphorylation and, in a few lines, SOCS 3 induction occurred without detectable STAT 1 phosphorylation, indicating that STAT 1 might not be an exclusive inducer of SOCS 3. Similarly, non-malignant cells displayed STAT 1 activation and high levels of SOCS 3 expression after IFN-gamma (but not IFN-alpha) treatment. In conclusion, in contrast to IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma appeared to induce SOCS 3 apparently at the transcription level and exhibited higher cytotoxic effects regardless of the cell origin.",

Furthermore, it is a major component of the lipid barrier in the stratum corneum of the human epidermis. Considering that steroid hormone synthesis is taking place in epidermal melanocytes, we tested whether downstream oestrogen receptor/cAMP signalling via MITF/tyrosine hydroxylase/tyrosinase/pigmentation could be possibly modulated by cholesterol. For this purpose, we utilized human primary melanocyte cell cultures and human melanoma cells with different pigmentation capacity applying immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, Western blotting and determination of melanin content. Our in situ and in vitro results demonstrated that melanocytes can synthesize cholesterol via HMG-CoA reductase and transport cholesterol via LDL/Apo-B100/LDLR. Moreover, we show that cholesterol increases melanogenesis in these cells and in human melanoma cells of intermediate pigmentation (FM55) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cellular cholesterol levels in melanoma cells with different pigmentation patterns, epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes do not differ except in the amelanotic (FM3) melanoma cell line. This result is in agreement with decreasing cholesterol content versus increasing pigmentation in melanosomes. Cholesterol induces cAMP in a biphasic manner i.e. after 30 min and later after 6 and 24 h, meanwhile protein expression of oestrogen receptor beta, CREB, MITF, tyrosine hydroxylase and tyrosinase is induced after 72 h. Taken together, we show that human epidermal melanocytes have the capacity of cholesterol signalling via LDL/Apo-B100/LDL receptor and that cholesterol under in vitro conditions increases melanogenesis.",

We prepared novel fluorescent N-(2-dialkylaminoethyl)benzamides to prove this presumption. Lysosomotropic probes showed a melanin affinity comparable to benzamides. Lysosomal markers and benzamides colocalized in acidic organelles. Various nonmelanoma cell lines showed equal benzamide uptake and retention compared with melanoma cells. In nonmelanoma cells the amount of retained benzamides correlates with the number of acidic cell organelles. Benzamides almost completely failed to accumulate in melanoma cells with neutralized acidic organelles but normal melanin content. In melanoma retention of benzamides, acidic cell organelles are the main determinant. N-(2-dialkylaminoethyl)benzamides are lysosomotropic probes with high accumulation in nonmelanoma tumors with many acidic cell organelles. Alkylating benzamides were reported previously to show a melanoma unselective, in general enhanced cytotoxicity. Alkylating benzamides can act as lysosomotropic detergents or as DNA alkylators. The ability of alkylating benzamides to disrupt the membrane of lysosomes and cause liberation of lysosomal-trapped fluorescent dyes was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. Whether they act as an alkylating agent or a lysosomotropic detergent in a specific cell line is dependent on the amount of acidic cell organelles. In cell lines with small amounts of acidic cell organelles alkylating benzamides act as alkylating agents, whereas in cell lines with many acidic cell organelles they act as lysosomotropic detergents.

In this work, we conducted a series of in vitro studies to examine the influence of FCSPs products from Sargassumhenslowianum C. Agardh (FSAR) and Fucus vesiculosus (FVES), respectively, on proliferation of melanoma B16 cells and to investigate the underlying apoptosis promoting mechanisms. Cell viability analysis showed that both FCSPs products, i.e., FSAR and FVES, decreased the proliferation of the melanoma cells in a dose-response fashion, with FSAR being more potent at lower dosages, and FVES being relatively more anti-proliferative than FSAR at higher dosages. Flow cytometric analysis by Annexin V staining of the melanoma cells exposed to the FCSPs products confirmed that both FSAR and FVES induced apoptosis. The FCSPs-induced apoptosis was evidenced by loss of plasma membrane asymmetry and translocation of the cell membrane phospholipids and was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3. The FCSPs bioactivity is proposed to be attributable to distinct structural features of the FCSPs, particularly the presence of sulfated galactofucans (notably in S.henslowianum) and sulfated fucans (notably in F. vesiculosus). This study thus indicates that unfractionated FCSPs may exert bioactive effects on skin cancer cells via induction of apoptosis through cascades of reactions that involve activation of caspase-3.",

The persistence of antitumor protection and dose dependency was also examined in preimmunized animals. To evaluate the immune performance of tumor-bearing and tumor-operated mice, ovoalbumin-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity, cytokine secretion, and cell proliferation responses were studied.;Surgical excision of B16F10 tumors improved survival, and perioperative immunization with four biweekly GM3/VSSP doses yielded survival for all animals (P = 0.04; log-rank test).

        "Doc_abstract":"As G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the target of numerous signaling molecules, including about half of the therapeutic drugs currently used, it is important to understand the consequences of homologous (ligand-induced) receptor regulation. Continuous exposure of GPCRs to agonist in vitro most frequently results in receptor down-regulation, but receptor up-regulation may occur as well. These phenomena are expected to play a role in the physiological adaptation to endogenous ligands and also in the response to repetitive administration of drugs in the clinic. However, there is little information on homologous regulation of GPCRs in vivo. Here, we report on the regulation of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) expression in melanoma cells implanted into mice. Two melanoma cell lines were investigated, D10 and B16F1, which in vitro had previously been shown to undergo homologous receptor up- and down-regulation, respectively. After implantation into mice and exposure to the natural MC1R agonist alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), cell-surface MC1R expression was evaluated by competition binding experiments in tumor membrane preparations. In B 16F1 cells, a single injection of 50 to 500 microg alpha-MSH induced a rapid but moderate dose-dependent MC1R down-regulation which could be totally reverted within 16-24 h. By continuous administration of alpha-MSH via osmotic minipumps, MC1R down-regulation was considerably amplified and reached the level observed in vitro, demonstrating that prolonged receptor interaction was necessary to induce a maximal effect in vivo. Similar results were obtained in vitro, which demonstrates that homologous MC1R regulation in B16F1 cells is essentially independent of the physiological environment. In D10 cells, however, up-regulation could not be reproduced in vivo, suggesting that MC1R up-regulation is more dependent on the physiological environment. These results demonstrate the importance of in vivo receptor regulation studies, in particular in view of the potential use of MC1R as a target for melanoma therapy.",

The K+ channel blockers quinidine, tetraethylammonium chloride and Ba2+ and elevated extracellular K+ caused a dose-dependent membrane depolarization. This depolarization was correlated to an inhibition of cell proliferation. Charybdotoxin affected neither membrane voltage nor proliferation. Basic fibroblast growth factor and fetal calf serum induced a transient peak in intracellular Ca2+ followed by a long-lasting Ca2+ influx. Depolarization by voltage clamp decreased and hyperpolarization increased intracellular Ca2+, illustrating a transmembrane flux of Ca2+ following its electrochemical gradient.

Two human melanoma cell lines showing moderate (Mel-RM) and high (IgR3) sensitivity to vincristine were selected from a panel of eight melanoma lines for analysis. Induction of apoptosis was caspase dependent, and was associated with increases in mitochondrial membrane permeability. Vincristine upregulated the expression of Bax, Bak, PUMA, Noxa, p53 and p21 proteins, and downregulated and/or phosphorylated the Bcl-2 protein. Inhibitors of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, significantly inhibited vincristine-induced apoptosis in both IgR3 and Mel-RM cells. In addition, vincristine induced phosphorylation and reduction in Bcl-2 was prevented by an inhibitor of JNK. Downregulation of mRNA for p53, PUMA or Bim by RNA interference had little or no influence on vincristine-induced apoptosis in IgR3 cells. In addition, silencing Bim mRNA did not affect vincristine-induced apoptosis in Mel-RM cells. These results suggest that vincristine-induced apoptosis of at least some melanoma cell lines is dependent on the activation of JNK.

        "Doc_abstract":"Defective cytochrome c release and the resulting loss of caspase-3 activation was recently shown to be essential for the susceptibility of human melanoma cells to CD95/Fas-induced apoptosis. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria is regulated by the relative amounts of apoptosis-promoting and apoptosis-inhibiting Bcl-2 proteins in the outer membrane of these organelles. The assignment of Bax/Bcl-2 ratios by quantitative Western blotting in 11 melanoma cell populations revealed a relation to the susceptibility to CD95-mediated apoptosis. We could show that a low Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was characteristic for resistant cells and a high Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was characteristic for sensitive cells. Low Bax expression was not a consequence of mutations in the p53 coding sequence. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was also in clear correlation with sensitivity to another cell death inducer, N-acetylsphingosine. Furthermore, Bcl-2 overexpression abolished apoptosis triggered by both apoptotic stimuli, confirming the critical role of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as a rheostat that determines the susceptibility to apoptosis in melanoma cells by regulating mitochondrial function. Interestingly, some chemotherapeutics lead to the activation of death pathways by CD95L upregulation, ceramide generation, direct activation of upstream caspases, or upregulation of proapoptotic genes. Taken together, these signals enter the apoptotic pathway upstream of mitochondria, resulting in activation of this central checkpoint. We therefore assumed that apoptosis deficiency of malignant melanoma can be circumvented by drugs directly influencing mitochondrial functions. For this purpose we used betulinic acid, a cytotoxic agent selective for melanoma, straightly perturbing mitochondrial functions. In fact, betulinic acid induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation in both CD95-resistant and CD95-sensitive melanoma cell populations, independent of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.",

The cells have been shown to express the C3b-cleaving membrane protease p65. To delineate the molecular consequences of the C3b-cleaving activity for the complement cytotoxicity, the molecular events during the initiation (R24 monoclonal antibody, C1), amplification (C4, C3), and membrane attack (C5, C9) phases of complement were studied in comparison to a complement-susceptible human melanoma line (SK-MEL-93-2). No cleavage of C4b and C5b, 2 molecules structurally similar to C3b, was observed on the cells during classical pathway activation indicating the specificity of the p65 protease for the C3b molecule. The rapid degradation of C3b by p65 on the surface of complement-resistant SK-MEL-170 cells generates a M(r) 30,000 C3 alpha'-chain-fragment detectable as early as 1 min after complement activation, whereas no such fragment was present in detectable amounts on complement-susceptible cells. As a result of the rapid C3b proteolysis by p65 on resistant SK-MEL-170 cells, less C5 convertases are formed, which in turn results in the formation of a lower number of terminal complement components and membrane attack complexes. R24 antibody and C1q binding to the resistant cells was slightly lower as to susceptible cells. C4 binding studies, however, revealed that the observed difference in antibody and C1q binding has no influence on the complement resistance of SK-MEL-170 cells: significantly more C4b was bound to complement-resistant (1565 +/- 92 fg/cell) as compared to susceptible cells (715 +/- 31 fg/cell). On extraction of the molecular forms of C4 bound to the cell membranes, an additional high molecular weight C4 species--apparently a C4b-C4b homodimer--appeared only on the resistant SK-MEL-170 cells that may function as a residual back-up C5 convertase. Collectively, these results show that SK-MEL-170 human melanoma cells evade complement-mediated cytolysis despite sufficient activation of early components of the classical complement pathway by p65-mediated rapid degradation of surface-bound C3b, leading to a significant reduction in membrane attack complex formation. Thus, rapid cleavage of surface deposited C3b was established as a powerful mechanism of complement resistance.",

Therefore, the development of an alternative approach replacing the traditional therapy is urgently needed. To assess the killing efficiency of the functionally identified apoptosis-related protein (APR)-1 in melanoma cells, we established a system for the regulated expression of APR-1. The induction of APR-1 expression caused apoptosis of melanoma cells via the interaction with the juxtamembrane region of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and possible also via the competition with tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) and the catalytic receptor of neurotrophin (Trk) for the same p75NTR interacting site. The accumulation of APR-1 in melanoma cells may block the physical association of p75NRT with TRAF6 and/or Trk, leading to the disruption of both NF-ÎºB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Also, accumulation of APR-1 protein enhanced the activity of both c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways. However, the analysis of APR-1-modulated pathways demonstrated the involvement of apoptosis-regulating kinase 1-JNK/p38 pathway in the induction of Bax expression leading to both mitochondrial dysregulation [as demonstrated by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into cytoplasm, and cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)] and endoplasmic reticulum stress as demonstrated by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+)  release.

Growth inhibition assays using melanoma cell lines that either express the glycoprotein (Muc4(+)) or do not (Muc4(-)) showed that Muc4 renders cells resistant to taxol, doxorubicin, vinblastine, rhodamine 123, and 2-deoxyglucose. When treated with various concentrations of doxorubicin, Muc4(+) cells were blocked less frequently in G(2) and underwent less DNA fragmentation (apoptosis and/or necrosis) than Muc4(-) cells. All of the drugs tested (except for 2-deoxyglucose) are well recognized by P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and to a lesser degree by multidrug resistance related protein 1 (MRP1) transporters. Therefore, transporter gene expression in these cells was assayed. Surprisingly, Muc4(+) cells expressed lower levels of both transporter genes than Muc4(-) cells. Moreover, rhodamine 123 was retained more highly in the Muc4(+) than in the Muc4(-) cells, demonstrating that these transporters are functional.

Calcium ion was essential for this tumor cell-platelet interaction and could not be replaced by magnesium. Among the adhesive proteins containing RGD sequences that have been reported to enhance experimental metastasis, fibrinogen and thrombospondin significantly enhanced the aggregation induced by HMV-I cells, fibronectin and von Willebrand factor inhibited it, and vitronectin had no effect. To identify the platelet-aggregating factor(s) of the tumor cells, we have developed a monoclonal antibody against HMV-I cells that can inhibit HMV-I cell-induced platelet aggregation. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that this antibody recognized an Mr 71,000 membrane protein. These results suggest that the association between the tumor cells and platelets is mediated by the Mr 71,000 membrane protein recognized by this monoclonal antibody.",

These EPTs can be chemically labeled with Gd-DO3A-PDP, a Gd(III)-based MRI contrast agent bearing a 2-pyridinedithio chemical function for the recognition of EPTs. Uptake of gadolinium up to 10(9) Gd atoms per cell can be achieved. The treatment of B16 cells ex vivo with a reducing agent such as tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) results in an increase by 850% of available EPTs and an increase by 45% of Gd uptake. Blocking EPTs with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) caused a decrease by 84% of available EPTs and a decrease by 55% of Gd uptake. The amount of Gd taken up by B16 cells is therefore dependent upon the availability of EPTs, whose actual level in turn changes according to the extracellular redox microenvironment. Then Gd-DO3A-PDP has been assessed for the labeling of tumor cells in vivo on B16.F10 melanoma tumor-bearing mice. Gd-DO3A-PDP (or Gd-DO3A as the control) has been injected directly into the tumor region at a dose level of 0.1 Î¼mol and the signal enhancement in MR images followed over time. The washout kinetics of Gd-DO3A-PDP from tumor is very slow if compared to that of control Gd-DO3A, and 48 h post injection, the gadolinium-enhancement is still clearly visible. Therefore, B16 cells can be labeled ex vivo as well as in vivo according to a common EPTs-dependent route, provided that high levels of the thiol reactive probe can be delivered to the tumor.",

The FD determinant is carried by a Mr 90,000 glycoprotein (gp90) that binds to concanavalin A but not to lentil lectin or wheat germ agglutinin. After treatment with endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, the antigen no longer bound to concanavalin A. These and other properties indicate the gp90 carries mainly high mannose or hybrid N-linked carbohydrate chains. gp90 was partially purified from a detergent-solubilized membrane preparation by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, chelating Sepharose, and lectin-agarose columns. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the final preparation revealed three major components, one of which was identified as the FD antigen since it was specifically removed by precipitation with serum from patient FD. Immunization with the partially purified antigen preparation elicited anti-gp90 antibodies in two of four mice as demonstrated by sequential radioimmunoprecipitation experiments. Absorption experiments demonstrated that the mouse antibodies could, unlike human FD serum, be absorbed by a number of different cell types. Based on these results it is proposed that gp90 in SK-MEL-131 cells has two distinct epitopes, one, unique, detected by autologous FD serum, and another, common epitope or epitopes, detected by the polyclonal mouse sera. The common epitope(s) is present on gp90 in a variety of cells, including allogeneic melanomas and FD-B cells. These findings, which are compared with those on mouse tumor rejection antigens, have clear implications for the understanding of the nature of tumor antigens.",

The biologic mechanisms conferring these different drug-resistant phenotypes, including resistance against the commonly used anti-cancer drug cisplatin, are unclear. In order to elucidate the role of the membrane adenosine triphosphate binding cassette-transporter cMOAT (canalicular multispecific anion transporter) (MRP2/ABCC2) in cisplatin resistance of melanoma, the expression of this protein was analyzed in the platinum drug-resistant cell line MeWo CIS 1. Cisplatin-resistant melanoma cells showed a distinct overexpression of cMOAT on mRNA and protein level. This observation was accompanied by a reduced formation of platinum-induced intrastrand cross-links in the nuclear DNA measured by an immunocytologic assay. This decrease in DNA platination was accompanied by an accelerated re-entry into the cell cycle after the typical cisplatin-induced G2 arrest, and a resistance to undergo apoptosis. Kinetics of formation and elimination of platinum-DNA adducts suggest that the DNA repair capacity for Pt-d(GpG) adducts was not elevated in platinum drug-resistant melanoma cells. The decrease in platinum-DNA adduct formation in cisplatin-resistant melanoma cells was rather a reflection of the protecting activity of the transporter cMOAT. In conclusion, the functional inhibition of cMOAT might be a promising strategy in the reversal of resistance to platinum-based anti-cancer drugs in human melanoma.",

Loss of membranous E-cadherin is seen in a small number of vertical growth phase melanomas only when metastasis has occurred. However, there is a concomitant dramatic loss of membranous P-cadherin expression in all melanomas at the same stage. A minority of metastatic melanomas show de novo membranous N-cadherin expression in comparison with dysplastic naevi and primary melanoma. Membranous expression of the desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein, was not seen in any tumour studied. Frequently, beta catenin is aberrantly produced in the cytoplasm of cells in dysplastic naevi and metastatic malignant melanoma, with an implied compromise to adhesive function. Furthermore, membranous gamma catenin expression was not seen in any of the 70 melanocytic tumours studied, implying obligatory transmembrane binding of cadherins to beta catenin for maintenance of adhesive function.;The most important alterations in membranous cadherin and catenin expression are seen late in the biological progression of melanocytic tumours at the stage of \"in transit\" or regional lymph node metastasis, with implications for tumour growth, invasion, and dissemination.",

They are preferentially distributed along the choroid, the meninges, the subserous space of the oesophagus and the intestinal tract, at transitional areas of mucous membranes, and along organ capsules, the periadventitial tissues of major blood vessels, and, occasionally, muscle fasciae. Little is known about their biological behaviour; the prognosis, however, generally has to be considered less favourable than that of primary cutaneous malignant melanomas, probably at least in part because they are often not discovered until they are in advanced stages. There are no specific clinical signs suggestive for non-cutaneous malignant melanomas; symptoms vary with the site of manifestation of the tumours. Interpretation of these clinical data based on results from comparative anatomical studies leads to the conclusion that extracutaneous malignant melanomas in humans are residuals of phylogenetically old, extensive and well-developed non-cutaneous pigment cell patterns demonstrable in a variety of lower vertebrates, which result from interactions between organogenesis and pigment cell development during ontogeny. This demonstrates that consideration of fundamental principles of developmental biology can give diagnostic clues to the localizations at which primary non-cutaneous malignant melanomas may be suspected and can thus facilitate decisions about what diagnostic procedures are necessary.",

Electroporation uses short and intense electric pulses to induce a transient permeabilization of the cell membrane by creation of pores, thus allowing molecules, such as chemotherapeutic agents, to freely diffuse into the cytosol. ECT has shown to be effective and clinically well tolerated in the local control of primary and metastatic solid tumors of diverse histotypes in preclinical and clinical studies, thus, emerging as useful local treatment modality for disseminated superficial melanoma. So far, only a few data on the role of immunological response in ECT-treated patients have been reported.;Treatment regimens combining ECT to biological response modifiers (interleukin-2, interferon) and immunotherapeutic compounds should be further explored in animal and human cancer models; immunotherapy combined to ECT could broaden the therapeutic indications of ECT, by rendering it effective also on distant unreachable or untreated lesions.",

Growth of MCLD was considerably improved by 24 serial passages in a modified Hayflick's mycoplasma medium. Transmission electron microscopy showed that MCLD exhibits a polymorphic appearance, with ovoid or elongated cells frequently harboring an electron-dense core at one of the poles. Adherence of M. hyorhinis to melanoma cells followed saturation kinetics. Furthermore, although M. hyorhinis has been considered to remain attached to the surface of the host cells, we show for the first time, qualitatively by confocal laser scanning microscopy and quantitatively by a gentamicin resistance assay, that MCLD is able to invade melanoma cells. The ingested mycoplasmas were randomly distributed in the cytoplasm, tending to concentrate near the plasma membrane. Both adherence to and invasion of melanoma cells by M. hyorhinis strain MCLD were dramatically enhanced by mild proteolytic digestion with proteinase K (2.5 microg/mg cell protein for 2.5 min at 37 degrees C) that affected the surface-exposed proteins of this organism, mainly the major 47-kDa lipoprotein. We suggest that the intracellular location of M. hyorhinis strain MCLD is a privileged niche, which may explain the survival of M. hyorhinis in tissue cultures.

The metastatic phenotype has been shown to be largely determined by cell membrane properties. The cell membrane could therefore be considered as a possible target for antimetastatic drugs. In the present study we examined the effect of hyperthermia (the antitumoral effect of which is based, at least partly, on an action on the cell membrane) on the F1 and F10 variants of B16 melanoma. Cells of the more malignant variant, F10, were found to be markedly more sensitive to hyperthermic treatment than those of the less malignant one, F1. One hour in-vitro treatment by supranormal temperatures (ranging from 40 to 46 degrees C) resulted in a differential effect with regard to both proliferating capacity of the cells in vitro and tumorigenic ability following inoculation to mice. Our present results in the B16 melanoma corroborate data obtained by us in another tumour system, the AKR lymphoma. Study of the effect of membrane-acting agents on tumour variants differing in degree of malignancy might result in the finding of antitumoral agents efficient against advanced cancer.",

We found that curcumin caused cell death in eight melanoma cell lines, four with wild-type and four with mutant p53. We demonstrate that curcumin-induced apoptosis is both dose- and time-dependent. We found that curcumin did not induce p53, suggesting that curcumin activates other apoptosis pathways. Our data show that curcumin activates caspases-3 and -8 but not caspase-9, supporting the rationale that apoptosis occurs via a membrane-mediated mechanism. Both a caspase-8 and broad-based caspase inhibitor, but not a caspase-9 specific inhibitor, suppressed curcumin-induced cell death. To further support our hypothesis that curcumin induces activation of a death receptor pathway, we show that curcumin induces Fas receptor aggregation in a FasL-independent manner and that low-temperature incubation, previously shown to inhibit receptor aggregation, prevented curcumin-induced cell death. Moreover, we demonstrate that expression of dominant negative FADD significantly inhibited curcumin-induced cell death. In addition, our results indicate that curcumin also blocks the NF-kappaB cell survival pathway and suppresses the apoptotic inhibitor, XIAP.

Melanoma is not only a problem for humans but also for grey horses as they have a high potential of developing melanoma lesions coupled to the mutation causing their phenotype. Current chemotherapeutic treatment carries the risk of adverse health effects for the horse owner or the treating veterinarian by exposure to antineoplastic compounds. Most treatments have low prospects for systemic tumor regression. Thus, a new therapy is needed. In this in vitro study, Betulinic acid and its two derivatives B10 and NVX-207, both with an improved water solubility compared to Betulinic acid, were tested on two equine melanoma cell lines (MelDuWi and MellJess/HoMelZh) and human melanoma (A375) cell line. We could demonstrate that all three compounds especially NVX-207 show high cytotoxicity on both equine melanoma cell lines. The treatment with these compounds lead to externalization of phosphatidylserines on the cell membrane (AnnexinV-staining), DNA-fragmentation (cell cycle analysis) and activation of initiator and effector caspases (Caspase assays). Our results indicate that the apoptosis is induced in the equine melanoma cells by all three compounds. Furthermore, we succeed in encapsulating the most active compound NVX-207 in 2-Hydroxyprolyl-Î²-cyclodextrine without a loss of its activity. This formulation can be used as a promising antitumor agent for treating grey horse melanoma.

Previous studies have shown that the incidence of ras mutation increases with progression of melanoma, but that such mutations may not be present in the earliest radial growth phase melanomas. Recently it has been proposed that introduction of ras mutations into cells deficient in tumour suppressor genes such as p16 (INK4a) is sufficient to induce characteristics of cellular transformation such as anchorage-independent growth and tumour formation in vivo. To test this hypothesis in human melanoma, mutant N-ras, mutant H-ras or wild-type H-ras genes were transfected by electroporation into WM35 cells, a p16-deficient human melanoma cell line of low invasive potential. Increased expression of mutant ras p21 enhanced anchorage-dependent cell growth on tissue culture plastic. In addition, overexpression of mutant N-ras and H-ras, but not of wild-type H-ras, increased the experimental invasive potential, inducing anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, increasing cell motility measured by time-lapse video microscopy, and increasing invasiveness through reconstituted basement membranes. Finally, overexpression of mutant H-ras in melanoma cells was shown to increase tumorigenicity and to induce cachexia when H-ras transfected cell lines were injected subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Thus the addition of activating ras mutations to a melanoma cell line already deficient in p16 leads to enhanced proliferation, survival and migration in vitro and to enhanced subcutaneous tumour formation in vivo. This phenotype is typical of the behaviour of vertical growth phase (VGP) melanoma, and we propose that activation of the ras signalling pathway in the presence of deletions in p16 or related tumour suppressors can induce the VGP melanoma phenotype.",

The neuropilin genes, NRP1 and NRP2, share similar protein structure, but differ in their expression patterns, regulation, and ligand-binding specificities. NRPs vary in their expression patterns; for example, endothelial cells express both NRP1 and NRP2, lymphatic endothelial cells predominantly express NRP2, and epidermal cells predominantly express NRP1. NRP expression can be differentially regulated by transcription factors, e.g. prox-1 induces NRP2 while suppressing NRP1, or by growth factors, e.g. epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces NRP1 but not NRP2. Nearly all tumor cells express NRP1, NRP2, or both. Carcinomas express NRP1, whereas neuronal tumors and melanomas predominantly express NRP2. SEMAs play a role in neoplasms as angiogenesis inhibitors. For example, SEMA3F, which binds specifically to NRP2, inhibits tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Metastatic tumor cells lose SEMA3F expression during progression. Therefore, SEMA3F may have therapeutic potential.

Melanin transfer to keratinocytes requires specific recognition between keratinocytes and melanocytes or melanosomes. Cell surface sugar-specific receptor (membrane lectin) expression was studied in human C32 melanoma cells, an amelanotic melanoma, by flow cytometry analysis of neoglycoprotein binding as an approach to the molecular specificity. Sugar receptors on melanocytes are mainly specific for alpha-L-fucose. Their expression is enhanced upon treatment by the diacylglycerol analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, which can induce melanin synthesis in amelanotic human melanoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analyses showed a small-sized population of vesicles distinguishable from large cells by their fluorescence properties upon neoglycoprotein binding. Sorting indicated that the small-sized subpopulation is composed of vesicles produced by melanocytic cells. Upon vesicle formation, a selective concentration of sugar receptors specific for 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosides appears in the resulting melanocytic vesicles. Vesicles are recognized and taken up by cultured keratinocytes and a partial inhibitory effect was obtained upon cell incubation in the presence of neoglycoproteins, indicating a possible participation of sugar receptors in this recognition. The validity for such a model to help in understanding the natural melanin transfer by melanosomes is confirmed by electron microscopy, which demonstrates the presence of melanin inside keratinocytic cells upon incubation with melanocytic vesicles.",

An improved understanding of the molecular signals that trigger or attenuate the stress protein response is essential for advances to be made in this field. The present study provides evidence that the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol (BA), a documented nondenaturant, acts as a chaperone inducer in B16(F10) melanoma cells. It is demonstrated that this effect relies basically on heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) activation. Under the conditions tested, the BA-induced Hsp response involves the up-regulation of a subset of hsp genes. It is shown that the same level of membrane fluidization (estimated in the core membrane region) attained with the closely analogous phenethyl alcohol (PhA) does not generate a stress protein signal. BA, at a concentration that activates heat shock genes, exerts a profound effect on the melting of raft-like cholesterol-sphingomyelin domains in vitro, whereas PhA, at a concentration equipotent with BA in membrane fluidization, has no such effect. Furthermore, through the in vivo labeling of melanoma cells with a fluorescein labeled probe that inserts into the cholesterol-rich membrane domains [fluorescein ester of polyethylene glycol-derivatized cholesterol (fPEG-Chol)], we found that, similarly to heat stress per se, BA, but not PhA, initiates profound alterations in the plasma membrane microdomain structure. We suggest that, apart from membrane hyperfluidization in the deep hydrophobic region, a distinct reorganization of cholesterol-rich microdomains may also be required for the generation and transmission of stress signals to activate hsp genes.",

Previous studies from our laboratory have documented that membrane gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity can originate reactive oxygen species in the extracellular milieu, during the GGT-mediated metabolism of extracellular glutathione. The present study was aimed thus to verify a possible redox-modulating effect of GGT activity on TNFR1 receptors. The thiol-specific probe maleimide-polyethylene glycol was used to selectively label the reduced thiol groups in proteins of cell lysates; fractions corresponding to TNFR1 were then identified by immunoblot. In human melanoma Me665/2 cells, expressing varying GGT levels, at least five distinct forms of TNFR1 have been thus identified. The more oxidized forms appear to be prevalent in the 2/60 clone, expressing higher GGT levels, as compared to clone 2/21. Stimulation of GGT activity in the latter induced an increase of the oxidized TNFR1 forms. It is conceivable that different redox states of TNFR1 may correspond to different binding affinity and/or changes in the transducing function of the receptor. As GGT is frequently expressed by malignant tumors, the described phenomena might concur to alter the sensitivity of cancer cells to agents targeted on activation of TNF-alpha-dependent signaling pathways.",

Therefore it could be used as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in tyrosinase-positive melanomas. In order to develop serological reagents for the immunodetection of human tyrosinase and to find the most immunogenic region of the protein, we have raised a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against recombinant tyrosinase expressed and purified from bacteria. Epitope mapping revealed the 79 amino acid long stretch between 163 and 241 residues to be the most immunodominant region of the tyrosinase. This region could be further divided into three parts by binding different MAbs. These MAbs were very useful tools for the detection of tyrosinase expression from different constructs in tissue culture cells by immunocytochemistry and in melanocytes by immunohistochemistry. Some of the MAbs that recognized epitopes between 163 and 204 amino acids also recognized an additional distinct protein of about 70 kDa seen on Western blot analysis of transfected and non-transfected COS-7 cells. One of these, the MAb 4B1, was used in immunohistochemistry, and cross reaction with the basement membrane of the human tissue was observed. The analysis of the 4B1 MAb epitope showed that the C-terminal part of that region almost entirely overlaps with the sequence of the recently reported basement membrane protein beta-netrin.",

Inoculation of syngeneic mice with B16alpha vaccine cells triggers immunity to the parental B16 tumor that is mediated by host macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Lymph node cells from mice inoculated with irradiated B16alpha vaccine cells, but not with irradiated parental cells, proliferate when cultured in vitro, suggesting long-term in vivo activation of lymphoid cells. Long-term IFN-alpha treatment of B16alpha vaccine cells induced both interleukin-15 (IL-15) mRNA and IL-15 protein. The bulk of the induced IL-15 remained cell associated, either cytoplasmic or associated with the cell membrane. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed that the cell-associated IL-15 was broadly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that long-term IFN-alpha treatment may induce primarily the truncated isoform of IL-15. Vaccination with irradiated B16alpha vaccine cells may promote tumor immunity by releasing high levels of cell-associated IL-15 when spontaneously lysed or directly killed by innate immune cells. The release of accumulated cell-associated IL-15 may then trigger a host T cell response to tumor antigens and cause host development of immunity to the B16 tumor cells.",

This antibody is the basis for ongoing immunotherapy protocols at the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute. HMB-45, an antibody directed against a premelanosome glycoprotein, although used predominantly for the diagnosis of MM, has shown consistent staining in angiomyolipoma (AML), lymphangiomyoma/lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM), and clear cell sugar tumor (CCST), a group of tumors proposed to be related on the basis of their common perivascular epithelioid cells, which exhibit various degrees of smooth muscle differentiation, melanogenesis, and intracytoplasmic membrane bound granules. To compare the immunoreactive patterns of anti-MART-1 with those of HMB-45, we performed avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase testing on nonmelanocytic neoplasms (AMLs, LAMs, CCSTs) known to express HMB-45. Microwave pretreatment was necessary for anti-MART-1 staining on paraffin-embedded material. Our results showed that all of the 10 cases of AML were immunoreactive for both anti-MART-1 and HMB-45; that all of the 4 cases of LAM were positive for HMB-45, with 1 of the 4 reacting with anti-MART-1; and that 3 of the 4 cases of CCST expressed HMB-45, whereas 1 of the 4 was positive for anti-MART-1. Our findings lent additional support to previous studies that proposed a relationship between AML, LAM, and CCST. Anti-MART-1 and HMB-45 share similar specificities for these nonmelanocytic tumors, but the former seems to be a less sensitive marker for these lesions. In similar circumstances, anti-MART-1 and HMB-45 are potentially useful clinical markers.",

The Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway has been identified as a key player in melanoma development making this cascade an important therapeutic target. However, identification of the ideal pathway member to therapeutically target for maximal clinical benefit remains a challenge. In normal cells, the MAPK pathway relays extracellular signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus via a cascade of phosphorylation events, which promote cancer development. Dysregulation of the MAPK pathway occurs frequently in many human cancers including melanoma. Mutations in the B-RAF and RAS genes, genetic or epigenetic modifications are the key aberrations observed in this signaling cascade. Constitutive activation of this pathway causes oncogenic transformation of cells by promoting cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, migration, survival and angiogenesis. This review provides an overview of (a) key members of MAPK signaling regulating melanoma development; (b) key proteins which can serve as biomarkers to assess disease progression; (c) the clinical efficacy of various pharmacological agents targeting MAPK pathway; (d) current clinical trials evaluating downstream targets of the MAPK pathway; (e) issues associated with pharmacological agents such as drug resistance, induction of cancers; and finally (e) various strategies overcoming drug resistance.",

Human GGT-transfected melanoma cells were studied, and DNA damage was measured by using the alkaline comet assay. Our results indicate that higher levels of GGT activity are associated with higher levels of background DNA damage and oxidized bases. This association cannot be explained by differences in cell cycle distribution or apoptotic rates. GGT-over-expressing cells also presented with a markedly higher glucose uptake, a phenomenon potentially leading to higher metabolic rate and oxidative DNA damage. Anyway, when GGT-over-expressing cells were incubated in the presence of GGT substrates and a source of catalytic iron, increased levels of DNA damage and oxidized bases were observed, an effect completely prevented in the presence of GGT inhibitors or various antioxidants.The findings reported indicate that GGT activity is able to promote iron-dependent DNA oxidative damage, thus potentially representing an important mechanism in initiation/progression of neoplastic transformation.",

Our results have shown that lobaplatin inhibited cell proliferation in human melanoma A375 and CHL-1 cells and murine melanoma B16-F10 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry assay confirmed that lobaplatin affected B16-F10 cell survival by blocking cell cycle progression in G2/M phase and inducing apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the apoptosis was associated with downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 while upregulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Lobaplatin could also decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that lobaplatin may induce apoptosis via mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, lobaplatin blocked B16-F10 cell migration and invasion in vitro. These results suggested that lobaplatin could be an effective chemotherapeutic agent in melanoma treatment by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and blocking cell migration and invasion.

Tumor cells were deposited on the chicken chorioallantoic membrane of eggs 10 days postfertilization. Upon hatching, chickens were autopsied, and organs were removed, minced, and implanted s.c. in C57BL/6J mice (for melanoma) or nude mice (for glioma). A glioma growing s.c. from a chicken lung implant metastasized to the liver of the recipient nude mouse, and a melanoma growing s.c. from a chicken liver implant metastasized to the lung of its murine host. The s.c. melanoma contained distinct black and gray areas. Cell lines were established from the s.c. glioma (C6-V-1), from a metastasis of the C6-V-1 tumor (C6-V-2), and from the black and gray regions of the melanoma. Marked differences in lung colonization were seen 14 days after 1 X 10(5) parent BL6, Black, or Gray cultured cells were injected by tail vein into C57BL mice. In four separate experiments, fewer than 15 lung foci per mouse were found when BL6 cells were injected, whereas 100 to several hundred lung melanoma colonies per mouse were observed when Black or Gray cells were inoculated. Four of 18 nude mice bearing the s.c. C6-V-1 glioma developed liver metastases; no metastases have been observed in 15 nude mice bearing the s.c. parent C6 glioma. Significant differences in sensitivities to antineoplastic drugs were demonstrated between parent and variant glioma cell lines. The 33-fold increase in sensitivity to vincristine determined for C6-V-1 cells compared to parent C6 cells was particularly striking.

When cell-cell contact was established between melanocytes and undifferentiated, but not differentiated, keratinocytes, melanocytes proliferated at a rate similar to keratinocytes and they developed multiple dendrites. In co-cultures allowing the multi-layered growth of keratinocytes, melanocytes were nonproliferative when juxtaposed to undifferentiated keratinocytes in the basal layer, but proliferated when surrounded by differentiated keratinocytes in the intermediate and upper layers. Expression of melanoma-associated antigens on melanocytes decreased to similar levels as in normal skin when melanocytes were in direct contact with undifferentiated, but not differentiated, keratinocytes.;Undifferentiated, but not differentiated, keratinocytes control growth, morphology, and antigen expression of melanocytes through direct cell-cell contact.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of insulin on melanogenesis and cell growth in three different cell lines: the goldfish GEM-81 erythrophoroma cells (undifferentiated and differentiated with 1.5% dimethylsulfoxide-DMSO), and the murine B16F10 and Cloudman S91 melanoma cells. Undifferentiated GEM-81 and B16F10 cells responded to insulin with a small increase of cell proliferation, whereas S91 cells responded with a decrease of growth. In the two mammalian cell lines, and in DMSO-differentiated GEM-81 cells, the hormone strongly inhibited melanogenesis, by decreasing tyrosinase activity. In undifferentiated GEM-81 cells, insulin had no effect on tyrosinase activity. An increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of pp185 (insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 -- IRS-1/2) phosphorylation degree was observed in S91 mouse melanoma and in differentiated GEM-81 erythrophoroma cells, suggesting that this specific protein was maintained during transformation process and participates in insulin signaling.

Here we describe the temporal bone histopathology of 5 patients (10 temporal bones) who died of malignant melanoma with multiple metastasis to many internal organs and bones. We investigated the temporal bone based on the following three points: 1) the presence of metastatic lesions in the temporal bone, 2) inner ear pathology, and 3) the distribution of melanin in the inner ear. Normal melanin distribution was also studied in 35 temporal bones of patients without malignant melanoma. Metastatic malignant melanoma was observed in 5 temporal bones from 3 patients, in two of whom the internal auditory canal was involved bilaterally by melanoma cell infiltration. In the remaining patient (one ear), metastatic melanoma was found along the dura mater of the posterior cranial fossa to the mastoid air cells. In the former two patients, the inner and outer hair cells as well as the stria vascularis showed degenerative changes to various extents. In particular, the inner ear changes were severe in the ear with the decongestion of the inner ear vessels. Melanin was found in the modiolus, stria vascularis, osseous spiral lamina, membranous labyrinth, and endolymphatic sac, as previously reported. The amount of melanin in the inner ear increased with age in the control patients, but was greater than in the controls, in all of the cases of malignant melanoma except one, in which metastatic lesions were present in the internal auditory canal with marked congestion of the inner ear vessels.",

Indeed we have shown that annexin A1 is overexpressed in melanoma and promotes metastases by formyl peptide receptor stimulation and MMP2 expression. Here, we demonstrated in different melanoma cell lines that annexin A1-MMP2 induction is mediated by MAPK and STAT3 pathways. To decipher endogenous annexin A1 action mode, we showed that annexin A1 is externalized in A375 cells and cleaved by a membrane-associated serine protease, allowing the release of a pro-invasive annexin A1 peptide in the extra cellular environment. Finally, a biochemical and proteomic approach allowed to enrich eight out of 12 members of the annexin family and to identify an original annexin A1 cleavage site localized between Ser(28) and Lys(29). Altogether, these data identify signaling pathways involved in annexin A1 pro-invasive role and suggest that externalized full-length annexin A1 interacts with formyl peptide receptors in a juxtacrine manner while ANXA 2-28 release allows autocrine and paracrine interaction.

        "Doc_abstract":"Successful treatment of melanoma is still challenging, because metastasis remain chemoresistant and radioresistant. Accordingly, combinational treatments involving death ligands are mandatory. In a recent study from our lab, the majority out of 18 melanoma cell lines remained resistant against treatment with the death ligand TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand). Resistance was shown to be mainly due to incomplete processing of caspase-3 into catalytically inactive p21 by binding of the anti-apoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Co-irradiation with sub-lethal ultraviolet (UV) B caused depletion of XIAP resulting in synergistic sensitization of all but two melanoma cell lines to TRAIL. We show here the XIAP depletion to essentially require initial caspase-mediated cleavage, which promotes proteasomal degradation of XIAP. Utilizing specific caspase inhibitors and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown, we further identified caspase-3 to be responsible for performing the initial cleavage of XIAP after UVB treatment. Additional evidence suggests an accelerated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization in response to co-treatment with TRAIL and UVB, which directs the release of XIAP antagonizing factors including Smac. Distraction of XIAP consequently liberates caspase-3 to autocatalytically process into active p17. Activated caspase-3 cleaves XIAP and further enhances its activation in a positive regulatory feedback loop. The molecular mechanism discovered here appears to have broader implications, because cleavage of XIAP was also shown to accompany cisplatin-induced sensitization of melanoma cells to TRAIL.",

In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanism of docetaxel-induced apoptosis of human melanoma. We report that docetaxel induced varying degrees of apoptosis in a panel of melanoma cell lines but not in normal fibroblasts. Induction of apoptosis was caspase dependent and associated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential that could be inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2. Docetaxel induced changes in Bax that correlated with sensitivity to docetaxel-induced apoptosis. These changes in Bax were not inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2. Kinetic studies of caspase-2 activation by Western blotting and fluorogenic assays revealed that activation of caspase-2 seemed to be the initiating event. Inhibition of caspase-2 with z-VDVAD-fmk or by small interfering RNA knockdown inhibited changes in Bax and mitochondrial membrane potential and events downstream of mitochondria. Activation of caspase-8 and Bid seemed to be a late event, and docetaxel was able to induce apoptosis in cells deficient in caspase-8 and Bid. p53 did not seem to be involved as a p53 null cell line was sensitive to docetaxel and an inhibitor of p53 did not inhibit apoptosis.

In this study, binding sites for heparin and heparan sulfate on mouse B-16 melanoma cells have been demonstrated. Binding of 3H-heparin and 35S-heparan sulfate has been shown to occur to whole cells, isolated membranes, and to a component(s) of detergent extracts of the membranes. Scatchard analysis of binding of 3H-heparin yielded a Kd of 2-5 x 10(-8) M and a Bmax of 0.5 x 10(7) heparin molecules bound per cell. Binding of 35S-heparan sulfate was of at least an order of magnitude lower affinity than heparin, but the Bmax was similar to that for heparin. Competition studies showed that 35S-heparan sulfate binding was inhibited totally by heparin and heparan sulfate and partially by dermatan sulfate, but no inhibition was obtained with hyaluronate or chondroitin sulfate. Binding of 3H-heparin was inhibited totally by heparin but to different extents by preparations of heparan sulfate from different tissue sources. The heparin/heparan sulfate binding activity is a protein(s) because it is destroyed by treatment with trypsin. Binding of 3H-heparin to transblots of the detergent extract of the B-16 cell membranes indicated that at least part of the binding activity is a 14,000-dalton protein.",

Voltage steps to -100 mV induced a rise in [Ca2+]i and a creeping inward current. These effects were absent in Ca(2+)-free solution and could be blocked by Ni2+ or La3+. Voltage ramps revealed a close correlation between [Ca2+]i and voltage, with the strongest voltage dependence around the resting potential. Long-lasting tail currents, closely correlated with the rise in [Ca2+]i and a reversal potential close to the K+ equilibrium potential, occurred if the membrane potential was clamped back to 0 mV. They were absent if intracellular K+ was replaced by Cs+ and blocked by extracellular tetraethylammonium (5 mM), Ba2+ (1 mM), or a membrane-permeable adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate analogue. These observations are discussed in relation to cell proliferation.

GD2 has been used as a target for passive and active immunotherapy in patients with malignant melanoma and neuroblastoma. We have generated 47-LDA mimotope of GD2 by screening a phage display peptide library with anti-GD2 mAb 14G2a and reported that vaccination with the 47-LDA mimotope elicited GD2 cross-reactive IgG antibody responses as well as MHC class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells to syngeneic neuroblastoma tumor cells. The cytotoxic activity of the vaccine-induced CTLs was independent of GD2 expression, suggesting recognition of a novel tumor-associated antigen cross-reacting with 47-LDA. Immunoblotting studies using 14G2a mAb demonstrated that this antibody cross-reacts with a 105 kDa glycoprotein expressed by GD2(+) and GD2(-) neuroblastoma and melanoma cells. Functional studies of tumor cells grown in three-dimensional (3D) collagen cultures with 14G2a mAb showed decreases in matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation, a process regulated by 105 kDa activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecules (ALCAM/CD166). The CD166 glycoprotein was shown to be recognized by 14G2a antibody, and inhibition of CD166 expression by RNA interference ablated the cell sensitivity to lysis by 47-LDA-induced CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the vaccine-induced CTLs recognize a 47-LDA cross-reactive epitope expressed by CD166 and reveal a novel mechanism of induction of potent tumor-specific cellular responses by mimotopes of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens.",

In this study, the cytotoxic effect of oxymatrine, a natural quinolizidine alkaloid, against three human melanoma cell lines (A375, Sk-Mel-28, MM96L) and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Oxymatrine killed all three human melanoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The compound also dose-dependently caused apoptosis in human melanoma A375 cells. In addition, oxymatrine induced a remarkable change in mitochondrial membrane potential and triggered the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Furthermore, this small compound resulted in a marked activation of capase-3, caspase-9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, while caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK significantly reversed the proapoptotic effect of oxymatrine in A375 cells. Moreover, oxymatrine also dose-dependently increased the generation of reactive oxygen species in A375 cells, and N-acetylcysteine, a reactive oxygen species production inhibitor, almost completely blocked oxymatrine-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that oxymatrine triggers oxidative stress, resulting in the collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which in turn leads to cytochrome c release and apoptosis through the intrinsic caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway in human melanoma A375 cells.",

The cellular protein CAR (cell adhesion regulator) has been proposed to influence integrin-mediated binding to extracellular matrix proteins, including basement membrane (type IV) collagen. Three analogs of the CAR138-142 have been tested for activity. The first contains the 138-142 sequence (CAR138-142, Val-Glu-Ile-Leu-Tyr-NH2), the second contains the 138-142 sequence with a phosphorylated Tyr [pCAR138-142, Val-Glu-Ile-Leu-Tyr(PO3H2)-NH2], and the third contains the reversed 138-142 sequence (rCAR138-142, Tyr-Leu-Ile-Glu-Val-NH2). When added extracellularly, none of the analogs had a significant affect on cell adhesion to type IV collagen. Using a novel reversible cell permeabilization method, we found that intracellular incorporation of both CAR138-142 and pCAR138-142 resulted in inhibition of cell adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion. The IC50 values were approximately 90 and approximately 10 microM for CAR138-142 and pCAR138-142, respectively. Intracellular incorporation of the rCAR138-142 peptide had no affect on cell adhesion. Fluorescence microscopy of a fluorescein-labeled CAR138-142 peptide revealed that the reversible permeabilization procedure resulted in the peptides crossing the cell membrane. Affinity chromatography of melanoma cell lysates with pCAR138-142 or rCAR138-142 attached to a solid support of magnetic beads suggested that one protein was bound uniquely by pCAR138-142. Immunoprecipitation analysis identified vinculin, a protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton, as the protein specifically bound by pCAR138-142. Immunoprecipitation with pp125FAK- or beta 1-integrin-derived mAbs gave negative results.

In line with this, the role of BNIP3 in cancer is highly controversial and increased BNIP3 levels in cancer patients have been linked with both good as well as poor prognosis. In this study, using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral transduction to stably knockdown BNIP3 (BNIP3-shRNA) expression levels in melanoma cells, we show that BNIP3 supports cancer cell survival and long-term clonogenic growth. Although BNIP3-shRNA increased mitochondrial mass and baseline levels of reactive oxygen species production, which are features associated with aggressive cancer cell behavior, it also prevented cell migration and completely abolished the ability to form a tubular-like network on matrigel, a hallmark of vasculogenic mimicry (VM). We found that this attenuated aggressive behavior of these melanoma cells was underscored by severe changes in cell morphology and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton associated with loss of BNIP3. Indeed, BNIP3-silenced melanoma cells displayed enhanced formation of actin stress fibers and membrane ruffles, while lamellopodial protrusions and filopodia, tight junctions and adherens junctions were reduced. Moreover, loss of BNIP3 resulted in re-organization of focal adhesion sites associated with increased levels of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase. Remarkably, BNIP3 silencing led to a drop of the protein levels of the integrin-associated protein CD47 and its downstream signaling effectors Rac1 and Cdc42. These observations underscore that BNIP3 is required to maintain steady-state levels of intracellular complexes orchestrating the plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton, which is integral to cell migration and other vital processes stimulating cancer progression. All together these results unveil an unprecedented pro-tumorigenic role of BNIP3 driving melanoma cell's aggressive features, like migration and VM. ",

It was shown that vitamin C is taken up as DHA by most cell types, including cancer cells, via the facilitative GLUT transporters. Thus, AA oxidation to DHA can be considered a mechanism favoring vitamin C uptake and intracellular accumulation. We have investigated whether such an AA-oxidizing action might be provided by plasma membrane gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), previously shown to function as an autocrine source of prooxidants. The process was studied using two distinct human metastatic melanoma clones. It was observed that the Me665/2/60 clone, expressing high levels of membrane GGT activity, was capable of effecting the oxidation of extracellular AA, accompanied by a marked increase of intracellular AA levels. The phenomenon was not observed with Me665/2/21 cells, possessing only traces of membrane GGT. On the other hand, AA oxidation and stimulation of cellular uptake were indeed observed after transfection of 2/21 cells with cDNA coding for GGT. The mechanism of GGT-mediated AA oxidation was investigated in acellular systems, including GGT and its substrate glutathione. The process was observed in the presence of redox-active chelated iron(II) and of transferrin or ferritin, i.e., two physiological iron sources. Thus, membrane GGT activity-often expressed at high levels in human malignancies-can oxidize extracellular AA and promote its uptake efficiently.",

To develop effective treatment options, we have examined the effect of honokiol, a phytochemical from Magnolia plant, on the migratory potential of human melanoma cell lines (A375, Hs294t, SK-Mel119 and SK-Mel28) and assessed whether Nox1 is the target. Using an in vitro cell migration assay, we observed that treatment of different melanoma cell lines with honokiol for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell migration that was associated with reduction in Nox1 expression and reduced levels of oxidative stress. Treatment of cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an anti-oxidant, also inhibited the migration of melanoma cells. Treatment of cells with diphenyleneiodonium chloride, an inhibitor of Nox1, significantly decreased the migration ability of Hs294t and SK-Mel28 cells. Further, we examined the effect of honokiol on the levels of core proteins (p22(phox) and p47(phox)) of the NADPH oxidase complex. Treatment of Hs294t and SK-Mel28 cells with honokiol resulted in accumulation of the cytosolic p47(phox) protein and decreased levels of the membrane-bound p22(phox) protein, thus blocking their interaction and inhibiting Nox1 activation. Our in vivo bioluminescence imaging data indicate that oral administration of honokiol inhibited the migration/extravasation and growth of intravenously injected melanoma cells in internal body organs, such as liver, lung and kidney in nude mice, and that this was associated with an inhibitory effect on Nox1 activity in these internal organs/tissues.",

In this study we have investigated the cell surface expression of a CB-like enzyme on the surface of tumor cell variants expressing both high and low metastatic potentials. Cell surface CB-like activity was demonstrated by incubation of intact viable cells and isolated plasma membranes with the selective chromogenic substrate N-carbobenzoxyvalyllysyllysylarginyl-4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide. Cell surface CB activity required thiol activation and was blocked by the CB-selective protease inhibitors leupeptin, antipain, and L-trans-epoxysuccinylleucylamido(4-guanidino)butane, but not by inhibitors inactive against CB. Enzymatic activity was significantly reduced when assayed at pH 7 and greater. Although all tumor lines had detectable CB-like activity, we observed a correlation between the expression of cell surface CB-like activity and metastatic phenotype only with isolated plasma membranes, and not with whole cell preparations. Noncytolytic 2% butanol extraction, a technique known to increase the experimental metastatic propensity, also significantly increased cell surface CB-like activity. Incubation of extracted tumor cells with crude butanol extracts prepared from those cells restored the cell surface CB-like activity to that of the unextracted controls, suggesting that the increased enzyme activity observed following extraction may be due to the release of an endogenous cysteine protease inhibitor. These results demonstrate that a CB-like protease is expressed on the surface of several murine tumor cells and that an endogenous inhibitor may play a role in determining experimental metastatic phenotype.",

In human melanoma xenografts raised in mice, tumor necrosis factor-alpha selectively increased tumor vascular permeability by 3 hours and decreased tumor blood flow by 6 hours post-treatment relative to treated normal tissue. In an in vitro tumor endothelial cell model, tumor necrosis factor-alpha caused vascular endothelial adherens junction protein, VE-cadherin, to relocalize within the cell membrane away from cell-cell junctions leading to gapping between endothelial cells by 3 to 6 hours post-treatment. Phosphotyrosinylation was a prerequisite for movement of VE-cadherin away from endothelial cell junctions and for gapping between endothelial cells. Clinical isolated limb perfusion tumor specimens, at 3 hours postperfusion, showed a discontinuous and irregular pattern of VE-cadherin expression at endothelial cell junctions when compared with normal (skin) or pretreatment tumor tissue.;Together, the data suggest that tumor necrosis factor-alpha selectively damages the integrity of tumor vasculature by disrupting VE-cadherin complexes at vascular endothelial cell junctions leading to gapping between endothelial cells, causing increased vascular leak and erythrostasis in tumors.

Although scarcely expressed in adult tissues, Eph receptors and ephrins are overexpressed in a range of tumours. In malignant melanoma, increased Eph and ephrin expression levels correlate with metastatic progression. We have examined cellular and biochemical responses of EphA3-expressing melanoma cell lines and human epithelial kidney 293T cells to stimulation with polymeric ephrin-A5 in solution and with surfaces of defined ephrin-A5 densities. Within minutes, rapid reorganisation of the actin and myosin cytoskeleton occurs through activation of RhoA, leading to the retraction of cellular protrusions, membrane blebbing and detachment, but not apoptosis. These responses are inhibited by monomeric ephrin-A5, showing that receptor clustering is required for this EphA3 response. Furthermore, the adapter CrkII, which associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated EphA3 in vitro, is recruited in vivo to ephrin-A5-stimulated EphA3. Expression of an SH3-domain mutated CrkII ablates cell rounding, blebbing and detachment. Our results suggest that recruitment of CrkII and activation of Rho signalling are responsible for EphA3-mediated cell rounding, blebbing and de-adhesion, and that ephrin-A5-mediated receptor clustering and EphA3 tyrosine kinase activity are essential for this response.",

One episode of severe hypotension and fever was observed in a patient included at the highest dose level. Other toxicities consisted of local reactions at the site of injection and mild fever and chills. Five doses of GM3/VSSP induced an anti-GM3 IgM response in 44% of patients. Serum reactivity was also observed against melanoma cell lines and tumor biopsies. GM3/VSSP was shown to induce very strong in vitro IFNgamma secretion in all evaluated melanoma patients. Furthermore, in one patient IFNgamma secretion was shown to be GM3-specific.

The cells treated with hrIFN alpha for a short time period attached more readily to purified basement membrane components, type IV collagen and laminin, than control cells. The stimulating effect of hrIFN gamma on the attachment was seen, however, when the cells were treated for a longer period of time (3 days) with this drug. The short-term treatment with hrIFN alpha also enhanced the in vitro invasion of cells through a reconstituted basement membrane compared to findings with untreated control cells. Pre-treatment of 3 days or more was, however, needed for hrIFN gamma to promote the invasion of A2058 cells. Both IFNs increased the secretion of basement membrane (type IV) collagen degrading metalloproteinase (collagenase IV) activity from human melanoma cells. Further, chemotaxis, i.e., directed migration of A2058 cells to laminin, was enhanced by both IFNs. In contrast, the attachment, collagenase IV activity, chemotaxis, and in vitro invasion were markedly inhibited when the cells were treated for an extended time period (7 days) with the IFNs. Interferons also inhibited cell proliferation after 4 days of exposure. These results suggest that time of treatment with interferons modulates the invasive capacity of human melanoma cells in vitro, causing initially a transient enhancement of invasion followed by an inhibition of invasive propensity after extended exposure to these drugs, and that different biochemical steps required for successful invasion are regulated in parallel by interferons alpha and gamma.",

Incubation of plasma membranes isolated from cultured human melanoma cells with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+ and ethylene-bis-(oxyethylenenitrilo)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) resulted in specific phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on a 75kDa protein (pp75). 3.

Incubation of isolated plasma membranes with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+ and EGTA and immunochemical analysis by Western blotting with an anti pp75 xenoantiserum detected the pp75 in human melanoma, neuroblastoma, ovarian carcinoma and lymphoid T cells and fibroblasts but not in B-lymphoid cells, renal carcinoma cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes and splenocytes. 6.

In the present study, we have examined its ability to induce apoptosis in human melanoma cells and the mechanisms involved. Apoptosis was observed in Phenoxodiol-treated cells by using annexin V/propidium iodide staining and determining mitochondrial membrane potential. To determine which caspase pathways were involved in Phenoxodiol-induced apoptosis, studies were performed using specific caspase inhibitors. Western studies were performed to ascertain which proteins of the apoptosis cascade were affected to cause Phenoxodiol-induced apoptosis. We found that induction of apoptosis by Phenoxodiol was maximal at 48 h with a range of apoptosis of 12+/-4 to 48+/-5% in different melanoma lines. This apoptosis was mainly dependent on activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Apoptosis was associated with induction of changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and was inhibited by over-expression of Bcl-2. Variation in sensitivity to Phenoxodiol appeared related to events upstream of the mitochondria and the degree of conformational change in Bax. The p53-regulated BH3-only proteins (Bad, PUMA and Noxa) were increased in the sensitive, but not in the resistant lines, whereas Bim was increased in all the lines tested. Bim appeared, however, to be partially involved because reduction of Bim by RNA interference resulted in decreased levels of apoptosis. Together, these studies suggest that Phenoxodiol induces apoptosis of melanoma cells by induction of p53-dependent BH3 proteins (Bad, PUMA and Noxa) and the p53-independent Bim protein, resulting in activation of Bax and its downstream events.",

Currently, dual BRAF and MEK inhibition are ongoing in clinical trials with the goal of overcoming the acquired resistance that has unfortunately developed in some vemurafenib patients. FDG-PET measures of metabolic activity are increasingly employed as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for guiding single-agent or combination therapies by gauging initial drug response and monitoring disease progression. However, since tumors are inherently heterogeneous, investigating the effects of BRAF and MEK inhibition on FDG uptake in a panel of different melanomas could help interpret imaging outcomes.;18âF-FDG uptake was measured in vitro in cells with wild-type and mutant (V600) BRAF, and in melanoma cells with an acquired resistance to vemurafenib. We treated the cells with vemurafenib alone or in combination with MEK inhibitor GDC-0973. PET imaging was used in mice to measure FDG uptake in A375 melanoma xenografts and in A375 R1, a vemurafenib-resistant derivative. Histological and biochemical studies of glucose transporters, the MAPK and glycolytic pathways were also undertaken.;We demonstrate that vemurafenib is equally effective at reducing FDG uptake in cell lines harboring either heterozygous or homozygous BRAFV600 but ineffective in cells with acquired resistance or having WT BRAF status. However, combination with GDC-0973 results in a highly significant increase of efficacy and inhibition of FDG uptake across all twenty lines. Drug-induced changes in FDG uptake were associated with altered levels of membrane GLUT-1, and cell lines harboring RAS mutations displayed enhanced FDG uptake upon exposure to vemurafenib. Interestingly, we found that vemurafenib treatment in mice bearing drug-resistant A375 xenografts also induced increased FDG tumor uptake, accompanied by increases in Hif-1Î±, Sp1 and Ksr protein levels. Vemurafenib and GDC-0973 combination efficacy was associated with decreased levels of hexokinase II, c-RAF, Ksr and p-MEK protein.;We have demonstrated that 18âF-FDG-PET imaging reflects vemurafenib and GDC-0973 action across a wide range of metastatic melanomas. A delayed post-treatment increase in tumor FDG uptake should be considered carefully as it may well be an indication of acquired drug resistance.;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01271803.",

However, two forms of the enzyme, Ts1- and Ts2-tyrosinase, separated from the soluble fraction by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were shown to play no role in the transfer since little or no incorporation of radioactivity into tyrosinase in this fraction was found. It is suggested that most tyrosinase observed in the soluble fraction does not leak from the melanosomes or the microsomes during homogenization, but comes from necrotic tumor cells. It appears that melanosomal and microsomal tyrosinase might be released from the membrane of necrotic cells modified by various degradation enzymes, considering the data on the recovery of tyrosinase from the soluble fraction, where one-third of total enzyme activity in the postnuclear fraction could not be increased, even when the postnuclear fraction of the tumor was further homogenized radically.",

Degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) in mammalian cells is dependent upon the enzymatic activity of HPSE-1, an endo-beta-d-glucuronidase, which cleaves HS using a specific endoglycosidic hydrolysis rather than an eliminase type of action. Elevated HPSE-1 levels are associated with metastatic cancers, directly implicating HPSE-1 in tumor progression. The mechanism of HPSE-1 action to promote tumor progression may involve multiple substrates because HS is present on both cell-surface and ECM proteoglycans. However, the specific targets of HPSE-1 action are not known. Of particular interest is the relationship between HPSE-1 and HSPG, known for their involvement in tumor progression. Syndecan-1, an HSPG, is ubiquitously expressed at the cell surface, and its role in cancer progression may depend upon its degradation. Conversely, another HSPG, perlecan, is an important component of basement membranes and ECM, which can promote invasive behavior. Down-regulation of perlecan expression suppresses the invasive behavior of neoplastic cells in vitro and inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. In this work we demonstrate the following. 1) HPSE-1 cleaves HS present on the cell surface of metastatic melanoma cells. 2) HPSE-1 specifically degrades HS chains of purified syndecan-1 or perlecan HS. 3) Syndecan-1 does not directly inhibit HPSE-1 enzymatic activity. 4) The presence of exogenous syndecan-1 inhibits HPSE-1-mediated invasive behavior of melanoma cells by in vitro chemoinvasion assays. 5) Inhibition of HPSE-1-induced invasion requires syndecan-1 HS chains. These results demonstrate that cell-surface syndecan-1 and ECM perlecan are degradative targets of HPSE-1, and syndecan-1 regulates HPSE-1 biological activity. This suggest that expression of syndecan-1 on the melanoma cell surface and its degradation by HPSE-1 are important determinants in the control of tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

To apply this premise to human tumors, the effects of UC729-6 (lymphoblastoid B-cell) and M21-HPB (malignant melanoma) conditioned media (CM) on normal lymphocyte proliferation, as well as on tumor cell growth in autologous CM was studied. The CM was collected at 2-5 day intervals from cultures of UC729-6 and M21-HPB cells in serum-free media. Phytohemagglutinin- and concanavalin A-stimulated mononuclear peripheral blood cells from healthy human donors showed decreased [3H]thymidine ([3H]Tdr) uptake in the presence of each CM when compared with controls. In assays using 100% CM, mitogen stimulation was 68-85% less than that of controls and 40-50% less using 50% CM. The suppression was more pronounced with UC729-6 CM than with M21-HPB CM. In mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), addition of 50% CM from either tumor cell line resulted in 40-50% reduction in [3H]Tdr uptake by lymphocytes. Incubation of UC729-6 cells in 5% to 100% of UC729-6 fCM (filter-concentrated) produced a decrease in [3H]Tdr uptake which was directly proportional to the amount of fCM present. In contrast, M21-HPB cell growth in autologous fCM was dependent on cell number, as well as on the amount of fCM used. Treatment of the UC729-6 fCM using acid (pH 4.5), trypsin (100 micrograms/ml), and heat (56 degrees C) did not restore mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation.

To test this hypothesis, the authors have analyzed the interaction of malignant melanoma (ST-ML-12) multicenter tumor spheroids with endothelial cell monolayers in a three-dimensional coculture system. After 1.5 hours of interaction, the authors observed a toxic effect on endothelial cells in the perispheroid region. The latter was demonstrated by testing membrane integrity with the fluorescent probes acridine orange/ethidium bromide and resulted in sensitivity to shear stress of the damaged cells. The endothelium then underwent a regenerative cycle to replace the denuded halo. Addition of the oxygen radical-scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase to the culture medium prevented this endothelial cell damage in a dose-dependent manner for up to 12 hours. By contrast, catalase, deferoxamine mesylate, allopurinol, and the proteinase inhibitors soybean trypsin inhibitor and aprotinin were not protective under the same conditions. The endothelial damage was dependent on the attachment of the spheroids. Medium conditioned by ST-ML-12-spheroids proved to be ineffective. A similar, but less prominent, deleterious effect was seen when human peritoneal mesothelial cells were used in place of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Spheroids of the uroepithelial cell line HU-609 were used as control. No toxicity was observed in these cocultures. Melanin biosynthesis is associated with the production of oxygen-derived free radicals. The results suggest a possible implication of these free radicals in metastasis formation of malignant melanoma.",

In the in vitro model reported here, two melanoma clones (T1C3, which generates lung metastases in experimental animals, and IC8, which does not) derived from a single parental cell line were co-seeded with normal allogenic keratinocytes onto acellular human de-epidermized dermis with preserved intact basement membrane and cultured for up to 1 month at an air-liquid interface. Histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies showed that melanoma cells from the metastatic clone (T1C3), but not from the non-metastatic clone (IC8), penetrated the dermal-epidermal junction to invade the dermis after 3 weeks of culture. Local invasion was associated with the dissolution of the native epidermal basement membrane collagens type IV and VII. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis demonstrated that numerous T1C3 cells were able to colonize the interstitial dermis and to rapidly penetrate empty dermal cavities. Our model represents a significant technical advance over others currently available since: (i) the organized three-dimensional architecture of the native dermal-epidermal junction is preserved; (ii) the active invasion process coincides with the dissolution of native components of the epidermal basement membrane, i.e. collagen types IV and VII; and (iii) the ability of melanoma cells to cross the dermal-epidermal junction correlates with their metastatic potential. This model provides a valuable tool for the study of the time-course of the cellular and molecular events that occur during the earliest steps of invasion in cutaneous melanoma. It also offers new opportunities to study the possible role of the keratinocyte environment in melanoma invasion.",

Known detachment mechanisms include the slow sliding of focal contacts, the detachment of adhesion receptors by affinity and avidity regulation, as well as the shedding of adhesion receptors, most notably integrins. In highly invasive melanoma cells migrating within 3D collagen matrices, beta1 integrins and CD44 are released upon retraction of the trailing edge, together with ripping-off complete cell fragments to become deposited along the migration trail of remodeled matrix. Cell fragments reach a size up to 12 microm in diameter, contain cytoplasm and occasionally polymerized actin enclosed by intact cell membrane including surface beta1 integrins, but do not include nuclear material. The release of cell fragments was migration dependent, as impairment of motility by a blocking anti-beta1 integrin antibody also blocked cell particle release. Invasion-associated deposition of cell fragments combines the secretory-type release of vesicles with a physical mechanism of rear retraction and migration efficiency. The deposition of cell fragments may further represent a disregulated detachment strategy with implications for neoplastic cell behavior, such as the paracrine effects on neighbor cells or a negative impact on immune effector cells.",

Moreover, the studies elucidated some differences in cytotoxic effects between CEINs used as raw and purified materials composing of the carbon surface with acidic groups. Experiments showed that HTB-140 cells are more sensitive to prone early apoptotic events due to raw CEINs as compared to B16-F10 or HDF cells, respectively.

Hyaluronan synthesis was also enhanced in plasma membranes from fibroblasts that had been treated with hyaluronidase or trypsin.

These results indicated that nascent high-molecular-mass hyaluronan inhibited its own chain elongation, if it was retained in the vicinity of the synthase by cell-surface receptors.

In this study we demonstrate that seprase and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), co-localize in the plasma membrane of LOX malignant melanoma cells. Cells were labeled with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against seprase and uPAR. Proximity between these two molecules was detected with resonance energy transfer (RET) imaging, single-cell emission spectrophotometry, and single-cell excitation spectrophotometry. Significant RET signals were detected on LOX cells when adherent to uncoated and extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated surfaces. This indicates that seprase and uPAR are within approximately 7 nm in the plasma membrane of LOX cells. When LOX cells adhered to a 3D extracellular-like matrix, seprase-uPAR complexes were found to be associated with invadopodia. Further microscopy experiments demonstrated gelatinolytic activity, a functional attribute of seprase, in association with seprase-uPAR membrane domains. Formation of seprase-uPAR membrane complexes is dependent upon both the cytoskeleton and integrins. Specifically, the involvement of beta(1)-integrins was demonstrated by the inhibition of RET by an inhibitory anti-beta(1)-integrin mAb. Based on these findings, we speculate that formation of heterogeneous lytic domains in the invading membranes of LOX cells increases the efficiency of directed pericellular proteolysis.",

In the present study, we took this finding a step further, focusing on the ability of melanoma membrane-imprinted CD8+ T cells to act as APCs (CD8+ T-APCs). We demonstrate that, following trogocytosis, CD8+ T-APCs directly present a variety of melanoma derived peptides to fraternal T cells with the same TCR specificity or to T cells with different TCRs. The resulting T cell-T cell immune synapse leads to (1) Activation of effector CTLs, as determined by proliferation, cytokine secretion and degranulation; (2) Fratricide (killing) of CD8+ T-APCs by the activated CTLs. Thus, trogocytosis enables cross-reactivity among CD8+ T cells with interchanging roles of effectors and APCs.

        "Doc_abstract":"The primary activation pathway of T cells is via the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex, which is functionally interrelated with various accessory molecules. We examined the contribution of the lymphocyte-function-associated antigen-I/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (LFA-1/ICAM-1) interaction to CD3/TCR-mediated lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). We used ICAM-I-or+ tumor cell lines as target cells and anti-CD3- or anti-LFA-1 containing hetero-cross-linked monoclonal antibody (MAb) to bridge CTL and target cells and simultaneously to activate CTL. The ICAM-1- melanoma-derived cell line IgR39 was relatively resistant to CD3-mediated lysis by both TCR alpha beta + and TCR gamma delta + CTL, when compared with ICAM-1+ cell lines. Induction of ICAM-1 on the membrane of IgR39 cells by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) rendered these cells more susceptible to CD3-mediated lysis. Anti-ICAM-1 MAb inhibited this TNF-enhanced susceptibility to lysis, directly demonstrating that the induction of ICAM-1 was critical in the TNF-induced increase in susceptibility to lysis of IgR39 cells. CTL formed less efficient conjugates with the ICAM-1- cells as compared to ICAM-1+ cells. Both spontaneous and CD3-induced conjugate formation as well as CD3-mediated lysis of ICAM-1- tumor cells by CTL were enhanced by the addition of anti-LFA-1 containing hetero-cross-linked MAb, thereby mimicking the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction between CTL and target cells. Soluble anti-CD18 MAb inhibited CD3-mediated lysis of ICAM-1- target cells by CTL without affecting their conjugate formation. Anti-LFA-1 MAb added after conjugate formation still inhibited lysis of both ICAM-1+or- tumor cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction co-activates CD3/TCR-mediated lysis by CTL through both an enhanced CTL-target cell binding and the delivery of post-conjugate costimulatory signals.",

Several changes indicative of apoptosis were detected in Tm5 melanoma cells but not in melan-a cells treated with J18, such as the flipping of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the external side of the plasma membrane, altered nuclear morphology, DNA fragmentation, increase in mitochondria depolarization, and in caspase-3 activity. Retention of NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm was another alteration observed specifically in J18-treated Tm5 cells. No such alterations were found in Tm5 cells treated with GST.

The stromelysin metalloproteinase family is a major candidate for the matrix proteolytic activity in infiltrative tumors.

We have analyzed the expression of the newly described stromelysin 3 in human basal cell carcinoma using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. In 12 of 14 cases, levels of stromelysin 3 expression were more than tenfold above those observed in normal skin. In one of five cases of squamous cell carcinoma, stromelysin 3 expression was tenfold above levels seen in normal skin. Stromelysin 3 expression was either undetectable or extremely weak in all five cases of infiltrative malignant melanoma. In basal cell carcinoma, stromelysin 3 transcripts were localized by in situ hybridization to the stromal tissue immediately adjacent to basal cell carcinoma, the tumor cells themselves being negative. Therefore, expression of stromelysin 3 in stromal cells may be expected to play a significant role in destruction of the basal membrane zone and extracellular matrix in basal cell carcinoma invasion.",

Multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTS) of 14 human cancer cell lines and spheroids from two benign cell lines were transferred onto confluent monolayers of human endothelial cells (EC). MCTS from 4 of 7 melanoma cell lines induced damage of the endothelium which was closely associated with tumour cell attachment. Endothelial cell injury became evident morphologically by loss of cell membrane integrity and sensitivity to shear stress. Similar results were obtained with EC derived from human umbilical veins, umbilical arteries and saphenous veins. Addition of the oxygen radical scavenger catalase showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition (up to 48 h) of EC damage in the case of the melanoma cell lines ST-ML-11, ST-ML-14 and SK-MEL-28. The scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase proved to be protective (up to 12 h) in ST-ML-12 MCTS. In contrast, allopurinol, deferoxamine mesylate, ibuprofen, nor-dihydroguaretic acid, soybean trypsin inhibitor or aprotinin had no protective effect. None of the non-melanoma cancer cell lines or benign cells induced endothelial cell damage. Endothelial injury has been shown to enhance the process of metastasis.

In this paper, we describe a number of ultrastructural alterations in the cellular membranes following the exposure of orthotopic melanomas and red blood cells to trains of biphasic pulses. Specifically, melanoma xenografts grown in nude mice were subject to trains of eight biphasic pulses using an electric field of 1250 or 2450 V/cm, excised after 5 min and processed for electron microscopy. The freeze-fracturing analysis of both cell types evidenced defects in the dynamic assembly of lipids and proteins, which generate \"areas with rough structure\" and intensive clustering of intramembrane proteins. Such modifications could be the hallmarks of lipid and protein alterations, of protein cohesion reduction, and of changes in lipid orientation inside cell membranes, as postulated in several mathematical models applied to electroporation, and warrant further investigations.",

In this study, we have investigated apoptosis induced by the Biphosphinic Paladacycle Complex (BPC11) and possible cross talk between apoptosis and autophagy in cell line models of metastatic (Tm5) and non-metastatic (4C11-) melanoma. The BPC11-induced cell death in melanoma involved the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis, which is characterized by LMP, CatB activation and increased Bax protein levels following its translocation to mitochondria. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization, followed by membrane potential dissipation and cleavage of caspase-3, also resulted in cell death after 24Â h of incubation. We also found that BPC11-mediated LC3II formation and increased p62 protein levels, suggesting blocked autophagy, probably due to LMP. Interestingly, the treatment of Tm5 and 4C11(-) cells with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor of the initial stage of autophagy, potentiated the effects of BPC11. We conclude that BPC11 is an anti-melanoma agent and that autophagy may be acting as a mechanism of melanoma cells resistance. Also, these data highlight the importance of studies involving autophagy and apoptosis during pre-clinical studies of new drugs with anticancer properties. ",

The ClAlPc nanocapsules were characterized by particle size and distribution, zeta potential, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, singlet oxygen production, stability, and phototoxic action on melanoma cells. Both the development and optimization studies revealed that stable colloidal formulations could be obtained by using 1.75% (w/v) soybean lecithin, 1.25% (w/v) Poloxamer 188, 2.5% (v/v) soybean oil, and 0.75% (w/v) poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide). The nanocapsules had a mean diameter of 230 nm, homogeneous size distribution (polydispersity index<0.3), and negative zeta potential (about -30 mV). Their morphology was spherical, with evident polymer membrane coating droplet. The encapsulation efficiency was 70%, as expected for hydrophobic drugs, and the nanoencapsulated ClAlPc was able to produce high singlet oxygen quantum yield. ClAlPc nanocapsules exhibited good physical stability over a 12-month period. WM1552C primary melanoma cells were more sensitive (p<0.05) to the phototoxic effect elicited by ClAlPc nanocapsules (0.3 Î¼g ml(-1)) under light irradiation at 20 mJ cm(-2). On the other hand, the cell survival percentage for all the melanoma cell lines treated with the highest light dose (150 mJ cm(-2)) was lower than 10%.

Melanosomal glycoproteins are transported to melanosomes by a dileucine-based melanosomal transport signal (MTS). To investigate whether this sorting signal could be involved in presentation of melanosome membrane proteins to the immune system, we devised a fusion construct containing the MTS from the mouse brown locus product gp75/tyrosinase-related protein-1 and full-length OVA as a reporter Ag. The fusion protein was expressed as an intracellular membrane protein, sorted to the endocytic pathway, processed, and presented by class II MHC molecules. DNA immunization with this construct elicited CD4+ T cell proliferative responses in vivo. Ag presentation and T cell responses in vitro and in vivo required a functional MTS. Mutations of either the upstream leucine in MTS or elimination of the entire MTS negated in vitro Ag presentation and in vivo T cell responses. In a mouse melanoma model, DNA immunization with MTS constructs protected mice from tumor challenge in a CD4+ T cell-dependent manner, but complete deletion of MTS decreased tumor rejection. Therefore, MTS can target epitopes to the endocytic pathway leading to presentation by class II MHC molecules to helper T cells.",

Here we used human melanoma cell line mS and two variants selected from mS population: a) MDR variant of mS selected by colchicine (mS-0.5) and b) mS-trRAR/2--variant obtained by introduction of expressing retinoic acid receptor RAR-alpha cDNA into mS cell. The differentiation status, expression of MDR1 gene and Pgp functioning were compared in wild-type cells and mS variants. Electron microscopic examination of melanosomes showed that the mS-0.5 subline comprised more differentiating cells in the population than parental mS cultures and that these cells were at later stages of melanogenesis. The increase in the degree of differentiation in mS-0.5 population coincided with MDR1 gene overexpression, occurrence of Pgp molecules on the cell membrane and acceleration of Pgp-mediated Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux. mS-trRAR/2, proved to be more differentiated than mS cells. The MDR1 mRNA level and Rh123 efflux were not elevated in mS-trRAR/2 cells, however, retinoic acid (RA) treatment increased both the degree of differentiation and Rh123 efflux in mS-trRAR/2 to a greater extent than in mS cultures.

MART-1(26-35)-specific CD8 T cell clones, which differed in their trogocytosis capacity (low [2D11], intermediate [2G1], high [2E2]), were generated from melanoma patients. Functional evaluation of the clones showed that the percentage of trogocytosis-capable T cells closely paralleled each clone's IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± production, lysosome degranulation, and lysis of peptide-pulsed targets and unmodified melanoma. The highly cytotoxic 2E2 clone displayed the highest TCR peptide binding affinity, whereas the low-activity 2D11 clone showed TCR binding to peptide-MHC in a CD8-dependent manner. TCR analysis revealed VÎ²16 for clones 2E2 and 2G1 and VÎ²14 for 2D11. When peptide-affinity differences were bypassed by nonspecific TCR stimulation, clones 2E2 and 2D11 still manifested distinctive signaling patterns. The high-activity 2E2 clone displayed prolonged phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, an integrator of MAPK and AKT activation, whereas the low-activity 2D11 clone generated shorter and weaker phosphorylation. Screening the two clones with identical TCR VÎ² by immunoreceptor array showed higher phosphorylation of NK, T, and B cell Ag (NTB-A), a SLAM family homophilic receptor, in clone 2E2 compared with 2G1. Specific blocking of NTB-A on APCs markedly reduced cytokine production by CD8 lymphocytes, pointing to a possible contribution of NTB-A costimulation to T cell functional diversity.

These AL contained 80% (73%-93%) monocytes, 15% (6%-20%) B lymphocytes and 5% (1%-8%) T lymphocytes. The survival of these tumor cells against the stress exerted by these AL was estimated with a clonogenic assay where isolated tumor cells were co-cultured for 14 days in contact with AL and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). For a given blood donor, AL either stimulates or inhibits the colony formation of the tumor cells (T) depending on the AL/T ratio, the AL activation status and the metastatic potential of tumor cells. At low AL/T ratios (< 10/1) in the presence of low (8 ng/ml) and trace (8 pg/ml) levels of LPS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release is significantly reduced, and tumor cells significantly increase their colony formation; the feeder effect of AL is suggested to be due to low concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). At high AL/T ratios (> 10/1), whatever the characteristics of the blood donor, clone 4 is significantly more sensitive than M4Be to AL activated with medium containing low (8 ng/ml) or high (1,000 ng/ml) levels of LPS; this killing effect is suggested to be due to TNF-alpha, both soluble and membrane-bound, but not to be due to release of H2O2. These data suggest that the regulatory role of AL, which remove the majority of human melanoma cells and stimulate the colony formation of a small fraction of them, is partly due to TNF-alpha.",

Using specific antibodies, we identified Gi2 as the PT-sensitive G-protein uniquely abundant in highly metastatic cells. ADP ribosylation of a G-protein alpha subunit by PT decreased both the migration of tumor cells through Matrigel (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) and the fibronectin-, laminin-, and collagen type IV-mediated motility of a high metastatic clone. Treatment of cells from a low metastatic clone with PT did not alter either the relatively low invasive capacity or lower motility of these cells. While cholera toxin treatment of cells resulted in decreased invasion and motility of both high and low metastatic clones, there were significant qualitative and quantitative differences, when compared to the PT effects, which indicated that the two toxins were acting on different second messenger systems. PT treatment of B16 clones of high or low experimental metastatic capacity does not result in any alteration in cellular cyclic AMP accumulation suggesting that the PT substrate is not linked with the adenylyl cyclase enzyme complex. The data suggest that a PT-sensitive G-protein, possibly Gi2, regulates second messenger pathways that contribute to the metastatic capacity of B16 melanoma cells.",

Reactivity of the chimpanzee antiserum for the 250 Kd TAA was confirmed in blocking and reciprocal immunodepletion studies using murine monoclonal antibody 9.2.27.

MCSP has therefore been frequently selected as target antigen for development of antibody- and vaccine-based therapeutic approaches. We have here used a large panel of monoclonal antibodies against human MCSP for generation of single-chain MCSP/CD3-bispecific antibodies of the BiTE (for bispecific T cell engager) class. Despite similar binding affinity to MCSP, respective BiTE antibodies greatly differed in their potency of redirected lysis of CHO cells stably transfected with full-length human MCSP, or with various MCSP deletion mutants and fusion proteins. BiTE antibodies binding to the membrane proximal domain D3 of MCSP were more potent than those binding to more distal domains. This epitope distance effect was corroborated with EpCAM/CD3-bispecific BiTE antibody MT110 by testing various fusion proteins between MCSP and EpCAM as surface antigens. CHO cells expressing small surface target antigens were generally better lysed than those expressing larger target antigens, indicating that antigen size was also an important determinant for the potency of BiTE antibody. The present study for the first time relates the positioning of binding domains and size of surface antigens to the potency of target cell lysis by BiTE-redirected cytotoxic T cells. In case of the MCSP antigen, this provides the basis for selection of a maximally potent BiTE antibody candidate for development of a novel melanoma therapy.",

Therefore, the present study has investigated the ability of beta2-mu-free HLA class I heavy chains to modulate NK cell-mediated lysis of melanoma cells and to present melanoma-associated antigen (MAA)-derived peptides to HLA class I-restricted, MAA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Beta2-mu-free HLA class I heavy chains were induced on beta2m null FO-1 cells by sequential incubation with IFN-alpha for 48 h at 37 degrees C and for 24 h at 26 degrees C. Transfection of cells with a wild-type H-2Ld gene (FO-1Ld) enhanced the induction of beta2-mu-free HLA class I heavy chains under such experimental conditions. Beta2-mu-free HLA class I heavy chains expressed on the cell membrane did not protect the B2m null FO-1 cells from NK cell-mediated lysis. Furthermore, FO-1 cells which express beta2-mu-free HLA-A2 heavy chains following transfection with a wild-type HLA-A2 gene were not lysed by HLA-A2-restricted, MAA-specific CTL lines and clones.

        "Doc_abstract":"A key event in cancer metastasis is the transendothelial migration of tumor cells. This process involves multiple adhesive interactions between tumor cells and the endothelium. After adhering to the surface of endothelial cells, tumor cells must penetrate the endothelial junction, which contains high concentrations of the cell adhesion molecules VE-cadherin and PECAM-1. Studies using an in vitro model system, consisting of melanoma cells which are seeded onto a monolayer of endothelial cells cultured on Matrigel, have revealed reorganization of the cytoskeleton and dynamic changes in the cell shape of both tumor and endothelial cells. The initial stages of transmigration are characterized by numerous membrane blebs protruding from the basolateral surfaces of the melanoma cells. Contact regions also show an abundance of microfilaments arising from the underlying endothelial cells. These adhesive interactions lead to the redistribution of both VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 and, consequently, a localized dissolution of the endothelial junction. The penetration of the endothelial junction is initiated by melanoma pseudopods. Despite the disappearance of VE-cadherin from the retracting endothelial junction, heterotypic contacts between the tumor cell and its surrounding endothelial cells show a high concentration of pan-cadherin staining, suggesting that transmigration of melanoma cells might yet be facilitated by interactions with another member of the cadherin family. Upon adhesion to the Matrigel, melanoma cells begin to spread and invade the matrix material, while the endothelial cells extend processes over the melanoma cells to reform the monolayer. Interestingly, the leading margins of these endothelial processes contain a high concentration ofN-cadherin. VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 reappear only when the advancing endothelial processes meet to reform the endothelial junction. Together, these observations suggest that endothelial cells actively participate in the transmigration of tumor cells and specific cadherins are involved in different steps of this complex process.",

However, the mechanism(s) involved remains less understood. Here, we report that combinations of HDAC and BRAF inhibitors kill BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells by induction of necrosis. Cotreatment with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or panobinostat (LBH589) and the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 activated the caspase cascade, but caspases appeared dispensable for killing, in that inhibition of caspases did not invariably block induction of cell death. The majority of dying cells acquired propidium iodide positivity instantly when they became positive for Annexin V, suggesting induction of necrosis. This was supported by caspase-independent release of high-mobility group protein B1, and further consolidated by rupture of the plasma membrane and loss of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, as manifested by transmission electron microscopic analysis. Of note, neither the necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 nor the small interference RNA (siRNA) knockdown of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) inhibited cell death, suggesting that RIPK1 and RIPK3 do not contribute to induction of necrosis by combinations of HDAC and BRAF inhibitors in BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells. Significantly, SAHA and the clinically available BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib cooperatively inhibited BRAF(V600E) melanoma xenograft growth in a mouse model even when caspase-3 was inhibited. Taken together, these results indicate that cotreatment with HDAC and BRAF inhibitors can bypass canonical cell death pathways to kill melanoma cells, which may be of therapeutic advantage in the treatment of melanoma.",

CD61 or beta3 integrin also associates with alpha v (CD51) to form the vitronectin receptor, which is expressed in many tissues. We have used a monoclonal antibody against the porcine gpIIIa or CD61 (JM2E5) to study the distribution of this molecule in different normal pig tissues. As in humans, CD61 was broadly expressed in all tissues examined. In the kidney, strong expression of CD61 was observed in epithelial cells from renal tubules. In the testis, CD61 expression was detected in the Leydig cells. However, in liver, CD61 was weak or not detected. Many integrins are particularly involved in tumogenicity and in tumor progression mediating cell-cell interaction. Immunofluorescence experiments using cultured human tumor HeLa cells showed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of mAb JM2E5. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tumor sections from several organs showed a heterogeneus distribution in metastatic cases from colon and breast carcinoma. However, no staining was found in metastasis from melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Simultaneous occurrence of resistance to many chemotherapeutic agents, termed multidrug resistance (MDR), is a complex phenotype. MDR occurs due to several reasons, including over-expression of a 170-kDa membrane-bound protein, called P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which apparently participates in active drug efflux. Multidrug-resistant cells also frequently exhibit an altered pattern of intracellular drug distribution, resulting in a reduction in the nuclear level of drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX). In this study, the effect of dipyridamole (DP) on drug resistance and on intracellular as well as nuclear levels of DOX in multidrug-resistant melanoma cells has been examined. For this purpose, drug-sensitive murine melanoma cells (B16V) and their multidrug-resistant variant cells, (B16VDXR; selected for resistance to DOX) which over-produce P-gp, were employed. B16VDXR cells were cross-resistant to several anti-cancer agents including etoposide (VP-16) and mitoxantrone (Mitox). DP (10 microM) significantly potentiated the cytotoxicity of DOX, VP-16 and Mitox towards multidrug-resistant B16VDXR cells but not in parental drug-sensitive B16V cells. The presence of DP resulted in a 3.7-fold increase in the total cellular level and a 4.2-fold increase in the nuclear content of DOX in the resistant cells. Isobologram analysis indicates that DP at several pharmacologically relevant concentrations synergistically potentiates the activity of DOX in B16VDXR cells.",

Sialyltransferases (GM3, GD3, GD1a, and GT1b synthases), N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GM2 and GD2 synthases), and galactosyltransferase (GM1 and GD1b synthases) were analyzed in crude membrane preparations from these cells. The results confirmed the importance of GM3 and GD3 synthases in determining the prominence of the a (GM3 to GT1a) or b (GD3 to GQ1b) biosynthetic pathways. The overall ganglioside composition in cells was found to be dependent on the relative levels of specific enzymes acting sequentially or in competing pathways. In general, the pattern and levels of transferases correlated with the actual ganglioside content of the cell line, although several important discrepancies were noted. For example, in cell lines containing high amounts of GD2 ganglioside, the level of the preceding enzyme in the pathway (GD3 synthase) was unexpectedly low. Thus, the high GD2:GD3 ratios characteristic of most neuroblastomas result from low levels of GD3 synthase as well as high levels of GD2 synthase. In other cell lines, GD3 synthase was completely absent, resulting in the synthesis of GM2, but not GD2, by N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase I, as would be expected. It was concluded that different glycosyltransferases play key roles in determining glycolipid expression in different cell types.",

Phagocytic cells were removed prior to testing. Specific rabbit antisera and monoclonal antibodies to purified human B cell DR and Fc molecules were used for detection of membrane immunofluorescence. Mild declines of total lymphocytes and of E-rosetting T cells were observed in comparing early to late disease. The drop of Ig(+) B cells was more striking. DR(+) cells, however, showed no change in percentage and a lesser drop in absolute numbers, suggesting an increase with advancing disease of DR(+), Ig(-) null cells, which may represent immature B cell precursors. Fc(+) cells increased markedly in 14 patients who received levamisole, with little effect on the markers. Elevations of OKT4/OKT8 ratios were seen with a relative reduction in OKT8 cells, especially in late disease. These changes in lymphocyte subpopulations may reflect imbalance between the B and T arms from deranged immune regulation caused by chronic antigenic stimulation from progressively growing tumor.

The combination of these two core pharmacophores with modification in the C-8 position of the PBD ring with alkyl spacers afforded oxygen-tethered compounds 5a-5d and amide-tethered analogues 11a-11d with improved anticancer activity for two melanoma cell lines, A375 and RPMI7951, differing in their p53 status. The agents 5a-5d were cytotoxic in melanoma compared to agents 11a-11d. In particular, compounds 5b and 5c were found to possess the most potent activity compared with other hybrid agents and were proved with the help of quantitative structure activity relationship studies (QSAR). These PBD conjugates caused S phase arrest for the A375Â cell line via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM-Rad3-related (ATR) and checkpoint kinases 1 (Chk1) activation. Moreover, the PBD-GA induced A375 apoptotic cell death followed through p53 (ATM downstream target) increase, B-cell leukemia-xL (Bcl-xL) and mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨mt) decrease, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3/Poly Adp Ribose Polymerase (PARP) cleavage. On the other hand, mutant p53 RPMI7951Â cell death occurred by PBD-GA-mediated mitochondria- and caspase-dependent pathways via lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), but not through p53 signaling. Finally, compound 5b was shown to reduce murine melanoma size in a mouse model. These results suggest that the PBD-GA could be used as a useful chemotherapeutic agent in melanoma with activated p53 or mutant p53. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recently, we have shown that plasminogen activators (PAs) of both types, urokinase-type (uPA) as well as tissue-type (tPA), are involved in the in vitro invasiveness of human melanoma cells. The present study is focused on the generation and importance of cell surface-bound plasmin in this process. The human melanoma cell lines MelJuso and MeWo expressed plasminogen binding sites on the cell surface. Plasminogen binding was saturable and not species-specific, since human and bovine plasminogen bound to the cells with comparable efficiency. The activation of the proenzyme plasminogen bound on MelJuso cells, which expressed surface-associated uPA activity, occurred almost synchronously with binding to the cell surface. Removal of cell-associated uPA considerably reduced plasmin generation on these cells. In contrast, plasminogen activation on MeWo cells, which secreted tPA into the culture supernatant and which were devoid of surface-associated PA activity, was by far less effective. The efficiency of the activation process could be increased by addition of exogenous tPA. With both cell lines, plasmin generation on the cell surface was suppressed by inhibitory monoclonal antibodies specific for the respective PA type. Selective inhibition of cell surface-associated plasmin by preincubating the cells with an inhibitory monoclonal antibody or with aprotinin, as well as removal of plasmin from the cell surface, led to a significant decrease in cellular invasiveness of both cell lines into various biological substrates such as fibrin gel, the basement membrane extract Matrigel, or intact extracellular matrix. Both cell lines were able to penetrate an intact cell layer of the human keratinocyte line HaCaT, a process, which also proved to be dependent on cell-associated plasmin. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that plasminogen activation associated with the surface of human melanoma cells is catalyzed much more efficiently by cell-associated uPA (MelJuso) than by secreted tPA (MeWo). Cell-associated plasmin, which is protected from inactivation by serum inhibitors, represents the essential component of the proteolytic cascade of plasminogen activation during in vitro invasiveness of human melanoma cells.",

Conversely, the antiproliferative responses of IFN-alpha in sensitive human melanoma cells are accompanied by 1-8U induction.

However, 6-O- and N-sulfated but partially N-deacetylated chitin derivative (SCM-chitosan) and CM-chitin had no effect. SCM-chitin with a high degree of sulfation (SCM-chitin III), which exhibited fairly low levels of anticoagulant activity, was more effective than intact heparin. SCM-chitin III and heparin were also shown to block the attachment and migration of tumor cells to laminin-coated substrates, which are considered to be involved in tumor invasion. The inhibition of cell attachment and migration by SCM-chitin III and heparin is likely to depend upon their specific binding to laminin molecules (possibly the heparin-binding domain). Degradation of heparan sulfate by heparanase was inhibited by SCM-chitin III and heparin in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, SCM-chitin III could inhibit type IV collagenolytic activity of tumor cells more potently than heparin.

In fact, c-Met constitutive activation is suddenly lost upon detachment of the cells from the substrate and is dramatically decreased in adherent cells plated at low density. The loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met in suspension appears to depend, at least partly, on an increased cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity. Instead, lower activation of c-Met at low density mostly results from a decrease in receptor concentration on the membrane. Moreover, we show that c-Met activation does not occur homogeneously on the surface of adherent cells. In fact, receptor concentration and activation appear to be higher on the ventral surface (adherent to the substrate) than on the apical surface. Upon detachment, compartmentalization is lost, leading to a decrease in average receptor density on the plasma membrane and hence to a lower activation.",

Recently a panel of HS-epitope-specific, human single chain antibodies have been generated by phage display, facilitating analysis of the structural heterogeneity of HS in relation to pathological conditions. In a pilot study a heterogeneous staining pattern in melanoma metastases was observed with one of the clones (EW4G1). Using a double-staining technique, the expression of this epitope was studied in 12 metastatic melanoma lesions in relation to the presence of a CD3(+) cell infiltrate. Different staining patterns with EW4G1 were observed in the different lesions. The different staining patterns were associated with the presence and pattern of inflammation with CD3(+) cells. A pronounced staining pattern of blood vessels with EW4G1 was associated with a more or less brisk presence of CD3(+) cells, while a pronounced staining of tumour cells or tumour cell matrix or absence of staining with EW4G1 was associated with absence of CD3(+) cells. These results suggest a dualistic role for HS in the recruitment and intratumoural migration of CD3(+) cells, depending on the location of expression of its epitope recognized by EW4G1. Further characterization of the structural diversity of HS and its function in T-cell recruitment and migration is therefore warranted, since detailed understanding of this relation may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention, such that better homing and migration of T cells (in)to tumours might be achieved in immunologically based treatment strategies.",

Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer that is commonly fatal if not diagnosed in its early stage of development. Melanoma is resistant to many treatments, thus drastically limiting chemotherapy options for this cancer. We have shown that exposure to PST induces apoptosis in human melanoma within 72 h using Hoechst staining. Interestingly tamoxifen (TAM), an estrogen receptor antagonist, sensitizes these cells to apoptosis induction by PST as observed with Hoechst and annexin-V staining. This cotreatment did not affect the viability of normal noncancerous human fibroblasts. Both of these compounds have been shown to target the mitochondria synergistically, as indicated by higher levels of reactive oxygen species generation from isolated mitochondria. PST alone and in combination with TAM shows depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential as shown by JC-1 staining. Melanoma drug resistance was not observed after posttreatment recuperation, as cells displayed apoptotic morphology up to 96 h after drug-free media replacement. Our results indicate that TAM alone does not induce apoptosis in this cell line, but sensitizes the mitochondria, thereby enhancing the effect of PST exposure. In conclusion, combination of two nongenotoxic compounds offers a novel treatment regime for this notoriously resilient form of skin cancer. ",

Cell deformability was measured as the percentage of cells traversing 10-mum diameter Nuclepore filter membranes at constant pressure as a function of time. A method was devised to circumvent common problems encountered in cell filtration experiments, i.e., cell aggregation and adhesion to the filter and failure to recover the input. F1a cells with the lowest spontaneous metastatic rate required 44 s for 50% of the cell input to traverse the filter, whereas No. 4 cells, featuring the highest metastatic rate, needed 12 s despite the fact that the cells had identical dimensions. Other variants tested showed intermediate filterability which also correlated with their metastatic potential. Cells, when pretreated with cytochalasin B at a final concentration of 21 microM exhibited increased filterability (75% and 42% greater than control for F1a and No. 4 cells, respectively). Somewhat smaller increases were observed after colchicine treatment. The findings imply major involvement of the cytoskeleton in the filterability and thus deformability of these B16 variants.

In vitro cytotoxicity of doxorubicin encapsulated in liposomes was enhanced by antibody coupling, but still behind free doxorubicin. However, in vivo antitumor therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin encapsulated in the immunoliposomes was far greater than the free drug or in conventional liposomes.

Clinically, TRPM1 is used as a predictor of melanoma progression in humans because of its reduced abundance in more aggressive forms of melanoma. Although TRPM1 is found primarily in melanin-producing cells and has the molecular architecture of an ion channel, its function is unknown. Here we describe an endogenous current in primary human neonatal epidermal melanocytes and mouse melanoma cells that was abrogated by expression of microRNA directed against TRPM1. Messenger RNA analysis showed that at least five human ion channel-forming isoforms of TRPM1 could be present in melanocytes, melanoma, brain, and retina. Two of these isoforms are encoded by highly conserved splice variants that are generated by previously uncharacterized exons. Expression of these two splice variants in human melanoma cells generated an ionic current similar to endogenous TRPM1 current. In melanoma cells, TRPM1 is prevalent in highly dynamic intracellular vesicular structures. Plasma membrane TRPM1 currents are small, raising the possibility that their primary function is intracellular, or restricted to specific regions of the plasma membrane. In neonatal human epidermal melanocytes, TRPM1 expression correlates with melanin content. We propose that TRPM1 is an ion channel whose function is critical to normal melanocyte pigmentation and is thus a potential target for pigmentation disorders.",

In order to evaluate if the alteration of the antioxidants could be the basis of an increased sensitivity to exposure to peroxidative agents, in cultured melanocytes from normal individuals (n = 11) and from patients with melanoma (n = 11), superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were evaluated by spectrophotometer, and the levels of vitamin E and of the polyunsaturated fatty acid of cell membranes were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. In 5 out of the 11 cultures of melanocytes from melanoma patients, with respect to those from normal individuals, a significant decrease of catalase activity (Cat) associated with an increase of vitamin E (Vit E) concentration was found, whereas no significant modification of superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) was observed. A wide range of variability was detected in the percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the cell membranes and a correlation was found between the ratio SOD/Cat and the percentage of linoleic acid, indicating that the imbalance of the enzymatic antioxidants leads to a lipoperoxidative process. The electron microscopic examination of these cultures revealed many microvilli in the plasma membranes and nuclear infoldings and in the cytoplasm light vacuoles. Moreover some cells contained several dense bodies with a round shape and numerous spherical lamellae possibly representing immature melanosomes. Treatment with cumene hydroperoxide between 0.66 and 20 microM did not produce a significant modification of cell viability in melanocytes from normal individuals. On the contrary in melanocytes from melanoma patients correlated with the ratio Vit E/Cat, considered as a parameter of the antioxidant imbalance, a stimulatory effect was observed at 0.66 microM CUH and a cytotoxic effect at 20 microM.

We have recently shown that erythrocytes containing P. falciparum trophozoites and schizonts likewise attach to cultured human venous endothelial cells via knobs. In search of a more practical target cell for large scale binding studies designed to characterize and isolate the knob ligand, we tested various normal cells and continuous cell lines for their ability to bind P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Of the 18 cell types tested, binding of infected erythrocytes was observed to a human amelanotic melanoma cell line and amnion epithelial cells as well as to human aortic and umbilical vein endothelial cells. 96-100% of amelanotic melanoma cells bound 17+/-4 (+/-1 SEM) infected erythrocytes per positive cell, whereas fewer endothelial cells (4-59%) and amnion epithelial cells (8-19%) were capable of binding 12+/-5 and 4+/-1 infected erythrocytes per positive cell, respectively. Further studies designed to compare the mechanism of binding to the amelanotic melanoma cell line and endothelial cells showed the following results. First, that adhesion of infected erythrocytes to these two cell types was parasite stage-specific in that only erythrocytes containing late ring forms, trophozoites, and schizonts bound. Erythrocytes containing early ring forms, which do not attach to venular endothelium in vivo, did not bind to either cell type. Second, erythrocytes infected with trophozoites and schizonts of P. vivax or a knobless strain of P. falciparum, both of which continue to circulate in vivo, did not bind to either target cell type. Third, transmission electron microscopy showed that infected erythrocytes attached to the amelanotic melanoma cells via knobs. We conclude that cultured human endothelial cells and an amelanotic melanoma cell line share common determinants on their surface and that the mechanism of binding to these two different cell types is similar. The amelanotic melanoma cell line offers a useful substitute for endothelial cells in binding studies requiring large numbers of target cells.",

The present study aims to investigate the anti-cancer effect of Centratherum anthelminticum (L.) seeds chloroform fraction (CACF) on human melanoma cells and to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved.;A chloroform fraction was extracted from C. anthelminticum (CACF). Bioactive compounds of the CACF were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Human melanoma cell line A375 was treated with CACF in vitro. Effects of CACF on growth inhibition, morphology, stress and survival of the cell were examined with MTT, high content screening (HSC) array scan and flow cytometry analyses. Involvement of intrinsic or extrinsic pathways in the CACF-induced A375 cell death mechanism was examined using a caspase luminescence assay. The results were further verified with different caspase inhibitors. In addition, Western blot analysis was performed to elucidate the changes in apoptosis-associated molecules. Finally, the effect of CACF on the NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation ability was assayed.;The MTT assay showed that CACF dose-dependently inhibited cell growth of A375, while exerted less cytotoxic effect on normal primary epithelial melanocytes. We demonstrated that CACF induced cell growth inhibition through apoptosis, as evidenced by cell shrinkage, increased annexin V staining and formation of membrane blebs. CACF treatment also resulted in higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lower Bcl-2 expression, leading to decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Disruption of the MMP facilitated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which activates caspase-9 and downstream caspase-3/7, resulting in DNA fragmentation and up-regulation of p53 in melanoma cells. Moreover, CACF prevented TNF-Î±-induced NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation, which further committed A375 cells toward apoptosis.;Together, our findings suggest CACF as a potential therapeutic agent against human melanoma malignancy.",

In parallel, binding and release of MAbs were investigated by the radioantibody binding assay (RBA). Both procedures gave essentially concordant results. Preferentially stable binding of immune complexes (ICs) to the cell surface after 30 and 120 min was shown for the MAb L10. Internalization was demonstrated for the MAb M.2.9.4. At the ultrastructural level, direct evidence of this phenomenon was obtained by visualization of radioactivity within the cytoplasm after 120 min. In the RBA this process was indicated by resistance of bound MAbs to acid buffer desorption. RIEM pointed to different transport mechanisms: constitutive internalization by endocytotic vesicles, or receptor-mediated endocytosis by coated vesicles. Shedding was indicated for the MAb R24 by release of the ICs from the cell membrane. It was demonstrated that stable fixation of ICs on the cell surface or modulation by internalization led to high accumulation rates, while shedding of antigen-antibody complexes resulted in a low accumulation of the MAb in tumor cells. Assuming that the potential of MAbs for clinical application is determined by the biological behavior of antigen-antibody complexes, these methods are suitable for demonstration of antigenic modulation by MAbs and eventually enable us to predict the localization, penetration and distribution pattern of individual MAbs in the melanoma patient.",

Upon maturation, these cell types down-regulate NG2 expression. In adult animals, the expression of NG2 is restricted to tumor cells and angiogenic tumor vasculature, making this proteoglycan a potential target for directing therapeutic agents to relevant sites of action. To this end, we have identified specific NG2-binding peptides by screening a phage-displayed random peptide library on purified NG2. Several rounds of biopanning on NG2 resulted in the specific enrichment of two phage-displayed decapeptides, TAASGVRSMH and LTLRWVGLMS. The binding of these phages to NG2 was inhibitable both by soluble NG2 and by glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the cognate peptide sequences. In addition, direct binding between GST-TAASGVRSMH and GST-LTLRWVGLMS fusion proteins and NG2 was demonstrated in solid-phase binding assays. Interestingly, these NG2-binding fusion proteins cross-inhibited each other's binding to NG2, suggesting that the two sequences bind to the same or overlapping sites on the proteoglycan.

In an in vitro analysis, both saponin preparations showed a significant inhibition of adhesion to fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LM) by B16-BL6 melanoma. Similarly, they significantly inhibited the invasion of B16-BL6 cells into the reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel)/FN in a dose-dependent manner. In an experimental metastasis model using B16-BL6 melanoma, consecutive intravenous (i.v.) administrations of 100 micrograms/mouse of 20(R)- or 20(S)-ginsenoside-Rg3 1, 2, 3 and 4 d after tumor inoculation led to a significant decrease in lung metastasis. The inhibitory effect of i.v. administration of both ginseng saponins on the tumor metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma was also recognized in a low dose of 10 micrograms/mouse. The oral administration (p.o.) of both saponins (100-1000 micrograms/mouse) induced a significant decrease in lung metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma. Moreover, both ginseng saponins were effective in inhibiting of lung metastasis produced by colon 26-M3.1 carcinoma. When 20(R)- or 20(S)-ginsenoside-Rg3 was orally administered consecutively after tumor inoculation in a spontaneous metastasis model using B16-BL6 melanoma, both of them significantly inhibited lung metastasis. In the experiment involving neovasculization by tumor cells in vivo, both mice groups given each saponin preparation after tumor inoculation exhibited a significant decrease in the number of blood vessels oriented toward the tumor mass, with no repression of tumor size. These findings suggest that both ginseng saponins, 20(R)- and 20(S)-ginsenoside-Rg3, possess an ability to inhibit the lung metastasis of tumor cells, and the mechanism of their antimetastatic effect is related to inhibition of the adhesion and invasion of tumor cells, and also to anti-angiogenesis activity.",

E-cadherin expression was evaluated in 70 malignant melanomas and the catenins in 35 of these specimens. Twenty benign melanocytic naevi were also evaluated for E-cadherin and catenin expression. In normal epidermis, E-cadherin/catenin immunostaining was localized at the intercellular borders. In melanomas, a differential loss of E-cadherin expression was observed. Membranous E-cadherin staining was absent in dermal nests of melanomas in their radial growth phase and in Clark level II and III lesions, whereas it was present in a high proportion of melanomas in their vertical growth phase, in Clark level IV and V lesions and in metastasizing melanomas. In contrast, superficial compartments of naevi showed membranous E-cadherin immunoreactivity and junctional naevus cell nests displayed heterogeneous or diffuse cytoplasmic staining. Cytoplasmic alpha- and beta-catenin, but not gamma-catenin staining were detected in all benign and malignant lesions.

In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of apoptosis-related protein (APR)-2 to trigger cell death via mechanism mediated by both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [as evidenced by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+) release, the activation of both, inositol-requiring enzyme 1Î± (IRE1Î±) and calpain and cleavage of caspase-4] and mitochondrial dysregulation as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Cytochrome c release and cleavage of caspases-9 and -3, and poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP). Also, the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) 1, c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the transcription factors AP-1 and p53, and the induction of Bax expression were noted in APR-2-expressing cells. Both immune fluorescence staining and western blotting revealed the localization of APR-2 at ER and Bax protein at both mitochondria and ER. However, data of inhibitory experiments demonstrated that APR-2-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells is mediated by three parallel pathways: one of them IRE1/tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2/ASK1/JNK/Cyt.c/caspase-9/caspase-3/PARP) seems to be mitochondrial dependent, whereas, the other two pathways namely calpain/caspase-4/caspase-9/caspase-3/PARP and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase/ATF4/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)/Bim seem to be mitochondrial independent. In conclusion, our data provide insight into the molecular mechanism of APR-2-induced apoptosis and suggest APR-2 gene transfer as an alternative approach for the treatment of chemoresistance melanoma metastasis.",

Previously, we reported that GD3+ cells show stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), p130(Cas), and paxillin when treated with fetal calf serum than GD3- cells. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the signals mediated by the interaction between integrins and extracellular matrices (ECM) to clarify how GD3 enhances cell signals in the vicinity of the cell membrane. An adhesion assay with a real time cell electronic sensing system revealed that GD3+ cells had stronger adhesion to all extracellular matrices examined. In particular, GD3+ cells attached more strongly to collagen type I and type IV than controls. Correspondingly, they showed stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin during adhesion to collagen type I. In the floating pattern of detergent extracts, a high level of integrin beta1 was found in glycolipid-enriched microdomain (GEM)/rafts in GD3+ cells before adhesion, whereas a smaller amount of integrin beta1 was detected in the GEM/rafts of controls. Some phosphorylated forms of FAK as well as total FAK were found in GEM/rafts during cell adhesion only in GD3+ cells. Another signal consisting of integrin-linked kinase/Akt was also activated during adhesion more strongly in GD3+ cells than in controls. In double stained GD3+ cells, GD3 and integrin beta1 co-localized at the focal adhesion with a punctate pattern. All these results suggested that integrins assembled and formed a cluster in GEM/rafts, leading to the enhanced signaling and malignant properties under GD3 expression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"It has previously been shown that most of the B16F10 melanoma cells delivered to the mouse liver via the portal vein are rapidly killed in periportal zone 1 of the sinusoids. Few intact viable cells reach pericentral zone 3 of the sinusoids and of these, only a very small proportion leave the liver to colonize the lungs. The hypothesis has been advanced that one non-exclusive, potential mechanism for cancer-cell destruction in the liver is a result of the deformation of cancer cells when they enter vessels of smaller diameter than themselves. Where entry is associated with change in shape from spheroid to cylindrical, a mandatory increase in cancer-cell surface area occurs, which is first apparent and utilizes surface membrane excess (rugosity). If this increase is insufficient, a real increase occurs which, if in excess of approximately 4%, results in lethal surface membrane rupture. This hypothesis predicts that, under these circumstances, cancer-cell resistance to mechanical trauma is favored by small diameter and utilizable surface membrane excess. To test this hypothesis, the traffic of melanoma cells in the liver following portal-vein injection has been observed by confocal microscopy and image reconstruction. In accordance with the hypothesis, non-disrupted cells within the sinusoids have a smaller mean diameter than that of the original inoculum, and show evidence of utilization of surface membrane excess. The results indicate that deformation-associated trauma, suffered by cancer cells on entry and residence in the microvasculature, may well be an important factor contributing to metastatic inefficiency.",

The anti-angiogenic effect was dose-dependent ranging from 10 to 500 micrograms/mouse. In contrast, intra-tumoral or oral administration of ginsenoside-Rb2 caused a marked inhibition of both neovascularization and tumor growth. Ginsenoside-Rb2 did not affect the growth of rat lung endothelial (RLE) cells, B16-BL6 melanoma cells or various types of murine normal cells in vitro. The invasion of RLE cells into the reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel), which is considered to be an essential event in tumor neovascularization, was inhibited by ginsenoside-Rb2 in a concentration-dependent fashion, while ginsenoside-Rb2 did not inhibit the haptotactic migration of endothelial cells to fibronectin-substrate. Multiple administrations of ginsenoside-Rb2 after the intravenous inoculation of B16-BL6 melanoma cells resulted in a significant inhibition of lung metastasis as compared with the untreated control.

The initial sites for membrane-membrane recognition, contact and subsequent interaction are thought to be associated with dense membrane anionic sites. In the experiments reported here we determined that the distribution of cell-surface dense anionic sites, examined ultrastructurally with the use of cationised ferritin (CF), is correlated with tumour cell aggregation in vitro and/or production of pulmonary tumour colonies following intravenous (i.v.) injection into syngeneic recipients.",

Quercetin (Qu), the most widely consumed dietary bioflavonoid and well known inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling, has been reported to be chemopreventive in several forms of non-melanoma skin cancers. Here, we report that the treatment of ultraviolet (UV)-B-irradiated B16F10 melanoma cells with quercetin resulted in a dose dependent reduction in cell viability and increased apoptosis. The present study has brought out that the pro-apoptotic effects of quercetin in UVB-irradiated B16F10 cells are mediated through the elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, calcium homeostasis imbalance, modulation of anti-oxidant defence response and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨M). Promotion of UVB-induced cell death by quercetin was further revealed by cleavage of chromosomal DNA, caspase activation, poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and an increase in sub-G1 cells. Quercetin markedly attenuated MEK-ERK signalling, influenced PI3K/Akt pathway, and potentially enhanced the UVB-induced NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, combined UVB and quercetin treatment decreased the ratio of Bcl-2 to that of Bax, and upregulated the expression of Bim and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Overall, these results suggest the possibility of using quercetin in combination with UVB as a possible treatment option for melanoma in future. ",

Trophic factors such as the neurotrophins play an important role in tumor cell invasion into the CNS and in the survival of small numbers of malignant cells under stress conditions. Trophic factors promote BBB invasion by enhancing the production of basement membrane-degrading enzymes in neurotrophin-responsive cells. The expression of certain neurotrophin receptors on brain-metastasic neuroendocrine cells occurs in relation to their invasive and survival properties. For example, CNS-metastatic melanoma cells respond to particular neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-2) that can be secreted by normal cells within the CNS. In addition, a paracrine form of transferrin is important in CNS metastasis, and brain-metastatic cells respond to low levels of transferrin and express high levels of transferrin receptors. CNS-metastatic tumor cells can also produce autocrine factors and inhibitors that influence their growth, invasion and survival in the brain. Synthesis of paracrine factors and cytokines may influence the production of trophic factors by normal brain cells adjacent to tumor cells. Moreover, we found increased amounts of neurotrophins in brain tissue at the invasion front of human melanoma tumors in CNS biopsies. Thus the ability to form metastatic colonies in the CNS is dependent on tumor cell responses to trophic factors as well as autocrine and paracrine growth factors and probably other underdescribed factors.",

Although the product (melanin) has a mainly protective function in the skin, the process of melanogenesis represents a potential cellular hazard and is confined to special membrane-limited organelles (melanosomes) in a set of specialized dendritic cells (melanocytes) which synthesize the pigment and transfer it to recipient cells. Malignant melanocytes tend to exhibit up-regulated melanogenesis and defective melanosomes. These features suggest ways in which anti-melanoma therapy may be specifically targeted. Two general chemotherapeutic modalities are considered: 1 The 'Achilles heel' approach in which the generation of reactive quinones capable of leaking into the cytosolic compartment and causing structural and functional derangement is encouraged by the use of analogue substrates. 2 The 'Trojan horse' approach, in which a cytotoxic agent is selectively released by a tyrosinase-dependent mechanism.",

Semiquantitative analysis of PS in the outer leaflet of the cells revealed that the tumorigenic cells expressed 3-7-fold more PS than did the nontumorigenic NHEK. To determine whether enhanced PS expression on the tumor cells was responsible for their recognition by activated monocytes, NHEK were supplemented with exogenously supplied analogues of PS and phosphatidylcholine.

In the present study on tumor cell lines derived from glioblastoma, breast cancer, and melanoma, we estimated the frequency of fusion between tumor cells by establishing the fraction of cells with whole tumor-genome duplication in each cell line. Together with this, the capacity of the tumor cell lines to spread through a basement membrane scaffold was assessed, in order to test the hypothesis that pericellular proteolysis by enzymatic release in the spaces of intercellular contact could account for differences in the fusogenicity of tumor cells. The difference in invasiveness between the cell lines accounted for their specific amount of cells with tumor-genome duplication, which, depending on the cell line analyzed, ranged from 2% to 25% of the total cells.

In this study derivatives of a short cationic peptide derived from the human host defense peptide lactoferricin were optimized in their selective toxicity towards cancer cells. We proved that the target of these peptides is the negatively charged membrane lipid phosphatidylserine (PS), specifically exposed on the surface of cancer cells. We have studied the membrane interaction of three peptides namely LF11-322, its N-acyl derivative 6-methyloctanoyl-LF11-322 and its retro repeat derivative R(etro)-DIM-P-LF11-322 with liposomes mimicking cancerous and non-cancerous cell membranes composed of PS and phosphatidylcholine (PC), respectively. Calorimetric and permeability studies showed that N-acylation and even more the repeat derivative of LF11-322 leads to strongly improved interaction with the cancer mimic PS, whereas only the N-acyl derivative also slightly affects PC. Tryptophan fluorescence of selective peptide R-DIM-P-LF11-322 revealed specific peptide penetration into the PS membrane interface and circular dichroism showed change of its secondary structure by increase of proportion of Î²-sheets just in the presence of the cancer mimic. Data correlated with in vitro studies with cell lines of human melanomas, their metastases and melanocytes, revealing R-DIM-P-LF11-322 to exhibit strongly increased specificity for cancer cells. This indicates the need of high affinity to the target PS, a minimum length and net positive charge, an adequate but moderate hydrophobicity, and capability of adoption of a defined structure exclusively in presence of the target membrane for high antitumor activity.

It shares several histologic and ultrastructural features with malignant melanoma. Clear cell sarcoma occasionally may be confused with other tumors of soft tissue that have a predominantly epithelioid appearance, including epithelioid leiomyosarcoma, epithelioid neurofibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma. To assess the potential contribution of immunohistochemistry to this differential diagnosis, a panel of immunostains was applied to examples of each of these neoplasms. All six CCSs contained vimentin, and five were reactive with the melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody HMB-45. In addition, five CCSs expressed neuron-specific enolase, four cases displayed S100 protein, and four examples contained LN3 antigen. Synaptophysin and Leu-7 antigen were present in one case each. Cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, desmin, muscle-specific actin, and leukocyte common antigen were invariably absent. No other primary epithelioid neoplasm of soft tissue reacted with HMB-45. Clear cell sarcoma could be separated from epithelioid leiomyosarcoma by the presence of desmin and muscle-specific actin in the latter neoplasm. Similarly, both synovial sarcoma and epithelioid sarcoma differed from CCS by their expression of cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen.

The pretreatment of either tumor cells or Matrigel with bestatin, however, had little effect on the invasion of tumor cells. Since bestatin was found to inhibit amino-peptidase in addition to its immunomodulating activities, the inhibition of tumor invasion by bestatin is likely to be associated with the action as an enzyme inhibitor. Other aminopeptidase inhibitors, arphamenine B and amastatin A, could also inhibit tumor cell invasion into Matrigel. Bestatin inhibited hydrolyzing activities towards substrates of aminopeptidases in B16-BL6 melanoma cells. However, bestatin did not have any effect on the haptotactic migration and adhesion of tumor cells to the substrates.

We have manipulated the expression of cathepsin B in several tumor cell lines and measured their capacity to invade through a reconstituted extracellular (Matrigel) matrix. Transient expression of human cathepsin B in a poorly metastatic B16F1 murine melanoma variant produced a 3-5-fold increase in cathepsin B activity and a comparable increase in invasiveness. Stable antisense cathepsin B-expressing clones of the highly metastatic human melanoma A375M and prostate carcinoma PC3M cell lines produced 40-50% less cathepsin B than control cells and were proportionately less invasive. In contrast, manipulating cathepsin B levels had no effect on cell migration across an uncoated membrane. The anionic cathepsin B inhibitor (L-3-trans-propylcarbamoyloxirane-2-carbony)-L-isoleucyl-L-proline (CA-074), at a concentration of 1 microM, caused a nearly quantitative inhibition of extracellular cathepsin B but had no effect on Matrigel invasion. In contrast, the equally potent but less selective inhibitor, trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamino(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) inhibited invasion by 75%. Surprisingly, at a concentration of 10 microM, CA-074 slowly permeated the cells, causing an 80-95% inhibition of intracellular cathepsin B after 12 h, the duration of the invasion assay. The membrane-permeant cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074 methyl ester, and the higher concentration of CA-074 that inhibited intracellular cathepsin B both significantly reduced Matrigel invasion. Collectively, these results identify an intracellular role for cathepsin B in matrix degradation. They also indicate that caution should be exercised in assuming that CA-074 is unable to enter cells when it is used to inhibit biological processes of long duration.",

A group of 28 morphometric parameters was derived to describe quantitatively each neoplastic cell profile. No qualitative difference was observed between the two cell lines. The quantitative expression of subcellular organelles was dissimilar in the two sublines, being consistently characterized, both in in-vitro cultured cells and in lung-metastatic colonies, by a significant decrease in the mean values of parameters related to melanosomes in the high metastatic capacity cell line (B16-F10). Moreover, in in-vitro cultured cells, indices describing heterochromatin masses and cytoplasmic membranous compartments displayed statistically significant differences between the two sublines. In this experimental system, an inverse relationship between metastatic capacity and differentiation is detected, since cells with a more aggressive metastatic behavior exhibit a decreased degree of differentiation.",

Recently, it was demonstrated that TM is also expressed on the surface of several tumor cells and the expression level of TM negatively correlated with malignancy in cancer. We investigated the effect of soluble TM isolated from human urine (uTM) on the invasion and metastasis of murine melanoma cells (B16F10 cells) through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) and in a murine model of experimental lung metastasis. Matrigel reconstituted with uTM inhibited the invasion of B16F10 cells in a dose-dependent manner in a range from 10 to 1000 ng/ml uTM as compared with the control Matrigel without uTM. The inhibitory action of uTM was not altered in the presence of an excess amount of hirudin, an inhibitor of thrombin proteolytic activity, but abolished in the presence of anti-human TM IgG. Matrigel reconstituted with thrombin (1 NIH unit/ml) enhanced the invasion level of cells by 1.5-fold relative to the control Matrigel without thrombin. The thrombin-enhanced invasion of B16F10 cells was repressed by addition of hirudin (10 units/ml) or uTM (100 ng/ml) into the Matrigel. Matrigel reconstituted with hirudin (10 units/ml) and uTM (100 ng/ml) additionally accelerated the inhibitory activity of hirudin or uTM on the thrombin-enhanced invasion of B16F10 cells. Moreover, metastatic colonies formed in the lungs of mice injected intravenously with B16F10 cells were significantly reduced by injection of uTM once a day up to 2 days after co-injection of uTM with the cells. These results suggested that Matrigel reconstituted with uTM inhibited the invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro through a thrombin-independent mechanism and the injection of uTM suppressed experimental lung metastasis of the cells in mice.",

When overexpressed, SMC exerts potent anti-adhesive effects, which sterically disrupt molecular interactions for cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesions. SMC similarly suppresses anti-tumor immunity by inhibition of interactions between cytotoxic lymphocytes and target tumor cells. Previously, recombinant cDNAs for SMC were transfected and inducibly expressed in A375 human melanoma cells using a tetracycline-responsive expression system. In the current studies, we investigated the role of MUC4/SMC in tumor metastasis by regulating SMC expression of tumor transplants in vivo. Intravenous injection of SMC-overexpressing cells resulted in substantially greater lung metastasis than injection of SMC-repressed cells. Injection of SMC-overexpressing cells followed by in vivo downregulation of SMC did not lower the frequency of lung metastasis. Growth of the micrometastatic lesions was the same for all 3 cases in short-term (3-week) assays. Further, subcutaneous injection of A375 cells followed by in vivo induction of SMC overexpression within the solid tumor resulted in spontaneous distant metastasis. These studies suggest that SMC potentiates metastasis by contributing to the establishment of metastatic foci. These studies directly demonstrate for the first time that tumor metastasis can be modulated by the regulation of MUC4/SMC expression.",

Membrane currents were recorded by the patch-clamp technique using the cell-attached, cell-free and whole-cell mode. Cell growth was monitored by counting the number of cells at different days after seeding and [3H]thymidine incorporation. 2. A voltage-dependent 10 pS non-inactivating potassium channel (delayed rectifier) is the most commonly observed ion channel in this type of human cell. The channel is active at the normal resting potential and can be blocked by tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) and also by a membrane-permeable cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, cyclic AMP). A second type of potassium channel shows properties similar to voltage-dependent A-type potassium channels with complete inactivation. 3. A voltage-independent, non-selective cation channel with a single-channel conductance of approximately 20 pS could be seen in only 8% of the patches. Its properties of modulation are still unknown. 4. The incidence of the 10 pS, non-inactivated potassium channel was maximal at the fourth day after seeding (in 89% of the patches) and was significantly reduced at the seventh day (in 35% of the patches). 5. [3H]thymidine incorporation is maximal at the third day after seeding and is reduced when cells are grown in the presence of TEA or cyclic AMP. This peak of maximal [3H]thymidine incorporation correlated with the incidence of non-inactivated potassium channels. 6. In the presence of TEA or cyclic AMP, growth of the cells is inhibited. We suppose that due to block of potassium channels, most of the melanoma cells are not able to enter the S-phase in the cell division cycle. 7. It is concluded that delayed rectifier potassium channels are involved in the control of melanoma cell proliferation. A similar finding has been reported for K+ channels in T-lymphocytes and human breast carcinoma cells. It is suggested that potassium channels may be involved in controlling the driving force for a calcium influx thereby interacting with Ca(2+)-dependent cell cycle control proteins.",

The SCV acquired early endosomal markers transiently and then underwent a series of membrane modifications. In HeLa cells, vacuole maturation is characterized by the simultaneous acquisition of the lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (Lgps) Lamp1, CD63 and vacuolar (v)-ATPase; in MelJuSo cells, however, acquisition of CD63 and v-ATPase preceded that of Lamp1. A very striking event in MelJuSo cells was the arrest of bacterial septation starting from 8 h after infection.

Here it is shown that partial knockdown of FLNa gene expression blocked ligand-induced EGFR responses in metastatic human melanomas. To gain greater insights into the role of FLNa in EGFR activation and intracellular sorting, we used M2 melanoma cells that lack endogenous FLNa and a subclone in which human FLNa cDNA has been stably reintroduced (M2A7 cells). Both tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination of EGFR were significantly lower in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated M2 cells when compared with M2A7 cells. Moreover, the lack of FLNa interfered with EGFR interaction with the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. M2 cells exhibited marked resistance to EGF-induced receptor degradation, which was very active in M2A7 cells. Despite comparable rates of EGF-mediated receptor endocytosis, internalized EGFR colocalized with the lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 in M2A7 cells but not M2 cells, in which EGFR was found to be sequestered in large vesicles and subsequently accumulated in punctated perinuclear structures after EGF stimulation.

In this paper, we report that STIM1- and Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) oscillations promote melanoma invasion by orchestrating invadopodium assembly and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Ca(2+) oscillation signals facilitate invadopodial precursor assembly by activating Src. Disruption of Ca(2+) oscillations inhibited invadopodium assembly. Furthermore, STIM1 and Orai1 regulate the proteolysis activity of individual invadopodia. Mechanistically, Orai1 blockade inhibited the recycling of MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) to the plasma membrane and entrapped MT1-MMP in the endocytic compartment to inhibit ECM degradation. STIM1 knockdown significantly inhibited melanoma lung metastasis in a xenograft mouse model, implicating the importance of this pathway in metastatic dissemination. Our findings provide a novel mechanism for Ca(2+)-mediated cancer cell invasion and shed new light on the spatiotemporal organization of store-operated Ca(2+) signals during melanoma invasion and metastasis.",

Similar to the other two melanogenic enzymes belonging to the TRP gene family, tyrosinase and TRP-1, TRP-2 is expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Despite the increasing evidence of its efficiency as a melanoma antigen, little is known about the maturation and intracellular trafficking of TRP-2. Here we show that TRP-2 is mainly distributed in the TGN of melanoma cells instead of being confined solely to melanosomes. This, together with the plasma membrane occasional localization observed by immunofluorescence, suggest the TRP-2 participation in a recycling pathway, which could include or not the melanosomes. Using pulse-chase experiments we show that the TRP-2 polypeptide folds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the presence of calnexin, until it reaches a dithiothreitol-resistant conformation enabling its ER exit to the Golgi. If N-glycosylation inhibitors prevent the association with calnexin, the TRP-2 nascent chain undergoes an accelerated degradation process. This process is delayed in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors, indicating that the misfolded chain is retro-translocated from the ER into the cytosol and degraded in proteasomes. This is a rare example in which calnexin although indispensable for the nascent chain folding is not required for its targeting to degradation. Therefore TRP-2 may prove to be a good model to document the calnexin-independent retro-translocation process of proteasomally degraded proteins. Clearly, TRP-2 has a distinct maturation pathway from tyrosinase and TRP-1 and possibly a second regulatory function within the cell.",

Biosynthesis and accumulation of PP in the melanoma cells was increased from 8 to 15 pmol/mg protein by the use of dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), a differentiation-inducer. Treatment of the cells with the porphyrogenic agent allylisopropyl-acetamide (AIA) stimulated an additional PP increase. The most remarkable enhancement of intracellular PP was achieved by the supplementation of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) to the growth medium following the addition of DMSO and AIA during the induction phase. The intracellular concentration of PP exceeded 21,950 pmol/mg protein following combined stimulation by DMSO/AIA and 5-ALA. The porphyrins produced in the incubated cells, in serum-depleted medium, consisted of 95% PP; 88% of it was recovered from the cells and only 7% was excreted into the medium. Photosensitization of the B16 melanoma cells containing high PP concentrations was effective even at low light doses. Potassium (K) efflux was the first measurable sign of cell damage determined by X-ray microanalysis (XRMA) following fast liquid-nitrogen fixation. During a 1 min interval, 70% of cellular K was lost. After 5 min illumination, complete cell destruction was detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and XRMA. The photodamaged cells showed influx of Na, Cl and Ca ions accompanying the immediate K losses. Ultrastructural cell damage was manifested by disintegration of the outer membrane. Total cell death of B16 melanoma cells was achieved by chemical induction of endogenous PP and photosensitization.",

In melanoma, high constitutive levels of NF-kappaB activation are usually observed. NF-kappaB is regulated by oxidation/reduction (redox) processes, and the occurrence of constitutive oxidative stress in melanoma cells has been documented. Recent studies of our laboratories showed that the membrane-bound gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) enzyme activity--expressed by a number of malignancies, including melanoma--can act as a basal source of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and other prooxidants.;In the present study we utilized the 2/60 clone of Me665/2 human metastatic melanoma, which displays high levels of GGT activity, in order to verify if the presence of this enzyme--through the promotion of redox processes--may influence the activation status of NF-kappaB. The latter was evaluated by determining the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit (by immunoblot), the DNA binding of NF-kappaB (by electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and its transcriptional activity (by gene transactivation studies).;Me665/2/60 cells displayed a basal production of hydrogen peroxide. Stimulation of GGT activity by its substrates glutathione and glycyl-glycine caused additional production of hydrogen peroxide, up to levels approx. double the basal levels. Nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit, DNA-binding and gene transactivation were thus investigated in Me665/2/60 cells whose GGT activity was modulated by means of substrates or inhibitors. Stimulation of GGT activity resulted in increased nuclear translocation of p65, while on the other hand NF-kappaB DNA binding and gene transactivation were paradoxically decreased. NF-kappaB DNA binding could be restored by treating cell lysates with the thiol-reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Treatment of cells with exogenous hydrogen peroxide did not affect NF-kappaB activation status.;Altogether, the data obtained indicate that GGT activity may impair the redox status of thiols that is critical for NF-kappaB DNA binding and gene transactivation, through the production of prooxidant species allegedly distinct from hydrogen peroxide. GGT activity therefore appears to be an additional factor in modulation of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in melanoma, capable of hindering NF-kappaB DNA binding even in conditions where continuous oxidative stress would favor NF-kappaB nuclear translocation.",

By using cell attachment assays we found that GPR4 overexpression delayed cell spreading and altered the spatial localization of dynamic focal adhesion complex, such as the localization of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, at acidic pH. The potential G-protein and downstream signaling pathways that are responsible for these effects were also investigated. By using the Rho inhibitor CT04 (C3 transferase), the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitors Y27632 and thiazovivin, the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitor staurosporine or a G12/13 inhibitory construct, cell spreading was restored whereas the inhibition and activation of the Gq and Gs pathways had little or no effect.

        "Doc_abstract":"Notch1 is an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptor involved in melanoma growth. Notch1 is first cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus to produce the biologically active heterodimer. Following ligand binding, Notch1 is cleaved at the cell membrane by proteases such as ADAM10 and -17 and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), the latter of which we recently identified as a novel protease involved in Notch1 processing. The final cleavage is Î³-secretase dependent and releases the active Notch intracellular domain (NIC). We now demonstrate that Notch1 directly regulates furin expression. Aside from activating Notch1, furin cleaves and activates several proteases, including MT1-MMP, ADAM10, and ADAM17. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and a reporter assay, we demonstrate that Notch1 binds at position -1236 of the furin promoter and drives furin expression. The Notch1-dependent enhancement of furin expression increases the activities of MT1-MMP and ADAM10 but not that of ADAM17, as demonstrated by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of furin, and promotes the cleavage of Notch1 itself. These data highlight a novel positive-feedback loop whereby Notch1-dependent furin expression can induce Notch1 signaling by increasing Notch1 processing and by potentiating the activity of the proteases responsible for Notch1 activation. This leads to Notch1 signal amplification, which can promote melanoma tumor growth and progression, as demonstrated by the inhibition of cell migration and invasion upon furin inhibition downstream of Notch1. Disruption of such feedback signaling might represent an avenue for the treatment of melanoma. ",

Co-culture of B16-BL6 cells with a fibroblast monolayer without cellular contact in a Transwell chamber more effectively induced tumor-cell invasion into Matrigel basement membrane than co-culture of B16-F1 cells with a fibroblast monolayer. The activity was closely correlated with the chemotactic migration of tumor cells toward the fibroblast monolayer. We also found that the conditioned medium (CM) from the co-culture of fibroblasts with B16-BL6 cells without cellular contact, i.e., CM (B16-BL6/fibroblast), rather than from co-culture with B16-F1 cells, could potentially promote the migration of tumor cells of both types. Tumor cells did not chemotactically migrate to the CM (B16-BL6), CM (B16-F1) or CM (fibroblast). Antibodies against TGF-beta 1 or FN almost completely abolished the chemotactic migration of B16-BL6 cells to the CM (B16-BL6/fibroblast) or CM (TGF-beta 1-treated fibroblast) when these antibodies were co-incubated with fibroblasts and either B16-BL6 or TGF-beta 1. In contrast, the anti-EGF antibody did not show any inhibitory effects. Analysis of amounts of TGF-beta 1 or FN in various CM using ELISA plates, and using their specific antibodies, revealed that the concentration of TGF-beta 1 in the CM (B16-BL6) was slightly higher than in the CM (B16-F1), and the amount of FN in the CM (B16-BL6/fibroblast) was twice as high as in the CM (B16-F1/fibroblast). These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 released from B16-BL6 cells can stimulate fibroblasts to produce FN; consequently, the tumor cells were able to chemotactically migrate toward the released FN, and the differences in invasive and migratory activities towards fibroblasts in B16-BL6 and B16-F1 cells may in part be due to the amounts of TGF-beta 1 from tumor cells and of FN from TGF-beta 1-stimulated fibroblasts.",

InsP1 and InsP2 were maximally increased 130% of control values. Treatment with AMF stimulated a parallel dose-dependent increase in both motility and PtdIns levels. We have shown previously that the A2058 motile response to AMF is inhibited markedly by cell pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PT). Inositol phosphate production was inhibited by a 2-hour pretreatment of cells with PT (0.5 microgram/ml). PT treatment of A2058 membranes was associated with ADP-ribosylation of a 40-kDa protein consistent with the presence of an alpha subunit of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). These data indicate that AMF elicits increases in cell motility and phosphoinositide metabolism via a PT-sensitive G protein signal transduction pathway.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare the invasive properties of normal human cutaneous melanocytes and of a cutaneous melanoma cell line (HBL) in a three-dimensional model of reconstructed human skin. Specifically, we asked to what extent the pigmentary and invasive behaviour of both cells is influenced by their interaction with adjacent skin cells (keratinocytes and fibroblasts) and the basement membrane (BM). In the presence of a BM, normal human melanocytes within this model remained within the basal layer of keratinocytes and did not pigment spontaneously. When the BM was removed, melanocytes were found suprabasally and pigmented extensively. No significant invasion of melanocytes into the dermis was detected in the presence or absence of the BM. HBL melanoma cells showed no significant ability to invade into the dermis in the absence of other cells, irrespective of the presence or absence of the BM. However, when added to keratinocytes and fibroblasts, HBL cells showed a capacity to invade into the dermis, both in the presence and absence of the BM. Associated with HBL invasion into the dermis, we noted significant keratinocyte entry into the dermis. On their own, keratinocytes entered the dermis in the absence of the BM but showed no significant penetration into the dermis when the BM was present. In summary, this model demonstrates clear differences between melanocytes and a melanoma cell line with respect to their invasive properties. It also allows demonstration of interactions between cells, and between cells and the BM. The study also provides evidence for a synergistic interaction between this melanoma cell line and keratinocytes in penetrating the BM.",

Most of this degradation is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of enzymes that, collectively, degrades the extracellular matrix. Although the basement membrane-degrading enzymes, MMP-2 and MMP-9, have been given considerable attention for their roles in invasion and metastasis, the interstitial collagenases, a subfamily of MMPs that cleaves the stromal collagens types I and III, have received relatively little recognition for their part in these processes. This subfamily is comprised of collagenase 1 (MMP-1), collagenase 3 (MMP-13), and the MT-MMPs, membrane-bound MMPs, and numerous reports over the last several years document the expression of these MMPs in a wide variety of advancing tumors. Of particular interest is a single nucleotide polymorphism in the MMP-1 promoter that increases the transcription of this gene and that is associated with melanoma and with ovarian and endometrial cancers. The collagenases can mediate tumor invasion through several mechanisms, which include constitutive production of enzyme by the tumor cells, induction of collagenase production in the neighboring stromal cells, and interactions between tumor/ stromal cells to induce collagenase production by one or both cell types. Thus, evidence indicates that elevated expression of the interstitial collagenases is associated with a poor prognosis in a variety of cancers, and therefore, these MMPs can serve as a marker of tumor progression.",

When analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulfate solutions, the extracellular matrix was shown to be primarily composed of a protein of identical migration and molecular weight to fibronectin. Tumor-cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated polyvinyl surfaces mimicked the rapid rate of attachment of tumor cells to extracellular matrix, and tumor cells adherent to either extracellular matrix or fibronectin-coated polyvinyl dishes adopted an unusual, highly spread and flattened morphology with numerous small projections.

Degradation of the extracellular matrix is, therefore, the sine qua non of tumor cell invasion. this degradation is mediated mainly by MMPs, and thus, inhibition of MMP synthesis is a target for anticancer agents. Tumor cells must traverse both the basement membrane (type IV collagen) and the interstitial stroma (type I collagen). Therefore, we used scanning electron microscopy to examine the invasive behavior of several aggressive tumor cell lines, A2058 melanoma cells, and SCC and FaDu squamous cell carcinomas through these matrices; and we monitored the ability of all-trans retinoic acid and several RAR-specific ligands to block invasion. We demonstrate that several retinoids, which are specific RAR alpha, beta, or gamma agonists/antagonists, selectively inhibited MMP synthesis in the three tumor cell lines. However, there was not a common pattern of MMP inhibition by a particular retinoid. For instance, a RAR alpha antagonist suppressed MMP-1 and MMP-2 synthesis in the melanoma cell line, but not in the FaDu or SCC-25 cells. On the other hand, synthesis of MMP-1 and MMP-9 by the FaDu cells was affected hardly at all, while a RAR gamma antagonist reduced the levels of MMP-2. Only all-trans retinoic acid reduced MMP-1 synthesis in these cells. We postulate that the differences may be related to a differential pattern of RAR expression in each of these cells, and that the RARs expressed by each cell line may not be targets of these RAR specific compounds. All-trans retinoic acid is a pan ligand, binding to all three RARs and, therefore, may modulate gene expression more generally. We conclude that the power of these new ligands lies in their specificity, which can be directed towards modulating expression of certain RARs and, thus, of certain MMPs. By blocking MMP synthesis, retinoids may be effective in cancer therapy by decreasing tumor invasiveness.",

As previously reported, overexpression of SMC results in suppression of both cell adhesion and immune killing of tumor cells. SMC also acts as a ligand for ErbB2/Neu, modulating phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase in the presence and absence of heregulin. The present studies investigated the effect of Muc4/SMC up-regulation on primary tumor growth using a tetracycline-inducible SMC expression system in a xenotransplanted tumor model. SMC up-regulation provoked rapid growth of transfected A375 melanoma in nude mice. Up-regulation of SMC, however, did not significantly increase proliferation of A375 cells in vitro. Instead, a strong suppression of apoptosis was observed in situ in SMC-overexpressing tumors. These data suggest that Muc4/SMC expression promotes tumor growth in vivo at least in part via suppression of tumor cell apoptosis. Importantly, reduction of apoptosis was also observed in vitro, indicating that anti-apoptotic effect of SMC is independent of tumor-host interactions. These findings strongly suggest that SMC up-regulation alters intracellular signaling to favor cell survival, providing for the first time evidence for the regulation of programmed cell death by a gene of the MUC family.",

To date, mechanisms referring to tumor exosome trafficking, including release and cell-cell transmission, have not been described. To gain insight into this, exosomes purified from metastatic melanoma cell medium were labeled with a lipid fluorescent probe, R18, and analyzed by spectrofluorometry and confocal microscopy. A low pH condition is a hallmark of tumor malignancy, potentially influencing exosome release and uptake by cancer cells. Using different pH conditions as a modifier of exosome traffic, we showed (i) an increased exosome release and uptake at low pH when compared with a buffered condition and (ii) exosome uptake by melanoma cells occurred by fusion. Membrane biophysical analysis, such as fluidity and lipid composition, indicated a high rigidity and sphingomyelin/ganglioside GM3 (N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide) content in exosomes released at low pH. This was likely responsible for the increased fusion efficiency. Consistent with these results, pretreatment with proton pump inhibitors led to an inhibition of exosome uptake by melanoma cells. Fusion efficiency of tumor exosomes resulted in being higher in cells of metastatic origin than in those derived from primary tumors or normal cells. Furthermore, we found that caveolin-1, a protein involved in melanoma progression, is highly delivered through exosomes released in an acidic condition. The results of our study provide the evidence that exosomes may be used as a delivery system for paracrine diffusion of tumor malignancy, in turn supporting the importance of both exosomes and tumor pH as key targets for future anti-cancer strategies.",

To observe cell morphological changes and viability, flow cytometric assays, cell counting, and a contrast-phase microscopic examination were carried out in A375.S2 cells after BITC treatment. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were assessed with the analysis of cell cycle by flow cytometric assays, DAPI staining, propidium iodide (PI), and annexin V staining. Apoptosis-associated factors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨(m)), intracellular Ca(2+) release, and caspase-3 activity were evaluated by flow cytometric assays. Abundance of cell cycle and apoptosis associated proteins was determined by Western blotting. AIF and Endo G expression was examined by confocal laser microscope. Results indicated that (1) BITC significantly reduced cell number and induced cell morphological changes in a dose-dependent manner in A375.S2 cells; (2) BITC induced arrest in cell cycle progression at G(2)/M phase through cyclin A, CDK1, CDC25C/Wee1-mediated pathways; (3) BITC induced apoptosis and increased sub-G(1) population; and (4) BITC promoted the production of ROS and Ca(2+) and loss of ÎÎ¨(m) and caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, BITC induced the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and induced up-regulation of Bax in A375.S2 cells. Moreover, BITC-induced cell death was decreased after pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, a ROS scavenger) in A375.S2 cells. In conclusion, the results showed that BITC promoted the induction of G(2)/M phase arrest and apoptosis in A375.S2 human melanoma cells through ER stress- and mitochondria-dependent and death receptor-mediated multiple signaling pathways.

The synthesis of heavy-chain and light-chain (beta 2-microglobulin) components of MHC class I antigens was enhanced by both IFN-gamma and IFN-beta; IFN-gamma showed the greater activity. IFN-gamma and IFN-beta also enhanced the expression of class I antigens on the plasma membrane in a dose-dependent manner; IFN-gamma was again the more active agent. Only IFN-gamma induced the membrane appearance of class II antigens in cell lines that appeared negative for HLA-DR expression by all criteria. However, in SW480 cells, which spontaneously express low levels of HLA-DR, IFN-gamma and IFN-beta both enhanced the expression of class II antigens. These results suggest that IFN of both types amplify the products of actively transcribed genes, but that type II IFN is unique in its capacity to induce HLA-DR expression in nonconstitutive cell lines. Kinetic studies showed that enhancement of class I membrane expression preceded the induction of class II expression and peaked earlier. The specificity of these responses was underlined by the inability of either IFN to enhance the synthesis or expression of the tumor-associated membrane glycoprotein gp22.

Here we report that LamA2091-2108 increases t-PA production by the highly metastatic murine melanoma cell line B16F10, with no effect on the parental B16F1 line, which has a low metastatic capacity. Incubation of plasminogen with B16F10-conditioned medium results in direct activation of the zymogen to plasmin. Furthermore, following incubation of B16F10 cells with plasminogen, plasmin is eluted from the cell surface, suggesting that these cells contain binding sites for plasminogen/plasmin in close proximity to t-PA binding sites. Quantitation of t-PA activity using the synthetic substrate Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide indicates a minimal 10-fold increase in t-PA in the conditioned medium of B16F10 cells grown in the presence of LamA2091-2108, with no increased t-PA activity observed in B16F1-conditioned medium. Similar results were obtained in immunocapture experiments which are specific for t-PA antigen. In addition, B16F10 melanoma-associated t-PA catalyzes the plasminogen-dependent hydrolysis of laminin. Together these data suggest that degradation of basement membrane proteins by metastatic melanoma cells may release fragments (such as LamA2091-2108) which stimulate both the production and activity of metastasis-associated proteinases such as t-PA, providing a mechanism for augmentation of the metastatic capacity of B16F10 melanoma cells.",

The ligand of the KIT. stem cell factor, is a cytokine that stimulates mast cell growth and differentiation. We have studied immunohistochemically KIT expression in 23 canine mast cell tumors (MCTs), 10 histiocytomas, 5 malignant melanomas, and in 2 cell lines derived from mast cells (HMC-1, human and C2, canine). As expected, KIT was detected both in the human mast cell leukemia cell line (HMC- ) and in the canine mastocytoma cell line C2. In normal canine skin, KIT expression was confined to mast cells. All canine MCTs expressed KIT, although the intensity of the staining reaction varied considerably among the 23 neoplasms. Grade III tumors showed the highest expression of KIT, whereas grade I tumors showed the lowest expression of KIT. Two patterns of KIT expression were detected in mast cells. In normal canine mast cells and in some neoplastic mast cells, KIT appeared mainly on the cell membrane. However, in many canine MCTs, KIT is accumulated in the cytoplasm, usually near the cell nucleus. The meaning of these two patterns is not clear. Expression of KIT could not be detected immunohistochemically in any of the other neoplasias investigated. According to our results, it can be concluded that most, if not all, canine MCT express KIT. Furthermore, there is an inverse correlation between the degree of differentiation and the expression of KIT. Moreover, according to our results, KIT can be used as a reliable immunohistochemical marker for canine mast cells and undifferentiated mast cell tumors.",

Two variants of the K1735 UV-induced murine melanoma cell line were assayed for their invasive capabilities and compared with their ability to colonize the lung in an experimental metastasis assay. The K1735-M2 cells, which are highly metastatic in vivo, invaded through basement membrane matrigel at a significantly higher rate than the low metastatic cells, K1735-16, in a 72-hour assay. As a negative control, normal murine fibroblasts were incapable of penetrating the barrier. Tumor cell invasion in vitro correlated with lung colonization in vivo.

More than 150 pigmentation-related genes have been identified, including glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein b (GPNMB). A recent proteomics analysis revealed that GPNMB is localized in melanosomes, and GPNMB is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that shows high homology with a well-known melanosomal structural protein, Pmel17/gp100. In this study, we show that GPNMB is expressed in melanocytes of normal human skin, as well as in human melanoma cells. GPNMB is heavily glycosylated and is enriched in mature (stage III and IV) melanosomes in contrast to MART-1 and Pmel17, which are abundant in early (stage I and II) melanosomes. MART-1 and Pmel17 play critical roles in the maturation of early melanosomes; thus, we speculate that GPNMB might be important in the functions of late melanosomes, possibly their transport and/or transfer to keratinocytes. We also demonstrate that a secreted form of GPNMB is released by ectodomain shedding from the largely Golgi-modified form of GPNMB and that the PKC and Ca(2+) intracellular signaling pathways regulate that shedding. We conclude that GPNMB is a melanosomal protein that is released by proteolytic ectodomain shedding and might be a useful and specific histological marker of melanocytic cells.",

Inoculation of syngeneic mice with UV-irradiated B16alpha vaccine cells triggers immunity to the parental B16 tumor that is mediated by host macrophages, T cells, and NK cells. Lymph node cells from mice inoculated with irradiated B16alpha vaccine cells, but not with irradiated parental cells, proliferate when cultured in vitro, suggesting long-term in vivo activation of lymphoid cells. Both IL-15 mRNA and IL-15 protein are highly induced in B16alpha vaccine cells. The bulk of the induced IL-15 is shown to be cell-associated, either cytoplasmic or membranous. The current study investigated the feasibility of applying the B16alpha vaccination protocol to generate a cancer vaccine against murine RM-1 prostate carcinoma. In comparison to B16alpha vaccine cells, long-term IFN-alpha-treated RM-1 cells (RM-1alpha vaccine cells) showed significant IL-15 mRNA induction but relatively low IL-15 protein up-regulation. When UV-irradiated, a 3-fold increase in intracellular IL-15 was observed in RM-1alpha vaccine cells, suggesting UV damage may have negated a possible control mechanism for IL-15 synthesis. Efficacy of in vivo vaccination of syngeneic mice with UV-irradiated RM-1alpha and B16alpha vaccine cells showed correlation between high IL-15 level and high vaccine efficacy in B16alpha cells compared to low IL-15 level and low vaccine efficacy in RM-1alpha cells.

Sugar chain structures of each clone have shown to consist of the same elemental oligosaccharides, but to differ in their percent compositions. More than 84% of the neutral oligosaccharides were high mannose-type sugar chains. Most complex-type sugar chains were sialylated, of which the major structure was tetraantennary sugar chain.

An immunohistochemistry staining technique was employed to measure the expression of p-STAT3 and E-cadherin protein in 30 cases of cutaneous SCC, 20 cases of BCC, 20 cases of SK, and 20 specimens of normal skin. The results were as follows: 1) p-STAT3 protein was abnormally increased in SCC as compared to normal skin and SK (p<0.001). Expression of p-STAT3 in SCC was also significantly higher than in BCC (p<0.05). 2) Expression of p-STAT3 was higher in poorly-differentiated SCC than in well-differentiated ones (p<0.05). The positive rate of the expression of p-STAT3 correlated well with the depth of tumor invasion and with metastasis (p<0.05), but there was no correlation between the positive rate and tumor size. 3) E-cadherin was strongly expressed on the cell membranes of normal skin and SK, especially on basal cells. E-cadherin was weakly expressed on cell membranes of SCC and BCC (p<0.001), whereas its expression was significantly lower in SCC than in BCC (p<0.05). In SCC, the intensity of E-cadherin expression was correlated with the extent of tumor differentiation, but there was no correlation between the expression intensity and the depth of tumor invasion or tumor size. 4) There was a negative correlation between the expression intensity of p-STAT3 and E-cadherin in SCC (rs=-0.372, p<0.05). We concluded that the overexpression of p-STAT3 may have an important role in the development of epidermal tumors.

The disease is thought to be an autoimmune process being there are antibodies to pigment cells in the sera of patients and animals with vitiligo. In the present study, sera from vitiligo patients were examined for reactivity with the human melanoma cell line, SK-Mel-28, by Western blot analysis of solubilized membrane antigens of these cells to identify the pigment cell antigens defined by antibodies in the patients with vitiligo. Antibody reactivity to human melanoma cells (SK-Mel-28) was investigated in 14 patients with vitiligo, and 16 with normal control individuals. Antibodies to the 116-113, 60, 40 KD antigens were associated with vitiligo being present in 79%, 86%, and 43% respectively of the patients with vitiligo, but in only 6%, 38% and 6% of the normal controls. In contrast, antibodies to the 160-155, 78 and 64 KD antigens were equally common in vitiligo and in normal individuals. The results suggest that autoreactivity to pigment cells occurs more commonly in patients with vitiligo than in the normal control and high autoreactivity to pigment cells in the vitiligo sera might be an impertinent epiphemenon to destroyed pigment cell.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Different proteins ensure the fine control of iron metabolism at the level of various tissues. Among these proteins, it was discovered a second transferrin receptor (TfR2), that seems to play a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Its mutations are responsible for type 3 hemochromatosis (Type 3 HH). Although TfR2 expression in normal tissues was restricted at the level of liver and intestine, we observed that TfR2 was frequently expressed in tumor cell lines. Particularly frequent was its expression in ovarian cancer, colon cancer and glioblastoma cell lines; less frequent was its expression in leukemic and melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, in these tumor cell lines, TfR2 expression was inversely related to that of receptor 1 for transferrin (TfR1). Experiments of in vitro iron loading or iron deprivation provided evidence that TfR2 is modulated in cancer cell lines according to cellular iron levels following two different mechanisms: (i) in some cells, iron loading caused a downmodulation of total TfR2 levels; (ii) in other cell types, iron loading caused a downmodulation of membrane-bound TfR2, without affecting the levels of total cellular TfR2 content. Iron deprivation caused in both conditions an opposite effect compared to iron loading. These observations suggest that TfR2 expression may be altered in human cancers and warrant further studies in primary tumors. Furthermore, our studies indicate that, at least in tumor cells, TfR2 expression is modulated by iron through different biochemical mechanisms, whose molecular basis remains to be determined.",

Incubation of monolayer cultures of Harding-Passey melanoma cells during exponential growth phase (wherin cells contained relatively few melanosomes) with isolated and labelled melanosomes during a time-period of up to 3 days resulted in rapid cellular uptake of label (reaching a saturation level after about half a day). Following a lag period of several hours, the melanin content rose near-linearly in the course of 3 days. Comparison of curves of uptake of radioactivity and melanin concentration indicates that the latter rise is due primarily to newly formed melanin. Ultrastructural studies revealed a strikingly increased number of melanosomes in melanosome-treated cells. Some of these appeared to be the result of phagocytotic uptake. In fact, invagigations of the plasma membrane containing exogenous melanosomes were observed. Since most intracellular melanosomes were localized directly in the cytoplasmic matrix, dissolution of the phagosome membrane appeared to have taken place. Aggregates of melanosomes either surrounded by a membrane or free in the cytoplasm were also observed. These bodies might represent phagolysosomes or/and centres for the formation of new melanosomes.

The antibodies were found to react with established human tumor cells in culture as well as in immunohistochemical protocols using sections of primary and metastatic lesions. One MAb, B72.3, demonstrated a high degree of selective reactivity for human carcinomas in that no reactivity was found with a large number of different normal tissues. These MAbs were used to demonstrate the heterogeneity of expression of the tumor antigens as well as the intrinsic cellular factors (i.e., cell-cycle kinetics and clonal variability) that modulate their expression. Additional studies showed that recombinant human leukocyte interferon can act as a potent regulator of surface antigen expression on human carcinoma cells. Analysis of these cells by radioimmunoassay or flow cytometry revealed that interferon treatment resulted in a higher percentage of the cell population that bind the MAb to the surface antigen. Furthermore, interferon treatment also increases the level of expression for particular tumor antigen throughout the tumor cell population. Experimental models were also developed to investigate the active localization of a radiolabeled MAb by a human tumor xenograft in athymic mice. The results demonstrate active uptake of an 125I-B6.2 by a transplantable human breast tumor that expressed significant quantities of the B6.2-reactive 90 kD tumor antigen. In contrast, a human melanoma cell line grown as a solid, subcutaneous tumor in athymic mice did not localize the labeled B6.2 and does not express the associated 90 kD antigen.

Because of this intriguing staining pattern, we investigated whether human ADAM 12 supports tumor cell adhesion. Using an in vitro assay using recombinant polypeptides expressed in Escherichia coli, we examined the ability of individual domains of human ADAM 12 and ADAM 15 to support tumor cell adhesion. We found that the disintegrin-like domain of human ADAM 15 supported adhesion of alphavbeta3-expressing A375 melanoma cells. In the case of human ADAM 12, however, recombinant polypeptides of the cysteine-rich domain but not the disintegrin-like domain supported cell adhesion of a panel of carcinoma cell lines. On attachment to recombinant polypeptides from the cysteine-rich domain of human ADAM 12, most tumor cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, were rounded and associated with numerous actin-containing filopodia and used a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan to attach. Finally, we demonstrated that authentic full-length human ADAM 12 could bind to heparin Sepharose. Together these results suggest a novel role of the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM 12 -- that of supporting tumor cell adhesion.",

Dendrite formation requires actin polymerization in the newly forming dendrite, and dendrite formation in melanocytes is stimulated by hormones and ultraviolet light. The rho-subfamily of monomeric guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins is implicated in remodeling the cellular actin cytoskeleton, resulting in the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fibers, as well as in oncogenesis and activation of the Jun/p38 mitogen activated kinase cascade. In this paper we show that rac1 induces the formation of dendrite-like structures when activated mutants are transiently expressed in B16F1 murine melanoma cells and in four human melanoma cell lines. Activated mutants of cdc42 and rhoA induced the formation of filopodia and stress fibers, respectively, in B16F1 cells, but not dendrites. A dominant negative inhibitor of rac1 abrogated the ability of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, a peptide hormone known to stimulate melanocyte dendrite formation, and ultraviolet light, to induce dendrite formation in B16F1 cells, and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and ultraviolet light stimulated the localization of rac1 to dendrite cell membranes. These results suggest that rac1 is an important signaling intermediate in dendrite formation in B16F1 cells, and that rac1 mediates the well-known ability of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and ultraviolet light to induce dendrite formation.",

However, little studies have been reported on the anti-cancer components of Pleurotus ferulae. This study aims to extract bioactive components from Pleurotus ferulae and to investigate the anti-cancer effects of the extracts. We used ethanol to extract anti-cancer bioactive components enriched with terpenoids from Pleurotus ferulae. We tested the anti-tumour effects of ethanol extracts on the melanoma cell line B16F10, the human gastric cancer cell line BGC 823 and the immortalized human gastric epithelial mucosa cell line GES-1 in vitro and a murine melanoma model in vivo. Cell toxicity and cell proliferation were measured by MTT assays. Cell cycle progression, apoptosis, caspase 3 activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), migration and gene expression were studied in vitro. PFEC suppressed tumor cell growth, inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cells at G0/G1 phases and was not toxic to non-cancer cells. PFEC also induced cell apoptosis and necrosis, increased caspase 3 activity, reduced the MMP, prevented cell invasion and changed the expression of genes associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle. PFEC delayed tumor formation and reduced tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, ethanol extracted components from Pleurotus ferulae exert anti-cancer effects through direct suppression of tumor cell growth and invasion, demonstrating its therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.

Genotoxic stress attenuates PKCÎµ effectÂ on ATF2; enables ATF2 nuclear export and localization at the mitochondria, where it perturbs the HK1-VDAC1 complex; increases mitochondrial permeability; and promotes apoptosis.

In this study, we aimed to determine the immunohistochemical expression of CD10 in BCC and SCC and to find whether it could distinguish between these two skin malignancies.;Twenty SCC and 42 BCC cases were retrieved randomly from Ayatollah Rouhani Hospital pathology archive and CD10 expression was determined in tumoral and stromal cells of each case based on immunohistochemical method. Positive CD10 staining was identified as brown cytoplasmic, with or without cell membrane staining.;In all the 20 SCC cases, tumor cells failed to stain with CD10 in contrast to the stromal cells that showed CD10 expression in 18 cases (90%). In BCC cases, the expression of CD10 was noted in tumor cells in 25 cases (59.5%) and in stromal cells of 32 cases (76.2%). There was no relation between CD10 expression in aggressive and non- aggressive BCC.;Our findings suggest that CD10 is a useful immunohistochemical marker to differentiate between BCC and SCC.

Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), PKC-alpha, PKC-beta, and PKC-delta were detected by Western blotting. Caspase activity was determined spectrophotometrically.;Quercetin induced the condensation of nuclei of B16-BL6 cells in a dose-dependent pattern as visualized by Hoechst 33258 and propidium iodide dying. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by quercetin, while doxorubicin, a PKC inhibitor, markedly decreased it. Both PMA and doxorubicin showed a consistent effect on the fragmentation of nuclear DNA caused by various dosages of quercetin. Quercetin dose-dependently led to loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, which was also significantly reinforced or antagonized by PMA and doxorubicin, respectively. Moreover, PMA showed reinforcement, while doxorubicin showed significant antagonization, of the quercetin-mediated decrease in the expression of Bcl-2. Quercetin promoted caspase-3 activity in a dose-dependent manner, which was also regulated by PMA and doxorubicin with a pattern similar to that seen in their effect on apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and Bcl-2 expression, but none of these were directly affected by PMA and doxorubicin. Free fatty acid and chlorpromazine, a PKC activator and inhibitor, respectively, did not interfere with these effects of quercetin. B16-BL6 cells expressed PKC-alpha, PKC-beta, and PKC-delta. Quercetin dose-dependently inhibited the expression of PKC-alpha but not that of PKC-beta and PKC-delta. Doxorubicin almost completely blocked the effect of quercetin on the expression of PKC-alpha. Quercetin was also involved in the translocation of PKC-delta from the cytosol to the nucleus. PMA enhanced the effect of quercetin on the translocation of PKC-delta.;These results indicate that quercetin induced apoptosis of murine melanoma B16-BL6 cells by injuring their mitochondria, increasing the activity of caspase-3, inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2 and PKC-alpha, and inducing the translocation of PKC-delta.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer metastasis is one of the major challenges in cancer research. Inhibitors of tumor metastasis are rapidly emerging as important new drug candidates for cancer therapy. Tumor metastasis formation occurs via a complex multistage process which involves a crucial step of tumor invasion through the basement membrane. Tumor cell invasion involves attachment of tumor cell to the basement membrane through laminin, degradation of the matrix by proteolytic enzymes from the tumor cell and cell migration through the basement membrane. New drugs aimed at the metabolism of tumor cell surface oligosaccharides and/or catabolism of glycoconjugates of extracellular matrix and basement membrane could inhibit tumor metastasis. In this article, current progress in the control of tumor metastasis by gem-diamine 1-N-iminosugars and related iminosugars (nojirimycin and d-glucaro-delta-lactam), which are potent and specific inhibitors of carbohydrate metabolism and catabolism, has been reviewed. gem-Diamine 1-N-iminosugars related to d-glucuronic acid and l-iduronic acid, nojirimycin and d-glucaro-delta-lactam suppress invasion of B16 melanoma variants and 3LL (lung carcinoma) cells through reconstituted basement membrane, and inhibit pulmonary metastasis of these tumor cells in mice and/or cKDH-8/11 (liver carcinoma) cells in rats. These results suggest that the metabolism of beta-d-glucuronide and alpha-l-iduronide of glycoconjugates and/or the processing of carbohydrates of tumor cell surface may participate in tumor metastasis. That these gem-diamine 1-N-iminosugars and related iminosugars are potent inhibitors of tumor metastasis holds promise of new drug candidates for cancer chemotherapy.",

For the primary tumor, this neovascularization provides nutrients and oxygen as well as a route by which metastatic tumor cells gain access to the circulatory system. Among these metastatic tumor cells, there are subgroups of cells that express an angiogenesis-inducing cells phenotype (AICs) as well as others that do not. Tumor cells not expressing the angiogenesis-inducing cells phenotype (non-AICs) invade new tissues and remain as dormant micrometastases unless they accompany AICs. Thus, either alone or with non-AICs, angiogenesis-inducing cells form rapidly growing, clinically detectable metastases. Much of the current research in this area is concentrated on the vascularization of primary tumors, but the regulation of angiogenesis by extravasating or invading tumor cells has not being extensively studied. We have developed a working model, which demonstrates that human metastatic prostate cancer cells (PC-3) appear to induce human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) to translocate across a Matrigel-coated 8 mm membrane. The parameters of this model (i.e. pore size, seeding-cell density, seeding times) were established using highly invasive murine melanoma cells (B16F10) seeded on murine microvascular endothelial cells (CD3).

The pretreatment of B16 cells for 48 hours with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 significantly inhibited in vitro invasiveness through the ECM by a mechanism that is not directly correlated with the inhibition of cell proliferation. When cells were treated with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 for only 8 hours during the assay, no inhibitory effect was observed, suggesting that pretreatment with the hormone for more than 8 hours is necessary to inhibit the invasive potential of B16 cells. The activity of B16 cells to adhere to reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) and type IV collagenolysis was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 for 48 hours. Cell motility was not influenced by the hormone. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 3 x 106 B16 cells and were given 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 (0.5 microg/kg) or vehicle daily for 28 days, beginning 1 day after tumor inoculation. In the 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated group, no significant inhibition in exponential tumor growth, body weight, and serum level of calcium was observed until the twenty-eighth day. The mean serum concentration of the hormone was about 50 ng/mL, and there were no significant changes in its concentration during the treatment period. In both spontaneous and experimental metastasis models of tumor-bearing mice, treatment with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 inhibited pulmonary metastasis. These findings suggest that 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 acts on B16 cells, inhibiting invasiveness through the ECM that is caused by the inhibition of cell adhesion to the ECM and the degradation of the ECM by the cells. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 may have the potential to inhibit metastasis by a mechanism that is not exclusively based on its anti-cell proliferative effect.",

It has been found that activity of this enzyme is highly responsive to beta-melanotropin (beta-MSH) and other hormones possessing melanotropic activity (e.g., alpha-melanotropin (alpha-MSH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH1-24)). beta-MSH stimulation of adenylate cyclase, both in the intact cell and in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction derived thereof, was shown to be saturable and dose-dependent. In addition, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was found to be a potent stimulator of AC activity in these cells. Hormone stimulation of enzyme activity in the intact cell was strongly potentiated by forskolin which not only enhanced maximal AC activity 3-fold, but lowered by 40-fold the concentration of beta-MSH required for half-maximal stimulation. Using biologically active [125I]iodo-beta-MSH prepared in our laboratory we have examined the specificity of beta-MSH binding to its receptor in both intact M2R cells and plasma membranes derived thereof. Among a series of hormones tested only alpha-MSH and ACTH1-24 competed with [125I]iodo-beta-MSH for binding to the melanotropin receptor in accordance with the results obtained with AC. In contrast to the strong effect on cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in M2R cells forskolin has no effect on [125I]iodo-beta-MSH binding.

Tumor was transplanted by the injection of wild-type B16 cells. Tumor growth and survival were measured to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination. Specific humoral response and immunoglobulin G (IgG) switch were evaluated measuring total IgG and IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes against tumor membrane proteins of B16 cells. In preventive vaccination, all treated groups showed delayed tumor growth. In addition, the group vaccinated to express only GM-CSF achieved 100% animal survival (P<0.005). Vaccination with GM-CSF+IL-12-producing B16 cells yielded lesser results (60% survival, P<0.005). Furthermore, all surviving animals remained disease-free after second tumor implantation 1 year later. The therapeutic vaccination strategies resulted in significantly delayed tumor growth, mainly using B16 cells producing GM-CSF+IL-12 cytokines, with 70% tumor growth inhibition (P<0.001)-although none of the animals reached overall survival.

RB showed strong absorption maxima (Î»max) under visible light followed by UV-B and UV-A. RB under sunlight exposure showed a time-dependent photodegradation. Our results show that photosensitized RB generates (1)O2 via Type-II photodynamic pathway and induced DNA damage under sunlight/UV-R exposure. 2'dGuO degradation, micronuclei formation, and single- and double-strand breakage were the outcome of photogenotoxicity caused by RB. Quenching studies with NaN3 advocate the involvement of (1)O2 in RB photogenotoxicity. RB induced linoleic acid photoperoxidation, which was parallel to (1)O2-mediated DNA damage. Oxidative stress in A375 cell line (human melanoma cell line) was detected through DCF-DA assay. Photosensitized RB decreased maximum cellular viability under sunlight followed by UV-B and UV-A exposures. Apoptosis was detected as a pattern of cell death through the increased of caspase-3 activity, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and PS translocation through inner to outer plasma membrane. Increased cytosolic levels of Bax also advocate the apoptotic cell death. We propose a p53-mediated apoptosis via increased expression of Bax gene and protein. Thus, the exact mechanism behind RB phototoxicity was the involvement of (1)O2, which induced oxidative stress-mediated DNA and membrane damage, finally apoptotic cell death under natural sunlight exposure.

Ca-SP significantly inhibited the invasion of these tumor cells through Matrigel/fibronectin-coated filters. Ca-SP also inhibited the haptotactic migration of tumor cells to laminin, but it had no effect on that to fibronectin. Ca-SP prevented the adhesion of B16-BL6 cells to Matrigel and laminin substrates but did not affect the adhesion to fibronectin. The pretreatment of tumor cells with Ca-SP inhibited the adhesion to laminin, while the pretreatment of laminin substrates did not. Ca-SP had no effect on the production and activation of type IV collagenase in gelatin zymography. In contrast, Ca-SP significantly inhibited degradation of heparan sulfate by purified heparanase.

Survivin, another protein involved in angiogenesis, is strongly expressed in most human cancers, where it promotes tumor survival by reducing apoptosis as well as favoring endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The mechanisms by which cancer cells induce VEGF expression and angiogenesis upon survivin up-regulation remain to be fully established. Since the PI3K/Akt signalling and Î²-catenin-Tcf/Lef dependent transcription have been implicated in the expression of many cancer-related genes, including survivin and VEGF, we evaluated whether survivin may favor VEGF expression, release from tumor cells and induction of angiogenesis in a PI3K/Akt-Î²-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent manner. Here, we provide evidence linking survivin expression in tumor cells to increased Î²-catenin protein levels, Î²-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and expression of several target genes of this pathway, including survivin and VEGF, which accumulates in the culture medium. Alternatively, survivin downregulation reduced Î²-catenin protein levels and Î²-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. Also, using inhibitors of PI3K and the expression of dominant negative Akt, we show that survivin acts upstream in an amplification loop to promote VEGF expression. Moreover, survivin knock-down in B16F10 murine melanoma cells diminished the number of blood vessels and reduced VEGF expression in tumors formed in C57BL/6 mice. Finally, in the chick chorioallantoid membrane assay, survivin expression in tumor cells enhanced VEGF liberation and blood vessel formation. Importantly, the presence of neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies precluded survivin-enhanced angiogenesis in this assay. These findings provide evidence for the existance of a posititve feedback loop connecting survivin expression in tumor cells to PI3K/Akt enhanced Î²-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription followed by secretion of VEGF and angiogenesis.

However, a difference between equilibrium binding properties of NGF-receptor on PC12 and A875 cells was observed. PC12 cells exhibited biphasic binding properties with two apparent binding sites: KD = 5.2 nM sites and KD = 0.3 nM sites. The high-affinity PC12 binding sites were trypsin resistant, and 125I-NGF dissociated slowly from them. A875 cells exhibited sites with homogeneous properties (KD = 1.0 nM), all binding sites were trypsin sensitive, and 125I-NGF dissociated rapidly in the presence of unlabelled NGF. Membrane-enriched fractions from either cell type contained binding sites with a uniform low affinity (KD = 3 nM) that were trypsin sensitive, and 125I-NGF rapidly dissociated from them. Sixty to 80 percent of binding sites in membranes could be converted to the high-affinity, trypsin-resistant state by addition of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The loss of high-affinity, trypsin-resistant sites from PC12 cells during preparation of plasma membrane fractions does not appear to be the result of selective isolation of low-affinity sites or proteolytic degradation since there is a loss of 125I-NGF binding immediately after cell lysis which is not blocked by protease inhibitors. Also, high-affinity, trypsin-resistant binding sites are not found associated with other cell fractions. The differences between receptor properties on PC12 cells and on A875 cells apparently are the result of differences in the respective intracellular environments. Thus, significant structural homology exists between receptors on A875 and PC12 cells. Cell components other than the binding unit of the NGF receptor may be responsible for the different properties of receptor.",

In normal cells, the tightly regulated pathway relays extracellular signals from cell membrane to nucleus via a cascade of phosphorylation events. In melanomas, dysregulation of the MAPK pathway occurs frequently due to activating mutations in the B-RAF and RAS genes or other genetic or epigenetic modifications, leading to increased signaling activity promoting cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, migration, survival and angiogenesis. However, identification of ideal pathway member to therapeutically target for maximal clinical benefit to melanoma patients remains a challenge. This review provides an overview of the obstacles faced targeting the MAPK pathway and why certain therapeutic approaches succeed while others fail. The review summarizes the roles played by the proteins, therapeutic potential and the drugs available to target each member of the pathway as well as concerns related to each. Potential for targeting multiple points and inhibiting other pathways along with MAPK inhibition for optimal efficacy are discussed along with explanations for development of drug resistance, which includes discussions related to cross-talk between pathways, RAF kinase isoform switching and phosphatase deregulation. Finally, the use of nanotechnology is reviewed as an approach to target the MAPK pathway using both genetic and pharmacological agents simultaneously targeting multiple points in the pathway or in combination with other cascades.",

We hypothesized that similar to its proangiogenic capacity, heparanase is also engaged in lymphangiogenesis and utilized the D2-40 monoclonal antibody to study lymphangiogenesis in tumor specimens obtained from 65 head and neck carcinoma patients. Lymphatic density was analyzed for association with clinical parameters and heparanase staining. We provide evidence that lymphatic vessel density (LVD) correlates with head and neck lymph node metastasis (N-stage, p = 0.007) and inversely correlates with tumor cell differentiation (p = 0.007). Notably, heparanase staining correlated with LVD (p = 0.04) and, moreover, with VEGF C levels (p = 0.01). We further demonstrate that heparanase overexpression by epidermoid, breast, melanoma and prostate carcinoma cells induces a 3- to 5-fold elevation in VEGF C expression in vitro and facilitates tumor xenograft lymphangiogenesis in vivo, whereas heparanase gene silencing was associated with decreased VEGF C levels. These findings suggest that heparanase plays a unique dual role in tumor metastasis, facilitating tumor cell invasiveness and inducing VEGF C expression, thereby increasing the density of lymphatic vessels that mobilize metastatic cells.",

In particular, the activation of pro-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 on the surface of malignant cells by membrane-bound MT1-MMP has been shown to contribute to the invasive abilities of various tumours. This study presents evidence that in tissue of malignant melanomas, increased effective gelatinolytic activity is mainly located at sites where melanoma cells interact with the surrounding extracellular matrix. Forty-one primary melanomas (30 superficial spreading and 11 nodular type) and six lymph node metastases were investigated by a modified technique of gelatin in situ zymography. This technique localizes areas of effective proteolytic activity within tissue sections. In 28/41 (68%) primary melanomas and in 6/6 (100%) metastases, considerable proteolysis was detected at the invading part of the tumour and especially at sites of tumour-stroma interactions, whereas no or only weak proteolytic activity was localized within the centres of solid nests of tumour cells. Zymographic analysis of extracts obtained from different areas of microdissected melanoma specimens identified activated MMP-2 as the enzyme responsible for this activity. Immunohistochemical analysis detected strong staining for MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, even in areas in which no proteolytic activity was found by in situ zymography, emphasizing the importance of more functional techniques for the investigation of balanced proteolytic systems. This technology makes it possible to draw conclusions regarding the balance between activated proteases and inhibitors, which are frequently found to be present together in close proximity in vivo.",

After PMA treatment, NGA appeared as 3 different bands of 24, 29 and 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The 29 kDa band is similar to the one obtained by treatment with the ionophore monensin, which inhibits NGA O-glycosylation. PMA can modulate plasma membrane ion exchange, most likely by activating protein kinase C. In G361 cells PMA may produce the same net effect as monensin, by impairing transport in the Golgi complex and consequently inhibiting protein O-glycosylation through an ionophore-like effect. Treatment of G361 cells with both PMA and protein kinase C inhibitors re-established the usual NGA glycosylation pattern. Thus the observed effect of PMA on NGA glycosylation is reversible and appears to be mediated by protein kinase C activation.",

To study the signaling mechanism by MGSA through the class II IL-8R in non-hematopoietic cells, this receptor was overexpressed in the 3ASubE human placental and the 293 human kidney cell lines. Membrane preparations of the class II IL-8R expressing 3ASubE transfectants exhibited a 2.3 +/- 0.2-fold increase in GTP gamma 35S binding, which was sensitive to pertussis toxin, in response to MGSA treatment (0.2 microM). This MGSA response was not observed in cells transfected with the parental expression vector. In vivo phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the class II IL-8R was basally phosphorylated in the untreated transfectants, and MGSA (5 nM) treatment markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of this receptor. The MGSA-induced receptor phosphorylation was both time and concentration dependent and could be mimicked by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187.

The thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin and the glutathione reductase/glutathione/glutaredoxin electron transfer pathways represent alternative electron donors for ribonucleotide reductase and regulate the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, the substrates for DNA synthesis, in the S phase of the cell cycle. In addition to their important role in DNA synthesis and cell division, these thioproteins provide effective antioxidant defence against oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide. In human metastatic melanoma cells and tissues the thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system is located both in the cell cytosol and on plasma membranes and is under allosteric regulation by calcium. As a consequence, calcium plays an important role in determining the intracellular redox status, cell division and differentiation. Recently, the intracellular redox conditions have been shown to be important in the reaction of alkylating anti-tumour drugs such as the chloroethylnitrosoureas. In addition to previously established mechanisms, these highly reactive drugs inhibit thioredoxin reductase, glutathione reductase and ribonucleotide reductase by chloroethylation of their respective thiolate active sites. Incorporation of the 14C chloroethyl group in drug sensitive and resistant human metastatic melanoma cell lines depends on the redox status, with resistant cells being more oxic than sensitive cells. Thioredoxin reductase is 500-fold more sensitive than glutathione reductase to the newly developed nitrosourea, Fotemustine (diethyl-1-[3,2 chloroethyl]-3-nitrosoureido ethyl phosphonate). It has been shown that melanomas which respond to Fotemustine therapy contain more thioredoxin reductase whereas resistant metastases yielded the opposite result.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

B16 mouse melanoma expresses GM3 and constitutes an appropriate model for the development of novel GM3-based vaccines. Recently, we hydrophobically incorporated purified GM3 into the outer membrane protein complex from Neisseria meningitidis to form very small size proteoliposomes (GM3/VSSP). We have examined the antitumour properties of GM3/VSSP vaccine and compared it with GM3 incorporated in very low density serum lipoproteins (GM3/VLDL). Immunization with four doses of GM3/VSSP vaccine (120 microg of ganglioside) plus Freund's adjuvant or Montanide ISA 51 significantly increased the overall survival of mice inoculated in the subcutis with 103 B16-F1 cells, whereas the GM3/VLDL immunogen was ineffective. The non-transient character of tumour protection was confirmed in animals surviving the first challenge and re-inoculated with 5 x 103 cells. GM3/VSSP vaccine also reduced the subcutaneous growth of highly aggressive B16-F10 cells. The importance of ganglioside structure in the tumour-protective effect of GM3/VSSP vaccine was confirmed using GM3 containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid, a ganglioside absent in melanoma cells. Immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments showed a high specificity of immune sera against GM3 and the presence of all four IgG subclasses, with a preponderance of IgG2b and IgG3. In addition, a strong anti-B16 complement-mediated cytotoxicity was induced by vaccination with GM3/VSSP. The present data indicate the molecular specificity of GM3/VSSP vaccine as well as the adjuvant-dependent and non-transient character of tumour protection in the B16 mouse model.

This study examines beta-catenin immunohistochemical expression in 40 stage I and II ovarian borderline tumors and carcinomas of the most common histological types. Membrane expression was heterogeneous in all 40 cases. However, the cytoplasm and nucleus of five (one borderline tumor and four carcinomas) of the six endometrioid lesions contained beta-catenin expression. PCR and sequencing analyses of a 200-bp fragment of exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene, encompassing the sequence for glycogen synthetase kinase-3beta phosphorylation, were performed in 11 tumors. Heterozygous substitution mutations at codon 37 in two cases (S37F and S37C) and at codon 41 in one case (T41A) were found in three endometrioid lesions (one borderline tumor and two carcinomas) with abnormal beta-catenin expression.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secreted by single T cells in response to antigen contact was trapped on nitrocellulose membranes precoated with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and was then immunochemically visualized as spots. With this assay, up to 25% of cloned cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) were detected during the test period that recognized defined melanoma antigens in association with HLA-A2.1. CD8+ lymphocytes responsive to a known immunogenic HLA-A2.1-binding peptide from reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were only detectable in HIV-infected patients, but not in anti-HIV-negative donors. T cells reacting with a peptide derived from a mutated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4-R24C) were exclusively detected among CD8+ lymphocytes isolated from blood of the patient, whose melanoma had previously been found to carry the CDK4-R24C allele. T cells responding to HLA-A2.1-associated peptides of normal melanocyte differentiation antigens tyrosinase and Melan-A/MART-1 were found at low frequencies in almost all donors tested, which might reflect a natural autoimmunity to these antigens.

These observations provide evidence that peptide-dependent TNF-alpha spot formation in vitro resulted from previous antigen exposure in vivo. Therefore, the TNF-alpha ELISPOT assay might be useful in monitoring antigen-specific T lymphocyte responses during the natural course of diseases as well as during therapeutic interventions aiming at the induction of protective T cell immunity. In addition, it might help to identify immunodominant T cell epitopes.",

        "Doc_abstract":"deltaN-p63 isoforms may act as oncogenes owing to their ability to bind to p53-reporter genes without inciting their transcription, thus blocking the p53-driven cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. A novel mechanism linking p63 and Wnt pathways has recently been proposed. Briefly, in vitro studies using squamous cell carcinoma cell lines have suggested that deltaN-p63 may block the phosphorylation of beta-catenin, leading to its nuclear accumulation and triggering beta-catenin-responsive transcription of genes related to proliferation and oncogenic biological behavior. To test this new mechanism, the coexpression of deltaN-p63 and beta-catenin was evaluated in a large cohort of human neoplasms. Two serial sections of TARP-4 multi-tumor tissue microarray, composed of 51 normal tissue cores and 400 human neoplasms [breast (n = 75), colon (n = 75), lung (n = 75), prostate (n = 75) and ovary (n = 50) neoplasms, melanoma (n = 25), and glioblastoma (n = 25)] were subjected to immunohistochemistry with deltaN-p63 and beta-catenin monoclonal antibodies. p63 nuclear expression and beta-catenin membranous, cytoplasmic, membranous + cytoplasmic, and nuclear localization were evaluated. deltaN-p63 expression and beta-catenin nuclear localization were found in 92.6% and 0% of squamous cell carcinomas, 8.9% and 0% of breast carcinomas, 13.8% and 0% of lung adenocarcinomas, 1.4% and 23.2% of colon adenocarcinomas, 0% and 4.8% of prostate adenocarcinomas, 11.1% and 5% of ovary carcinomas, 9.0% and 9.1% of malignant melanomas, and 12.5% and 40.0% of glioblastomas, respectively. No statistically significant association between deltaN-p63 and nuclear beta-catenin expression was found for all tumors. At variance with squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, p63-driven nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin is an unusual phenomenon in human neoplasms. Caution should be exercised when translating the results of studies performed on cell lines to human neoplasms.",

Pericytes have close contact with endothelial cells and are probably involved in the regulation of endothelial cell functions. Previous studies suggested a role for pericytes in microvascular proliferation in tumors. To study this cell type, we isolated human brain pericytes from microvessel segments derived from autopsy brain tissue. These cells were characterized in vitro using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Human brain pericytes were reactive with monoclonal antibodies directed against the high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, but only a minority of the cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA, 0 to 10%) or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (10 to 50%). In histologically normal human brain microvessels in situ, pericytes consistently lacked staining for these four markers. Tissue with microvascular proliferation, however, showed a marked pericyte staining for both alpha-SMA and high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen. The expression of alpha-SMA in vitro could be slightly up-regulated by incubation with serum-containing medium. An increase in alpha-SMA expression up to 40% of the total cell population was seen when pericytes were treated with transforming growth factor-beta 1, whereas basic fibroblast growth factor slightly inhibited alpha-SMA expression. Incubation with other factors (platelet-derived growth factor-AA, heparin, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) had no effect on the alpha-SMA expression at all. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 thus induces smooth muscle-like differentiation in pericytes in vitro and might play a role in the activation of pericytes during angiogenesis in vivo.",

Two distinct monoclonal IgG1 (kappa) antibodies, 19-14 and 19-24, were identified that showed identical patterns of reactivity with a large panel of tissues. Both antibodies displayed high levels of binding to membranes prepared from a majority of MFH and osteogenic sarcoma tumors tested.

Weak or no significant binding was observed with membranes from a variety of autologous and allogeneic normal adult tissues. Antibody reactivities could be specifically removed by absorption with MFH and osteosarcoma membranes but not with adult muscle membranes. An electrophoretic analysis of immunoprecipitated membrane antigens indicated that antibodies 19-14 and 19-24 reacted with the same protein, a monomer with an approximate molecular weight of 102,000. The antigen was detected in membrane preparations of MFH, osteosarcoma, and first trimester fetus, but was not present in normal adult spleen.

One of these molecules is the suppressor of tumor metastasis Nm23-H1 which linked to invasiveness and metastatic potential of human cancers. Nm23-H1 expression is down-regulated in human melanoma and invasive breast carcinoma. Recent studies have shown an association between the Nm23-H1 and oncoprotein Dbl-1 which is associated with guanine exchange and belongs to a family of Guanine Exchange Factors (GEF). In this report we show a direct interaction in vitro and in human B cells and specifically identified the pleckstrin homology domain of Dbl-1 as the domain which binds to Nm23-H1. Furthermore, Nm23-H1 and Dbl-1 colocalized in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells when expressed exogenously and showed predominant signals at the periphery of the cells particularly at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, Dbl-1 and Cdc42 expression rescued the suppressive activities of Nm23-H1 in cell migration assays. We show that Cdc42 a regulatory protein involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, cell growth and development can bind to Nm23-H1 and the kinase deficient mutant H118F but only weakly to the mutant P96S which lacks the ability to suppress cell migration and metastasis. Cdc42 also colocalized with Nm23-H1 and the Dbl-1 proteins as specific punctate signals in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. Nm23-H1 also lead to the reduction in membrane ruffles and protuberances when expressed with Dbl-1 and Cdc42. Surprisingly, Nm23-H1 interacted with Cdc42 as well as Rac1 but somewhat weaker with RhoA. These studies suggests that Nm23-H1 can negatively regulate cell migration and tumor metastasis by modulating the activity of Cdc42 and possibly other Rho family members through interaction with Dbl-1.",

Given that constitutive or drug-induced upregulation of NF-kappaB activity is associated with this chemoresistance, NF-kappaB inhibition may increase the susceptibility to antitumoral therapy. On the cellular level, two principles of NF-kappaB inhibition, proteasome inhibition by bortezomib and IkappaB kinase-beta (IKKbeta) inhibition by the kinase inhibitor of NF-kappaB-1 (KINK-1), significantly increased the antitumoral efficacy of camptothecin. When combined with camptothecin, either of the two NF-kappaB-inhibiting principles synergistically influenced progression-related in vitro functions, including cell growth, apoptosis, and invasion through an artificial basement membrane. In addition, when C57BL/6 mice were intravenously injected with B16F10 melanoma cells, the combination of cytostatic treatment with either of the NF-kappaB-inhibiting compounds revealed significantly reduced pulmonary metastasis compared to either treatment alone. However, on the molecular level, nuclear translocation of p65, cell cycle analysis, and expression of NF-kappaB-dependent gene products disclosed distinctly different molecular mechanisms, resulting in the same functional effect. That proteasome inhibition and IKKbeta inhibition affect distinct molecular pathways downstream of NF-kappaB, both leading to increased chemosensitivity, is previously unreported. Thus, it is conceivable that switching the two principles of NF-kappaB inhibition, once resistance to one of the agents occurs, will improve future treatment regimens.",

This study extended the earlier reports to demonstrate that adhesion-promoting fragments of laminin and fibronectin can inhibit the metastasis of a tumor of different histologic origin, such as murine fibrosarcoma cells. Furthermore, ex vivo pretreatment of cells with a purified 33-kDa heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin, which promotes tumor cell adhesion by an RGDS-independent mechanism, was effective at inhibiting experimental melanoma and fibrosarcoma pulmonary metastases. The survival rate of animals receiving tumor cells pretreated with this fragment was significantly enhanced relative to control groups. As with previous studies, the mechanism of inhibition appeared to involve an increased clearance rate of tumor cells from the pulmonary microcirculation.

Importantly, climacostol toxicity was more selective against tumour than non-tumour cells.

Although the functions of Ror1 and Ror2 are redundant, Ror2 exhibits more specific functions during development. We show that when expressed in mammalian cells, Ror2, but not Ror1, associates with the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family protein, Dlxin-1, which is known to bind to the homeodomain proteins Msx2 and Dlx5 and regulate their transcriptional functions. This association requires the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of Ror2, containing proline-rich and serine/threonine-rich domains, and the C-terminal necdin homology domain of Dlxin-1. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of Ror2 is missing in patients with brachydactyly type B. Interestingly, transient expression and immunohistochemical analyses reveal that both Dlxin-1 and Msx2 are co-localized in the nuclei in the absence of Ror2. In the presence of Ror2, Dlxin-1 is co-localized with Ror2 at the membranous compartments and Msx2 is retained in the nuclei. It was also found that the majority of cellular Dlxin-1 is retained in the membrane fractions of wild-type but not Ror2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, we show that transcriptional activity of Msx2, irrespective of Ror2 kinase activity, is regulated by ectopic expression of Ror2 using a reporter plasmid containing the WIP element.

However, these epithelial-mesenchymal interactions seem to be essential in tumor biology and it is not fully clear whether this interaction is tumor type-specific or has a more general non-specific character. To elucidate this question, we tested the effect of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from different types of tumors (breast cancer skin metastasis, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma arising from oral cavity mucous membrane) on the EM-G3 breast cancer cell line. The results were compared with control experiments using normal human dermal fibroblasts, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and 3T3 fibroblasts influenced by the fibroblasts prepared from the basal cell carcinoma. Our results demonstrated that expression of luminal marker keratin 8 was influenced only by CAFs prepared from any tested tumors. In contrast, all tested types of fibroblasts showed a strong stimulatory effect on the expression of basal/myoepithelial marker keratin 14. The CAFs also elevated the number of cells with positivity for both keratins 8 and 14 that are similar to ductal originated precursor cells. The expression of proliferation marker Ki67 was not influenced by any of the tested fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data indicate that CAFs are able to influence the phenotype of a breast cancer cell line and this effect is based on a tumor type-unspecific mechanism.

We used chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) to predict the metastatic ability of three B16 murine melanoma variant lines and also of human giant-cell carcinoma of the lung. Tumor cells were deposited on the CAM of eggs 10 days after fertilization. On day 7 after the tumor inoculation, the embryos were killed, and the lungs removed, minced and implanted on the CAM of other 10-day-old embryos. On day 7 after this inoculation, the tumors on the CAM were inspected under a surgical microscope, and were also checked histologically. The results accurately reflected the differing metastatic abilities of the B16 melanoma variant lines. Metastases were observed in the lungs of the embryo bearing human giant-cell carcinoma of the lung on the CAM. Using CAM seems to be a suitable way of predicting the malignancy of tumors with metastatic ability.",

In particular, we identified factors present in a lysate derived from heat-shocked allogeneic melanoma cells (TRIMEL) that are associated with TAPCells' enhanced capability to induce CD8(+) T-cell responses in vitro and in vaccinated melanoma patients.;First, extensive phenotypic and functional characterization of TAPCells was performed, followed by vaccination of 45 melanoma patients with four doses of TAPCells over a period of 2 months. Specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction was analyzed posttreatment and correlated with overall survival rates. Furthermore, heat-shock (HS)-induced factors present in TRIMEL and their effects on DC activation were identified and studied.;TRIMEL induced a committed, mature, DC-like phenotype in TAPCells and effectively activated melanoma-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Clinically, 64% of vaccinated patients showed positive DTH reaction against TRIMEL, and this was associated with improved overall survival. HS treatment of tumor cells increased calreticulin (CRT) plasma membrane translocation and induced the release of high-mobility group box 1 proteins (HMGB1). Both CRT and HMGB1 mobilization were associated with enhanced TAPCells' maturation and antigen (Ag) cross-presentation, respectively. DTH infiltration analysis revealed the presence of CD8(+)/CD45RO(+) T cells, thus confirming TAPCells' ability to cross-present Ags in vivo.;Our results indicate that lysates derived from heat-shocked tumor cells are an optimal source of tumor-associated Ags, which are crucial for the generation of DCs with improved Ag cross-presentation capacity and clinically effective immunogenicity.",

Nature Med 1999; 5: 938-942). We performed immunohistochemical analysis of RCAS1 expression in various skin tumors. RCAS1 was not detected in normal human epidermis. One of 21 seborrheic keratosis (4.8%), one of 12 actinic keratosis (8.3%), two of 16 keratoacanthomas (12.5%), and two of 14 basal cell carcinomas (14.2%) expressed RCAS1. RCAS1 was not detected in Bowen's disease (0/17). RCAS1 was positive in 45 of 61 (73.8%) squamous cell carcinomas. Interestingly, the expression of RCAS1 was mostly correlated with clinical stages of squamous cell carcinoma. It was found that 46.1% of stage I, 61.1% of stage II, 85.7% of stage III, and 83.3% of stage IV squamous cell carcinomas were RCAS1-positive. In addition, RCAS1 was found to be highly expressed in extramammary Paget's disease. Fifty nine of 63 extramammary Paget's disease samples (93.7%) were positive for RCAS1. Fifty eight (92%) showed co-expression of RCAS1 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). While two of 24 cases of melanoma (8.3%) expressed RCAS1 antigen, none of 20 cases of nevus pigmentosus showed positive staining. These results indicate that RCAS1 is a highly sensitive marker for extramammary Paget's disease. RCAS1 is also expressed in various skin tumors including squamous cell carcinoma, where positive correlation with clinical staging was documented.",

Additionally, CP-31398 was found to be able to convert mutant p53 to wild-type conformation in several cell lines.;To examine if CP-31398 can revert all mutant p53 proteins to wild-type function.;We studied a series of apoptotic responses to CP-31398 in three melanoma cell lines varying in p53 mutation status.;Upon a moderate dose of CP-31398 treatment (15 microg mL(-1)), only the wild-type p53 MMRU and the single p53 point mutation MeWo cells exhibited apoptosis. Another melanoma cell line, Sk-mel-110, containing multiple p53 mutations, did not exhibit apoptosis. Although CP-31398 enhanced overall p53 protein level, its ability to promote proper folding of p53 protein was limited to CP-31398-sensitive MMRU and MeWo cells. These sensitive cells showed an increased Bax and PUMA transcription, altered mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by the release of cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3. We also demonstrated that Apaf-1 was not involved in CP-31398-mediated apoptosis.;Our results suggest that the ability of CP-31398 to revert mutant p53 proteins to wild-type conformation may be correlated to p53 mutational status.

It was first identified on the basis of its high level of expression in melanoma cells, as compared to normal melanocytes. It is also present in many cultured cell types. In normal tissues, p97 is expressed in fetal intestine, umbilical cord, sweat gland ducts and liver sinusoidal lining cells. Kinetic studies in melanoma cells have suggested that p97 plays a role in iron metabolism. We have examined expression of p97 in cell lines derived from human colorectal carcinomas which express a differentiated phenotype. When polarized, these cells showed a preferred apical distribution of p97, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, immune electron microscopy and domain-selective biotinylation. Correspondingly, p97 was only found on the apical brush border of epithelial cells in the fetal intestine. p97 was shown to be anchored to the membrane through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol moiety by treatment with phophatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and labeling with [14C]ethanolamine. These observations provide a basis for the elucidation of the physiological role of p97 in iron metabolism and its possible role in cell proliferation and malignant cell transformation.",

Both the Mel 3 antibody and the synthetic peptide individually cause rapid detachment of melanoma cells from fibronectin substrate but, when used together, much smaller concentrations of both are required to achieve the same effect. The Mel 3 antibody was not nonspecifically reducing receptor binding to the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence since, in binding assays with radiolabeled peptide performed with cells in suspension, very little peptide is bound by the melanoma cells under these conditions but addition of Mel 3, an antibody of IgM isotype, causes a two- to threefold increase in specific binding.

Quantitative radiolabeling studies demonstrated that specially isolated lines (isolated by several passages through the Matrigel) of DU 145 cells, A2058 melanoma, and B16-F10 melanoma cells were highly invasive such that 15 to 20% migrated across a 1-mm-thick Matrigel layer within 5 h at 37 degrees C. NIH-3T3 cells, mouse fibroblasts, and 20DU 145 cells (passage 20) exhibited little or no membrane invasive behavior. Micromolar concentrations of estramustine (30 to 120 microM) inhibited invasion by the invasive cell lines in a dosage-dependent fashion. Quantitative enzymatic assays and radioimmune assays demonstrated that estramustine inhibited membrane invasion by blocking type IV collagenase secretion. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots confirmed that 30 to 60 microM estramustine blocked secretion of a Mr 105,000 collagenase protein. Indirect studies showed that a collagenase antibody raised against the Mr 105,000 protein and inhibitors of proteinase activity, including a metalloproteinase inhibitor, and 1,10-phenanthroline, blocked invasion. Because the antibodies inhibited type IV collagenase digestion of 3H-mouse type IV collagen, and invasion simultaneously, it is proposed that collagenolytic activity is involved in invasion.

Survivin has been proposed as a valid prognostic marker for invasive and metastatic melanomas and lymph node melanoma metastasis in human cutaneous melanoma and is a promising therapeutic target.;Our aim was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of survivin and Î²-catenin in canine cutaneous melanocytic tumours, in order to understand their prognostic significance.;Twenty-one melanocytic tumours (10 melanocytomas and 11 melanomas) were investigated by immunohistochemistry using specific anti-survivin and anti-Î²-catenin antibodies. A semi-quantitative method was used to analyse the results; Î²-catenin immunolabelling in neoplastic cells was evaluated as cytoplasmic, membranous or nuclear. The number of survivin-positive cells was counted within ~1000 neoplastic cells. Results were related to histopathological features, evaluated in haematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides, and to the clinical data obtained through a telephone survey with referring veterinarians.;Despite a low level of expression in the majority of cases, Î²-catenin was found to be correlated strongly with malignant behaviour (P < 0.01). An overexpression of nuclear survivin was statistically related to histological features of malignancy, presence of metastasis and death related to melanoma spread (P < 0.01).;The low nuclear Î²-catenin expression, mainly found in metastatic cases, would indicate that Î²-catenin activation may have only limited importance in the development or progression of canine cutaneous melanoma. The correlation of nuclear survivin expression with malignancy would indicate that survivin is possibly a useful prognostic marker and therapeutic target in canine melanoma patients.",

The aim of this study was to investigate if HPV could be associated with human primary malignant melanoma in non sun-exposed body areas like mucous membranes. Through the Swedish National Cancer Registry, in compliance with the rules of the Human Ethical Committee, histopathological specimens were collected from different pathological laboratories throughout Sweden. The histopathological diagnosis was reviewed, and from 45 primary melanomas, tumour tissue was micro-dissected and analysed further. A protocol for detection of HPV DNA using general HPV primers GP5 + /GP6+ or CPI/IIG, which together identify 36 different HPV subtypes, was developed. This protocol could detect presence of HPV DNA in less than 10 ng of DNA of a control cell that contained 1-2 copies of HPV type 16/cell. Before HPV testing the melanoma samples were examined for amplifiable DNA by a beta-microglobulin PCR and 39 were positive. Thirty-five of these could be evaluated for HPV DNA and no samples were positive according to all five defined criteria for HPV positivity although two were positive according to 4/5 criteria.

        "Doc_abstract":"The B16/C3 murine melanoma is a pigmented tumor that is rich in the copper-containing enzyme, tyrosinase. This enzyme, which converts tyrosine to melanin precursors, is largely associated with membrane fractions of cells and exists in a number of discrete isozymic forms ranging in molecular mass from 58,000 to 150,000 daltons and pI from 3.4 to 5.2. One of these isozymes (Mr = 58,000, pI 3.4) has been purified to homogeneity. The purified enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and the conversion of L-DOPA to dopaquinone. Ascorbic acid, tetrahydrofolate, and dopamine can serve as cofactors in the hydroxylase reaction. The Michaelis constants for the purified enzyme were 7 X 10(-4) M for L-tyrosine and 6 X 10(-4) M for L-DOPA. The Vmax for L-DOPA was much greater than the Vmax for L-tyrosine indicating that tyrosine hydroxylation is rate-limiting in melanin precursor biosynthesis. Two putative copper chelators, phenylthiourea and diethyldithiocarbamide inhibited both the tyrosine hydroxylase and L-DOPA oxidase activities of the enzyme. Phenylthiourea was a noncompetitive inhibitor while diethyldithiocarbamide was a competitive inhibitor indicating that these agents act by different mechanisms. When digested with proteases and glycosidases, higher molecular weight forms of tyrosinase co-migrated with the purified enzyme in isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggesting that the isozyme was derived from larger precursors. Thus, post-translational processing of tyrosinase may underlie isozyme diversity and this may be important in the control of melanogenesis in this tumor model.",

Three tumors were positive for CD68 (KP-1), a histiocyte marker, and each of the following markers was positive in two cases: desmin, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, and S-100 protein. All tumors tested were negative for chromogranin A, CD15 (Leu-M1), myoglobin, neurofilament protein, alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and melanoma-associated antigen (HMB-45 antibody). Immunoreactivity for cytokeratins was usually focal, paranuclear, and globoid, while reactivity for actin and vimentin was diffuse and cytoplasmic. Based on these findings, melanomas and some carcinomas should be distinguishable from lipid cell tumors. However, the immunohistochemical profiles of smooth-muscle tumors, other gonadal stromal tumors (granulosa cell tumors, thecomas), and hepatocellular, renal cell, and adrenocortical carcinomas overlap with that of lipid cell tumors, and therefore these tumors may not be distinguishable from lipid cell tumors using this technique.

Here we describe the use of the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) tumor model in studies on oncolytic adenoviral vectors. Suspensions of human melanoma, colorectal carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme cell lines were grafted on the CAM of embryonated chicken eggs. All cell lines tested formed 5-10 mm size tumors, which recapitulated hallmarks of corresponding human specimens. Furthermore, melanoma tumors were injected with adenoviral vector-carrying gene encoding the fusion protein of parainfluenza virus type 5. This led to the induction of cell fusion and syncytia formation in the infected cells. At 6 days post-injection, histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tumor sections confirmed adenovirus replication and syncytia formation. These results demonstrate that the CAM model allows rapid assessment of oncolytic viruses in three-dimensional tumors. Hence, this model constitutes an easy and affordable system for preclinical characterization of viral oncolytic agents that may precede the mandatory process of animal testing. Application of this model will help reducing the use of human xenografts in mice for preclinical evaluation of oncolytic viruses and other anticancer agents.",

We have established three UM cell lines and report a first characterisation of these cell lines.;Three established UM cell lines (UMT2, UMT26 and UMT33) were analysed according to their morphologic characteristics, melanocytic differentiation, adhesion on different extracellular matrices and proliferative activity. Copy number changes of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8 were studied by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Oncogenic mutations in UM involving exons 4 and 5 of GNAQ and GNA11, respectively, were analysed by sequencing.;All cell lines grew in suspension. UMT2 cells were homogeneous, UMT26 and UMT33 cells heterogeneous with regard to cell size and pigmentation. All UM cell lines revealed a melanocytic differentiation. UMT2 and 33 adhered on various extracellular matrices, while UMT26 only adhered to basal membrane extract (BME). This difference corresponded to the different expression of various integrins. Ki67 was expressed by 89% of UMT2 and 95% of UMT33 cells, which thus were in a proliferative stage, while only 2% of UMT26 cells revealed immunostaining for this proliferation marker. The doubling time of UMT2 was 3 days, 12 days for UMT33, and circa 3-4 months for UMT26. MLPA revealed disomy 3 in UMT2 and monosomy 3 in UMT33. The same point mutation was found in UMT2, 26 and 33, in exon 5 of GNA11 at codon 209 (p.Q209L).;The establishment of UM cell lines under serum-free conditions is possible. Characterisation of UMT2, 26, and 33 revealed obvious differences in cytomorphology, melanocytic differentiation, adhesion on extracellular matrices, and proliferative activity.

Although some of the biologic activities of this receptor have been described using either soluble LTalpha(1)beta(2) as a ligand or agonistic monoclonal antibodies (mAb), very little is known about the signaling of LIGHT via the LTbetaR. To gain more insight into the biologic functions of LIGHT, we generated a recombinant soluble form of human LIGHT (rsHuLIGHT). We demonstrate here that this rsHuLIGHT is capable of binding to the LTbetaR. Interestingly, receptor-mediated ligand precipitation analysis revealed that rsHuLIGHT bound only to human LTbetaR but not to mouse LTbetaR, indicating a species-specific receptor ligand interaction. Activation of A375 human melanoma cells by rsHuLIGHT induced an increased secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8).

Melanosomes within melanoma cells are characteristically abnormal, with fragmented melanin and disrupted membranes. We hypothesize that the disruption of melanosomal melanin might be an early event in the etiology and progression of melanoma, leading to increased oxidative stress and mutation. In this report, we examine the effect of a combination of UV treatment and metal ion exposure on melanosomes within melanocytes, as well as their ability to act as pro-oxidants in ex situ experiments, and assay the effects of this treatment on viability and cell cycle progression. UVB exposure causes morphologic changes of the cells and bleaching of melanosomes in normal melanocytes, both significantly enhanced in Cu(II) and Cd(II)-treated cells, as observed by microscopy. The promoted bleaching by Cu(II) is due to its ability to redox cycle under oxidative conditions, generating reactive oxygen species; verified by the observed enhancement of hydroxyl radical generation when isolated melanosomes were treated with both Cu(II) ions and UVB, as assayed by DNA clipping. Single-dose UVB/Cu treatment does not greatly affect cell viability or cell cycle progression in heavily pigmented cells, but did so in an amelanotic early stage melanoma cell line.",

When human melanoma cells were seeded directly (i.e., physical contact) on top of an electrically tight epithelial cell layer (5,800 +/- 106 Omega x cm2), electrical monolayer leakage led to an 18 +/- 3% reduction of transepithelial electrical resistance within 24 h. However, when melanoma cells were seeded close to the basolateral surface of the epithelial cell monolayer but separated by a filter membrane (i.e., no physical contact), electrical leakage occurred even more quickly (42 +/- 3% reduction in 24 h). Atomic force microscopy detected discrete structural changes between cells. Electrical leakage was effectively blocked by alpha2-macroglobulin or ilomastat, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases. We conclude that exocytosis of soluble proteases causes electrical breakdown of the MDCK monolayer, independently of physical contact between tumor cells and the monolayer.",

In this study, an alternative treatment concept consisting of low concentration curcumin (0.2-5 Âµg/ml) and irradiation with UVA or visible light (VL) has been tested. The experimental results show clearly that this treatment decreases the proliferation and the viability of human melanoma cells while the cell membrane integrity remains intact. We identified the onset of apoptosis characterized by typical markers such as active caspases 8, 9 and 3 as well as DNA fragmentation accompanied by the loss of cell adhesion. The mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway is predominant due to an early activation of caspase-9. The present data indicate a higher efficacy of a combination of curcumin and VL than curcumin and UVA.

The B16 and B16F10 mouse melanoma cell lines are widely used as model system for studying many aspects of cancer biology including metastasis. Compared with B16, which has a low metastatic potential, the highly metastatic cell line B16F10 displayed a higher metastatic ability along with higher expression levels of the metastasis-associated phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3). B16 cells transfected with PRL-3 cDNA (B16-PRL3) had metastatic abilities comparable to those of Bl16F10 cells. To study the molecular mechanisms that underlie metastasis, the proteomes of the B16, B16F10, and B16-PRL3 cell lines were compared using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis. Proteins that varied significantly in levels between these cell lines were selected and identified using mass spectrometry. Interestingly, many proteins, especially those present in membrane fractions, were similarly up- or downregulated in both the Bl16F10 and B16-PRL3 cells lines compared to B16 cell lines. The list of similarly regulated proteins included heat shock protein 70, fascin-1, septin-6, ATP synthase beta subunit, and bone morphogenic protein receptor type IB.

In vitro, these cells extend various types of protrusions and adopt two interconvertible modes of migration, mesenchymal and amoeboid, driven by different signalling molecules. In this review, we describe the major contributions of natural mouse mutants, mouse models generated by genetic engineering and in vitro culture systems, to identification of the genes, signalling pathways and mechanisms regulating the migration of normal and pathological cells of the melanocyte lineage, at both the cellular and molecular levels.",

Thirteen out of 14 cell cultures expressed membrane Ly-6A/E antigens; only the B16-A melanoma was negative, but it expressed Ly-6A/E after incubation with IFN-gamma. The effect of in vitro permanence was studied on early (< 10) and late (> 20) passages of B16-A melanoma and MN/MCA1 fibrosarcoma. Late passage B16-A cells were Ly-6A/E-negative and refractory to induction of Ly-6A/E (but not of H-2 antigens) by IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, or IFN-gamma; MN/MCA1 maintained a high expression of Ly-6A/E, but no increase was induced by IFNs. It was found that both early and late in vitro passages of MN/MCA1 actively produced IFN-alpha/beta. The analysis of cells of fibroblastic origin revealed a significant correlation between IFN release in the culture medium and Ly-6A/E levels. Culture of fibrosarcoma cells in the presence of an anti-IFN-alpha/beta serum reduced Ly-6A/E expression, thus indicating the existence of an autocrine loop.",

It is based on specific photosensitizer accumulation in the tumor tissue, followed by irradiation with visible light. The photochemical interactions of the photosensitizer, light and molecular oxygen produce singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen forms. The imbalance between ROS generation and antioxidant capacity of the body gives rise to oxidative stress in the cell, which initiates cell death in PDT. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of photodynamic reactions in human melanoma cell lines.;Photofrin(Â®) (Ph) was used for the photodynamic reaction in vitro as a photosensitizer. The primary cell line was MEWO cell line (granular fibroblasts), derived from a human melanoma. As a recurrent cell line we used Me45 cell line, derived from a lymph node metastasis of skin melanoma. We compared cell viability (MTT assay) to determine the effectiveness of applied therapy. The intracellular distribution of photosensitizer (Photofrin) and localization of mitochondria (Mito-Tracker Green) were detected by confocal microscopy.;We observed that Me45 and MEWO cell viability was dependent on the time of incubation after irradiation. In the recurrent cell line Ph accumulated mainly in the mitochondrial membranes and in MEWO cells also in the cytoplasm. The primary melanoma cell line exhibited significantly reduced cellular proliferation (below 50%) after photodynamic reaction with Ph.;The applied photodynamic reaction was more effective in primary melanoma cells. Additionally, mitochondrial localization of Ph can lead to disturbances of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and finally to release of apoptotic proteins.",

The difference was not due to drug toxicity, although at much higher levels of TPMP (greater than 20 microM) selective killing of melanoma cells compared with fibroblasts was observed. Some dependence of TPMP accumulation upon membrane potential was indicated by inhibition of uptake in fibroblasts depolarised by culture in calcium-deficient medium. Melanoma cells exhibited no change in TPMP uptake or membrane potential under these conditions. Uptake of safranine, an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential, did not follow the TPMP pattern. Thus, the anomalous accumulation of TPMP by human tumour cells appeared to result from either carrier-mediated transport or rapid intracellular metabolism and could not be used to determine cell membrane potentials.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Along with degradation of type IV collagen in basement membrane, destruction of the stromal collagens, types I and III, is an essential step in the invasive/metastatic behavior of tumor cells, and it is mediated, at least in part, by interstitial collagenase 1 (matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1)). Because A2058 melanoma cells produce substantial quantities of MMP-1, we used these cells as models for studying invasion of type I collagen. With a sensitive and quantitative in vitro invasion assay, we monitored the ability of these cells to invade a matrix of type I collagen and the ability of a serine proteinase inhibitor and all-trans-retinoic acid to block invasion. Although these cells produce copious amounts of MMP-1, they do not invade collagen unless they are co-cultured with fibroblasts or with conditioned medium derived from fibroblasts. Our studies indicate that a proteolytic cascade that depends on stromal/tumor cell interactions facilitates the ability of A2058 melanoma cells to invade a matrix of type I collagen. This cascade activates latent MMP-1 and involves both serine proteinases and MMPs, particularly stromelysin 1 (MMP-3). All-trans-retinoic acid (10(-6) M) suppresses the invasion of tumor cells by several mechanisms that include suppression of MMP synthesis and an increase in levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and 2. We conclude that invasion of stromal collagen by A2058 melanoma cells is mediated by a novel host/tumor cell interaction in which a proteolytic cascade culminates in the activation of pro-MMP-1 and tumor cell invasion.",

While this localization appeared to be similar to that of type IV collagen, detailed observation revealed that its localization was distinct in fact from that of type IV collagen which was thin and linear in appearance and was distributed inside organs. Type XV collagen was distributed broadly and zonally outside organs such as vascular and neural tissues. It was expressed at low levels in seborrheic keratosis and not expressed at all in actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma. Melanocytic nevi and malignant melanomas in situ were positive for type XV collagen; melanomas with dermal invasion were negative.

A single intravenous administration of BAT to mice that had been inoculated with various murine tumors (e.g., B16 melanoma, 3LL carcinoma, and methylcholanthrene fibrosarcoma) resulted in striking antitumor effects as manifested by complete tumor regression and prolonged survival of the treated mice. BAT exhibited a diminished but significant antitumor effect in athymic nude mice, which are deficient in T lymphocytes, and in beige mice, which are deficient in NK cells.

We monitored pHin and [Ca2+]in simultaneously, using the fluorescence of SNARF-1 and Fura-2, respectively. Our results indicated that steady-state pHin and [Ca2+]in between these cell types were not significantly different. Treatment of cells with NH4Cl resulted in larger pHin increases in highly than in poorly metastatic cells, suggesting that C8161 cells have a lower H+ buffering capacity than A375P. NH4Cl treatment also increased [Ca2+]in only in C8161 cells. To determine if the changes in [Ca2+]in triggered by NH4Cl treatment were due to alterations in either H+- or Ca2+-buffering capacity, cells were treated with the Ca2+-ionophore 4Br-A23187, to alter [Ca2+]in. The magnitude of the ionophore-induced [Ca2+]in increase was slightly greater in C8161 cells than in A375P. Moreover, A375P cells recover from the ionophore-induced [Ca2+]in load, whereas C8161 cells did not, suggesting that A375P may exhibit distinct [Ca2+]in regulatory mechanisms than C8161 cells, to recover from Ca2+ loads. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]ex) decreased [Ca2+]in in both cell types at the same extent. Ionophore treatment in the absence of [Ca2+]ex transiently increased [Ca2+]in in C8161, but not in A375P cells. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors such as cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and thapsigargin (TG) increased steady-state [Ca2+]in only in C8161 cells. Together, these data suggest that the contribution of intracellular Ca2+ stores for [Ca2+]in homeostasis is greater in highly than in poorly metastatic cells. Bafilomycin treatment, to inhibit V-type H+-ATPases, corroborated our previous results that V-H+-ATPases are functionally expressed at the plasma membranes of highly metastatic, but not in poorly metastatic cells (MartÃ­nez-ZaguilÃ¡n et al., 1993).

We have reported that the NF-kappaB pathway regulates tumor resistance to apoptosis by the TNF-alpha family via inactivation of the transcription repressor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). We hypothesized that RKIP overexpression may regulate tumor sensitivity to death ligands via inhibition of YY1 and up-regulation of death receptors (DRs). The TRAIL-resistant prostate carcinoma PC-3 and melanoma M202 cell lines were examined. Transfection with CMV-RKIP, but not with control CMV-EV, sensitized the cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Treatment with RKIP small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis. RKIP overexpression was paralleled with up-regulation of DR5 transcription and expression; no change in DR4, decoy receptor 1, and decoy receptor 2 expression; and inhibition of YY1 transcription and expression. Inhibition of YY1 by YY1 siRNA sensitized the cells to TRAIL apoptosis concomitantly with DR5 up-regulation. RKIP overexpression inhibited several antiapoptotic gene products such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), c-FLIP long, and Bcl-x(L) that were accompanied with mitochondrial membrane depolarization. RKIP overexpression in combination with TRAIL resulted in the potentiation of these above effects and activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3, resulting in apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that RKIP overexpression regulates tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL via inhibition of YY1, up-regulation of DR5, and modulation of apoptotic pathways. We suggest that RKIP may serve as an immune surveillance cancer gene, and its low expression or absence in tumors allows the tumor to escape host immune cytotoxic effector cells.",

Previous studies by us and others have indicated that pet dogs frequently encounter EBV or EBV-related viral infection. In this study, we explored whether EBV is involved in canine malignancies in dogs. EBV-specific BamHI W sequence was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 10 of 12 canine tumor specimens, including 8 of 10 oral tumors. Using reverse transcription-PCR, gene expressions of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1) and BamHI H rightward reading frame 1 (BHRF1) were identified in 8 and 7 of 12 specimens, respectively. A novel LMP1 variant, T0905, was predominant in 5 canine tumor specimens and found to exist in EBV positive human BC-2 cells. Another LMP1 variant, T0902, was similar to human tumor variant JB7. The BHRF1 sequence identified from these canine tumors was identical to that of the B95-8 viral strain. LMP1 protein and EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) were detected by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization, respectively, in several tumors, particularly in tumor nests of oral amelanotic melanomas. Furthermore, EBV-like virions adopting a herpesvirus egress pathway were detected in a canthal fibroblastic osteosarcoma and an oral amelanotic melanoma. In conclusion, we report the expressions of BHRF1 transcript (a viral anti-apoptotic protein), LMP1 (a viral oncoprotein) transcript and protein, EBER (a viral oncogenic RNA), and EBV-like virions in multiple canine tumors. The identity of BHRF1 and the resemblance of LMP1 variants between canine and human tumors indicate either a close evolutionary relationship between canine and human EBV, or the possibility of zoonotic transmission.",

Clinical trials targeting programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) in melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer have reported high response rates, and tumoral PDL1 expression has been suggested as a potential biomarker to enrich for patient response to these treatments. There are only very limited data to date reporting the expression of PDL1 in TNBC.;PDL1 immunohistochemistry was performed on 161 primary TNBCs and assessed in the tumour as well as immune cells in the stromal compartment. PDL1 expression was very common in TNBC, expressed in the tumour cell membrane (64%), cytoplasm (80%) and stromal (93%) cellular compartments. Cytoplasmic tumoral expression of PDL1 was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer-specific death [hazard ratio (HR) 0.45, P = 0.035] while stromal PDL1 expression was associated with a lower rate of deaths from all causes (HR 0.305, P = 0.0042). Membranous expression of PDL1 was not associated with outcome. While both PDL1 expression and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with a better outcome, only lymphovascular invasion and high tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes were independently prognostic for breast cancer-specific death.;While PDL1 expression is frequent in TNBC, it was not independently prognostic. There were differences in outcome depending on the cellular compartment of PDL1 expression.

The aim of the present study was to identify a simple yet robust method for isolating, preserving and staining cells that could be analysed by flow cytometry.;Using a simple preparation procedure, a panel of membrane-associated antibodies (ICAM-1, W632, HLA-DR) and nuclear or cytoplasmic oncoprotein antibodies (c-erbB-2, c-myc, bcl-2, p53), together with positive (PHM-5) and negative (FITC F(ab')2) controls, were assayed. It was considered important to test the protocol with markers expressed on the cell surface, and in the cytoplasm and nucleus, so as not to be restrictive and thereby exclude an antigen of potential clinical interest. In addition, such panels would also enable the generation of a 'phenotypic profile' for each specimen that may reveal clinically significant trends.;Our results indicate that tissue dissociation followed by brief fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilisation in 70% methanol produces a stable single cell suspension, which can subsequently be stained with a wide range of antibodies for the accurate identification of cells in a potentially heterogeneous tumour population.;This technology can rapidly identify sub-populations of cells expressing differing levels of proteins, which may prove to be indicative of disease progression for this aggressive disease.",

Tumor cell growth is enhanced both in vitro and in vivo in mice in the presence of basement membrane. This has led to the ability to grow various tumors including human biopsy specimens in nude mice. Furthermore, low cell numbers can be used when coinjected with Matrigel, a basement membrane extract. The basement membrane glycoprotein laminin is important in promoting invasive behavior and the level of a 32/67 kDa laminin receptor has been shown to correlate with malignancy. A sequence of five amino acids, tyrosine-isoleucine-glycine-serine-arginine (YIGSR) has been shown to recognize this receptor and to reduce experimental metastases (tail vein injection resulting in colonization of the lung) and subcutaneous tumor growth. This peptide is active in both models either when coinjected or when daily intraperitoneal injections are given after tumor growth has initiated. YIGSR does not effect cell arrest but does inhibit angiogenesis which is necessary for tumor growth. YIGSR also appears to have an additional antitumor effect via its interaction with a specific receptor. YIGSR-adherent cells established after 30 successive selections on YIGSR-coated dishes in vitro formed more lung colonies after intravenous injection and larger tumors after subcutaneous injection than the parent B16F10 melanoma cells. The YIGSR-non-adherent cells formed fewer lung colonies and smaller subcutaneous tumors. These data demonstrate the importance of laminin-tumor cell interactions in malignancies and suggest that a short sequence from laminin has multiple effects in reducing tumor growth and spread.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

One of the major laminin receptors of myoblasts is the alpha 7 beta 1 integrin, which was first described in human MeWo melanoma cells and Rugli glioblastoma cells. In order to investigate and directly test the role of the alpha 7 integrin in cell migration on laminin, we expressed the murine alpha 7B splice variant in human 293 kidney cells and 530 melanoma cells which cannot migrate on laminin and are devoid of endogenous alpha 7. Northern blotting of the transfected cells showed that the alpha 7 mRNA was expressed efficiently, and the protein was detected on the cell surface by immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Cell motility measurements by computer-assisted time-lapse videomicroscopy of the alpha 7-transfected cells revealed an 8-10-fold increase in motility on laminin-1 and its E8 fragment, but not on fibronectin. Mock-transfected cells did not migrate significantly of alpha 7-transfected 293 cells through laminin-coated filters in a Boyden chamber assay was significantly enhanced in comparison to mock transfected cells.

We examined the role of two different second messenger systems in the regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 2 (PAI-2) induction by TNF in SK-MEL-109 melanoma cells. Synthesis of PAI-2 and transcription of its mRNA could be induced by a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate. In addition, induction of PAI-2 synthesis by TNF was blocked by two PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride. The inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, N-[2-(methylamino)-ethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide dihydrochloride, was much less effective in decreasing PAI-2 synthesis. Staurosporine and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride also inhibited both TNF- and phorbol myristate acetate-induced PAI-2 mRNA accumulation. We measured the binding of 3H-labeled phorbol dibutyrate to membrane and cytosol fractions of TNF-treated SK-MEL-109 cells and found a transient redistribution of 3H-labeled phorbol dibutyrate binding from cytosol to membrane fractions in response to TNF. In contrast to the positive regulation by PKC in promoting TNF-induced PAI-2 synthesis cAMP inhibited this response. Pretreatment of cells with agents that raise intracellular cAMP levels completely abolished TNF-induced PAI-2 synthesis. Addition of cAMP-elevating agents during TNF induction could also block PAI-2 synthesis. PAI-2 mRNA accumulation in response to TNF was inhibited, but not completely abolished, by cAMP-elevating agents, suggesting that cAMP also exerted its inhibitory effect at the translation level. The positive regulation of a TNF response by PKC and its negative modulation by cAMP may provide a means for intracellular coordination of signals from interacting extracellular factors in regulating TNF responses in different target cells.",

Recently, it has been reported that calretinin is expressed by sex cord-stromal tumors. We studied six SCTs, NOS for both calretinin and inhibin expression to evaluate the sensitivity of calretinin in comparison to inhibin. We also tested for CD99, Melan-A (A103), and S-100, other markers reported to be positive in these tumors. HMB-45 and MART-1 (Ab3) completed our panel of markers. All six tumors were positive for both calretinin and inhibin. Calretinin positivity was present in 60% to >90% of tumor cells, whereas inhibin reactivity ranged from <5% to >90% of tumor cells. Membranous staining for CD99 was present in one tumor. S-100-positive cells were seen in two tumors, whereas four tumors were immunoreactive for HMB-45. All six tumors were positive for Melan-A (A103), but in general the staining was less diffuse than with calretinin. All of the tumors were essentially negative for MART-1 (Ab3).

Furthermore, double staining of B16-F10 and B16-F1 with ethidium bromide (chromatin) and fluorescamine (membranes) provides the identification of a homogeneous subpopulation of cells with enhanced metastatic potential based on differential fluorescamine uptake. Fluorescamine uptake and poststaining viability is shown to be dependent upon the dye/cell ratio at which staining occurs. Utilizing a sterile cell sorting technique, a subpopulation of B16-F10 with increased fluorescamine uptake representing 30% of the total \"intact cell\" population was isolated by means of a fluorescence activated cell sorter and replated in vitro. This subpopulation when assayed in vivo produced significantly more pulmonary metastases than its parent cell line. Scanning cytometry of the Feulgen stained sorted subpopulation reveals that the cells possess a unique nuclear morphometry characterized by a 2C-3C DNA content and a large nuclear area (disperse chromatin). Finally, when we assay simultaneously for nuclear-DNA organization and cell membrane organization a progressive uncoupling between nuclear and cell morphometry is apparent if B16-F10 (versus B16-F1).",

Polycarbonate filters were uniformly coated with a reconstituted basement membrane material and allowed to dry; each filter measured 0.035 mm in thickness when hydrated with media. Subsequently, the membrane-coated filters were suspended in Membrane Invasion Culture System (MICS) chambers, and high (A375M) and low (A375P) metastatic variants of human melanoma cells were seeded onto the membranes and allowed to incubate for 3 days. At the end of this period, cells were examined morphologically, and the invasive cells of both metastatic variants were collected, stained and counted microscopically. The tumor cells could be seen attached to the reconstituted basement membrane, buried within it, and forming colony-like aggregates in the matrix. It was determined that approximately twice as many A375M cells invaded the artificial biological matrix compared with the A375P cells (P less than 0.0005). Substantially more cells from each variant invaded uncoated polycarbonate filters, thus indicating the selective barrier imposed by the Matrigel. The utilization of such a reconstituted matrix for in vitro invasion studies allows one the opportunity to examine tumor cell attachment, migration and invasion of a uniform matrix over an extended period of time.",

A possible molecular mechanism of these effects, namely a specific interaction between the Lys-Gly-Asp motif of the phage protein 24 and beta3-integrin receptors on target cells is proposed. It was also shown that anti-beta3 antibodies and synthetic peptides mimicking natural beta3 ligands inhibit the phage binding to cancer cells.

The peak response to alpha-MSH occurred between 20 and 60 min of incubation time, and enzyme activities redistributed to those seen in the control cells over the following 12 to 24 h.

To characterize resistance to this drug, the human melanoma cell line, FEM-X, was selected in multiple steps with VP-16. To prevent the development of typical multidrug resistance, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, the tiapamil analog, RO-11-2933, was added to the selections. The resultant clone FVP3 is 56-fold resistant to VP-16 and cross-resistant to doxorubicin (Adriamycin) (9-fold) and VM-26 (27-fold). These cells are also two- to four-fold resistant to m-AMSA, daunorubicin, and mitoxantrone. FVP3 is not resistant to the P-glycoprotein substrates vinblastine, does not express the MDR1 gene at detectable levels, and does not show reduced 3H-VP-16 accumulation. Unlike other cell lines that exhibit resistance to inhibitors of topoisomerase II, FVP3 has the same level of topoisomerase II expression and activity as FEM-X. Using live cells treated with VP-16, band depletion assays and KCI/SDS precipitation assays show that topoisomerase II from FVP3 is much less susceptible to drug-induced cleavable complex formation than is that from FEM-X. This difference in sensitivity to VP-16 is also detected using lysates from disrupted cells, but not with isolated nuclei devoid of cytoplasmic and membrane components. In addition, the topoisomerase II present in nuclear extracts from FVP3 is not resistant to the effects of VP-16 as measured by: (1) inhibition of strand passing activity during decatenation of kinetoplast DNA, (2) drug-induced linearization of plasmid DNA, and (3) immunodepletion by VP-16. These results suggest that some component of the cytoplasm or cellular membranes, or a factor depleted from nuclei during their isolation, is responsible for the resistance to VP-16 in FVP3.",

Up-regulation of MMP activity, favoring proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, has been linked to tumor growth and metastasis, as well as tumor-associated angiogenesis, whereas inhibition of MMP activity appears to restrict these processes. We have used retroviral-mediated gene delivery to effect sustained autocrine expression of TIMP-3 in murine neuroblastoma and melanoma tumor cells in order to further examine the ability of TIMPs to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. Growth of both histologic types of gene-modified tumor cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice was significantly restricted when compared with controls. Grossly, these tumors were small and had few feeding vessels. Histologic evaluation revealed that although tumors overexpressing TIMP-3 had an increased number of CD31(+) endothelial cells, these endothelial cells had not formed functional tubules, as evidenced by decreased vessel continuity and minimal pericyte recruitment. This effect appears to be mediated, in part, by decreased expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin by endothelial cells in the presence of TIMP-3 as seen both in an in vitro assay and in TIMP-3-overexpressing tumors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of TIMP-3 can inhibit angiogenesis and associated tumor growth, and that the antiangiogenic effects of TIMP-3 appear to be mediated through the inhibition of functional capillary morphogenesis.",

Here, we describe the preclinical activity of a novel topical chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of skin cancer, 3-ingenyl angelate (PEP005), a hydrophobic diterpene ester isolated from the plant Euphorbia peplus. Three daily topical applications of 42 nmol (18 micro g) of PEP005 cured a series of s.c. mouse tumors (B16 melanoma, LK2 UV-induced squamous cell carcinoma, and Lewis lung carcinoma; n = >14 tumors/group) and human tumors (DO4 melanoma, HeLa cervical carcinoma, and PC3 and DU145 prostate carcinoma; n = >4 tumors/group) previously established (5-10 mm(3)) on C57BL/6 or Foxn1(nu) mice. The treatment produced a mild, short-term erythema and eschar formation but, ultimately, resulted in excellent skin cosmesis. The LD(90) for PEP005 for a panel of tumor cell lines was 180-220 micro M. Electron microscopy showed that treatment with PEP005 both in vitro (230 micro M) and in vivo (42 nmol) rapidly caused swelling of mitochondria and cell death by primary necrosis. (51)Cr release, uptake of propidium iodide, and staining with the mitochondria dye JC1, revealed that PEP005 (230 micro M) treatment of tumor cells in vitro resulted in a rapid plasma membrane perturbation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the AD1 Ag was nearly identical to that of human CD63 (melanoma-associated Ag ME491). In this study we cloned the cDNA of AD1 Ag from a rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cDNA library. An open reading frame of 238 amino acids was identified that contained the N-terminal 43 amino acid sequence. No evidence of a signal peptide was found. However, four predominantly hydrophobic stretches of sequence were predicted to form membrane-spanning helices, and three putative N-glycosylation sites were identified. The AD1 Ag and CD63 were highly conserved between rat and human, suggesting that the sequence of this protein is important for its function. By immunostaining various rat tissues, the AD1 Ag was found localized to mast cells. However, it was located to lysosomes, secretory granules and the plasma membrane of RBL-2H3 cells and to lysosomes and plasma membrane of many other cultured cell lines. The AD1 Ag could be induced by placing cells in culture. Fibroblasts and hepatocytes freshly isolated from rat embryos stained very weakly for AD1 Ag; however, after 24 to 48 h in culture they were strongly positive. This increase in the expression of the AD1 Ag was accompanied by an increase in detectable RNA message.

Integrin regulation is essential for tumor cell migration in response to growth factors. c-Abl kinase is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and is critical for signaling transduction from various receptors. Here we show that c-Abl kinase is involved in A375 cell migration mediated by Î±vÎ²3 integrin in response to PDGF stimulation. c-Abl kinase colocalizes with Î±vÎ²3 integrin dynamically and affects Î±vÎ²3 integrin affinity by regulating its cluster. The interaction between c-Abl kinase and Î±vÎ²3 integrin was dependent on the activity of c-Abl kinase induced by PDGF stimulation, but was not dependent on the binding of Î±vÎ²3 integrin with its ligands, suggesting that c-Abl kinase is not involved in the outside-in signaling of Î±vÎ²3 integrin. Talin head domain was required for the interaction between c-Abl kinase and Î±vÎ²3 integrin, and the SH3 domain of c-Abl kinase was involved in its interaction with talin and Î±vÎ²3 integrin.

Individuals with loss-of-function mutations for the glypican 3 gene exhibit Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, a rare X-linked overgrowth disorder. Expression of glypican 3 mRNA and protein is normally silenced in most adult organs and may reappear during malignant transformation. In the past few years, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of glypican 3 in hepatocellular carcinoma have been elucidated. More recently, glypican 3 has been emerging as a new diagnostic marker for germ cell tumors and especially testicular and ovarian yolk sac tumors. However, in other tumors such as renal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanomas, studies disagree on the level of glypican 3 expression. Finally, there is the controversial notion of glypican 3 as a tumor suppressor gene. In this review article, we update current knowledge on glypican 3 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, evaluate its utility as a tumor marker in clinical practice, and explore its role as a novel oncofetal protein with clinical implications. Our focus is on the diagnostic value of glypican 3 in germ cell tumors and other neoplasms in addition to hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, glypican 3 has been proven to be a useful immunohistochemical marker in distinguishing yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas, and Wilms tumors from other malignancies histologically mimicking these primitive tumors. Clinically, we recommend that glypican 3 be used as part of a panel of markers in subtyping testicular germ cell tumors. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Autophagy is a dynamic cell survival mechanism by which a double-membrane vesicle, or autophagosome, sequesters portions of the cytosol for delivery to the lysosome for recycling. This process can be inhibited using the antimalarial agent chloroquine (CQ), which impairs lysosomal function and prevents autophagosome turnover. Despite its activity, CQ is a relatively inadequate inhibitor that requires high concentrations to disrupt autophagy, highlighting the need for improved small molecules. To address this, we screened a panel of antimalarial agents for autophagy inhibition and chemically synthesized a novel series of acridine and tetrahydroacridine derivatives. Structure-activity relationship studies of the acridine ring led to the discovery of VATG-027 as a potent autophagy inhibitor with a high cytotoxicity profile. In contrast, the tetrahydroacridine VATG-032 showed remarkably little cytotoxicity while still maintaining autophagy inhibition activity, suggesting that both compounds act as autophagy inhibitors with differential effects on cell viability. Further, knockdown of autophagy-related genes showed no effect on cell viability, demonstrating that the ability to inhibit autophagy is separate from the compound cytotoxicity profiles. Next, we determined that both inhibitors function through lysosomal deacidification mechanisms and ultimately disrupt autophagosome turnover. To evaluate the genetic context in which these lysosomotropic inhibitors may be effective, they were tested in patient-derived melanoma cell lines driven by oncogenic BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B). We discovered that both inhibitors sensitized melanoma cells to the BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib. Overall, these autophagy inhibitors provide a means to effectively block autophagy and have the potential to sensitize mutant BRAF melanomas to first-line therapies. ",

We also demonstrated high-affinity binding sites for [3H]diazepam in these cells by radioreceptor assay, and we visualized binding to the cell surface by fluorescence microscopy with a benzodiazepine analog conjugated to a fluorescein-labeled protein. Our studies also showed that there are differences between the binding characteristics in intact cells and in membrane fractions prepared from these cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data from membrane fractions gave a linear plot (Kd = 9.1 X 10(-8) M). With intact cells, a curvilinear Scatchard plot was obtained. This was resolved into two components defining binding sites with affinity constants of 1.7 X 10(-9) M and 4.6 X 10(-7) M. Thus, it appears that [3H]diazepam binding in intact cells is more complex than in isolated membranes. Several related benzodiazepines, including flunitrazepam, Ro-5-4864, nitrazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, Ro-5-3072, chlordiazepoxide, and clonazepam also induced melanogenesis. When these compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit [3H]diazepam binding, flunitrazepam, diazepam, and Ro-5-4864 were found to be the most effective inhibitors. These three compounds were also the most potent in inducing melanogenesis. Our results suggest that the benzodiazepines modulate cell differentiation.

Expression of BBTY-1 in mouse L929 fibroblasts led to synthesis and expression of active tyrosinase, and, unexpectedly, to stable production of melanin.

Although the alternative splicing of CD44 variant exons represents the principal regulatory mechanism of CD44-mediated functions, CD44v spliced variants are scantily expressed in melanoma cells. For this reason, we have investigated the possibility that post-translational modifications of the CD44 standard receptor could play a pivotal role in regulating CD44-mediated functions in melanoma. Using metabolic inhibitors of N- and O-glycosylation, as well as melanoma transfectants expressing CD44s O-glycosylation site-specific mutants, we performed structural and functional analysis of N- and O-deglycosylated CD44s molecules expressed in melanoma cells. We discovered that complete N- and O-glycosylation is not required by CD44s to be correctly expressed on the melanoma cell surface. Indeed, variably glycosylated and functionally different CD44s molecules were constitutively expressed in primary and metastatic lesions. Furthermore, we observed that changes in N- and O-glycosylation of CD44s could modulate its cleavage. In fact, spontaneous CD44s shedding was dependent on the presence of partial or complete O-glycosylation of four serine-glycine motifs localized in the membrane-proximal CD44 ectodomain. Mutation of these serine residues, as well as an extensive metabolic O-deglycosylation, strongly impaired spontaneous CD44 shedding. Furthermore, an O-glycosylation-independent mechanism of CD44 cleavage has been identified. This alternative mechanism of receptor cleavage is phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) inducible, mediated by metalloproteinase and requires the presence of N-linked sugar residues. Our findings demonstrate that the post-translational modification of CD44s represents the principal regulatory mechanism of CD44s-mediated functions in melanoma.",

Immunization with appropriate variants of syngeneic antigens can achieve this. However, improvements in vaccine design are needed for efficient cancer immunotherapy. Here we explore nine different chimeric vaccine designs, in which the antigen of interest is expressed as an in-frame fusion with polypeptides that impact antigen processing or presentation. In DNA immunization experiments in mice, three of nine fusions elevated relevant CD8(+) T-cell responses and tumor protection relative to an unfused melanoma antigen. These fusions were: Escherichia coli outer membrane protein A (OmpA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, and VP22 protein of herpes simplex virus-1. The gains of immunogenicity conferred by the latter two are independent of epitope presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II). This finding has positive implications for immunotherapy in individuals with CD4(+) T-cell deficiencies. We present evidence that antigen instability is not a sine qua non condition for immunogenicity. Experiments using two additional melanoma antigens identified different optimal fusion partners, thereby indicating that the benefits of fusion vectors remain antigen specific. Therefore large fusion vector panels such as those presented here can provide information to promote the successful advancement of gene-based vaccines.",

However, the antitumor properties of xanthoceraside as well as its mechanism of action remain unclear. Therefore, we proposed to investigate its potential anticancer property. In this study, the viability of cells was measured by the MTT assay. Cell cycle and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry, and the expressions of procaspase-9, procaspase-3, Cyto.c, Apaf-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bad, p53, and IGF-1R/Raf/MEK/ERK were tested by Western blotting. Xanthoceraside significantly inhibited the proliferation of human melanoma A375.S2 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner but did not impair the viability of normal cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Further analysis revealed that xanthoceraside induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and caspase-9 in a time-dependent manner through the mitochondrial pathway but did not activate caspase-8 in the cells. In addition, xanthoceraside inhibited the expression of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is an important prosurvival, antiapoptotic signaling growth factor receptor that is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells and used as a therapeutic target for multiple cancers. Interestingly, xanthoceraside also decreased the expression of Raf, p-MEK, and p-ERK, the downstream effectors of IGF-1R. Taken together, these findings indicate that xanthoceraside induces apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, which is induced by the downregulation of IGF-1R/Raf/MEK/ERK cascades in A375.S2 cells.",

Moreover, the model's maximum membrane potential (about 1.2 V) is consistent with recent experimental observations on isolated cells. We also use the model to show that conventional electroporation resulting from 100 microsecond, 1 kV/cm pulses yields a spatially heterogeneous electroporation distribution.

Although stimulation of CTLs by class I-peptide complexes on reconstituted membranes has been documented before, this is the first demonstration of stimulation of cloned CTLs by natural, endogenously processed MHC class I-peptide complexes on plasma membranes.

The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining to differentiate OSA from other tumors that express vimentin by immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry. ALP is a hydrolytic enzyme present in multiple tissues including liver, kidney, intestine, placenta, and bone. Hypothetically, neoplasms actively producing bone should be specifically positive for ALP staining. Unstained, cytologic specimens were incubated for 8-10 minutes with nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidine salt-phosphatase substrate. A positive reaction stains the membrane of the cells gray to black. Samples were counterstained with a Romanowsky's stain to determine whether the sample was of representative cellularity. A total of 61 vimentin-positive neoplasms have been evaluated and confirmed histopathologically. Tumors that expressed vimentin and were positive for ALP included 33 OSAs, one multi-lobular tumor of bone, one amelanotic melanoma, and one chondrosarcoma. Tumors that expressed vimentin and were negative for ALP included chondrosarcomas (three of four), multiple fibrosarcomas, and multiple synovial cell sarcomas.

Before the immunocytochemical experiments, the presence of TASK-3 mRNA was also confirmed in melanoma cells. Comparison of the results of the TASK-3- and mitochondrion-specific labelling indicated that the TASK-3 channel subunits were strongly expressed by mitochondria in both investigated cell types. Moreover, prominent TASK-3 expression of keratinocytes could also be demonstrated in histological sections excised from the human skin.

One obstacle has been that some of the gangliosides that are overexpressed in human cancers are poorly immunogenic in humans. A case in point is GD3, a prominent ganglioside of human malignant melanoma. Using an approach that has been effective in the construction of bacterial carbohydrate vaccines, we have succeeded in increasing the immunogenicity of GD3 in the mouse by conjugating the ganglioside with immunogenic carriers. Several conjugation methods were used. The optimal procedure involved ozone cleavage of the double bond of GD3 in the ceramide backbone, introducing an aldehyde group, and coupling to aminolysyl groups of proteins by reductive amination. Conjugates were constructed with a synthetic multiple antigenic peptide expressing repeats of a malarial T-cell epitope, outer membrane proteins of Neisseria meningitidis, cationized bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and polylysine. Mice immunized with these conjugates showed a stronger antibody response to GD3 than mice immunized with unconjugated GD3. The strongest response was observed in mice immunized with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate of the GD3 aldehyde derivative and the adjuvant QS-21. These mice showed not only a long-lasting high-titer IgM response but also a consistent high-titer IgG response (predominantly IgG1), indicating recruitment of T-cell help, although the titers of IgM and IgG antibodies following booster immunizations were not as high as they are in the response to classical T-cell-dependent antigens. This method is applicable to other gangliosides, and it may be useful in the construction of immunogenic ganglioside vaccines for the immunotherapy of human cancers expressing gangliosides on their cell surface.",

In normal organs, YU-311 reacted with fundic glands of the stomach, the intercalated duct of the pancreas, the distal portion and the loop of Henle of renal tubules and tissue mast cells.

None of the non-epithelial tumors reacted with YU-311, except for one case of malignant melanoma.

Three new monoclonal antibodies were raised against the purified antigen and used to examine the expression of individual epitopes on cells of different lineage. All antibodies reacted with the purified membrane antigen on Western blots. Antibodies 7G2 and 7C6 reacted only weakly with activated T cells, although the 85,000 MW 7F7 antigen is recognized on T cells by antibodies 7F7 and 8B9. Whereas 7F7 and 8B9 inhibit the phorbol ester-induced aggregation of U937 and the attachment of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-activated T cells to fibroblasts, antibody 7G2 was without inhibitory effect. Four antibodies raised against the P3.58 glycoprotein, a melanoma-associated antigen with biochemical features similar to the 7F7 antigen were shown to react with the purified 7F7 antigen on Western blots. These four antibodies also failed to react with activated T cells. In addition, 7F7 bound to a L cell transfectant prepared with human chromosomal DNA which expressed the P3.58 antigen. The results indicate that the 7F7 antigen and the P3.58 melanoma antigen are identical, that some epitopes of this adherence molecule are differentially expressed on individual cell types and that one epitope, which is only weakly expressed on activated T cells, does not contribute to the role of the 7F7 antigen in some examples of cell-cell adherence.",

In the following paper we summarize the results obtained with different murine model systems which have been set up to elucidate the above mechanisms, and describe our own results with two murine models: the F9 teratocarcinoma and the B16 melanoma. While the F9 teratocarcinoma model system underscores the roles of both adhesion and growth stimulation in the target organ, the B16 melanoma model strengthens the relevance of paracrine growth stimulation. Moreover, B16 melanoma cells selected in vivo for increased liver colonization ability appear to depend on cell-to-cell contact with hepatocytes in order to gain efficient growth stimulation. When we next tried to identify the molecule(s) responsible for the growth effect in a liver plasma membrane extract, we found that such activity was mediated by two closely related protein bands. These turned out to be two different forms of transferrin (Tf), one of which is specifically present on the hepatocyte surface. Moreover, when we analyzed the different B16 lines for the expression of c-Met[the receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor-scatter factor (HGF/SF)], we found that liver-specific LS9 had more of this protein than lung-specific F10 or parental F1, suggesting a role for HGF/SF in liver colonization by B16 melanoma cells.",

Murine studies suggest that the antibody response to membrane-bound cryptic antigens, such as phospholipids and gangliosides, can be induced and augmented by attaching lipid A to membranes. Therefore, we assessed the ability of monophosphoryl lipid A, a non-toxic derivative of lipid A, to augment antibody response against membrane-associated gangliosides. Anti-ganglioside antibodies were IgM after the first and second immunizations; in contrast, anti-phospholipid antibodies were IgM after the first immunization and IgG after the second immunization. Mice (BALB/c) immunized with MPL-attached human cells as well as mice (C57BL/6J) immunized with MPL-attached syngeneic tumor cells (B16 melanoma) produced a significant IgM response. Mice (C57BL/6J) immunized with MPL-attached liposomes containing GM3 developed significantly higher IgM responses than those immunized with purified gangliosides, MPL or MPL-free B16 cells. However, the antibody response after immunization with MPL-GM3-liposomes is similar to that after immunization with MPL-attached tumor cells, even though the MPL-liposomes contained a 27-fold higher level of gangliosides than the tumor cells. Our results emphasize that co-expression of MPL with membrane-bound gangliosides is necessary to augment the anti-ganglioside antibody response. These findings may shed light on the elevated titers of anti-ganglioside IgM antibodies found in patients with motor neuron diseases, various neuropathies and classical ALS, and are relevant to clearance of circulating immunosuppressive gangliosides in cancer patients.",

There is great clinical interest in uPAR in the cancer field as numerous reports have demonstrated that up-regulation of the uPA system is correlated with malignancy of various carcinomas. Using both stable cell lines overexpressing uPAR and transient gene transfer, here we provide evidence for a non-reported role of uPAR in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, a process that has recently been termed efferocytosis. When uPAR was expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, hamster melanoma cells, or breast cancer cells (BCCs), there was a robust enhancement in the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells. uPAR-expressing cells failed to stimulate engulfment of viable cells, suggesting that uPAR enhances recognition of one or more determinant on the surface of the apoptotic cell. uPAR-mediated engulfment was not inhibited by expression of mutant beta5 integrin, nor was alphavbeta5 integrin-mediated engulfment modulated by cleavage of uPAR by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Further, we found that the more aggressive BCCs had a higher phagocytic capacity that correlated with uPAR expression and cleavage of membrane-associated uPAR in MDA-MB231 BCCs significantly impaired phagocytic activity. Because efferocytosis is critical for the resolution of inflammation and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, overexpression of uPAR in tumor cells may promote a tolerogenic microenvironment that favors tumor progression.",

Pure normal melanocytes and melanocytes of mixed cultures exhibited greater swelling of mitochondria with 10(-1) M C(9)2Na at 1 and 6 h, but the mitochondria of the malignant melanocytes were massively swollen with destruction of cristae. Plasma and nuclear membranes and membranes of rough endoplasmic reticulum were intact, but Golgi membranes exhibited vesiculation.

It has been shown as a marker in canine angiosarcoma; however, data on human mesenchymal tumors are limited. In this study, we examined claudin-5 in selected normal tissues, in 280 benign and malignant vascular tumors, and in 448 other epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuroectodermal tumors. Early human embryos showed limited claudin-5 expression in endothelia of large truncal vessels, in liver sinusoids, and in the epidermis. In adult human tissues, claudin-5 was widely present in the endothelia of vessels of different calibers. However, neovascular capillaries in carcinomas and other tumors were often negative. Claudin-5 was also present in many glandular and ductal epithelia, hair shafts, and glomerular podocytes. Capillary and cavernous hemangiomas and lymphangiomas generally showed endothelial positivity; however, many vessels, especially those with poorly formed lumina, were negative in juvenile capillary hemangiomas, and fewer vessels were highlighted in lobular capillary hemangiomas. Hemangioendotheliomas of retiform, kaposiform, epithelioid, and epithelioid sarcoma-like types showed positivity, the latter in a diffuse cytoplasmic manner. Most angiosarcomas (115 of 119) and Kaposi sarcomas (28 of 29) showed strong labeling, but rare cases only contained positive cytoplasmic dots. Claudin-5 was commonly present in carcinomas (except in sarcomatoid ones), but most tumors showed heterogenous labeling weaker than that in angiosarcomas. Seminomas and renal cell, hepatocellular, and signet ring cell carcinomas were negative. Among non-vascular mesenchymal tumors, biphasic synovial sarcoma was the only tumor to contain claudin-5-positive nonvascular elements. In hemangiopericytomas, glomus tumor, and melanomas, claudin-5 was expressed in endothelial cells only. Claudin-5 is a promising new marker for angiosarcomas and hemangioendotheliomas, but widespread expression in carcinomas and biphasic synovial sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis and addressed with the use of an antibody panel including keratins, especially the more epithelial-specific AE1/AE3 and epithelial membrane antigen.",

Tumor-derived exosomes contain MHC class I molecules and tumor-specific antigens, receiving attention as a potential cancer vaccine. For induction of efficient anti-tumor immunity, CD4+ helper T cells are required, which recognize appropriate MHC class II-peptide complexes. In this study, we have established an MHC class II molecule-expressing B16F1 murine melanoma cell line (B16F1- CIITA) by transduction of the CIITA (Class II transactivator) gene. Exosomes from B16-CII cells (CIITA- Exo) contained a high amount of MHC class II as well as a tumor antigen TRP2. When loaded on dendritic cells (DCs), CIITA-Exo induced the increased expression of MHC class II molecules and CD86 than the exosomes from the parental cells (Exo). In vitro assays using co-culture of immunized splenocytes and exosome-loaded DCs demonstrated that CIITA-Exo enhanced the splenocyte proliferation and IL-2 secretion. Consistently, compared to B16-Exo, CIITA-Exo induced the increased mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î±, chemokine receptor CCR7 and the production of Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12. A tumor preventive model showed that CIITA-Exo significantly inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Ex vivo assays using immunized mice demonstrated that CIITA-Exo induced a higher amount of Th1-polarized immune responses such as Th1-type IgG2a antibodies and IFN-Î³ cytokine as well as TRP2-specific CD8+ T cells. A tumor therapeutic model delayed effects of tumor growth by CIITA-Exo. These findings indicate that CIITA-Exo are more efficient as compared to parental Exo to induce anti-tumor immune responses, suggesting a potential role of MHC class II-containing tumor exosomes as an efficient cancer vaccine.",

(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12655-12660). In this study, the metabolism of ceramide released from sphingomyelin (SM) by bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) was examined using B16 cells and their GSL-deficient mutant counterpart GM95 cells. Treatment of B16 melanoma cells with bacterial SMase effectively hydrolyzed SM on the plasma membrane. Under these conditions, NeuAcalpha2,3Galbeta1, 4Glcbeta1,1ceramide was significantly increased. Interestingly, UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase-1 (GlcT-1) activity and GSL synthesis, but not SM synthesis or sphingosine generation, were found to be up-regulated by SMase treatment. The up-regulation of GSL synthesis seemed to occur at both the transcriptional and post-translational steps of GlcT-1 synthesis. Accumulation of ceramide by bacterial SMase was much higher in GM95 cells than in the parental cells. When the enzyme was removed from the culture medium, the intracellular ceramide level in B16 cells, but not that in the mutant cells, normalized. No rapid restoration of SM in either of the cell lines was observed after removal of the enzyme. SMase treatment strongly inhibited DNA synthesis in GM95 cells but not that in B16 cells. In the presence of D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor of GlcT-1, SMase treatment markedly increased the ceramide content and thus inhibited DNA synthesis in B16 cells. Our study provides the first evidence that GlcT-1 functions to regulate the level of intracellular ceramide by glycosylation of the ceramide when it is present in excess.",

In previous work we showed that a membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol (BA) could mimic the effects of heat stress and enhance heat shock protein synthesis in different mammalian cells. Here we explore heat- and BA-induced stress further by characterizing stress-induced membrane lipid changes in mouse melanoma B16 cells. Lipidomic fingerprints revealed that membrane stress achieved either by heat or BA resulted in pronounced and highly specific alterations in lipid metabolism. The loss in polyenes with the concomitant increase in saturated lipid species was shown to be a consequence of the activation of phopholipases (mainly phopholipase A(2) and C). A phospholipase C-diacylglycerol lipase-monoacylglycerol lipase pathway was identified in B16 cells and contributed significantly to the production of several lipid mediators upon stress including the potent heat shock modulator, arachidonic acid. The accumulation of cholesterol, ceramide and saturated phosphoglyceride species with raft-forming properties observed upon both heat and BA treatments of B16 cells may explain the condensation of ordered plasma membrane domains previously detected by fluorescence microscopy and may serve as a signalling platform in stress responses or as a primary defence mechanism against the noxious effects of stresses.",

To investigate this further nidogen 1- or 2-deficient mice were intravenously injected with B16 murine melanoma cells, and lung metastasis was analyzed. The authors could show that loss of nidogen 2, but not of nidogen 1, significantly promotes lung metastasis of melanoma cells. Histological and ultrastructural analysis of nidogen 1- and 2-deficient lungs did not reveal differences in morphology and ultrastructure of BMs, including vessel BMs. Furthermore, deposition and distribution of the major BM components were indistinguishable between the two mouse strains.

There are, however, many potent growth factors involved in tumor and blood vessel growth that bind to heparin with high affinity and their regulation by heparin may play a role in heparin's efficacy. We therefore chose to study the activity of a heparin analog, sucrose octasulfate (SOS), which has been similarly shown to interact with heparin-binding growth factors. Using mouse melanoma and lung carcinoma models, we demonstrate in vivo inhibition of tumor growth by SOS. SOS, however, showed little effect in coagulation assays indicating that this activity was not a primary mechanism of action for this molecule. Studies were then performed to assess the effect of SOS on basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) activity, a growth factor which promotes tumor and blood vessel growth and is produced by B16 melanoma cells. SOS potently inhibited FGF-2 binding to endothelial cells and stripped pre-bound FGF-2 from cells. SOS also regulated FGF-2 stimulated proliferation. Further, SOS facilitated FGF-2 diffusion through Descemet's membrane, a heparan sulfate-rich basement membrane from the cornea, suggesting a possible role in FGF-2 clearance.

C. Monboisse et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269: 25475-25482, 1994; J. Han et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272: 20395-20401, 1997). More recently, we demonstrated that native COL IV and -SNS-containing synthetic peptides (10 microg/ml) added to culture medium inhibit the proliferation of not only melanoma cells but also breast, pancreas, and stomach tumor cells up to 82% and prostate tumor cells by 15%. This inhibition was shown to be dependent on a COL IV- or peptide-induced increase in intracellular cAMP (T. A. Shahan et al., Connect. Tissue Res., 40: 221-232, 1999). Attempts to identify the putative receptor(s) on tumor cells led to the isolation of five proteins (Mr 33,000, 52,000, 72,000, 95,000, and 250,000) from melanoma and prostate cells by affinity purification with the alpha3(IV)179-208 peptide. The Mr 52,000, 95,000, and 250,000 proteins were shown to be CD47/integrin-associated protein(IAP), the integrin beta3 subunit, and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex, respectively. The Mr 33,000 and 72,000 proteins have not yet been identified. To confirm the specificity of ligand binding to the receptors, cell membranes from either melanoma or prostate tumor cells were pretreated with the unlabeled ligand alpha3(IV)187-191 (-YYSNS-); alternatively, the peptide was pretreated with a peptide-reactive monoclonal antibody (A5D7) before receptor isolation. These treatments inhibited the purification of CD47/IAP, the integrin beta3 subunit, and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex from tumor cells. Furthermore, cells treated with CD47/IAP- or the alpha(v)beta3 integrin-reactive antibodies prevented the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide from inhibiting cell proliferation and the subsequent rise in intracellular cAMP. Pretreating cells with the alpha3(IV)187-191 (-YYSNS-) peptide also inhibited their adhesion to the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide substrate, whereas the inactive alpha1(IV)185-203 peptide, from the same region of the alpha1 chain as the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide, had no effect. Incubation of cells with either CD47/IAP and/or alpha(v)beta3 integrin-reactive antibodies inhibited their adhesion to the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide, whereas antibodies to the beta1 and beta2 integrin subunits were without effect. These data suggest that ALC-COL IV, through its alpha3(IV) chain, inhibits tumor cell proliferation using the receptors CD47/IAP and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin.",

In this study we describe the combined contribution of these distinct enzyme systems to the invasive phenotype of a highly metastatic human melanoma cell line (M24met). M24met cells were found to secrete a spectrum of MMPs, including interstitial collagenase, type IV collagenases (M(r) 92,000 and 72,000 progelatinases), and stromelysin. Urokinase, but not tissue-type plasminogen activator, was detected in M24met-conditioned media and on cell surfaces. The contribution of these enzymes to extracellular matrix dissolution was determined by exploiting specific inhibitors, namely tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinases-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. Due to the coexpression of urokinase and MMP-dependent activity, M24met cells were observed to degrade multiple components of the extracellular matrix and to significantly degrade both interstitial and basement membrane matrices. Urokinase-dependent removal of matrix glycoprotein was observed to precede MMP-dependent collagenolysis as a prerequisite rate-limiting step. We present evidence which suggests that this temporal relationship is imposed by the structural architecture of the matrix such that matrix glycoprotein serves to protect associated collagen from MMP-dependent degradation. In addition to mediating significant collagenolysis, MMP activity was further implicated in the dissolution of matrix tropoelastin.

Agents known to promote differentiation, such as retinoic acid, butyrate, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, induce marked alterations in cell shape which are often accompanied by changes in cell functions. In this paper we study the effects of the differentiating polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on cytoskeleton, adhesion, and growth properties of cultured mouse B16 melanoma cells. DMSO induced a progressive reorganization of the cytoskeleton which was fully developed in 4 days of continuous exposure to the agent. DMSO-treated cells developed thick and regularly oriented microfilament bundles of the stress fiber type ending at vinculin-rich areas of focal contact between the ventral membrane and the substratum (interference reflection microscopy-dark adhesion plaques). Such a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton resulted in increased adhesion to the substratum and inhibition of cell growth in comparison to control untreated cells. Cells which became highly flattened and tightly adherent after exposure to DMSO for 4 days progressively reverted their phenotype to that of control untreated cells within 3 days of DMSO withdrawal. Namely, they lost stress fibers and adhesion plaques, became rounded and less adherent, and increased their growth rate. These results indicate that DMSO can change the transformed appearance of B16 mouse melanoma cells to a phenotype which is typical of a variety of nontransformed cells in culture.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Therapeutic induction of apoptosis is an important goal of anticancer drug design. Cellular carbonyl stress mediated by endogenous reactive carbonyl species (RCS) such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal (MG) affects proliferative signaling and metastasis of human tumor cells. Recent research suggests that RCS produced constitutively during increased tumor cell glycolysis may be antiapoptotic survival factors and thus represent a novel molecular target for anticancer intervention. Here, we demonstrate the tumor cell-specific apoptogenicity of carbonyl scavengers, which act by covalently trapping RCS, against human (A375, G361, and LOX) and murine (B16) melanoma cell lines. A structure-activity relationship study identified nucleophilic carbonyl scavenger pharmacophores as the functional determinants of apoptogenic antimelanoma activity of structurally diverse agents such as 3,3-dimethyl-D-cysteine and aminoguanidine. Previous work has demonstrated that covalent adduction of protein-arginine residues in the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore and heat shock protein 27 by intracellular MG produced in tumor cell glycolysis inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis and enhances cancer cell survival. Indeed, in various melanoma cell lines, carbonyl scavenger-induced apoptosis was antagonized by pretreatment with the membrane-permeable RCS phenylglyoxal (PG). Carbonyl scavenger-induced apoptosis was associated with early loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and cyclosporin A antagonized the effects of carbonyl scavengers, suggesting a causative role of MPT pore opening in carbonyl scavenger apoptogenicity. Consistent with RCS inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis in melanoma cells, staurosporine-induced apoptosis also was suppressed by PG pretreatment. Our results suggest that carbonyl scavengers acting as direct molecular antagonists of RCS are promising apoptogenic prototype agents for antimelanoma drug design.",

Liposome uptake by the cells was quantitated using radioactive lipids and liposome-entrapped drugs under various conditions. Liposomes containing P0 protein and [14C]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:cholesterol (10:1 molar ratio) had an interaction rate with M21 cells three times higher than control vesicles of the same lipid composition but without the protein after incubation at 37 or 4 degrees C. The presence of P0 protein could be detected on the surface of melanoma cells by immunofluorescence after incubation. Binding to the cell surface and endocytosis of P0 liposomes was suggested from the sensitivity of cell-associated proteoliposomes to trypsin, metabolic inhibitors, and low temperature. Liposomal encapsulation highly increased the association of model compounds [( 3H]methotrexate and [3H]inulin) with cells. The proteoliposomes appeared to be leaky in the incubation medium, which led to the delivery of a lower amount of drug into cells than could be expected from their initial drug content. The results suggest that the attachment of liposomes to the cell surface can increase their drug delivery potential, because the binding triggers endocytic processes or a juxtapositional temporary permeability increase of liposome and cellular membrane that can lead to the uptake of drug from liposomes.",

Results of cell surface radioimmunoassay and absorption analysis demonstrated that 81C6 defined a glioma-mesenchymal extracellular matrix (GMEM) antigen expressed by 14 of 16 gliomas, 1 of 3 neuroblastomas, 1 of 7 melanomas, 2 of 6 sarcoma cell lines, and 8 of 9 cultured fibroblast lines.

Within the central nervous system, GMEM was expressed in 10 of 11 glioblastomas but was undetected in 5 of 6 astrocytomas and in normal adult and fetal brain by peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistology. In glioblastomas, the GMEM antigen was localized to basement membranes of the distinctive glomeruloid endothelial proliferations and hyperplastic blood vessels. The GMEM antigen was also expressed in 3 of 3 glioblastoma cell lines and 6 of 8 glioblastoma biopsy xenografts in athymic nude mice. Among non-central nervous system tissues and tumors, GMEM was found by peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistology in normal liver sinusoids, spleen red pulp sinusoids, kidney medullary tubule interstitium, and glomerular mesangium and in association with vascular and stromal elements of several undifferentiated tumors. The GMEM antigen is distinct from previously described forms of fibronectin, laminin, collagen types I to V, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and heparin, as determined by absorption analysis and immunohistological localization in tissues. The expression of GMEM in glioblastoma but not normal brain, association with glioblastoma-proliferative endothelium basement membranes, and expression in glioblastoma cell lines and nude mouse xenografts suggest that GMEM may be a useful marker of gliomas in vivo and in vitro.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In this study we provide evidence that the low expression of IGF-1R at the cell surface of estrogen-independent breast cancer cells is due to a low rate of de novo synthesis of dolichyl phosphate. The analyses were performed on the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell line MDA231 and, in comparison, the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2, which expresses a high number of plasma membrane-bound IGF-1R. Whereas the MDA231 cells had little or no surface expression of IGF-1R, they expressed functional (i.e., ligand-binding) intracellular receptors. By measuring the incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into dolichyl phosphate, we could demonstrate that the rate of dolichyl phosphate synthesis was considerably lower in MDA231 cells than in SK-MEL-2 cells. Furthermore, N-linked glycosylation of the alpha-subunit of IGF-1R was 8-fold higher in the melanoma cells. Following addition of dolichyl phosphate to MDA231 cells, N-linked glycosylation of IGF-1R was drastically increased, which in turn was correlated to a substantial translocation of IGF-1R to the plasma membrane, as assayed by IGF-1 binding analysis and by Western blotting of plasma membrane proteins. The dolichyl phosphate-stimulated receptors were proven to be biochemically active since they exhibited autophosphorylation. Under normal conditions MDA231 cells, expressing very few IGF-1R at the cell surface, were not growth-arrested by an antibody (alphaIR-3) blocking the binding of IGF-1 to IGF-1R. However, after treatment with dolichyl phosphate, leading to a high cell surface expression of IGF-1R, alphaIR-3 efficiently blocked MDA231 cell growth. Taken together with the fact that the breast cancer cells produce IGF-1 and exhibit intracellular binding, our data suggest that the level of de novo -synthesized dolichyl phosphate may be critical for whether the cells will use an intracellular or an extracellular autocrine IGF-1 pathway.",

Using a human melanoma model, we have previously shown that this receptor was coordinately expressed with the receptor for the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPAR). In our present study, the link between these receptors was further investigated by assessing the effect of alphavbeta3 ligation on uPAR transcription and function. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we found that receptor ligation by immobilized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) induced a rapid increase (up to 4.5 fold) in uPAR mRNA levels, which was maximal 4 hr after cell attachment. An increase was also noted in plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) mRNA levels (2.7-fold), but none was noted in uPA levels. In addition, ligation of alphavbeta3 resulted in a significant increase in cell surface-associated plasmin levels, which coincided with a 2- to 3-fold increase in cell invasion as measured in the Matrigel invasion assay. This increase in invasion could in turn be abolished by antibodies directed to uPA and uPAR and by the plasmin inhibitors epsilon-aminocaproic acid and aprotinin. Furthermore, ligation of the integrin alphavbeta3 triggered a rapid increase of up to 12-fold in total cellular PKC activity, and this coincided with the redistribution of PKCbeta, but not PKCalpha, from the cytosol to the membrane. Treatment of the cells with the PKCbeta-specific inhibitor LY379196 blocked uPAR and PAI-1 mRNA induction and reduced the increase in cell invasion due to alphavbeta3 ligation, confirming the involvement of this isoform in the response. The results provide evidence that the vitronectin receptor can enhance invasion by regulating the uPAR/uPA/plasmin system of proteolysis and implicate PKCbeta as an intermediate in the activation pathway.",

The cell lines used were +SA and -SA mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells, RT7-4bs and RT7-4b-Ls rat hepatocarcinoma cells, and B16-F1 and B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells. In general, imperfect correlations of lytic activity with metastatic ability were found for the purified substrate digestions, but, for each pair of variants, the more metastatic tumor cell line was always able to solubilize more surface-bound isotope from the lens capsule. Visual evidence of tumor cell-associated digestion of lens capsule basement membrane was obtained using transmission electron microscopy. Mouse mammary carcinoma cells attached more rapidly to lens capsule than to endothelial cell monolayers or tissue culture plastic. We next added endothelial cells to the model substrate. Aortic endothelial cells grew well on lens capsules without apparent synthesis of additional basement membrane matrix. In additional studies, the lens capsule was used in a chamber apparatus to demonstrate that cellular invasion of the full thickness of this basement membrane structure could be demonstrated and readily quantitated. Our results indicate that bovine lens capsule is a particularly versatile basement membrane structure useful for studies of tumor cell invasion and extravasation. In addition, the comparison of purified substrate digestions with lens capsule matrix digestion indicates the desirability of also using a matrix digest when correlating lytic abilities of tumor cells with their metastatic abilities.",

Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT colorimetric assay. Details of metastatic capabilities including invasion, migration and adhesion of B16F10 melanoma cells were examined by Boyden Chamber invasion and migration, scratch motility and cell attachment assays, respectively. The results demonstrated that n-hexane and chloroform extracts exhibited potent anti-proliferative effects (p<0.01), whereas the methanol and aqueous extracts had less pronounced effects after 24 h exposure. Bioactivity-guided chromatographic fractionation of both active n-hexane and chloroform extracts led to the isolation of two main prenylated xanthones and characterization as macluraxanthone and gerontoxanthone-I, respectively, their structures being identified by comparison with the spectral data. Interestingly, both exhibited potent effective effects. At non-toxic effective doses, n-hexane and chloroform extracts (10 and 30 Î¼g/ml) as well as macluraxanthone and gerontoxanthone-I (3 and 10 Î¼M) significantly inhibited B16F10 cell invasion, to a greater extent than 10 Î¼M doxorubicin, while reducing migration of cancer cells without cellular cytotoxicity. Moreover, exposure of B16F10 melanoma cells to high concentrations of chloroform (30 Î¼g/ml) and geratoxanthone-I (20 Î¼M) for 24 h resulted in delayed adhesion and retarded colonization. As insights into mechanisms of action, typical morphological changes of apoptotic cells e.g. membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, apoptotic bodies and loss of adhesion as well as cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase with increase of sub-G1 cell proportions, detected by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry were observed, suggesting DNA damage and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Taken together, our findings indicate for the first time that active n-hexane and chloroform extracts as well as macluraxanthone and gerontoxanthone-I isolated from Maclura amboinensis Bl. roots affect multistep of cancer metastasis processes including proliferation, adhesion, invasion and migration, possibly through induction of apoptosis of highly metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells. Based on these data, M. amboinensis Bl. represents a potential candidate novel chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agent. Additionally, they also support its ethno-medicinal usage for cancer prevention and/or chemotherapy.",

In the present study, we investigated the oncolytic activity of LTX-315 in human melanoma cells (A375). LTX-315 induced a rapid plasma membrane disruption and cell death within 2 hours. At a low concentration, fluorescence-labeled LTX-315 was internalized and accumulated in cytoplasmic vacuoles in close proximity to the mitochondria. The mitochondrial membrane potential was shown to depolarize as a consequence of LTX-315 treatment and at ultrastructural level, the mitochondria morphology was significantly altered. Release of danger signals (DAMPs) such as ATP, Cytochrome C and HMGB1 into the cell supernatant of cultured cells was evident minutes after peptide treatment. The oncolytic effect of LTX-315 involving perturbation of both the cell membrane and the mitochondria with subsequent release of DAMPs may highlight the ability of LTX-315 to induce complete regression and long-term protective immune responses as previously reported in experimental animal models.",

Augmented antigen sensitivity to the virus-modified extracts compared with virus alone or to the unmodified extracts was observed in all patient groups. There was insufficient specificity to delineate a response by individual tumor type and related tumor extract, but some of the observed responses suggested tumor or organ site associations. Cervical carcinoma patients reacted more frequently to the virus-modified cervix extract, which also produced a high frequency of response in patients with ovarian carcinoma and melanoma. Ovarian carcinoma patients demonstrated increased sensitivity to both virus-modified ovarian carcinoma extracts, although 14 of 21 patients also showed responsiveness to one of the unmodified ovarian extracts. Malignant melanoma patients showed increased sensitivity to all virus-modified extracts except one of two derived from the ovarian carcinoma, and demonstrated a significantly augmented response to the virus-modified melanoma extract when the response to this extract was compared with that in ovarian carcinoma patients. The augmented reactions appear to be due to an association of the PR8 virus and as yet undetermined cellular components rather than to the virus alone.

NM78-AM cells were spherical, grew in suspension as clusters, and produced no melanin. In contrast, NM78-MM cells were adherent and produced melanin granules. Initially, NM78-AM cells were grown on fibroblast feeder cells or in growth media supplemented with 10% conditioned medium from fibroblasts, but eventually grew in standard growth media alone. NM78-AM cells had interdigitating microvilli and formed cell clusters. They had large nucleoli, desmosomes, lipid droplets, and well-developed Golgi apparatuses. In contrast, NM78-MM cells grew as adherent neuron-like cells. They had large prominent nucleoli, irregular nuclear membranes, a number of mitochondria, well-developed Golgi apparatuses, melanosomes at various stages of development in the cytoplasm, and the cells secreted melanin granules. Projections from these melanotic cells formed anastomoses with each other. NM78-MM cells stained immunofluorescently for internexin, neuron specific enolase, NF-200, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These cells were severely aneuploid, approximating to triploidy, and had many marker chromosomes. We used a real-time monitoring system to evaluate oxygen concentrations in culture medium to investigate the susceptibility of both cell lines to various anti-cancer drugs. NM78-AM cells were slightly sensitive to actinomycin D, but not to cisplatin, irinotecan, the irinotecan metabolite SN-38, taxol, taxotere, bleomycin and methotrexate; NM78-MM cells were sensitive to cisplatin, and not to taxol, taxotere, carboplatin, and irinotecan.

The metabolites formed by BSAO and spermine are more toxic than exogenous H2O2 and acrolein, even though their concentration is lower during the initial phase of incubation due to their more gradual release than the exogenous products. Both wild-type and MDR cells, after pre-treatment with MDL 72527, an inactivator of polyamine oxidase and a lysosomotropic compound, show to be sensitized to subsequent exposure to BSAO/spermine. Evidence of ultrastructural aberrations and acridine orange release from lysosomes is presented in this work that is in favor of the permeabilization of the lysosomal membrane as the major cause of sensitization by MDL 72527. Owing to its lysosomotropic effect, pre-treatment with MDL 72527 amplifies the ability of the metabolites formed from spermine by oxidative deamination to induce cell death.

        "Doc_abstract":"This study describes a novel cancer immunotherapy treatment that exploits the natural anti-Gal Ab to destroy tumor lesions and convert them into an endogenous vaccine targeted to APC via FcgammaR. Anti-Gal constitutes 1% of immunoglobulins in humans and interacts specifically with alpha-gal epitopes (Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-R). The binding of anti-Gal to alpha-gal epitopes on pig cells mediates xenograft rejection. The proposed method uses glycolipid micelles with multiple alpha-gal epitopes (alpha-gal glycolipids). These glycolipids are extracted from rabbit red cell membranes and are comprised of ceramides with carbohydrate chains containing 5-25 carbohydrates, all capped with alpha-gal epitopes. Efficacy of this treatment was demonstrated in alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout mice producing anti-Gal and bearing B16 melanoma or B16/OVA producing OVA as a surrogate tumor Ag. These mice are unique among nonprimate mammals in that, similar to humans, they lack alpha-gal epitopes and can produce the anti-Gal Ab. Intratumoral injection of alpha-gal glycolipids results in local inflammation mediated by anti-Gal binding to the multiple alpha-gal epitopes and activation of complement. These glycolipids spontaneously insert into tumor cell membranes. The binding of anti-Gal to alpha-gal expressing tumor cells induces the destruction of treated lesions as in anti-Gal-mediated xenograft rejection. Anti-Gal further opsonizes tumor cells within the lesion and, thus, targets them for effective uptake by APC that transport the tumor Ags to draining lymph nodes. APC further cross-present immunogenic tumor Ag peptides and elicit a systemic anti-tumor immune response. Similar intratumoral injection of alpha-gal glycolipids in humans is likely to induce the destruction of treated lesions and elicit a protective immune response against micrometastases.",

We report the identification of a human laminin binding protein with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels that was found, after purification and amino acid microsequencing, to be identical to the previously described 14-kDa galactoside binding soluble L-14 lectin. We have designated this human laminin binding protein as HLBP14. HLBP14 was purified from human melanoma cells in culture by laminin affinity chromatography and gel electroelution. We demonstrate that HLBP14 binds specifically to the poly-N-acetyllactosamine residues of murine laminin and does not bind to other glycoproteins that do not contain such structures, such as fibronectin. HLBP14 was eluted from a murine laminin column by lactose, N-acetyllactosamine, and galactose but not by other control saccharides, including glucose, fucose, mannose, and melibiose. It did not bind to laminin treated with endo-beta-galactosidase. Lactose also eluted HLBP14 off a human laminin affinity column, implying that human laminin also contains poly-N-acetyllactosamine residues. On immunoblots, polyclonal antibodies raised against HLBP14 recognized HLBP14 as well as 31- and 67-kDa molecules that are also laminin binding proteins, indicating that these proteins share common epitopes. L-14, a dimeric lactose binding lectin, is expressed in a wide variety of tissues. Although the expression of this molecule has been linked to a variety of biological events, the elucidation of its specific functions has been elusive. The observation that HLBP14, a human cancer cell laminin binding protein, is identical to L-14 strongly suggests that the functions attributed to this lectin could be mediated, at least in part, through its ability to interact with the poly-N-acetyllactosamine residues of laminin. HLBP14 could potentially play a role during tumor invasion and metastasis by modulating the interactions between cancer cells and laminin.",

The invasion of human metastatic tumor cells (SN12M renal-cell carcinoma, HT1080 fibrosarcoma and A375M melanoma) into Matrigel-coated filters was inhibited by an anti-CD13 MAb, WM15, in a concentration-dependent manner. However, this MAb did not have any effect on tumor-cell adhesion and migration to the extracellular matrices, which may be involved in tumor-cell invasion. MAb WM15 inhibited the degradation of type-IV collagen by tumor cells in a concentration-dependent manner. We also found that WM15 inhibited hydrolysing activities towards substrates of aminopeptidases in 3 different tumor cells. Since our previous study indicated that bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, was able to inhibit tumor-cell invasion, as well as aminopeptidase activities of murine and human metastatic tumor cells, cell-surface amino-peptidase N/CD13 may be partly involved in the activation mechanism for type-IV collagenolysis to achieve tumor-cell invasion, and anti-CD13 MAb WM15 may inhibit tumor-cell invasion through a mechanism involving its inhibitory action on the aminopeptidase N in tumor cells.",

HEA125 labeled most epithelial cell types throughout the body but did not label any nonepithelial tissue. Major exceptions were epidermal keratinocytes, gastric parietal cells, hepatocytes, thymic cortical epithelial, and myoepithelial cells. Normal mesothelial cells were unreactive. In normal glandular epithelia and tubular adenocarcinomas exclusively the basolateral cell membranes were stained. HEA125 intensely reacted with all tested carcinoma specimens derived from colorectum, stomach, pancreas, liver, lung, mammary gland, ovary, thyroid, kidney, urinary bladder, and prostate including a number of anaplastic, diffusely infiltrating carcinomas. Metastatic lesions of these tumors were consistently positive. Generally, the staining of tumor cells was very homogeneous. The majority of squamous cell carcinomas were less strongly labeled than adenocarcinomas; keratinizing areas of the tumor masses were negative. Germ cell tumors and mesotheliomas of epithelioid type focally expressed the antigen. Egp34 was found to be absent from sarcomas, lymphomas, melanomas, and neurogenic tumors. Hence, HEA125 is a useful reagent for the distinction of carcinomas from nonepithelial neoplasms, even at very low degrees of histological differentiation.

This receptor is expressed in endothelial cells and in some vascular tumors, but many reports also detail its expression in carcinomas and lymphomas. VEGFR2 is a potential cell-type marker, and data on VEGFR2 expression may also have therapeutic significance in view of recent availability of VEGFR2 inhibitors. In this study, we immunohistochemically examined 262 vascular endothelial and 1640 nonvascular tumors and selected non-neoplastic tissues with a VEGFR2-specific rabbit monoclonal antibody 55B11. In early human embryo, VEFGR2 was expressed in endothelia of developing capillaries and in the thoracic duct, great vessels, hepatic sinusoids, epidermis, and mesothelia. In late first trimester fetus peripheral soft tissues, VEGFR2 was restricted to capillary endothelia, chondrocytes, and superficial portion of the epidermis. In normal adult tissues, it was restricted to endothelia and mesothelia. VEGFR2 was consistently expressed in angiosarcomas, Kaposi sarcomas, and retiform hemangioendotheliomas. It was detected in only half of epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (15/27), usually focally. VEGFR2 was strongly expressed in most capillary hemangiomas and weakly or focally in cavernous, venous, and spindle cell hemangiomas and in lymphangiomas. Malignant epithelial mesothelioma was found to be a unique epithelial neoplasm with a strong and nearly consistent VEGFR2 expression, including membrane staining (35/38). Approximately 10% of squamous cell carcinomas and 23% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas contained focal positivity. The only nonendothelial mesenchymal tumors found to be VEGFR2 positive were biphasic synovial sarcoma (focal epithelial expression) and chordoma. All melanomas and lymphomas were negative. VEGFR2 is a promising marker for malignant vascular tumors and malignant epithelioid mesothelioma. Expression in biphasic synovial sarcoma epithelium, chordoma, and some carcinomas has to be considered in differential diagnosis. Information on VEGFR2 tissue expression may be useful in development of targeted oncologic therapy through VEGFR2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

A number of genes involved in melanocyte development and vertebrate pigmentation have been characterized, largely through studies of a diversity of pigment mutations in a variety of species. Embryonic development of the melanocyte initiates with cell fate specification in the neural crest, which is then followed by cell migration and niche localization. Many genes involved in melanocyte development have also been implicated in the development of melanoma, an aggressive and fatal form of skin cancer that originates in the melanocyte. Although early stage melanomas that have not spread to the lymph nodes can be excised with little risk of recurrence, patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma have a high mortality rate due to the resistance of most tumors to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Transformed melanocytes that develop into melanomas proliferate abnormally and often begin to grow radially in the skin. Vertical growth can then follow this radial growth, leading to an invasion through the basement membrane into the underlying dermis and subsequent metastasis. It is still unclear, however, how a normal melanocyte becomes a melanoma cell, and how melanoma utilizes the properties of the normal melanocyte and its progenitors in its progression. The goal of this mini-review is to highlight the role of melanocyte developmental pathways in melanoma, and to discuss recent studies and tools being used to illuminate this connection.",

Various membrane associated proteases localized on the invadopodial membranes are responsible for the extracellular matrix degradation. Work from our laboratory shows that secreted proteases including Gelatinase A, and high molecular weight integral membrane proteases are associated with cell surface invadopodia. Three cell types, including chicken embryonic cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus, human malignant melanoma cell line LOX, and human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231, retain the invasive phenotype in vitro, express invadopodia, degrade and enter into a fibronectin-rich collagenous matrix. We suggest that invadopodium-associated proteases are ideal targets for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer as their presence in association with primary tumors may signal increased metastatic potential. An approach toward the development of new prognostic markers for breast malignancy involved production of monoclonal antibodies directed against membrane proteases in a mixture of glycoproteins. Double immunofluorescent technique using a known invadopodium marker is designed to select specific monoclonal antibodies colocalizing at the invasion front, on invadopodia of cancer cells. Membrane protease accessibility at the cell surface can therefore be exploited for therapeutic advances by the development of specific antibodies and inhibitors that block their activities, and by the use of monoclonal antibodies to target cytotoxic molecules to micrometastases. Also, this same accessibility may potentially be used to detect surface proteases on micrometastases or to detect components shed by micrometastases in serum.",

Studies have shown EGF and SGF to be two distinct growth factors despite the fact that SGF exerts its effects by specifically interacting with EGF receptors. Addition of SGF to normal indicator cells results in expression of the transformed phenotype. The effects of SGF are reversible; the cells resume their normal growth pattern when the growth factor is removed. Three different human tumor cell lines in culture, a rhabdomyosarcoma, a bronchogenic carcinoma, and a metastatic melanoma, release TGFs that also confer the transformed phenotype on normal fibroblasts.

As shown in earlier studies, nevi show important morphological and phenotypical changes in response to ultraviolet light (UVB) irradiation.;To clarify the role of MMP-2, TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP in UVB-irradiated vs. non-irradiated melanocytic nevi.;Immunohistochemical comparison of the MMP-2, TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression pattern.;MMP-2 is expressed by lesional keratinocytes and its expression is up-regulated by UVB-irradiation. MMP-2 expression was not observed in melanocytic cells. TIMP-2, by contrast, is predominantly expressed by melanocytic nevus cells, and its expression is in part down-regulated by UVB-irradiation. MT1-MMP is expressed by basal keratinocytes and to a weaker extent by melanocytic nevus cells.;MMP-2 expression by keratinocytes in nevi probably represents the result of activation of keratinocyte turnover in lesional epidermis. MMP-2 could play a role in the downward movement of junctional nevus cells into the dermis. The reduction of TIMP-2 expression in melanocytic cells by UV-light together with the enhanced expression of MMP-2 in the adjacent epidermis may promote basement membrane degradation. The expression pattern of MT1-MMP in close proximity to epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces underlines the synergistic role of MT1-MMP in this process.",

Actually, 8 Gy-irradiated or L-Dopa (2 X 10(-4) M)-treated cultures finally reached the cell number and cell density of controls. However, a combination of a single dose of radiation (8 Gy) followed by L-Dopa (2 X 10(-4) M)-treatment resulted in destruction of all cells. Melanin formation was stimulated by L-dopa-treatment or X-irradiation, and was further elevated by the combined application of radiation and L-Dopa-exposure. Whether the effects of exogenously applied L-Dopa, an intermediary metabolite of melanin synthesis, are due to the conversion to growth-inhibitory metabolites (quinones, radicals, etc.) inside or outside the cell, was discussed. The latter might result from release (due to membrane damage or cell disintegration) of tyrosinase or/and melanosomes into the culture medium with the consequence of extracellular synthesis of potentially cytotoxic metabolites from medium substrates. Further, endocytosis of exogenous melanosomes and tyrosinase with potentially harmful effects is feasible. An application of such a combination therapy of melanoma to clinical medicine should be considered.",

Our previous studies have shown that Muc4 interacts with and potentiates signaling by the ErbB2 (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase through an epidermal growth factor-like domain in its extracellular region. Here, we show that expression of Muc4 in human A375 melanoma cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells confers resistance to apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including chemotherapeutic agents, the absence of serum factors, and the loss of cellular adhesion. Mapping experiments revealed that the O-glycosylation and cytosolic domains of Muc4 are dispensable for its antiapoptotic activity, and are also dispensable for the potentiation of signaling by ErbB2. Knockdown of endogenous Muc4 in JIMT-1 breast cancer cells sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli, and this can be rescued by Muc4 forms lacking the O-glycosylation or cytosolic domains. Surprisingly, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Muc4 antiapoptotic activity vary among cell lines. Although Muc4 in JIMT-1 cells engages ErbB2 to promote cell survival, its antiapoptotic mechanism in MCF7 and A375 cells seems to be independent of ErbB2. However, Muc4 expression in all cell lines culminates in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the proapoptotic protein Bad and the elevation of the prosurvival protein Bcl-xL. Our observations suggest that tumor cells can exploit the versatile antiapoptotic activities of Muc4 to acquire resistance to therapeutic agents, and augment cell survival after the loss of adhesion and microenvironment-derived survival factors.",

All eyes were enucleated: one eye the day after TTT, two eyes 2 days after TTT, and one eye 6 weeks after TTT. Immediately after enucleation the eyes were immersed in standard Karnovsky's fixative with cocodylate buffer and prepared for light and electron microscopy. In the treated area of all four melanomas we found a dense band of necrotic tissue (zone A) consisting of an amorphous mass of dead cells sharply demarcated from the rest of the neoplastic tissue. Next to this zone was a more eosinophilic and also sharply demarcated band (zone B) that consisted of similar but less intensive changes. In the next band (zone C), marked injury to the cellular membrane and subcellular structures were seen on electron microscopy. The next band (zone D) consisted of changes mainly observed only within the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells and significantly less intensive than those in zone C. Outside zone D tumour cells that were normal in appearance were seen. No scleral alterations induced by heat were found.

This effect peaked 3 days after injection of TFF and was abrogated by heating the TFF to 70 degrees C for 1 h. The injection of TFF was also able to induce macrophage spreading in nude mice. Injection of viable B16 cells induced spreading, as would be predicted if TFF is produced by B16 cells in vivo. In vitro incubation of peritoneal cells with TFF was also able to induce macrophage spreading. Finally, subcutaneous injection of TFF reduced by 80% the accumulation of peritoneal cells in response to intraperitoneal injection of phytohemagglutinin.

Cells which are adherent to laminin are more malignant than the non-adherent cells and in certain tumor cells, the number of laminin receptors is positively correlated with malignancy. Laminin also increases collagenase IV activity, an enzyme demonstrated to be critical for tumor spread. A site on laminin, containing the amino acid sequence SIKVAV, has been identified which when injected intravenously with B16F10 melanoma cells, causes an increase in the number of colonies on the surface of the lungs. This peptide does not affect tumor cell arrest in the vasculature or the immune system. It does promote angiogenesis in various in vitro and in vivo models, thereby facilitating tumor cell survival. When a complex mixture of laminin-enriched basement membrane components (Matrigel) is coinjected with tumor cells subcutaneously, tumor incidence and growth increases. Various tumor cell lines and primary isolates, which previously could not form tumors in mice, can be induced to grow rapidly in the presence of Matrigel. Slowly growing tumors or arrested tumors can also be induced to grow more quickly with additional injections of Matrigel. When an SIKVAV-containing synthetic peptide is coinjected with B16F10 tumor cells and Matrigel subcutaneously in mice, larger tumors are formed than that observed with either Matrigel or cells alone.

In tumors, a polarized M2 phenotype called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are associated with promotion of invasion and angiogenesis. In cancer cells, vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multi-subunit enzyme, is expressed on the plasma/vesicular membranes and critically influences the metastatic behavior. In addition, the soluble, cleaved N-terminal domain of a2 isoform of V-ATPase (a2NTD) is associated with in vitro induction of pro-tumorigenic properties in monocytes. This activity of a2 isoform of V-ATPase (a2V) caused us to investigate its role in cancer progression through the evaluation of the immunomodulatory properties of a2NTD. Here, we present direct evidence that surface expression of V-ATPase is associated with macrophage polarization in tumor tissue. Macrophages from BALB/c mice (peritoneal/bone marrow derived) were stimulated with recombinant a2NTD in both ex vivo and in vivo systems and evaluated for TAM characteristics. a2V was highly expressed in tumor tissues (breast and skin) as well as on the surface of tumor cell lines. The a2NTD-stimulated macrophages (a2MÎ¦) acquired TAM phenotype, which was characterized by elevated expression of mannose receptor-1, Arginase-1, interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-Î². a2MÎ¦ also exhibited increased production of other tumorigenic factors including matrix metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Further, a2MÎ¦ were cocultured with mouse B-16F0 melanoma cells for their functional characterization. The coculture of these a2MÎ¦ subsequently increased the invasion and angiogenesis of less invasive B-16F0 cells. When cocultured with naive T cells, a2MÎ¦ significantly inhibited T-cell activation. The present data establish the role of V-ATPase in modulating a macrophage phenotype towards TAMs through the action of a2NTD, suggesting it to be a potential therapeutic target in cancer. ",

NKLAM is rapidly synthesized and then targeted to the granule membranes of NK cells upon NK activation. Previous studies have shown an essential role for NKLAM in NK killing activity in vitro. These findings were extended to an in vivo model of NK-mediated tumor killing in which NKLAM-deficient knockout (KO) mice injected with B16 melanoma cells were found to have significantly higher numbers of pulmonary tumor nodules than wild-type (WT) mice. To further investigate the role of NKLAM and NK function in tumor immunity in vivo, we utilized additional tumor models to compare tumor development and progression in NKLAM KO and WT mice. Primary tumor growth, dissemination, and metastasis of RMA-S lymphoma cells and E0771 breast cancer cells were evaluated. Both tumor cell lines were stably transfected with constructs that allow expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), which serves as a tumor-specific marker. Intravenous injection of NK-sensitive RMA-S lymphoma cells resulted in greater dissemination of lymphoma cells in NKLAM KO mice than in WT mice. Lymphoma cells were found in the lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM) of NKLAM KO mice 2 weeks after injection; few detectable tumor cells remained in WT mice. E0771 syngeneic breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary pads of NKLAM KO and WT mice. Primary tumor growth was greater in NKLAM KO than in WT mice. More significantly, there were 4-5-fold more tumor cells in the blood and lungs of NKLAM KO than in WT mice 2 weeks after injection of tumor cells into the mammary pad. These results indicate that NKLAM plays a role in tumor development in vivo, especially in controlling tumor dissemination and metastasis to distant sites.",

Comparison of the two antibodies demonstrates similar induction in vitro of splenocyte proliferation and cytolytic activity. Both BAT and anti-CD3 antibodies manifest anti-tumor activity in mice bearing B16 melanoma. They differ however in the timing of antibody administration post-tumor inoculation which is most effective in eliciting the anti-tumor effect. Whereas BAT is most effective when administered 10 to 14 days post-tumor inoculation, anti-CD3 is effective at an early time.

Laminin (at concentrations of 4-8 micrograms/ml) added to serum-free culture supernatants of subconfluent A2058 human melanoma cells significantly increased the release of the type IV collagenolytic activity (200-300%). The induction of type IV collagenase was more pronounced (580%) using a fragment of laminin which binds to the cell surface laminin receptor. A monoclonal antibody against the human laminin receptor blocked the effect of laminin on type IV collagenase, suggesting that occupation of the laminin receptor may be necessary for the effect. Increase in the type IV collagenolytic activity mediated by laminin was also demonstrated in two other malignant cell lines, HT fibrosarcoma (168%) and mouse melanoma (B16-F10) (271%). The increase in type IV collagenase was found to be specific for laminin because another cell-binding matrix protein, fibronectin, did not have any effect, and epidermal growth factor and transferrin actually decreased the type IV collagenase in human melanoma culture medium (epidermal growth factor, 50% at 20 ng/ml; and transferrin, 20% at 10 micrograms/ml).

Using a panel of specific G-protein antibodies, we identified Gi alpha 2 as the PT-sensitive G-protein uniquely abundant in highly invasive cells. In addition, RNA hybridization results confirm the immunoblot observations that Gi alpha 2 is present at higher levels in strongly invasive cells. This result suggests that the elevated expression of Gi alpha 2 in highly invasive cells is not entirely due to differences in either translational efficiency or protein degradation but is related to altered RNA transcriptional initiation, processing and/or degradation. ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha-subunits by PT inhibited the fibronectin, laminin and collagen type-IV-stimulated motility of the 2 highly invasive clones, while PT treatment of cells from a poorly invasive clone resulted in little or no reduction of the fibronectin, laminin or collagen type-IV-stimulated lower motility. Furthermore, PT treatment of highly or poorly invasive K1735 clones does not result in any alteration in cellular cAMP accumulation, suggesting that the PT substrate is not linked with the adenylyl cyclase enzyme complex. The data suggest that a PT-sensitive G-protein, probably Gi alpha 2 regulates second messenger pathways that contribute to elevated motility in highly invasive K1735 cells.",

Adhesion of murine B16 amelanotic melanoma cells (B16a) to murine microvascular endothelial cells (CD3) was enhanced, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, by pretreating CD3 cells with 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid [i.e., 12(S)-HETE], a 12-lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid. The metabolic precursor of 12(S)-HETE, 12-HPETE (12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid) also enhanced B16a cell adhesion to CD3 monolayers, whereas other lipoxygenase products, i.e., 5(S), 11(S), and 15(S)-HETEs were ineffective. 12(S)-HETE-enhanced tumor cell adhesion was blocked by treating endothelial cells with antibodies against the alpha v beta 3 complex or against individual subunits but not with antibodies against alpha 5 beta 1. In contrast, neither of these two integrins appeared to be involved in tumor cell adhesion to unstimulated endothelium. Flow cytometric analysis, immunofluorescent labeling, and image analysis indicated that 12(S)-HETE induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in the surface expression of alpha v beta 3 but not alpha 5 beta 1 on CD3 cells. The increased surface expression of alpha v beta 3 on endothelial cells did not result from an increased transcription or translation of alpha v beta 3 message as confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blotting, and quantitative Western blotting. Instead, subcellular fractionation studies revealed an increased translocation of alpha v beta 3 integrins from the cytosolic pool to the membrane fractions. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with several cytoskeleton-disrupting agents (i.e., cycloheximide or acrylamide to disrupt intermediate filament vimentin, cytochalasin D to disrupt microfilaments, colchicine or Nocodazole to disrupt microtubules) abolished the 12(S)-HETE-enhanced alpha v beta 3 surface expression as well as tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells. Also, pretreatment of CD3 cells with protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C, but not with protein kinase A inhibitor H8, blocked 12(S)-HETE-enhanced alpha v beta 3 surface expression and tumor cell adhesion. Collectively, these results suggest that eicosanoid 12(S)-HETE modulates tumor cell interaction with endothelium via protein kinase C- and cytoskeleton-dependent up-regulation of the surface expression of alpha v beta 3 integrin.",

The first set of variants was obtained by recovery, and establishment in culture, of 'spontaneous' lung metastases obtained 5-6 months after subcutaneous inoculation of the parent MeWo line. That these metastases arose by a nonrandom process, and were authentic variants, was shown by the fact that they were always highly aneuploid, having predominantly near-triploid or near-tetraploid chromosome numbers. In contrast, the parent MeWo cells had a predominant hypodiploid chromosome mode with a minor population (less than 10%) of near-tetraploid cells. A second set of variants was obtained through in vitro selection of cloned lectin-resistant (Lecr) aneuploid 'membrane mutants' from MeWo, using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as the selective agent. Some of these mutants manifested an extraordinary ability to disseminate widely and extensively to many extrapulmonary sites after intravenous inoculation of the cells; furthermore, the metastases, even those less than 0.5 mm in diameter ('pinhead' sized), were easily visible because of the remarkably intense pigmented nature of the mutant cells.

Morphologically tumor showed distinctive biphasic population of cells, large epitheloid cells with voluminous eosinophillic cytoplasm and smaller cells with much lesser amount of cytoplasm and small rounded nuclei. The smaller cells at places clustered around hyaline pink material forming \"pseudorosettes\". population. Immunohistochemically both types of tumor cells showed negativity for pan CK (cytokeratin), EMA (epitheleal membrane antigen) and TFE3 (transcription factor E3). HMB 45 (human melanoma black 45) and Melan- A /MART 1 (melanoma antigen recognized by T cells) were moderate to strongly expressed.;On review of literature, most RCCs with t(6;11) translocation have been reported to be negative for pan cytokeratins and EMA. Published literature also shows that the most distinctive immunohistochemical feature of t(6;11) translocation RCC is nuclear staining for TFEB protein. Immunostains for TFE3 have always been negative in the reported cases. It is noteworthy that immunoreactivity for melanocytic markers HMB45 and Melan A and immunonegativity for epithelial markers pan CK and EMA may lead to misdiagnosis of angiomyolipoma to the unwary.;Knowledge of distinctive morphological and immuno-histochemical features of this tumor can help in establishing a diagnosis of this rare subset of translocation associated RCC on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining and immunophenotyping.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Syntenin is a PDZ domain-containing adaptor protein that has been recently shown to regulate migration and invasion in several tumors. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is notorious for its invasiveness and strong potential for metastasis. We therefore studied the influence of syntenin on the invasiveness of SCLC. Immunohistochemistry in tumor tissues showed that syntenin was more frequently expressed in small cell carcinomas than other neuroendocrine tumors, such as carcinoids and neuroblastomas, suggesting that syntenin expression may be related to more aggressive forms of neuroendocrine tumors. In SCLC patients, syntenin overexpression in tumor cells was significantly associated with more extensive and advanced disease at the time of diagnosis (P=0.029). Overexpression of syntenin in SCLC cells that were intrinsically syntenin-low increased the invasiveness of cells and led to the induction of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). In contrast, suppression of syntenin in syntenin-high cells was associated with the downregulation of MT1-MMP. Contrary to the results of previous studies using malignant melanomas and breast carcinomas, signaling cascades were shown to be further transduced through p38 MAPK and PI3K/AKT, with activation of SP1 rather than NF-ÎºB, under circumstances not involving ECM interaction. In addition, the upstream molecule focal adhesion kinase was induced by syntenin activation, in spite of the absence of ECM interaction. These results suggest that syntenin might contribute to the invasiveness of SCLC and could be utilized as a new therapeutic target for controlling invasion and metastasis in SCLC. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"These studies define a new mechanism-based approach to radiosensitize tumor cure by single dose radiotherapy (SDRT). Published evidence indicates that SDRT induces acute microvascular endothelial apoptosis initiated via acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) translocation to the external plasma membrane. Ensuing microvascular damage regulates radiation lethality of tumor stem cell clonogens to effect tumor cure. Based on this biology, we engineered an ASMase-producing vector consisting of a modified pre-proendothelin-1 promoter, PPE1(3x), and a hypoxia-inducible dual-binding HIF-2Î±-Ets-1 enhancer element upstream of the asmase gene, inserted into a replication-deficient adenovirus yielding the vector Ad5H2E-PPE1(3x)-ASMase. This vector confers ASMase over-expression in cycling angiogenic endothelium in vitro and within tumors in vivo, with no detectable enhancement in endothelium of normal tissues that exhibit a minute fraction of cycling cells or in non-endothelial tumor or normal tissue cells. Intravenous pretreatment with Ad5H2E-PPE1(3x)-ASMase markedly increases SDRT cure of inherently radiosensitive MCA/129 fibrosarcomas, and converts radiation-incurable B16 melanomas into biopsy-proven tumor cures. In contrast, Ad5H2E-PPE1(3x)-ASMase treatment did not impact radiation damage to small intestinal crypts as non-dividing small intestinal microvessels did not overexpress ASMase and were not radiosensitized. We posit that combination of genetic up-regulation of tumor microvascular ASMase and SDRT provides therapeutic options for currently radiation-incurable human tumors. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"A murine monoclonal antibody, ME20, with high selectivity for melanomas, has been utilized to isolate a unique membrane-bound (designated ME20-M) and secreted (designated ME20-S) antigen from H3606 human melanoma cells. ME20-M was purified from the cell lysate and ME20-S from the conditioned medium of H3606 cells by immunoaffinity chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weights were 105,000 and 76,000, respectively. Analyses of ME20-M and ME20-S by amino acid sequencing identified the processing sites. Signal peptide cleavage occurs at Thr-24 of pro-ME20 antigen, yielding ME20-M (25 to 661). In addition, proteolytic processing of the precursor at Val-467 yields ME20-S (25 to 467). We report the characterization of Asn-linked glycosylation sites in ME20-M and ME20-S to determine the involvement of oligosaccharides in the proteolytic processing of pro-ME20 antigen. Tryptic peptide maps of ME20-M and ME20-S were prepared and the glycosylation sites identified by sequence analyses. Oligosaccharides were enzymatically released and characterized by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. We found high-mannose-type structures at Asn-57, Asn-82, and Asn-87 of ME20-M, whereas ME20-S contained 73% complex-type and 27% high-mannose-type oligosaccharides at the same sites. To assess the role of oligosaccharides in the processing of the ME20 antigen, we tested the effect of the oligosaccharide processing modifier deoxymannojirimycin, a compound that inhibits synthesis of hybrid- and complex-type oligosaccharides. Deoxymannojirimycin had no effect on the synthesis and relative rate of synthesis of ME20-M, but markedly reduced the synthesis of ME20-S without affecting the rate of secretion. The reported results suggest that carbohydrate maturation of the ME20 antigen may be important for processing and secretion.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The M6P/IGF-II receptor belongs to the IGF system which plays a crucial role in tumorigenicity. While the role of the IGF-I receptor in signal transduction is well documented, previous experiments failed to uncover a clear signalling function for the M6P/IGF-II receptor. However, more recent studies have shown the capability of M6P/IGF-II receptor to initiate transmembrane signalling.;Human melanoma cells were used to detect the cell surface expression of the M6P/IGF-II receptor and its modulation by different effectors and monoclonal anti-receptor antibodies.;M6P (5 mM) caused an increase of the luminescent receptor signal of about 50% . Pre-incubation of cells with Act-D (5 microg/mL) or CHI (10 microg/mL) following M6P stimulation in the presence of the inhibitors caused a reduction of receptor cell surface expression of 27% or 31%, respectively. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2G11 was able to mimic the M6P effect on the receptor up-regulation but the mAb MEM-238 did not. The synergistic effect detected with the combination of M6P and the mAb 2G11 and the failure of 2G11 to compete with the M6P action suggests that both effectors have different binding sites on the receptor. Unlike 2G11 the mAb MEM-238 prevented the M6P effect on receptor up-regulation confirming partially overlapping binding epitopes of both effectors. Brefeldin A was shown to have an inhibiting effect on the vesicular transport of the receptor protein to the plasma membrane and forskolin had an activating effect on the receptor exocytosis with the following enhanced integration into the plasma membrane.;Up-regulation of the tumour suppressor M6P/IGF-II receptor might represent an approach for anticancer therapy.

In the present study, the effect of membrane-bound melanotransferrin (mMTf), also known as human melanoma antigen p97, on cell surface plasminogen binding and activation was investigated by using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells transfected with full-length melanotransferrin (MTf) cDNA and SK-MeL-28 melanoma cells. The expression of mMTf in CHO increased cell surface plasminogen binding by about 2-fold. In addition, application of the monoclonal antibody L235 against MTf as well as truncated, soluble MTf (sMTf) abolished plasminogen binding to MTf-transfected and SK-MeL-28 cells, indicating that mMTf is a potential cell surface plasminogen receptor. Moreover, mMTf expression in CHO cells stimulates plasminogen activation at the cell surface by about 2.5-fold. In addition to the induced binding and activation of plasminogen, cell motility, migration and invasion were about 3-fold higher in CHO cells expressing mMTf. Both monoclonal antibody L235 and truncated sMTf inhibited mMTf-stimulated CHO cell motility, migration and invasion. Overall, our results indicate a key role for mMTf in cell surface plasminogen binding and in activation processes involved during cell migration and invasion.",

Here we report on the efficacy of this strategy in two different mouse models of adoptive tumorigenesis, based on the implantation of human Kaposi sarcoma (KS-IMM) cells in nude mice or of B16F10 melanoma cells in syngeneic C57BL/6J mice. Experiments were performed by the subcutaneous injection of mixtures of unmodified tumor cells containing different fractions of TK or Tat11-TK producing cells followed by animal treatment with ganciclovir (GCV). In both systems we consistently found that mice bearing tumors containing Tat11-TK cells displayed significantly retarded tumor growth and prolonged survival as compared with mice inoculated with cells expressing unmodified TK. Collectively, these results demonstrate that fusion of Tat11 to TK imparts remarkable intercellular trafficking capability to the enzyme.
